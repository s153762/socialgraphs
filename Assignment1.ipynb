Calculate the average of $\\langle d \\rangle$ as well as the standard deviation over the 50 networks, to create a plot that shows how the path length decreases very quickly with only a little fraction of re-wiring. Use the standard deviation to add errorbars to the plot. My version of the plot is below (since a picture's worth 1000 words).\n",
