Jack briefly had the chest taken from him, but Krystal got it from the cursed captain. As Will Turner lay helpless, Jack prepared to stab the heart of Jones. in a quandary, Jones jabbed his rapier into Turner leaving him to die. While Bootstrap Bill was angered over his dead son, Sparrow realized the way to save his friend and old foe. Sparrow then put his sword in Turner's hand and made it stab the heart. With Davy Jones finally dead, the heroes escape, while Turner is left on board the Dutchman. With the storm over, Krystal and Sparrow then fend off the Endeavor with the ship cannons until the Dutchman appears, now captained by Will.

Indeed however her vision came true, but somehow Andross had a clone body and possibly more, this triggered another Lylat war although strangely the former home base of Andross Venom had no sign of the Venomian Army or Andross at all, this started worrying Krystal awfully as she said to Peppy who now was the current General of the Cornarian Army that she has always knew that he would come back to haunt the Lylat system. Four weeks later on board the Great Fox, Andross made an ambush on the Star Fox team and brutally damaged the ship and attempted to lure Fox into his death but was not deceived by his foul actions, so he ordered the ship to hyperspace out of the trap and so they did but during the battle Andross said to Fox that he only wanted to take what was rightfully his, meaning Krystal and her unborn child, Fox had to hide her until he could find Andross and kill him and destroy the Venomian Army, so Fox sent Krystal to the planet Gev, an oasis with grassy plains and towering spires which she had been for a week until she was nearly kidnapped by a spy who threatens to kill her if she did not go to Andross but successfully had Fox arrive in time to rescue her from abduction. Fox knew that he was being spied on by a Cornarian agent who had information on Krystal's whereabouts, and told Andross so that he could get payed by him but immediately Fox knew that the agent was up to something and threatened to injure him so the agent told him about the plot to abduct Krystal so Fox reached to Gev and just when Krystal was brawling with the Venomian assassin who had a tranquilizer to knock her out but gets shot by Fox who immediately barges into her room and came to her aid and Fox told her that she was no longer safe there and they left the next day, but Fox knew he had to be with her at all times."}], "images": []}]}, {"sections": [{"title": "Mccloud Family", "level": 1, "content": [], "images": []}, {"title": "(0) Mac Cloud, the great", "level": 2, "content": [{"type": "paragraph", "text": "The First Mccloud.

It was during this civil war that an alien race known as the Overseers invaded Robloxia, though were soon driven off-world in the fighting. While the Korbloxians and Redclifflings were driven to extinction in the subsequent Blox Crusades and the Great Magic War, the Noobs remained a semi-autonomous nation as a vassal of the Kingdom of Robloxia. Another civil war occurred between three political factions known as the Royalists, the Imperialists, and the Federalists. The Federalists and Imperialists united to form the Imperial Robloxian Federation, while the Royalists reformed the Kingdom into the Robloxian Republic; this event ushered in the Modern Era. A number of independent nations continued to exist on Kor and a number of outlying islands, though conflicts between these nations and the Republic were few and far between for the following decades. The most notable conflict of the Modern Era was the World War, which involved every nation, clan, and city-state on Robloxia.

Although they tried to persuade him to stop, Paradox refuses to do so, and a 3-on-1 Duel begins with Yugi, Jaden and Yusei sharing 4000 Life Points. Yusei shows his skills as a Synchro duelist by Summoning \"Junk Gardna\". However, after Yugi manages to rescue \"Stardust Dragon\" and destroy Paradox's \"Malefic Paradox Dragon\", Paradox Special Summons his most powerful card, \"Malefic Truth Dragon\". He then fuses himself with the dragon, and destroys all of Yusei, Jaden and Yugi's monsters on the field. Yusei loses hope and prepares to surrender, until Yami Yugi and Jaden manage to convince him to keep fighting until the end. With new hope, Yusei manages to re-Summon the monsters Paradox destroyed in his last turn and gets a power boost from trap cards played by Yami Yugi and Jaden, increasing \"Stardust Dragon's\" ATK to 10000, allowing him to destroy \"Malefic Truth Dragon\" and defeat Paradox. With Paradox defeated, all the damage he caused is repaired. Yusei bids farewell to Yugi and Jaden, before returning to his own timeline, where his friends await. Yusei vows to protect the future so he can meet Yugi and Jaden again. In this non-canon episode, Yusei has a"}, {"type": "paragraph", "text": "nother Turbo Duel with his rival, Jack Atlas.

It was then that Adalina met a representative of the Royal Apothecary Society in Silvermoon who came to her to warn her that he had discovered the source of the madness: a plague. Knowing that the Apothecary was well versed in plagues, Adalina had no choice but to believe him. Together, along with her companions, the Apothecary set out to discover the source of the plague only to find out that its origin was of nature itself, tainted with the madness of the Emerald Nightmare. It could be spread by any means of contact and worked so quickly to kill the host that Adalina wondered if a cure might even be possible. Not to be deterred by shattered hope, she began to devise a defense against the now dubbed Emerald Plague.  Attempt after attempt failed, Adalina and her companions began to grow worried. Though the mage among them had managed to devise a spell which would kill the spores of the fungus in an infected victim, the plague was spreading faster than they could cure it. Finding less and less outlets in which she could seek answers, she set out to Moonglade where she met with a council of Elders at theGathering of Druids. There she was introduced to an elder Plagueshifter named Wyldhorn. With reluctance, Elder Wyldhorn agreed to assist the troubled Druid. In Quel'thalas Wyldhorn was able to sanction a region of Eversong Woods where she blessed the land and made it a haven where the sick could come and await, safely, their salvation. Hope was upon Adalina once more until she began to see just how many of the sick were being brought to the haven. They numbered in the hundreds from all across the Eastern Kingdoms."}, {"type": "paragraph", "text": "Not to be undone, Adalina charged Eragios to train other mages in the painful curing of the sick while she and Rothain Highmesa wandered outside of Quel'thalas in search of an answer. It was during these travels that they came across a dragon of the Green Dragonflight who called herself Ysondre. Seeing Ysondre in such a state of madness, Adalina and Rothain suspected that she, too, had become infected by the Grimtotem's Emerald Plague and so set forth to free her from her torment. It was then that they met the Death Knights of the Forgotten Legion. A tenuous pact between the two Druids and the Death Knights was formed for the sole purpose of killing Ysondre."}, {"type": "paragraph", "text": "A battle like no other waged. Ysondre would not yield easily. The dragon could not contend with the might of the others, however, and fell to the ground, slain. The Death Knights, as a trophy, severed the head of the massive beast after the Druids performed their prayers. Something fell from the throat of the beast; a black sphere which Adalina and Rothain could easily sense was deeply corrupted by the Emerald Nightmare. Even with their warnings, the Death Knights assumed ownership of the corrupted orb."}, {"type": "paragraph", "text": "The Nightmare's magic worked quickly. By the end of that same night the Death Knights, feeling as though they had been cursed by their collection of the item, plead with Adalina to cure them. Adalina saw this opportunity of possibility the cleansing of the orb may unlock the mystery of the plague in her homeland. So, against Rothain's advice, the two Druids guided the Death Knights to Moonglade where Adalina came before Remulos once again to seek his help. Remulos took the corrupted orb with great haste and threw it vengefully into the waters of Lake Elune'ara."}, {"type": "paragraph", "text": "What happened next many have debated Adalina's sincerity regarding. An image of Malfurion Stormrage himself appeared from within the lake's depths. To Remulos and the Druids he warned that the Emerald Nightmare was seeking a new host to be freed from the Emerald Dream. Naturally it was only then made clear that the Emerald Plague's creator was the host of that corrupted power's attempt. Malfurion offered to the Druids passage into the Emerald Dream where he gave unto them Emerald Acorns. Curious and hope renewed, Adalina returned quickly to Quel'thalas and began to make the acorns into what could be used on others, then brought these salves to the haven where she administered them among the sick. To her great relief, the attempt was a success."}, {"type": "paragraph", "text": "Slowly but surely does the last remnants of the Emerald Plague settle into extinction. The creator of the Emerald Plauge, the mysterious Grimtotem, was never found."}, {"type": "paragraph", "text": "News of Adalina and her friends' efforts to defeat the Emerald Plague spread far and drew the attention of Shu'halo from all over. Many traveled to Silvermoon to meet her and some even stayed to join in the effort of healing the\u00a0Dead Scar which Adalina could once again place all of her focus on. Before too long the Eversong Tribe was born. Through a series of months-long trials and errors, the tribe discovered how to neutralize the Scourge corruption in the soil. It took a great deal of time to treat every inch of the Dead Scar, and Adalina will be the first to confess of her uncertainty regarding its success, but the haunted soil was prepared to allow nature to reclaim her land and grow anew."}, {"type": "paragraph", "text": "This mission complete, Adalina set forth to migrate the tribe out of her longtime home and rejoin her kin in the plains of Mulgore. It was a long and arduous journey but the tribe eventually managed upon Thunder Bluff where Adalina made it a quick purpose to introduce herself to the local tribal chiefs in an effort to secure friendship. What she discovered, instead, was a people with whom she had no relation. She was shocked to learn that many of the Old Ways of their peoples' culture to which she still dearly held seemed to be all but forgotten in the others. Coupled with her ties and habits brought upon by a lifetime among the Blood Elves, she began to feel increasingly alien among her own kind.  The tribesmen eventually began to separate, taking advantage of their newfound peace to pursue their personal endeavors. One by one the tribe became smaller and eventually Adalina was forced to call an end to the band of brothers that'd bonded for the sake of their Earth Mother. The decision was bittersweet, for Adalina had been contemplating returning back to the familiar people of Quel'thalas, unable to comprehend the new and more violent ways of the Kalimdor Shu'halo tribes. Feeling that the Orcs had influenced their culture too greatly, Adalina packed up her belongings and returned to the familiarity of the Golden City. Upon her arrival to Silvermoon she learned of a time-honored school for the Blood Elves had reawakened from hibernation and was seeking knowledgable minds and those eager to learn from them. She had always enjoyed offering her counsel to the Blood Elves in the past, and so, a formal meeting with the headmistress of the\u00a0Silvermoon Academy granted her a place among them with a new purpose based solely on nurturing the minds of the students within the challenging curriculums of the Academy's professors. Peace and balance reigned within Adalina once again and remained prevalent for a great deal of time. It was not until the late winter of that year she began to feel another calling. She'd begun making regular trips to Thunder Bluff where she began making friends and forming ties with the honored Earthspear Tribe in the land. The tribe's Elder Seer, Kokochu Winterhoof, and Adalina began to form the strong bonds of friendship. Realizing the two came from brethren tribes that shared the snowy northern Winterspring land and carrying the traditions of their ancestors together, it is that bond which motivated her aid to the Earthspear when Kokochu challenged Huatar Earthspear for the rights of Chieftain over the tribe. Even after victory does Adalina act as an unofficial advisor to the Earthspear, feeling it her honor to offer them what aid she can as a Shu'halo."}, {"type": "paragraph", "text": "As she'd begun to wonder what drives her to commune with her new Mulgore friends, it was one day a trip to The Barrens which was the catalyst for it all to begin making sense. It was a shock to her senses to see, mixed beneath the golden longstem grass that had been the life of The Barrens for generations that a carpet of green was growing as far as the eye could see. Concerned and excited, she sought the opinion of other Shu'halo to include Kokochu and most of them hailed the change as a wonderous victory. Adalina was not convinced, however. The speed at which the green grass was growing went against all of her grand knowledge of natures' spirits' ways. Attempt to commune with the land's spirits, also, revealed nothing. The spirits were silent."}, {"type": "paragraph", "text": "It was one night speaking with Kokochu in the main hut on Elder Rise that, seemingly randomly, her old friend Elder Wyldhorn arrived. Adalina and Wyldhorn held a brief, warm reunion when Adalina told the Plagueshifter of the changes that she had been witnessing. Wyldhorn, in turn, informed Adalina that the fungal life in Felwood was also randomly beginning to change with no word from the land's spirits. Wyldhorn and Adalina together decided to send a calling to the Shu'halo Druids of Azeroth to reconvene the Druid Council under Elder Wyldhorn's guidance. Adalina then returned to Silvermoon City and her duties to her Sin'dorei friends, though continued to make regular trips to Thunder Bluff to aid and visit with her Earthspear friends as well."}, {"type": "paragraph", "text": "It was during one of those visits that Kokochu confessed to Adalina that he was beginning to share her concern regarding the changes of the land. He informed her of quakes that had begun to rock Mulgore and could not get answers from the elements. Adalina began to piece events together, from the seemingly random desire to come to Thunder Bluff where she met her Earthspear friends, then the discovery of the changes, the return of Wyldhorn, and her concern worsened. After returning to Silvermoon, sitting inside the Wayfarer's Rest Tavern, the ground quaked and shook the building. All activity stopped and silence blanketed the room before a second and more powerful quake occurred, toppling elves and tables. Shaken and recovering, all eyes turned on a wordless and shocked Adalina. Her concern, at that moment, turned into fear."}, {"type": "paragraph", "text": "It was that which led her, then, to pack her belongings and depart Quel'thalas to pursue this mystery. To Mulgore her travels landed her where, after a great deal of convincing by the new Chieftain of the Earthspear Tribe, Adalina finally joined among them. Tribal life began to reintegrate itself into her as easily as it had left her. The memories of life in the Snowhoof began to resurface and peace began to swell in her veins. Before long it was decided that the Earthspear tribe had adopted its own identity, away from what the Earthspear once was.

Once proud warriors who lived for freedom, and strength, were now pitiful prisoners, trapped in both body and mid, who were weak, and wallowed in the mud and filth of their self-built prisons. This fate was something that all, almost all, of the orcs fell prey to. Bashkuga would have sooner taken his own life then allow himself such a fate, and attempted to once or twice by trying to force the guards to kill him as he attempted to escape. Instead, all he received were beatings, and imprisonment, locked in a pit for days on end. The humans would rather break his spirit then end his suffering.

He would carry twice, sometimes thrice, the load of dirty water and slop to his fellow prisoners, burning his back and legs with the weight of the load. He would pull the plow with as much speed and force as he could muster, tearing through the soil faster then even the stoutest of work horses, faster then his guard's whip could reach him.

The food and water she consumed was not something to raise an unborn child on, and as the months rolled by, her body withered and her strength left her. Was it not for her powerful will to see her child live, she would have died months before she was prepared to give labor, but she did not, and the child was born. The last of her strength sapped, she died, leaving the child to fend for itself, a small squeal resounding from one of the hollowed out shacks that the Orcs had been locked in.

It was agonizingly slow, but with his new baggage in tow, he felt it was the most reasonable way to ensure they both remained undetected.

He'd spent months there, scavenging for shelter from day to day, never staying in one place long enough to think of it as anything more then a camp, ever making his way North, farther and father away from the territories of the human encampments.

He knew the water would slow him down enough for the Fish-man to make it's way to the infant long before he had even reached the shore. In that instant, the warrior in him took over and he flung the spear, which had already impaled one fish that day, which caught the Murloc dead in the throat. There was twitching and spurting of blood, but that night, Bashkuga had his first taste of Murloc Meat.

Every night, when all he could feel was the surging of his blood like the march of an army and the pounding of his heart like a great war drum, he knew that he thirsted for battle. Not with beast, but with a warrior. One clad in armor, that fought on more then just instinct and the need to survive. One that would test his wits as well as his strength.

Raz is thus forced to set things right by himself, and uses a bathysphere to follow the monster, being deathly afraid of large bodies of water due to a curse on his entire family that will cause them all to drown in deep water. After engaging the Lungfish in battle, Raz finds that Lili is not with it, but Ford Cruller tells him the monster was once an ordinary lungfish, mutated and brainwashed by Oleander and Loboto. Using the Psycho-Portal from Sasha's lab, Raz journeys deep into the lungfish's mind and frees it from Oleander's control.

On one tragic occasion, Eugen's sister, the woman who one day would become The Baroness, accompanied him on what would result in a deal gone bad. Eugen was fatally wounded just as another soldier later known as Snake-Eyes burst in and killed Eugen's murderers. His sister, who had been in another room, believed that the soldier had destroyed both her brother and his supposedly peaceful contacts. This set her on a course of revenge that would lead her into a life of international terrorism. She joined the ranks of COBRA, rising to become its top intelligence agent. The Baroness is a highly intelligent and ambitious individual, and a world-class expert in cryptography, psychological warfare, and bio-chemical skin-irritants. She is full of contradictions: cynical yet romantic, calculating but naive, blunt and prone to beating around the bush. She is qualified in most small arms, including the M-16, AK-47, RPG 7, and the Uzi. She is also an experienced H.I.S.S. tank operator, and her military specialties include helicopter and fixed wing pilot. Her principle weakness is in the division of her loyalty between Cobra Commander and Destro.

Joe team in Washington, DC. He manned the turret of the HISS tank that was being driven by the Baroness. In the midst of the battle, Cobra Commander ordered Bludd to kill Destro. The Major took aim at Destro, but the Baroness realized what he was about to do and swerved, ruining Bludd's shot. The out-of-control tank crashed, and Bludd ran from the burning wreck, leaving the Baroness trapped inside as it exploded. The Baroness survived, but was badly burned by the blast.

It's pilot set explosives to destroy the fortress perched atop the Pit. He also decided to leave Scar-face in his cell, but Bludd was soon stopped in his tracks, held at gunpoint by General Flagg. Scar-face then kicked the pistol from Flagg's hands, allowing Bludd to pick up the gun and fire on Flagg, killing him.

Their only stumbling block was Storm Shadow, who freed the Commander from the Joes. After the Commander returned to Springfield, Bludd was thrown into a jail cell for his treachery. The Baroness soon offered Bludd his freedom, in exchange for his help in planning the assassination of Cobra Commander. They sought out a boy named Billy, working in Springfield's anti-Cobra underground resistance. The brutal Bludd turned Billy into an assassin and provided him with the weapon to kill the Commander. The stage was set, and at a Cobra rally, Billy approached the Commander as a Cobra youth, holding a bouquet of flowers. The Commander was about to be gunned down when Destro stopped the boy from firing. His explanation was more surprising than his actions. He had recognized the boy -- he was Cobra Commander's son. In the inquest that followed, Bludd was pleased that the boy refused to give up his accomplices.

General Thurston Crowther, head of the committee of generals known as the Jugglers, sent Snake-Eyes on that mission, but he also secretly hired Major Bludd to kill Snake-Eyes. Strawhacker had been leaking false information to the Soviets, and if he returned to the United States, the false information would have been suspect. At the same time, Snake-Eyes' rescue attempt was staged so it would appear someone had tried to rescue Strawhacker. As the he arrived in the midst of ritoing Borovians, Bludd assured Metz, the man who hoped to be leader of the new Borovia, that his mission was for the good of the people of his country. When Strawhacker was killed anyway, Bludd opted not to kill Snake-Eyes, since Strawhacker's death made it unnecessary. He then sold out Metz by telling the people his plans.

Hawk was upset to discover that they learned of the bombs' locations after beating up a terrorist found in the camp, carrying bomb-making equipment. The interrogation was carried out by Lonzo \"Stalker\" Wilkinson, a sergeant under Hawk's command. Stalker had known the explosives had to be found quickly, and did whatever he could to get the information to find them. The major general to whom Hawk reported was livid over what had happened, and became even more upset when Hawk refused to give up Stalker and took responsibility for what had occurred. He admitted that it had been wrong, but he would have done the same thing in Stalker's place. Hawk believed that the blame for such a necessary evil should be placed at the top of the chain of command, and wanted to see who was willing to accept it. Hawk was court-martialed for the incident, but his principled stand impressed General Lawrence J. Flagg.

Though he spent much of his time running operations from Joe headquarters, Hawk quickly gained the respect of his soldiers and participated in a number of early missions, including the rescue of Dr. Adele Burkhart from Cobra.

Fortunately for Buster, his mother was well-versed in these techniques and worked patiently aside Buster to encourage him to break out of his shell, encouraging such \"baby steps\" feats as making it a goal to just say \"hi\" to one person his age. Occasionally when put in an unpleasant situation, Buster would cease conversation altogether, freaking out his mother as this behavior would last days, not hours. Susan responded by upping her son's speech therapy sessions, but even that approach failed to bring the youngest Witwicky to utter a word if he was overly distressed.

In his case, he virtually bunkered himself in his shell. With the loss of the one parental member who understood his struggles, Buster shut down.

The catch was that the discipline had to be dealt in a way that would give the illusion of control. When Buster was forced to stay at Ron and Judy's (Buster's aunt), he was awarded a room where he could do anything he wished in terms of decor. In addition, he was given equal voice in determining family meals. Most reassuring was that Ron set the boundary that Buster could shut his door and he had the full authority to allow or not allow Ron or Judy into his room.

Ron's easygoing attitude toward his nephew was summed up by him saying \"It's no different than raising a deaf child.\" Sparkplug didn't appreciate the humor.

Ron and Judy later took on the responsibility of raising Buster full-time while he went to junior high.

By doing this, Sparkplug hoped that when Buster was older (around 14 or 15), he would join the family at the Ark and help the Autobots defeat the Decepticons.

However, he was equally pissed when the mass population, instead of rejecting both factions, blindly threw their support to the Decepticons. Still, he hoped that Spike and Sparkplug would return and eventually begin resuming a normal family life (but only after getting a tomato or two thrown at them by an angry mob). That dream was short-lived when Spike and Sparkplug were captured by the Decepticons and were forced to work in an energy processing plant.

Buster continued to cope with being an outcast the only way he knew how: by retreating inward and escaping into books and science fiction.

However, I'm not Perceptor or Ratchet. If you have any questions about this, please contact any member of your science team.

I'm hoping it's okay. *Spike takes another look at his 3x5 card, then looks at the camera* On behalf of the citizens of Earth, I come to you in an offer of peace and fellowship. My name is Spike Witwicky. I'm one of about 7 and a half billion other humans who currently inhabit Earth. Before I get to the specifics, I thought I would give you a very quick overview of who we are as a species. We are one of millions of species who have or are currently occupying our planet. Out of these species, we are considered the most advanced species of our planet. We've been in existence in this form for about 200,000 years. And while there are some exceptions, we generally have two genders - male and female. I'm of the 'male' gender. We reproduce sexually with the female gender. Our general life span is about 80 years. Not all humans look like me. We have scores of varieties of people of different skin colors, millions who speak languages different than what you're hearing now, and all of us go through a very similar process of aging. In 200,000 years, we have gone from living in caves and hunting and gathering our food to developing technology that can take us to our moon, creating ways to extend our life spans, and making works of art that have lasted centuries. I will briefly tell you my story. My creators, or what we call parents, created me about 45 years ago. I came from a family who the female, or mother, dedicated her life to teaching young humans, called 'children.' My father, the male, made his living with his hands, building things that gave many humans energy to power their homes, and their vehicles. I lost my mother about 35 years ago, and not a day goes by where I don't think about her. About 30 years ago, my father and I were on a oil platform when we were attacked by the Decepticons, who were dormant for almost four-and-a-half million years on this planet. The Autobots fought off the Decepticons, and saved my father and I from certain death. Since then, we as citizens of Earth have worked closely with the Autobots. To my knowledge, if you wish to pursue diplomatic relations with us, you would be the second interstellar species we have met in our 200,000 year history on this planet. It is my hope that we can both learn from one another, and foster a friendship that is as deep as we have with the Autobots.

I know there's a pressing matter on Cybertron involving the Fallen. Unfortunately, we have another crisis on hand. Autobot intelligence has detected transmissions between Cybertron and 'The Hive' - a group of beings that supposedly 'control' the planet Nebulos. I've spoken with Zarak, who appears to be the 'grand leader' of all Nebulos. He's confirmed he's been speaking with the Decepticons. If the Nebulans form an alliance with the Decepticons, it will be a huge setback for the Autobots. From what we've gathered, Nebulos is rich in energy. In addition, they have a population that is highly advanced. Far more advanced than the humans on Earth. What's more - it appears that the Nebulans have the ability of telekinesis. What's not confirmed, but I have my suspicions, is that they also may be telepathic. Again, this is just a theory. We don't know much about this planet. And if they are telepathic, I don't know if it's just between themselves, or if they can read human minds, Autobot minds, or both. All I know is that whenever I meet with Zarak, I feel like he can see right through me, so it's useless to deceive him. He knows we've been in contact with Gort - a Nebulan who is leading the resistance against The Hive. *Spike pauses, seeming to choose the next few sentences very carefully* Zarak seems to know what he's getting into with the Decepticons. Regardless, I've showed him one of the planets the Decepticons bled dry of their resources. I showed him how easily the Decepticons tricked the people of Earth to believe the Autobots were evil about 30 years ago, and as a result, the Autobots were exiled from Earth. He saw how soon they enslaved us. But Zarak freely admits he's a tyrant, and he knows how to handle a tyrant like Megatron. *Spike pinches the bridge of his nose* I have suspicions that Zarak has enslaved the population of Nebulos - and because of this, we would NOT want an alliance with him. That said, I'm also afraid of forging an alliance with Gort, because if we align ourselves with the resistance, it will only push Zarak to the Decepticons. This decision needs to be made by upper Autobot leadership, but in my opinion, I think the best option is just to play 'defense.' In other words, if we can convince Zarak to NOT partner with the Decepticons, that would be a 'win.' Of course, the Autobots could likely overthrow The Hive, and establish a new government in Nebulos, but we've seen how disastrous getting into the affairs of others can sometimes be, regardless of the intentions. As sad as it is, Gort and his people will have to be the ones to gain their freedom. But in the meantime, Zarak has said that he's had not trouble getting the Decepticons ear, and he has heard nothing from the Autobots. Therefore, and again, I know everyone is justly occupied with The Fallen, but we NEED some Autobots to engage with Zarak, ASAP. I think I convinced him with the evidence of how the Decepticons plunder other planets - to hold off on an alliance, but this may be short-term. If the Decepticons form an alliance with the Nebulans, I fear they may possess a threat that could be as grave as the Quintessons.
