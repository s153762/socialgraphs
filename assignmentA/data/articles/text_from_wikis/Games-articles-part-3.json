Born in Sparta, Kratos was a respected soldier and General, up until he lost his wife and daughter when he killed them, albeit by accident, under Ares' command, earning him his nickname The Ghost of Sparta, after which he renounced his service to the war god, eventually killing him and later on ascending to Godhood before exacting revenge against his father, the Olympians and the Titans who betrayed him. After successfully exacting his vengeance, Kratos escaped into the world of Norse Gods by settling down in Midgard in Ancient Norway where he married another woman named Faye and bore a son named Atreus who together, after the boy's mother\u2019s death, would embark on a journey to spread her ashes at the highest peak of all the nine realms.Biography Early life  Born in the Greek city-state of Sparta, Kratos is the demigod son of Zeus and a mortal woman named Callisto, although he would remain unaware of who his father was for most of his life. Outraged at Zeus for fathering yet another bastard child, Hera ordered Kratos' execution on the day he was born, but the King of the Gods took pity on the child and refused, leaving him in Sparta to be raised by Callisto. Like all Spartan youth, Kratos was monitored and trained for combat by the Spartan authorities; those who were deemed fit were to stay and be trained as Spartan warriors, while those who were deemed unfit would be sent to the mountains (probably Mount Taygetos) to fend for themselves. Already feisty and aggressive at a young age, Kratos trained together with his younger brother, Deimos, as they dreamed of joining the Spartan army when they grew up. Around this time, Zeus began to hear prophecies foretelling his demise at the hands of one of his sons, a \"marked warrior\". Hoping to circumvent the cycle of patricide before it was too late, Zeus sent Ares and Athena to hunt down and dispose of the boy who would one day rise up against him. Ares, noticing Deimos' strange birthmarks, decided to invade Sparta with an army of centaurs and take him to Thanatos, the God of Death. Kratos tried to save his brother, but Ares punched him into a pile of wood, leaving him with a permanent scar over his right eye. Insulted by the mortal's defiance, Ares prepared to kill the young Spartan\u00a0but was stopped by Athena. The Goddess reminded Ares that they had what they were looking for, and apologized to Kratos before disappearing into the flames. The loss of his brother left an indelible mark on Kratos, as he vowed to never falter again. In honor of his brother, Kratos had himself tattooed in the exact image of Deimos' birthmark. Kratos would later forget that it was Ares and Athena who took his brother from him\u00a0and wouldn't realize it until after Ares' death. As Kratos came of age, he became a respected member of the Spartan army, eventually marrying Lysandra and siring a daughter, Calliope.Quest for the Ambrosia and Rising through the Ranks of The Spartan Army  Shortly after her birth, Calliope contracted a plague, causing the Spartan authorities to deem her weak. Spartan law required that she be thrown into a chasm and left to die. Determined to save his daughter, Kratos set out on a journey for the Ambrosia after hearing from an elder of its exceptional healing capabilities. But unbeknownst to Kratos, Ares had chosen him to be his champion in the wager of the Gods, a contest with the ultimate goal being the capture of the Ambrosia; the victor would have statues erected in their honor all throughout Greece. A battalion of Spartans accompanied Kratos on his quest, including Captain Nikos. Along the way, he encountered a healer who gave him the Flames of Apollo. Kratos eventually encountered Poseidon's champion, Herodius, and killed him as the Spartans conquered his army and stole their ship. Enraged at Kratos for costing him the wager, Poseidon unleashed a handful of hazards at sea in the hopes of killing him\u00a0but failed. Later on, Kratos encountered Artemis' champion, Pothia, and killed her as well, with her army also falling victim to the Spartans, although Artemis did not retaliate. In fear that Kratos would defeat his champion, Alrik, the Barbarian King, Hades sent a torrent of fire through the sky. Although he failed to kill Kratos, he succeeded in killing many of Kratos' men, including Captain Nikos. As he found the Ambrosia, Kratos encountered Cereyon, the Helios' champion, and killed him as well. Alrik and his Barbarian army battled the Spartans for the Ambrosia, as Alrik's Father was very ill and in need of the elixir. After a grueling battle between the two leaders, Kratos successfully captured the Ambrosia at the cost of his own men and summoned an army of Rocs to continuously torture Alrik. Kratos then returned to Sparta and healed Calliope, obtaining the rank of 'Captain' from the King of Sparta. At some point after becoming captain, Kratos would command a young soldier named Atreus who remained hopeful even in the darkest times. When the day came for Atreus to lay down his life, he did it without hesitation earning Kratos' respect and was buried by the captain himself who acknowledged him as the only Spartan who ever had a smile on his face even in battle.Birth of the Ghost  As a general, Kratos won battles through brutal, but effective tactics. However, his pride and hunger for power grew greater with every victory. Despite Lysandra's pleas, Kratos vowed to continue his bloody conquests \"until the glory of Sparta is known throughout the world\", spending time with his family only when he was able to return to Sparta.  Kratos and his army finally met their match when they encountered the merciless Barbarian tribes from the East, led by Kratos' old enemy, Alrik. Outnumbered and overpowered, the Spartans quickly found themselves on the losing end of the battle, with Kratos himself left at the mercy of Alrik the Barbarian King, who sought revenge against Kratos for inadvertently causing the death of his father. In desperation, Kratos\u00a0called out to Ares, the God of War, pledging his allegiance in exchange for victory. Ares accepted the offer, proceeding to kill all of the Barbarians, including Alrik, and giving Kratos the Blades of Chaos as a sign of his servitude. For a time, Kratos served Ares loyally, raiding villages, slaughtering innocents, and spreading chaos in his name. Under the God of War's influence, Kratos became utterly ruthless and gradually lost any semblance of the humanity he once had. One day, during a raid on a village of Athena's followers, Ares secretly transported Lysandra and Calliope to a nearby temple. Ignoring the village oracle's warnings, Kratos entered the temple and slaughtered everybody inside in a fit of blind rage, including his wife and child (whom he believed were still in Sparta). Ares justified this as a means of severing Kratos' remaining attachments to the world of mortals, thereby molding him into the perfect warrior. Stricken with horror and grief at what he had done, Kratos left the bodies of his family to be burned within the temple, ultimately renouncing his allegiance to the God of War. The oracle cursed Kratos, forcing him to forever wear the ashes of his dead family on his skin. From that day forward, Kratos became known as The Ghost of Sparta; his skin now 'pale as the moon' from the ashes that coated him. To other mortals, he was now marked by his ghostly white skin - the knowledge of his past actions often repulsed them to the point where they would rather die than allow him to save their lives. He became known as the personification of cruelty and selfishness. Word of this metamorphosis would spread even outside of Greece as Norse god and advisor to Odin, Mimir who would become a future ally to Kratos himself would later on instantly recognize who Kratos was.Redemption and Vengeance  For breaking his oath, Ares ordered The Furies to hunt down the Ghost of Sparta and force him to once again serve the God of War. Meanwhile, Kratos finds himself in the abandoned village of Kirra, where he is trapped in an illusion of his home in Sparta, with his blood oath inhibiting memories of him killing his wife and daughter. The Furies' oath-keeper,\u00a0Orkos, appeared before him and encouraged him to see past the illusion, using Lysandra's necklace and ring to break it. Although Kratos distrusted him, he followed Orkos' instruction to seek out Aletheia, the Oracle at Delphi. She had earlier been captured by Pollux and Castor,\u00a0but\u00a0Kratos killed them both and took the Amulet of Uroborus. He spoke with the dying oracle, who revealed Ares' plan to mold Kratos into a warrior capable of overthrowing Zeus, thereby allowing Ares to become the new King of Olympus. Kratos then traveled back to Kirra, where he encountered Orkos once again. The oath keeper revealed that he is the son of Ares and Alecto, one of the three Furies. Orkos explained Ares' intentions to Kratos. As Zeus had forbidden the Gods from waging war on one another, Ares sought to breed a warrior capable of destroying Zeus in his stead, so that Ares may usurp him and rule Olympus for himself. Disappointed in Orkos' complete lack of fighting skills, Ares disowned his son. Instead, Orkos became oath keeper of the Furies in an attempt to please his mother, Alecto. Ares saw in Kratos the makings of the warrior he needed to overthrow Zeus, and for that reason, he helped him against the Barbarians that day. The murder of his family was meant to be one of three \"tests\" that would bind Kratos to Ares' will: the slaughter of one's enemies, the slaughter of innocents, and the slaughter of one's own family. Orkos did his mother's bidding as oath keeper and did not question her until Ares tricked Kratos into killing his family. Armed with this knowledge, Kratos took a ship to Delos. Once there, Kratos traversed a giant, ruined statue of Apollo, where he was attacked by all three Furies. In the ensuing confrontation, Kratos managed to cut off Megaera's arm, but Alecto used her power to capture him. Orkos appeared and freed Kratos, escorting him to another location, with Alecto vowing that he would never succeed. After a perilous journey, Kratos used the Amulet of Uroborus to fully restore the statue and retrieve the Eyes from the Lantern. But after completing the Trials of Archimedes, he was once again ambushed by the Furies, who take him prisoner and steal both the Eyes and the Amulet. For two weeks, the Furies tortured Kratos in the Prison of the Damned. The Spartan eventually managed to free himself and pursued Megaera through the prison. She and Tisiphone attempted to misdirect him with an illusion of a brothel. When he went to sleep with a woman inside, he spotted a ring on her finger and realized that it was a trick. He responded by tackling Tisiphone, but Megaera intervened and insisted that Kratos belongs to her. Megaera released insects into Aegaeon's hands and mouth, mutating them into insect-titan hybrids. Kratos retrieved the Amulet of Uroboros by killing Megaera and the Hecatonchires, only for Tisiphone to create an illusion of him being honored by the King of Sparta. Kratos saw through it and, progressing further into the prison, found the Scribe of Hecatonchires, the first mortal to ever be imprisoned by the Furies. The Scribe revealed that the Furies were originally fair in their punishment, and became ruthless only under Ares' influence. Making his way to Alecto's chamber, Kratos retrieved the Oath Stone from Tisiphone's pet bird, Daimon. Upon entering the chamber, the Furies project another illusion, this time of Kratos' home in Sparta. He is nearly taken in by this, for he saw his wife and daughter again. He came close to sleeping with the image of Lysandra, but soon notices the ring on her finger, revealing her to be Alecto. She then tries to convince Kratos that he could live in this illusion forever if he rejoined Ares; however, noticing the Eyes of Truth hanging on her hip, he refused, preferring the truth to living a lie. Enraged, Alecto drops the illusion and threatens to execute him if he would not serve Ares. Kratos breaks free of her sludge trap and snatches the Eyes from Alecto, who retreated back into her sanctum before she realized they were gone. Tisiphone joined Alecto as Kratos advanced on the remaining Furies. They created an illusion of a massive whirlpool, with Alecto transforming into a horrific sea monster.  Using the Eyes, Kratos broke through the Furies' illusions and forced Alecto back into her human form. As he advanced on the Fury Queen, Tisiphone dispatched Daimon once more, but Kratos simply used the Eyes to destroy the bird. He proceeded to strike Tisiphone, shapeshifting between the forms of the King and Kratos himself, as she belittled him. As he wrapped his hands around her throat, Tisiphone transformed into the form of Lysandra, causing Kratos to briefly hesitate. Tisiphone then changed into the Village Oracle, telling Kratos that his family was not there by mere chance the night he killed them before Kratos snaps her neck. With only Alecto left, Kratos drew his blades. The Fury Queen coldly tells him that the truth would only bring him pain before he plunges his blades into her chest. With her last breath, Alecto spitefully promises that her death would change nothing. With all three of the Furies dead, Kratos returned to his home in Sparta, where Orkos congratulated him on his victory. At the same time, he also revealed that he was made the new oath keeper, thereby maintaining Kratos' bond with Ares. He begged Kratos to give him an honorable death, as it would free them both from the God, to which Kratos initially refused, proclaiming that no more innocent blood should be spilled. Orkos' continuing pleas ultimately forced Kratos' hand. With this act, Kratos experienced the first of many nightmares, previously masked by his bond to Ares: this was the price he had to pay for breaking his oath. He\u00a0also discovered his path to redemption through continual service to Olympus. Kratos proceeded to burn down his house, with the corpse of Orkos inside it.Service to the Gods  For the next decade, Kratos faithfully served the Gods of Olympus in whatever tasks they required of him. During the fifth year of his atonement, he joined the army of Attica in their struggle against the invading Persian Army and the great beast they brought forth. After a lengthy battle, Kratos killed both the Persian King and the Basilisk, before asking the gods if they wished him to do more in his servitude. At that moment, the Ghost of Sparta saw the Sun fall from the sky and vanish, leaving the world in darkness. Sensing a plot at work, Kratos followed the last remnants of light on the horizon, eventually reaching the Temple of Helios and the city of Marathon. Upon consulting with Athena, Kratos realized that Helios, the God of the Sun, had been kidnapped by an unknown force, allowing Morpheus, the God of Dreams, to put the other Olympians in a deep slumber. With the Gods of Olympus incapacitated, Kratos was tasked with finding and rescuing Helios before Morpheus could seize control of the land by covering Greece under his Black Fog. Fighting through Morpheus' minions, Kratos entered the temple of the Sun God and, after learning of the events that transpired, was tasked by Eos, the sister of Helios, to awaken her brother's Fire Steeds, which would take Kratos to where Helios was being held prisoner. Having awakened Helios' Steeds, Kratos was taken to the Underworld where he saw Helios' glowing light in the distance, right before the Pillar of the World. Kratos fought his way through Hades' domain, acquired the mighty Gauntlet of Zeus, entered Tartarus and killed Charon, the ferryman of the dead. Kratos then discovered that the Titan Atlas had somehow escaped Tartarus and captured Helios. Throughout his journey, Kratos was plagued by illusions of his daughter, Calliope, and the song she played on the flute that he once gave to her. When Kratos reached the Pillar of the World and the Temple of Persephone that lay nearby, he had already forgotten his task, thinking only of reuniting with his daughter. He encountered Persephone, the Queen of the Underworld who had been kidnapped by Hades and forced to wed him. She revealed that Kratos could be with his daughter again if he relinquished all of his powers to the Forsaken Tree. Desperate to see his daughter again, Kratos did as she asked, and she allowed him to enter the Elysium fields where he met with his daughter and was seen happy for the first time since he became the Ghost of Sparta. Persephone appeared before him, revealing that it was she who freed Atlas and asked him to capture Helios. With his help, she devised a scheme to destroy the Pillar of the World, thus killing the Gods of Olympus and all of mankind as well. She taunted Kratos with the knowledge that he may live with his daughter for a short period, but would ultimately see her die again upon the completion of her plan. Kratos then forced himself to become the Ghost of Sparta again by killing the innocent souls of Elysium and regaining his powers. Whilst giving pursuit to Persephone, he realized that he would never have the chance to be with his daughter again. As he heard her crying behind him, his hatred for the Gods of Olympus deepened. An enraged Kratos succeeded in killing Persephone and chaining Atlas to the ground above the Pillar of the World, thus completing his task. Before he left the Underworld, Atlas asked Kratos if he truly believed that the Gods would keep their promise. Kratos replied that it was the only thing he could hope for now since he could not go back to Elysium. With the use of the Fire Steeds, Kratos then escaped the Underworld, but found himself too exhausted from the journey and fell from the Chariot to the ground below. He was saved by Athena and Helios, who stripped him of his powers and equipment, leaving him unconscious upon the cliffs overlooking the Aegean Sea.The Final Task  Ten years after beginning his service to the Olympian gods, Kratos was commissioned with killing the Hydra\u00a0and bringing peace to the Aegean Sea. Along the way, Poseidon granted him the power of lightning and implored him to use it against the Hydra. After a long and vicious battle, Kratos emerged victorious by impaling the Hydra's front head on the ship's mast. Entering the decaying Hydra's throat, Kratos retrieved a boat key from the ship's Captain. For unexplained reasons, he refused to save his life and instead allowed him to plummet to his death. The Ghost of Sparta celebrated his victory that night with wine and women\u00a0but continued to suffer from nightmares of his past deeds. Distraught, he approached one of Athena's statues and asked her when he would be free from his past. She told Kratos that his final task would be to find Pandora's Box and use the power inside it to destroy Ares. Kratos, having finally been granted an opportunity for revenge against the God of War, asked Athena if the gods would take his nightmares away upon completing this task. The goddess, however, refused to provide a clear answer, and instead offered him an intentionally vague promise of forgiving his past sins. Nonetheless, Kratos interpreted this answer as a 'yes'\u00a0and set sail for Athens anyway. Arriving at the docks of Athens, Kratos made his way through the besieged city, killing countless minions of Ares in the process. Encountering Aphrodite in a nearby temple, Kratos decapitated the infamous Medusa, Queen of the Gorgons, at her behest. In return, Kratos was granted the power to freeze his enemies where they stand. He later acquired lightning bolts from Zeus as well, using them to strike down a terrified Athenian guard after he refused to lower the bridge, thereby allowing Kratos to cross. Progressing further into the city, he briefly encountered the Athenian Oracle, who was then kidnapped by a pair of Harpies before she could speak to him. Giving chase, he soon found himself outside the Oracle's temple, where he observed a gravedigger (later revealed to be Zeus) digging a grave. Kratos inquired as to who would occupy it, to which the gravedigger answered that Kratos will. The Ghost of Sparta is alarmed by this answer, but the gravedigger reassures him that \"all will be revealed in good time, and when all appears to be lost, I will be there to help\". Progressing further into the temple, Kratos finds the Oracle dangling from a nearby cliff and rescues her. She immediately suspects that Kratos is motivated by something other than a desire to do good, and looks through his memories. The Oracle is horrified by Kratos' past deeds and asks why Athena would ever call on someone like him. Kratos angrily grabs the Oracle by the throat and throws her aside, telling her to stay out of his head. The Oracle informed Kratos that Pandora's box could be found in Pandora's Temple, located just beyond the Desert of Lost Souls on the back of the Titan Cronos. She warned the Ghost of Sparta that none have ever survived Pandora's temple, but Kratos is unfazed. A statue of Athena appeared before Kratos at the desert entrance, telling him that he must follow the song of the sirens and destroy all three before he can progress further. After doing so, he finds the\u00a0Titan Horn and uses it to summon Cronos. Kratos begins to climb the Titan, arriving at Pandora's temple three days later. Just outside the temple's entrance, he notices a gatekeeper (who is revealed to be the undead spirit of the first mortal to ever attempt Pandora's temple) tending to a pyre of dead bodies. As punishment for his failure, the gods forced him to watch over the entrance for all eternity, and burn the bodies of any soul foolish enough to try and conquer Pandora's temple. Believing Kratos would fail just like all the others, he disinterestedly wishes the Ghost of Sparta good luck before opening the gates. As the Spartan made his way through the temple, he encountered both Artemis and Hades, from whom he gained the Blade of Artemis and Souls of Hades, respectively. Along the way, he defeats countless monsters (including a giant armored Minotaur), survives impossible traps, and sacrifices a caged Athenian soldier before finally reaching Pandora's box, being the first human ever to do so. However, this did not escape the notice of Ares, who responded by hurling a large broken pillar towards Pandora's Temple,\u00a0impaling Kratos. The\u00a0Harpies collected Pandora's Box and took it back to Ares, while Kratos died and fell into the Underworld. As he plummeted to the River Styx, Kratos grabbed hold of the Captain's leg and used it to climb to safety before kicking him down below into the River Styx. Reaching the top again, Kratos managed to escape the clutches of Hades via the same hole that the Gravedigger had been digging earlier. He tells Kratos that Athena is not the only god watching over him\u00a0and that he still has one final task to complete before his sins are forgiven. Journeying through the now destroyed city of Athens, he reacquires Pandora's Box from Ares and uses it to grow tremendously in size and gain a substantial amount of power in order to battle Ares on more even footing. After a vicious fight, Ares traps Kratos in a psychological void where demonic incarnations of himself attempt to kill phantom versions of his family. Kratos successfully fights them off\u00a0but watches helplessly as Ares strips him of his Blades of Chaos and used them to kill his family again. Kratos, now distraught and vulnerable, nearly met his end at the hands of Ares, but soon took notice of the Blade of the Gods and used it to finally destroy the God of War. Though his past had been forgiven, the Gods refused to relieve him of his nightmares. His last bit of hope taken from him, Kratos attempted to commit suicide by jumping from a cliff. However, Athena had a different plan for the Spartan; she saved his life and offered him the now empty throne of the God of War on Olympus. He accepted the offer, sat upon the fallen god's throne, and became the new God of War.As the God of War  Kratos entered Tartarus once again in search of the Ambrosia in order to destroy it, for the Disciples of Ares desired to use it to resurrect their now dead God. Throughout his journey, Kratos received flashbacks of his first quest for the Ambrosia. Making his way through Tartarus, Kratos encountered and defeated a giant arachnid monster. After pulling his blades out from the beast, Athena spoke to him in an attempt to warn him about new dangers on the path he took once before. Kratos shrugged off her warnings, confident that nothing would stop him.   Later, he encountered Athena again and was told by the goddess that it is now the dead he must fear. Again, Kratos ignored her warnings, proceeding to find the dead bodies of Spartan soldiers who had accompanied him on his earlier quest for the Ambrosia. Rising from the dead, they attempted to kill Kratos in retaliation for abandoning them, although he defeated them all. The island then revealed itself to be a monstrous beast named Gyges, who sought revenge against Kratos after one hundred of his arms were burned off in his battle with Helios' Champion. Kratos, however, incinerated Gyges with the Flames of Apollo, destroying the Tree of Life and all of its Ambrosia. He then left the island, knowing that the disciples of Ares would hunt him down for destroying the last hope they had at reviving their fallen God. Sometime later, Kratos experienced visions of his mother being held at the Temple of Poseidon in Atlantis. En route to Poseidon's city, Athena attempted to dissuade Kratos from his mission, but her pleas fell on deaf ears. His ship was then attacked by the Scylla. Chasing the monster off, he received another vision, this time of his childhood training with his brother Deimos.  He entered the temple and encountered his long presumed dead mother Callisto, who assured Kratos that it is really her, to his shock. She then tells him that his father had taken her there and that Deimos is still alive; trapped and tortured in the Domain of Death. Both shocked and angered, Kratos asked who his father was and why she lied to him all those years ago. Before Callisto could tell him, she is transformed into a hideous beast, forcing Kratos to fight and critically wound her. Callisto used her dying moments to thank Kratos for setting her free\u00a0and encouraged him to pursue Deimos in Sparta. Enraged over the gods having taken yet another member of his family, Kratos embarked on a journey to save his brother, defiantly ignoring Athena's orders that he turn back. At one point, Kratos encountered the Titan Thera, imprisoned inside a volcano, who told him he would be incapable of leaving if he did not free her. After forcefully imbuing the Blades of Athena in the Titan's chest, Kratos obtained Thera's Bane and left the volcano. In releasing Thera, Atlantis' fate was sealed. Upon his descent, he impaled the Scylla, who had been pursuing him relentlessly ever since his arrival, finally defeating the monster. Before returning home, Kratos found himself under attack by Erinys, Thanatos' daughter. Following Erinys' defeat, Kratos returned to Sparta, killing the Piraeus Lion and a Dissenter before entering the Temple of Ares (then in the process of being converted into the Temple of Kratos), where he would find the key to saving his brother. The Spartan then made his way back to the sinking city of Atlantis, although his route was fraught with danger as Poseidon had unleashed an enormous whirlpool at sea and attempted to blast Kratos from the sky in retaliation for the destruction of his city. Kratos survived Poseidon's assault, only to be contacted telepathically by the Sea God via one of his broken statues, warning him that he would pay for what he had done to Atlantis. Sometime later, Athena inadvertently revealed to the Spartan that it was she, along with Ares, who had taken Deimos from him that day, justifying their actions on the grounds that he was a threat to Olympus. This revelation deepened Kratos' hatred for the Gods even further. Proceeding onward, Kratos entered the Domain of Death and the Temple of Thanatos where he finally found his brother Deimos. Kratos set Deimos free, only to be attacked by him, as Deimos blamed Kratos for not helping him when in dire need. Witnessing the battle from close by, Thanatos intervened and snatched Deimos. Barely able to stand from his fight with Deimos, Kratos followed Thanatos to the Suicide Bluffs and quickly rescued Deimos from falling to his death.  After being reunited and reconciling their differences, the Spartan brothers took arms and joined forces against Thanatos. The God of Death taunted the brothers, recalling the oracle's prophecy that a \"marked warrior\"\u00a0was destined to destroy Olympus. He comments that Zeus, Ares, and Athena chose the wrong \"marked warrior\" that day: it was Kratos who should have been taken away, not Deimos. Thanatos then said that it didn't matter anymore\u00a0and that nothing Kratos does is of his own choosing. Kratos shouted that no one, not even the gods decide his fate, to which Thanatos laughed and said the gods decide, and the Sisters of Fate make it so, further commenting that Kratos was nothing but a pawn in a game that he didn't know was being played.\u00a0In a climactic battle, Thanatos took Deimos' life, only to have an enraged Kratos take his in return. Kratos then took the lifeless body of his brother to his grave.  After putting Deimos in a grave dug by the enigmatic Grave Digger, Kratos stated that his brother was now free. He once again attempted to kill himself at the bluffs, but ultimately relented, asking himself what he had become. The Grave Digger, who had been close by, prophetically answered \"Death, the Destroyer of Worlds\" before vanishing. Athena then pleaded with Kratos to forgive her, and offered to empower him to full Godhood, but saw her pleas ignored, as Kratos promised her that the Gods would pay for their actions. Kratos began to isolate himself from the other Gods and spent most of his time assisting Sparta in its conquest of Greece. During a siege on an unknown city, he was attacked by Argos, Hera's pet. Before he could defeat the beast, however, an unknown Assassin killed it in his stead, apparently trying to destroy his reputation on Olympus. Kratos pursued the Assassin\u00a0but saw his progress halted by the minions of Hades, causing him to believe that the Assassin was Hades in disguise (this notion is further supported by the fact that Hades already resented Kratos for the death of his wife Persephone). The God of War continued his pursuit, only to be stopped by Ceryx, a messenger of the Gods, who allowed the Assassin to escape. On Zeus' orders, Ceryx told Kratos to cease his pursuit. Providing no valid reason, Ceryx only managed to infuriate the God of War. Kratos killed the messenger on the spot, instantly realizing that Zeus would not stand for this action. When Kratos sent his Spartan soldiers to conquer Rhodes, Athena implored him to stop, as the other Gods grew weary of his destructive behavior. Kratos, as usual, ignored her warning and instead plunged down to the Earth, aiding his army in further destroying the city. An eagle soon appeared and robbed Kratos of his immense size and a significant chunk of his godhood powers, reducing him to the size of an ordinary human. Despite this, he retained some of his god powers, enabling him to easily defeat the warriors of Rhodes. The eagle imbued Kratos' god powers into the Colossus of Rhodes, which was then brought to life.   Kratos fought a long and arduous battle with the giant until Zeus offered help in the form of the Blade of Olympus, which he himself used to end the Titan War. Infusing the remainder of his god powers and immortality into the blade, Kratos defeated the Colossus. As he shouted to the heavens, the statue's falling hand crushed him, knocking the Blade of Olympus out of his grasp. Severely wounded, and stripped of all of his powers, Kratos knew his only hope of survival lay with the Blade. Limping towards it, the eagle soon reappeared and revealed itself to be Zeus in disguise (Kratos originally believed Athena was responsible). Zeus informed Kratos that he didn't want to suffer the same fate as Ares, and demanded that Kratos surrender and serve him forever. However, when Kratos refused, Zeus attacked and killed him by driving the Blade into his abdomen. In his dying breath, Kratos swore that Zeus would pay for his treachery.Changing His Fate  Kratos was dragged down by the arms of the Underworld. The Titan Gaia, who had been watching him his entire life, saved Kratos, sealed his wound, and gave him the strength to escape death once again. Climbing out from the Underworld, he instructed the last surviving soldier to return to Sparta and prepare for battle. Kratos then took Pegasus, a gift from Gaia, and attempted to fly back to Olympus so he could exact his revenge, but discovered that he could no longer enter Olympus, as he was no longer a God. Instead, Gaia instructed Pegasus and Kratos to seek out the Sisters of Fate. She informed him that the Sisters had the power to travel back in time, which he could use to reclaim the Blade of Olympus and take his revenge on Zeus. Kratos first traveled to Typhon's lair, where he met with Prometheus, who begged him to release him from his torment in the Fires of Olympus. Kratos, after stealing Typhon's Bane from the Titan, used it to break Prometheus' last chain, sending him down into the flames, burning him alive and finally releasing him. His ashes granted him the power of the Titans.   Kratos then made his way to the Island of Creation, where the Pegasus was attacked by a pack of Griffins. After defeating the undead soldier who led the pack of griffins, Kratos made a death defying leap off of Pegasus and onto the Island. As he continued his journey, he questioned Gaia over her reason for aiding him. Gaia then tells him the story of the Titanomachy and how the Olympians betrayed her and overthrew the Titans. Armed with this knowledge, Kratos continued his quest and soon encountered Theseus, who guarded the Steeds of Time. Theseus laughed and mocked Kratos' quest to destroy Zeus and challenged him to a fight, wanting to see who was the greatest warrior in all of Greece. Theseus was defeated after Kratos skewered him with his own spear and repeatedly slammed the door shut on his head. Kratos then used the Horse Keeper's Key to gain control of the steeds, moving the temple of the sisters of fate closer and connecting the two together.  Kratos made his way through the Bog of the Forgotten where he encountered an undead foe from his past, the Barbarian King. Having escaped Hades' torment, he traveled to the Island of Creation for two reasons: to change his fate and exact revenge on Kratos. They engaged in a fierce duel, with Alrik summoning the souls of the dead (including the Captain) with his mighty hammer. Eventually, these souls were either destroyed (again, including the Captain) or absorbed by Alrik, using them to increase his size. Ultimately, Kratos shrunk the king back down, seized Alrik's hammer and used it to crush his skull, killing him once more. Looking upon Alrik's corpse, memories of Kratos' past came back to haunt him, but he pressed on anyway. Entering Euryale's temple, he obtained the Golden Fleece from a wounded soldier (whom he then sacrificed by throwing his body under a cog, jamming it), which could deflect enemy attacks. Kratos used this weapon to defeat a nearby Cerberus and, eventually, Euryale herself. Enraged at Kratos for decapitating her sister Medusa, Euryale fought with great ferocity\u00a0but was defeated when Kratos pulled her own head off as well. With the Gorgon sister's death, Kratos used Head of Euryale to turn his enemies into stone. Progressing further, he soon came across another statue of Athena, who implored him not to trust Gaia and to cease his quest for vengeance. As usual, Kratos ignored her warnings and pressed on.   Soon afterward, Kratos encountered his half-brother Perseus, who was on a quest to save his beloved Andromeda from Hades. Perseus challenged the Ghost of Sparta to a fight, believing it would prove his worth to the Sisters of Fate and allow him to rescue Andromeda; or, if not that, would at least allow him to \"bathe in the glory of being the one to bring down the mighty Kratos\". However, Perseus was no match for Kratos, who made short work of the legendary Greek hero by breaking all of his equipment and impaling him on a large hook. Kratos then took his shield and used it to enter the Courtyard of Atropos. Reaching the Great Chasm, he was confronted by an elderly Icarus, who had by this point lost his sanity.  Icarus tries to get Kratos to stop his quest, rambling on about how it is \"MY TEST!!!\" while telling him that he would never make it across the chasm. Annoyed, Kratos tries to push him aside, but this does not deter Icarus. He continues to get in Kratos' way and yell about the futility of his quest, telling the Ghost of Sparta that \"THIS IS MY TEST\" and that only he can fly across the chasm and receive an audience with theSisters of Fate. Kratos takes hold of his throat and declares \"I will make it to the Sisters of Fate and I will use your wings to do so.\" Icarus tackles Kratos, causing them both to fall off the ledge and plummet to Underworld. Their fight continued as they fell, but ended when Kratos ripped off Icarus' Wings and drop-kicked him down in the Underworld, sealing his fate. However, Kratos managed to fly to safety by landing on Atlas. Gaia then told him that he needed to return to the surface, prompting Kratos to travel across Atlas' body and destroy part of his chains. This relieved some of the Titan's burden\u00a0but called attention to Kratos' presence. He scolded Kratos for having the nerve to show his face to him again, after what he had done. Intent on crushing the former God for his imprisonment, Atlas ultimately ceased his attempt to kill Kratos when he revealed that he was now an enemy of Zeus, and sought to change his fate in order to destroy the King of the Gods. Atlas told Kratos more about the Great War and how it ended when Zeus created the Blade of Olympus. Atlas gave Kratos some of his power and lifted him back to the surface, where he continued his journey into the Palace of Fates. There, he took two scholars hostage and forced them to read an incantation that Kratos himself could not read before ultimately sacrificing them both. Soon afterwards, he encountered the last remaining Spartan warrior, only this time shrouded in darkness. With neither of them aware of who they were facing, both warriors engaged in battle, intending to reaching the Sisters themselves. Eventually, the Last Spartan fell prey to Kratos' Blades as they tumbled out of the stained glass window into the light, revealing their identities to each other. The Spartan warrior informed Kratos of the fact that Zeus had destroyed Sparta before succumbing to his wounds, causing Kratos to be overtaken with anger and shout to the Heavens. Blinded by rage, he was then attacked by the Kraken, providing little resistance as it proceeded to strangle him. Held firm in its grasp, Kratos then saw an astral projection of his wife, which was actually Gaia in disguise, encouraging him to go on and tell him that Hades will torment him for all eternity if he dies. She told Kratos that the Titans wanted him to lead them into battle before empowering him with the Rage of the Titans. Kratos, ultimately regaining his will to live, engaged the Kraken in battle and killed it. Then, using the Phoenix, he made his way to the Sister's main stronghold. Kratos entered the Sister's throne room and met with Lahkesis, who told him that the Fates decided upon the destinies of all, and how it was she who allowed him to come as far as he did. She then proclaimed that it was not his destiny to kill Zeus. By this point, Kratos had no interest in negotiation, telling her that they no longer had any control over his destiny, ultimately threatening to kill her if she did not let him pass. This enraged Lakhesis, who then engaged the Ghost of Sparta in battle. Kratos almost immediately gained the upper hand and inflicted heavy damage on Lakhesis, infuriating her even further. She summoned her sister Atropos, who took Kratos back in time to his battle with Ares, attempting to destroy the Blade of the Gods so that his past and present self would cease to exist. Kratos subdued her before teleporting himself back to the present. Lakhesis grew ever more frustrated and engaged once more, only now with Atropos in tow. After a long and hard battle, he trapped them in both a time void and shattered it, erasing them for good. Kratos then proceeded on to Clotho, who implored him not to go forward with his manipulation of fate. Kratos, having pinned all of Clotho's lower body parts to the ground, ascended to the top platform and impaled her with one of her own instruments, instantly killing her. Kratos then took control of his own life thread in the Loom Chamber, proceeding back in time to the point where Zeus betrayed him. Once there, Kratos immediately charged at Zeus and tackled him. Shocked by Kratos' sudden reappearance, Zeus assumed that the Sisters of Fate had helped him somehow But as Kratos pulled the Blade of Olympus out of his past self, he informed Zeus that all three Sisters are dead. Zeus then commented that he had underestimated Kratos, but that he would not do so again. Both men charged at each other, engaging in a vicious battle through the skies before landing on the Summit of Sacrifice, where Zeus soon reappeared in his full God form. Zeus summoned an army of sirens to aid him while hurling lightning bolts at Kratos, only for the Ghost of Sparta to use the sirens to paralyze Zeus and plunge the Blade of Olympus into his oversized hand. Infuriated, Zeus elected to shrink back down to mortal size and engage Kratos directly. The God eventually manages to take the Blade away from Kratos, only to lose it once more as Kratos drives the blade into Zeus' abdomen and throws him against a nearby set of standing rocks. Zeus soon manages to swipe the Blade of Olympus out of Kratos' hands a second time\u00a0but loses it again when Kratos impales Zeus with the blade and throws him against another set of standing rocks. The Ghost of Sparta then ascends the structure and drops the top slab onto Zeus, greatly infuriating the God. Zeus, having had enough, reverts to his full Olympian size and unleashes a powerful lightning storm on Kratos. Yielding defeat, Kratos put down the Blade of Olympus and asked the King of Gods to release him from his torment, to which Zeus responded: \"I will release you from your life, my son, but your torment is just beginning\" before moving in to kill the Spartan. However, this is revealed to have been a trick by Kratos, who then deflected the blow, slammed Zeus' head against a nearby rock before pinning Zeus down with his Blades. Taking the Blade of Olympus back, Kratos furiously drove it into Zeus' abdomen, intending to kill Zeus in the same way he had killed Kratos in Rhodes. Athena appeared moments later and charged at Kratos, begging him to stop. Zeus then took advantage of the situation and tried to flee, but this did not escape Kratos' notice. The enraged Spartan made one final attempt on his life, only for Athena to jump in the way and take the blow herself. A distraught Kratos asked Athena why she sacrificed herself, to which she replied: \"to save Olympus\". She further revealed to Kratos that Zeus is his father and that his actions were driven by fear. Zeus' intention was to finally break the cycle of patricide by killing Kratos, whom he now recognized as the \"Marked Warrior\" destined to bring about the final destruction of Olympus. Athena begged Kratos to forfeit his quest for revenge, warning him that all of Olympus would unite against him and that should he succeed in killing Zeus, the world would be destroyed. By this point, Kratos' sanity and compassion for others had been completely drained, and he vowed to destroy all of the Gods along with anyone else who stood in his way. Traveling back in time to the Titanomachy, he brought the Titans with him to the present and led them forth to Mount Olympus to confront the Gods one last time. Meanwhile, a badly weakened Zeus calls forth a meeting of the Gods (although only Poseidon, Hades, Hermes, and Helios are present), urging them to put aside their differences and unite against their common enemy, Kratos. Moments later, Mount Olympus begins to tremble as the Gods look down in horror at the ascending Titans, who are now accompanied by Kratos. The Ghost of Sparta yells out to his father, declaring that the reign of the Olympians is now over.The Second Great War  Zeus immediately ordered his fellow Olympians, along with his demigod son Hercules, to attack Kratos and his Titan allies, although Zeus himself opted to stay out of the fray for the time being as he was still recovering from his last battle with Kratos. The Olympians initially had the upper hand, however, as Hades successfully dislodged several Titans with his claws, while Poseidon shot down from Olympus like a torpedo and struck a death blow through Epimetheus' chest, sending the Titan to his grave. Moments later, Poseidon resurfaced within a colossal watery construct in his image, spawning several Hippocampi to aid him in battle. With Poseidon as their greatest threat, having already decimated numerous Titans and now going after Gaia herself, Kratos engaged the God of the Sea in a vicious battle. Kratos freed Gaia from Poseidon's Hippocampi, allowing her to grab the Sea God and slam him into the mountain. With Poseidon pinned down, Kratos moved in to attack. The enraged Spartan pounded Poseidon with his blades, while the God tried to defend himself with his trident. Eventually, Kratos shattered the massive rock formation on Poseidon's chest, exposing his weak spot.   Poseidon broke free of Gaia's grasp by attacking her with more Hippocampi. However, the Spartan quickly broke Poseidon's hold over Gaia, allowing her to throw a devastating punch which sent Kratos on a collision course with the god of the sea, knocking him out of his watery construct and onto a nearby cliff. Kratos grabbed Poseidon and threw him against the rocks, watching as his water construct disintegrated and collapsed into the sea. As the Ghost of Sparta moved in to finish him off, Poseidon told Kratos that no matter how many gods fall, there would always be another to stand against him. Unfazed, Kratos retorted that any god who gets in his way will meet the same fate. Poseidon, realizing just how insane and vengeful Kratos has become, warned him to relent, stating that the death of Olympus would mean the end of the (Grecian) world. Kratos, again, is unfazed, and coldly responds: \"Then prepare for YOUR death, Poseidon\". Kratos then grabbe Poseidon by his neck and battered him uncontrollably, slamming his uncle's head against the rocks before throwing him against a large boulder. In desperation, a visibly terrified Poseidon attempted to crawl away and escape back into the sea, but Kratos easily caught up with him, gouged his eyes out, and snapped his neck before tossing his corpse off the mountain. With Poseidon's death, the seas unleashed a cataclysmic flood that engulfed all of Greece, drowning almost all of the Greeks, save for those on Olympia and other mountaintop locations. The Spartan climbed back onto Gaia's hand and they both continued onward to Zeus' pavilion, where the King of the Gods angrily anticipated Kratos' arrival. Gaia wrapped her palm around Zeus' platform, trapping him there as an eager Kratos jumped down from Gaia's hand to confront Zeus. The enraged Spartan taunted the King of the Gods, reminding him that with Athena's death, there was no one left to protect him. In response, Zeus told Kratos that Athena died because of his blind rage, asking him how far he was willing to go to sate his need for vengeance. Kratos then boasted that neither the Sisters of Fate nor the gates of Hades could stop him, ultimately declaring that Zeus would not live to see the next sunrise. As Kratos and Gaia prepared to attack, Zeus summoned a massive bolt of lightning which he used to knock both Kratos and Gaia off of the mountain, in the hopes they would fall into the River Styx below. The resulting blast tore off a portion of Gaia's arm, causing her to struggle to maintain her grip. Kratos urged Gaia to help him as he too was losing his grip, but the Titan refused, claiming that doing so would cause both of them to fall off the mountain. Kratos reminded her of why she saved him from death, to which Gaia replied that he was nothing more than a pawn whom they no longer needed, as the Titans had finally reached Zeus. Betrayed yet again, Kratos plummeted from the mountain and found himself stranded in the Underworld once more. Contemplating his life as he lurched through the River Styx and its caverns, he resolved to escape Hades and destroy Zeus once and for all. After being drained of nearly all of his power by the dead souls of the River Styx, he met the ghost of Athena, who claimed to have reached a \"higher existence\" and offered to help Kratos exact his revenge on Zeus. Suspicious of this turn of events, Kratos demanded to know why she had such a sudden change of heart as she died protecting Zeus. Athena then explained to Kratos how she saw truths where she did not before, and to regain his trust, she transformed Kratos' ruined blades into the Blades of Exile, which would help him survive the Underworld and the foes that awaited him. She then instructs him to find and extinguish the Flame of Olympus, claiming that it is the source of Zeus' power.   Kratos made his way through the Underworld, meeting lost souls, stealing Apollo's bow from Peirithous by burning him alive, and encountering The Judges, who decided that Kratos was not yet ready for the afterlife before urging him to proceed forward. Along the way, he would encounter a statue of Pandora, which called out to Kratos. Initially mistaking its voice for Calliope's, he soon realized that it was someone else and tried to walk away. Before he could, the voice claimed to know all about Kratos, telling him that everybody on Olympus was terrified of him, to which Kratos replied: \"there are reasons for that\". Pandora tried to tell him more, but she was interrupted by the voice of Hades, who mocked Kratos. The Spartan ordered Hades to reveal himself, only for the God of the Underworld to reply that Kratos was too impatient and that soon enough, they would have their time to play. Descending deeper into the depths of the Underworld, he encountered a despairing Hephaestus, the Craftsman of Olympus as well as the God of Volcanoes and Fire, who blamed Kratos for his exile to the Underworld as well as the disappearance of his daughter Pandora. Despite his grievances, however, Hephaestus was passive and did not attack Kratos, even offering him helpful information about the secrets of Olympus, his adopted daughter Pandora, and Zeus. Progressing further into Hades' kingdom, Kratos occasionally found mysterious notes that he silently acknowledged as being from various people in his past. He eventually found and entered Hades' Palace, using the coffin-wed body of Persephone that Hades had restored to open a pathway into a dark room where he would encounter the Lord of the Underworld himself. Once there, Hades recounted his grievances against the Ghost of Sparta, blaming him for the deaths of Athena, Poseidon, and especially his beloved queen Persephone (seemingly unaware of or indifferent to her hatred for him, and her plot to destroy the world) before telling the Spartan that he would make him suffer for all of the pain he has caused him. Emerging from the darkness, Hades tried to rip Kratos' soul out of his body and absorb it, but was unsuccessful. As the room lit up, Kratos immediately engaged the God of the Underworld, viciously tearing off and destroying chunks of his flesh before he could reacquire them and heal himself. As the battle wore on, Kratos used his blades to carve up Hades' neck in an attempt to remove his helmet, which only enraged the Underworld God further. Hades responded by tearing open a crevice in the ground, hoping to pull Kratos into the River Styx. However, Kratos intercepted Hades' claw with one of his blades, ensnaring the two weapons together and initiating a tug of war. With his other blade still free, Kratos continued to fend off Hades' attacks and damage him even more as the enraged god promised Kratos that his death would only be the beginning of his suffering. The Ghost of Sparta continued to have the upper hand, damaging Hades to the point where he could easily fire his other blade and use it to form a noose around Hades' neck. Kratos proceeded to slam his uncle's head into the roof until his helmet was finally dislodged, robbing him of his Claws and causing him to plummet into the River Styx in the process.  The Underworld God was not finished, however, drastically increasing his size and emerging from the River Styx in a last ditch effort to destroy his enemy once and for all. Using Hades' own claws against him, Kratos further weakened the God of the Underworld and attached the claws to his now exposed, damaged skull, ripping the soul right out of his body, killing him. Hades' death caused all of the souls in the Underworld to run rampant, tearing a giant hole in his abdomen which Kratos used to escape the area. Now in possession of Hades' soul, Kratos gained the ability to swim through the River Styx unharmed and use the Hyperion Gate at will. Kratos once again emerged in Hephaestus' lair. The Smith God then asked Kratos if Hades was truly dead, to which Kratos responded in the affirmative. Hephaestus laughed in approval, claiming that Hades deserved to suffer but thought his death was impossible. Imparting more information to the Ghost of Sparta, Kratos bade farewell to Hephaestus and used a Hyperion Gate to escape from the Underworld.   Back on Mount Olympus, on the outskirts of the city of Olympia, Helios rode by on his chariot and threw some fireballs at Kratos, prompting him to give chase. In the process, he encountered a struggling Gaia, who was amazed by his survival and asked Kratos to help her. Remembering Gaia's earlier betrayal, he adamantly refused to help her, instead severing her arm as she desperately asked Kratos if she meant nothing to him. The Ghost of Sparta retorted in a show of cruel irony it was, in fact, Gaia who was the pawn, his pawn while telling a pleading Gaia that the war against Zeus was \"his war\" and not hers. Kratos then destroyed the root of Gaia's hand with the Blade of Olympus, sending a screaming Gaia plummeting to her presumed death. Later, he finds Helios engaged in a battle with the Titan Perses. Using a nearby catapult, he knocked the Sun God into Perses' grasp. The Titan then crushed him in his hand and threw him across the city. The Spartan proceeded to hunt Helios down and finish him off.  He eventually found Helios, but the badly injured Sun God summoned a phalanx of shield-carrying soldiers to shelter him from Kratos' onslaught. The Spartan took control of a nearby Cyclops and used it to eliminate the phalanx completely. With no other options left, Helios tried to trick Kratos into sparing his life with a promise that he would repay him in full. Although suspicious, Kratos considered the offer and asked Helios where he could find the Flame of Olympus. Helios refused to provide a straight answer, instead warning him of the futility of his quest, to which Kratos responds \"of all the lives you should worry about Helios, mine is not one of them\". With his guard lowered, Helios attempted to blind Kratos with a beam of sunlight. Although this momentarily stunned him, Kratos blocked out the sunlight long enough to make his way back to Helios and begin stomping his head. The Sun God soon relented and told Kratos that in order to receive the Flame's power, he must step into the Flame itself. However, Kratos immediately knew that this was a lie, as Hephaestus had already told him that the Flame is lethal to both mortals and Gods alike. Helios tries in vain to dissuade Kratos from believing the Smith God, calling him a \"freak that has fallen from the graces of Olympus\", but Kratos responds that this is exactly why he believed the Smith God in the first place. Having run out of options, Helios resigned himself to his fate, although he remained defiant to the end, telling the Spartan that his death would not lead him to Zeus, to which Kratos disagrees.  The Spartan then grabbed the Sun God and pulled his head off with his bare hands, causing the sun to be permanently veiled by dark clouds and rain storms. Although Helios was now dead, his head could still emit intense sunlight, and Kratos used it as a lantern to light his way through the dark caverns of Mount Olympus. Perses attacked the Spartan on his way up the mountain (presumably to avenge Gaia), forcing Kratos to kill him. As Kratos reached the Labyrinth, he was confronted by Hermes, who joyously teased and mocked the Spartan warrior both for his past failures and the foolishness of his current vendetta against Zeus. Kratos attempted to ignore Hermes at first, believing him to be nothing more than a \"fly from the ass of Zeus\", but Hermes continued to provoke him, stating that the only reason he doesn't provide chase is because he knows he will never catch him, before speeding his way up the Chain of Balance away from Kratos. The Ghost of Sparta slowly ascended the Chain of Balance until he reached a chamber containing Pandora's Box. Surprised to see the box, Athena soon appeared and told him that there is a dormant, unused power inside that he will need to defeat Zeus, although the box was inaccessible due to it being sealed off and engulfed by the Flame of Olympus. Athena further explained that in order to quell the Flame, he would need the box's namesake, Pandora herself. Hermes reappeared the moment Athena departed\u00a0and provoked Kratos into chasing him. Along the way, Hermes childishly mocked and belittled Kratos for his lack of speed and his perceived stupidity. Although he was reasonably successful in providing chase, Hermes soon found a narrow chain leading to the head of a large statue which Kratos could reach. Hermes sped across the large chasm and made his way to the top of the statue, telling Kratos to \"keep up\". Greatly underestimating the mortal, Hermes was soon knocked from his perch and severely weakened after Kratos used a nearby catapult to destroy the statue. He also used his blades to attach himself to the catapult fodder, using it to close in on Hermes.  After the statue collapsed, Kratos noticed a leftover blood trail and used it to corner a now defenseless Hermes. The Spartan made short work of the Speed God, who then bitterly insulted him for his lack of honor and the terrible things he has done. Kratos then grabbed Hermes and sliced off one of his legs, watching as the humiliated God attempted to squirm away before slowly approaching him and brutally cutting off his half-brother's other leg. The loss of both of Hermes' legs resulted in his death\u00a0and caused a deadly plague to spread across the land, affecting all human, animal, and plant life. Kratos took Hermes' boots, using them to traverse wide chasms and proceed further into the halls of Olympus.  Eventually arriving in an empty forum, Kratos encountered a drunken Hera, who ordered his half-brother Hercules to destroy him as she watched from above. Hercules expressed resentment towards Kratos, claiming that Zeus had always favored him before stating his desire to kill Kratos (calling it his 13th and final labor) and claim the God of War throne for himself. Kratos told Hercules that his aspirations are a waste of time since the reign of Olympus is coming to an end. Hercules replied \"we will see about that\" before ordering his legions to attack Kratos. Easily besting his undead warriors, Hercules himself joined the fray, using the Cestus he acquired from his conquest of the Nemean Lion to fight Kratos while ordering his legions to swarm him, allowing Hercules a clean hit. After a long and brutal fight, Kratos grabbed Hercules and carried him to the beds of spikes lining the forum walls, throwing him into them and tearing off all of his armor. This only served to provoke Hercules, who then killed all of his legions with an earthquake punch and engaged Kratos one on one. As the fight went on, Hercules grew increasingly impatient and clanged both of his Cestus together, temporarily stunning Kratos. Hercules took this opportunity to brag to Hera about his impending victory, only for Kratos to attack him from behind and take Cestus away from him. Now with no weapons, Hercules tried to best his half-brother using his bare hands and legendary strength, hurling portions of the forum wall at Kratos and eventually lifting the floor out from underneath him in the hopes of causing the Ghost of Sparta to fall to his death. Kratos used the Cestus to climb back up onto the platform before punching it back down on top of Hercules, trapping him underneath. Kratos proceeded to beat his half-brother to death with the Cestus, mutilating and completely destroying his face until the floor beneath them broke, causing them both to plummet to the sewers underground. Later, he encountered a radiant Aphrodite and her handmaidens in the goddess' chamber. Aphrodite did not seem to care about Kratos' war on Olympus and asked the Spartan to have sex with her. After some initial hesitation, Kratos indulged Aphrodite before using the nearby Hyperion Gate to visit Hephaestus, who sarcastically asked Kratos if his wife \"had conquered another God of War\". Kratos did not answer his question, telling him that it is a matter between Hephaestus and his wife, before questioning the Smith God on the whereabouts of Pandora. Hephaestus, knowing full well what Kratos intends to do with Pandora, demanded that he stay away from her, telling him that it's his fault that she is imprisoned in the Labyrinth and the reason that Hephaestus was exiled to Hades. Kratos insists that he has never wronged Hephaestus, but the Smith God tells him that by opening Pandora's box in his quest to destroy Ares, Zeus became infected with Fear and surmised that Hephaestus was hiding something from him. Zeus tortured the Smith God until he confessed to the creation of Pandora, a key to the box which had taken on a life of its own, with Hephaestus loving her as if she was his own daughter. Zeus took Pandora away from him and banished Hephaestus to Hades. Seemingly unmoved, Kratos insisted that he will stop at nothing to obtain his revenge. Hephaestus then decided that the only way to stop Kratos would be to send him on a suicide mission. To this end, he asked Kratos to retrieve the Omphalos stone (unbeknownst to Kratos, it was contained in the belly of the Titan Cronos), promising to make him a special weapon with it.   Having journeyed through Tartarus, he found the severed hand of Gaia resting in the palm of Cronos, who immediately accused Kratos of murdering Gaia. Blaming him for the torment he now suffers in Tartarus (Zeus banished Cronos thereafter Kratos conquered the Temple of Pandora), Cronos attempted to kill the Ghost of Sparta. Initially attempting to crush Kratos between his fingers, the Spartan used Helios' head to temporarily blind Cronos and escape death. Landing on Cronos' arm, he went unnoticed by the Titan until he scaled his arm and destroys a massive pimple. Cronos made several more attempts to flatten Kratos with his hand, only to have one of his fingernails dislodged, causing great pain to the Titan. After scaling Cronos' hand, Kratos once again blinded the Titan before making his way to the belt that kept Pandora's Temple chained to his back. Kratos opened the belt and attempted to remove the crystal nail holding Pandora's Temple in place before Cronos grabbed him and attempted to smash Kratos between his palms. Kratos survived, however, by plunging the Blade of Olympus into one of his palms, eventually making his way to Cronos' shoulder joint. After using a skinless Cyclops to damage Cronos further, the Titan decided to eat Kratos, who then took the Omphalos stone from his stomach and used the Blade of Olympus to escape, spilling the Titan's entrails in the process. Cronos begged the Spartan to leave, as he now had what he came for.  However, Kratos ignored his pleas and once again made his way to Cronos' belt, dislodging the nail and driving it into Cronos' chin. Now in tremendous pain, Cronos called Kratos a \"coward\" who \"murders his own kin\". Kratos then stabbed his grandfather in the forehead with a completely charged Blade of Olympus, killing him. The corpse of Cronos collapsed just above Hephaestus' lair, and Kratos angrily accused the Smith God of sending him on a suicide mission. Hephaestus pleaded innocence, claiming that he knew Kratos could handle himself, before taking the Omphalos stone and forging the Nemesis Whip. Hephaestus then tried to electrocute Kratos with his Ring in a final attempt to kill him, shouting \"Here is your retribution!\". Kratos managed to shake off the effect and kill Hephaestus by impaling him on his own anvil. In his dying words, the Smith God begged Kratos to spare his daughter, as well as begging for Pandora's forgiveness, after which he passed away. However, Kratos appeared to bear no ill will towards Hephaestus as he knew the sentiment behind his betrayal, as he later told Pandora that Hephaestus had done what any father should: protecting the life of his child. Using the Nemesis Whip to make his way through the Gardens of Olympus, he encountered a depressed and drunken Hera once more. Blaming Kratos for the deterioration of her garden along with all other forms of life on Earth, she ineffectually struck him but was easily pushed aside. She then taunted Kratos by telling him that his simple mind would never find a way out of the garden, although he eventually did. Deeper into the garden, Kratos encountered Hera one more time, and she continued to express her hatred for him because of what he was doing to the planet. Kratos tried to ignore her and continue on until she called Pandora a \"little whore\", causing him to choke her and brutally snap Hera's neck. Her death caused all plant life to wither and die.  Kratos returned to the Labyrinth and met an imprisoned Daedalus, who was the Labyrinth's main architect. Zeus promised him that he would have his son Icarus back once he completed the Labyrinth, but instead imprisoned him in one of the Labyrinth's traps. Nevertheless, Daedalus continued to delude himself into believing that Icarus was still alive and that Zeus would come through. His hopes were ultimately crushed when Kratos revealed that Icarus was dead (although the Spartan neglected to mention that he was the one who killed him by ripping off his wings and allowing him to fall into Hades), causing Daedalus to sob uncontrollably. Soon afterward, and despite Daedalus' pleas, Kratos pulled a lever in order to progress, ultimately setting off a trap that killed the poor inventor. Moments later, he rescued Pandora from the Labyrinth and took her with him. Initially believing her to be nothing more than an object, she reminded Kratos so much of his daughter that he grew to care for her as his own child. With Pandora in his possession, he had one final task ahead of him: neutralize the Three Judges. To this end, he travels back to the (now completely abandoned) Underworld and severed the Chain of Balance, destroying the Three Judges in the process. Making his way back up to the Flame's chamber, he raised the Labyrinth so that Pandora's box could be accessed. At this point, Kratos began to have second thoughts and refused to let Pandora sacrifice her life. Pandora resisted, telling Kratos that she did not want to be treated as a child and that she needed to embrace her destiny, only to be interrupted and apprehended by Zeus himself. Kratos ordered Zeus to let go of Pandora, only for the King of the Gods to refuse and berate him over his apparent obsession with Pandora, referring to her as an \"object\". Zeus told Kratos that he should not confuse Pandora with his own flesh and blood, but mused that he already had. He cited the destruction of Olympus and the world as proof of Kratos' need for atonement before expressing absolute horror at his son's actions, telling him to look around at what he has done. Kratos, in turn, snarled that he only saw what he had come to destroy. Zeus then expressed regret over taking pity on Kratos, calling it the \"greatest mistake\" he had ever made, before telling Kratos that taking pity on Pandora would be his greatest mistake. Kratos angrily insisted that it had nothing to do with her, with Zeus replying that it had everything to do with her. The increasingly agitated Spartan once again ordered Zeus to put her down, to which he responds by callously tossing her aside. Father and son engaged in battle once more as Olympus continued to crumble around them. Meanwhile, Pandora tried to run into the Flame, intent on pacifying it, although Kratos attempted to stop her. However, Zeus inadvertently provoked Kratos into letting her go by stating that he should not fail her like he failed his family, causing Kratos to attack Zeus in a fit of extreme rage. Kratos then opened the Box once again, only to discover that it was empty. Zeus then mocked him for \"another stunning failure\" and went outside to recover, while Kratos' fury boiled even further. Outside, father and son met again on the pavilion. Zeus, overlooking the destruction his son caused, mused that he would have a lot of work to do after defeating Kratos, who urged his father to face him in combat, stating \"it is time to end this\", to which Zeus agrees. But before either could claim victory, the platform suddenly began to tremble as a reawakened Gaia grabbed hold of the pavilion. Kratos expressed shock at her survival, only for Gaia to blame the Ghost of Sparta for the destruction of her planet (not realizing that Kratos and Gaia shared the same goal of destroying the gods, and that the destruction he caused would have happened anyway). She attempted to crush the pavilion between her hands, declaring that father and son would die together. Seeing no other exit, Zeus and Kratos were forced to enter the wound on Gaia's chest (still present from her battle with Poseidon) and dueled near\u00a0Gaia's heart, sucking the life out of it. Kratos managed to kill both Zeus and Gaia by simultaneously impaling both with the Blade of Olympus. Awakening amidst the cracked earth, Kratos tried to leave, but Zeus' still active spirit, consumed by some lasting hatred for his infidel son and empowered by Fear, attacked Kratos, draining him of his willpower and anger, and instead of filling him with fear and loss, bringing him to the verge of death. Trapped inside his own mind and tortured by his memories, Kratos was aided by the spirit of Pandora, who helped him abolish the various torments of his soul. With her help, Kratos finally forgave himself for killing his family and Athena before he\u00a0dove into The Pool of Blood and confronted his inner demons in the form of his slain victims. Overcoming these hurdles with the power\u00a0Hope, Kratos returned to the physical world and with a stronger resolve, he managed to free himself from Zeus' choking grip. He then furiously attacked Zeus' spirit, ultimately forcing it back into his own body, temporarily resurrecting a weakened Zeus. Kratos then realized that Zeus was now so weak that he no longer needed the Blades to kill him. The Spartan cast his weapons aside and charged at Zeus, who attempted to hold Kratos back. However, he easily broke through Zeus' defenses and slammed him against a rock, causing black smoke (presumably Fear) to escape from Zeus' mouth. Kratos then furiously beat Zeus to death with his bare hands, thus finally fulfilling his goals of revenge and signifying the end of the Olympians' reign once and for all. The chains around Kratos' arms loosened as Zeus' body exploded, plunging the world into complete chaos. With the reign of Olympus now over, Kratos looked out over the horizon and finally came to realize just what he had done. Arriving to congratulate Kratos, Athena asked him to turn over the power he claimed from Pandora's Box, stating that mankind was now ready to hear her message. Kratos responded that the world now stands in ruin, and therefore whatever message she has is now useless. Athena once again told him to give her what he found in Pandora's box, only for Kratos to tell her that the box was empty. However, Athena saw the power in his eyes and told him that she was the one who put the powers of Hope inside the box. Kratos reflected that Pandora had died in vain, only to serve his need for vengeance. He was consumed with grief over her death, as well as the death of the world around him.   Athena ordered Kratos to return the power he had obtained, as she believed it rightfully belonged to her. For now that the world was cleansed by chaos, she would rebuild it under her rule, using the power of hope. She then quickly came to realize, however, that when Kratos first opened the box to kill Ares, the evils were released and infected the gods of Olympus, whereas she initially believed that all of the evils went into Kratos. As the evils took hold of the gods, the power of hope instead infused itself into Kratos. Buried underneath all of the years of guilt, anger, and need for revenge, Hope was finally released when Kratos learned to forgive his past deeds, thus releasing its power. Kratos, wracked with guilt over the world's destruction and realizing that he had nowhere else to go and nothing left to live for, committed suicide by impaling himself with the Blade of Olympus. As a result, the power of Hope was inadvertently released into the mortal world, angering Athena. The Goddess told him how disappointed she is, to which he merely responded with a tiny smirk and a faint laugh. She then pulled the Blade out of Kratos' body and disappeared, leaving a heavily breathing Kratos to die. The wounded Spartan then laid himself down, laughing softly as he lowered his head down the ground, and slept in a pool of his own blood, his breathing echoing throughout the end, seemingly ready in letting death grab his soul.  However, in a post-credits scene, the eagle-engraved mural where Kratos died is shown deserted, with a trail of blood leading off the cliff. The Ghost of Sparta, having somehow survived, discovered that he is cursed to walk the Earth forever as punishment for his terrible deeds. Seeing no reason to remain in Greece, he picked up his lost Blades of Chaos and traveled north, hoping to leave the wreckage of his past behind him.A New Beginning  Several years after the destruction of Olympus, Kratos lives a secluded life in a remote forest of Norway, the realm of the Norse gods. It is revealed that the chaos caused by Kratos only destroyed Greece instead\u00a0of the entire world, and different mythologies are separated geographically. He eventually met Faye, his future second wife, while trying to retrieve the Leviathan Axe in a nearby forest. They soon gave birth to a son named Atreus, although Faye initially wanted to name him Loki. The boy was raised mainly by Faye, who taught him how to hunt and how to read the Nordic language, among other things. Per Faye's request, Kratos never took Atreus hunting since the boy was constantly sick. In an effort to practice control, Kratos would often \"test\" himself by venturing into the woods in search of enemies. While Faye thought Kratos was looking to pick fights, Kratos was actually seeking to control his rage by not fighting and only defending and deflecting attacks until his enemies tire themselves out. It is implied he failed repeatedly until,\u00a0in one instance, he encountered wolves and succeeded in fending them off. However, trolls appeared and were able to push Kratos to the point he lost control and he slaughtered the trolls with ease, causing Kratos great anger with himself. Kratos would continue to \"test\" himself, resulting in Kratos not being home very often. This led Atreus to believe Kratos does not care about him or Faye. Kratos rarely instructed Atreus to perform any chores since he was always away and did not know how healthy Atreus was. Instead, he reinforced Faye's instructions such as when Faye told Atreus to cut some firewood, Kratos (after forcing it out of Atreus) enforced the decision and told Atreus to\u00a0pull his weight.The Journey The Marked Trees  A couple of years later, Faye died for unexplained reasons and requested that her family take her cremated ashes to the highest peak in the Nine Realms. She also wished that Kratos would take her place in raising their son, although he did not believe he could do it without her. Before their journey began, Kratos cut down all of the trees around their home that were marked with Faye's yellow handprint which had, unbeknownst to Kratos, sheltered them from the wrath of the Norse gods. This was for Atreus to venture into the dangerous land of the Norse gods with his father's support. Kratos wanted to be sure that his son was ready for the long adventure waiting for them, so he tested him in hunting a deer. With a few mistakes, Atreus did manage to prove himself, but they were intercepted by an aggressive troll. While the two survived the attack, Atreus would show his aggressive tendencies by continuing to stab the already dead troll, with Kratos determining him not to be ready. As they went back to their house, a stranger suddenly knocked on their door, demanding that Kratos show himself. The strange man would then demand him for answers\u00a0while taunting him of his past, something he did not anticipate. The argument would then spawn an aggressive fight, with the stranger showing unexpected great power. But Kratos would be the supposed victor when he snapped the man's neck after an exhausting battle. Knowing that the dangers of the outside world will inevitably come, Kratos changed his mind and he and Atreus began their journey.Path to the Mountain  During their trip to the highest mountain, they met a dwarf named Brok, who mentions that he and his brother are the forgers of the axe that Kratos possesses. The dwarf offers improvements to the axe as well as other weapons, armor, and equipment the two carry.  Atreus found tracks of a boar, deciding to hunt again. When he did wound the creature, the boy chased after it. Kratos and Atreus would then travel into another realm in the process, where they found the boar heavily injured and under the care of a mysterious woman. The woman, going by the Witch, brought them back to her home to heal the boar. While she sent Atreus to gather some supplies, she told Kratos in secret about his godly heritage, knowing that his son is unaware of his father's and his own true nature. And she warns the former god the danger he has put the two in as the Norse gods will be very hostile towards them as a result. The Witch proceeded to open a portal leading them to their destination, wishing them luck on the way out. As they made their way to the Lake of Nine, they found a rune saying, \"Sacrifice your arms to the centre of the water, awaken again the cradle of the world\". Kratos decided to the throw his Leviathan Axe to the lake as it said. While it initially did nothing, the lake would soon create heavy drifts and waves. There the two encountered J\u00f6rmungandr, the World Serpent. As the serpent begins to slumber again, Kratos and Atreus realize that its awakening had dropped the lake's water, bringing them closer towards more concise destinations. They find a large mechanism with a bridge attached to it named Tyr's Temple and decided to look around, also finding Brok again, who happens to set up shop in the massive area. Exploring once more, they meet Sindri, Brok's brother and owner of the other half of the two's brand, who was curious as to why Kratos is in possession of the Leviathan Axe as it was created specifically for Faye. Atreus explains how the mother had already passed away and decides to help the two in creating improvements to their armor and weaponry, like Brok. They travel closer to the peak of the mountain afterward, albeit while intercepting some enemies like an Ogre. Kratos and Atreus find themselves halted when there appears to be Black Breath blocking their way up the mountain. The Witch unexpectedly shows up in front of the two again, explaining how the only way to cast it away is by using the Light of Alfheim. She then takes them back to Tyr's Temple, commanding Kratos to have the contraption functioning again. There she takes them to the Realm Travel Room, the only place in all the nine realms one can use to travel between said realms. Using a Bifrost, they move the temple's bridge platform to the Alfheim gate, transporting them to Alfheim.The Light of Alfheim  As they arrive, the Witch for reasons unknown seems to have herself being pulled out of the realm, but not before telling Kratos to use the Bifrost to obtain the Light. Continuing on, Atreus notices how the realm is in constant warfare between the Dark Elves and the Light Elves. As the duo make their way across Alfheim the Dark Elves and their leader Svart\u00e1lj\u01ebfurr try to kill Kratos and Atreus they both fight their way through countless members of Dark Elves and they make it to the central chamber. After they arrive at the central chamber Kratos gives the axe to Atreus and he absorbs the Light of Alfheim into the Bifrost but while he's inside the light Kratos follows Faye's ashes and he listens to how Atreus resents him for not being a loving father and he arrives in J\u00f6tunheim and he's see's Faye and before he could reach her Kratos is then pulled out of the light by Atreus. Kratos then angrily scolds Atreus and he's then shocked about how long he's been in the light and Kratos the infuses the Talon Bow with Light of Alfheim and with the newfound power the duo kill the Dark Elve King and the light goes back to the Light Elves. While heading back to Tyr's Temple, Atreus angrily accuses Kratos of not loving Faye before Kratos and Atreus argue until they both reconcile.Inside the Mountain  After returning to Midgard the duo make their back to the mountain and the dispel the black breath and they enter the mountain and they defeat more creatures and they both bond more as father and son. Son after the duo make their way to the top of the mountain where they find out that Sindri was being attacked by Hr\u00e6zlyr, a dragon living in the mountain. Kratos kills the dragon with the help of Atreus and the grateful Sindri gives Atreus branded mistletoe arrows and he infuses Lighting into the Talon Bow and they use\u00a0the arrows to get to the top of the mountain. Kratos and Atreus overhear the mysterious man who attacked their house earlier is revealed to be the god Baldur along with two men who are talking to a man trapped in a tree. The trio leave and the duo learn that the man in the tree is Mimir and they soon discover that Faye's ashes were meant to be scattered in J\u00f6tunheim and Mimir tells Kratos to cut off his head with the duo then return to the Witches' woods and they both help her revive Mimir's head who reveals the witch to be Freya, ruler of Vanir gods and Odin's wife. Kratos gets angry with her for not telling him about her true identity and they leave without thanking her. Kratos and Atreus make their way back to the Lake of Nine when Mimir tells them to\u00a0go to the horn Kratos and Atreus encountered earlier, Kratos holds Mimir's head to the horn, blowing into it, calling the World Serpent, in which the serpent devours the statue of Thor next to the Muspelheim gate, Mimir speaks in the giants language to see if he recognizes him, of that he remembers, until he mistook Kratos and Atreus of being friends of Thor until Mimir assures him that they are no friends of Thor and had never spoken the giants tongue sober. After the conversation, the serpent realigns the bridge during which they need the Thamur's chisel. While on their way to Thamur's corpse, Mimir tells the story of Odin and Freya's marriage in order to bring peace between the Aesir and Vanir gods. After Odin's first love: the giantess Fj\u00f6rgyn and mother to Thor died, Odin felt heartbroken until Freya agreed to marry Odin not only because of her fertile beauty\u00a0but her expanded knowledge in Vanir magic, in which Odin felt intrigued in learning, something that Freya regretted when Odin's obsession with Jotunheim got in the way again as well as the story of Thamur. \u00a0 Kratos, Atreus, and Mimir make it to the dead Stone Masons body. But Mimir tells them that they will have to climb up to his hammer and smash the ice, as their weapons nor Thor's hammer can demolish it. Kratos and Atreus climb up to the hammer and detach the chains allowing the hammer to fall and smash the almost impenetrable ice. After defeating more enemies, the trio overhears voices of the demigods Modi and Magni. They're just about to retrieve part of his chisel when Magni appears who was battling an ogre, snapping his neck, until he notices the duo. Magni tells them to surrender, but Kratos refuses, to which Magni draws his weapon and prepare himself for battle. Kratos tells Atreus to flee as he will most likely get killed. But Modi appears and a fight ensues. The gods use the snow-blind to gain the advantage, during which Kratos asks of why do they hunt them and what does Odin want. Magni replies he doesn't know and he doesn't care, Modi decides to taunt Atreus mostly referring to his deceased mother in order for him to lose control of his actions. Despite the taunts, Atreus manages to stay calm with his father's words. While Magni distracts Kratos, Modi taunts the boy again this time causing the boy to lose control and charge wildly against the god. Kratos breaks his defense and kills Magni causing Modi to back away from Kratos in fear and cowardice. Atreus, still angered over the insults recklessly shoots arrows at him before showing early signs of sickness again.The Sickness  Kratos and Atreus journey back over to Tyr's Temple to retrieve the Black Rune and they're about to activate the sandbowl when Modi ambushes the duo pinning Kratos down under lightning. He says that he'll only earn his father's hammer cause Magni's dead and he said that he'll be a joke as he lived under his brother's shadow for most of his life. Atreus tells him to stop, only for Modi to spur another insult about Faye, causing the boy to charge at him, only for Modi to knock him aside and continue electrocuting his father. Atreus shrugs off the attack and says he doesn't know anything about his mother, Modi says that he'll be his new brother and will get to know him real soon, right after he finishes killing Kratos. This causes Atreus to activate his Spartan Rage for the first time, before collapsing. Upon seeing his son, Kratos struggles to get up and activate his Spartan Rage with a frightened Modi to walk back in terror. Kratos disarms Modi before knocking him into a wall with Modi running away in terror crying. Mimir suggests that Kratos takes Atreus back to Freya for help. As they enter the Witch's cave, an unknown person blows into the horn to call the World Serpent. At first, Freya refuses to help Kratos due to his resentment towards deities, but when Kratos tells her the situation, Freya changes her mind and lets them in. Freya tells Kratos that this is no ordinary illness because of his son's true nature lying within him. To cure then illness, Freya instructs Kratos to retrieve the Bridgekeeper's Heart in Helheim, but not after telling him that his Leviathan axe will be useless as the enemies there will be immune to frost as well as warning him that to never travel on the Bridge of the Dead as it is a one-way ticket into Helheim. Freya ensures Kratos that the boy is not his past, but his son\u00a0and that he needs his father and she gives him the travel rune to Helheim. Kratos rushes home via boat to retrieve his Blades of Chaos while being goaded and taunted by Athena about his past that he'll always and forever, will be, a monster. While Kratos is aware of this, he tells Athena that he is no longer her monster. Kratos journeys over to Tyr's temple to activate the travel room to Helheim where Mimir tells him that no one, not even the gods can survive the cold in Helheim, and notices that Helheim is too overpopulated as the worthy are supposed to go into Valhalla. Kratos eventually reaches the bridge where Mimir suggest he cause trouble as he is very good at it, he steps into the light where the troll notices him and the two have an intense fight with the troll gaining an upper hand when Kratos manages to kill the beast and retrieve his heart. Just as Kratos was about to leave, he encounters an illusion of Zeus. Mimir is surprised that Zeus was his father. Confused, Kratos asks Mimir on how he is here. Mimir reminds to never go beyond the bridge.  As Kratos journeys back to Midgard, Mimir pieces the relationship Kratos had with Athena, his fire blades, Zeus being his father, and the ash-white skin, he realizes he is hanging on the hip by none other than the Ghost of Sparta himself. Kratos coldly tells him to not call him that, with Mimir saying that the Greek pantheon had it coming to them. Mimir also tells Kratos to tell Atreus of his godly heritage, but Kratos refuses to do so, with Mimir stating that Atreus will eventually have to be told his true nature will be revealed soon, but Kratos drops the subject.The Truth  Back in Midgard, Kratos returns to Freya's stronghold where Freya too had a son, and that he disappeared many years ago and vows herself to learn from her past mistakes with Kratos concluding that he must know the truth. Atreus recovers successfully and continues on the\u00a0journey. As they are about to leave the grotto, Kratos notices Atreus acting quiet, and knows that he overheard his talk with Freya, he tells his father that he said he was cursed, he thought that he was weak because he wasn't like his father, and along the journey, everything was different for him. Kratos tells him he doesn't know everything, Atreus is aware of this, but knows the truth. Kratos instead tells him that he's a god from another land far away, when he came to Norway, he chose to live as a man, but the truth is that he was born a deity, as well as Atreus. Atreus asks his father if he can turn into an animal, but Kratos assures him that he can't as he does not know of his future god-like powers. Atreus is excited that he is a god and asks his father if Faye was a god as well. Kratos tells his son, that she was mortal, but was aware of his true nature. When the boy asks of why his father waited so long to tell him, Kratos comforts Atreus saying that he hoped to spare him, that being a god can be a lifetime of anguish and tragedy, which is the curse. Atreus, however, doesn't feel like a god, but in time, both father and son will learn. Atreus is still unsure if he could turn into a wolf, but Kratos is welcome to be surprised, Mimir adds that every god is unique such as a faculty for languages especially for one so young.  They return to Tyr's Temple and activate the sandbowl which lowers then down to Tyr's Vault. After getting past the first trap, Kratos and Atreus discover a room where they encounter many traps and relics Tyr has collected from many different lands, including Greece. Kratos notices a vase with leftover Lemnian wine from the Greek island of Lemnos, as well as a terracotta vase with him on it. Upon lowering the Black Rune, Kratos gets caught in a trap in which he tells Atreus to match the puzzles on the wall to match them, but this didn't stop at all as the floor started lifting them up to a ceiling of spikes, to which Atreus sacrifices his mother's knife to break the chain. As they are about to retrieve the Black Rune, Kratos gives Atreus a second knife, from which he told them that he crafted it with a mix of metals from his homeland and Norse metals and that the power of warrior comes from within, but only when tempered by emotions, as being a god has a greater responsibility. As they are leaving, Kratos gives Atreus a drink of the wine from the vase he took earlier before drinking some himself explaining the origins of the wine. Over time, Atreus starts to become arrogant and cocky after learning of his godhood which deeply concerns Kratos. Mimir asks Atreus if he's ready to see J\u00f6tunheim, Atreus adds that while he's excited, he's sad that the journey is almost over. Sindri quickly catches their attention. Kratos coldly tells Atreus not to tell him about their quest and that he's a god and that it's a personal quest, to which the dwarf adds that he knows a thing or two about family matters. Atreus, whines about the fact that Sindri talks about Brok all the time and how Brok is better than he is. So he tells Sindri to stop talking about it out of spite, leaving the dwarf hurt. When Kratos asks his son of the way he spoke to the dwarf, Atreus explains that he's fed up of all the talk about him and his brother. Kratos agrees, that while they are annoying, there was no need to make him an enemy and that it was unnecessary and unkind, to which Atreus scoffs at when he said that his mother wasn't a god when Kratos said that Faye would disagree, to which later, Atreus asks if he could carry his mothers ashes, to which Kratos refuses due to speaking ill of her, and reminding him that he will not dishonor her. After entering the mountain, they once again encounter Modi, who's been beaten mercilessly into a bloody pulp by his father, saying that his father blamed him for leaving Magni to die. Atreus, threatens him to back off, or he'll pick up where his father left off. modi tries to attack, but is too injured to do so, Atreus looks back at his father, in which he answers that Modi isn't worth killing due to his battered state. Atreus said that he should take back for all the insults Modi said about his mother. Kratos refuses to let him kill the god, but Atreus reminds him that they're gods and they can do whatever they want, in which Modi spurs one last insult about Faye, before being stabbed in the neck. Kratos tries to restrain him, but it falls on deaf ears, which Atreus says that his knife, is much better than his mother's, before kicking Modi down a ravine. Kratos reprimands him that his recklessness and arrogant nature will make him a target, reminding him that he taught him to kill, but only in defense of himself, never as an excuse. When Atreus asks what's the difference, Kratos tells him that there are consequences of killing gods. Atreus yells of how he knows such a thing, Kratos warns him to watch his attitude.Back in Helheim  After reaching the summit, Kratos activates the portal to J\u00f6tunheim with the newly acquired chisel and are about to enter when Baldur ambushes the duo with him gaining the upper hand. Kratos tells his son to cross the bridge, but Atreus ignores his father's orders and shoots Baldur several times before being knocked aside. Baldur explains that the boy\u00a0has the brains now with Kratos being a nuisance. Kratos manages to block Baldur's attack and knock him into the portal, causing it to collapse. Kratos tells his son to leave, with Baldur agreeing he'd do the same. Atreus charges at the god, but Kratos restrains him saying he's not ready, in which Atreus responds by shoving his father away and shooting him with one of his arrows. He charges at Baldur again\u00a0and stabs him in the shoulder, but Baldur, being invincible shrugs off the attack and drives the knife into Atreus before taking him with him. Kratos follows behind and lands on Baldur's dragon. After a brief scuffle, Baldur manages to knock Kratos off, with Kratos landing safely onto the temple bridge. Kratos runs towards the temple with Brok asking of who activated the bridge. Kratos catches up to Baldur, saying that the portal is locked into Asgard, and it'll be over for him when the entire weight of as Asgard will descend upon him. Kratos knocks Baldur aside and instead locks in Helheim. Kratos, Atreus, and Baldur fall into Helheim getting sucked in far that they fly over the Bridge of the Damned. Kratos angrily scolds his son and manages him to keep him in line again. They start their journey back to Midgard with Mimir saying that the boat is the only way back and will take them halfway back to the Temple bridge. As they journey back, they encounter Baldur once again, but this time, he encounters a flashback to when he first got his power of invulnerability. It's also revealed that his mother is none other than Freya herself. Freya cast a spell on him to prevent him from dying, however, this also made Baldur not feel anything, from food, temperature, women, etc. Baldur tearfully regrets not killing Freya and is left to mourn. Kratos and Atreus eventually make it to the boat where they set sail back to the temple bridge. But the boat gets stuck halfway across so Kratos finally lets Atreus help him get it unstuck. Mimir says that even though they will make it back to Midgard in one piece, he tells them that there's no other way to J\u00f6tunheim. As they get near the bridge, both father and son notice Zeus before they encounter a younger version of Kratos killing Zeus. Atreus tells him to focus as the boat is near the bridge and about to collapse because of the fires surrounding it had caused the boat to burn. After crash landing in the Realm Travel Room, they find the missing panel about Tyr traveling, to other lands including Greece. Mimir then realizes that there's another way to J\u00f6tunheim by making a key and the secret to unveiling the missing J\u00f6tunheim gate as Odin never gave up hope. On their way back to Midgard, Kratos asks Mimir of Baldur's vulnerability, Mimir says that there's none at all, as he's invulnerable to threats: physical or magical. All three realize that Mimir was bewitched, during the reanimating process, Freya bewitched Mimir so that he wouldn't tell the duo that mistletoe is the key to Baldur's invulnerability. After showing Brok the picture of making the key, he refuses to do so, as he tends to make weapons of war, not tools. Sindri shows up and the brothers reconcile and together, they make a\u00a0key for them. When Atreus asks\u00a0why the rune looks different, Sindri explains that it had to be reforged.Tyr's Secret and The Truth Revealed  Going down to the lower part of the temple, Kratos activates the door beneath the travel room where they find that the travel stone to J\u00f6tunheim is on the floor, but realize the room is upside down and could be flipped. After avoiding many traps and fighting enemies, they manage to break the chains holding the temple in place and Kratos was able to flip the temple\u00a0and manages to recover the travel stone. Mimir explains that Tyr used the travel rune to follow his own path, hence why he was able to travel to other lands, in the realm between realms. After making it into the void, the travel stone embeds the duo with protection as Kratos leaps into the void. After landing without any side effects, Atreus notices the missing J\u00f6tunheim tower was in the realm between realms all long. They enter the tower and insert the stone into a pedestal where it absorbs all the stone's energy. After fighting countless waves of enemies, Kratos opens the door and find themselves back in Midgard. With the tower restored, the duo plus Mimir lock J\u00f6tunheim in, but Mimir realizes that the travel crystal is missing. Mimir explains that they need his other eye to get to the realm. Without hesitation, they ask Brok and Sindri about it, but Sindri was unable to finish his part because of his germophobia, so Brok says that they stored Mimir's other eye in a vault in a statue of Thor that the Serpent ate. Kratos suggests the only way to retrieve it is by going inside the Serpent's belly. They make haste towards the horn where Mimir calls the serpent once again and asks if they could travel inside his stomach to retrieve his missing eye to which the serpent agrees. Kratos and Atreus row into the belly of the beast and manage to retrieve Mimir's other eye. As they leave,\u00a0however, a rumbling sound could be heard from the outside. Kratos and Atreus are thrown out of the serpent as the serpent falls back unconscious. While Atreus was wondering who hurt the serpent, Freya appears all of a sudden and says that she is looking for her son, saying that the woods and fields call his name. Kratos and Atreus become distant, as they find out that she is Baldur's mother after all. When Freya asks of why Atreus is standing so far from her, Baldur appears from the icy river and says that hurting the World Serpent would bring them out in the open. Baldur quickly notices his mother and Freya knows he's still angry and that how he feels hasn't changed. Baldur cuts her off mid-sentence saying that he doesn't need her to understand anything at all. Before Baldur could inflict damage on her, Kratos understands that even if he kills her, he will never find peace. Baldur says that he'll deal with him once he's done killing Freya, but Kratos pushes him back, which escalates into a fight with Freya trying to stop it by restraining both Kratos and Baldur. A few seconds into the fight, Freya restrains Kratos with Atreus attempting to free him. Baldur advises Atreus to step aside, but Atreus instead stands in front to protect his father, to which Baldur punches Atreus, only for the mistletoe arrow strapped to his quiver piercing his hand. Kratos, free from his bonds, tends to Atreus, to his surprise, is alright and not suffering any wounds. Baldur is astonished by the arrow\u00a0and starts to feel excitement upon the broken spell, before being restrained by Freya again, this time, in control of the reanimated corpse of Thamur. The corpse moves them to a new location. Atreus asks of how the mistletoe arrow broke the spell, Kratos adds that he can be killed.  Freya assures them that she can reason with him, but Kratos says that he means to kill her, to which Freya adds that she doesn't care and will protect him. A second fight ensures with the now vulnerable Baldur gleaming out to feel pain again. Midway through the fight, Kratos stuns Baldur, but Freya blocks their\u00a0path to him, but Kratos lifts the hand with ease and notices the crystal, and orders his son to shoot it at the exact timing, in which he does. As round three progresses, Freya summons cursed brood made from Vanir magic called legion to attack. As Kratos stuns Baldur, the reanimated giant, under the control of Freya, uses his chisel to separate the two, in which Baldur yells out he will kill her as he proceeds to climb the chisel with Kratos and Atreus hot on their trail. A short scuffle breaks out on top of the chisel\u00a0before Thamur tumbles them off onto his hand. In a stranglehold, Baldur tells them he wants to thank them for breaking the curse that has inflicted upon him and will rejoice soon. Kratos activates his Spartan Rage once again and breaks free with Atreus close behind. Another fight endures with Kratos and Atreus gaining the upper hand. Near the end of the fight, Kratos uses his Blades of Chaos to stun him before stunning him more with a series of close-by frontal attacks. Kratos beats Baldur relentlessly before Thamur uses his freeze breath in an attempt to freeze Kratos and Atreus. Atreus then calls the now conscious World Serpent, to separate Freya and Thamur. Kratos attempt to kill Baldur, but Atreus reminds him he is beaten. Kratos reminds Baldur in return to not come near them nor touch Freya again, in Freya says that she doesn't need protection and the two leave for mother and son to settle things out. Baldur explains that no matter where he goes or what he says, she will never stop interfering with his life. Freya explains that she was only trying to protect him. But Baldur says that she still needs to pay for the lifetime she stole from him. Freya explains that she has paid many times and if seeing herself dead will make things better, she lets Baldur strangle her. But Kratos interferes with Baldur saying that he could have walked away, in which Kratos quotes Zeus and explains that they must be better than this, before snapping his neck killing him at last. Freya is devastated upon seeing her son's lifeless body\u00a0and threatens Kratos to use all of her power to curse him. Atreus explains that he saved her life. But Freya is unfazed and calls Kratos an animal by passing his cruelty and rage, that he will never change. Kratos says that she does not know him well enough. Freya adds that she does, but does Atreus? Kratos tells Atreus to listen close\u00a0and informs him that he is from Sparta and how he made an oath to a god that cost him his soul. He killed many who were deserving and many who were not, and adds that he killed his father. Atreus is shocked upon learning that was his father killing his grandfather and asks of how this always ends, with children killing their parents since their gods. But Kratos assures him that they must strive to do better and not repeat the same mistakes as their predecessors. Freya leaves in silence afterward. Mimir asks if they're the bad guys now, Kratos says that might be true, but she could never make that choice. Atreus asks why Freya threatened his father even though she loathed the Aesir, Mimir states that they killed her son and that the death of a child is something that a parent cannot get over. But he assures him that Freya will get over her son's death over time and that Kratos did the right thing. They start the journey back to Tyr's Temple where Mimir explains Hrimthur's story, he adopted the guise of a mortal and promised the Aesir that if he can finish building the wall around Asgard within two years and finished it, he would meet with Freya, and if not, they will owe him nothing. Odin was suspicious of the stranger\u00a0but agreed to do as he asked. Using his father's knowledge of stone masonry, Hrimthur finished the wall, much to Odin's frustration. He met with Freya and whispered something in her ear, and as he was about to leave Asgard, Thor was waiting for him. The giant realizes he'd been double-crossed, but he did not care, as his plan was complete. Mimir suspects that Hrimthur added a weak spot in Asgard's walls and passed this knowledge to Freya.Jotunheim at last  After arriving at the Realm Travel Room, Kratos locks in J\u00f6tunheim and orders Atreus by giving him Mimir's head and positioning it into the beam and straight onto the door finally unlocking J\u00f6tunheim. Before Kratos and Atreus can finish their journey, Mimir says that they should leave him here, as he doesn't want a decomposing head ruining the father-son moment. Before Kratos could say anything, Brok and Sindri show up impressed and how they wanted to see this, Mimir at first refused, but knowing there would be no other way, he allowed the dwarfs to watch him. Kratos passes the head to Sindri, who passed to his brother and father and son make their way into the realm, with Mimir telling them to hurry back. Kratos and Atreus finally reach the giant's fingers, with Kratos unraveling his bandages saying that he has no more to hide. Kratos finally gives Atreus the bag of his mothers ashes. They make their way into a vast room where they encounter statues of giants, possibly the few remaining giants escaping Midgard. As they are leaving the room, Atreus touches the wall which crumbles around them and seeing a mural depiction of his mother with a bunch of giants, their meeting with the World Serpent for the first time, as well as the dragon in the mountain, the stonemason, and their fight with Baldur. Atreus realizes that the giants prophesied their journey. Kratos tells him that their journey is his story and that he's not the only parent with secrets making Atreus realize that he's a giant too. When Atreus asks why she didn't tell him, Kratos explains that she sent them here knowing she would find this and that she would've had good reasons. Kratos deduces that Baldur was never sent to find him, and he was tracking Faye all along, not knowing she was only ashes. Atreus, with a full set of confidence, says she hasn't been wrong yet and so close to the end, with Kratos looking at a plaque of Atreus holding a dead body screaming in agony. (most likely depicting his death, though this is yet to be true as there are inconsistencies with this body and Kratos.) Kratos and Atreus reach the top, noticing all the dead giants. Atreus hands over the bag full of ashes to his father, but Kratos says that they will do it together and calls him son. After spreading her ashes, Atreus realizes that the giants are all gone and his name on the wall, the giant's called him Loki. Kratos found out that was the name Faye wanted to call him when he was born. When Atreus asks why\u00a0Kratos says they will find out some other day. As the two leave, Atreus asks of why he wanted to be called that name. Kratos tells him he was named after a compassionate spartan soldier who filled the lives of everyone with joy and happiness. Atreus is impressed and tells him he actually told a good story and that Mimir missed it. As they near the travel room, Atreus understand that they should go home, but they could prove themselves useful by exploring some more and defeating corrupted Valkyries. As they enter the room, Mimir is glad to see them and adds that he reached his limit for dwarven charm. As they are heading back to Midgard, Mimir warns them that Fimbulwinter-the great winter that precedes Ragnarok is upon them as it was not supposed to happen for a couple hundred years and that Kratos may have accelerated the events. As they arrive home, Atreus says that he will sleep through winter. Kratos tells him to get some rest, with Atreus adding that he is way ahead of them, in which Atreus has a vision of Thor showing up at their house when Fimbulwinter ends. When they wake up, Atreus felt like this was real, at first Kratos isn't disturbed by this, but when Atreus reminds him again, he assures his son that they will worry about it tomorrow.Powers and Abilities  As a demigod, Kratos possesses incredible superhuman physical prowess, beyond that of any mortal or beast and surpassing all other Greek Gods, the exact limits of which are yet to be determined. It is presumed Kratos was born with his god-like abilities due to being Zeus' demigod son. He might also be partially immortal and may have gotten stronger when he absorbed powers from the Gods. Due to these abilities, Kratos was able to defeat monsters, magical beings, Titans and even the Gods themselves. His old age does not hamper his physical capabilities, as he has displayed the ability to outmatch the most physically powerful of the Norse Gods, such as Baldur and Magni. When using the Spartan Rage, he was able to easily scare off Modi. Apparently, he is one of the few in the Norse realm\u00a0who has the physical power to potentially rival the likes of Thor and Odin. It is worth noting that Odin is greatly afraid of him as he knows that Kratos will be involved in Ragnarok. Kratos possesses incredible superhuman strength, which seems to fluctuate depending on the situation. He can easily subdue and rip apart many large and powerful beasts and creatures such as Undead Legionnaires, infected humans, monsters, and magical beings in half, using only his bare hands and can easily rip off Helios' head. and is capable of overpowering the Hydra, throwing the Colossus of Rhodes after it attempted to crush him beneath its foot, and preventing both Cronos and Atlas from crushing him. In his battle against Hercules, who is considered to be unrivaled in terms of sheer strength, Kratos proved capable of stopping his charges, forcing him backward\u00a0and enduring his powerful bear hugs without any ill effects, even breaking free from them and defeating him. He has always physically overpowered all other Norse Gods he fought. His strength remains unaffected by his age, as despite being now elderly in the Nordic realm, Kratos was able to easily snap the neck of a troll with his bare hands, lift, throw and even smash massive boulders, and physically equal and eventually overpower among the strongest of the Norse Gods such as Baldur, one of the sons of Odin and Magni, the strongest of the children of Thor. His spartan rage increases his strength to the point where he can create earthquakes with a single stomp. In addition to his vast physical strength, Kratos also possesses great levels of superhuman agility, stamina, durability, endurance, reflexes, and speed. Feats of durability include falling from great heights and walking away unharmed, getting crushed, stabbed, beaten, blasted, and burned by various enemies and traps as well as survive extreme environments such as Hel, the Norse Realm of the Dead, which according to Mimir was said to be so cold that not even Odin himself can survive there for long, as well as Muspelheim. Kratos's speed allows him to keep up with opponents who possess vast speed, such as Zeus who has the speed of lightning, Charon, Hermes, and Pollux and Castor who possessed Chronokinesis. He is also able to regenerate from most wounds at a fast rate, though he did not regenerate from the scar on his stomach caused by the Blade of Olympus and the scar over his right eye caused by Ares for reasons unknown (maybe he cannot fully regenerate himself from scars caused by gods' power). Kratos also possesses powerful resistance to most forms of attack and magic (ex: time manipulation, illusion, and soul manipulation) that would easily kill most humans or magical beings. When Kratos loses in battle or war and is killed, he simply escapes the Underworld to Earth. Kratos can change his fate by manipulating or traveling in time. Kratos also has absorbed the power of Hope, allowing him to kill the immortal Olympians. After Kratos killed Ares, Athena made him the new God of War, giving him the powers of a God. Kratos could grow 500 or more feet tall, as well as become a fiery comet which would lay waste to all below him, and possessed all powers of a God of War. It is possible he had acquired a permanent level of power and ability beyond even that of demigod from his constant trials and contact with different powers and magic. Kratos, before and after becoming a God, gained many powers and weapons from the Gods.\u00a0When he relinquished his old powers to the Blade of Olympus, he was given new powers by the Titans. Some of these powers resemble the abilities given to him by the Gods. The Blade of Olympus is one of Kratos' greatest weapons, as he has infused all of his godly power into it. Although often defined by his brute strength, he also has a wisdom almost matching the goddess Athena as he is quite cunning and knowledgeable having managed to solve many puzzles throughout his journey, many of them created by famous architects like Archimedes, Daedalus or Pathos Verdes III, and even some Nordic puzzles as such he not only survived all the traps and creatures within but he also become the only one to break those challenges. He also managed to solve the Olympus' Garden puzzle which even Hera had not believed he could. Interestingly enough, Kratos, when he had a godly power that can make him into a giant, such as when he fought in Rhodes, and similar to his empowerment against Ares, he seemed to prefer to use his normal mortal size to battle many powerful creatures and gods. Kratos also was wise enough to use the environment against his enemies, like using the bridge mechanic to kill a Kraken or using Gaia's heart to restore his health. The most notable event that proves his wisdom is when he manages to break out of Aegaeon the Hekantonkheires prison by using Megaera's anger toward him. He even got the upper hand on Zeus during their second encounter by feigning defeat and causing Zeus to lower his guard enough for Kratos to effectively and immediately strike him and nearly kill him. Kratos also has useful skills that include climbing mountains and building, jumping great heights, and swinging on ropes to cross long gaps. He is capable of sensing danger and possesses great skills and accuracy with all forms of weapon and powerful magic as well as hand-to-hand combat, making him an extremely formidable fighter coupled with his colossal physical prowess.Weapons  Before serving Ares, Kratos' main weapon was his sword. Under Ares' rule, Kratos' main weapons became the Blades of Chaos, a gift from Ares as a sign of his servitude. They are essentially two Falchion-like blades on long chains, permanently fused and seared to the wielder's forearms. Once Kratos killed Ares, Athena replaced them with a nearly identical pair of blades called the Blades of Athena, and then replaces them again in God of War III with the very similar Blades of Exile. Kratos displays proficiency with all of his weapons. It is implied that he learned many of his fighting skills from Ares and other gods, the former God of War himself. Initially, Kratos also had a massive Spartan army under his command, used both before and during his servitude under Ares. When he finds himself in the Nordic Realm, Kratos seems to have lost all the weapons he obtained from his quest of vengeance, having been destroyed by Zeus back when he was fighting him. But the Blades of Chaos are shown to still be in his possession, but decides to hide them under his cabin. This probably acts as a way for him to move on while still reminding himself of the atrocities he committed. He initially wields a magic axe known as the Leviathan which he found in the woods where he met Faye, the mother of his future son, Atreus. The axe has the properties of ice magic as swinging its blade creates light blue energy waves, which can be charged up, and hitting the ground freezes enemies close to impact. Kratos also throws the axe directly towards opponents in battle and it seems that it can return to his hand by raising it but only for a limited range. While the Blades of Chaos, whom he unearthed to fight the forces in Helheim, possessed the properties of fire, which can also burn enemies in a certain heavy combo attack, the Leviathan's ice magic is very effective against enemies with the attribute of Burn, while the fiery swing of the Blades damage effectively those of Frost. After meeting with Brok and Sindri, gem slots called Runic Attacks are given on each weapon's head that modifies the axe's and the blades' abilities. Kratos also wields the Guardian Shield, a golden circular shield attached to a golden gauntlet in his arm that he uses both offensively and defensively. He wears it like a brace for his left forearm but it instantly retracts to its full form at will. He is shown to pair this with his axe or his left Blade of Chaos in battle. He can infuse the magical abilities of his axe and the fire of his left Blade of Chaos into the shield, allowing for more explosive and devastating combos. And he is able to parry with the shield, managing to deflect enemy projectiles back at them.Appearance  Kratos is the epitome of what a Spartan soldier is in that he is essentially made for battle. He is exceptionally tall, standing at a height between 6 and 7 feet, in which, due to his status a warrior, he is at his peak physical condition. Based on his facial features and voice patterns, one can assume Kratos' age is ranging from the late 30s to early 40s of the first games. Prior to the series' actual time of taking place he had tanned skin and a red tattoo going down the majority of his upper body and up to his face. On his face, besides the aforementioned tattoo, he has a scar on his right eye and a black goatee. The scar was caused by Ares when Kratos was a child and tried to save his brother from the raid of Gods on Sparta. After killing his beloved wife and child, two of the few people he truly cared for, the village oracle bound their ashes to his skin to be forever a reminder of the horrible deed he committed on that day. As a Spartan General prior to his service to Ares, Kratos wore Spartan hoplite armor and after becoming the new God of War he wore a very elaborately decorated piece of armor. By the end of God of War III, Kratos only wears a leather loincloth and armlets without the chains of the Blades of Exile. As of God of War (2018), Kratos' appearance changes slightly. He appears older, with more wrinkles on his face looking to be in his mid to late 50s or 60s. His goatee has grown into a bushy, full beard which covers half his face and has several gray hairs. His skin is still pale and covered with the ashes of his Spartan family, and his tattoos have faded slightly. He retains the scar on his abdomen, however, it is larger and less jagged than before due to him stabbing himself at the end of God of War III. Also from the same wound, he now has a long scar covering almost all of his back. Also present are faded scars from where the chains from the blades were attached to his forearms, which he prefers to keep covered beneath with what appears to be fur-lined leather, secured with thongs of leather.Kratos' Affixed Ashes  As Kratos attacked a village which worshiped the goddess Athena at the behest of his lord at the time, Ares, the Oracle who resided in the village warned the Spartan to not enter the Temple of Athena. Kratos, however, disregarded her warnings and slaughtered the people in the temple. After the massacre, Kratos had realized that he had not only murdered all in the temple, but he had unintentionally murdered his wife and child. As Kratos mournfully cradled the unmoving body of his dead wife, he discovered that Ares had orchestrated his family's death. After leaving the burning temple, the Oracle placed a spell on Kratos, a spell which caused the ashes of his wife and child to be forever affixed to his skin. As in God of War (2018), He keeps this appearance to his later life in Midgard, although some parts of his skin have pinked in color for some reason. Only in God of War: Chains of Olympus is Kratos seen without the ashes, not including flashbacks and bonus costumes.Personality  Throughout most of the series (particularly the later entries preceding his journey to Norway), Kratos is incredibly cruel, reckless, and destructive, willing to kill anyone who gets in his way, even innocent people. He is also shown to be incapable of accepting full responsibility for his actions, usually blaming the gods (especially Zeus, Ares, and Athena) for his suffering while ignoring or denying his own part in it. The memory of his misdeeds has driven Kratos to attempt suicide on at least two separate occasions. Earlier on in the series canon, he is less callous towards the lives of others, albeit perfectly willing to sacrifice an innocent bystander when it is required of him. He also exhibits a deep sense of shame and horror at his reputation as the Ghost of Sparta. One example is when Kratos tries to convince a woman in Athens to give him a key, only for her to run away in terror and call him a monster; Kratos is visibly aghast by the fear and hatred others have for him. This shame was further demonstrated when he observed the massacres committed by Ares' minions, causing him to question what he had become. In God of War: Ascension, his earliest canonical appearance, he genuinely mourns the death of Orkos and the Delphic Oracle, even giving Orkos a decent funeral pyre. In Delphi, when Castor orders the guards to remove Kratos from the Oracle's temple, Kratos spares them when they have the good sense to flee. On the island of Delos, he is merciful enough to push an innocent man out of the way of an incoming spear, whereas he would have most likely just let him die in later games. It is possible that Kratos had yet to develop the apathy for others' lives that would come with his later experiences, but this is not proven. He is also very libidinous and sexually passionate with many women, although as stated by Gaia, he never found true happiness or comfort in these acts, with Lysandra being the only woman he ever loved. Before and during the original God of War, Kratos was also respectful towards gods and divine entities (with the exception of Ares, whom he also called \"Lord\" up until his betrayal and Persephone), to the point of calling them \"Lords\", although he did not fully trust them. As time went on, he became disillusioned with the gods and began to respect them less and less. At the end of his service to the gods of Olympus, when it became clear that they would never relieve him of his nightmares, he became openly defiant and hostile towards them, even after being made a god himself, his hatred however reached it\u2019s peak after learning of their role in his mother\u2019s and brother's suffering after which he swore vengeance upon them .He was also respectful towards Gaia due to her helping him in his quest, although he was skeptical as to why she was doing so. Following her betrayal, Kratos lost all respect for divine beings, and began ruthlessly murdering god and titan alike. However, he is shown to care for Athena to some degree (and vice versa), with Kratos being more affected by her death than even Zeus, who seemed to care very little (if at all) about her death. He is also tolerant of Aphrodite and Hephaestus since they are both indifferent (and in the latter's case, even somewhat supportive) to his war on Olympus. It is likely that he felt a certain level of kinship with Hephaestus, as they share a mutual hatred of Zeus as well as intense pain over their lost daughters, although he is eventually forced to kill the Smith God when he tries to prevent him from reaching his daughter, Pandora. In spite of this, Kratos respected Hephaestus' desire to protect Pandora as he told her that her father died doing what any father should do: protecting the life of his child and even tried to stop Pandora from killing herself even requiring her convincing to allow her to sacrifice herself. By the time of God of War III, Kratos is so blinded by rage and obsessed with killing Zeus that he does not notice, or care, that he is destroying the entire Greece in his quest for revenge, coldly ignoring the warnings of Athena, Poseidon, Hera, and Zeus himself that his murdering of the gods would bring about the end of life on the Grecian world. He does, however, express extreme guilt for what he has done to Greece after killing Zeus, ultimately attempting suicide over it. In spite of his cruel acts, Kratos is shown to care deeply for his wife and daughter, with the memories of their deaths driving him to the point of madness. In fact, the one and only time Kratos is shown to be happy is when he briefly reunites with his daughter, Calliope, in Chains of Olympus. He also cared for his younger brother Deimos and his mother Callisto, with their deaths further contributing to his growing hatred for the Gods of Olympus. In addition, Kratos respected his fellow Spartans, including the Last Spartan\u00a0who he encountered several times during God of War: Ghost of Sparta and God of War II. When he learned of Sparta's destruction at Zeus' hand, Kratos was devastated and angrily demanded that Zeus come down and face him. During his battle with Zeus at the end of God of War II, he declared that he would not let him destroy Sparta, demonstrating that he cared for Sparta and its people. In God of War III, Kratos grows attached to Pandora as she reminds him of his own daughter, even mistaking her for Calliope upon their first encounter, despite the fact that she's only an \"object\". He became filled with rage after Hera insulted Pandora, and responded by killing her. Kratos ultimately tried to stop Pandora from sacrificing herself, although he was unsuccessful. When Kratos encountered his half-siblings or cousins, he merely ignored them or told them to step aside, indicating that he does not harbor any particular hatred for them, but will kill them if necessary. This was shown in his confrontations with Theseus and Hercules. Despite his war on Olympus, Kratos (at least initially) only truly desired the death of Zeus, and possibly Poseidon and Hades as well. For example, Kratos was legitimately interested, though understandably suspicious, when Helios offered to help Kratos as a way of repaying his debt, implying that Kratos would have spared him if not for his treachery. He also tries to ignore Hermes at first, viewing him as more of a pest than a serious threat, and only attacks him after incessant provocation.In God of War (2018)  After destroying Olympus, remarrying, and siring another child, Atreus, in Norway, Kratos becomes a more stoic character, only bursting out in anger when antagonized or threatened. Although he is sometimes prone to outbursts when disciplining his son, he almost always manages to regain control of himself before doing any damage. He also accepts full responsibility for his actions in Greece, often exhibiting extreme sadness and regret, and at times even falling into a state of depression, when confronted about his past behavior, he now also dreads being called the \"Ghost of Sparta\", angrily telling Mimir not to call him that. He is also more considerate to others' feelings as well, as he sternly reproaches Atreus when the latter asking Sindri the reason of Brok's blue skin while he himself doesn't. As a result of his drastic maturity, Kratos is shameful of his past and prefers to keep it a secret from his son. However, he eventually realizes being open to Atreus with his mistakes would allow Atreus to learn from Kratos' mistakes and not go down the dark path he himself once trodden. Following his union with Faye, Kratos went to great lengths to cover up his past as a God, especially from Atreus. Believing that his son\u2019s godhood was a curse, Kratos kept the truth hidden with hopes that Atreus would live a normal life, though his secrecy became the source of his son\u2019s recurring illness. Unfortunately for Kratos, Atreus despite his compassionate nature appears to have inherited his father's impulsiveness and tendency towards rage. He is alarmed at Atreus' outbursts and is quick to reprimand him for it, fearing that he will become the same monster as Zeus was in Greece. He is shown to love Atreus just as he loved Calliope, Lysandra, and most likely Faye. Telling his son that they would complete the journey together. Kratos's relationship with Faye is not well-known but it is apparent that they had a very close and loving relationship, as Kratos openly acknowledges that Faye was better than a God and wondered if he could raise his son without her. He also respected Faye's wishes of not taking Atreus hunting, resulting in Kratos being gone most of the time hunting for the family. However, his distrust for divine beings remains intact, opting to avoid interaction with the Norse Gods whenever possible, even when they (like Freya) try to befriend and help him. He is also shown to still harbor resentment towards the gods of Olympus, promptly telling the spirit of Athena to leave his head the moment she appears. He likewise reassures her that, while he is still a monster, he is no longer her monster. Despite this, Kratos is shown to have become more reasonable in dealing with the Norse Gods, as he was able to come to trust and care for Freya after she saved his son despite all of his previous distrust. Even after learning Freya had bewitched Mimir to prevent them from learning Baldur's weakness, Kratos cared enough to fight Baldur for her and later saved her life by killing Baldur when he attempted to choke her to death. He did not harm her when she swore vengeance on him, likely as he understands the pain she feels, having felt the same after killing his family, and believes that time will eventually cause her to forgive him. He also came to develop a strong friendship with Mimir, eventually taking his advice\u00a0more and even comforting him at times. Kratos now only kills out of self-defense and does not see the point in killing a weakened enemy. He even tries to be the voice of reason when Atreus finds out he is a god and lets it go to his head. Though he does not exactly like being around Brok and Sindri, Kratos is never rude or ill-natured around them and even allows them to work on his weaponry and gear, he was even shocked when Atreus asked why Brok is blue and when he badmouths Sindri, showing that he is at least sensitive enough to know when to not make an enemy. He was even willing to spare a weakened Modi and was greatly shocked and angered when Atreus, who learned of his godhood and became much more arrogant killed him. Likewise, for Baldur, Kratos offered him multiple chances to step aside and only fought him when threatened. He ultimately offered Baldur a chance to escape when he was defeated and even tried reasoning with him saying that vengeance is not a path to be walked by as people would not find peace, recounting his own experience with it. Due to his slaying of the Gods of Olympus, Kratos now understands that vengeance will not bring him or others peace, even trying to talk Baldur out of killing Freya and then killing him when he attempts to do so to try and end the cycle of children killing their parents. When Freya threatens Kratos and swears vengeance against him, he does not retaliate in anger and simply replies that she does not know him, showing maturity and self-control. When Atreus accused Kratos of not caring for Faye, he was simply annoyed and told Atreus to stop talking. Although Kratos does not seem to enjoy troubling himself by helping dead spirits, mainly because they no longer have any \"needs, only wants\", he does help people when need be. When prompted by Mimir to rescue the valkyries, Kratos complained, but submitted to the task. When they reached J\u00f6tunheim, Mimir wanted to stay behind because their business was between Atreus and Kratos, but Kratos objected at first because he didn't want any affliates of Odin finding Mimir. At the beginning of his journey with Atreus, Kratos kept his forearms wrapped in bandages to hide the scars from his chained blades, symbolizing his desire to hide his past from his son. At the end of their journey, after coming clean to his son about his past, Kratos threw away his bandages, deciding he has nothing left to hide from his son. Kratos has also developed a dry sense of humor such as when Mimir asked Atreus to carry him since Kratos was tackling deadly traps, Kratos replied he would not want Mimir to miss \"this\" (the excitement of dodging the traps) and smirk slightly when Mimir claimed Kratos was enjoying himself.Trivia In Greek Mythology In General In Greek Era In Nordic Era Guest Appearances Other Media External links God of War III  God of War III is the fifth installment in the popular God of War series, released on March 16, 2010 for the PlayStation 3, and a remastered version on July 14, 2015 for the PlayStation 4. It is the seventh chapter in the series chronologically, after God of War: Ascension, God of War: Chains of Olympus, God of War, God of War: Ghost of Sparta, God of War: Betrayal and God of War II.Story  Following the ending of God of War II, God of War III picks up directly after this with a stirring opening narration from Zeus discussing the actions of the rogue Kratos, who is 'commanding' a small army of Titans rescued from the Great War (using the power of the Fates). The Olympians immediately rush to battle; Helios rides on his chariot over Olympus, Hermes speeds down the very peaks of Olympus as Zeus watches on, Hercules receives the order to lead his troops down into the fray, Hades lunges off and engages several Titans in his giant form, and Poseidon (using his aquakinesis) shoots down from Olympus like a missile and performs a death blow through the chest of Epimetheus, and then manifests himself as a massive water being and spawns several water horses called Hippocampi to aid in the battle. With Poseidon as their greatest threat in the battle, having already decimated numerous Titans and soon going after Gaia herself, Kratos engages the God of the Sea and after drawing him into Gaia's grasp manages to knock a weakened Poseidon out of his godly form and onto a separate platform. The two\u00a0quarrel with\u00a0each other briefly before Kratos walks up and beats the Lord of the Sea savagely, finally gouging out his eyes and snapping his neck\u00a0before he tosses him into the ocean. With Poseidon's death, the seas cataclysm and ocean levels rise significantly, causing a flood that appears to engulf the entire world and destroying almost all of mankind save those on top of Olympia. After killing Poseidon, Gaia and Kratos reach Zeus' pavilion, where the king of the gods angrily anticipates Kratos' arrival and, at last, assaults them with a mighty blast of lightning that blows off a massive amount of Gaia's arm and sends the two spiraling down Olympus (Kratos survives presumably by using the Golden Fleece to absorb most of the blast). However, even using the Blade of Olympus to stab into her back, Kratos is unable to hang on as Gaia fights to survive and climb back up to Zeus. She warns him that he was only a pawn and is now expendable now that the Titans have reached Zeus, allowing the embittered Spartan to tumble to his death. Kratos contemplates his life as he lurches through the River Styx and its caverns, and resolves to escape Hades (once again) and destroy Zeus. On his way to Hades' chamber after being sucked of nearly all of his power from the dead souls of Styx, he reunites with a newly-formed Athena who claims to have reached a \"new level of existence\" and is willing to help Kratos assume his revenge, granting him new weapons to survive the Underworld and the foes that lie ahead, and also defining his next quest of finding and extinguishing the Flame of Olympus in order to truly defeat Zeus. Kratos makes his way through the Underworld meeting a couple of lost souls, encountering statues of the judges of the Underworld, meeting Hephaestus who informs him more and more about the secrets of Olympus and Zeus, and finding mysterious scrawls on the ground that he silently acknowledges to be from various people in his past. Finally entering Hades' palace he finds the coffin-wed body of Persephone that Hades had restored, and engages the Lord of the Underworld himself inside of a dark cavern. Hades matches Kratos until the bloodthirsty Spartan manages to rip off his helmet and steal his weapons, and then ripping out Hades' own soul and absorbs it using the Claws of Hades. Escaping the Underworld through a Hyperion Gate, Kratos renews his journey up along Olympus except that he now faces both the Titans and the Gods - he encounters Helios on his chariot where later he rips the sun god's head off with his bare hands and receives the Head of Helios, he 'amputates' the legs of Hermes acquiring the Boots of Hermes, mercilessly beats his own half-brother Hercules to death with the Nemean Cestus, breaks Hera's neck after she insults Pandora, a small childlike creation of Hephaestus who is the key to extinguishing the Flame of Olympus and revealing its contents, encountering a radiant Aphrodite and her handmaidens in the goddess' chamber, stabbing the Titan Cronos in the head with the Blades of Olympus at Tartarus, impaling Hephaestus after betraying Kratos to Cronos, receiving the Nemesis Whip from Hephaestus just before his death, battles Skorpius, The Queen of the Scorpions and finally arriving at the Flame's chamber with Pandora, only to be interrupted by Zeus himself. Zeus prevents Pandora from her destiny and engages Kratos, though the latter bests the King of the Gods in a duel and suddenly has a change of heart. Pandora was made to be the Key to Pandora's Box, which is what truly rests within the Flame of Olympus, and would have to sacrifice herself. However, due to inadvertent prodding from Zeus pleads that Kratos not \"fail in his decisions this time\", Kratos releases Pandora and attacks Zeus in extreme rage, only to be stunned by the Flame's dissipation. Kratos opens the Box once again, just as he had in the first game, only to discover that it is empty. Zeus mocks him for \"another failure\", and teleports outside in order to recover, while Kratos' rage grows even stronger. Father and son meet outside once again on a familiar platform, but before either can claim victory, the platform is suddenly shaken by a reawakened Gaia (believed to have been killed during the fight and subject of many Titans anger against Kratos), who violently shakes them and causes them to flee inside of her body. Inside of her chest, Kratos and Zeus duel near her heart; Zeus sucks her heart of her life and rejuvenates as does Kratos, and finally, Gaia is killed when Kratos impales Zeus against her heart, which apparently also killed Zeus. Awakening amidst cracked earth, Kratos finds Zeus' body impaled on a rock, and extracts the blade callously. However, when Kratos tries to leave, Zeus' still active spirit, consumed by some lasting hatred for his 'infidel' son, attacks and apparently drains Kratos of his willpower, his anger, and instead fills him with fear and a sense of loss whilst throwing him on the verge of death. Before dying, Kratos shares a last-minute mental journey with the guide of Pandora, whose spirit lives on within him, and begins abolishing the various things that torment his soul - the very things that the Astral Zeus is using to kill his mind, similar to what Ares once did. Overcoming these hurtles with a feeling of Hope, Kratos regains conscious and forces Zeus' spirit back into his body, before beating Zeus to death with his bare hands, ending the reign of the Olympians once and for all as it seems... Athena arrives to congratulate Kratos on his victory and requests that he turn over the power he claimed from Pandora's Box, but he reveals that there was nothing inside. Athena claims he is lying, because when the evils of the Titanomachy were first sealed into the box, as a safety measure, she placed into the box the \"most powerful weapon in the world\", hope, to counter act the evils. She demands Kratos return this power he obtained from the box that rightfully belongs to her, for now that the world is cleansed by chaos, she will rebuild it under her rule with the power of hope. Athena realizes, however, that when Kratos first opened the box to kill Ares, as the evils infected and took hold of the gods of Olympus, especially Zeus, the power of hope infused itself into Kratos. Hope had been buried deep beneath the anger, need for vengeance, and guilt, and when Kratos had finally learned to forgive himself for his past, he had released the power. Athena again demands Kratos give her the power, but Kratos refuses, and impales himself on the Blade of Olympus. Which then, a large ray of blue light releases itself into the sky, giving all mankind the power of Hope. Athena becomes furious, claiming that man will not know what to do with Hope. She removes the sword from Kratos, and departs, telling Kratos how disappointed she is by his actions. He snarls he owes her nothing (a callback to the beginning of the second game). In the post-credits scene, the spot where Kratos' body was lying is now empty, with a trail of blood going off the edge of the cliff. This scene is reminiscent of his suicide attempt in God of War. However, it seems he traveled to another world in God of War (2018).David Jaffe's Cut Plot  In an interview with GameTrailers.com, David Jaffe explained his story to God of War III. The first cutscene featured Oceanus in his water form (similar to Poseidon's God form) killing Hermes. Kratos then would fight Zeus in the opening boss fight and kill him. Then a portal opens on Mt. Olympus where the Egyptian and Norse Gods descend from. The Titans and the Greek, Egyptian, and Norse Gods wage a war to determine who would ultimately rule the world. Kratos then discovers the power to teleport back and forth through Norway, Egypt, and Greece. Kratos encounters Stheno and takes her head in a boss fight. Then in another boss fight with the Sphinx, Kratos uses Stheno's head to turn the beast into stone (and that's how we have the Sphinx statue today in Egypt). Kratos then realizes the way to permanently kill a God is to get mortals to stop believing in them. Kratos' plan was already in effect because the Gods were focused on ruling the world and had their minds off of the mortals. Thus, the mortal world was under natural disasters. The mortals stopped believing in the Gods, which weakened them. Kratos & the Titans kill off the remaining Gods. Kratos then uses the Blades of Athena to slit his wrists, resulting in another trip to the Underworld where he is reunited with his wife & daughter. The final cutscene showed the Three Wise Men heading to the North Star resulting with the birth of Christianity. Bit of War, a God of War III demake, follows David Jaffe's version of the plot loosely.Items and abilities Weapons Magic Items Relics Godly Possessions  The Godly Possessions are magical items that once belonged to the gods can now be found hidden in several places in the game. Once found they can be used at any time during your second play through. They can be very helpful, but once you activate a Godly Possession you will not be able to receive any Trophies for the entire play through.Enemies Common Enemies Bosses Characters Sequel  When asked about a possible sequel, director Stig Asmussen revealed this, in a March 2010 article on 1UP: When asked if he felt the same way about portable entries or other forms the series could take beyond PlayStation home console releases, he said, However, despite this, a full gameplay trailer for a fourth game was revealed at E3 2016. God of War (2018) was released on April 20th, 2018, as a Playstation 4 exclusive.Cast Critical Reception  God of War III has received critical and universal acclaim. In the February 16, 2010 edition of the Official PlayStation Magazine UK, the first review score was given as 9/10. Reviewer Nathan Ditum says \"the game is inches away from scoring 10/10, it's only the familiarity of the core gameplay that makes it feel less than the very, very best. But it's definitely the biggest, and if this is the finale, then God of War III gives PlayStation's toughest hero the send-off he deserves.\" Ditum also praised the graphics, stating it was as good if not better than Killzone 2 and Uncharted 2: Among Thieves. IGN (9.3/10) praised the game stating that \"God of War III practically redefines what the word 'scale' means with regards to videogames, as it throws you into scenes with Titans that are larger than entire levels in some other games.\" The only complaint the IGN reviewer had was \"that two of the three additional weapons that you'll earn are extremely similar to your blades. They have unique powers and slightly different moves, but by and large, they're more of the same.\" In terms of visuals, the reviewer said that \"God of War III presents some of the most impressive visuals that I've ever seen in a game. Kratos in particular looks phenomenal, and is perhaps the single most impressive-looking character ever in videogames.\" GameSpot (9.0/10) stated God of War III sticks to the strengths already established by its predecessors, but what it lacks in innovation it more than makes up for in execution. The combat is simple to pick up, but the added moves and weapons give it more depth than before, and the spectacular visuals make fights even more brutal. But God of War III is so much more than its satisfying combat. The imaginative visual design and moody classical score balance your quest for vengeance with artistic pleasures, and the well-crafted puzzles further tap into your cerebral vein. God of War III is a brilliantly paced, meticulously detailed adventure that thrills and satisfies until the very end.Awards  God of War III was awarded \"Most Anticipated Game of 2010\" at the 2009 Spike Video Game Awards and GameTrailers awarded God of War III with the \"GameTrailers Diamond Award\" for exceeding ten million views.

The Olympian gods had a king, Zeus, who reigned over both man and god from his divine throne on Mount Olympus. They served as minor protagonists in the first game, helping Kratos with his quest to kill Ares; however, as the series progressed, they turned into one of the series' main antagonists.Greek Mythology  The gods, along with the Titans, are supreme mythical beings that can create and control all kinds of magic and power. In Greek mythology, the gods, also called the Olympians (\u0394\u03c9\u03b4\u03b5\u03ba\u03ac\u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03bd), were the principal gods of the Greek pantheon, residing atop Mount Olympus, a place forbidden for any mortal to travel unless given direct authorization to do so by the gods themselves. The 6 original Olympians were Hades, Hestia, Poseidon, Demeter, Hera, and Zeus. Later on there were 12 true Olympians, which included: Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Demeter, Ares, Hermes, Hephaestus, Aphrodite, Athena, Apollo, Artemis, Dionysus and Hestia, who later gave up her throne for Dionysus. Hades was not included because he resided in his home of the Underworld, rarely speaking with any of the other gods. The 12 mighty Olympians gained their supremacy in the world after Zeus led his siblings to victory in the war with the Titans. The six original Olympians were the children of Cronos and Rhea (Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Demeter, Hestia, and Hades). Ares, Hermes, Hephaestus, Athena, Apollo, Artemis, the Charites, Hercules, Dionysus, the Muses, Hebe, and Persephone were children of Zeus and Aphrodite was born\u00a0of\u00a0sea foam from\u00a0Ouranos's remains were all later recognized as Olympians. Helios, Eos, and Selene are other important Olympians and goddesses which are sometimes included in a group of twelve. Greeks of good age knew of poetry about the war between the Gods and Titans. The dominant one, and the only one that had survived was in the Theogony attributed to Hesiod. A lost epic, Titanomachia - attributed to the legendary blind Thracian bard Thamyris - was not mentioned in passing in an essay 'Music on Music' that was once attributed to Plutarch.In-Game History Description  Gods made their appearances in every installment and are an important element in the series. They first appeared as the main allies of Kratos, granting him powerful magics and weapons throughout his journey. After Zeus' betrayal, Kratos allies with the Titans in the hopes of obtaining revenge against Zeus, declaring war on the rest of Olympus as well. By God of War III, they are the main group of antagonists whom Kratos kills, one after another.Birth and Prophecy  In the beginning, there was Chaos, the first primordial void from which all of creation came. From Chaos came the Island of Creation and together with the Island, the Sisters of Fate were born as some of the first creatures of the world. Over time, the Titans evolved from the island itself, becoming the source of all nature and magic.\u00a0 Later, the Titans left the island and forged the rest of the world. Reigning over the Titans, the mighty Cronos learned from Gaia that one day he would be overthrown by his own children. In an attempt to gain their favor, Cronos gifted the Sisters with the Steeds of Time. Although they accepted the gift, they refused to change his fate. Trying to prevent the inevitable, Cronos devoured his children born of Rhea one by one: Poseidon, Hades, Hera, Demeter and Hestia. When the time came that the last of his children, Zeus, was to be swallowed, Rhea could not bear another such loss. She devised a plan to have Zeus taken to a place far away from the watchful eyes of his cruel father. Calling upon the eagle, Rhea kissed her son goodbye as he was taken to be watched over by Gaia. Rhea wrapped a\u00a0stone in cloth and Cronos swallowed it, foolishly believing it to be Zeus.Great War  Under the care of Gaia, Zeus was raised with the desire to free his siblings from the belly of Cronos. When he came of age, he journeyed back to the Island of Creation and forced Cronos to regurgitate his siblings. Fully grown, these new gods came to be known as the Olympians, and started a war against the Titans, thus betraying Gaia, whose act of compassion would haunt the Titans for the rest of their lives. Atlas led the Titans into a furious battle, although some Titans, like Prometheus and Helios, would betray their fellow Titans and join the Olympians. Hades and Poseidon managed to bring Atlas to his knees and steal his soul, but this would not stop the Titans from continuing their efforts to eliminate the Olympians. The war would completely reshape the landscape of the mortal world into its current shape. Zeus forged a weapon from both the heavens and the Earth called the Blade of Olympus, which was used to banish the Titans to the darkest pits of the Underworld \u2013 Tartarus. This battle also caused evils to accumulate, which would later be stored in Pandora's Box to protect humanity from corruption.Aftermath  The Titans were brutally tortured for eternity as a permanent reminder of what they had done, despite Cronos being the only Titan who had done anything wrong in the first place. Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades split the world into three. Zeus was given domain over the heavens and was ultimately the ruler of both the gods and all of the universe; Poseidon was given domain over all forms of water, controlling the seas, winds and weather; Hades was given domain over the Underworld, the darkest realm of the world where the souls of the dead would journey. Prometheus, caring for the lowly mortals, gave them the fires of Mount Olympus, which Zeus perceived as a betrayal. In response, Zeus robbed Prometheus of his immortality and forced him to endure great suffering by having an eagle consume him every day, fully healing and resurrecting him each time so that this cycle of torment would never cease. Helios, however, became the god of the sun and light and was accepted in the Greek pantheon.Birth of the Evils  As mentioned previously, the conclusion of the Great War also marked the birth of the Evils, ethereal manifestations of all of the world's vices and corruption. Zeus, realizing the danger they posed if left free, commissioned Hephaestus to construct a vessel to contain them -Pandora's Box- which would be placed within the Flame of Olympus to ensure that no one could ever release the Evils within. However, upon completing the box, Hephaestus recommended the back of Cronos as the best place to hide it, reasoning that no one would be able to defeat the mighty Titan to reach it. Unbeknownst to Zeus, Hephaestus' choice was an attempt to protect Pandora, the living key to the Flame of Olympus whom Hephaestus had come to see as his own daughter. With that matter settled, Zeus drew the Evils into Pandora's Box. Athena also placed the essence of Hope inside the box, as a means to counteract the Evils in the event that the box was ever opened.Pandora's Temple  The gods appeared before the architect, Pathos Verdes III, tasking him with the construction of a temple to house Pandora's Box. After building the temple, Cronos was forced to carry it on his back and wander the Desert of Lost Souls until the fierce desert winds ripped the flesh from his body. When called upon with the Titan Horn, he would have to allow warriors to climb upon him and journey through the temple. Following the deaths of his children, Pathos Verdes III grew more and more insane as he built the many traps and puzzles within the temple, eventually murdering his wife and committing suicide.The Birth of a Beast  Zeus, the King of Olympus, was famous for his numerous erotic escapades with other women. He was married to Hera, the Queen of Olympus, who bore him the God of War Ares and the Smith God Hephaestus. Before his marriage to Hera, Zeus had been married to the Titan Metis. After being informed of a prophecy by Gaia, which foretold that the\u00a0son of Metis would overthrow Olympus, Zeus turned Metis into a fly and swallowed her whole. She had already been gifted with a child however, who was born from the head of Zeus. This child came to be known as the goddess Athena. In Sparta, Zeus, together with a mortal woman named Callisto, became the father of two warriors, with the oldest one\u00a0being Kratos and\u00a0the youngest\u00a0one being Deimos. Callisto, however, was forbidden by Zeus to tell either child who their father was. Around this time, the\u00a0Oracle foretold that one of Zeus' sons, a \"Marked Warrior\", would one day rebel against Zeus and kill him. As Kratos' brother Deimos had been born with a strange birthmark, Zeus ordered Ares and Athena to abduct Deimos and bring him to Thanatos, the God of Death. Kratos attempted to save his brother, only for Ares to swat him aside, knocking him into a pile of wood. Enraged by the mortal's defiance, Ares drew his blade with the intention of killing the young Kratos, but Athena intervened, telling Ares that they had what they came for before apologizing to Kratos and departing back to the Heavens. The loss of his brother left an indelible mark on Kratos, as he vowed to never falter again. In honor of his brother, Kratos had himself tattooed in the exact image of Deimos' birthmark.Ares' Champion  As he grew older, Kratos became a fearsome and well-respected Spartan captain. However, during a fierce battle with the barbarians of the East, his life seemed destined for an early end. In a moment of desperation, Kratos called upon Ares, pledging himself to the God of War in return for the death of his foes. Seeing potential in the young warrior, Ares obliged, slaying the barbarians and giving Kratos the Blades of Chaos as a mark of his new allegiance. With his Spartan companions, Kratos (now a general) served Ares\u2019 will and slaughtered thousands of innocents in his name. Feeling Kratos could become far stronger by eliminating any weaknesses, Ares deceived his servant into burning down the village where Kratos\u2019 wife and child were present. Blinded by bloodlust, Kratos was warned by the Village Oracle that if he were to enter the main temple within the village, he would be haunted for the rest of his life. Ignoring her plea, Kratos entered the temple and killed everyone inside, including his wife and child. Kratos believed that his wife and child were back home in Sparta, and was thus horrified to see their corpses before him. Ares appeared before Kratos, revealing that it was he who had placed his family in the temple and that with nothing left in his way, he would become death incarnate. Kratos ignored Ares\u2019 arrogance and learned that he was tricked by the very god who once saved his life. The Village Oracle gathered the ashes of Kratos\u2019 loved ones and fastened them to his skin, permanently reminding him of the greatest sin he committed. Vengeful and despairing, Kratos' goal now was to serve Olympus and redeem himself, and in the future take his revenge upon Ares.Pursued by the Furies  For breaking his oath, Ares sent the Furies to capture Kratos and force him to once again serve the God of War. Kratos was trapped in an illusion of his home in Sparta, but Orkos appeared before him and encouraged him to see past the illusion, using Lysandra's necklace and ring as totem to discern reality from illusion. Though Kratos distrusted him, he followed Orkos' instruction to seek out Aletheia, the Oracle at Delphi. The Oracle was captured by Pollux and Castor, and Kratos took the Amulet of Uroborus from them after he killed them. Kratos traveled to the Harbor of Kirra where he encountered Orkos again. The oath keeper revealed that he is the son of Ares and Alecto. Ares wanted a perfect warrior who could help him overthrow Zeus, thus allowing Ares to rule Olympus for himself. Disappointed in Orkos, Ares disowned his son, and Orkos became the oath keeper of the Furies to please his mother. He explained that Kratos was the warrior Ares sought and for that reason, Ares helped Kratos against the barbarians. The murder of his family was meant to be one of three \"tests\" that would bind Kratos to Ares's will. Orkos did his bidding as the oath keeper and did not question the Furies until Ares tricked Kratos into killing his family. Armed with this knowledge, Kratos took a ship to Delos. Kratos arrives at the island of Delos and traverses a giant, ruined statue of Apollo. He is attacked by all three Furies and manages to cut off Megaera's arm, but Alecto uses her power to capture Kratos. Orkos appears and frees Kratos, taking him elsewhere upon the statue, with Alecto vowing that he will never succeed. After a perilous journey, Kratos uses the Amulet of Uroborus to fully restore the statue and retrieve the Eyes from the Lantern. Unfortunately, after completing the Trials of Archimedes, he is ambushed by the Furies once more, who take him captive and steal the Eyes and the Amulet. Over the next two weeks, Kratos is tortured by the Furies in the Prison of the Damned. He managed to free himself when Megaera went too far with her torture. He then pursued the Fury through the prison. She and Tisiphone attempted to misdirect him, as a building he enters is projected as a brothel. When he goes to sleep with a woman, he spots the ring on her finger and realizes that this is an illusion. Kratos tackles the woman, who is revealed to be Tisiphone. Megaera intervenes, however, insisting that Kratos belongs to her and releasing insects into Aegaeon's hands and mouth, thus mutating its prisoners into insect-titan hybrids. After Kratos killed Megaera and Aegeaon, retrieving the Amulet of Uroboros, Tisiphone creates an illusion of him being honored by the King of Sparta. But again, Kratos sees through it. He soon finds the Scribe of Hecatonchires, who reveals that both Ares and the Furies planned to overthrow Zeus. The Scribe was the first to be imprisoned by the Furies, and although they were originally fair in their punishment, they became ruthless under Ares' influence. Making his way to Alecto's chamber, Kratos manages to retrieve the Oath Stone from Tisiphone's pet bird, Daimon. But upon entering the chamber, the Furies project another illusion, this time of Kratos' home in Sparta. Kratos is nearly taken in by this, for he got to see his wife and daughter again. He grows close to sleeping with the image of Lysandra but notices the ring on her finger, instantly recognizing it to be an illusion. \"Lysandra\" is revealed to be Alecto, who tries to convince Kratos that he could live in this illusion if he rejoined Ares; however, noticing the Eyes of Truth hanging on her hip, he defiantly refused, preferring the truth to living a lie. Enraged, Alecto drops the illusion and threatens to execute him if he would not serve. Kratos breaks free of her sludge trap and manages to snatch the Eyes from Alecto, who retreats deeper into her sanctum before she realized they were gone. Tisiphone joined Alecto as Kratos advanced on the remaining Furies. They created an illusion of a massive whirlpool, with Alecto transforming into Caribdis the sea monster. Using the Eyes, Kratos broke through the Furies' illusions and forced Alecto back into her human form. As he advanced on the Fury Queen, Tisiphone dispatched Daimon against him but Kratos simply used the Eyes to destroy the bird. He proceeded to physically charge at Tisiphone, as she shapeshifted between the forms of the King and Kratos himself, belittling him. As he wrapped his hands around her throat, Tisiphone transformed into Lysandra, causing Kratos to briefly cease his assault before shrugging it off and continuing his onslaught. Tisiphone then changed into the Village Oracle, telling him that his family was not there that night he killed them by chance, before Kratos snapped her neck, killing her. With Alecto left for last, Kratos drew his blades. The Fury Queen coldly tells him that the truth would only bring him pain before he plunges his blades into her chest. With her last breath, Alecto spitefully promises that her death would change nothing before Kratos kills her. Kratos returned to his home in Sparta, where he was met by Orkos. Although praising Kratos' victory over the Furies, he reveals that he was remade the oath keaper once again, maintaining Kratos' bond to Ares. He begged Kratos to give him an honorable death, as it would free them both from the god, to which Kratos refused, proclaiming that no more innocent blood should be spilled. However, Orkos' continuing requests ultimately forced Kratos' hand. After killing Orkos, Kratos experienced the first of his many nightmares, previously masked by his bond to Ares: this was the price he had to pay for the truth. He also discovered his path to redemption through continual service to Olympus. Kratos proceeded to burn down his house, with the corpse of Orkos inside it.Servitude to the Gods  For ten years, Kratos served the Olympian gods, in hopes of gaining their forgiveness and releasing him from the nightmares of his past. In one notable instance, he was defending the city of Attica from a Persian assault when Helios was kidnapped from the sky by the freed Titan Atlas, who used the power of the sun to destroy the Pillar of the World. It was because of Persephone that Atlas was released from his torture, for she wanted nothing more than to be free of her miserable existence. Kratos saved the world by leaving his daughter in Elysium and destroying Persephone, who told him that he would never be free from his nightmares. He then enchained Atlas to uphold the world on his shoulders, where the mighty Titan claimed the two would meet again. Poseidon had been angered by the chaos and destruction left behind by the Hydra. As Kratos journeyed through the Aegean Sea, he noticed a massive shipwreck caused by the creature. He was called upon by the Sea God to rid the waters of the Hydra, granting him the ability of Poseidon's Rage, an attack that would create a devastating blow on the creature. Ares' jealousy towards Athena grew ever so strong, and he called upon the creatures of the Underworld to invade Athens. Zeus had forbidden the gods from waging war on each other and so Athena looked to Kratos for help. With her guidance, Kratos was given Medusa's Gaze from Aphrodite, Zeus' Fury from Zeus, the Blade of Artemis from Artemis, and the Army of Hades from Hades. Kratos retrieved Pandora\u2019s Box and used its power to become powerful enough to face Ares. Using the Blade of the Gods, Kratos managed to kill Ares once and for all. Although he was forgiven of his sins, the gods refused to free\u00a0 Kratos from the memories that haunted him. Knowing that he would never be free from his sins, Kratos attempted suicide by jumping from the peak of the highest mountain in Greece, until he was saved by Athena and granted Ares' now empty throne on Olympus.Kratos, New God of War  As the new god of war, Kratos was far more ruthless than Ares ever was. Kratos, still plagued by memories of his murdered family, grew fiercely bitter towards the gods for refusing to erase the memories of his past deeds and for their role in the capture and death of his brother, Deimos\u00a0and forcing him to kill his beloved mother Callisto. Thinking of the gods as pathetic and weak, he found solace by leading Sparta in conquering the rest of Greece. Upset by this very fact, the gods became enraged with Kratos\u2019 defiance and Zeus began to fear for his life. Athena tried to prevent Kratos from further destroying any more cities, warning him that the wrath of Olympus would soon present Kratos with the consequence of his actions. Ignoring her, Kratos helped his Spartan comrades take over the city of Rhodes.Zeus' Betrayal  As Kratos aided his Spartan army as the God of War, Zeus (in the form of an eagle) sapped Kratos of most of his power, causing him to shrink to the size of a mortal. Subsequently, Zeus transferred this power to the Colossus of Rhodes, bringing it to life. Zeus, feigning allegiance with Kratos, tricked him into draining the rest of his godly Powers into the Blade of Olympus. Kratos was rendered mortal, as Zeus revealed himself to have orchestrated the fight between the Colossus and Kratos, betraying him and killing him using the blade.Kratos' Rebellion  While in the Underworld, Kratos was faced by Gaia, who told him that the Titans would help overthrow Zeus, only if he were to journey to the Island of Creation and defeat the Sisters of Fate. Kratos escaped and rose once again, this time bent on revenge against Zeus.The Fate of Sparta  Zeus had gone to the Sisters earlier because of his paranoia involving Kratos\u2019 brutality. The Sisters told Zeus that Kratos was the son destined to overthrow him but that Zeus would be the victor in the end. Believing Kratos was dead, Zeus proceeded to destroy Sparta. Thinking that it was all over, he returned to his throne on Mount Olympus. Kratos learned of Sparta\u2019s fate via the Last Spartan, becoming enraged and continuing his journey to kill Zeus, more determined than ever.Battle with the Fates  The murals within the Hall of the Fates had depictions of their prophecies, both of the past and future. In one of the murals, the Olympians and the Titans were seen engaging in battle, which could either represent the original Titanomachy or the events of the Second Great War. In the second mural, a lone man, probably Kratos, stood amidst the destruction left behind. In the third mural, three men were walking towards a star in the sky, alluding the journey of the Three Wise Men towards the birth of Christ guided by the Star of Bethlehem. This represents the rise of Christianity after the downfall of Olympus and could signify that the Twilight of the Greek Gods occurred paving the way for the coming of Christ. After killing the Sisters, Kratos went back in time to the point where he was betrayed by Zeus. The Ghost of Sparta plunged himself at the king of the gods, and a great battle ensued. Arriving upon the Summit of Sacrifice, Kratos fought with great ferocity.Intervention  Using the Blade of Olympus, Kratos stabbed Zeus multiple times before being stopped by Athena. Protecting her father, she flung herself in front of Kratos and was stabbed instead. Zeus fled to Olympus while Kratos spoke with Athena. She revealed that he was Zeus' son and that a vicious cycle of revenge had been passed down by his bloodline. After she died, Kratos used the power of time to journey back to the final moments of the Great War, bringing the Titans with him to destroy the Gods once and for all.Second Titanomachy  The Second Titanomachy, also known as the second Great War, started with Zeus calling upon the Gods to discuss the events that had been occurring. He claimed that he would wipe out the plague created by Kratos and that the gods must unite to crush him. Olympus began to shake, and the Gods looked over the edge of the mountain. The Titans, led by Kratos, climbed towards the Olympians in hopes of destroying them. The Gods immediately responded to the threat of the Titans crawling up Mount Olympus. Helios, Hermes, Hercules, and Hades engaged the Titans head on, while Poseidon waits with Zeus. Overlooking the battle, Zeus saw the Titans and Gods were evenly matched.The King of the Gods thus decided to have Poseidon enter the fray. The God of Seas entered the battle, leaping off the top of Olympus, targeting the Titan Epimetheus. Hurled forward in a blast of water, Poseidon leaped right through Epimetheus' chest, killing him instantly and knocking him off the mountain into the waters below. With the help of his Hippocampi, which erupted from the water, Poseidon pulled at least one Titan off Mount Olympus before reaching Kratos and Gaia, in the form of a colossal watery construct. After a long and hard struggle, Kratos and Gaia combined their efforts, managing to kill the God of the Sea, with the Spartan gouging his eyes and snapping his neck. As Poseidon's corpse fell from Olympus, he began to disintegrate into a liquid mass and landed in the water. As a result of his death, the sea levels rose dramatically and massive waves ravaged the world, engulfing all but the highest mountain tops. Victorious from their battle with Poseidon, Kratos and Gaia reached Zeus, who then summoned a lightning bolt to blast them off the mountain, resulting in Kratos falling into the Underworld. In the Underworld, Kratos met with three Gods: a depressed Hephaestus, an infuriated Hades, and a spectral Athena. Eventually, Kratos reached Hades palace in the Underworld, leading to a fierce battle between the two. The battle reached its end when Kratos stole the Claws of Hades and used them to take Hades' soul, thereby releasing all of the dead souls from their torment.  The souls of the River Styx then attacked Hades, tearing a hole in his abdomen and leaving his corpse to rot underwater. After leaving the Underworld, Kratos met Helios, the God of the Sun, in the war-torn city of Olympia. Helios was still engaged in combat with the Titan Perses when Kratos reached the site of the battle. With the help of a Ballista, Kratos knocked Helios and his chariot into the grasp of Perses, who crushed and tossed the Sun God across the city. When Kratos found Helios, the gravely injured God appealed to Kratos to save him in exchange for any favor the Ghost of Sparta wanted, Kratos demanded to know the location of the Flame of Olympus, but Helios taunted him for his adamant desire to kill Zeus. When Kratos was about to beat him for answers, Helios called upon the power of the sun, temporarily blinding Kratos, but the latter managed to subdue Helios. In desperation, Helios attempted to trick Kratos into stepping into the Flame of Olympus, telling him that he would receive its power by doing so. Kratos wasn't fooled, as he had been told earlier by Hephaestus that the Flame was lethal to those who touch it, be they, man or god. Helios warned Kratos that his death would not lead him to Zeus, but Kratos had other ideas and decapitated the Sun God with his bare hands. Helios' decapitated head served Kratos as a weapon and a flashlight. The death of Helios resulted in the Sun being enshrouded by darkness and a torrential rainfall upon the world.  Kratos next encountered Hermes, taunting him with his super speed, and running up the Chain of Balance, after which Kratos followed. Eventually, Kratos caught up with Hermes, leading to a chase in which Kratos struggled to keep up. Through the use of a catapult, Kratos used his Blades of Exile to latch on to the catapult's stone as it hurled towards the statue of Athena where Hermes was perched, destroying the statue, putting Hermes off-balance and greatly weakening him. After a brief battle, another God fell, and with the death of Hermes, millions of insects flew from his disintegrating body, infecting the world, thus creating the Plague of Olympus. Kratos next encountered Hera and her step-son Hercules (Kratos' half-brother). After mercilessly beating Hercules to death, Kratos fell into the sewers. Emerging from the sewers, Kratos encountered Aphrodite in her chambers. She directed Kratos to a nearby portal, which he used to travel back to the Underworld, where he once again found Hephaestus.  Alarmed by the realization that Kratos was searching for Pandora herself, he sent Kratos on a suicide mission to find the Omphalos Stone in the hopes that Cronos would kill him. After a battle against the massive Titan, Cronos swallowed Kratos, who proceeded to break free using the Blade of Olympus, spilling his intestines in the process. Kratos returned to Hephaestus, who crafted the Nemesis Whip from the Omphalos Stone. He then found his end attempting to kill Kratos so that his daughter, Pandora, would be protected from him. Hera encountered Kratos within her gardens, and taunted him, saying his simple mind would not allow him to escape. He did, however, and after Hera goaded him even more, calling Pandora a \"little whore\", he snapped her neck. With the death of another Olympian, all the green life on at least Greece dies. While Kratos brought the Labyrinth to Olympus, Zeus awaited him. Both father and son dueled around the remains of Olympus, but Pandora eventually reached the Flame of Olympus, resulting in her death. Kratos, once again opened Pandora's Box, hoping to use its power against Zeus, but was disappointed and shocked to learn that nothing was inside the box, while the King of Gods laughed at his son's failure. After yet another arduous battle between the two, Kratos finally killed his father, beating him to death. With the death of the last Olympian, massive amounts of lightning left his body, and entered the sky, plunging the world into Chaos as well as the chains bound to the Gods were shattered from Kratos. With this, Ares' plan was complete: Kratos had become the perfect warrior, killed Zeus and destroyed the rule of Olympus. Athena then appeared and asked Kratos to give back the power of Hope, which he had unknowingly used to defeat Zeus. Instead, Kratos impaled himself with the Blade of Olympus, to give Hope to all the mortals of the world. Athena left, disappointed by Kratos's actions, and the rule of the Olympian gods came to an end. The rest of the\u00a0Gods left unscathed by Kratos' genocidal rampage (i.e. Apollo, Artemis, Dionysus, etc.) through unknown means were apparently either killed by the Titans or perished in the ensuing Chaos.Physical appearance  Many of the gods are indistinguishable from humans in appearance, though some look radically different. Also noteworthy is the fact that when a God dies, a catastrophic event occurs like an explosion or a devastating occurrence that is sometimes called a plague. The plague is based on what the god personifies like great flood of waters (Poseidon), deadly swarms of flies (Hermes), the sun being blocked out by the clouds in the sky (Helios), and the souls of the dead escaping (Hades). The weaker gods, like Ceryx, however, die without any major consequences, as do Hephaestus, Ares and Athena (the latter two of whom after their death only release a large explosion). However, it is possible that these events are not major enough to warrant much attention.Powers & Abilities  In addition to being immortal, the gods are superhuman beings. It's assumed that most of the gods in the God of War series possess the following: Some gods have specific powers that correlate to their Godly roles, as Zeus possesses projection and can conjure lightning, Poseidon can conjure and manipulate the element of water, and Hades possessing soul manipulation. It is unknown if the gods can resurrect those who have died. Some gods, like Zeus, Poseidon and Hades are considered the physically strongest, having immense powers compared to that of their ancestors. Others, like Ares, Athena, and Persephone, are somewhat weaker then their parents, but share similar levels in power. There are some minor, weaker Gods, like Ceryx or the Fire Steeds, that are considered servants to the Gods, and have no real power of their own but are still powerfully divine. While able to sustain great levels of damage, some Gods have been shown to die by injuries fatal to mortals. Athena died with a single stab of the Blade of Olympus, even though her father Zeus survived multiple impalements by the weapon, albeit Zeus was stronger than her to begin with, and the divine weapon was one of the few that gave the user the power to kill a God. The god Hephastus, however, died after being impaled upon his only anvil, which had apparently no special characteristics mystical or otherwise (though it can be assumed that Zeus stripped Hephastus of most of godly abilities). The Goddess Hera died by having Kratos break her neck. While this was a similar fate shared by her brother Poseidon, he was more vulnerable due to having fought both Kratos and Gaia. The increased vulnerability could also be due to the fact that Kratos possessed the Blade of Olympus, which could have rendered Poseidon's regenerative abilities useless in its presence. Probably Gods and Goddesses simply cease to exist if they are killed. Nevertheless, in some circustances they can ascend to the Astral Form after death. This is what happened to Athena and, for a short period of time, to Zeus. How and when a deity can continue his existence through this way is still unclear.The Olympian Gods  These are all the gods and goddesses who appear and/or are mentioned in the God of War series:Olympians Pre-Olympian Gods Demigods Trivia Zeus  Zeus (Greek: \u0396\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2) was the youngest child of the Titan King Cronos, who ascended to become the King of Olympus and the God of the Sky, Thunder, Lightning, and the Heavens. He acted as an ally in God of War and also served as the main antagonist of both God of War II and God of War III, and was the biological father of most of the gods of Olympus and many famous demigods such as Hercules, Perseus, Peirithous and even the Spartan warrior Kratos as well as his brother Deimos.Greek Mythology  In Greek Mythology, Zeus was the King of the Gods, ruler of Olympus, and God of the Sky, Heavens, and Lightning. Zeus was youngest of his six siblings. His symbols were the Lightning bolt, the Eagle, the Oak Tree and the Bull. Zeus was the youngest son of Cronos\u00a0and Rhea. He was very well known for his erotic escapades with beautiful mortal women, resulting in many godly and heroic offspring, including Athena, Apollo, Artemis, Hermes, Persephone, Dionysus, Perseus, Hercules, Helen and Minos. When the loss of his older siblings by their father Cronos became too great for Rhea to bare any longer, she hid him from Cronos far away, giving him a stone to swallow instead. Once grown, the young God sought to free his siblings and overthrow his father. Disguised as a cup-bearer, Zeus mixed a brew into Cronos' wine, causing him to vomit up the stone that had taken his place, and then his siblings. Overthrowing the Titans, Zeus castrated Cronos and banished him to Tartarus. Later drawing lots with his brothers Poseidon and Hades to determine who would rule the skies, oceans, and the Underworld, Zeus won the sky, and became the King of Olympus. Some sources claim that Zeus is technically the eldest, due to being the only child to not be kept from the world and trapped in their father's stomach, though this is disputable, and some claim fabricated by Zeus himself to lend validity to his claim to the sky before he and his brothers decided to draw lots. His counterpart in Roman Mythology is Jupiter and was known as Ba'al Hadad to the Canaanites/Israelites.In the God of War Series Birth  During the reign of the Titans, Cronos\u00a0was informed of a prophecy foretelling his eventual downfall at the hands of one of his own sons. To prevent this fate, Cronos swallowed all of his children, one by one. When Zeus was born, his mother Rhea\u00a0was distraught at the loss of her first five children and devised a trick to save him by letting an eagle carry the baby Zeus to safety, while he was replaced by a stone wrapped in cloth\u00a0which Cronos devoured, having mistaken it for Zeus. The eagle then carried the infant Zeus to Gaia\u00a0so that he would be raised and blessed with the strength to stand up to Cronos. During this time, Zeus developed a deep hatred for his father, and looked forward to the day he would finally release his siblings; one of Zeus' drawings inside Gaia portray him opening Cronos' belly and setting them free.\u00a0The Great War  As he came of age, Zeus decided to put his plans into action. Zeus freed his siblings and\u00a0declared war on all of the Titans, thus betraying Gaia. The new rulers of the world, the Gods, calling themselves Olympians, fought against their predecessors with great ferocity and power. The battle between the Gods and the Titans formed the landscape of the mortal world, shaking the earth with massive earthquakes and crumbling mountains. To end the war, Zeus created the all-powerful Blade of Olympus, which was used to banish the Titans to the foulest pits of Tartarus. However, the Evils borne from the war posed another threat to Olympus, so Zeus commissioned Hephaestus, the Smith God, to build Pandora's Box in order to house the Evils. Unbeknownst to him, Athena called forth a power that transcended any God, Hope, and placed it inside the box to counteract the Evils should the box ever be opened. When Zeus asked Hephaestus where to hide the box, the Smith God suggested that it should be placed on the back of Cronos. Using the architect Pathos Verdes III, he constructed an enormous temple to house the box and then chained it to the Titan's back, sentencing him to wander the Desert of Lost Souls for all eternity. Little did the great Zeus know that the events that had just transpired would eventually doom him.After the Great War  At some point, Zeus had an affair with a mortal woman named Callisto. The circumstances are unknown, but the affair resulted in two sons. The oldest one was Kratos, a mighty warrior with unstoppable rage and ambition. Hera, displeased with Zeus for fathering yet another illegitimate child and (correctly) predicting that his existence would eventually doom Olympus, demanded that he kill the boy immediately after his birth. Zeus, at this point still a somewhat benevolent and caring figure, took pity on the child and refused. Around the same time, however, the\u00a0Oracle foretold that one of Zeus' sons, a \"marked warrior\", would rise up against the King of the Gods and kill him. Noticing the strange birthmarks on the youngest son of Zeus and Callisto, Deimos, he sent Ares and Athena to Sparta in order to capture the boy and bring him to Thanatos. Later on in Kratos' life, having brutally slain his own family in blind anger due to a scheme by Ares, the newly christened \"Ghost of Sparta\" pledged to serve the Gods of Olympus, including his father Zeus, in the hopes that they would relieve him of his nightmares. This can be compared to the fate of his half-brother Hercules, who had also killed his family in a madness caused by Hera. About halfway through Kratos' penance, Zeus was one of the many Gods that fell victim to an enchanted slumber, orchestrated by Morpheus when the Sun God, Helios, was kidnapped by the Titan Atlas. Kratos eventually discovered that this was the work of Persephone, who intended to use the Sun God to empower\u00a0Atlas in order to destroy the Pillar of the World and bring an end to all life, as well as her own suffering. Fortunately for Zeus and the other gods, Kratos was able to defeat the Queen of the Underworld and save Helios, returning him to the sky and forcing Morpheus to retreat. What they did not know was that Kratos had been forced to relinquish any hopes of reuniting with his beloved daughter in the process of saving the world, pushing his disillusionment with the Gods ever closer to open hatred and rebellion. Near the end of Kratos' service, Ares besieged the city of Athens in the hopes of gaining Zeus' favor over his sister, Athena. Zeus, having forbidden the Gods from waging war on each other and fearing the possibility that Ares might be the \"Marked Warrior\" who would overthrow Zeus, allowed Athena to receive help from Kratos. Athena told him that killing Ares would complete his penance and rid him of his past sins. During his quest, Kratos met Zeus himself within the damaged city of Athens, where he was given Zeus' Fury, the ability to wield and throw powerful lighting bolts. In addition, Zeus took on the mortal guise of a Grave Digger and created a portal to the Underworld via a grave he claimed to be digging for Kratos, allowing the Spartan to escape the realm of the dead (after Ares impaled the Spartan with a pillar) late in his adventure. Retrieving Pandora's Box from Kratos' dead corpse, Ares yelled to the skies, cursing his father for constantly favoring Athena and asking Zeus if he could finally see what his son was capable of. Ares declared that he would not hesitate to use the Box against Olympus itself, only for Kratos to return from the Underworld and use a bolt of Zeus' Fury to reclaim it. Kratos opened the ancient artifact and harnessed its power to kill Ares, his former master. Zeus and the Gods guided Kratos to kill Ares, as they had incorrectly believed that he was the only real threat to Olympus. The Olympians rewarded Kratos by forgiving him for the crime of killing his own family (although, to Kratos' dismay, they were unable to remove the horrible memories from his mind), and made him the new God of War.Zeus' Betrayal  It was believed that Deimos is the Marked Warrior so it is very possible that Deimos' death and Kratos' destructive and aggressive behaviour led Zeus into believing that Kratos is the Marked Warrior who would seek revenge against the Gods of Olympus and one day destroy them. Another moment which led Zeus betray Kratos is when Kratos told Athena that the Gods would pay for that... Even though Kratos did not know that the grave digger was actually Zeus, he was there when Kratos exclaimed these words. Later on in Rhodes, Zeus tricked Kratos, told him to cast his powers into the Blade of Olympus and with that act, Zeus found a way to take it and kill Kratos as long as his powers would not be inside Kratos himself. It is later revealed that Zeus and the other Gods had fallen prey to the Evils locked away in Pandora's Box after Kratos opened it to kill Ares. Apparently, Zeus didn't realize that if Kratos used the Box, the Evils would be released onto them; he had instead hoped that the Evils would fuel Kratos. As a result, Zeus was overwhelmed by his personal plague: Fear. Overcome with extreme paranoia and frightened by Kratos' increasingly destructive behavior, Zeus soon realized that Kratos would be the one to perpetuate the cycle of son killing father. Just as Cronos killed Ouranus, and as Zeus himself defeated Cronos, the King of the Gods expected that Kratos, infuriated by the revelation that not even the Gods could end his nightmares, would kill Zeus. Zeus' fears were further exacerbated by Kratos' open defiance of the other Gods, ignoring their demands that he cease his relentless conquest and destruction of Greece. During Kratos' attack on Rhodes, Zeus devised a scheme that would put an end to Kratos' reign. He disguised himself as an eagle and drained a portion of the new God of War's power, transferring it to the Colossus of Rhodes. This caused the statue to come alive and attack the now mortal-sized Kratos, who initially believed that Athena was the one who betrayed him. Zeus further took advantage of the situation by tricking Kratos into infusing the rest of his god powers into the Blade of Olympus, the weapon that brought an end to the Great War of the Gods and Titans. Upon doing so, Kratos destroyed the Colossus with ease, but was crushed under the crumbling statue's hand soon afterwards, weakening the Spartan to the brink of death. Thus, in order to survive, he needed to retrieve the Blade, which had been knocked out of his grasp by the falling Colossus. As Kratos was about to reach the Blade, Zeus finally revealed himself, admitting responsibility to Kratos for everything that had just transpired. Zeus claimed that his motivation was to \"undo Athena's mistake\" (presumably the act of making Kratos a God) and prevent Ares' fate from becoming his own. The King of the Gods then ordered the Spartan to submit, but an outraged Kratos refused, causing Zeus to stab him with the Blade of Olympus. As Kratos slowly died, Zeus expressed his disappointment in Kratos, insisting that the Spartan warrior had made the wrong choice. However, Kratos continued to insult the King of Olympus, and Zeus responded by stabbing him with the Blade again, telling his son that the cycle\u00a0has come to an end, and everything that he ever knew would now suffer because of his sacrilege. Zeus then destroyed all of the soldiers present, while a dying Kratos promised that he would have his revenge as Zeus leaves and casts Kratos into the Underworld. Upon leaving Rhodes, Zeus proceeded to destroy Sparta not only because the Spartan people worshipped Kratos, but to further punish Kratos himself. After destroying Sparta, Zeus believed he finally dealt with Kratos and returned to his throne on Mount Olympus.Kratos' Revenge  Unfortunately for Zeus, Kratos was far from finished. Aided by Gaia and the Titans, he returned to life, journeyed to the Island of Creation, and killed the Sisters of Fate. With the Power of Time itself at his command, Kratos returned to the moment when Zeus tried to stab him with the Blade of Olympus, emerging from a portal and knocking the off-guard God King to the ground. Surprised at this development, Zeus presumed that the Sisters of Fate had unexpectedly aided him. Kratos, pulling the Blade of Olympus from his past self, told Zeus that the Sisters were dead. The King of Olympus declared that he had underestimated Kratos but will not make the same mistake again and the two combatants charged towards one another, taking to the skies as they fought. They ended up on the Summit of Sacrifice, where an epic battle began. Kratos fought Zeus furiously and managed to deliver several powerful blows, as he stated he would kill Zeus for his actions. Enraged at his defiance, Zeus unleashed his full might on the vengeful warrior in the form of a deadly electrical storm. Unable to overpower the furious god, Kratos resorted to military tactics, a feigned surrender that Kratos knew would immediately stop the onslaught. Kneeling in front of the Blade of Olympus he asked Zeus to end his life and release him from his torment. Granting what he thought was Kratos' final request, Zeus agreed to release him from his life, but insisted that his torment was just beginning. The Great God was tricked, however, and the Spartan, using the Golden Fleece to deflect a small remainder of Zeus' lighting, overpowered and took the Blade from Zeus, pinning both of his arms to a rock and began to impale Zeus with the Blade of Olympus, intending to kill him the same way he did to him until Athena intervened. Zeus took this opportunity to free himself, warning the Spartan that he had started a war he had no hope of winning. Zeus then attempted to flee, but Kratos immediately pushed Athena aside taking the Blade to make one more attempt on the severely weakened Zeus. However, Athena jumped in the way at the last second, sacrificing herself to save her father who took the moment to flee. Kratos was far more affected by Athena's death than Zeus, who coldly ignored her and narrowly escaped back to Mount Olympus though he did express concern for her later. Just before she died, Athena told Kratos that he was compelled to kill Zeus just as Zeus did to Cronos, for Kratos was Zeus' son. This was the cycle Zeus had mentioned when he killed Kratos before. Declaring that no son should ever destroy his own father (ignoring the fact that Zeus had already done the same to his own father), Athena told Kratos that Zeus must live so that Olympus would prevail. God after God would deny Kratos his vengeance, for they would protect Zeus for the sake of Olympus. Watching the fallen Athena disintegrate, Kratos felt betrayed yet again and, using the Loom Chamber, he returned to the first Great War urging the Titans to accompany him back to his own time, where a wounded Zeus had fled back to Mount Olympus.The Second Great War  After the events of God of War II, Zeus returned to Olympus and told Poseidon, Hades, Hermes, and Helios about Kratos' intentions, telling them that they have to unite once more to preserve Olympus. When they saw the Titans ascending the mountain, the Gods immediately took action, while Zeus remained out of the front lines, likely still weak after his encounter with Kratos. After witnessing the death of his brother, Poseidon, the King of the Gods decided to join the battle, with his Aegis being armed. As Kratos\u00a0and Gaia reached the platform where Zeus was waiting for them, the Spartan approached the King of the Gods, telling his father that he could no longer hide behind Athena for safety. Zeus then chided his son by insisting that it was his blind rage that caused Athena's death, asking the Spartan how far he was willing to go to have his revenge. The Ghost of Sparta replied by listing his previous battles before stating that nothing would stand in his way and that he would stop have his revenge. Infuriated with Kratos' defiance, The King of the Gods then decided to strike both Kratos and Gaia with his thunderbolts, thinking that they would both fall into the River Styx. Although Kratos did fall into the River Styx, he nevertheless survived and fought his way back to the top of Mount Olympus, destroying even more Gods and his son Hercules along the way. Zeus later indirectly encountered his son through one of Pandora's Statues, warning him to stay away from Pandora. He would not encounter Kratos in person again until he raised the Labyrinth, thereby destroying much of the inner sanctum of Mount Olympus. He attempted to stop Pandora from entering The Flame of Olympus while disparaging Kratos both for his obsession with Pandora and all of the destruction he has caused. They soon engaged in another fight, destroying more of Olympus' inner chambers. Their battle was interrupted when Pandora made another attempt to jump into the Flame. Kratos managed to grab her, but Pandora insisted to Kratos that he needed to let her go. Zeus, however, warned that he must not let her into the Flame, telling the Spartan that for once in his \"pathetic life\" he cannot fail like he failed in protecting his family. This inadvertently caused Kratos to let go of Pandora and attack Zeus in blind fury. With the Flame gone, Kratos saw and opened Pandora's Box, only to discover that it was empty. Zeus mocked his own son, stating that in spite of all his efforts, they ended in yet another \"stunning failure\", laughing his words further drove Kratos to the brink of madness. Zeus then retreated outside to the same dias that Kratos and Gaia confronted him on earlier, with Kratos following closely behind.\u00a0 The King of the Gods observes all of the destruction his son has caused to the world, telling him that he would have much to do once their battle is over. They fight each other again until they are interrupted by Gaia, who was thought to have been killed by Kratos. She returned to kill both her grandson for vengeance and her great-grandson for destroying her world, ignoring the fact that it was the death of the Olympians that caused it and that it would have happened anyway if the Titans had won. Zeus told Gaia that her pawn has failed her, and commented that she should have chosen the other one (probably referring to Deimos).\u00a0Gaia then decided to crush the platform, declaring that father and son would die together. Both of them managed to enter the large chest wound she incurred earlier from her fight with Poseidon, making their way to her heart. There the fight raged on with both using Gaia's Heart to heal themselves in the battle. Eventually, Gaia was killed when Kratos impaled Zeus against her heart with the Blade of Olympus, which apparently also killed Zeus. Gaia's body slowly broke apart and destroyed most of Mount Olympus. Regaining consciousness, Kratos retrieved the Blade of Olympus from Zeus' \"corpse\", but when he tries to leave, he is attacked by Zeus' still active spirit, which taking away all of his magic and equipment except for the Blade of Olympus, the Blades of Exile, and the Boots of Hermes, infecting him with Fear. Kratos was thought to be finished, but with the help of Pandora's spirit, Kratos managed to forgive his sins and unleash Hope\u00a0from within himself. He then briefly battled Zeus' astral form, eventually forcing it to retreat back to his body, reviving Zeus. Kratos considered of attacking him with his blades but paused and realized that Zeus was so weak he could kill him with his bare hands. He then threw his blades aside and charged at Zeus.Death  Terrified, Zeus backed away and tried to stop Kratos with his arms, but was unable to resist the Spartan's fury and was thrown against a rock. A black smoke (presumably Fear) escaped from Zeus' mouth, possibly meaning that the Fear had finally left Zeus. Kratos then begins to beat Zeus uncontrollably, kicking him in the face and throwing him against rocks, ultimately grabbing Zeus' beard and beating him to a bloody pulp. Interestingly enough, Zeus does not put up any resistance when the black smoke left his body. It is possible that he realized that by causing Kratos so much pain, he was responsible for his own demise. Zeus' body disintegrated and exploded in a huge blast of light, unleashing absolute chaos upon the world, and with this, the King of Olympus was no more, thus ending the reign of the Olympian Gods.God of War (2018)  Even many years following his death, Zeus still haunts Kratos. After Kratos defeats the Bridge Keeper of Helheim, he soon sees the image of Zeus in the sky calling to him. Kratos, surprised by the sudden arrival of his father, reveals to Mimir that he was Zeus' son. Kratos asks Mimir what that place was and how it's possible for the former King of Olympus to be there. Mimir tells Kratos to never venture there and that Helheim is known for torturing those with memories of the past with illusions. Later on in Hel, Kratos hears the past echos of Zeus speaking to him, which he ignores but would later see, along with Atreus, a ghostly reenactment of Zeus' final moments before his death, being beaten to death by Kratos. Afterwards, Kratos tells his son of how he killed his own father as Atreus realizes the specter was his grandfather. Atreus was surprised by his father's demigod status and of his past but was otherwise unfazed.Multiplayer  Zeus is one of the four mentors of God of War: Ascension's Multiplayer. His statue is the third one in the Rotunda of Olympus, staying right at the center of his brother's statues and face-to-face to any warrior who arrives at it.Overview  The king of Olympus' warriors\u00a0have the average physical powers and resistance from the game, but are the best in elemental damage. Their magic attacks, which come from the mighty lightning of Olympus, are incredibly strong, usually hitting opponents many times in deadly shocks and can disable some of their abilities for a short period when used. A warrior of Zeus must count mainly on his magic bar against his enemies. Their electric attacks can overpower warriors and beasts in seconds.Battle Mage  Impressive elemental powers.Electric Magic  Stun opponents and disable enemy magics.Zeus Items  Improve defense and escape.Zeus Weapons  Can shock enemies in electric currents or strong explosions in some special attacks.Zeus Armors  Focus on enhancing elemental powers and defenses.Personality  Zeus' benevolent side was more prevalent in the original God of War, in which he was depicted as a caring god who sought to punish evildoers and oath-breakers, even empathizing with his son Kratos' (who at that time was unaware Zeus was his father) grievances against Ares despite all of the terrible things Kratos had done. Even though he had a benevolent side, he had some negativity within him as he placed a curse on his lover (and Kratos' mother) Callisto to transform into a grotesque monster should she ever reveal his relation to Kratos or Deimos, he also feared Deimos to the point of imprisoning and torturing him for eternity due to The Marked Warrior prophecy. After Kratos opened Pandora's box, he was possessed by one of the evils in the box: fear. This transformed Zeus into a cruel, wrathful, paranoid, and power-hungry deity, as evidenced by how he started treating the innocent Pandora with cruelty. The evils of the box also caused Zeus to develop an intense fear of Kratos, whom he now realized was the \"Marked Warrior\" foretold in the Oracle's prophecy that would perpetuate the cycle of patricide which led to Zeus overthrowing his own father Cronos. Witnessing his ruthless murder of the Furies along with Ares, Thanatos, and Persephone, Zeus' fears were further exacerbated by Kratos' intense hatred for the other gods of Olympus (with Hephaestus, Athena, and Aphrodite being the only obvious exceptions) and his destructive rampages across Greece during his reign as God of War. In response, Zeus took the form of an eagle and siphoned off a large portion of Kratos' godhood powers, infusing them into the Colossus of Rhodes. He then tricked Kratos into transferring the rest of his powers into the Blade of Olympus, weakening him to the point of near-death before finishing him off for good. To prevent his followers from helping their fallen god and to punish Kratos even more, Zeus destroyed Sparta, killing hundreds of innocent people in the process. Not even his own family were safe, as he used them as mere pawns in his war against Kratos and the Titans, mourning little (if at all) about the losses of Athena (who tried to protect him, giving him a chance to escape Kratos' wrath the first time), Poseidon, Hades, Helios, Hermes, Hercules, possibly Hephaestus (even though he brutally beat him to a pulp on learning of his deception after being infected), and Hera, his wife. But when the evils that possessed him left his body, he somehow let himself get beaten by his son, implying that he finally realized that his persecution and fear of Kratos created a self-fulling prophecy. He was also unfaithful to Hera, having\u00a0cheated on his wife countless times and fathering many bastard children (including Kratos, Hercules and Deimos). He seemed to care very little about the well being of his\u00a0own children, going as far as to dispose of his own sons Hephaestus and Kratos, caring very little to not at all for Ares' (whose destructive behaviour feared him) death and imprisoning\u00a0Deimos out of fear of being dethroned.Appearance  Zeus appears as an old muscular white-haired man. His eyes are pure white, best seen in the cutscene in God of War II in which he kills Kratos. In his neutral, unaltered form he appears to stand well over 7 feet when compared to the already especially tall Kratos. In God of War II and in the opening scene of God of War III he wears white toga and golden arm guards, but after the start of the Second Titanomachy he replaces his toga with a golden side guard, possibly the Aegis of Zeus, that had similar powers to the Golden Fleece.Powers & Abilities  As the King of Olympus, Zeus is the most powerful of all the Olympians, more so than even his brothers\u00a0Poseidon and Hades. His power is great enough to challenge Kratos to a greater degree than any other God.Gallery  See Zeus/GalleryVideos  Part 1Part 2Trivia Related Pages Kratos' Weapons  The following are Kratos' weapons used throughout the series.Aphrodite  Aphrodite is the Olympian Goddess of Love and Beauty, and one of the many supporting characters in the God of War series.Greek Mythology  In Greek mythology, Aphrodite is the goddess of Love, Beauty, Seduction, Pleasure, and Happiness. There is more than one story about her origins. According to Hesiod's Theogony, she was born when Cronus cut off Uranus's genitals and threw them into the sea, and she arose from the sea foam (aphros). According to Homer's Iliad, she is the daughter of Zeus and Dione. Because of her beauty, other gods feared that their rivalry over her would interrupt the peace among them and lead to war, so Zeus married her to Hephaestus, who, because of his ugliness and deformity, was not seen as a threat. Aphrodite had many lovers - both gods, such as Ares, and men, such as Anchises. One day, the sun god Helios caught Ares and Aphrodite in their affair. When he told Hephaestus, the smith god decided to plan his revenge. He created an invisible net, which he set over the marriage bed. No sooner had Hephaestus left their home, that Aphrodite called her lover and Ares snuck into the house and in bed with the naked goddess; but, just in the midst of their lovemaking, the net fell upon the two lovers, trapping and immobilizing them, locked in a very private embrace. Hephaestus immediately walked back to his bedchamber with a host of other gods and exhibited them as they were naked and wrapped in each other's arms. Her Roman equivalent is Venus.In the God of War Series God of War  Aphrodite appeared in the first game in the city of Athens, presenting one of the tasks Kratos must pass: killing Medusa by decapitating her, and using her gaze as a weapon. Once the task is complete Kratos must then use the gaze to turn a few minotaurs into stone. She then allows Kratos to pass and continue his quest.God of War III  Aphrodite was seen in bed, with her handmaidens, but when she sees Kratos, she tells them to leave. She attempts to seduce Kratos, telling him, \"Even though you are no longer the God of War, you can still share my bed.\" But Kratos was not amused. Annoyed, she reveals how she yearns for a \"real man\" to meet her, but since Zeus refused to let the imprisoned Daedalus finish the bridge, she has not had her wish granted and she expressed how much she dislikes Hephaestus. That's when she realizes that Kratos needs those bridges fixed and tells him that she might give him information only if Kratos pleases her (he must have sex with her). If he does, Kratos would be given Red Orbs. While having sex with her, the handmaidens say Kratos has \"such power\" and later they begin making love, as well. Aphrodite wanted Kratos to have sex with her again, but an impatient Kratos refused. Irritated, Aphrodite tells Kratos to go to Hephaestus for help instead. It is unknown if Aphrodite or her handmaidens were able to escape the palace when Gaia's giant corpse destroyed all of Olympus.Powers and Abilities  As the Goddess of Love, Aphrodite possessed many powers.Personality  She seems to have a very carefree, yet promiscuous outlook on life. In fact, the only thing she cares about is having sex, and is actively neutral in the war Kratos is waging against the gods. This promiscuous nature seems more to do with the fact that she is the Goddess of Love, Beauty, Sexuality and Procreation, than it does with the opening of Pandora's Box. But after it was opened, the evils Lust/Vanity completely took possession of her which made the already sex loving goddess even more promiscuous than ever indeed. She loves making love rather than do anything else. Her only benchmark, it seems, for having intercourse with someone is whether or not she finds the man attractive enough to sleep with her. It is implied by her handmaidens that she is difficult to fully please sexually, due to her having so much experience in the matter (it's also most likely that she prefers having sexual intercourse with men, but since the bridges were nearly destroyed the only way to please her were her handmaidens). She was surprised when Kratos is able to nearly make her lose her composure with his own experience.Appearance  Aphrodite is considered to be flawlessly beautiful. She has long, auburn hair kept in a braid and pale blue eyes. Though she has in this new lifetime hazel brown eyes, hiding the pale blue that truly is her eye-color. Her body can be considered \"perfect\" since she is the Goddess of Love, Beauty, and Sexuality. She wears a revealing dress that exposes her perfectly sized and formed breasts (most likely to sexually appeal to mortals) and is barefoot.Trivia Hades  Hades was the Olympian\u00a0God of the Underworld. He is\u00a0surpassed in eminence only by his brothers, Zeus and Poseidon although it is possible that Hades is considered equal to Poseidon.\u00a0He is the oldest son of the Titans Cronos and Rhea and husband of Persephone. He was also a minor supporting character in God of War and a major antagonist in God of War III  where he was eventually confronted by his nephew, who after a fierce duel, tore off the god's helmet before killing him by absorbing his soul with his own weapons.Greek Mythology  Hades was the ancient Greek god of the Underworld and the brother of Zeus, but his name was shared with the abode of the dead. In Greek Mythology, Hades was the first son and fourth child of Cronos and Rhea. According to myth, he along with his younger brothers Zeus and Poseidon defeated the Titans in battle and took over rulership of the cosmos; ruling the Underworld, Sky, and Sea, respectively; the solid earth, the long province of Gaia, was available to all three concurrently. He was also called \"Plouton\" (Greek: meaning \"Rich One\"), a name which the Romans Latinized as Pluto. The Romans would associate Hades/Pluto with their own chthonic gods, Dis Pater and Orcus. The corresponding Etruscan god was Aita and the corresponding Canaanite god was Mot. Symbols associated with him are the Helm of Darkness and the three-headed dog, Cerberus.In the God of War Series The First Titanomachy  Hades appears in cutscenes in God of War II, during the Great War, when the Gods defeated the Titans. He is seen fighting his father Cronos trying to take Cronos's soul until Atlas comes and uses a ground attack on Hades to save Cronos. This causes Hades to turn his attention to Atlas and with his brother Poseidon coming to help him Hades is able to take Atlas's soul placing it within him thus defeating the Titan leader. After the Titanomachy he becomes a prominent figure among the Gods as there is a statue of him in the Garden of the Gods along with Athena, Ares, Zeus, Helios, and Poseidon. At the end of the game he is seen with Poseidon, Helios and Hermes standing in front of Zeus, before the second Great War (when Kratos uses the Loom of Fate to rescue the Titans before they were defeated and imprisoned in the first Great War) begins.Wager of the Gods  In the comics, Hades is seen in flashbacks competing in the wager of the Gods, a contest in which Gods choose various mortals as their champions, with the goal being the capture of the healing elixir known as Ambrosia. Hades chose Alrik, a warrior who sought to capture the Ambrosia in order to save his ill father, as his champion. After which, in fear that Kratos may best his champion, Hades sent a torrent of great fires from the sky onto Kratos' army. He was still able to kill Kratos. After Alrik was defeated by Kratos and torn apart by Rocs, Hades revived him and sent him to destroy the Spartan who defied him. After being saved from death, Alrik then discovered that his beloved father had died, and so, the new Barbarian King vowed to exact vengeance on Kratos.Kratos' Tiring of Ares  In God of War: Ascension, Ares, the God of War, sent The Furies to capture Kratos and imprison him in a Titan-sized prison for the living damned, where he is tortured for months on end, driven insane, and constantly haunted by the visions of the night he lost everything dear to him. Fueled by a desire for revenge against Ares, along with a need to redeem himself among Hades to earn salvation, Kratos manages to break free of his imprisonment and sets out on a journey to kill the Furies. If he can successfully defeat them he can sever all ties to Ares without consequence.Persephone's Betrayal  In God of War: Chains of Olympus, one of the final challenges is called Challenge of Hades. Hades himself does not appear, although Kratos does enter his realm of the dead, the Underworld. Hades does, however, play a background role, as husband to Persephone, the main antagonist of the game. Persephone doesn't love him but is forced to remain in his dark realm. Because of this, she had chosen to end both her life and that of the Gods by freeing Atlas and commanding him to kidnap Helios, the God of the Sun, from the sky and use his power to destroy the Pillar of the World.Aiding Kratos  In God of War, he manifests in Pandora's Temple in a translucent form, like the other gods, and gives Kratos a magic called the Army of Hades. Only his fiery, demonic face is seen. There is also a giant statue of him in the section of the Temple called The Challenge of Hades, as well as another statue of Hades alongside Zeus and Poseidon in Pandora's Box's Elevator.Moving in Shadows  While Hades doesn't appear in Betrayal, he is, again, a background character. When Kratos starts chasing the mysterious Assassin, the Undead Legionnaires and Cerberus appear from Underworld to stop him. Kratos wondered why Hades sent these beasts to attack him, speculating that Hades is the one who is plotting to ruin Kratos' relationship with the other gods. This would have made sense since Hades already had a legitimate reason to hate Kratos for the death of his wife Persephone. (Note: Betrayal is not considered part of the canon.)The Second Titanomachy  Hades is first seen amongst the congregation of Gods on Mount Olympus, dropping down to join Hermes and Helios in the battle against the Titans saved and led by Kratos scaling the mountain. He is briefly seen dislodging his uncle Oceanus from the mountain after Kratos disabled one of the Leviathans attacking Gaia. Kratos encounters Hades personally in the Underworld, who seeks to prevent him from escaping again. After first entering, Hades periodically comments Kratos' actions, often in a sarcastic, humorous or taunting tone of voice. As soon as Kratos enters his Palace, Hades takes a more hostile stand, claiming he senses \"some bad blood\" between them. Before the battle, Hades reminds Kratos how he has wronged him in the past, by killing Athena\u00a0(his niece), by killing Poseidon\u00a0(his brother), and especially Persephone, his wife and \"Beautiful Queen\". Hades then threatens, \"I will see you suffer as I have suffered! Your soul is mine!\". Emerging from the darkness, Hades immediately attempts to steal Kratos' soul but fails. An intense battle ensues, during which Kratos and Hades do battle with their respective chain blades. Eventually, the blades become entangled, and Hades attempted to pull Kratos into the River Styx. Eventually, Kratos gains the upper hand and uses both weapons to form a noose around Hades' neck, repeatedly slamming his uncle's head into the ceiling and knocking him into the River Styx seemingly killing him. From this, Kratos obtains the Claws of Hades allowing him to steal souls. Eventually, a significantly bigger Hades bursts out of the river using the soul to maintain him self, no longer sporting his helmet, revealing a deformed, devilish, cracked skull. After a fierce duel Kratos manages to rip out his soul, using his own Claws killing the God of the Underworld once and for all. As Hades' rule of the Underworld lifts, the tormented souls of the Styx swarm over Hades, dragging him into the depths of the river. Kratos, in possession of Hades' soul, is now free to traverse the River Styx unharmed. After diving into the river, the godly possession, Hades' helmet, can be retrieved at the bottom, near the point of entry. It then becomes available during Bonus Play. Before leaving, Hades' corpse can be seen at the bottom of the Styx, mutilated, as the tormented souls tore a passage through his gut to escape the river. Swimming through Hades' now open torso, Kratos follows them and returns to The Forge of Hephaestus, the Blacksmith God. Hephaestus asks how Kratos could be alive and if \"Lord Hades\" rules no longer, to which Kratos responds, \"The God of the Underworld is dead!\" Hephaestus is shocked by this and states that he thought that the death of Hades was impossible, to which Kratos responds, \"Olympians overestimate themselves.\" Hephaestus replied, \"I will keep that in mind, Spartan\".Multiplayer  Hades is one of the four god mentors of God of War: Ascension's Multiplayer. His statue is the second one in the Rotunda of Olympus.Overview  Warriors\u00a0aligned to Hades have great physical powers (being rivaled only by warriors of Ares)\u00a0and\u00a0increased cooldown reduction, too, but lack defenses (again, only being less weak than Ares). But these are not their best advantages: being considered the best Multiplayer allegiance many times, the secret of these warriors is their ability to steal health from enemies and specialty in escape and stealth techniques. A particular item offered by the Underworld God is Hades' Helmet, which allows players to stay invisible from other players for some time. Warriors of Hades are literally the living nightmare to anyone from the opponent team when fighting seriously, and must focus on using surprise attacks in order to have an advantage in battle. Before taking strong blows, they can use their items to perform effective escapes and when injured, they can also use their magic to drain nearby enemies' vitality.Assassin  Stealth abilities.Soul Magic  Drains vitality from opponents.Hades Items  Reduce cooldown and increase mobility.Hades Weapons  Can drain health from enemies and perform surprise attacks in certain special attacks.Hades Armors  Focus on increasing cooldown reduction.Powers and Abilities  As the ruler of the Underworld and everything that resides within it, Hades is both the oldest of his siblings and one of the most powerful of the Olympian Gods surpassed only by his brothers Zeus and Poseidon. Hades is naturally a force to be reckoned with by any being who is foolish enough to anger him. His will alone is the absolute authority in both the gloomy realm itself as well as all other areas that are under his control; Nothing happens in the realm without his knowledge of it.Personality  Unlike his brother Zeus and many of the other Gods of the series, Hades is mostly unconcerned with the affairs of the mortal realm, preferring to focus his energies on the Underworld. He is, however, quick to anger if someone crosses him or his family, which makes him an enemy of Kratos. As Kratos is traveling through his palace, Hades comments that there is bad blood between them, as Kratos had murdered his niece (Athena) and his brother (Poseidon). He also appeared to have deeply cared for Persephone, despite her words and treachery. Indeed, he has restored her remains and created a massive memorial to her. He doesn't comment on the loss of his nephew Ares, indicating that Hades, much like the other gods, did not care much for Ares. This means that, unlike most of the other Gods, Hades cared for his family. Hades had a sinister, sadistic, mock-playful humor, evident in the way he taunts and intimidates Kratos throughout the Underworld. This is similar to the mythological Hades, who often gave out ironic punishments to particularly unfortunate souls. He also appears to be a masochist, as even when Kratos beats him senseless and tears away chunks of flesh, he claims to enjoy the pain. Like most Olympians, he has no respect for the mortals he has shown in the wager of the gods. He sent a plague to Alrik's father to force him to compete in the wager just for his own amusement and when he lost he convinced Alrik to seek revenge on Kratos, unintentionally setting in motion the events of the series.Gifts and Objects Trivia Related Pages Titans  The Titans were the race of deities who ruled the world before the Olympian Gods came to existence. They were the ones who aided Kratos in his quest for vengeance against Zeus but they became the secondary group of antagonists upon Gaia's betrayal.Greek Mythology  In Greek mythology, the Titans (\u03a4\u03b9\u03c4\u03ac\u03bd) were a race of extremely powerful and physically huge deities that ruled the world during the legendary Golden Age of Mankind. They were the children of Gaia and Ouranos. There were 12 original Titans, the males being known as the Titans (Oceanus, Coeus, Kreios, Hyperion, Iapetus, and Cronos) and the females as the Titanides (Rhea, Theia/Thera, Phoebe, Mnemosyne, Themis and Tethys). They were ruled by the youngest Titan, Cronos, who overthrew Ouranos\u00a0with the aid of Gaia (who crafted his sickle) and his brothers (not Oceanus) and Typhon, Titan God of Wind Storm and son of Tartarus and Gaia. Later, several of the Titans also produced offspring which were also Titans. These Titans included the children of Oceanus (the Potamoi and Oceanids), the children of Coeus (the Coeides: Leto, Asteria and Lelantos), the children of Kreios (the Creionides: Astraeus, Pallas and Perses) , the children of Hyperion (the Hyperionides: Helios, Eos and Selene), the children of Iapetus (the Iapetionides:\u00a0Atlas, Menoetius, Prometheus,\u00a0and\u00a0Epimetheus). The Titans preceded the Olympian Gods\u00a0who, led by Zeus, eventually overthrew them in the Titanomachy. The Titans were then imprisoned in Tartarus, the deepest and darkest pit\u00a0of the Underworld. Only a few Titans (such as Prometheus, Oceanus) were spared that fate. Atlas, who led the Titans in the Titanomachy, was forced to hold the sky (Ouranos) upon his shoulders, fore the sky was greatly damaged in the war and couldn't support itself and also because of the death of the sky (Ouranus).In the God of War Series Birth and Fate  In the beginning, there was darkness. The Titans were born on the\u00a0Island of Creation, home to the\u00a0Sisters of Fate\u00a0and controllers of time. Themis was born of Gaia, who became the embodiment of divine order, law, and custom, giving the Titans a purpose to be a part of the world. The rest of the world was created by the Titans and Cronos was given the title as ruler. However, it was prophesized that one day Cronos would be overthrown by his very children, just as Uranus had been years before. In an attempt to sway the Sisters into his favor, Cronos gifted them with the\u00a0Steeds of Time. The Sisters refused to change his fate and the fate that would also haunt the Titans forever. Cronos began devouring his children one by one so that the prophecy may not come true. His wife,\u00a0Rhea, could not bear another such loss and hid the sixth and final child on an island far away from the watchful eyes of her husband. Cronos foolishly swallowed a rock wrapped in cloth in the baby's place. The child who escaped his siblings\u2019 fate was Zeus, who was raised by his grandmother Gaia herself to nurture his desire to free his brothers and sisters from their prison. When the day came and\u00a0Zeus\u00a0had become a young man, he freed his siblings from their cruel father and the\u00a0Great War\u00a0began.The Great War  The Titans believed that they had to win or the Gods would make the mortals suffer, caring only for control and power. The Titans Prometheus\u00a0and\u00a0Helios (In the mythology Epimetheus also joined the Olympians, which isn't the case in the game) joined the Gods in the battle against the Titans, betraying their very own. The Titans were led by the great Atlas, who saved Cronos, the latter was about to have his soul consumed by the hands of\u00a0Hades, by hurtling rocks and causing earthquakes toward the God. In Cronos' place Atlas was captured by Hades with the help of Poseidon, but the battle continued. Mountains were hurled like mere pebbles, and the ground shook from massive earthquakes. The war between the Titans and the Gods forged the landscape of the mortal world. Eventually, Zeus created the Blade of Olympus, and used its immense magical power to send the Titans to the foulest pits of the Underworld \u2013 Tartarus. This ended the Great War, and the gods established their domain upon Mount Olympus, being worshiped by the mortals who begged for their mercy and guidance. The Golden Age had indeed ended.  In Tartarus, the Titans would be tortured or trapped for all eternity (despite Cronos being\u00a0the one\u00a0who caused the\u00a0great war) with the Gauntlet of Zeus being created to chain and bind them. One of the Titans chained to the walls of Tartarus with this method that Kratos encounters was Hyperion. Cronos\u00a0suffered the fate of wandering the Desert of Lost Souls with Pandora's Temple chained to his back until the strength of the whirling winds and sands ripped his flesh from his bones. Aegaeon was transformed into a living prison for oathbreakers by the Furies for breaking his oath to Zeus to fight alongside the Gods with the other Hecatonchires. The Titan Typhon was imprisoned within an enormous mountain. On the same mountain as Prometheus, because of betraying Zeus and giving the mortals the fires of Olympus, was forced to endure the pain of having his liver eaten everyday by a large eagle only to suffer the fate again and again. The great Titan Atlas was to hold the world of the living on his shoulders, his hands chained to the earth though Kratos broke one of the chains, releasing him from some of the pain.Kratos' Encounter With Cronos  Athena instructed Kratos to journey to the Desert of Lost Souls where the Titan Cronos crawled with Pandora\u2019s Temple upon his back. The Titan showed no notice of him as Kratos climbed a mountain leading to the temple for three days, while Cronos was still crawling pitifully across the harsh desert wasteland with the wind blowing in his face. The mighty Titan walked\u00a0in the\u00a0desert for millennia until Kratos retrieved Pandora's Box. They would later meet at the Steeds of Time (A holograph of Cronos). The Titan was later sent to Tartarus with the temple chained to his back.The Prisoner of Atlantis  Within the volcanic mountain outside of Atlantis, the lava titan,\u00a0Thera, was imprisoned and she appears to be the core of the volcanic activity. There, Kratos was informed by her that his arrival was foretold by Gaia and pleaded to be released or they would both remain prisoners of their own torments. Kratos hurled his blades into Thera's chest, thus receiving the power of Thera's Bane and setting Thera free, who then started tearing down her chains as the spartan left the chamber, leaving destruction in her wake. As the volcano erupted, she was seen rising out of her captivity in the distance, though what became of Thera remains unknown. It's likely that Thera, along with the other Titans, joined Kratos in his assault against the gods and was killed during the battle.Alliance with Kratos  Kratos was saved by Gaia's guidance while he was being taken to the Underworld. She told Kratos that Zeus would have to be destroyed in order for there to be any hope for Kratos. With her voice whispering into Kratos' ear, the powerful warrior traveled to the mountain where Typhon and Prometheus rested. Typhon, bound to his mountainous prison, refused to help the former Olympian. Typhon tried blowing Kratos off of the cliffs where he walked, hoping he would fall to his death. Kratos managed to obtain Typhon's Bane by stabbing Typhon's eye, blinding him. Kratos also released Prometheus from his torment by burning him to death in a fiery pit, granting him the power of the Rage of the Titans. Cronos gifted Kratos with the last of his magic while traveling with the Steeds of Time. This magic was known as Cronos' Rage. Kratos also fell into the grasp of the mighty Titan Atlas, who gifted him with the knowledge of the Great War and the powerful Atlas Quake. With all of his powers and gifts, Kratos defeated the Sisters of Fate and traveled back in time to the final minutes of the Great War. He saved the Titans from being banished and brought them into his time. There, he and the Titans climbed Mount Olympus to finally rid the mortals of the petty gods once and for all. The mortals were terrified, but there was nowhere to run or hide from the brutal battle.Second Titanomachy  With the Second Titanomachy having begun, the Olympians immediately leapt into battle against the Titans climbing up Mount Olympus. Helios, Hermes, Hercules, and Hades engaged the Titans head on, while Poseidon waits with Zeus. Hades in his giant form would use his Claws to pull dislodge the Titan Oceanus as he was making his way up the mountain. Poseidon then entered the fray by leaping off the top of Olympus, he targeted the Titan Epimetheus and blasted through his\u00a0chest, killing him instantly and knocking him off the mountain into the waters below. With the help of his Hippocampi, which erupted from the water, Poseidon pulled at least one more Titan off Mount Olympus before reaching Kratos and Gaia, in the form of a colossal watery construct. After a long and hard struggle, Kratos and Gaia combined their efforts, managing to kill the God of the Sea, with the Spartan gouging his eyes and snapping his neck. Victorious from their battle with Poseidon, Kratos and Gaia reached Zeus, who then summoned a lightning bolt to blast them off the mountain, resulting in Kratos falling into the Underworld, though not before learning that he was just a pawn for Gaia which made the Titans his new enemies along with the Gods. After killing Hades and escaping the Underworld, Kratos happened upon a wounded Gaia who praised the Spartan for surviving his fall, stating \"The blood of Cronos serves you well\". She then pleaded with him for help but he cuts the vines of Gaia's damaged hand. When she pleads to him by asking if she meant anything to him, Kratos responded in a form of cruel irony that Gaia was his pawn as she stated she must face Zeus so the Titans may have their vengeance on the Gods. However, Kratos stated the war against the gods was his war not hers. For her earlier betrayal, he uses the Blade of Olympus and cuts the remaining vine to her hand causing her to fall off the mountain to her supposed demise. Later in the war-torn city of Olympia, Helios was still engaged in combat with the Titan Perses when Kratos reached the site of the battle. With the help of a Ballista, Kratos knocked Helios and his chariot into the grasp of Perses, who crushed and tossed the Sun God across the city. Perses then proceeded to rampage throughout the city while Kratos continued onward with his own agenda and decapitated the Sun God with his bare hands. Once he made his way through an Icarus Vent, Kratos came across Perses again, who tried to kill him, as possible retribution for what Kratos had done to Gaia. Kratos managed to shun the attack of the Titan, then pulled out the Blade of Olympus and impaled Perses' left eye before causing an explosion, blasting the Titan's face. Perses fell off the mountain once again, only this time, it seemed very unlikely he would have survived the fall as he is never seen again. When sent by Hephaestus on a suicide mission to find the Omphalos Stone in Tartarus, Kratos stumbled onto the fallen hand of Gaia before encountering his grandfather: Cronos. Enraged at his very presence and for supposedly killing Gaia, Cronos made an attempt to kill his grandson, losing a few finger nails to Kratos in the process. After battling against the massive Titan, Cronos managed to swallow Kratos, which proved to be a fatal mistake as the Spartan proceeded to cut his way out using the Blade of Olympus, spilling Cronos' intestines in the process. Kratos then proceeded to kill Cronos with the Blade of Olympus before returning to Hephaestus with the Omphalos Stone to craft the Nemesis Whip. During the final battle between him and Zeus, Kratos encountered Gaia, who managed to mostly regrow her lost hand to climb back up the mountain, one last time when she interrupted the fight between father and son. Declaring that \"the reign of Olympus ends here\" upon her return, Gaia then expresses anger towards Kratos and the Gods as her world \"bleeds\" because of them. Revealing that she never sought Kratos' death, Gaia proclaims that the Spartan has left her no other choice; Zeus took this moment to comment that Kratos has failed her and that she should have chosen the other one instead. Angered by this defiance, Gaia simply replied that \"father and son will die together\" and crushed the Shrine of Olympus in her hands. Zeus and Kratos leapt into a large gaping wound in her chest caused earlier by Poseidon's Hippocampi and found their way to her heart, where Kratos proceeded to shatter its defenses, and drew energy from the Titan, causing her immense pain. The battle resumed when Zeus made his appearance and continued until Kratos stabbed Zeus with the Blade of Olympus and ran him through Gaia's heart, killing her as her body dissolving collapsed onto Olympus, leaving only large chunks of earth, and some withered trees and branches behind. With the deaths of all the other Titans, the only remaining Titan is possibly Atlas as he is left holding the world on his shoulders at Pillar of the World,\u00a0Typhon's fate is largely unknown.Appearance Physical  The Titans are as large as mountains and appear to be mostly elemental. Though they are evidently not very physically beautiful in any way with few exceptions, they possess immense physical strength and stamina. The Olympians appear more civilized and human than the Titans, whereas the Titans appear more ancient, earthly, and elemental. However, this is not applied to all Titans, as Rhea, Prometheus, Eos and Helios look more human, and share the human's common figure and overall height and appearance (though the latter two were Titans that helped the Olympians and may have transformed to their current appearance).\u00a0In-Game  There are numerous Titans who make various appearances throughout the entire God of War series. These are a few:Powers  The main powers that all Titans possessed are superhuman strength, superhuman stamina, superhuman durability,\u00a0immortality and regenerative abilities. Some of the Titans may also possess some form of energy projection and the power to control and manipulate the elements which they embody. Oceanus and Perses seem to be covered in their respective elements, Oceanus being covered in Water and Lightning, and Perses is covered in Lava implying that they both could manipulate those elements. Gaia could also possess the power over Earth and possibly over the life on it. They seem to possess shape-shifting ability, since the Titans Rhea, Helios, Prometheus and Eos fully resemble human beings in size, height and beauty. Given that their fellow Titans didn't look appealing at all, so it can be assumed that they prefer a more attractive human form, and assume their appearance. However, it is unknown what powers Rhea, mother of the six original Olympians, possesses, as she hasn't displayed her own powers in the series, as well as her current status and location being unknown, though it is likely she is deceased or living somewhere far away. They also seem to have awareness over the events that happen in the corresponding element that they embody in the world. For example, Gaia saw all the events that happened to Kratos and was able to talk to him despite not being present at the time. The same happens with other Titans like Prometheus and Typhon, who had some knowledge about Kratos eventhough they were both isolated in a mountain.Cronos  Cronos (also spelled Cronus\u00a0or Kronos), was the leader and last of the mighty Titans who were born to Gaia and Ouranos. He fathered the first of the Olympians with his wife Rhea. He fought in the Titanomachy where he was overthrown by his son Zeus. His punishment by Zeus after the battle was to forever carry Pandora's Temple on his back in chains. He is a minor character in God of War, a minor ally in God of War II and a major antagonist in God of War III.Greek Mythology  In Greek mythology, Cronos was the last of Gaia and Ouranos' children and was the Emperor of the Titans. During the reign of Ouranos, the hundred armed Hecatonchires and one-eyed Cyclops were imprisoned within Tartarus, causing Gaia great pain.\u00a0Gaia constructed a sickle and ordered her children to use it against Ouranos, but they refused. Only Cronos was brave enough to take the weapon. When Ouranos met with Gaia, Cronos ambushed his father Ouranos and castrated him with the sickle; from the blood sprouted the Gigantes, The Furies, and Aphrodite. After defeating Ouranos, Cronos reimprisoned the Hecatonchires and the Cyclops along with the Gigantes and set the dragon Campe to guard them forever.\u00a0He and his sister-wife, Rhea, took the throne of the world as Emperor and Empress, respectively. This period of Cronos' rule was called the \"Golden Age,\" as the people of the time had no need for laws or rules; everyone did the right thing, and evil was absent. Cronos learned from the Sisters of Fate that he was destined to be overcome by his own son, just as he had overthrown his father.\u00a0As a result, although he sired the gods Demeter, Hera, Hades, Hestia, and Poseidon by Rhea, he swallowed them all as soon as they were born to prevent the prophecy from happening.\u00a0The sixth and final child, Zeus, would become the son destined to overthrow Cronos and defeat the Titans. Cronos was usually depicted with a sickle, which is used to harvest crops and also the weapon used to defeat Ouranos. Other children he is reputed to have fathered was Chiron, by Philyra. His counterpart in Roman mythology is Saturn and his Canaanite counterpart is El.In the God of War Series Birth and Early Days  In the beginning, the mighty Titans were sired by the union of Ouranos and Gaia. They were all born on the Island of Creation, home to the Sisters of Fate.\u00a0Above any other beings, including the Titans, the Sisters of Fate could see the future and predict what would happen to any living being.\u00a0The Titans feared the Sisters of Fate for this\u00a0and left the Island of Creation to rule the mortal world. This marked the beginning of the Golden Age of Mankind. Cronos, the mighty ruler of the Titans, was prophesized to be overthrown by his own children in the future. To prevent this from coming true, Cronos tried to bribe the Sisters of Fate into changing his destiny by granting them the Steeds of Time. However, this gift would not prevent the prophecy from coming true. In a second attempt to prevent this from happening, his wife, Rhea, bore his children and one by one he swallowed them whole, imprisoning them within his belly. Rhea could not bear another loss, for she already had five children taken from her. When the sixth child was born, Rhea called upon an eagle to take the baby far away from the watchful eyes of Cronos. In the baby's place, Rhea wrapped a stone in cloth and offered it to Cronos, who foolishly believed it to be the baby and swallowed it whole.Great War  The mighty Titan Atlas was the military leader of the Titans in their epic battle against the Gods. Mountains were hurled like pebbles and tremendous earthquakes shook the world. Cronos had almost been defeated by having his soul taken by his son Hades, but was saved by Atlas, who was defeated by Hades and Poseidon. After Zeus created the Blade of Olympus a powerful weapon, the Titans were banished to the darkest pits of Tartarus to endure great suffering for all time, but Cronos would be granted another great fate in time.Zeus' Punishment  Not wanting to store Pandora's Box in the Flame of Olympus, which would require the sacrifice of Pandora to retrieve anything stored within the flame, Hephaestus lied to Zeus saying storing it on Cronos' back would be a much safer place since defeating Cronos is no easy task. Believing Hephaestus, Zeus, Hades, and Poseidon ordered Pathos Verdes III to construct Pandora's Temple on top of Cronos, by chaining him down and constructing it on top of him. He was then forced to wander the Desert of Lost Souls with Pandora's Temple chained to his back forever.\u00a0As suggested by Hephaestus, it was hinted Cronos was supposed to kill anyone who tried to obtain Pandora's Box, but it is implied he defied this order and allowed anyone to attempt to use Pandora's Box to destroy Olympus. When the Titan Horn would be blown, Cronos would be called upon to allow countless warriors to endure the many dangers which lurked within the temple. Above all warriors, Kratos, the Ghost of Sparta, was responsible for completing the many feats within the temple and even retrieving Pandora's Box so he could kill Ares, the God of War, for tricking the Spartan into killing his family. Kratos was successful at retrieving Pandora's Box, but Ares sensed that Kratos had the Box and hurled a pole at the Spartan, killing him. Ares then had his Harpies take Kratos to the Underworld and bring the Box to him. After Ares was killed and Kratos became the new God of War, Zeus became consumed with fear and banished Cronos to the pits of Tartarus so that the Titan is tormented for all eternity. That happened because Zeus blamed Cronos for Kratos's success on finding Pandora's Box.Encounter with Kratos  Kratos also discovered the magic Cronos had hidden within the Steeds of Time.\u00a0This magic, called Cronos' Rage, allowed Kratos to electrify his enemies much like Poseidon's Rage. Nothing else is known about the Titan other than the fact that he was responsible for destroying his own father, starting a vicious cycle. This cycle was between fathers being destroyed by their sons, much like Kratos tried to do when he fought Zeus upon the Summit of Sacrifice.Battling Kratos  After Hephaestus, The Olympian Blacksmith God, \"allies\" himself with Kratos against Zeus he tasks the Spartan with retrieving the Omphalos Stone from Cronos' stomach, with which he can fashion a weapon for Kratos that \"will give you the retribution you so rightly deserve.\" When Kratos enters Tartarus, he comes across Gaia's fallen hand before Cronos appears holding Kratos responsible for Gaia's death. The Titan revealed that after Kratos used Pandora's Box to kill Ares, Zeus became consumed with fear and banished Cronos to the Pits of Tartarus so that the Titan would be tormented for all eternity. He blames the Spartan for his torment. Kratos defends that he was tasked by the Gods to kill Ares; Cronos retorts that he did so only because of his need for vengeance but now vengeance comes to him.\u00a0 Cronos tries to squash Kratos, despite the latter claiming that he now fights against Zeus. When the Titan attempts to crush Kratos between his massive fingers, Kratos uses Solar Flare to blind him.\u00a0Cronos still tries to squash him, but Kratos manages to maneuver his way around Cronos' body, tearing one of Cronos' fingernails off. Cronos eventually catches up with Kratos, and swallows him whole.Death  After being swallowed by Cronos, and falling down his throat to his stomach, Kratos located the Omphalos Stone, before he used the Blade of Olympus to slice his way out, causing him intense pain and spilling out his intestines. Cronos desperately tries to cover his wound while Kratos emerges from his stomach with the item.\u00a0Cronos then pleads for his life, saying that since Kratos had what he came for he should just leave Cronos be. Ignoring the Titan's pleas, Kratos climbed up Cronos' chest, and shattered a piece of Cronos' shackles, which impaled him through the jaw, causing him extreme pain. Cronos desperately attempted to remove his chains from his jaw, before being left immobile cursing his situation.\u00a0Kratos then walked over Cronos's face and prepared to stab him in the head with the Blade of Olympus. In one final act of defiance, Cronos cursed Kratos stating \"I should have expected this from a coward such as yourself! A coward who kills his own kin!\" Kratos indeed killed his grandfather, Cronos, and sought to kill his father, Zeus. However, Cronos had turned on his own offspring centuries before by imprisoning them in his stomach, making his condemnation rather hypocritical. The Spartan ignored him and stabs his forehead, lethally wounding him. Cronos then slowly collapsed and died.Personality  Cronos, much like his son Zeus, was very power hungry and paranoid, as he destroyed his father Ouranos, only so he could replace him as the new ruler of the universe, but became deeply afraid of his own children, fearing that one of them would overthrow him, swallowing any of his children moments after they were ever born. However, he seems to care for his titan brethren, unlike his son Zeus, who hardly cared for any Olympian, (though only after being infected by the evils) as he was ready to kill Kratos for supposedly killing his mother Gaia. After being defeated during the Great War, forced to carry Pandora's temple on his back and then imprisoned in Tartarus to suffer for all eternity, Cronos became extremely enraged, feeling a deep hatred for Kratos, blaming him for Zeus's wrath and Gaia's supposed death, refusing to even listen to Kratos' reasons. Unlike other foes, he doesn't underestimate Kratos since he knew the Spartan could defeat a Titan by himself. When overpowered by Kratos, he begged the latter to spare him since they were family but when that was ignored he (ironically and defiantly) called him a coward who slaughters his own.Powers and Abilities  Cronos possessed extreme strength and stamina, which can be attributed to his massive size. As King of the Titans, he is the biggest and most powerful, and his strength, durability, stamina and resilience is arguably almost as great if not completely matched with Atlas. Like Atlas, he was able to show a great deal of resilience against the Claws of Hades as he was able to hold on to his soul for a great amount of time. He was also the only Titan brave enough to stand up to his father Ouranos, dismember him, and become the new ruler of the world. Cronos gave his remaining powers to Kratos on the Steeds of Time, which aided him in his quest to seek the Sisters of Fate. Cronos' powers showed similar capabilities to that of his sons Zeus and Poseidon, being that he could control lightning and thunder.\u00a0 Cronos was strong enough to hold the entire temple of Pandora on his back for centuries without resting, and even walking on both legs with it. Proof of his enormous stamina was the fact that he endured his punishment for a long time, and he also suffered massive wounds from Kratos that would have killed any mortal, gods and even other titans, such as having his stomach sliced and his intestines spilled, as well as having his jaw impaled, and finally surviving some seconds with the Blade of Olympus on his forehead, whereas other gods were killed almost instantly by Kratos with much less effort. Standing at 1600 feet tall, Cronos is easily the largest titan in the God of War series.Trivia Poseidon  Poseidon is the ruler of the oceans and is\u00a0surpassed in eminence only by his brother\u00a0Zeus. He is the Olympian God of the seas, rivers, water, storms, tempests, winds, hurricanes, rain, floods, drought, earthquakes and horses, King of the Ocean and of Atlantis. He appears as an ally in God of War and a major antagonist in God of War III.Greek Mythology  In Roman mythology, he was known as Neptune. Linear B tablets show that Poseidon was venerated at Pylos and Thebes in pre-Olympian Greece, but he was integrated into the Olympian gods as the younger brother of Hades and Zeus and third of all of his siblings, generally considered a little less powerful than Zeus. Poseidon and Amphitrite, a nymph and ancient sea-goddess and daughter of Oceanus, had many children including Triton, the messenger of the sea and herald to Amphitrite, Theseus, the cyclops Polyphemus, and Orion the giant master hunter. Like his youngest brother Zeus, Poseidon was known for having many human lovers. In the known Greek Mythos, he raped Medusa on the floor of one of Athena's temples. Angered by the blasphemy but unable to harm Poseidon, Athena\u00a0changed Medusa into a Gorgon. When she was later beheaded by the hero Perseus, Chryasor and Pegasus emerged.In the God of War Series Great War  Like\u00a0most of his siblings, Poseidon was swallowed by the Titan King Cronos. When he was released, he fought alongside his brother, Zeus, in the Great War of the Gods and Titans. During a great battle between the Gods and the Titans, Poseidon aided his brother Hades to bring down the mighty Atlas. After Atlas saved his uncle Cronos from having his soul captured by Hades, Atlas was electrocuted by Poseidon's thunder, bringing him to his knees. Hades reacted swiftly and with his fiery chains he\u00a0grasped onto Atlas. With Poseidon further electrocuting Atlas, Hades was able to capture the Titan's soul, making him stronger. After the Blade of Olympus was created and the Titans were banished to the Tartarus; the pit of torment, Poseidon was given dominion over all seas. He took Amphitrite as his wife and watched over the waters of Greece, being worshiped by sailors to grant safe passage in his waters.Wager of the Gods  Poseidon briefly appeared as a contender in the wager of the gods, a contest in which they would each choose one mortal to represent them. The ultimate goal was to capture the healing elixir, Ambrosia. At first, Poseidon kept his champion a secret from the others until finally revealing the Theran warlord\u00a0Herodius as his champion. Herodius entered said contest to save his people from a plague secretly created by Poseidon, but never returned, as Kratos and his Spartans killed both Herodius and his army. After the Spartans took Herodius' ship, Poseidon, enraged at Kratos for costing him the wager, unleashed his Hippocampi upon the ship. Although the Spartans survived, Poseidon created a massive whirlpool which dragged the Spartans closer and closer to the bottom of the sea. He then sent the Sea Snake to kill the Spartans, but the beast was killed by Kratos. The Spartans docked safely at their destination, infuriating Poseidon even further.Aiding Kratos  For a period of time, the vicious beast known as the Hydra terrorized the Aegean Sea, until Kratos, guided by Athena, was called upon. Arriving upon a mess of shipwrecks, Kratos battled the various heads of the Hydra. During this feat, he was met by the great God Poseidon, who granted Kratos the gift of Poseidon's Rage. With this magical ability, Kratos was able to cast a stream of lightning through his body into his enemies, destroying them or weakening them enough so that he may finish them off. This ability would also be of important use while battling against the Hydra King, the strongest and largest of the Hydra's heads. After destroying the beast, the nightmare the Hydra had caused for many sailors in the Aegean Sea came to an end. Poseidon was also given a section devoted to him in Pandora's Temple. In this section, Kratos obtained Poseidon's Trident, granting him the ability to breathe underwater and dive.Atlantis' Destruction  While Poseidon does not appear physically, the Ocean God attacks Kratos with a massive whirlpool and other hazards as the Spartan tries to make his way back to the now sunken Atlantis. Later, he manifests himself through one of his statues. Infuriated with Kratos for releasing Thera, the Titaness of fire, and having her destroy Atlantis, his beloved city, he vows he will never forget Kratos' actions, promising he would one day answer for them. Also, his personal army, his \"children\", the Tritons, appear as enemies.The Second Titanomachy  Poseidon is among the Gods who are listening to Zeus, who declares that they must unite against the new threat of Kratos, formerly the God of War and now a rogue mortal. Once the walls of Olympus begin to tremble, Poseidon and the other Gods ready themselves to face the Titans who have been saved from their banishment in the Great War by Kratos using the Loom of Fate. After sharing looks with his brother Zeus, Poseidon dives off Mount Olympus, right into Epimetheus' chest, knocking him off the mountain, killing him almost instantly. Poseidon then dives into a large body of water at the base of the mountain, summoning a tendril from below that grabs Gaia's arm and begins pulling her. After Kratos defeats his minions, Poseidon then emerges within a watery construct in his image, projecting Hippocampi from his chariot. Poseidon sends his steeds to attack and restrain Gaia while he himself struggles with both Gaia and Kratos.Death  After a vicious battle, Gaia punches his chest, sending Kratos on a collision course with Poseidon's human form, which Kratos rips out of the watery construct and onto a platform. There he closes in on the weakened Poseidon, who warns Kratos that the destruction of Olympus would destroy the entire world. Kratos is unfazed by this, and proceeds to beat Poseidon uncontrollably; slamming his uncle's face repeatedly against a wall, and hitting him with his own head, before throwing him to a nearby wall. Poseidon then made a desperate attempt to escape and survive, but is unable to reach the edge and is grabbed by Kratos, who then proceeds to crush his eyes and finally\u00a0break his neck, killing the sea god once and for all. This last struggle is seen through Poseidon's own perspective. As Poseidon's lifeless body falls to the water below,\u00a0his death causes a tidal wave that floods most of Greece. This would probably explain why the Desert of Lost Souls does not exist anymore. In Poseidon's Chamber, Kratos finds a note Poseidon left where it is indicated he became interested in Pandora's power over Olympus and suspicious of Zeus' intentions, expressing fear his brother has changed for the worst. The note reads:\nA mere girl, somehow she is the key to the labyrinth. I brought this statue here, but so far have learned nothing. That mortal Daedalus, in his madness, has devised a way to shield secrets from even my far-reaching view. This does not bode well. I fear Zeus is no longer the brother I once knew- Poseidon Another note indicates Poseidon's wrath and frustration towards Zeus, citing his brother's refusal to provide Olympus safe harbor from the storms that are brewing. What Poseidon means by that last comment is not clear, but it might allude to the apocalyptic future that Poseidon may have foreseen i.e. the destruction of Olympus. Even though Poseidon fought alongside his brother, he alone still had misgivings about Zeus.Multiplayer  Poseidon is one of the four mentors of God of War: Ascension's Multiplayer. His statue is the fourth one in the Rotunda of Olympus.Overview  The God of the Seas mainly focuses on defense and teamwork rather on attack power.\u00a0 Warriors\u00a0aligned to Poseidon have the best resistance to damage in the game, however, they're also the weakest damage dealers, which makes Poseidon the polar opposite to Ares in Multiplayer. This makes the alignment mostly undesirable for many players. He also grants his servants powers over ice and\u00a0the ability to heal their injured allies. A warrior of Poseidon can resist very serious blows that most players would normally not be able to, but must learn to deal with the lack of physical power, which can make battles last much longer. Teamwork is the ultimate key to becoming a great warrior of the seas.Support  Resilient to damage.Water Magic  Decrease mobility and freeze opponents.Poseidon Items  Increase defense and increase team ability.Poseidon Weapons  Can decrease enemies mobility with ice and heal nearby allies in certain special attacks.Poseidon Armors  Focus on physical and elemental resistances rather than in damage.Personality  Prior to being infected by the evils of Pandora's Box, Poseidon was apparently a benevolent God, who cared greatly for many mortals and worshippers alike. He would often grant safe passage to many sailors and was protective of his own domain. In spite of his benevolent nature, he much like his brother cheated on Amphitrite by having many flings, Medusa and Princess being notable examples. After being infected probably with \"Anger\", he notably became much more angrier and weary as he gave multiple death threats to Kratos (who he aided in stopping the Hydra King prior to being infected) when the latter destroyed his city, warned him about challenging the Gods when confronting him and reasonably but angrily tried talking him out of destroying Olympus as it would mean the death of the entire world . Despite this, Poseidon notably showed greater resilience to the evils unlike his brethren, evidenced by his note indicating how he apologized to his Princess for making her the subject of his rage (though he did not free her) and disapproved of Zeus' cruelty towards Pandora as a result of \"Fear\" and expressed his fear that his brother changed for the worst.Powers and Abilities  Poseidon was among the most powerful of the Olympian gods, second only to his brother Zeus, and surpassing his brother, Hades. It is notable that Poseidon could have single-handedly bested the Titans in God of War III, having downed two of them and making short work of Gaia, had Kratos not intervened. It should be noted that his power seems to be in direct proportion to the amount of water nearby. During the Second Titanomachy, Poseidon was strong because he had access to the sea, but once Kratos separated him from it, he was more vulnerable. This would explain why Poseidon resorts to using lightning instead of water during the first Titanomachy.Trivia Related Pages Ares  Ares was the original Olympian God of War and the main antagonist of the\u00a0God of War\u00a0game and perpetrator behind the events of God of War: Ascension, which means that he was also responsible for setting the events of the series into motion by trapping, manipulating Kratos into slaying his family and indirectly responsible for his metamorphosis into the Ghost of Sparta and setting him on the path which would eventually lead to the destruction of Olympus at his hands. He was the son of Zeus and Hera. Ares was the oldest child of Zeus and was commonly referred as the most hated god on Mount Olympus, even before being killed by Kratos.Greek Mythology  Ares was the God of War, son of Zeus and Hera, and one of the most prominent and powerful Gods of Olympus. He was born after the Great War of the Gods and Titans and served his father faithfully for many years. He was also a rival of Athena, his younger sister, because they were both\u00a0gods, one of War, the other of Wisdom, and wished that the\u00a0other would stand\u00a0down.\u00a0His Roman counterpart was Mars.\u00a0Mars was held in much higher esteem, second only to Kronos; Ionic form of the Doric \u1f00\u03c1\u03ac (ara), \"bane, ruin\".\u00a0In God of War Series Alliance with the Furies  Ares came to covet all of Olympus, especially Zeus's throne, so he struck an alliance with The Furies, and persuaded them to take a more ruthless approach. After learning of the prophecy of the Marked Warrior, who is destined to destroy Olympus and kill Zeus, Ares conceived a child with Alecto in the hope that their child would be the marked one so that he could aid him in overthrowing Zeus and claiming his throne. Unfortunately, Orkos, Ares' child, was not up to his standards, and was disowned. The Furies, however, saw potential in Orkos and made him their oath-keeper.Encountering Kratos  Two Gods of Olympus, Ares and Athena, raided the city of Sparta in order to capture a child named Deimos, who had been suspected of being the mortal who would destroy Olympus in The Marked Warrior Prophecy. After Ares captured the boy, Deimos' brother, Kratos, charged toward Ares to save his older brother. Despite his efforts, however, Ares hit Kratos on the face, and created a bloody scar on his right eye. Ares was about to kill Kratos but Athena persuaded Ares to leave him be. Ares then left with Deimos, and Athena quickly apologized to Kratos. Ares then took Deimos to the Domain of Death, where he would be tortured for many years by Thanatos, the God of Death. Little did Ares know that the boy to whom he gave a scar would be the same boy who would Initially serve him and later leave him in adulthood after his family would be slaughtered by his own hands due to his machinations.Wager of the Gods  Years later, the Gods created a contest, and chose various mortals as their champions for the capture of the Ambrosia. In the wager of the Gods, Ares was seen in the comics choosing Kratos as his champion, and was confident that nothing would stop him in his quest for the Ambrosia. After a grueling journey, Kratos captured the Ambrosia, and thus made Ares the victor of the wager of the Gods.Kratos' Servitude  Kratos and his Spartan army were no match for the merciless barbarians tribes of the east. Being outnumbered and overpowered, Kratos' army was losing the battle. Kratos, about to be killed by Alrik, the Barbarian King, pledged himself to Ares, the God of War, in exchange for victory. After he saw Kratos as the potential warrior that he needed to overthrow Olympus, Ares accepted, violently wiped out the barbarians, and gave Kratos the Blades of Chaos as a sign of his servitude. To ensure that the Spartan became the perfect warrior and was bound to his will, Ares and the Furies devised three blood tests for Kratos. The first had already been completed: spilling the blood of enemies. The second, spilling the blood of innocents, was easy to accomplish with Kratos' rising bloodlust as he ended countless lives with his Spartan companions, and conquered most of Greece. The last rite was spilling the blood of loved ones. Ares led Kratos to attack a village built in honor and worship of Athena. The Spartan soldiers ruthlessly killed all who lived in the village, and burned their homes to the ground in the process. Upon reaching a strange temple, Kratos was warned by the Village Oracle not to venture within its walls. Ignoring the old woman, Kratos, blinded by bloodthirst, killed all who were within the walls of the temple, including his wife, Lysandra, and his daughter, Calliope. Ares appeared before the bloodstained hands of Kratos, and told him that it was necessary to have his family eliminated so that nothing stood in his way. The ashes of Kratos' loved ones were gathered by the Village Oracle who then placed them upon his skin as a permanent reminder of the monster he had become: the Ghost of Sparta. Enraged by Ares' deception, Kratos declared vengeance upon the God of War who once saved his life. After Kratos left Ares' service, the God of War's son, Orkos, learned of the injustice that his parents had inflicted on Kratos and turned against his father and his mothers. Orkos sought counsel from the Oracle, Aletheia, who revealed Ares' plot to overthrow Olympus. When Orkos and Aletheia went to warn Zeus, Ares discovered their attempt and sent the Furies after them. Orkos escaped while Aletheia had her eyes torn out and hidden in the ruined Statue of Apollo. The Furies then ruthlessly hunted Kratos to force him to return to Ares' service for their plan to reach its fruition. During Kratos' triumph over the Furies, it was revealed that Ares had wanted Kratos returned to him; the plan was ruined when Kratos killed the Furies and mercifully killed Orkos, who was remade the oath keeper to Kratos, and thereby severed his bond. Kratos managed to escape and served Olympus for 10 years, all while hoping to redeem himself as well as for his sins to be forgiven.Battle with Kratos  Jealousy came over Ares for Athena, and, as a result of that jealousy, Ares laid siege to Athens. Since Zeus had forbidden the Gods from waging war with one another, Athena could not step in to protect her city. Instead, Athena enlisted the help of Kratos, who had faithfully served the Gods for 10 years. Kratos was instructed to find Pandora's Box in order to kill Ares. While Ares relentlessly tore Athens apart, he suddenly sensed that Kratos had retrieved the Box. Although he was impressed, Ares picked up a broken pillar and hurled it into the desert, which flew into Pandora's Temple and struck Kratos in the chest, impaling him to a wall and killing him. Ares' Harpies retrieved the Box and brought it to him. However, Kratos escaped the Underworld through the help of the mysterious Grave Digger. Ares challenged Zeus, and threatened to open the Box and use it against Olympus. It seemed all was lost, until Ares looked behind him and saw a returning Kratos standing behind him. He then mocked Zeus by his saying that he sent a broken mortal to defeat the God of War. Kratos, using his power granted by Zeus, took the Box from Ares' hands and opened it. The Gods\u2019 power was unleashed, and Kratos felt its magic pour into him, which caused him to grow into a giant (though Ares was still noticeably bigger than him). Kratos' strength matched Ares, and the ultimate battle for power began. Ares claimed that Kratos was still just a mortal, and was every bit as weak as the day that he begged him to save his life. Kratos recalled that he was not the same man that Ares had found that day \u2013 the monster Ares created had returned to kill him. Ares boasted that Kratos had no idea of what a true monster really was. Ares then unleashed large spider-like spikes from his back, and was ready to finally kill Kratos for good. Kratos gained the upper hand during the fight, but Ares trapped him in an illusion\u00a0where his family was attacked by an army of clones of himself (representing his mistake of killing his wife and child), and stated that there were more effective ways of killing someone than just physical harm. Though Kratos had managed to kill all of the clones, Ares mocked him, ripped the Blades of Chaos from his arms, and killed the image of his family with them. The two of them returned to the real world, where Kratos was emotionally beaten, and Ares boasted that Kratos should have been stronger and prepared to kill him with His Sword.Death of Ares  Kratos, however spotted the Blade of the Gods (which had sent by Athena), dodged Ares' attack, took up the sword, and defeated him in battle with it. Ares pleaded for his life while reminding Kratos of the day that he had saved his life, and how he had only tried to make him a great warrior. Kratos ironically recanted that Ares had \"succeeded\" in doing that before he impaled him through the chest, and killed him. The God of War fell into the Aegean Sea, and was no more, dead at the hands of the mortal that he controlled many years ago. Before his last breath, Ares released a loud death cry, which caused blood to burst from his chest, and a powerful explosion was released. However, Kratos, having killed Ares, the one who made him kill his family, asked Athena to remove the nightmares of his past. Athena replied that even though he had been forgiven of his sins, the Gods nor any mortal could ever remove his memories of killing his family. Kratos realized that his nightmarish visions of his past sins would never leave him and thus tried to kill himself over Suicide Bluffs. Athena saved Kratos and said that the Gods could not allow him, who had done such good deeds for them, to die by his own hand. Athena then said that Ares's tactics and methods were brutal and while the Olympians mourned for their brother, Ares's path of destruction had to be stopped. However, with Ares's death,\u00a0there was an empty place on Olympus for a new God of War: Kratos. Kratos then ascended to Olympus and was given the crown, throne, and title as the new God of War, which meant that the peace of Ares' death was broken and whenever there were wars, for good or evil, they would be sought by and given permission to by Kratos, the new; all-powerful; and immortal God of War. After Kratos' success in defeating and killing Ares and becoming the new God of War, the Spartan citizens disowned Ares and hailed Kratos willingly (save for a few staunch supporters of Ares), and even removed all effigies of Ares and replaced them with those of Kratos. However, a few\u00a0faithful Disciples of Ares attempted to revive their fallen God of War with the power of the Ambrosia (a power that could resurrect even a God), but Kratos had destroyed Gyges, the island in which the Ambrosia rested on, in order to prevent the followers of Ares' plans from coming to fruition.After Ares' Death  After Kratos was betrayed by Zeus and stripped of his Godly powers, Kratos was rescued by Gaia, the Titaness of Earth, who told him that the Sisters of Fate had the power to help him go back in time, avert his betrayal and face Zeus. On the Island of Creation, Kratos came upon a room known as the Garden of the Gods, in which there was a Statue of Ares where he was referred to as \"The Fallen God of War\". Kratos, after he faced many challenges to get to the Sisters, finally arrived at the Temple of the Fates where he met one of the sisters, Lahkesis. She told Kratos that no one could change their destiny and then began to fight him. As Kratos hurt Lahkesis gravely, she summoned her sister, Atropos,\u00a0from within herself. Atropos quickly grabbed Kratos, took him inside the mirrors, and brought him back to the day where he faced and killed Ares. She threw Kratos on the Blade of the Gods that he used to kill Ares and become the new and great God of War. Then she tried to change his past by destroying the blade. With the blade gone, Ares would be victorious. In order to maintain his existence, Kratos protected the blade while he battled Atropos, eventually defeated her, secured his past, and trapped her inside the mirror.The Second Titanomachy  While he faced the Hippocampi on Gaia's hand, Kratos followed a path that lead to a chamber, the Tomb of Ares, which contained Ares' massive corpse that was concealed in ice. Kratos fought the first Centaur of the game there. Despite being dead, Ares played a small role in the third game, as he was mentioned by Athena, Hephaestus, Hera,\u00a0Cronos, Zeus, and Kratos, and was also shown in flashback scenes. There was also a large fresco of Ares in the upper part of the Chamber of the Flame, which showed him wielding his trademark sword. That fresco was located right next to a fresco of his mother, Hera. Ares' voice was heard when Kratos ended up in his psyche. With the death of Zeus and the near destruction of the world, Ares' plan for Kratos to take down the Olympian Gods and Mount Olympus came to full fruition, though not as he hoped.Multiplayer  Ares was one of the mentors of God of War: Ascension 's Multiplayer\u00a0and the only mentor who was not a son of Cronos. His statue was the first one in the Rotunda of Olympus.Overview  \"With the powers of the god of war, a warrior of Ares is what some might call a \"glass cannon\": the best physical damage dealers from the game, but also the least resistant to damage. This makes Ares the opposite to Poseidon in Multiplayer. His warriors also have a natural bond with fire and heat, which makes them even more fierce by allowing them to keep burning and harming enemies even after an attack.\" A Warrior of Ares could annihilate his enemies in a matter of seconds, but must watch out for incoming attacks. The God of War's servants could survive in hoards of enemies by themselves, which made that the best class for Trial of the Gods.Warrior  Dominant physical powers.Fire Magic  Damage over time and disable enemy defenses.Ares Items  Enhanced melee combat.Ares Weapons  Grant damage bonuses and burn enemies over time in certain special attacks.Ares Armors  Focus on enhancing physical powers.Ares Symbols  Spear, helmet, dog, vulture, and flaming torch.Powers and Abilities  As the original god of war, Ares possessed a formidable arsenal of superhuman and magical abilities - all in correlation with combat and warfare, as these were his spheres of influence. As an Olympian prince and son of Zeus, his powers were considerably stronger than lesser gods.Personality  Being the god of war, violence and bloodshed, Ares is cruel, sadistic, and violent, as seen by his caring only about spreading chaos and conflict across the world. According to Zeus, Ares only feels joy when destroying cities and nations. Ares is also extremely greedy and power hungry, as exemplified by his wishing to destroy his father, so he can replace him as the new king of gods and the ruler of Olympus. However, all his attempts to overthrow Zeus failed. He was even arrogant to the point of openly calling out Zeus and challenging his rule. Ares also considered love for one's family a weakness, which is evident by how he tricked Kratos into murdering his family as he believed they were holding back his servant from becoming a great warrior only to learn the hard way that he should have been careful when it came to what he was asking for when he was killed by his former servant. This shows that Ares never cared much for his kin, as he plotted to kill his father Zeus and disowned his son Orkos after he could not meet Ares' expectations. His relationship with his mother Hera and brother Hephaestus was unknown as he was not shown despising them. Ares envies his sister Athena, as she was favoured by Zeus and was always trying to prove himself as superior to her in every way, such as creating the perfect warrior for example. Eventually, his hatred and jealousy for his sister makes him attempt to destroy the sacred city Athens; however he was stopped and killed by Kratos, with the support of Athena herself.Appearance  Ares appears as a giant warrior god. He wears a brown sleeveless tunic, shoulder pieces with wolf faces built into them, and has bracers and boots with chains on them. His boots go up to his knees. He has long hair and a beard, which seem to be made of fire.Relationships Zeus  Unlike most of the other gods, Ares ignored Zeus's orders and had no fear of Zeus's wrath, to the point that he challenged his father several times while mocking him for sending a \"broken mortal\" to fight him, instead of facing Ares by himself.Athena  Ares has a deep hatred for his sister, as he refuses to even stay in Olympus when she is around. Ares considers Athena weak and is always trying to prove himself as superior to the goddess of war, or attacking her in every opportunity, as when he would command Kratos to attack the villages and cities that were sacred to the goddess. Ares envies the amount of respect and worship that Athena receives from other deities and mortals, while he himself is hated and despised.Kratos  Back in the days when Kratos was still his servant, Ares considered him an almost \"perfect warrior\", possibly because they both shared the same rage, hatred and love for bloodshed. However, unlike Ares, Kratos still loved and cared deeply for his family; feelings that were considered a weakness by the god of war. After Kratos abandoned Ares, the warrior god started to despise Kratos, considering him just a \"broken mortal\" with no value and saying he was every bit as weak as the day the Spartan begged Ares to save his life.Trivia God of War II  God of War II is a hack-and-slash action-adventure video game and the sequel to the God of War video game for the PlayStation 2. It was released in North America on March 13, 2007, in Europe on April 27, and on May 3, 2007 in Australia. The North American NTSC version of God of War II is packaged in a two-disc set. The first disc contains the game, and the second disc is dedicated to the game's development, including a diary of the game's production. The European/Australian PAL version comes in two different editions: a single disc standard edition and a two disc \"Special Edition\" that comes in a different case than the single disc edition. It also includes different box art, a bonus DVD, as well as the PAL version of the game. God of War II won a Golden Joystick for \"PlayStation Game of the Year 2007\" at the 2007 Golden Joystick Awards.Gameplay  The gameplay of God of War II is very similar to that of its predecessor. The player controls Kratos\u00a0through a combination of combat, platforming, and puzzle game elements. It also keeps the concept of using minigames to perform bloody kills. Another element that returns from the previous game is Kratos ability to find Red Orbs to level up his weapons and magic and Gorgon Eyes and Phoenix Feathers to increase his health and magic meters. Like the previous God of War, Kratos receives numerous weapons and magical powers all throughout his quest, given to him by certain characters, or taken from his enemies. These items offer small enhancements in terms of gameplay over God of War, such as Icarus' Wings (an item cut from the original game), which allows the player to glide short distances, the Golden Fleece, which allows players to repel projectiles, and the Blades of Athena, an item returning from the first game which now lets players swing from highlighted objects.Plot  God of War II takes place shortly after the events of God of War: Ghost of Sparta; Kratos, after defeating Ares, has become the new God of War, but unfortunately has not been accepted by the other Gods due to his ruthless treatment of the other Greek city-states. Kratos is still haunted by memories of the deeds from his past while working under Ares. He finds enjoyment the only way he can, by leading and aiding his Spartan army in conquering Greece. Athena pleads that Kratos stop, telling him that she cannot protect him much longer from the wrath of Olympus and that he should not turn his back on her because it was she who made him a god. Kratos replies that he owes nothing to her and descends to the battle of Rhodes to assist his Spartan army. Kratos joins the fight as a God and begins destroying the city of Rhodes. After a short while, Kratos notices an Eagle, who Kratos believes to be Athena in disguise. The bird robs him of his godly height, infusing them into the Colossus of Rhodes and bringing it to life to kill Kratos. After a protracted conflict with the metal giant that rages across the city, Zeus offers Kratos the Blade of Olympus, which Zeus himself used to win the Great War between the Gods and the Titans. At Zeus' behest, Kratos infuses the Blade with his godhood, rendering him mortal but enabling him to destroy the Colossus from the inside. However, Kratos soon finds himself mortally wounded after being crushed by the severed, falling hand of the statue. Kratos realizes he must retrieve the Blade of Olympus to save himself. As he slowly gets up and limps his way to the sword, Zeus reveals himself as the Eagle that stole his power, and he betrayed Kratos so that his fate will not be the same as Ares'. Zeus then stabs the Blade of Olympus into Kratos' chest, killing him after he refuses to forever serve the Gods. However, as Kratos is being dragged towards an eternity of torment in the Underworld, he is saved by Gaia, the mother of the Titans and the franchise's narrator, who offers an alliance. Gaia tells the story of Zeus and how Cronos, Zeus' father, ate all of his children to prevent the prophecy that one of his own children would rise against him and how Rhea, Zeus' mother, saved her child and sent him away to an island that was really Gaia, the Titaness Mother of Earth and Zeus' grandmother, and Gaia nurtured Zeus until he grew to be a man and sought revenge against Cronos and all the Titans. As the Great War between the Gods and the Titans emerged, Zeus soon created a powerful weapon called the Blade of Olympus to end the Great War and with the Blade he banished the Titans to the depths of Tartarus. When the Titans were defeated by the Gods, they were punished and humiliated, and they want Kratos' help to exact revenge. Kratos escapes the Underworld and is bidden by Gaia to find the Sisters of Fate in order to change his past and avert his betrayal and kill Zeus. She gives Kratos the aid of the magical horse Pegasus to traverse the distance to the Sisters. Kratos and Pegasus, after a detour to a mountain that houses the Titan Typhon and the former Titan Prometheus, start flying towards The Island of Creation, but are again attacked by Griffins and Ravens, aided by the Dark Rider. The Dark Rider succeeds in slamming into Pegasus, sending the horse plummeting to its death, but Kratos counter-attacks by jumping onto The Dark Griffin, killing the Dark Rider with the Spear of Destiny, and killing the Dark Griffin by lodging the spear in its neck, as Kratos dives to the Island of Creation below. As he explores the island, Kratos encounters the likes of Theseus, from whom he kills and gains the Horse Keeper's Key and the Steeds of Time (a gift to the Sisters of Fate from Cronos in an attempt to change his own fate), Perseus, whom he savagely kills and takes his reflective shield to progress, the captain from the ship in the beginning of the God of War, and the Barbarian King whom he decapitated in the original God of War, from whom he takes the Barbarian Hammer. Kratos also encounters a haggard and crazed Icarus, whom he takes the Icarus' Wings from, and the Gorgon queen Euryale, from whom he gained the Head of Euryale by decapitating. Kratos lands upon the Titan Atlas below the earth and tries to communicate with him. At first Atlas resents the sight of the Spartan and refuses to help Kratos, bent on crushing the human for his new imprisonment since their last meeting in God of War: Chains of Olympus. However, Kratos manages to persuade Atlas to help him so that he may change his fate and kill Zeus. With the Titan accepting the offer, he grants Kratos a new power called the Atlas Quake and helps him back to the surface so that he may continue his quest. After reaching the surface he kills the Kraken and reawakens the Phoenix to fly towards the Temple of Fates with his desire for revenge for Zeus and a knowledge of Zeus destroying Sparta acts as an anger that helps him continue his quest. Finally reaching the Throne Room, Kratos expresses his firm desire to change his own fate, and that of Zeus, the King of the Gods of Olympus, after which the Sisters deny him passage through. Kratos then confronts Lahkesis. After a gruesome battle, Kratos stands witness as the middle sister Atropos comes forth from within the defeated Lahkesis, taking Kratos back in time, to the very moment of his battle with Ares. Planning on cutting his life short by destroying the Blade of the Gods, Kratos interferes by defending the Blade of the Gods, thus keeping the way things originally were. He soon defeats Atropos before traveling back to the present time while leaving Atropos trapped in a mirror. Now fighting both Lahkesis and Atropos at the same time, Kratos manages to stab the two Sisters with his blades and destroy the mirror they are trapped in. Thus, killing them by erasing the sisters out of the timeline. With Lakhesis and Atropos dead, Kratos makes his way to the remaining sister, Clotho, who operates and defends the Loom of Fate, which rules the lives of mortals and Gods alike. Pinning Clotho's hands to the ground, Kratos kills the final sister, granting him control over the Loom and his own fate. He goes back to his death at Zeus' hands in Rhodes, saving his past self and reclaiming the Blade of Olympus from a surprised Zeus, inciting a lengthy battle with the King of the Gods. At the end of the fight, Zeus stuns Kratos with a powerful lighting storm, Kratos then announces untruthfully that he surrenders. As Zeus is about to kill Kratos, he deflects the blow using an energy blast and pins Zeus's hands to the rock with The Blades of Athena. Kratos then takes the Blade of Olympus and begins driving it into Zeus' chest. Before he could finish, Athena arrives and defends Zeus, however, Kratos is angered by her interference as Athena announces her intentions to protect Olympus. The badly wounded Zeus attempts to escape, while stating Kratos has started a war he can't possibly win. However, Kratos breaks free of the defending Athena, charging towards Zeus with the Blade of Olympus, but Athena sacrifices herself by impaling herself upon the blade, granting Zeus escape. A stunned Kratos asks her why she did this as the dying goddess reveals that Zeus' actions are meant to break the cycle of son killing father, which goes back to Cronos defeating Uranus, and Zeus defeating Cronos. By killing Kratos before he can kill him, Zeus had hoped to break the cycle - thus confirming that Kratos is, in fact, Zeus' own son, she begs him to relent in his quest for vengeance. After a moment of apparent shock and shame, Kratos darkens and snarls that he has no father. Athena dies in Kratos' arms, saying that all the Gods on Olympus will deny Kratos, defending Zeus so Olympus will prevail. She said that even though Kratos wishes to kill Zeus, Zeus is Olympus. Kratos then vows to exact retribution on Zeus and any God who will deny him his vengeance, saying that their time is at an end. The dead Athena's body soon explodes as Gaia speaks to Kratos and reminds him that he has the power to control time itself. Kratos returns to the Loom, as the room its in collapses around him and he goes back in time once more to the Great War of the Gods and Titans. He calls to Gaia and she announces that the Titans were expecting him and then Kratos explains they can win the Great War in his time. As a defeated Zeus encourages his fellow Gods to help him kill Kratos, the Titans return to Kratos' time, angry and vengeful they climb Mount Olympus to kill Zeus and the Gods. Leading them, Kratos announces to Zeus \"Zeus! Your son has returned, I bring the destruction of Olympus!!!\", thus leading directly into the events of God of War III.Characters Enemies Common Enemies Bosses Items and abilities Weapons Magics Relics Treasures  Much like the first God of War, upon beating the game, additional costumes can be unlocked, for Kratos to wear. Similar to Challenge of the Gods, God of War II offers Challenge of the Titans after beating the game once. A new addition has Kratos collecting urns that give him special powers. Another new feature called \"Bonus Play\" allows one to replay the game with all of Kratos' weapons and powers, as well as using the Urns of Power previously collected.Bonus Costumes Cast Critical Reception  Upon its release, God of War II garnered overwhelming critical and commercial acclaim. Many consider it to be one of PlayStation 2's best games, and also one of the best action games of all time. It contains four times as many boss fights and improved puzzles in comparison to the original. The game is also considered to be the swan song of the PlayStation 2 era \u2014 in other words, the last great game released exclusively for the console. In North America, the game had sold 833,209 copies by the end of March 2007, twice as many copies as the next-best selling game. In its first week of release in Europe, the game took the top spot in the UK charts as well. The game went on to sell over one million copies in its first three months. As of July 11, 2007, the game has sold two million copies. On March 13, 2008, God of War II joined Sony's renowned Greatest Hits list.Cut Content See also Trivia External links Gaia  Gaia is the Primordial entity of the Earth, mother of the Titans and the grandmother and great-grandmother of the Olympian Gods. She is the narrator of the series,\u00a0the deuteragonist\u00a0of God of War II, and the secondary antagonist of God of War III.Greek Mythology  In Greek mythology, Gaia (\u0393\u03b1\u00ee\u03b1) was the primordial goddess personifying the earth. She was an ancient chthonic deity and was considered the Mother Goddess of all life. Gaia is also known as Mother Earth. Gaia created Ouranos but later Ouranos (Roman: Caelus) and Gaia created the starry sky. Together they created the elemental Titans, amongst others the world ocean Oceanus, the pre-Olympic sun Hyperion (\"The High-One\"), Iapetus (father of Prometheus), Rhea, Mnemosyne (\"Memory\"), Phoebe (\"Light\") and Tethys (wife and sister of Oceanus, mother of the world rivers). After they were born, Cronos, the wily, youngest, and most terrible of her children, who hated his sire, was asked by Gaia to punish Ouranos for sending the Cyclops and Hecatonchires to Tartarus. Wielding a flint sickle, Cronos castrated him and threw his testicles into the sea, it's foam creating Aphrodite. After that, Cronos would rule the world until he was overthrown by Zeus and his siblings. Other Titan-born creatures came from Gaia such as the Hecatonchires and the dragon Python. Her equivalent in the Roman pantheon was Terra.In the God of War series  In the God of War series, Gaia is the narrator for all of the games but has only actually appeared in God of War II and God of War III. She is portrayed as being made of earth, covered head to toe with trees, and fuller in shape reminiscent of the Venus of Willendorf, though in Greek Mythology she was essentially the Earth itself.Birth and Early Days  Being one of the Primordial, Gaia was a descendant of Chaos. Together she and the other Primordials created the universe. Wishing to survey their work, they made the Island of Creation, where all life would begin. The first to be born was Gaia, who would become the mother of the earth. Ouranos, the Primordial god of the sky and lord of the heavens, joined with Gaia and giving birth to the Elder Cyclopes, the Hecatonchires, and the Titans.First Titanomachy  It was prophesized that one day Cronos would also be overthrown by his children, just as he overthrew his own father. In an attempt to avoid this, he swallowed them whole after they were born. However, Cronos's wife, Rhea, could not bear another loss and tricked Cronos into swallowing an Omphalos Stone wrapped in cloth. This baby was named Zeus and would be raised within Gaia's own body until he came of age and decided to take revenge upon Cronos. When Zeus became an adult, he freed his brothers and sisters from the belly of Cronos and began a revolt against the Titans, starting the Great War. During this war, Gaia aided the Titans in the battle and was eventually cast into Tartarus along with her children. Following these events, Gaia kept watch over the life of the Spartan Warrior and her great-grandson Kratos, hoping to use his talents in her desire for her future vengeance against Zeus.God of War II Alliance with Kratos  Following Zeus betraying Kratos and his subsequent fall into the Underworld, Gaia deemed the time was right to finally reveal herself to Kratos. She appeared before the Spartan who questioned her identity as she revealed her name and how she been watching him throughout all his life and has decided to help him destroy Zeus. She then heals his wounds and tells him with her help, she would guide to the Sisters of Fate to aid him in his quest. Once Kratos escaped, Gaia sent the Pegasus to help in his journey. When Kratos ordered the Pegasus to take him to Olympus, Gaia told him he was no longer a god and that he could no longer access the Mountain. She then explains for Kratos to get revenge, he would need the power of the Sisters of Fate to travel back in time to the moment Zeus betrayed him so he could reclaim Blade of Olympus as Zeus would be at his most vulnerable. She directed him to her son Typhon but the latter was not willing to aid an \"Olympian\" trapping the Pegasus as Gaia told Kratos it was needed to reach the Sisters. As a result, Kratos was forced to explore the cavern before he managed to steal Typhon's Bane and soon coming upon Prometheus and after killing him to put him out of his misery, his blood merged with the fires granting Kratos Rage of the Titans which he used to free the Pegasus and leave the cavern. Kratos soon arrived on the Island of Creation where he journeyed facing many enemies. In the middle of his quest, Kratos inquired as to why Gaia chose to aid him as she told Kratos the story of events that led to the Great War and how she was banished at the end of the but helped Kratos in his quest for revenge. When Kratos nearly fell into the Underworld after a fight with Icarus, Gaia told Kratos that he needed to return to the surface. Perhaps fortunately and unfortunately, Kratos landed on Atlas who nearly crushed him but he managed to persuade him to aid him in destroying Zeus. Atlas helped Kratos in returning to the surface and the Spartan resumed his journey. When reaching the Garden of the Gods, Athena possessed a statue and warned Kratos not to trust Gaia or the Titans stating they are using him but he disregarded her warning by destroying the statue. When Kratos fought and killed the Last Spartan and was distraught by the destruction of his home Sparta, Gaia appeared in a mental image posing as Lysandra, Kratos' wife. As the Ghost of Sparta lost hope, Gaia warned him if Zeus discovered he was still alive the latter would come after him relentlessly and that when Kratos dies Zeus' brother Hades would ensure his soul would be forever tormented. She soon gave him hope again by telling him to take in his loss of his city and people to fuel his rage and achieve victory. She told him that he was needed to lead the Titans into battle. Her words encouraged Kratos and he defeated the Kraken and soon made his way to the Sister's palace. Upon confronting Lahkesis, she stated Gaia was filling his head with lies before fighting him with her sister Atropos. This warning along with Athena's warnings foreshadowed Gaia's impending actions. When Kratos trapped them both in a mirror, he destroyed erasing them from existence before he killed the last Clotho. With the sisters gone, Kratos had access to the power of time as Gaia told him to look among Threads of Fate for his own in order to go back to the moment of Zeus' betrayal. Kratos returned to the moment Zeus tried to kill him where he reclaimed the Blade of Olympus and confronted Zeus. After a fierce battle, he nearly succeeded in killing him but Athena intervened and Kratos stabbed her instead. A dying Athena revealed that Kratos was Zeus' son which by extension made Gaia his great-grandmother. After Athena's last pleas failed to convince Kratos to abandon his revenge, Gaia reminded him that he still had the power to control time itself. With this Kratos returned to his time, he soon rewinds time to go further into the past going farther than his own birth to the final moments of the great war. Kratos called out to Gaia who had been expecting his arrival stating the gods were too much for them now. However, Kratos told her that Ares and Athena were dead while Zeus was weakened and that he now possessed the Blade of Olympus. He told her that if they work together, they could destroy the gods and see Mount Olympus crumble. Realizing that he needed them to come to his future, Kratos told Gaia to come to his time along with the other Titans from the first Great War. This act saved them from their banishment to Tartarus and allowed them to scale the mountain to exact vengeance. Gaia carried Kratos on her back as the Spartan told Zeus that his son had returned to bring forth the destruction of Olympus. This marked the beginning of the Titans' Second Great War with the gods.Second Titanomachy  Gaia and Kratos led the Titans in battle as they climbed Mount Olympus, however, the Olympian Gods were not scared and quickly engaged their former enemies again igniting the Second Titanomachy. As Titans clashed against the Gods they also encountered the minions of Gods who jumped into the fray and used their abilities to attempt to knock the behemoths off the mountain but this did not deter the Titans nor Kratos who defended them with his powers determined to make the Gods pay. Unfortunately, the Sea God Poseidon entered the battle and after killing Epimetheus summoned his Hippocampi which began to attack the Titans pulling them to their deaths. One of the monsters latched onto Gaia preventing her from climbing, the titan had told Kratos to free her from the constraints after doing so the two came face to face with the Hippocampi version of Poseidon who using his mighty trident and his minions had delivered many powerful blows to Gaia. However, after Kratos defeated the monsters and attacked Poseidon's head, the god was left immobilized. Taking advantage of this, Gaia punched at her grandson's chest which also launched Kratos in a clear path of the sea god's chest knocking him out of his monster projectile and throwing him on a platform of the mountain where he was brutally killed off personally by Kratos. After Poseidon's death, Gaia told Kratos the death of Zeus was within their reach and the two continued their travel towards Zeus. Arriving at the Dias, the two confronted Zeus who traded words with his son over his quest for vengeance as Kratos swore to destroy him but the King of the Gods prepared to fire a lightning bolt at them. Gaia attempted to halt the attack but it was futile as the blast sent Gaia and Kratos plummeting back down the Mountain.Betraying Kratos  Gripping to Mount Olympus for dear life, one of Gaia's hands partially snapped off due to Zeus' attack barely connected by enormous vines. Kratos attempted to hold onto Gaia's back with the Blade of Olympus, but after calling for aid, Gaia refuses. Stating both of them would die if she tried to help, and trivializing Kratos' revenge as being secondary to the Titans' own goal for vengeance. Gaia then told him that he was a mere pawn that had lost its usefulness, before letting him fall stating the war was for the Titans. As the Spartan fell, he swore revenge on Gaia for using him.Gaia's downfall  When Kratos escaped the Underworld after killing Hades, he managed to reach the city of Olympia, where he encountered Gaia again. The titan was astonished to find Kratos still alive remarking the \"blood of Cronos\" served him well. She was in distress, asking Kratos for his help as Kratos, still enraged about Gaia not having helped him in his hour of need, questioned why he should. Gaia soon begged her great-grandson for help but Kratos started to sever the vines connected to Gaia's snapped-off hand. Desperate and in pain, Gaia asked Kratos if she meant nothing to him to which The Ghost of Sparta retorted in a show of cruel irony it was, in fact, Gaia who was the pawn, his pawn while telling a pleading Gaia that the war against Zeus was \"his war\" not hers. Kratos then destroyed the root of Gaia's hand with the Blade of Olympus, sending a screaming Gaia plummeting to her apparent doom at the bottom of Mount Olympus. Much later, Perses attacked Kratos in shafts of the labyrinth presumably for what happened with Gaia but Kratos killed him instead. When Kratos visited Tartarus, he came across Gaia's severed hand and met with Cronos, who stated Gaia was dead and subsequently attempted to kill Kratos to avenge her only for Kratos to kill him.Gaia's Death  When finally having reached Zeus again, Kratos did battle with him before their fight was interrupted as Gaia had returned, having replaced her severed hand with one made of twisted tree roots. Declaring the reign of Olympus ended now, Kratos was shocked that she survived as states she never sought Kratos' death, but she now saw no other option due to the damage he had inflicted upon her Earth. Zeus commented she should have chosen the other one, but Gaia simply replied she would destroy them both, crushing the Shrine of Olympus in her hands. Both father and son fell into Gaia and found their way back to her heart, where Kratos shattered its defenses, and drew energy from the Titan, causing her immense pain. After Zeus made his appearance, the battle resumed, until Kratos stabbed Zeus with the Blade of Olympus and ran him through Gaia's heart, she screamed in terrible agony and pain as her heart exploded, killing her as her body collapsed onto Olympus possibly killing all of the remaining survivors while dissolving into dust. When Kratos awakened from the fall, all that remained of the mighty Titan were large chunks of earth, and some withered trees and branches.Personality  Gaia was once a caring and loving Titan, helping anyone no matter the cost. She even cared for and nurtured Zeus, when the young god was hiding from his father Cronos. However, after the Great War, when all Titans were punished for the crimes of one, Gaia's heart became filled with hatred for Zeus and the Olympians. She became so obsessed with vengeance that she started to rebel against the Sisters of Fate themselves, manipulating Kratos as a pawn and then, discarding him and anyone else who dared to cross her path, only seeking to exact her revenge against the Gods of Olympus.Powers and Abilities  As the primordial and personification of the earth, Gaia has absolute control and manipulation over rocks and plants of the world. She has superhuman strength, stamina, durability and is an Immortal. She also can be considered to have omniscience since she is narrator of the games. She also possesses considerable regenerative abilities, as she was able to grow back the hand Kratos chopped off of her. She also seems to have the power to communicate throughout time as she was expecting Kratos during the first Titanomachy even though it was centuries before Kratos' birth.Trivia Athena  Athena was the Olympian Goddess of Wisdom and War, and the Deuteragonist of the God of War Series, who mostly appeared as an ally of Kratos. She was seen as a neutral character\u00a0in God of War II, and her place as Deuteragonist was taken by Orkos in God of War: Ascension, by Gaia in God of War II, and by Atreus in God of War (2018). In the middle stages of\u00a0God of War III, after Gaia betrayed Kratos, Athena took her place back as the Deuteragonist and helped Kratos in ways that she was able to. She had a cameo appearance as an illusion in God of War (2018), where she goads Kratos about his past.Greek Mythology  Athena (also pronounced Athene), also referred to as Pallas Athena (\u03a0\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03c2 \u0391\u03b8\u03b7\u03bd\u03ac; pronounced /\u02c8p\u00e6l\u0259s/), was the Goddess of Civilization, Wisdom, War, Strategy, Craft, Justice, and Skill in Greek Mythology. Minerva, Athena's Roman incarnation, embodied similar attributes. Athena was also a shrewd companion of heroes and the Goddess of heroic endeavor. She was the virgin patron of Athens. The Athenians\u00a0built the Parthenon on the Acropolis of her namesake city, Athens, in her honor (Athena Parthenos).Biography Hunting the Marked Warrior  Zeus, driven by fear after hearing the oracle's prophecy that Olympian rule would end at the hands of a \"Marked Warrior\", sent Ares and Athena to capture the one destined to overthrow Zeus. Noticing the strange birth marks on Deimos, they invaded Sparta and captured the boy. His older brother, Kratos, tried to stop them, but was easily swatted aside by the God of War. Before Ares could kill Kratos, Athena intervened and told him they already had what they came for. Before she left, she gave one last look to the young Kratos and asked for forgiveness. That set in motion the prophecy, as they unknowingly picked the wrong Spartan youth; it was Kratos who would destroy Olympus, not Deimos.Siege of Athens  Out of utter hatred and jealousy towards Athena, Ares summoned monsters from the Underworld and used them to attack the city of Athens. Since Zeus had forbidden the Gods from battling each other directly, Ares thought that nothing could stop him. For this reason, Athena and the other Gods sought to empower Kratos to save Athens and put an end to Ares' rampage once and for all. She guided him throughout the game to Pandora's Box. After the death of Ares, she revealed that Kratos was forgiven of his sins, but the Gods never agreed to relieve him of his nightmares; no Mortal or God\u00a0could ever forget the terrible things that he had done. With all hope lost, Kratos felt abandoned and flung himself from the Suicide Bluffs that overlooked the Aegean Sea and believed that death was his only escape from his madness. However, Athena saved Kratos from falling to his death.\u00a0The Gods had not abandoned Kratos at all. Athena gave Kratos the throne of Ares and the title of God of War. She also granted him the Blades of Athena to replace the Blades of Chaos that were given to (and taken away from) him by Ares.Aiding the God of War Kratos' Hunt for the Ambrosia  As Kratos made his way to the Ambrosia once again, Athena tried to warn him about the many dangers on the path to the Ambrosia. Kratos simply shrugged off her warnings however, and moved on. Kratos later encountered her again, and was told by the Goddess that it was the dead that he must fear. Further on, Kratos found the dead Spartan\u00a0Soldiers whom he had abandoned many years ago. They returned from the dead and were ready to fight Kratos and kill him in anger and vengeance, but Kratos defeated them.Finding Deimos  After the events of God of War, Kratos set out on a journey to find his mother, Callisto, an act which Athena tried to prevent. After the two debated on whether or not Kratos should abandon this quest, soldiers of Triton attacked the ship. After Kratos (reluctantly) defeated Callisto in battle, he proclaimed to Athena that the Gods had lied to him about his brother. After gaining no response to his proclamations, Athena finally answered, tried to warn Kratos, attempted to dissuade him, and begged for forgiveness. Kratos then realized that she was there when his brother was kidnapped years ago as she stated that there were reasons for it. Enraged by that revelation, Kratos destroyed the Statue which Athena had used to communicate with him. After the death of both Deimos and Thanatos, Athena came out of a Portal, she told him that his ties to the Mortal World were severed and that he was ready to be a God. She then attempted to empower Kratos to full Godhood, but Kratos refused however, and swore that the Gods would pay for the pain that they had\u00a0caused him and his family. After Kratos had left for Olympus, Athena begged for his forgiveness and even went so far as to silently acknowledge him as her brother.Zeus' Betrayal  Unfortunately, Kratos was a far more ruthless God of War than Ares ever was. Shunned by his fellow Gods, and angry toward them for not ridding him of his nightmares (and the suffering his mother and brother went through), he turned to his Spartan Army. Together, they began to conquer all of Greece. Athena warned Kratos that if he did not stop his path of destruction, the wrath of Olympus would grow ever stronger and that she would not be able to protect him. Kratos disbelieved Athena, turned his back on her, and went to the island of Rhodes where his Spartan army had lain siege. Athena was left with no other choice but to help rid Olympus of Kratos. As a colossal God, Kratos tore apart the city of Rhodes until an eagle flew over him, drained much of his godly power, and shrunk him down to mortal size. At first, Kratos believed that it was Athena\u2019s act of defiance against him, until it was actually revealed to be the King of the Gods himself \u2013 Zeus.Speaking to Kratos  During Kratos\u2019 journey through the Island of Creation, he came upon the Garden of the Gods, where a golden statue of Athena warned him not to listen to Gaia or the Titans (this warning would later prove to be justified during the events of God of War III). She soon explained to Kratos that there were more important things besides seeking revenge and that Zeus did what he had to in order to protect Olympus: The King of the Gods did in fact fear Kratos. However, Kratos ignored the warning, destroyed the statue, continued on his quest to the Sisters of Fate, and soon defeated them.Death  The warnings of Athena did not move Kratos, and he continued his path of vengeance until he faced Zeus once again. Taking the Blade of Olympus, Kratos stabbed Zeus with it repeatedly until Athena intervened. Angered by her interference, Kratos pushed her aside and struck at the fleeing Zeus. Athena threw herself in front of Zeus before he could be stabbed, and fell by Kratos\u2019 hand. Saddened by what he had done. Kratos asked Athena why she would sacrifice herself. Athena replied that Zeus must live so that Olympus could prevail. She also revealed that Kratos was the child of Zeus, who was compelled to destroy his father just as Zeus had done to Cronos.\u00a0Athena's revelation confirmed that Kratos was her brother and he was a Demigod.\u00a0Sickened by that very fact and more vengeful than ever, Kratos claimed that he had no father and left Athena to die in a spectacular burst of green light. Kratos then\u00a0proclaimed that if all the Gods deny him his vengeance then they will all deserve death.Beyond Death  After he fell from Gaia's back during the Attack on Mount Olympus, Kratos wound up in the River Styx that led him into the Underworld. There, Athena, in a Ghost-Like State, appeared to Kratos, gave him the Blades of Exile and told him that in order for him to defeat Zeus, he had to venture back up the mountain and extinguish The Flame of Olympus, which he would find on the other side of Hera's Garden. Athena also informed Kratos about Pandora's Box, which he would find once he had reached the Flame. When a skeptical Kratos inquired as to her sudden change in heart, Athena explained that her death had brought about a change in her, an ascension to a level beyond that of the Gods, and how she understood more in that form than she did in the past. She stated that Zeus' death was necessary if humanity was ever to be freed, and would aid Kratos throughout his quest.  After Kratos succeeded in killing Zeus, Athena stated that it was time that mankind heard her message and insisted that Kratos give the powers of the Box back to her. Kratos however, sneered at her sentiments and cited the fact that Chaos was ravaging the world and the fact that Pandora's Box was empty. Confused at first, Athena then realized that when Kratos opened the box to defeat Ares, it unleashed all the evils that Zeus had captured and infected the Gods. Instead of drawing on the evil powers within the box as she had once thought, Kratos had in fact acquired the power of Hope, the power that Athena herself had sealed in the box, should it ever be opened again. During all that time, however, Kratos had that power buried underneath all his anger, sorrow, and guilt, and thus shielded it from everyone, including himself. Athena insisted again that Kratos return the power of Hope to her, in order to restore the world and rule it as the new Queen of Olympus. Kratos instead decided to impale himself with the Blade of Olympus and thereby release Hope to all of mankind. A horrified Athena exclaimed that mankind would not know what to do with such power, before she expressed her disappointment in Kratos. Then, after Athena removed the Blade of Olympus from his chest, she vanished, and left Kratos in a puddle of blood. It was widely assumed that Athena was infected with the evil of Greed, although it was not noticeable until after her death. Athena wasn't heard of in many years and her whereabouts were unknown for a long time.Beyond the Greek Realm  Athena appears silently before Kratos as he travels home to retrieve the Blades of Chaos. Kratos, still holding a grudge against her, demands that she gets out of his head, and she vanishes. Later, she reappears in the doorway of his house while he dons the Blades. She mocks Kratos for trying to change and declares that he is and will always be a monster. Kratos agrees, but counters that he is no longer her monster. He then walks through Athena's image, while she disappears.Personality  Of all the Gods on Mount Olympus in the God of War series, Athena was arguably the least selfish and was in fact, very noble, as was displayed not only by her deep love for her people and her horror of Ares' siege on Athens, but also her deep concern and love for the rest of humanity; as shown in God of War III, she stated that she intended to \"liberate\" mankind with the power of Hope. She also was seen loving her family - particularly her father, Zeus, deeply, and even sacrificed her own life to save him, although it is possible that she only did so to save the world, as the death of Zeus would have meant the death of Olympus, and thus the destruction of the entire world. Athena even cared greatly for Kratos: she elevated him as a God, shielded him from Olympus' wrath, guided him on his quest, and remained his closest ally in all of the games. That was possibly due to her knowledge that Kratos was her brother. But in God of War III, her motives somewhat changed. For some reason, she desired the death of Zeus and motivated Kratos's quest for vengeance. It was possible that she was affected by the evil, Greed, when Kratos opened Pandora's Box, which changed her motives to personal gain. However, she did not show any of that evil in God Of War II while she was alive. She also claimed to have had a message for humanity. It was unknown what she ultimately had in mind, but it seemed that she wished the destruction of the Olympians so that she could rebuild the world and rule mankind as its sole all-powerful God. Furthermore, according to Erin Torpey, Athena's voice actress for God of War III, she considered Athena as \"Trying to do some good to the world, but ultimately wants to take it over,\" which further lent to the possibility that she was not as benevolent as she presented herself to be. In God of War, Athena while appearing in front of Kratos as an illusion retained her greed and anger towards Kratos continuously goading him about his terrible past. Kratos at this point however now resented her and was unfazed at her illusion and coldly told her he may be a monster but was no longer her monster.Power and Abilities  As the Goddess of War and Wisdom, Athena was one of the most powerful gods on Olympus; with a large variety of abilities, she was just as powerful (if not more powerful) as Ares, her rival.Relationships Zeus  Athena\u00a0was very devoted to protecting Olympus and her father, Zeus. She was favored by Zeus among the rest of his children, which ignited the jealousy of her brother, Ares. Athena even went as far to protect Zeus from being killed by Kratos, though whether she did that\u00a0to protect the world or out of genuine love for her father was unknown. Athena\u00a0died by taking the strike meant\u00a0for Zeus\u00a0and the King of the\u00a0Gods took that opportunity to flee while he showed\u00a0no emotion for his beloved daughter\u00a0despite favoring her,\u00a0but it could be that he had already been corrupted by the evils of Pandora's Box by that point, and his fear of Kratos may have overshadowed any grief for his daughter, however he did show some remorse for her death later on in the series. After her death, something changed Athena. She claimed to see things where she didn't see before and believed that Mankind would suffer as long as Zeus lived. During the duration of the game, she did everything to help Kratos kill Zeus. Athena never revealed herself to her father, possibly so he would not attempt to stop her or inform Kratos of her questionable intentions.Kratos  Athena always was the most caring God to Kratos. That stemmed from their first meeting during the Raid on Sparta. As Olympian forces (Centaur Generals), cleared the way for Athena and Ares, they grabbed Deimos. Kratos tried to revolt, but was beaten down by Ares. It was Athena who stopped Ares that day from killing Kratos. She saved the life of her brother and showed regret for what she and Ares had to do. In his 10 years of servitude to the Gods, it was mostly Athena who told Kratos which task was asked of him. During Kratos' journey to the Sisters of Fate, she communicated with him and tried to stop him, but her warnings were ignored by him. It was also interesting to note that Athena knew that Kratos was still alive after Zeus' betrayal when all of the others had believed him to be dead. That showed that she was aware of his capabilities and continued to watch over him even after his dethronement as God of War. In return, Kratos was shown to care about Athena to a degree, since he was saddened by the fact that he stabbed her when he tried to kill Zeus, in direct contrast\u00a0to\u00a0Zeus who showed no emotion over her death, despite favoring Athena and fleeing afterwards. Kratos, on the other hand, was shown to be grieving over the lost of his dying ally (later\u00a0revealed to be his\u00a0sister) and asked her the reason for her sacrifice to which she revealed that it was to protect the world. She soon revealed Zeus' relation to Kratos (by extension herself as well), which shocked him as she tried to tell him to abandon his goal of vengeance. But despite Athena's pleas for Kratos to stop his ambition, he\u00a0ignored her\u00a0words and went on to state how he would destroy all\u00a0of the Gods who stood in his way and watched calmly as Athena died. Later on in\u00a0God of War III, when confronted by the Astral Form of Athena, Kratos defended his actions stating that\u00a0the Blade of Olympus was meant for Zeus. He was doubtful about her desire to help him, but later agreed to let her lead him to the flame. She tried to win back his trust and she did at a certain point. In his psyche, Kratos came face to face with his past sins, one of which was forgiving himself for killing Athena, which showed that he was deeply tormented for killing one of the few people (besides his family) who stood by his side no matter what. But, after Athena revealed her true intentions, he felt betrayed once more, which lead to an argument. He eventually repaid her by thwarting her plans by committing suicide and released the power that she craved the most: Hope. She was outraged and proclaimed to the dying Kratos: \"You disappoint me, Spartan.\" She then pulled out the Blade of Olympus, left the area despite the fact that her brother was slowly \"dying,\" and showed no concern for him as she disappeared. Kratos then grinned before he died. Years later, through her last interaction with Kratos, whom had ended up in the Norse world, it was seen they have never reconciled, with her having probably still consumed by the evil of Greed. She is still distraught by what he had done decades earlier, releasing the power of Hope, the now older Kratos still holding a grudge against her for previously meddling in his life and what he has suffered through his entire life by the Olympians. Kratos acknowledges her presence in an unsurprised manner, suggesting that her image has tormented him for many, many years since the events atop Olympus. Kratos ignores his sister's declarations by acknowledging while he may still be a monster, he is not her monster anymore and simply walks through her body, causing her to dissipate.Ares  Athena's relationship with her brother, Ares, was quite complex. For a while, they seemed to be able to work together as both of them were deployed by Zeus to retrieve Deimos. But even when on a mission for Olympus, they argued. It was Athena who stopped Ares from killing their half-brother during the raid. Zeus favored Athena, Ares felt betrayed, and, as he became estranged from Olympus, grew jealous of her. Ares started his plans to overthrow Olympus, something that he abandoned for a while after the death of The Furies. His jealousy led to him eventually to siege her city, Athens. It was noted that before his attack on her city, she had no intentions of having him killed. But afterwards, she never regretted his death as she considered him a threat to both Athens and Olympus.The Other Olympians  In the first installments, Athena was quite protective of her fellow Gods and spoke about them with great respect. She asked Kratos to stop angering them by pillaging their cities with his Spartan Army. But it was she who told Kratos, in her dying words, that every Olympian would be willing to put their life down in order to protect Zeus and if he proceeded, they would try to kill him. Due to her words, she actually signed the death warrant of her fellow Gods. In God of War III, she instead helped Kratos as he took out God after God and taught him how to use their weapons. In the end, it was implied that she had wanted them gone, so that she could become the monotheistic ruler of the Greek world.Trivia Gallery  See Athena/GalleryGod of War  God of War is a video game for the Sony PS2 console released on March 22, 2005. As an action-adventure game heavily influenced by Greek mythology, God of War was developed by Sony Computer Entertainment's Santa Monica division. It was very well received by critics and fans alike and was the recipient of many awards, including \"Game of the Year\" honors from the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences. IGN even named God of War the best PlayStation 2 game ever. The game is now available in the PlayStation 2's lineup of Greatest Hits. Thanks in part to the critical and commercial success of the original, a sequel titled God of War II\u00a0was released March 13, 2007. In 2007, IGN named God of War as the greatest PlayStation 2 game of all time, on their Top 25 PS2 Games list. God of War focuses heavily on bloody combat and puzzle-solving, much like Prince of Persia: Warrior Within. Kratos, the main character in the God of War series, uses an array of both weapons and magic powers to fight many different types of enemies, most of them based on creatures of Greek mythology. For the majority of enemies, Kratos can also initiate a minigame that involves precise button presses, analog spins, or button mashing, to finish off enemies with a bloody special kill. Spread all through the game, and obtainable in various ways, are red experience orbs, which allow him to level up his weapons and magic powers. He can find Gorgon Eyes and Phoenix Feathers as well, allowing him to increase his overall health and magic respectively. Throughout the story, Kratos obtains numerous weapons and powers from the various Gods of Olympus, many pertaining to classic Greek myths, such as spells like Medusa's Gaze, or weapons like the Blade of Artemis. God of War is notable for its movie-like presentation. While most epic games suffer from immersion-breaking loading screens, God of War's story mode switches seamlessly from the title screen to FMV sequences, to gameplay, and back, with very little load time. The load times are masked by prefetching the next area as the player traverses a long, relatively featureless area.Story  The story is told mostly in flashback, after being framed with a scene from the present wherein Kratos, standing atop the tallest cliff in Greece, laments how the gods have abandoned him and then proceeds to toss himself into the waters below. While the player starts the game three weeks prior to this event, Kratos' background is told by the Narrator during the game (revealed to be the Titan Gaia in God of War II). Kratos was a fearsome Spartan warrior and grew his fifty-man squad into an army of thousands via strategy, tactics, ferocity, and conquest. However, in a battle against a barbarian horde, his army was massacred, and, in a desperate measure, Kratos offered his life and service to Ares, the God of War, in exchange for Ares defeating the Barbarians. Ares, sensing the enormous power in Kratos, accepted his offer and destroyed the Barbarians. He also granted Kratos the Blades of Chaos, curved blades forged in the pits of Hades that were attached to long chains which were fused to Kratos' arms. Kratos then became Ares' servant, leading his Spartan army in conquering much of Greece. In one battle, they came across a village that worshiped Athena and put the residents to the sword, and their homes to the flame. There, Ares put Kratos into a rage driven by bloodlust, making him kill anyone standing in his way. Despite his own foreboding feelings and the warnings of the local oracle, Kratos entered the village's temple and slaughtered all within. Unfortunately, after his blood-lust cleared, he realized that his two last victims had been his own wife and daughter; Ares explained that this village had been a test of Kratos' power, severing the last of his humanity. The village Oracle cursed Kratos, binding the ashes of his dead family to his skin; this new pale coating gave rise to Kratos' new title, \"the Ghost of Sparta.\" and it made everyone in Greece fear him. Kratos renounced his service to Ares and began to wander the Earth, lamenting his deeds, while serving the other gods of Olympus for ten years. The player becomes involved in Kratos' story as he is approaching Athena's city, Athens, under siege by Ares' army. While in the Aegean Sea, Kratos's ship is attacked by Ares's forces. After impaling the massive heads of the fearsome Hydra, Kratos is approached by Athena, who wants him to stop Ares and save her city. Kratos agrees on one condition; that the gods relieve him of the nightmarish memories of his past crimes, as well as allowing him a chance at redemption. Kratos fights his way through the attacking forces to find the Oracle of Athens and learns from her that only Pandora's Box can give a mortal the power to kill a god. Unfortunately, due to the gods' fear of this power, the box is locked deep within Pandora's Temple, constructed on the back of the Titan Cronos, whom Zeus cursed to wander the Desert of Lost Souls until the sands rip the flesh from his bones. Kratos makes his way to the Temple, defeating many foes and evading the many traps built into the Temple by its crazed architect, Pathos Verdes III. He recovers Pandora's Box, but Ares senses his success, and throws a pillar from Athens to the Temple, impaling Kratos on a wall and killing him. As Kratos was pinned to the wall dying, Ares steals Pandora's box and Kratos is sent to the Underworld. However, Kratos is able to escape the Underworld with help from a mysterious gravedigger, who refers to Kratos as \"my child\". He returns to Athens, regains Pandora's Box, and confronts Ares. When Kratos proves that he isn't just a mortal, after all, Ares makes a desperate attempt to drive Kratos mad by making him relive the death of his family. Opening a portal, Ares traps Kratos in an illusion. Ares recreates the temple where Kratos slew his wife and child, along with images of Kratos's Family. Ares then creates copies of Kratos which attack his wife and child. After this fails, Ares strips the Blades of Chaos from Kratos' arms, taking back the weapons he had given him, and impales Kratos' family with them with Kratos watching in horror. Freed from his own mind but without weaponry, Kratos is at the mercy of Ares until he spots a very large metal sword, which was formerly used as an ornamental bridge inside Athens. With it, he engages, defeats and kills his former master, the God of War. After receiving the congratulations from the gods, Kratos asks Athena to remove the nightmares of his past. Athena explains that the gods can only forgive him for his sins; the nightmares, unfortunately, are permanent. Feeling abandoned by the gods, Kratos climbs back to the bluffs overlooking the Aegean Sea and, as the game comes full circle, tosses himself over the edge. However, as he breaks the waves below, he is pulled out by Athena. He has served the gods well, she explains, and there is a throne waiting for him that currently has no occupant: the throne of the God of War. Kratos makes his way to Olympus through a mysterious portal and claims the throne of The God of War.Characters Enemies Common Enemies Bosses Items and abilities Weapons Magic Relics Treasures  The game contains three unlockable cut scenes which are intended as potential avenues of continuing the story. These cutscenes are \"Birth of the Beast\", \"A Secret Revealed\", and \"The Fate of the Titan\". Additional costumes for Kratos are also unlocked by beating the Challenge of the Gods. Other features unlocked upon beating the game and doing certain tasks are documentaries surrounding the game's creation (like Deleted Levels) and secret messages from Kratos himself. In God of War soundtrack, \"God of War End Title\" by Ron Fish, there is a secret message around 4:29, where Kratos questions himself about his brother's return.Costumes Cast Critical Reception  God of War received strong praise from gaming critics and is widely considered one of the best PlayStation 2 games of all-time. The game was praised for its strong gameplay, graphics, and sound. A CNN review stated that God of War is the type of game that makes you remember why you play games in the first place. Reviews did find that some of the puzzle and platforming aspects, particularly while escaping Hades, were not as strong as the rest of the game.Trivia Sequel  Due to its success, a sequel was released on the PS2 (God of War II). Later, three interquels were released; two on the PSP titled God of War: Chains of Olympus, and God of War: Ghost of Sparta, as well as game for cell phones, God of War: Betrayal. The very-anticipated God of War III released on the PS3, ending the God of War trilogy. A prequel to the entire series, God of War: Ascension was released also on the PS3.Game Series Main Entries Handheld Consoles Mobile Phones Other Media Gallery:  God of War/GalleryExternal links God of War: Ghost of Sparta  God of War: Ghost of Sparta is the sixth installment of the God of War series, originally released on the PlayStation Portable and the PSP Go. It was later released along with God of War: Chains of Olympus on the PlayStation 3 as part of the God of War: Origins Collection. The story is set between God of War and God of War II and has Kratos visiting the long-lost city of Atlantis and also details more about his past, which he seeks to unravel and also learns that his long-lost mother and brother Deimos are alive.Story  The Oracle foretold that the demise of Olympus would come not from the Titans; but by a\u00a0Marked Warrior, a mortal. The Olympian Gods Zeus and Ares believed this warrior to be Deimos, brother of Kratos, due to his strange birthmarks. Ares sieges a village of Sparta and interrupts the childhood training of Kratos and Deimos, with Athena on hand to watch over him, and kidnaps Deimos. Kratos attempts to stop Ares but is swept aside and scarred across his right eye by the violent Olympian. Ares prepares to kill the young Kratos for attacking him. Athena stops Ares and tells him they only came for the Marked Warrior, not to take the boy's life. Taken to the Domain of Death, Deimos is imprisoned and tortured by the God of Death, Thanatos. Years later, Kratos, the Ghost of Sparta, has defeated and killed Ares and taken his place as the new God of War on Mount Olympus. Still haunted by visions of his mortal past, Kratos decides - against the advice of the Goddess Athena - to explore his past and travels to the Temple of Poseidon, located within the city of Atlantis. Despite Poseidon's best efforts to prevent Kratos from reaching his city, including sending the monster Scylla, Kratos reaches Atlantis. After a series of confrontations, Kratos kills Scylla. Kratos eventually locates his ailing mother, Callisto, who attempts to reveal to him the identity of his father. Kratos only hears very weak and faint noises, but she manages to tell him that his brother is alive and tormented in Death's Domain, but that he first needs to go to Ares' temple in Sparta. When Callisto is suddenly transformed into a hideous beast, Kratos is forced to battle her. Before dying, Callisto thanks Kratos and beseeches him to seek out his brother Deimos. He also encounters and frees the trapped Titan Thera, which causes a flood that destroys Atlantis. In his journey to Sparta, he also meets the Grave Digger again, who warns him not to alienate the Gods.\u00a0 While traveling through the Aronia Pass, Kratos meets Erinys, Thanatos' daughter. He fights and kills Erinys, and arrives in Sparta where he is praised by the people. While on his way to the Temple of Ares he witnesses a group of Spartans, led by the Last Spartan, tearing down a statue of Ares to replace it with one of Kratos. Kratos then goes to the Jails of Sparta where he chases a dissenter loyal to Ares who tries to kill Kratos by releasing the Piraeus Lion. However, Kratos fights and kills both foes. He returns to the Temple of Ares and after an encounter with a ghost-like form of his younger self, he learns he must return to Atlantis and find Death's Domain. Kratos then accepts his former weapons, the Arms of Sparta, as a gift from the Last Spartan, and departs. After Kratos leaves Sparta, he returns to Atlantis but when his ship draws closer to the sunken city, minions of Poseidon sink Kratos' ship and kill the crew. After nearly drowning, a statue of Poseidon possessed by the Sea God himself tells the Spartan he will pay for sinking his kingdom and he will not forget this event. Kratos then traverses through the city's ruin and eventually locates the Gateway to Death's Domain. Entering Death's Domain, Kratos eventually locates and frees his imprisoned brother Deimos. Enraged with Kratos' failure to rescue him sooner, Deimos says he will never forgive Kratos, and attacks him, only to have Thanatos intervene. Taking Deimos to the Suicide Bluffs, Deimos almost falls off the cliff. Kratos saves his brother, and the two reconcile. After giving Deimos the Arms of Sparta, Kratos and Deimos fight Thanatos together. During the fight, Thanatos transforms into a black monster and kills Deimos, but is then destroyed by an enraged Kratos. Kratos then carries the body of his fallen brother up the mountain where he the enigmatic Grave Digger (who already had a grave prepared) buries Deimos, with Kratos using the Arms of Sparta as a grave marker. The Ghost of Sparta then goes to the Suicide Bluffs where, after briefly pondering suicide, he asks himself \"By the gods, what have I become?\" The Gravedigger responds that he has become \"Death...the Destroyer of Worlds.\" Kratos turns to look at the Grave Digger who has disappeared just as Athena comes out of the portal. She tells him that his ties to the mortal world are now severed and he is ready to become a God. Athena attempts to elevate Kratos to full Godhood only to have the Spartan stop her from doing so. Kratos then returns to Olympus stating the gods will pay for what they have done. As Kratos returns, Athena quietly asks \"Forgive me...brother\", marking the first time Athena acknowledges they are siblings. In a post-credits scene, the Grave Digger is shown laying Callisto to her grave, saying \"Now, only one remains.\" A third grave is seen, implied to have been dug for Kratos. The scene shifts to Kratos on his throne, wearing his newly-forged armor, furious and determined to exact vengeance on the Gods. (It is widely assumed that this leads up to the beginning of God of War II, as Kratos, driven by the rage of the loss of his brother and mother, leads the Spartans into a vicious battle to take over the city of Rhodes. Zeus, who has been poisoned uncontrollably with Fear after witnessing Kratos murder the God of Death, later tricks Kratos and kills him, fulfilling his statement that he was going to kill the remaining person in the family he should have never made.)Characters Enemies Common Enemies Bosses Items and Abilities Weapons Magic Items Relics of the Gods  These items grant bonuses in bonus play if activated.Bonus Costumes Cut Content  Dana Jan stated that fans wanted a \"female version\" of Kratos. Dana Jan presented this idea to the team. They designed a \"Goddess of War\" costume. The costume never made it to the final publication.Cast Reception  God of War: Ghost of Sparta has received generally positive acclaim from various media outlets. IGN gave it a 9.5/10, and stated the graphics are \"better than a big chunk of PS2 games\" and that it is the \"best-looking game on the PSP thus far.\" In terms of gameplay, \"there's nothing unique here, but that's not a bad thing.\" PlayStation: The Official Magazine gave it a 10/10, saying \"Ghost of Sparta offers an immersive experience on par with many of the best PS3 games.\" 1UP gave it an A-, claiming the game is \"a more personal story than the other GOW games, but one that still features the series' signature trademarks,\" also calling the sex mini-game \"arguably the most over-the-top of the bunch.\" Eurogamer awarded the game a 7/10, saying the \"game's primary problem...is in its in-built focus. The God of War series... is principally concerned with endlessly upping the ante. The battle system is strong, but nothing without the world and set-pieces it drives. There is a sense that Ghost of Sparta is a step back for the series if you've played the PlayStation 3 game. The set-pieces, while incredible within the context of this handheld platform, seem tired when set against, for example, the opening scenes of God of War III. And when you take away the sense of wonder in a God of War game, the remaining components struggle to carry the experience.\" Eurogamer also states the game is \"best enjoyed by newcomers\" or \"those yet to play\" God of War III. Game Informer gave the game a 9.5, staying that in terms of gameplay, \"the other core fighting mechanics are familiar, but the tweaks go a long way toward improving gameplay.\" They also said that \"Ghost of Sparta doesn\u2019t have any mind-blowing moments\" but \"this isn\u2019t an optional side-story; Ghost of Sparta is a must-play for God of War fans.\"Trivia Video Trailers Cutscenes Related Pages Deimos  Deimos was the younger brother of Kratos. He was abducted by Ares during his childhood to avert a prophecy about the destruction of Mount Olympus. He was then tortured by Thanatos, God of Death for years in the Domain of Death. After he came of age in the Domain of Death, Deimos was fueled by hatred for the brother who had failed to save him from his torment. After Deimos was rescued by Kratos, and still held initial resentment toward him, he ultimately reconciled with his brother and joined forces with him to battle Thanatos only to be killed by the Death God. That was not unavenged, however, as Kratos killed Thanatos shortly after. His death was the final straw which lead to Kratos snapping at the gods and vowing to kill them.Greek Mythology  In Greek Mythology, Deimos (Ancient Greek: \u0394\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2, pronounced [d\u00ea\u02d0mos], meaning \"dread\") was the personification of terror. He was the son of Ares and Aphrodite. He was the twin brother of Phobos and the Goddess, Enyo, who accompanied Ares into battle, as well as his father's attendants: Trembling, Fear, Dread and Panic. Deimos was more of a personification and an abstraction of the sheer terror that was brought by war and he never appeared as an actual character in any story in Greek Mythology. His Roman equivalent was Formido or Metus.God of War Series Early Life  Deimos was born a few years after Kratos, and bore a remarkable birthmark across his body. The two brothers grew up together under the watchful eye of their mother, Callisto, in Sparta, with dreams of joining the Spartan Army when they were older. Kratos and Deimos trained with the traditional spear and shield throughout their childhood, with Kratos teaching the young Deimos to remember that: \"a Spartan never lets his back hit the ground.\"The Marked One Prophecy  Long ago, the\u00a0Oracle foretold the destruction of the Olympians at the hands of The Marked Warrior. Due to his unusual birthmark, the Gods feared that Deimos would be the prophesied warrior, so, they devised a plan to abduct him from his family so that the Oracle's prophecy couldn't come to pass. One fateful day, Ares and Athena descended onto Sparta to take Deimos and unleashed an army of Centaurs to decimate the populace while they searched for him. They quickly found the young Deimos amidst the chaos and took him while he trained with Kratos, though his brother attempted to stop Ares. Kratos lunged at Ares to keep him from taking his brother, but Ares struck him down, which scarred him over his right eye. Ares then attempted to kill Kratos, but Athena quickly told him not to, as they already had who they were looking for. Ares then disappeared in a cloud of fire. Athena apologized to Kratos, then disappeared in a cloud of fire as well. Ares brought Deimos to Thanatos in the Domain of Death to remain there in torment, to ensure that the prophecy of \"The Marked One\" would never occur. For several years, Deimos believed that Kratos would come to his rescue. As time passed, Deimos' hope began to fade, and was replaced with hatred for the brother who had left him to rot.God of War: Ghost of Sparta  After he met - and defeated - Callisto in Atlantis, Kratos was compelled to find his brother at any cost. After he undertook a perilous journey that took him across Greece, Kratos finally found Deimos deep in the Temple of Thanatos, suspended from a tree. Freed from his chains, save for a single massive Gauntlet that was locked around his right arm, Deimos wanted revenge against Kratos for not protecting him and quickly assaulted his brother. Deimos was instead interrupted, as Thanatos arrived grabbed Deimos and took him to Suicide Bluffs to throw him off the edge. Kratos, barely able to stand, managed to follow them to Suicide Bluffs. Locked in combat, Deimos and Thanatos never saw Kratos arrive, Thanatos managed to nearly throw Deimos off the cliff until Kratos raced to his aid. Rushing over to his brother, and barely saving him from certain death, Kratos proclaimed never to leave Deimos again, and gave Deimos the Arms of Sparta. Joining forces, side by side, as brothers, Deimos and Kratos began their attack on Thanatos. Together, the pair followed Thanatos along the cliffs and eventually caught up with him, where Thanatos stated that Ares had chosen poorly, where he should have opted for Kratos instead of Deimos, all those years ago. He then said that it didn't matter anymore, that nothing Kratos does is of his own choosing. Kratos shouted that no one, not even the gods decide his fate to which Thanatos responded that the gods decide and the Sisters of Fate make it so and that Kratos was nothing but a pawn in a game he didn't even know was being played. The Spartan Brothers charged at Thanatos, and fought the God of Death together, until Thanatos transformed into a gigantic winged monster, grabbed Deimos, and crushed him against the cliff side, which effectively killed him. Kratos, fueled by extreme rage, unleashed Thera's Bane at an unhuman level and defeated Thanatos, avenging his brother's death. Kratos carried Deimos' lifeless body to the top of Suicide Bluffs via the Path of Solitude, where the Grave Digger had prepared a grave for Deimos next to that of their mother's grave. He then lain Deimos' body into the grave and stated that Deimos was free. Kratos also made a promise to Athena that the Gods would pay for what they did to his brother and mother.God of War III  Kratos discovered several notes spread around the Underworld, with one seemingly written by his mother. The note claimed that all who got close to her son died, which included his own brother. At the end of God of War III, Gaia confronted Zeus and Kratos and admitted regret in helping him. Zeus claimed that since Kratos had failed her, she: \"should have chosen the other one\". In Ghost of Sparta, the Grave Digger (Zeus), referenced Deimos as \"the other one\", which indicated that it was Deimos that Gaia should have chosen. Kratos was then visibly\u00a0angered by Zeus' statement. Also, when in his Psyche, Kratos came across a pool of blood. After waiting a bit, a pair of interesting dialogues could be heard, when a male voice spoke out and said: Though only his voice was heard in the game, there was concept art that was made of Deimos. Deimos final Concept Art was instead used for God of War: Ghost of Sparta instead of God of War III. A Deimos Bonus Costume could be unlocked after the game was completed; however, it could only be obtained by inputting a special code that was included in a limited number of God of War: Ghost of Sparta games or by buying it online within the first week of release. It was included with God of War III: Remastered.Personality  Unlike his brother Kratos, Deimos was far more softhearted and kind. Despite that, he greatly respected and loved his sibling and would always train with him to learn how to fight. However, after being separated from his family and enduring physical and psychological torture by Thanatos; Deimos became much more aggressive and warlike, just like his brother. Nevertheless, he still held a degree of compassion and care for Kratos despite his initial resentment and what had occurred, as illustrated by their reconciliation and shared goal to stop Thanatos.Weapons and Powers  Deimos was an incredibly powerful Mortal as he was able to best Kratos, a skilled warrior and a God at the time in single combat, armed with only a gauntlet (although Kratos did not fight Deimos in full potential because he would have caused serious damage to him). For that reason, it was presumed that it was because of his Demigod attributes from his being a son of Zeus, just like his brother. Deimos was also extremely proficient with the Arms of Sparta as he wielded them to great effect in the fight against Thanatos. He had incredible strength as seen from being able to overpower Kratos. It might be possible that Deimos was able to overpower him because Kratos had let him win, as seen in the remastered PS3 version, the player got a Trophy that was called \"Let Him Win\", but it was also necessary to consider that during both fights, Deimos had endured enormous physical and psychological torture because of the years he spent in the Domain of Death and his suffering at the hands of Thanatos.Video Trivia Hercules  Hercules was the son of Zeus and half-brother to Kratos. As a mortal, he was tasked with 12 labors in order to gain redemption for the murder of his family. Being called to Olympus in order to defend it with the Gods, Hercules would consider it his 13th and final labor to rid Olympus of Kratos once and for all.Greek Mythology  In Greek mythology, Heracles/Hercules was the Demigod son of Zeus and a mortal woman named Alcmene, who is the granddaughter of Perseus. Heracles was blessed with unnatural strength from birth. He was outright hated by Zeus' wife, Hera, who drove him to madness as he grew into adulthood. This god-driven madness led him to commit the murder of his wife, Megara, and his two sons Seeking atonement for his atrocious deed, King Eurystheus assigned Heracles to perform ten labors, but cheated him into doing two more. Heracles, however, had finished all these labors (mainly using his strength) and found redemption. Heracles had many more adventures, but was ultimately killed by his own wife Deianara (albeit unintentionally), ascending to Olympus as he died. He also appears in other stories, for example, as he was one of Jason's Argonauts.In the God of War Series  Hercules is the\u00a0older half-brother of Kratos, and shares many similarities with him. Both warriors mercilessly killed their wife and children under the influence of gods (Hera for Hercules; Ares for Kratos), having been forced to serve Olympus for a number of years in order to hopefully gain redemption. Both are also demigods, being the sons of Zeus. Their rage is also uncontrollable, leading to moments where they become blinded by bloodlust. Some of Kratos' moves with the Blades of Chaos are named after Hercules (Spirit of Hercules, Valor of Hercules, and Might of Hercules). There is also a bonus costume of Hercules that can be unlocked in God of War II.In God of War III  Hercules is first seen taking orders from his father to attack the invading Titans. He then commands a large group of Olympus Sentries to jump off Olympus and attack the Titans, landing on Gaia's arm to attack Kratos. When Kratos later encounters Hera in the Arena, she has Hercules fight Kratos as her champion. There, Hercules reveals how he believes Zeus considers Kratos his favorite as Kratos was the one assigned to kill Ares while Hercules was cleaning the Augean stables. Growing even more jealous when Kratos was being crowned the God of War, while Hercules was instructed to steal the Apples of the Hesperides. Although he had taken enjoyment out of slaying the Nemean Lion, Zeus made Kratos' story more famous across the world. He then reveals how he plans to destroy Kratos as his thirteenth, unofficial and final labor, becoming the God of War himself. Kratos attempts to reason with his half-brother, saying that Zeus has no favorites and that even though Hercules wants to be an Olympian, their reign will end, but Hercules does not listen, telling Kratos, \"We'll see about that.\" After Kratos kills all of his undead soldiers, Hercules decides to fight him himself using the Nemean Cestus, throwing off the soldiers who brought and armed him with these weapons into the arena. At a point of the fight, Kratos stabs Hercules in the arm and takes the pair of Cesti one by one. Hercules then fights Kratos unarmed, which he considered a real challenge. After a long and fierce fight, Hercules lifts the floor of the arena making Kratos almost fall, but he uses the spikes on the Cestus to claw his way back up. Kratos pounds on the arena floor with the Cestus, causing it to fall on Hercules, trapping him. Taking advantage of Hercules' predicament, Kratos brutally beats Hercules to death with the Nemean Cestus, staving his head in and smashing the arena floor. Both Kratos and Hercules, the latter now dead and gruesomely disfigured, tumble into the sewers below, where Kratos leaves his brother's body to rot. Before leaving, Kratos can take Hercules' shoulder guard.Multiplayer  The Forum\u00a0where Kratos fought his half brother returns in Ascension\u00a0as one of the multiplayer maps. Hercules is featured in this level. At the beginning of each match, he is seen putting his Cestus on with the help of a pair of satyrs\u00a0and then punching them away, much like the way he did in God of War III with a pair of Olympus Sentries. Hercules watches the players fighting below him, but interferes occasionally: he jumps down to the floor sometimes, pounding the ground with the Cestus and creating a blue shockwave that pushes the players to the edge of the Arena. If not jumped properly, these shockwaves will damage players and push them away. Each wave also destroys a part of the board of the Arena, which allows players to throw each other to death in these open spaces. In the Trial of the Gods mode, Hercules role is extended: he not only creates the blue shockwaves mentioned above, but also acts as the boss of the Arena map in this mode. In the third round of the Trial, Hercules jumps down to the battlefield to fight the players with other monsters. He uses the same attacks of God of War III. After taking enough damage, he runs back to the bleachers and continues to watch over the match. In the last round of the Trial, he jumps down to fight the players once again. This time, he loses his armor after being weakened and them claps the Cesti together, destroying them and damaging near warriors as well. He continues to fight them by grabbing and punching them, exactly like he fights in the third once again. After weakening him for the last time, a red halo will appear above Hercules' head. When he is grabbed, the player(s) will push him to the ground and punch him continuously, one hitting his face and the other one, if present, his chest. The camera angles continuously changes, which also resembles much his death in the third game. After many punches, the player(s) will win the match, but won't stop hitting Hercules. Hercules is most likely left unconscious rather than being killed by the players, since his definitive death occurs in God of War III. His defeat, however, is a great act already.Personality  Hercules is an extremely prideful and fast to rage individual, despite this, he shows to greatly respect the gods, principaly his father, Zeus, who he is always trying to impress. Because of his obsession to impress Zeus, and his pride, Hercules is also extremely jealous of his younger brother, Kratos, as he believes that Kratos is Zeus's favorite son, and that Kratos had been offered greater glory than Hercules could ever achieve, while finishing his 'twelve labors', whose, according to Hercules, were just minor tasks when compared to everything Kratos have done. Hercules is determined to destroy Kratos, and claim the throne as the new 'god of war\" among the olympians.Powers and Abilities  Hercules was considered the most powerful hero and Demigod in existence. Hercules possessed a wide variety of godly powers that include:Relationships Kratos  Kratos was Hercules' half-brother and arch-enemy. When Hercules was infected with the evil of Envy released from Pandora's Box, he felt irrational jealousy towards his brother, despising how Kratos was their father's perceived favorite. He was also jealous of Kratos being crowned the God of War, being sent to kill Ares while he was stuck doing his twelve labors, such as \"cleaning\" the Augean Stables and being sent to steal the Apples of Hesperides, holding the Earth upon his shoulders as Atlas retrieved the Apples but tricked him into taking back the burden, and having his name renowned throughout the land while Hercules was not nearly as famous as his brother. During the Second Great War, Hercules fought Kratos in the Forum on Hera's orders and tried to kill him. After a long and brutal battle, Hercules was slaughtered when Kratos took the Nemean Cestus and beat him to death.Zeus  Zeus was Hercules' father. Hercules was completely loyal to Zeus, and was willing to give his life to serve him. In return, Zeus trusted Hercules very much, and gave him high authority over the armies of Olympus. Hercules was determined to stay in his father's favor, and so felt that he was looked down upon by Zeus while Kratos was crowned the God of War by the King of Olympus. Hercules led the armies of Olympus during the Second Titan-God War, but was killed by Kratos, a loss which Zeus showed little remorse for. This was his 13th and final labour to kill Kratos.Hera  The wife of Zeus always hated Hercules for being another bastard son of her husband. Because of this hate, she tried to kill Hercules in several parts of his life, which includes creating his famous Twelve Labors. Hera's anger grew stronger as the bastard son of Zeus accomplished all the suicide missions she invented to him and became even more famous for escaping death so many times. While Hercules had this same hate for Hera, the evil Envy seems to have blinded him completely: the demigod seems to have completely forgotten his rivalry with his StepMother/ Aunt and her desire to see him dead to turn his attention to Kratos. While his cooperation with Hera to do anything - even killing a common enemy - \u00a0is highly unlikely and untrustable, it is probable that Hera herself has persuaded Hercules to see Kratos as a personal rival and to fight him to death, because this new strategy would lead to the death of at least one of the two men Hera hated most in the world: Kratos and Hercules.Trivia Helios  Helios is the Titan God of The Sun and Guardian of Oaths. He is a minor and background character in God of War: Chains of Olympus and a major antagonist in God of War III. Helios is one of the strongest Gods, since he is the sun itself. He is only surpassed by Poseidon, Hades, Zeus and Ares.In Greek Mythology  In Greek mythology, the Sun was personified as Helios. Helios was the All-Seeing God of the sun and was called upon witness when needed by the Gods. He was a son of the Titan Hyperion and Theia, brother of the Goddesses Selene, the Moon, and Eos, the Dawn and the father of Circe, goddess of magic. The names of these three were also the common Greek words for Sun, Dawn and Moon. Helios was imagined as a handsome God crowned with the shining aureole of the sun, who drove the Sun Chariot across the sky each day to earth-circling Oceanus and through the world-ocean returned to the East at night. Homer described Helios's chariot as drawn by his Fire Steeds. Still later, the horses were given fiery names: Pyrois, Aeos, Aethon, and Phlegon. Although born a Titan, Helios is never depicted in the gigantic form of his parents. As time passed, Helios was increasingly identified with the God of Light, Apollo, but the two remained separate beings. Helios' mythological Roman equivalent is Sol.In the God of War Series The First Titanomachy  In Atlas' flashback of the Great War of the Gods and the Titans, Helios can be seen fighting alongside Hermes against the Titans.Wager with the Gods  Helios appeared in the gods' wager, with a champion of his own. Although endowed with powers similar to Helios' own, his champion was killed in battle by Kratos.Helios' Abduction  Helios was kidnapped by the mighty Titan by orders of the goddess Persephone, who felt betrayed by the Gods for being forced to stay with her husband Hades, God of the Underworld, six months out of every year. His disappearance allowed Morpheus, the God of Dreams, who had been alerted of Persephone's plan, to take over the mortal realm and cast the Gods into a deep slumber. Helios was taken to the Underworld, where Atlas tried to use his power to destroy the Pillar of the World-and with it, the rest of the world and Mount Olympus (the home of the Olympian Gods). Before this plan could be fully achieved, Helios was saved by Kratos, who defeated Persephone and chained Atlas to the world in the Pillar's place. During the battle with Persephone, Helios was held in Atlas' hand, forming of an orb of light. The ray of sunlight he radiated was used by Kratos to weaken Persephone. After his final battle and Kratos returning Helios to the sky but fell off Helios' Chariot and nearly hit a cliff, though he was saved by the gods. On the cliffs, an unconscious Kratos was stripped of his items by Helios and Athena. Helios, praised his actions and grateful for Kratos' rescuing him, showed pity for his sacrifices, suggesting helping him further, only for Athena to disagree, claiming that \"He'll live. They must.\"Further Appearances  While Helios does not appear in person in Ascension, God of War, Ghost of Sparta or God of War II (save the ending cutscene), technically he is always visible whenever the Sun is in the sky. Two statues of the Sun God do appear in God of War II. The first is the great Colossus of Rhodes, which, after being brought to life by Zeus, Kratos fought and destroyed. The second was found in the Garden of the Gods, as Kratos traveled through the Palace of the Fates. Helios briefly appears in person at the end, during the council of the Gods on Olympus, along with Hermes, Hades, Poseidon and Zeus. He is one of the first witnesses of the rescued Titans ascending Mount Olympus, led by Gaia and Kratos, who wanted revenge on Zeus for betraying him.The Second Titanomachy  The Gods quickly took action to defeat the Titans once again. Helios jumped onto his Sun Chariot and began attacking Gaia, throwing a fireball, combusting a fallen tree to prevent Kratos from escaping the undead soldiers that swarmed the Titaness' shoulder. Afterwards, Helios was also seen battling the Titan of Destruction, Perses, and successfully dislodged him off the mountain. Helios again confronted Perses on the slopes of Olympia, holding an advantage over the Titan because of the blinding light he emitted. He occasionally aided the minions of Olympus fighting Kratos, throwing fireballs into the area. After having fought his way through the hordes, Kratos used a ballista to damage Helios' Sun Chariot, causing him to fly straight into Perses' hand. Perses then crushed Helios with his Chariot, and threw him far into the city. After traveling through the ruined city, Kratos discovers Helios once again; severely injured from the crash and unable to lift himself off the ground. A battalion of Olympus Sentinels converged on the wounded Helios, forming a shield that Kratos could not damage due to their Onyx shields. Kratos managed to break their shields by taking control of a Cyclops which had also arrived to assist Helios, using its club to batter through their defenses before ripping the Cyclops' eye socket out and killing it.Death  Helios, pleading for his life, reminded Kratos of the debt he owed the mortal for saving him from Atlas years ago (in Chains of Olympus), and promised to repay Kratos if his life was to be spared as his life was spared from Atlas by Kratos. Kratos immediately demanded the location of The Flame of Olympus. Helios stated he would never reach it or kill Zeus and that he would forfeit his life trying; to which Kratos replied that his life is not the one Helios should worry about. Helios subsequently unleashed the power of the sun, in an attempt to blind Kratos. Kratos however, was able to block the light with his hands, slowly advancing towards the Sun God. When he got within range, Kratos began violently stomping his head, after which Helios begged him to stop. Helios told Kratos that he would have to bathe in the Flames of Olympus in order to obtain its power. Kratos immediately knew he was lying, yelling that Hephaestus told him that the Flame would kill all who touched it. Helios tried to defend himself stating that Hephaestus was lying, as the \"freak\" had fallen from the graces of Olympus; Kratos retorted that it was why he believed the Smith God. Failing to convince Kratos, and with a final gaze at the Spartan, Helios sternly told Kratos his death would not lead him to Zeus, only for Kratos to reply that is where he was wrong. Kratos then grabbed his head, and started to pull it fiercely, Kratos then, delivered a powerful hit on Helios's neck, breaking it, and then grabbed the Sun God's head again and started to pull it with all his might, Helios screamed in pain as Kratos brutally tore off his head, killing him. Helios's severed head screamed in pain and anger as Kratos observed it. With the Sun God's death, clouds blocked the sun, bringing darkness and storms permanently across the world. Kratos would then use the late god's head to discover several secrets, blind enemies, and unlocking new paths throughout Olympus, as well as the Underworld. In the final battle against Zeus, the Sun God's head, while undamaged, has its light dimmed when Zeus destroyed Kratos' equipment except for the Boots of Hermes, the Blades of Exile and the Blade of Olympus.Personality  Helios was very proud of his status as \"god of the sun\", as he was the one keeping external threats, such as Morpheus, away from Olympus. He also shows an honorable side, as he wanted to compensate Kratos for saving him from Atlas. However, after being consumed by the evils of the Pandora's box, Helios became arrogant and manipulative, as when he tried to manipulate Kratos into touching the Flames of Olympus, and called Hephaestus a \"freak\" who was cast aside.Powers and abilities  As the God of the Sun and easily one of the most important deities in the Greek Pantheon, Helios is implied to be an incredible force to be reckoned with. He may have presumably possessed all of the standard abilities of a god, including immortality, enhanced physical abilities, and great endurance, however as a natural born Titan he presumably possess greater abilities. Although while this may indeed be the case, Helios himself does not receive an opportunity to display many of these traits, as his appearances in God of War III were rather brief and did not involve any scuffles with Kratos. However, out of all the abilities he apparently possessed, quite possibly the most prominent attribute displayed by Helios is immense physical durability, as he was shown to have been able to survive being both crushed in Perses' fist and even thrown at presumably high speeds into a mountainside (although he did suffer from some injuries as a result of this). This proves that Helios, at full strength, was a truly powerful opponent to face and would have most likely put up a rather impressive fight should he have had the opportunity to face the Ghost of Sparta in a more proper setting where the odds would have been more evenly matched. In addition to his physical attributes, Helios, being the sun god, naturally has control over different aspects of the sun, such as fire or more specifically sunlight; He was shown to be able to hurl massive blasts of light at his foes that would explode in fiery glory that proved to be very effective when he is seen battling Perses at different points in the game. He also displays the ability to unleash an incredibly bright light from his body which he could use to utterly blind his enemies and even illumine even the most darkest of places (as demonstrated by Kratos using his decapitated head as a makeshift lantern). His solar powers are so strong that they can even forcefully banish Nyx, a Primordial Goddess. In addition to all of his primary powers and abilities, Helios also possessed an immense flying chariot with flaming horses that he would ride with very masterful skill into battle at great speeds. He was also in possession of his trademark Sun Shield\u00a0(worn on his left forearm), which he could use to deflect any oncoming attacks. Since he is the literal aspect of the sun, should Helios be destroyed or abducted, this would cause the sun to be blocked out by heavy rainclouds and violent storms and even disappear entirely (as shown by his death at the hands of Kratos and his abduction in Chains Of Olympus).Trivia Related Pages Blade of Olympus  The Blade of Olympus was a powerful weapon that was seen in God of War: Ghost of Sparta, God of War II and God of War III. It was created by Zeus (who forged it from the Heavens and the Earth) during the end of the\u00a0Great War in order to banish the Titans to Tartarus, which ended the brutal war once and for all.History  The weapon was created in the First Titanomachy by Zeus as means to end the war. After the defeat of Atlas, Zeus returned to the battlefield and wielded his new weapon. He pushed the Blade into the Earth and chanted that he banished the Titans to the depths of Tartarus. That created a huge vortex that engulfed the battlefield, but sent only the Titans to Tartarus where they remained chained until Kratos freed them. That weapon was first used in Rhodes, when Zeus sent it down for Kratos to help him destroy the Colossus of Rhodes. Unknown to Kratos, Zeus had tricked him into draining all of his Godly Powers into it, which supposedly gave Kratos the \"strength to destroy all who oppose the Gods.\" But, as the collapsing Colossus of Rhodes' Hand crashed down on Kratos, it appeared that he was severely weakened by giving his power to the Blade. Bloodied and beaten, Kratos tried to regain the Blade, only Zeus arrived and retrieved it, and thus prevented Kratos from regaining his powers. Zeus then shoved the blade into Kratos's abdomen, which brought him to the verge of death, and sent him to the Underworld. Later, Kratos regained the Blade of Olympus after he went back through time and with it, he fought and nearly killed Zeus on the Summit of Sacrifice. Kratos, who intended to thrust the Blade through Zeus' chest, invoked Athena's interference, and killed her instead of Zeus. When starting another game on Bonus Play, the Blade could then be used for the entire game. From there, you could level it up to increase its power and gain new abilities for it. The Blade of Olympus also appeared in God of War III, as part of the magic ability of the Blades of Athena (Divine Reckoning). Kratos planted the Blade on top of Gaia's back during the Titans' siege of Mount Olympus. When both he and Gaia were thrown off of Olympus, Kratos wedged it into Gaia in an attempt to hold on, but both he and the Blade fell into the Underworld. Later, when Kratos retrieved the Blade from a Statue of Pandora in the depths of Hades, he was able to use it as a part of the Rage of Sparta. The Rage of Sparta was the only means by which he used the Blade of Olympus. Nonetheless, the Blade proved quite useful and strong in defeating some of the major opponents that were encountered over the course of the game. It was used to slay Cronos and Perses as Kratos journeyed through the Underworld and Olympus, and in the final battle, it was used to kill both Zeus and Gaia. In the very end, Kratos ultimately used the Blade to stab himself, and thus, released the power of Hope that dwelt within him, as well as the power within the Blade itself, which was rendered useless. The blade was apparently abandoned following Kratos' disappearance from Olympus.God of War: Ascension  See The Blade of Olympus (Multiplayer)Appearance  The Blade of Olympus was a large golden and white metal sword with bluish hues of energy that brimmed through and around it.Powers & Abilities  The very powerful weapon (magically forged from both the heavens, the seas, the afterlife & the earth) that ended the Great War and banished the Titans to Tartarus, it was likely the most powerful weapon in the Series, unlike any other weapon. It possessed incredible Godly Powers, which allowed those who wielded it to kill Deities or those who were infused with Godly Might, as Kratos used it to slay the Colossus of Rhodes, Athena,\u00a0Perses,\u00a0Cronos, Zeus, and Gaia. The Blade could also release blasts of energy that were powerful enough to destroy armies in one swing. However, it appeared that the Blade required an infusion of Godly Power in order for its potential to be truly unleashed, though it's not entirely clear if it really needed that energy or if Zeus simply claimed so in order to weaken Kratos as much as possible.\u00a0In addition, it appeared that the Blade of Olympus was akin to Zeus' Thunderbolt, as it was the most powerful weapon in the world, and it, rather than the iconic Lightning Bolt, was seen with Zeus in most Statues.Combos (God of War II) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Combos (God of War III) Combos (God of War: Ghost of Sparta) Trivia God of War III  Pages related to God of War III.God of War: Chains of Olympus  God of War: Chains of Olympus for PSP is a video game developed by Ready at Dawn Studios in 2008. It was the first game in the series to be released for the PSP, the second being Ghost of Sparta. It is a prequel to the video game God of War and takes place after God of War: Ascension. The game takes place in the period in which Kratos served the Gods of Olympus for ten years. Over the years, Kratos had to complete several goals in order to achieve redemption for the nightmares that haunt him.Gameplay  Kratos, the main character in the God of War series, uses an array of both weapons and magic powers to fight a variety of enemies, with most of them based on monsters of Greek myth. All throughout the game, Kratos can find red experience orbs which allow him to level up his weapons and magic powers, as well as Gorgon Eyes and Phoenix Feathers that allow him to increase his health and magic meters. Throughout the story of the game, Kratos obtains numerous weapons and powers from the various Gods of Olympus, with many of them pertaining to\u00a0classic Greek myth.Story  Set halfway through Kratos' ten years servitude to the Gods, Chains of Olympus begins with Kratos being dispatched to the city of Attica to help defend it from the invading Persian army. Soon after his arrival, the Spartan spots a basilisk climbing over the city walls and gives chase. During his chase, Kratos confronts the Persian King inside the city and kills him. Taking the King's power to summon the Efreet, he then encounters the basilisk and kills it. After defeating the basilisk, he witnesses the sun fall from the sky, plunging the world in darkness. Following the dim remaining light on the horizon, Kratos fights his way through the city of Marathon, along the way encountering the black fog of Morpheus, which now covers the land in darkness. Eventually, Kratos makes his way to the Temple of Helios, the source of the remaining light, and the Sun Chariot. He encounters a statue of Athena, who tells him that Helios has disappeared and Morpheus has used this to his advantage to cause the gods to fall into a deep slumber. Athena wants Kratos to retrieve Helios so he can release Morpheus' grasp on the other gods and his power over the Earth. Along the way, Kratos is haunted by a strange melody, which he later recognizes as a song played by his daughter, Calliope. Making his way through the Temple of Helios, Kratos encounters Helios' sister, Eos, who promptly sends him to the caves within the Temple of Olympus. She guarantees Kratos the gods will relieve him of his nightmares if he agrees to save Helios from the Titan Atlas, who abducted him. Casting her promise aside, as the gods betrayed him before, Kratos nevertheless agrees, albeit reluctantly, to save Helios. Kratos then retrieves the Primordial Fire needed to awaken the Fire Steeds from the cave and returns to the temple. After restoring the fire steeds back to life, the horses lead Kratos into the Underworld before retreating. There, he meets Charon, on his ferry, upon the River Styx. The ferryman soon lists the similarities between himself and Kratos, saying they are both slaves to the Olympians. Charon then tells Kratos to go, saying it is not yet his time. Having denied Kratos passage, and Kratos refusing to leave, they engage in a fight, before Charon knocks Kratos unconscious and drops him into Tartarus. There, Kratos witnesses the breaking of the chains binding Atlas to the pits of Tartarus. After some time, the Spartan fights and climbs his way out of Tartarus, returning to defeat Charon. Seizing control of the ferry, he follows the light of Helios, currently illuminating the underworld, down the river Styx, coming upon the Temple of Persephone. To his own surprise, he sees his daughter Calliope on the shorelines of the temple and follows her inside. Unable to locate her, instead he meets Persephone, Queen of the Underworld. Persephone tells Kratos that Calliope is in the Elysium Fields and that the only way to see her again is for Kratos to \"release\" all of his past evils and become worthy of Elysium, giving up his powers given to him by the gods; however, Persephone warns him that the world will suffer for his choice. After transferring his power into the Forsaken Tree, which included all of his weapons, his magic, and relics, Kratos regains his humanity, becoming a normal man and being reunited with his daughter. However, Persephone appears: she taunts and mocks Kratos' choice and reveals to him her true plans. Bitter at being betrayed by Zeus, tricked by Hades and abandoned by the gods, Persephone was the one who had freed Atlas. While Kratos was disarming himself, Atlas was slowly carrying out Persephone's plan to destroy the pillar that holds the world, and with it, Olympus. Persephone plans to kill everyone, including herself, to free her from her situation. Kratos realizes now that if he stays with his daughter, it would mean the end of the world for everyone, including Calliope and himself. Though it tears him apart, he sacrifices seeing his daughter again in order to regain his power by killing all the souls in Elysium. From some of the souls, he gets back his weapons, relics, and magic. Because of this, he once more becomes the Ghost of Sparta, regaining his characteristic appearance. After which, Calliope breaks down crying at the sight of a reborn Kratos, who presses on. With his skills restored, Kratos pursues Persephone, catching her at the base of the pillar. She tells him it is the end, then reveals her other form - a winged woman wearing black armor - before carrying Kratos to the top of the pillar. Once they reach the summit, Kratos and Persephone engage in a bloody final battle; during the battle, Persephone tries to subdue and confuse Kratos, urging him to go back to Elysium and be with Calliope, and when he resists, she orders Atlas to destroy him. Kratos chains Atlas to the roof of the underworld before returning to battle Persephone and eventually killing her with the Gauntlet of Zeus. Dying, but uncaring of her fate, the goddess taunts Kratos, snarling that now his suffering shall never end as her body then explodes, severing the pillar in the shockwave with Atlas now the only thing holding the world together. Though the Titan to gloats to him about the gods' true plans for him, Kratos believes his path is clear, serving them regardless so they will keep their promises to free him from his nightmares as it is all he has left. Atlas ends by foretelling that they will meet again. Keeping his own promise to the gods, Kratos returns Helios to the sky. But he is left with the knowledge that his sins have consumed him, and he will never be pure enough to see his daughter again. Weak from battle, Kratos falls unconscious from the sun chariot but is suddenly stopped before striking the ground, being placed on the cliffs that he would later jump from in the original God of War. Two gods, Athena and Helios approach him and, as they praise him for his work, remove the Sun Shield and the Gauntlet of Zeus. As they depart through the gate to Olympus, Helios suggests on helping the warrior further, only for Athena to refuse by saying \"He'll live. They must.\" The pair then retreats through the gateway to Olympus, leaving an unconscious Kratos at the cliffs overlooking the Aegean Sea.Characters Enemies Bosses Items and abilities Weapons Magic Relics Bonus Costumes Cut Content April Fool '09 Gag Cast Trivia Videos Trailers  God of War Origins Collection for PS3Hermes  Hermes is the Olympian God of Travelers, Messengers, Thieves, Commerce, Sports, Athletics, and Speed. He is the son of the King of Olympus Zeus and the Pleiades Maia. He is also the father of Ceryx, the messenger of Mt. Olympus.Greek Mythology  In Greek mythology, Hermes is the messenger of the gods and additionally, a guide to the Underworld. As an Olympian god, his sphere of influence was vast; he was the patron of boundaries (and the travelers who cross them), shepherds and cowherds, thieves and liars (and their cunning), orators and wit, literature and poets, athletics and sports, weights and measures, invention, general commerce, profit and good luck. He also acted as the messenger of Hades, guiding departed souls to their final resting place and carrying messages between the Underworld and Olympus. Another of his duties was to take Dreams from the God Morpheus and deliver them to the mortals. His symbols include the tortoise, the rooster, the winged hat, the caduceus and his winged sandals. He was the son of Zeus and the Pleiades Maia, a daughter of the mighty Titan Atlas. His Roman counterpart was Mercury. Hermes was born sometime after the first Titan War to Zeus and a goddess named Maia. He matured rapidly and within a few minutes of his birth stole the cattle of Apollo and invented the lyre. He even thought of a clever way to cover up his crime: tying bundles of grass to the cows' feet and leading them backward out of the pasture to make it look like something had been led into the pasture, but not away from it. Despite this, Apollo found out and went to Zeus for justice. When brought before his father, Hermes attempted to charm Zeus into letting him go by telling him he was just an innocent new born baby. Undeceived, but amused by the child's boldness, Zeus instead forced him to compensate Apollo, which Hermes did by presenting him with the lyreIn the God of War Series First Titanomachy  During the Great War, Hermes is one of the gods who fought the Titans and is seen dodging a boulder thrown at him by one of them. He bore witness to his father Zeus using Blade of Olympus to banish the Titans to Tartarus for all eternity.Wager of the Gods  Hermes, much like his brethren, was briefly seen competing in the wager of the gods, a contest in which each god chose one mortal to represent themselves in a search for Ambrosia. He was later seen with Poseidon, watching as Kratos, Ares' champion, slaughtered many enemies in his path. His confidence in his own champion, Danaus, proved infallible, as he continually taunted his fellow gods about his champion being the one to steal the Ambrosia. Unfortunately for Hermes, Danaus later met his end at the hands of Hades' champion, Alrik.Ceryx' Death  Hermes' son Ceryx faced Kratos in battle, and was killed. Hermes himself seemingly did not appear, although one theory about the identity of assassin who killed Argos, claims that he was Hermes himself in disguise, since the Greek myths detailed it was he who slew Argos in the name of Zeus. If this theory is correct, it means nearly all the gods of Olympus plotted against Kratos.Second Titanomachy  Hermes was one of the Gods who battled Kratos and the Titans when they were ascending Mount Olympus. Hermes had leapt down from the balcony and ran straight down the mountain itself. He was not seen since. During his first encounter with the Labyrinth, Kratos eventually ran into Hermes directly (who just happened to be standing on a part of the Labyrinth at the time; possibly waiting for Kratos), who taunted him about his quest for vengeance and boasted his own speed. After briefly trading insults with Kratos, Hermes ran up the Chain of Balance linking the Underworld and Olympus, with Kratos in pursuit.Death  Reappearing in the Chamber of the Flame, Hermes again taunted Kratos about his lack of speed. He then led Kratos around the outside of the Olympian Citadel on a perilous chase, with Kratos dodging incoming projectiles. Eventually, Kratos managed to finally corner Hermes by launching a boulder from a catapult; chaining himself to the boulder with his blades. The boulder smashed into an Athena statue, which Hermes had previously perched himself on, and caused the statue to come crumbling down on a nearby building with the two clinging to it. Unfortunately for Hermes though, the wounds that he had suffered from the crash had left him critically injured and exhausted. Now unable to escape his enemy, Hermes ultimately decided and attempted to defeat Kratos in combat, using his formidable speed and agility to his advantage however, he would be forced to continually stop fighting to catch his breath. Upon his defeat, Hermes mocked Kratos one final time, stating in the end he would betray only himself. Kratos then overpowered him and severed his half-brother's legs in order to claim his winged boots. With his ultimate death, Hermes' corpse dissolved into a swarm of disease-carrying flies that flew across Olympus; covering the land with pestilence and causing the deaths of several of Olympus' servants in the process.Personality  Hermes is shown as being playful and childish. He is greatly arrogant and boastful of his own speed, thinking that Kratos has no chance of defeating him. He acts quite laid-back most of the time, frequently flipping his coin when idle. He is also fairly talkative, taunting Kratos about his tendency to kill family members, his quest for vengeance, and his inability to match Hermes' speed. However, it appears that this light-hearted demeanor masks an intense hatred, which occasionally becomes evident in his dialogue with the Spartan and especially manifests itself when he is forced to confront Kratos in battle. It is possible this is due to the fact that Kratos has killed his son Ceryx. Like most of the gods defeated in the game, he remains defiant to the end, laughing at Kratos' \"own sense of honor\" and insisting that the Ghost of Sparta will only betray himself in the end.Powers & Abilities  As one of the Olympians and the messenger of the Gods, Hermes was both immortal and highly resistant to most forms of physical damage. Although he himself was not nearly as powerful as many of the other gods, Hermes was still very powerful in his own right. He possessed most of the standard abilities of a god, such as enhanced physical abilities as well as increased endurance; allowing him to remain physically active for incredible periods of time. However, his most famous attribute was his immense physical agility and speed. By wearing his winged boots, Hermes' already impressive agility and speed are magnified to beyond superhuman levels and allow him to become virtually untouchable in combat. While wearing the boots, Hermes displayed his enhanced agility by performing amazing feats such as: Hermes may also have had the power of conjuring the elements, as seen at the end of God of War II, Hermes had fire protruding from his hair and winged sandals. However, in God of War III, Hermes has bright light for hair that is sometimes seen with flames emanating from it. But for all of his unique powers and abilities, Hermes was not truly invincible. In fact, for all of his boasting, he is actually one of the few gods that Kratos defeats rather easily and without much effort. Hermes mainly relied on his speed and agility in combat, knowing full well that he could never hope to win against Kratos in a straight fight. Likewise, Kratos appears to view Hermes as more of a pest than a serious threat, only engaging in battle with him after incessant taunting and provocation. Overall, Hermes, despite his limitations, still proved to be an impressive and skillful individual. Combining his agility with his physical abilities, he was able to utilize the environment around him as a means to gain the upperhand over his opponents; making him show signs of an impressive intelligence; showing that he is one of the more clever and creative of the gods (while most of the gods, despite being very creative in their own ways, were mostly blinded by the evils that were infecting them as well as their arrogance).Trivia Related Pages ", "God Of War Wiki": "God Of War Wiki Kratos  Kratos is the main protagonist of the God of War series. Born in Sparta, Kratos was a respected soldier and General, up until he lost his wife and daughter when he killed them, albeit by accident, under Ares' command, earning him his nickname The Ghost of Sparta, after which he renounced his service to the war god, eventually killing him and later on ascending to Godhood before exacting revenge against his father, the Olympians and the Titans who betrayed him. After successfully exacting his vengeance, Kratos escaped into the world of Norse Gods by settling down in Midgard in Ancient Norway where he married another woman named Faye and bore a son named Atreus who together, after the boy's mother\u2019s death, would embark on a journey to spread her ashes at the highest peak of all the nine realms.Biography Early life  Born in the Greek city-state of Sparta, Kratos is the demigod son of Zeus and a mortal woman named Callisto, although he would remain unaware of who his father was for most of his life. Outraged at Zeus for fathering yet another bastard child, Hera ordered Kratos' execution on the day he was born, but the King of the Gods took pity on the child and refused, leaving him in Sparta to be raised by Callisto. Like all Spartan youth, Kratos was monitored and trained for combat by the Spartan authorities; those who were deemed fit were to stay and be trained as Spartan warriors, while those who were deemed unfit would be sent to the mountains (probably Mount Taygetos) to fend for themselves. Already feisty and aggressive at a young age, Kratos trained together with his younger brother, Deimos, as they dreamed of joining the Spartan army when they grew up. Around this time, Zeus began to hear prophecies foretelling his demise at the hands of one of his sons, a \"marked warrior\". Hoping to circumvent the cycle of patricide before it was too late, Zeus sent Ares and Athena to hunt down and dispose of the boy who would one day rise up against him. Ares, noticing Deimos' strange birthmarks, decided to invade Sparta with an army of centaurs and take him to Thanatos, the God of Death. Kratos tried to save his brother, but Ares punched him into a pile of wood, leaving him with a permanent scar over his right eye. Insulted by the mortal's defiance, Ares prepared to kill the young Spartan\u00a0but was stopped by Athena. The Goddess reminded Ares that they had what they were looking for, and apologized to Kratos before disappearing into the flames. The loss of his brother left an indelible mark on Kratos, as he vowed to never falter again. In honor of his brother, Kratos had himself tattooed in the exact image of Deimos' birthmark. Kratos would later forget that it was Ares and Athena who took his brother from him\u00a0and wouldn't realize it until after Ares' death. As Kratos came of age, he became a respected member of the Spartan army, eventually marrying Lysandra and siring a daughter, Calliope.Quest for the Ambrosia and Rising through the Ranks of The Spartan Army  Shortly after her birth, Calliope contracted a plague, causing the Spartan authorities to deem her weak. Spartan law required that she be thrown into a chasm and left to die. Determined to save his daughter, Kratos set out on a journey for the Ambrosia after hearing from an elder of its exceptional healing capabilities. But unbeknownst to Kratos, Ares had chosen him to be his champion in the wager of the Gods, a contest with the ultimate goal being the capture of the Ambrosia; the victor would have statues erected in their honor all throughout Greece. A battalion of Spartans accompanied Kratos on his quest, including Captain Nikos. Along the way, he encountered a healer who gave him the Flames of Apollo. Kratos eventually encountered Poseidon's champion, Herodius, and killed him as the Spartans conquered his army and stole their ship. Enraged at Kratos for costing him the wager, Poseidon unleashed a handful of hazards at sea in the hopes of killing him\u00a0but failed. Later on, Kratos encountered Artemis' champion, Pothia, and killed her as well, with her army also falling victim to the Spartans, although Artemis did not retaliate. In fear that Kratos would defeat his champion, Alrik, the Barbarian King, Hades sent a torrent of fire through the sky. Although he failed to kill Kratos, he succeeded in killing many of Kratos' men, including Captain Nikos. As he found the Ambrosia, Kratos encountered Cereyon, the Helios' champion, and killed him as well. Alrik and his Barbarian army battled the Spartans for the Ambrosia, as Alrik's Father was very ill and in need of the elixir. After a grueling battle between the two leaders, Kratos successfully captured the Ambrosia at the cost of his own men and summoned an army of Rocs to continuously torture Alrik. Kratos then returned to Sparta and healed Calliope, obtaining the rank of 'Captain' from the King of Sparta. At some point after becoming captain, Kratos would command a young soldier named Atreus who remained hopeful even in the darkest times. When the day came for Atreus to lay down his life, he did it without hesitation earning Kratos' respect and was buried by the captain himself who acknowledged him as the only Spartan who ever had a smile on his face even in battle.Birth of the Ghost  As a general, Kratos won battles through brutal, but effective tactics. However, his pride and hunger for power grew greater with every victory. Despite Lysandra's pleas, Kratos vowed to continue his bloody conquests \"until the glory of Sparta is known throughout the world\", spending time with his family only when he was able to return to Sparta.  Kratos and his army finally met their match when they encountered the merciless Barbarian tribes from the East, led by Kratos' old enemy, Alrik. Outnumbered and overpowered, the Spartans quickly found themselves on the losing end of the battle, with Kratos himself left at the mercy of Alrik the Barbarian King, who sought revenge against Kratos for inadvertently causing the death of his father. In desperation, Kratos\u00a0called out to Ares, the God of War, pledging his allegiance in exchange for victory. Ares accepted the offer, proceeding to kill all of the Barbarians, including Alrik, and giving Kratos the Blades of Chaos as a sign of his servitude. For a time, Kratos served Ares loyally, raiding villages, slaughtering innocents, and spreading chaos in his name. Under the God of War's influence, Kratos became utterly ruthless and gradually lost any semblance of the humanity he once had. One day, during a raid on a village of Athena's followers, Ares secretly transported Lysandra and Calliope to a nearby temple. Ignoring the village oracle's warnings, Kratos entered the temple and slaughtered everybody inside in a fit of blind rage, including his wife and child (whom he believed were still in Sparta). Ares justified this as a means of severing Kratos' remaining attachments to the world of mortals, thereby molding him into the perfect warrior. Stricken with horror and grief at what he had done, Kratos left the bodies of his family to be burned within the temple, ultimately renouncing his allegiance to the God of War. The oracle cursed Kratos, forcing him to forever wear the ashes of his dead family on his skin. From that day forward, Kratos became known as The Ghost of Sparta; his skin now 'pale as the moon' from the ashes that coated him. To other mortals, he was now marked by his ghostly white skin - the knowledge of his past actions often repulsed them to the point where they would rather die than allow him to save their lives. He became known as the personification of cruelty and selfishness. Word of this metamorphosis would spread even outside of Greece as Norse god and advisor to Odin, Mimir who would become a future ally to Kratos himself would later on instantly recognize who Kratos was.Redemption and Vengeance  For breaking his oath, Ares ordered The Furies to hunt down the Ghost of Sparta and force him to once again serve the God of War. Meanwhile, Kratos finds himself in the abandoned village of Kirra, where he is trapped in an illusion of his home in Sparta, with his blood oath inhibiting memories of him killing his wife and daughter. The Furies' oath-keeper,\u00a0Orkos, appeared before him and encouraged him to see past the illusion, using Lysandra's necklace and ring to break it. Although Kratos distrusted him, he followed Orkos' instruction to seek out Aletheia, the Oracle at Delphi. She had earlier been captured by Pollux and Castor,\u00a0but\u00a0Kratos killed them both and took the Amulet of Uroborus. He spoke with the dying oracle, who revealed Ares' plan to mold Kratos into a warrior capable of overthrowing Zeus, thereby allowing Ares to become the new King of Olympus. Kratos then traveled back to Kirra, where he encountered Orkos once again. The oath keeper revealed that he is the son of Ares and Alecto, one of the three Furies. Orkos explained Ares' intentions to Kratos. As Zeus had forbidden the Gods from waging war on one another, Ares sought to breed a warrior capable of destroying Zeus in his stead, so that Ares may usurp him and rule Olympus for himself. Disappointed in Orkos' complete lack of fighting skills, Ares disowned his son. Instead, Orkos became oath keeper of the Furies in an attempt to please his mother, Alecto. Ares saw in Kratos the makings of the warrior he needed to overthrow Zeus, and for that reason, he helped him against the Barbarians that day. The murder of his family was meant to be one of three \"tests\" that would bind Kratos to Ares' will: the slaughter of one's enemies, the slaughter of innocents, and the slaughter of one's own family. Orkos did his mother's bidding as oath keeper and did not question her until Ares tricked Kratos into killing his family. Armed with this knowledge, Kratos took a ship to Delos. Once there, Kratos traversed a giant, ruined statue of Apollo, where he was attacked by all three Furies. In the ensuing confrontation, Kratos managed to cut off Megaera's arm, but Alecto used her power to capture him. Orkos appeared and freed Kratos, escorting him to another location, with Alecto vowing that he would never succeed. After a perilous journey, Kratos used the Amulet of Uroborus to fully restore the statue and retrieve the Eyes from the Lantern. But after completing the Trials of Archimedes, he was once again ambushed by the Furies, who take him prisoner and steal both the Eyes and the Amulet. For two weeks, the Furies tortured Kratos in the Prison of the Damned. The Spartan eventually managed to free himself and pursued Megaera through the prison. She and Tisiphone attempted to misdirect him with an illusion of a brothel. When he went to sleep with a woman inside, he spotted a ring on her finger and realized that it was a trick. He responded by tackling Tisiphone, but Megaera intervened and insisted that Kratos belongs to her. Megaera released insects into Aegaeon's hands and mouth, mutating them into insect-titan hybrids. Kratos retrieved the Amulet of Uroboros by killing Megaera and the Hecatonchires, only for Tisiphone to create an illusion of him being honored by the King of Sparta. Kratos saw through it and, progressing further into the prison, found the Scribe of Hecatonchires, the first mortal to ever be imprisoned by the Furies. The Scribe revealed that the Furies were originally fair in their punishment, and became ruthless only under Ares' influence. Making his way to Alecto's chamber, Kratos retrieved the Oath Stone from Tisiphone's pet bird, Daimon. Upon entering the chamber, the Furies project another illusion, this time of Kratos' home in Sparta. He is nearly taken in by this, for he saw his wife and daughter again. He came close to sleeping with the image of Lysandra, but soon notices the ring on her finger, revealing her to be Alecto. She then tries to convince Kratos that he could live in this illusion forever if he rejoined Ares; however, noticing the Eyes of Truth hanging on her hip, he refused, preferring the truth to living a lie. Enraged, Alecto drops the illusion and threatens to execute him if he would not serve Ares. Kratos breaks free of her sludge trap and snatches the Eyes from Alecto, who retreated back into her sanctum before she realized they were gone. Tisiphone joined Alecto as Kratos advanced on the remaining Furies. They created an illusion of a massive whirlpool, with Alecto transforming into a horrific sea monster.  Using the Eyes, Kratos broke through the Furies' illusions and forced Alecto back into her human form. As he advanced on the Fury Queen, Tisiphone dispatched Daimon once more, but Kratos simply used the Eyes to destroy the bird. He proceeded to strike Tisiphone, shapeshifting between the forms of the King and Kratos himself, as she belittled him. As he wrapped his hands around her throat, Tisiphone transformed into the form of Lysandra, causing Kratos to briefly hesitate. Tisiphone then changed into the Village Oracle, telling Kratos that his family was not there by mere chance the night he killed them before Kratos snaps her neck. With only Alecto left, Kratos drew his blades. The Fury Queen coldly tells him that the truth would only bring him pain before he plunges his blades into her chest. With her last breath, Alecto spitefully promises that her death would change nothing. With all three of the Furies dead, Kratos returned to his home in Sparta, where Orkos congratulated him on his victory. At the same time, he also revealed that he was made the new oath keeper, thereby maintaining Kratos' bond with Ares. He begged Kratos to give him an honorable death, as it would free them both from the God, to which Kratos initially refused, proclaiming that no more innocent blood should be spilled. Orkos' continuing pleas ultimately forced Kratos' hand. With this act, Kratos experienced the first of many nightmares, previously masked by his bond to Ares: this was the price he had to pay for breaking his oath. He\u00a0also discovered his path to redemption through continual service to Olympus. Kratos proceeded to burn down his house, with the corpse of Orkos inside it.Service to the Gods  For the next decade, Kratos faithfully served the Gods of Olympus in whatever tasks they required of him. During the fifth year of his atonement, he joined the army of Attica in their struggle against the invading Persian Army and the great beast they brought forth. After a lengthy battle, Kratos killed both the Persian King and the Basilisk, before asking the gods if they wished him to do more in his servitude. At that moment, the Ghost of Sparta saw the Sun fall from the sky and vanish, leaving the world in darkness. Sensing a plot at work, Kratos followed the last remnants of light on the horizon, eventually reaching the Temple of Helios and the city of Marathon. Upon consulting with Athena, Kratos realized that Helios, the God of the Sun, had been kidnapped by an unknown force, allowing Morpheus, the God of Dreams, to put the other Olympians in a deep slumber. With the Gods of Olympus incapacitated, Kratos was tasked with finding and rescuing Helios before Morpheus could seize control of the land by covering Greece under his Black Fog. Fighting through Morpheus' minions, Kratos entered the temple of the Sun God and, after learning of the events that transpired, was tasked by Eos, the sister of Helios, to awaken her brother's Fire Steeds, which would take Kratos to where Helios was being held prisoner. Having awakened Helios' Steeds, Kratos was taken to the Underworld where he saw Helios' glowing light in the distance, right before the Pillar of the World. Kratos fought his way through Hades' domain, acquired the mighty Gauntlet of Zeus, entered Tartarus and killed Charon, the ferryman of the dead. Kratos then discovered that the Titan Atlas had somehow escaped Tartarus and captured Helios. Throughout his journey, Kratos was plagued by illusions of his daughter, Calliope, and the song she played on the flute that he once gave to her. When Kratos reached the Pillar of the World and the Temple of Persephone that lay nearby, he had already forgotten his task, thinking only of reuniting with his daughter. He encountered Persephone, the Queen of the Underworld who had been kidnapped by Hades and forced to wed him. She revealed that Kratos could be with his daughter again if he relinquished all of his powers to the Forsaken Tree. Desperate to see his daughter again, Kratos did as she asked, and she allowed him to enter the Elysium fields where he met with his daughter and was seen happy for the first time since he became the Ghost of Sparta. Persephone appeared before him, revealing that it was she who freed Atlas and asked him to capture Helios. With his help, she devised a scheme to destroy the Pillar of the World, thus killing the Gods of Olympus and all of mankind as well. She taunted Kratos with the knowledge that he may live with his daughter for a short period, but would ultimately see her die again upon the completion of her plan. Kratos then forced himself to become the Ghost of Sparta again by killing the innocent souls of Elysium and regaining his powers. Whilst giving pursuit to Persephone, he realized that he would never have the chance to be with his daughter again. As he heard her crying behind him, his hatred for the Gods of Olympus deepened. An enraged Kratos succeeded in killing Persephone and chaining Atlas to the ground above the Pillar of the World, thus completing his task. Before he left the Underworld, Atlas asked Kratos if he truly believed that the Gods would keep their promise. Kratos replied that it was the only thing he could hope for now since he could not go back to Elysium. With the use of the Fire Steeds, Kratos then escaped the Underworld, but found himself too exhausted from the journey and fell from the Chariot to the ground below. He was saved by Athena and Helios, who stripped him of his powers and equipment, leaving him unconscious upon the cliffs overlooking the Aegean Sea.The Final Task  Ten years after beginning his service to the Olympian gods, Kratos was commissioned with killing the Hydra\u00a0and bringing peace to the Aegean Sea. Along the way, Poseidon granted him the power of lightning and implored him to use it against the Hydra. After a long and vicious battle, Kratos emerged victorious by impaling the Hydra's front head on the ship's mast. Entering the decaying Hydra's throat, Kratos retrieved a boat key from the ship's Captain. For unexplained reasons, he refused to save his life and instead allowed him to plummet to his death. The Ghost of Sparta celebrated his victory that night with wine and women\u00a0but continued to suffer from nightmares of his past deeds. Distraught, he approached one of Athena's statues and asked her when he would be free from his past. She told Kratos that his final task would be to find Pandora's Box and use the power inside it to destroy Ares. Kratos, having finally been granted an opportunity for revenge against the God of War, asked Athena if the gods would take his nightmares away upon completing this task. The goddess, however, refused to provide a clear answer, and instead offered him an intentionally vague promise of forgiving his past sins. Nonetheless, Kratos interpreted this answer as a 'yes'\u00a0and set sail for Athens anyway. Arriving at the docks of Athens, Kratos made his way through the besieged city, killing countless minions of Ares in the process. Encountering Aphrodite in a nearby temple, Kratos decapitated the infamous Medusa, Queen of the Gorgons, at her behest. In return, Kratos was granted the power to freeze his enemies where they stand. He later acquired lightning bolts from Zeus as well, using them to strike down a terrified Athenian guard after he refused to lower the bridge, thereby allowing Kratos to cross. Progressing further into the city, he briefly encountered the Athenian Oracle, who was then kidnapped by a pair of Harpies before she could speak to him. Giving chase, he soon found himself outside the Oracle's temple, where he observed a gravedigger (later revealed to be Zeus) digging a grave. Kratos inquired as to who would occupy it, to which the gravedigger answered that Kratos will. The Ghost of Sparta is alarmed by this answer, but the gravedigger reassures him that \"all will be revealed in good time, and when all appears to be lost, I will be there to help\". Progressing further into the temple, Kratos finds the Oracle dangling from a nearby cliff and rescues her. She immediately suspects that Kratos is motivated by something other than a desire to do good, and looks through his memories. The Oracle is horrified by Kratos' past deeds and asks why Athena would ever call on someone like him. Kratos angrily grabs the Oracle by the throat and throws her aside, telling her to stay out of his head. The Oracle informed Kratos that Pandora's box could be found in Pandora's Temple, located just beyond the Desert of Lost Souls on the back of the Titan Cronos. She warned the Ghost of Sparta that none have ever survived Pandora's temple, but Kratos is unfazed. A statue of Athena appeared before Kratos at the desert entrance, telling him that he must follow the song of the sirens and destroy all three before he can progress further. After doing so, he finds the\u00a0Titan Horn and uses it to summon Cronos. Kratos begins to climb the Titan, arriving at Pandora's temple three days later. Just outside the temple's entrance, he notices a gatekeeper (who is revealed to be the undead spirit of the first mortal to ever attempt Pandora's temple) tending to a pyre of dead bodies. As punishment for his failure, the gods forced him to watch over the entrance for all eternity, and burn the bodies of any soul foolish enough to try and conquer Pandora's temple. Believing Kratos would fail just like all the others, he disinterestedly wishes the Ghost of Sparta good luck before opening the gates. As the Spartan made his way through the temple, he encountered both Artemis and Hades, from whom he gained the Blade of Artemis and Souls of Hades, respectively. Along the way, he defeats countless monsters (including a giant armored Minotaur), survives impossible traps, and sacrifices a caged Athenian soldier before finally reaching Pandora's box, being the first human ever to do so. However, this did not escape the notice of Ares, who responded by hurling a large broken pillar towards Pandora's Temple,\u00a0impaling Kratos. The\u00a0Harpies collected Pandora's Box and took it back to Ares, while Kratos died and fell into the Underworld. As he plummeted to the River Styx, Kratos grabbed hold of the Captain's leg and used it to climb to safety before kicking him down below into the River Styx. Reaching the top again, Kratos managed to escape the clutches of Hades via the same hole that the Gravedigger had been digging earlier. He tells Kratos that Athena is not the only god watching over him\u00a0and that he still has one final task to complete before his sins are forgiven. Journeying through the now destroyed city of Athens, he reacquires Pandora's Box from Ares and uses it to grow tremendously in size and gain a substantial amount of power in order to battle Ares on more even footing. After a vicious fight, Ares traps Kratos in a psychological void where demonic incarnations of himself attempt to kill phantom versions of his family. Kratos successfully fights them off\u00a0but watches helplessly as Ares strips him of his Blades of Chaos and used them to kill his family again. Kratos, now distraught and vulnerable, nearly met his end at the hands of Ares, but soon took notice of the Blade of the Gods and used it to finally destroy the God of War. Though his past had been forgiven, the Gods refused to relieve him of his nightmares. His last bit of hope taken from him, Kratos attempted to commit suicide by jumping from a cliff. However, Athena had a different plan for the Spartan; she saved his life and offered him the now empty throne of the God of War on Olympus. He accepted the offer, sat upon the fallen god's throne, and became the new God of War.As the God of War  Kratos entered Tartarus once again in search of the Ambrosia in order to destroy it, for the Disciples of Ares desired to use it to resurrect their now dead God. Throughout his journey, Kratos received flashbacks of his first quest for the Ambrosia. Making his way through Tartarus, Kratos encountered and defeated a giant arachnid monster. After pulling his blades out from the beast, Athena spoke to him in an attempt to warn him about new dangers on the path he took once before. Kratos shrugged off her warnings, confident that nothing would stop him.   Later, he encountered Athena again and was told by the goddess that it is now the dead he must fear. Again, Kratos ignored her warnings, proceeding to find the dead bodies of Spartan soldiers who had accompanied him on his earlier quest for the Ambrosia. Rising from the dead, they attempted to kill Kratos in retaliation for abandoning them, although he defeated them all. The island then revealed itself to be a monstrous beast named Gyges, who sought revenge against Kratos after one hundred of his arms were burned off in his battle with Helios' Champion. Kratos, however, incinerated Gyges with the Flames of Apollo, destroying the Tree of Life and all of its Ambrosia. He then left the island, knowing that the disciples of Ares would hunt him down for destroying the last hope they had at reviving their fallen God. Sometime later, Kratos experienced visions of his mother being held at the Temple of Poseidon in Atlantis. En route to Poseidon's city, Athena attempted to dissuade Kratos from his mission, but her pleas fell on deaf ears. His ship was then attacked by the Scylla. Chasing the monster off, he received another vision, this time of his childhood training with his brother Deimos.  He entered the temple and encountered his long presumed dead mother Callisto, who assured Kratos that it is really her, to his shock. She then tells him that his father had taken her there and that Deimos is still alive; trapped and tortured in the Domain of Death. Both shocked and angered, Kratos asked who his father was and why she lied to him all those years ago. Before Callisto could tell him, she is transformed into a hideous beast, forcing Kratos to fight and critically wound her. Callisto used her dying moments to thank Kratos for setting her free\u00a0and encouraged him to pursue Deimos in Sparta. Enraged over the gods having taken yet another member of his family, Kratos embarked on a journey to save his brother, defiantly ignoring Athena's orders that he turn back. At one point, Kratos encountered the Titan Thera, imprisoned inside a volcano, who told him he would be incapable of leaving if he did not free her. After forcefully imbuing the Blades of Athena in the Titan's chest, Kratos obtained Thera's Bane and left the volcano. In releasing Thera, Atlantis' fate was sealed. Upon his descent, he impaled the Scylla, who had been pursuing him relentlessly ever since his arrival, finally defeating the monster. Before returning home, Kratos found himself under attack by Erinys, Thanatos' daughter. Following Erinys' defeat, Kratos returned to Sparta, killing the Piraeus Lion and a Dissenter before entering the Temple of Ares (then in the process of being converted into the Temple of Kratos), where he would find the key to saving his brother. The Spartan then made his way back to the sinking city of Atlantis, although his route was fraught with danger as Poseidon had unleashed an enormous whirlpool at sea and attempted to blast Kratos from the sky in retaliation for the destruction of his city. Kratos survived Poseidon's assault, only to be contacted telepathically by the Sea God via one of his broken statues, warning him that he would pay for what he had done to Atlantis. Sometime later, Athena inadvertently revealed to the Spartan that it was she, along with Ares, who had taken Deimos from him that day, justifying their actions on the grounds that he was a threat to Olympus. This revelation deepened Kratos' hatred for the Gods even further. Proceeding onward, Kratos entered the Domain of Death and the Temple of Thanatos where he finally found his brother Deimos. Kratos set Deimos free, only to be attacked by him, as Deimos blamed Kratos for not helping him when in dire need. Witnessing the battle from close by, Thanatos intervened and snatched Deimos. Barely able to stand from his fight with Deimos, Kratos followed Thanatos to the Suicide Bluffs and quickly rescued Deimos from falling to his death.  After being reunited and reconciling their differences, the Spartan brothers took arms and joined forces against Thanatos. The God of Death taunted the brothers, recalling the oracle's prophecy that a \"marked warrior\"\u00a0was destined to destroy Olympus. He comments that Zeus, Ares, and Athena chose the wrong \"marked warrior\" that day: it was Kratos who should have been taken away, not Deimos. Thanatos then said that it didn't matter anymore\u00a0and that nothing Kratos does is of his own choosing. Kratos shouted that no one, not even the gods decide his fate, to which Thanatos laughed and said the gods decide, and the Sisters of Fate make it so, further commenting that Kratos was nothing but a pawn in a game that he didn't know was being played.\u00a0In a climactic battle, Thanatos took Deimos' life, only to have an enraged Kratos take his in return. Kratos then took the lifeless body of his brother to his grave.  After putting Deimos in a grave dug by the enigmatic Grave Digger, Kratos stated that his brother was now free. He once again attempted to kill himself at the bluffs, but ultimately relented, asking himself what he had become. The Grave Digger, who had been close by, prophetically answered \"Death, the Destroyer of Worlds\" before vanishing. Athena then pleaded with Kratos to forgive her, and offered to empower him to full Godhood, but saw her pleas ignored, as Kratos promised her that the Gods would pay for their actions. Kratos began to isolate himself from the other Gods and spent most of his time assisting Sparta in its conquest of Greece. During a siege on an unknown city, he was attacked by Argos, Hera's pet. Before he could defeat the beast, however, an unknown Assassin killed it in his stead, apparently trying to destroy his reputation on Olympus. Kratos pursued the Assassin\u00a0but saw his progress halted by the minions of Hades, causing him to believe that the Assassin was Hades in disguise (this notion is further supported by the fact that Hades already resented Kratos for the death of his wife Persephone). The God of War continued his pursuit, only to be stopped by Ceryx, a messenger of the Gods, who allowed the Assassin to escape. On Zeus' orders, Ceryx told Kratos to cease his pursuit. Providing no valid reason, Ceryx only managed to infuriate the God of War. Kratos killed the messenger on the spot, instantly realizing that Zeus would not stand for this action. When Kratos sent his Spartan soldiers to conquer Rhodes, Athena implored him to stop, as the other Gods grew weary of his destructive behavior. Kratos, as usual, ignored her warning and instead plunged down to the Earth, aiding his army in further destroying the city. An eagle soon appeared and robbed Kratos of his immense size and a significant chunk of his godhood powers, reducing him to the size of an ordinary human. Despite this, he retained some of his god powers, enabling him to easily defeat the warriors of Rhodes. The eagle imbued Kratos' god powers into the Colossus of Rhodes, which was then brought to life.   Kratos fought a long and arduous battle with the giant until Zeus offered help in the form of the Blade of Olympus, which he himself used to end the Titan War. Infusing the remainder of his god powers and immortality into the blade, Kratos defeated the Colossus. As he shouted to the heavens, the statue's falling hand crushed him, knocking the Blade of Olympus out of his grasp. Severely wounded, and stripped of all of his powers, Kratos knew his only hope of survival lay with the Blade. Limping towards it, the eagle soon reappeared and revealed itself to be Zeus in disguise (Kratos originally believed Athena was responsible). Zeus informed Kratos that he didn't want to suffer the same fate as Ares, and demanded that Kratos surrender and serve him forever. However, when Kratos refused, Zeus attacked and killed him by driving the Blade into his abdomen. In his dying breath, Kratos swore that Zeus would pay for his treachery.Changing His Fate  Kratos was dragged down by the arms of the Underworld. The Titan Gaia, who had been watching him his entire life, saved Kratos, sealed his wound, and gave him the strength to escape death once again. Climbing out from the Underworld, he instructed the last surviving soldier to return to Sparta and prepare for battle. Kratos then took Pegasus, a gift from Gaia, and attempted to fly back to Olympus so he could exact his revenge, but discovered that he could no longer enter Olympus, as he was no longer a God. Instead, Gaia instructed Pegasus and Kratos to seek out the Sisters of Fate. She informed him that the Sisters had the power to travel back in time, which he could use to reclaim the Blade of Olympus and take his revenge on Zeus. Kratos first traveled to Typhon's lair, where he met with Prometheus, who begged him to release him from his torment in the Fires of Olympus. Kratos, after stealing Typhon's Bane from the Titan, used it to break Prometheus' last chain, sending him down into the flames, burning him alive and finally releasing him. His ashes granted him the power of the Titans.   Kratos then made his way to the Island of Creation, where the Pegasus was attacked by a pack of Griffins. After defeating the undead soldier who led the pack of griffins, Kratos made a death defying leap off of Pegasus and onto the Island. As he continued his journey, he questioned Gaia over her reason for aiding him. Gaia then tells him the story of the Titanomachy and how the Olympians betrayed her and overthrew the Titans. Armed with this knowledge, Kratos continued his quest and soon encountered Theseus, who guarded the Steeds of Time. Theseus laughed and mocked Kratos' quest to destroy Zeus and challenged him to a fight, wanting to see who was the greatest warrior in all of Greece. Theseus was defeated after Kratos skewered him with his own spear and repeatedly slammed the door shut on his head. Kratos then used the Horse Keeper's Key to gain control of the steeds, moving the temple of the sisters of fate closer and connecting the two together.  Kratos made his way through the Bog of the Forgotten where he encountered an undead foe from his past, the Barbarian King. Having escaped Hades' torment, he traveled to the Island of Creation for two reasons: to change his fate and exact revenge on Kratos. They engaged in a fierce duel, with Alrik summoning the souls of the dead (including the Captain) with his mighty hammer. Eventually, these souls were either destroyed (again, including the Captain) or absorbed by Alrik, using them to increase his size. Ultimately, Kratos shrunk the king back down, seized Alrik's hammer and used it to crush his skull, killing him once more. Looking upon Alrik's corpse, memories of Kratos' past came back to haunt him, but he pressed on anyway. Entering Euryale's temple, he obtained the Golden Fleece from a wounded soldier (whom he then sacrificed by throwing his body under a cog, jamming it), which could deflect enemy attacks. Kratos used this weapon to defeat a nearby Cerberus and, eventually, Euryale herself. Enraged at Kratos for decapitating her sister Medusa, Euryale fought with great ferocity\u00a0but was defeated when Kratos pulled her own head off as well. With the Gorgon sister's death, Kratos used Head of Euryale to turn his enemies into stone. Progressing further, he soon came across another statue of Athena, who implored him not to trust Gaia and to cease his quest for vengeance. As usual, Kratos ignored her warnings and pressed on.   Soon afterward, Kratos encountered his half-brother Perseus, who was on a quest to save his beloved Andromeda from Hades. Perseus challenged the Ghost of Sparta to a fight, believing it would prove his worth to the Sisters of Fate and allow him to rescue Andromeda; or, if not that, would at least allow him to \"bathe in the glory of being the one to bring down the mighty Kratos\". However, Perseus was no match for Kratos, who made short work of the legendary Greek hero by breaking all of his equipment and impaling him on a large hook. Kratos then took his shield and used it to enter the Courtyard of Atropos. Reaching the Great Chasm, he was confronted by an elderly Icarus, who had by this point lost his sanity.  Icarus tries to get Kratos to stop his quest, rambling on about how it is \"MY TEST!!!\" while telling him that he would never make it across the chasm. Annoyed, Kratos tries to push him aside, but this does not deter Icarus. He continues to get in Kratos' way and yell about the futility of his quest, telling the Ghost of Sparta that \"THIS IS MY TEST\" and that only he can fly across the chasm and receive an audience with theSisters of Fate. Kratos takes hold of his throat and declares \"I will make it to the Sisters of Fate and I will use your wings to do so.\" Icarus tackles Kratos, causing them both to fall off the ledge and plummet to Underworld. Their fight continued as they fell, but ended when Kratos ripped off Icarus' Wings and drop-kicked him down in the Underworld, sealing his fate. However, Kratos managed to fly to safety by landing on Atlas. Gaia then told him that he needed to return to the surface, prompting Kratos to travel across Atlas' body and destroy part of his chains. This relieved some of the Titan's burden\u00a0but called attention to Kratos' presence. He scolded Kratos for having the nerve to show his face to him again, after what he had done. Intent on crushing the former God for his imprisonment, Atlas ultimately ceased his attempt to kill Kratos when he revealed that he was now an enemy of Zeus, and sought to change his fate in order to destroy the King of the Gods. Atlas told Kratos more about the Great War and how it ended when Zeus created the Blade of Olympus. Atlas gave Kratos some of his power and lifted him back to the surface, where he continued his journey into the Palace of Fates. There, he took two scholars hostage and forced them to read an incantation that Kratos himself could not read before ultimately sacrificing them both. Soon afterwards, he encountered the last remaining Spartan warrior, only this time shrouded in darkness. With neither of them aware of who they were facing, both warriors engaged in battle, intending to reaching the Sisters themselves. Eventually, the Last Spartan fell prey to Kratos' Blades as they tumbled out of the stained glass window into the light, revealing their identities to each other. The Spartan warrior informed Kratos of the fact that Zeus had destroyed Sparta before succumbing to his wounds, causing Kratos to be overtaken with anger and shout to the Heavens. Blinded by rage, he was then attacked by the Kraken, providing little resistance as it proceeded to strangle him. Held firm in its grasp, Kratos then saw an astral projection of his wife, which was actually Gaia in disguise, encouraging him to go on and tell him that Hades will torment him for all eternity if he dies. She told Kratos that the Titans wanted him to lead them into battle before empowering him with the Rage of the Titans. Kratos, ultimately regaining his will to live, engaged the Kraken in battle and killed it. Then, using the Phoenix, he made his way to the Sister's main stronghold. Kratos entered the Sister's throne room and met with Lahkesis, who told him that the Fates decided upon the destinies of all, and how it was she who allowed him to come as far as he did. She then proclaimed that it was not his destiny to kill Zeus. By this point, Kratos had no interest in negotiation, telling her that they no longer had any control over his destiny, ultimately threatening to kill her if she did not let him pass. This enraged Lakhesis, who then engaged the Ghost of Sparta in battle. Kratos almost immediately gained the upper hand and inflicted heavy damage on Lakhesis, infuriating her even further. She summoned her sister Atropos, who took Kratos back in time to his battle with Ares, attempting to destroy the Blade of the Gods so that his past and present self would cease to exist. Kratos subdued her before teleporting himself back to the present. Lakhesis grew ever more frustrated and engaged once more, only now with Atropos in tow. After a long and hard battle, he trapped them in both a time void and shattered it, erasing them for good. Kratos then proceeded on to Clotho, who implored him not to go forward with his manipulation of fate. Kratos, having pinned all of Clotho's lower body parts to the ground, ascended to the top platform and impaled her with one of her own instruments, instantly killing her. Kratos then took control of his own life thread in the Loom Chamber, proceeding back in time to the point where Zeus betrayed him. Once there, Kratos immediately charged at Zeus and tackled him. Shocked by Kratos' sudden reappearance, Zeus assumed that the Sisters of Fate had helped him somehow But as Kratos pulled the Blade of Olympus out of his past self, he informed Zeus that all three Sisters are dead. Zeus then commented that he had underestimated Kratos, but that he would not do so again. Both men charged at each other, engaging in a vicious battle through the skies before landing on the Summit of Sacrifice, where Zeus soon reappeared in his full God form. Zeus summoned an army of sirens to aid him while hurling lightning bolts at Kratos, only for the Ghost of Sparta to use the sirens to paralyze Zeus and plunge the Blade of Olympus into his oversized hand. Infuriated, Zeus elected to shrink back down to mortal size and engage Kratos directly. The God eventually manages to take the Blade away from Kratos, only to lose it once more as Kratos drives the blade into Zeus' abdomen and throws him against a nearby set of standing rocks. Zeus soon manages to swipe the Blade of Olympus out of Kratos' hands a second time\u00a0but loses it again when Kratos impales Zeus with the blade and throws him against another set of standing rocks. The Ghost of Sparta then ascends the structure and drops the top slab onto Zeus, greatly infuriating the God. Zeus, having had enough, reverts to his full Olympian size and unleashes a powerful lightning storm on Kratos. Yielding defeat, Kratos put down the Blade of Olympus and asked the King of Gods to release him from his torment, to which Zeus responded: \"I will release you from your life, my son, but your torment is just beginning\" before moving in to kill the Spartan. However, this is revealed to have been a trick by Kratos, who then deflected the blow, slammed Zeus' head against a nearby rock before pinning Zeus down with his Blades. Taking the Blade of Olympus back, Kratos furiously drove it into Zeus' abdomen, intending to kill Zeus in the same way he had killed Kratos in Rhodes. Athena appeared moments later and charged at Kratos, begging him to stop. Zeus then took advantage of the situation and tried to flee, but this did not escape Kratos' notice. The enraged Spartan made one final attempt on his life, only for Athena to jump in the way and take the blow herself. A distraught Kratos asked Athena why she sacrificed herself, to which she replied: \"to save Olympus\". She further revealed to Kratos that Zeus is his father and that his actions were driven by fear. Zeus' intention was to finally break the cycle of patricide by killing Kratos, whom he now recognized as the \"Marked Warrior\" destined to bring about the final destruction of Olympus. Athena begged Kratos to forfeit his quest for revenge, warning him that all of Olympus would unite against him and that should he succeed in killing Zeus, the world would be destroyed. By this point, Kratos' sanity and compassion for others had been completely drained, and he vowed to destroy all of the Gods along with anyone else who stood in his way. Traveling back in time to the Titanomachy, he brought the Titans with him to the present and led them forth to Mount Olympus to confront the Gods one last time. Meanwhile, a badly weakened Zeus calls forth a meeting of the Gods (although only Poseidon, Hades, Hermes, and Helios are present), urging them to put aside their differences and unite against their common enemy, Kratos. Moments later, Mount Olympus begins to tremble as the Gods look down in horror at the ascending Titans, who are now accompanied by Kratos. The Ghost of Sparta yells out to his father, declaring that the reign of the Olympians is now over.The Second Great War  Zeus immediately ordered his fellow Olympians, along with his demigod son Hercules, to attack Kratos and his Titan allies, although Zeus himself opted to stay out of the fray for the time being as he was still recovering from his last battle with Kratos. The Olympians initially had the upper hand, however, as Hades successfully dislodged several Titans with his claws, while Poseidon shot down from Olympus like a torpedo and struck a death blow through Epimetheus' chest, sending the Titan to his grave. Moments later, Poseidon resurfaced within a colossal watery construct in his image, spawning several Hippocampi to aid him in battle. With Poseidon as their greatest threat, having already decimated numerous Titans and now going after Gaia herself, Kratos engaged the God of the Sea in a vicious battle. Kratos freed Gaia from Poseidon's Hippocampi, allowing her to grab the Sea God and slam him into the mountain. With Poseidon pinned down, Kratos moved in to attack. The enraged Spartan pounded Poseidon with his blades, while the God tried to defend himself with his trident. Eventually, Kratos shattered the massive rock formation on Poseidon's chest, exposing his weak spot.   Poseidon broke free of Gaia's grasp by attacking her with more Hippocampi. However, the Spartan quickly broke Poseidon's hold over Gaia, allowing her to throw a devastating punch which sent Kratos on a collision course with the god of the sea, knocking him out of his watery construct and onto a nearby cliff. Kratos grabbed Poseidon and threw him against the rocks, watching as his water construct disintegrated and collapsed into the sea. As the Ghost of Sparta moved in to finish him off, Poseidon told Kratos that no matter how many gods fall, there would always be another to stand against him. Unfazed, Kratos retorted that any god who gets in his way will meet the same fate. Poseidon, realizing just how insane and vengeful Kratos has become, warned him to relent, stating that the death of Olympus would mean the end of the (Grecian) world. Kratos, again, is unfazed, and coldly responds: \"Then prepare for YOUR death, Poseidon\". Kratos then grabbe Poseidon by his neck and battered him uncontrollably, slamming his uncle's head against the rocks before throwing him against a large boulder. In desperation, a visibly terrified Poseidon attempted to crawl away and escape back into the sea, but Kratos easily caught up with him, gouged his eyes out, and snapped his neck before tossing his corpse off the mountain. With Poseidon's death, the seas unleashed a cataclysmic flood that engulfed all of Greece, drowning almost all of the Greeks, save for those on Olympia and other mountaintop locations. The Spartan climbed back onto Gaia's hand and they both continued onward to Zeus' pavilion, where the King of the Gods angrily anticipated Kratos' arrival. Gaia wrapped her palm around Zeus' platform, trapping him there as an eager Kratos jumped down from Gaia's hand to confront Zeus. The enraged Spartan taunted the King of the Gods, reminding him that with Athena's death, there was no one left to protect him. In response, Zeus told Kratos that Athena died because of his blind rage, asking him how far he was willing to go to sate his need for vengeance. Kratos then boasted that neither the Sisters of Fate nor the gates of Hades could stop him, ultimately declaring that Zeus would not live to see the next sunrise. As Kratos and Gaia prepared to attack, Zeus summoned a massive bolt of lightning which he used to knock both Kratos and Gaia off of the mountain, in the hopes they would fall into the River Styx below. The resulting blast tore off a portion of Gaia's arm, causing her to struggle to maintain her grip. Kratos urged Gaia to help him as he too was losing his grip, but the Titan refused, claiming that doing so would cause both of them to fall off the mountain. Kratos reminded her of why she saved him from death, to which Gaia replied that he was nothing more than a pawn whom they no longer needed, as the Titans had finally reached Zeus. Betrayed yet again, Kratos plummeted from the mountain and found himself stranded in the Underworld once more. Contemplating his life as he lurched through the River Styx and its caverns, he resolved to escape Hades and destroy Zeus once and for all. After being drained of nearly all of his power by the dead souls of the River Styx, he met the ghost of Athena, who claimed to have reached a \"higher existence\" and offered to help Kratos exact his revenge on Zeus. Suspicious of this turn of events, Kratos demanded to know why she had such a sudden change of heart as she died protecting Zeus. Athena then explained to Kratos how she saw truths where she did not before, and to regain his trust, she transformed Kratos' ruined blades into the Blades of Exile, which would help him survive the Underworld and the foes that awaited him. She then instructs him to find and extinguish the Flame of Olympus, claiming that it is the source of Zeus' power.   Kratos made his way through the Underworld, meeting lost souls, stealing Apollo's bow from Peirithous by burning him alive, and encountering The Judges, who decided that Kratos was not yet ready for the afterlife before urging him to proceed forward. Along the way, he would encounter a statue of Pandora, which called out to Kratos. Initially mistaking its voice for Calliope's, he soon realized that it was someone else and tried to walk away. Before he could, the voice claimed to know all about Kratos, telling him that everybody on Olympus was terrified of him, to which Kratos replied: \"there are reasons for that\". Pandora tried to tell him more, but she was interrupted by the voice of Hades, who mocked Kratos. The Spartan ordered Hades to reveal himself, only for the God of the Underworld to reply that Kratos was too impatient and that soon enough, they would have their time to play. Descending deeper into the depths of the Underworld, he encountered a despairing Hephaestus, the Craftsman of Olympus as well as the God of Volcanoes and Fire, who blamed Kratos for his exile to the Underworld as well as the disappearance of his daughter Pandora. Despite his grievances, however, Hephaestus was passive and did not attack Kratos, even offering him helpful information about the secrets of Olympus, his adopted daughter Pandora, and Zeus. Progressing further into Hades' kingdom, Kratos occasionally found mysterious notes that he silently acknowledged as being from various people in his past. He eventually found and entered Hades' Palace, using the coffin-wed body of Persephone that Hades had restored to open a pathway into a dark room where he would encounter the Lord of the Underworld himself. Once there, Hades recounted his grievances against the Ghost of Sparta, blaming him for the deaths of Athena, Poseidon, and especially his beloved queen Persephone (seemingly unaware of or indifferent to her hatred for him, and her plot to destroy the world) before telling the Spartan that he would make him suffer for all of the pain he has caused him. Emerging from the darkness, Hades tried to rip Kratos' soul out of his body and absorb it, but was unsuccessful. As the room lit up, Kratos immediately engaged the God of the Underworld, viciously tearing off and destroying chunks of his flesh before he could reacquire them and heal himself. As the battle wore on, Kratos used his blades to carve up Hades' neck in an attempt to remove his helmet, which only enraged the Underworld God further. Hades responded by tearing open a crevice in the ground, hoping to pull Kratos into the River Styx. However, Kratos intercepted Hades' claw with one of his blades, ensnaring the two weapons together and initiating a tug of war. With his other blade still free, Kratos continued to fend off Hades' attacks and damage him even more as the enraged god promised Kratos that his death would only be the beginning of his suffering. The Ghost of Sparta continued to have the upper hand, damaging Hades to the point where he could easily fire his other blade and use it to form a noose around Hades' neck. Kratos proceeded to slam his uncle's head into the roof until his helmet was finally dislodged, robbing him of his Claws and causing him to plummet into the River Styx in the process.  The Underworld God was not finished, however, drastically increasing his size and emerging from the River Styx in a last ditch effort to destroy his enemy once and for all. Using Hades' own claws against him, Kratos further weakened the God of the Underworld and attached the claws to his now exposed, damaged skull, ripping the soul right out of his body, killing him. Hades' death caused all of the souls in the Underworld to run rampant, tearing a giant hole in his abdomen which Kratos used to escape the area. Now in possession of Hades' soul, Kratos gained the ability to swim through the River Styx unharmed and use the Hyperion Gate at will. Kratos once again emerged in Hephaestus' lair. The Smith God then asked Kratos if Hades was truly dead, to which Kratos responded in the affirmative. Hephaestus laughed in approval, claiming that Hades deserved to suffer but thought his death was impossible. Imparting more information to the Ghost of Sparta, Kratos bade farewell to Hephaestus and used a Hyperion Gate to escape from the Underworld.   Back on Mount Olympus, on the outskirts of the city of Olympia, Helios rode by on his chariot and threw some fireballs at Kratos, prompting him to give chase. In the process, he encountered a struggling Gaia, who was amazed by his survival and asked Kratos to help her. Remembering Gaia's earlier betrayal, he adamantly refused to help her, instead severing her arm as she desperately asked Kratos if she meant nothing to him. The Ghost of Sparta retorted in a show of cruel irony it was, in fact, Gaia who was the pawn, his pawn while telling a pleading Gaia that the war against Zeus was \"his war\" and not hers. Kratos then destroyed the root of Gaia's hand with the Blade of Olympus, sending a screaming Gaia plummeting to her presumed death. Later, he finds Helios engaged in a battle with the Titan Perses. Using a nearby catapult, he knocked the Sun God into Perses' grasp. The Titan then crushed him in his hand and threw him across the city. The Spartan proceeded to hunt Helios down and finish him off.  He eventually found Helios, but the badly injured Sun God summoned a phalanx of shield-carrying soldiers to shelter him from Kratos' onslaught. The Spartan took control of a nearby Cyclops and used it to eliminate the phalanx completely. With no other options left, Helios tried to trick Kratos into sparing his life with a promise that he would repay him in full. Although suspicious, Kratos considered the offer and asked Helios where he could find the Flame of Olympus. Helios refused to provide a straight answer, instead warning him of the futility of his quest, to which Kratos responds \"of all the lives you should worry about Helios, mine is not one of them\". With his guard lowered, Helios attempted to blind Kratos with a beam of sunlight. Although this momentarily stunned him, Kratos blocked out the sunlight long enough to make his way back to Helios and begin stomping his head. The Sun God soon relented and told Kratos that in order to receive the Flame's power, he must step into the Flame itself. However, Kratos immediately knew that this was a lie, as Hephaestus had already told him that the Flame is lethal to both mortals and Gods alike. Helios tries in vain to dissuade Kratos from believing the Smith God, calling him a \"freak that has fallen from the graces of Olympus\", but Kratos responds that this is exactly why he believed the Smith God in the first place. Having run out of options, Helios resigned himself to his fate, although he remained defiant to the end, telling the Spartan that his death would not lead him to Zeus, to which Kratos disagrees.  The Spartan then grabbed the Sun God and pulled his head off with his bare hands, causing the sun to be permanently veiled by dark clouds and rain storms. Although Helios was now dead, his head could still emit intense sunlight, and Kratos used it as a lantern to light his way through the dark caverns of Mount Olympus. Perses attacked the Spartan on his way up the mountain (presumably to avenge Gaia), forcing Kratos to kill him. As Kratos reached the Labyrinth, he was confronted by Hermes, who joyously teased and mocked the Spartan warrior both for his past failures and the foolishness of his current vendetta against Zeus. Kratos attempted to ignore Hermes at first, believing him to be nothing more than a \"fly from the ass of Zeus\", but Hermes continued to provoke him, stating that the only reason he doesn't provide chase is because he knows he will never catch him, before speeding his way up the Chain of Balance away from Kratos. The Ghost of Sparta slowly ascended the Chain of Balance until he reached a chamber containing Pandora's Box. Surprised to see the box, Athena soon appeared and told him that there is a dormant, unused power inside that he will need to defeat Zeus, although the box was inaccessible due to it being sealed off and engulfed by the Flame of Olympus. Athena further explained that in order to quell the Flame, he would need the box's namesake, Pandora herself. Hermes reappeared the moment Athena departed\u00a0and provoked Kratos into chasing him. Along the way, Hermes childishly mocked and belittled Kratos for his lack of speed and his perceived stupidity. Although he was reasonably successful in providing chase, Hermes soon found a narrow chain leading to the head of a large statue which Kratos could reach. Hermes sped across the large chasm and made his way to the top of the statue, telling Kratos to \"keep up\". Greatly underestimating the mortal, Hermes was soon knocked from his perch and severely weakened after Kratos used a nearby catapult to destroy the statue. He also used his blades to attach himself to the catapult fodder, using it to close in on Hermes.  After the statue collapsed, Kratos noticed a leftover blood trail and used it to corner a now defenseless Hermes. The Spartan made short work of the Speed God, who then bitterly insulted him for his lack of honor and the terrible things he has done. Kratos then grabbed Hermes and sliced off one of his legs, watching as the humiliated God attempted to squirm away before slowly approaching him and brutally cutting off his half-brother's other leg. The loss of both of Hermes' legs resulted in his death\u00a0and caused a deadly plague to spread across the land, affecting all human, animal, and plant life. Kratos took Hermes' boots, using them to traverse wide chasms and proceed further into the halls of Olympus.  Eventually arriving in an empty forum, Kratos encountered a drunken Hera, who ordered his half-brother Hercules to destroy him as she watched from above. Hercules expressed resentment towards Kratos, claiming that Zeus had always favored him before stating his desire to kill Kratos (calling it his 13th and final labor) and claim the God of War throne for himself. Kratos told Hercules that his aspirations are a waste of time since the reign of Olympus is coming to an end. Hercules replied \"we will see about that\" before ordering his legions to attack Kratos. Easily besting his undead warriors, Hercules himself joined the fray, using the Cestus he acquired from his conquest of the Nemean Lion to fight Kratos while ordering his legions to swarm him, allowing Hercules a clean hit. After a long and brutal fight, Kratos grabbed Hercules and carried him to the beds of spikes lining the forum walls, throwing him into them and tearing off all of his armor. This only served to provoke Hercules, who then killed all of his legions with an earthquake punch and engaged Kratos one on one. As the fight went on, Hercules grew increasingly impatient and clanged both of his Cestus together, temporarily stunning Kratos. Hercules took this opportunity to brag to Hera about his impending victory, only for Kratos to attack him from behind and take Cestus away from him. Now with no weapons, Hercules tried to best his half-brother using his bare hands and legendary strength, hurling portions of the forum wall at Kratos and eventually lifting the floor out from underneath him in the hopes of causing the Ghost of Sparta to fall to his death. Kratos used the Cestus to climb back up onto the platform before punching it back down on top of Hercules, trapping him underneath. Kratos proceeded to beat his half-brother to death with the Cestus, mutilating and completely destroying his face until the floor beneath them broke, causing them both to plummet to the sewers underground. Later, he encountered a radiant Aphrodite and her handmaidens in the goddess' chamber. Aphrodite did not seem to care about Kratos' war on Olympus and asked the Spartan to have sex with her. After some initial hesitation, Kratos indulged Aphrodite before using the nearby Hyperion Gate to visit Hephaestus, who sarcastically asked Kratos if his wife \"had conquered another God of War\". Kratos did not answer his question, telling him that it is a matter between Hephaestus and his wife, before questioning the Smith God on the whereabouts of Pandora. Hephaestus, knowing full well what Kratos intends to do with Pandora, demanded that he stay away from her, telling him that it's his fault that she is imprisoned in the Labyrinth and the reason that Hephaestus was exiled to Hades. Kratos insists that he has never wronged Hephaestus, but the Smith God tells him that by opening Pandora's box in his quest to destroy Ares, Zeus became infected with Fear and surmised that Hephaestus was hiding something from him. Zeus tortured the Smith God until he confessed to the creation of Pandora, a key to the box which had taken on a life of its own, with Hephaestus loving her as if she was his own daughter. Zeus took Pandora away from him and banished Hephaestus to Hades. Seemingly unmoved, Kratos insisted that he will stop at nothing to obtain his revenge. Hephaestus then decided that the only way to stop Kratos would be to send him on a suicide mission. To this end, he asked Kratos to retrieve the Omphalos stone (unbeknownst to Kratos, it was contained in the belly of the Titan Cronos), promising to make him a special weapon with it.   Having journeyed through Tartarus, he found the severed hand of Gaia resting in the palm of Cronos, who immediately accused Kratos of murdering Gaia. Blaming him for the torment he now suffers in Tartarus (Zeus banished Cronos thereafter Kratos conquered the Temple of Pandora), Cronos attempted to kill the Ghost of Sparta. Initially attempting to crush Kratos between his fingers, the Spartan used Helios' head to temporarily blind Cronos and escape death. Landing on Cronos' arm, he went unnoticed by the Titan until he scaled his arm and destroys a massive pimple. Cronos made several more attempts to flatten Kratos with his hand, only to have one of his fingernails dislodged, causing great pain to the Titan. After scaling Cronos' hand, Kratos once again blinded the Titan before making his way to the belt that kept Pandora's Temple chained to his back. Kratos opened the belt and attempted to remove the crystal nail holding Pandora's Temple in place before Cronos grabbed him and attempted to smash Kratos between his palms. Kratos survived, however, by plunging the Blade of Olympus into one of his palms, eventually making his way to Cronos' shoulder joint. After using a skinless Cyclops to damage Cronos further, the Titan decided to eat Kratos, who then took the Omphalos stone from his stomach and used the Blade of Olympus to escape, spilling the Titan's entrails in the process. Cronos begged the Spartan to leave, as he now had what he came for.  However, Kratos ignored his pleas and once again made his way to Cronos' belt, dislodging the nail and driving it into Cronos' chin. Now in tremendous pain, Cronos called Kratos a \"coward\" who \"murders his own kin\". Kratos then stabbed his grandfather in the forehead with a completely charged Blade of Olympus, killing him. The corpse of Cronos collapsed just above Hephaestus' lair, and Kratos angrily accused the Smith God of sending him on a suicide mission. Hephaestus pleaded innocence, claiming that he knew Kratos could handle himself, before taking the Omphalos stone and forging the Nemesis Whip. Hephaestus then tried to electrocute Kratos with his Ring in a final attempt to kill him, shouting \"Here is your retribution!\". Kratos managed to shake off the effect and kill Hephaestus by impaling him on his own anvil. In his dying words, the Smith God begged Kratos to spare his daughter, as well as begging for Pandora's forgiveness, after which he passed away. However, Kratos appeared to bear no ill will towards Hephaestus as he knew the sentiment behind his betrayal, as he later told Pandora that Hephaestus had done what any father should: protecting the life of his child. Using the Nemesis Whip to make his way through the Gardens of Olympus, he encountered a depressed and drunken Hera once more. Blaming Kratos for the deterioration of her garden along with all other forms of life on Earth, she ineffectually struck him but was easily pushed aside. She then taunted Kratos by telling him that his simple mind would never find a way out of the garden, although he eventually did. Deeper into the garden, Kratos encountered Hera one more time, and she continued to express her hatred for him because of what he was doing to the planet. Kratos tried to ignore her and continue on until she called Pandora a \"little whore\", causing him to choke her and brutally snap Hera's neck. Her death caused all plant life to wither and die.  Kratos returned to the Labyrinth and met an imprisoned Daedalus, who was the Labyrinth's main architect. Zeus promised him that he would have his son Icarus back once he completed the Labyrinth, but instead imprisoned him in one of the Labyrinth's traps. Nevertheless, Daedalus continued to delude himself into believing that Icarus was still alive and that Zeus would come through. His hopes were ultimately crushed when Kratos revealed that Icarus was dead (although the Spartan neglected to mention that he was the one who killed him by ripping off his wings and allowing him to fall into Hades), causing Daedalus to sob uncontrollably. Soon afterward, and despite Daedalus' pleas, Kratos pulled a lever in order to progress, ultimately setting off a trap that killed the poor inventor. Moments later, he rescued Pandora from the Labyrinth and took her with him. Initially believing her to be nothing more than an object, she reminded Kratos so much of his daughter that he grew to care for her as his own child. With Pandora in his possession, he had one final task ahead of him: neutralize the Three Judges. To this end, he travels back to the (now completely abandoned) Underworld and severed the Chain of Balance, destroying the Three Judges in the process. Making his way back up to the Flame's chamber, he raised the Labyrinth so that Pandora's box could be accessed. At this point, Kratos began to have second thoughts and refused to let Pandora sacrifice her life. Pandora resisted, telling Kratos that she did not want to be treated as a child and that she needed to embrace her destiny, only to be interrupted and apprehended by Zeus himself. Kratos ordered Zeus to let go of Pandora, only for the King of the Gods to refuse and berate him over his apparent obsession with Pandora, referring to her as an \"object\". Zeus told Kratos that he should not confuse Pandora with his own flesh and blood, but mused that he already had. He cited the destruction of Olympus and the world as proof of Kratos' need for atonement before expressing absolute horror at his son's actions, telling him to look around at what he has done. Kratos, in turn, snarled that he only saw what he had come to destroy. Zeus then expressed regret over taking pity on Kratos, calling it the \"greatest mistake\" he had ever made, before telling Kratos that taking pity on Pandora would be his greatest mistake. Kratos angrily insisted that it had nothing to do with her, with Zeus replying that it had everything to do with her. The increasingly agitated Spartan once again ordered Zeus to put her down, to which he responds by callously tossing her aside. Father and son engaged in battle once more as Olympus continued to crumble around them. Meanwhile, Pandora tried to run into the Flame, intent on pacifying it, although Kratos attempted to stop her. However, Zeus inadvertently provoked Kratos into letting her go by stating that he should not fail her like he failed his family, causing Kratos to attack Zeus in a fit of extreme rage. Kratos then opened the Box once again, only to discover that it was empty. Zeus then mocked him for \"another stunning failure\" and went outside to recover, while Kratos' fury boiled even further. Outside, father and son met again on the pavilion. Zeus, overlooking the destruction his son caused, mused that he would have a lot of work to do after defeating Kratos, who urged his father to face him in combat, stating \"it is time to end this\", to which Zeus agrees. But before either could claim victory, the platform suddenly began to tremble as a reawakened Gaia grabbed hold of the pavilion. Kratos expressed shock at her survival, only for Gaia to blame the Ghost of Sparta for the destruction of her planet (not realizing that Kratos and Gaia shared the same goal of destroying the gods, and that the destruction he caused would have happened anyway). She attempted to crush the pavilion between her hands, declaring that father and son would die together. Seeing no other exit, Zeus and Kratos were forced to enter the wound on Gaia's chest (still present from her battle with Poseidon) and dueled near\u00a0Gaia's heart, sucking the life out of it. Kratos managed to kill both Zeus and Gaia by simultaneously impaling both with the Blade of Olympus. Awakening amidst the cracked earth, Kratos tried to leave, but Zeus' still active spirit, consumed by some lasting hatred for his infidel son and empowered by Fear, attacked Kratos, draining him of his willpower and anger, and instead of filling him with fear and loss, bringing him to the verge of death. Trapped inside his own mind and tortured by his memories, Kratos was aided by the spirit of Pandora, who helped him abolish the various torments of his soul. With her help, Kratos finally forgave himself for killing his family and Athena before he\u00a0dove into The Pool of Blood and confronted his inner demons in the form of his slain victims. Overcoming these hurdles with the power\u00a0Hope, Kratos returned to the physical world and with a stronger resolve, he managed to free himself from Zeus' choking grip. He then furiously attacked Zeus' spirit, ultimately forcing it back into his own body, temporarily resurrecting a weakened Zeus. Kratos then realized that Zeus was now so weak that he no longer needed the Blades to kill him. The Spartan cast his weapons aside and charged at Zeus, who attempted to hold Kratos back. However, he easily broke through Zeus' defenses and slammed him against a rock, causing black smoke (presumably Fear) to escape from Zeus' mouth. Kratos then furiously beat Zeus to death with his bare hands, thus finally fulfilling his goals of revenge and signifying the end of the Olympians' reign once and for all. The chains around Kratos' arms loosened as Zeus' body exploded, plunging the world into complete chaos. With the reign of Olympus now over, Kratos looked out over the horizon and finally came to realize just what he had done. Arriving to congratulate Kratos, Athena asked him to turn over the power he claimed from Pandora's Box, stating that mankind was now ready to hear her message. Kratos responded that the world now stands in ruin, and therefore whatever message she has is now useless. Athena once again told him to give her what he found in Pandora's box, only for Kratos to tell her that the box was empty. However, Athena saw the power in his eyes and told him that she was the one who put the powers of Hope inside the box. Kratos reflected that Pandora had died in vain, only to serve his need for vengeance. He was consumed with grief over her death, as well as the death of the world around him.   Athena ordered Kratos to return the power he had obtained, as she believed it rightfully belonged to her. For now that the world was cleansed by chaos, she would rebuild it under her rule, using the power of hope. She then quickly came to realize, however, that when Kratos first opened the box to kill Ares, the evils were released and infected the gods of Olympus, whereas she initially believed that all of the evils went into Kratos. As the evils took hold of the gods, the power of hope instead infused itself into Kratos. Buried underneath all of the years of guilt, anger, and need for revenge, Hope was finally released when Kratos learned to forgive his past deeds, thus releasing its power. Kratos, wracked with guilt over the world's destruction and realizing that he had nowhere else to go and nothing left to live for, committed suicide by impaling himself with the Blade of Olympus. As a result, the power of Hope was inadvertently released into the mortal world, angering Athena. The Goddess told him how disappointed she is, to which he merely responded with a tiny smirk and a faint laugh. She then pulled the Blade out of Kratos' body and disappeared, leaving a heavily breathing Kratos to die. The wounded Spartan then laid himself down, laughing softly as he lowered his head down the ground, and slept in a pool of his own blood, his breathing echoing throughout the end, seemingly ready in letting death grab his soul.  However, in a post-credits scene, the eagle-engraved mural where Kratos died is shown deserted, with a trail of blood leading off the cliff. The Ghost of Sparta, having somehow survived, discovered that he is cursed to walk the Earth forever as punishment for his terrible deeds. Seeing no reason to remain in Greece, he picked up his lost Blades of Chaos and traveled north, hoping to leave the wreckage of his past behind him.A New Beginning  Several years after the destruction of Olympus, Kratos lives a secluded life in a remote forest of Norway, the realm of the Norse gods. It is revealed that the chaos caused by Kratos only destroyed Greece instead\u00a0of the entire world, and different mythologies are separated geographically. He eventually met Faye, his future second wife, while trying to retrieve the Leviathan Axe in a nearby forest. They soon gave birth to a son named Atreus, although Faye initially wanted to name him Loki. The boy was raised mainly by Faye, who taught him how to hunt and how to read the Nordic language, among other things. Per Faye's request, Kratos never took Atreus hunting since the boy was constantly sick. In an effort to practice control, Kratos would often \"test\" himself by venturing into the woods in search of enemies. While Faye thought Kratos was looking to pick fights, Kratos was actually seeking to control his rage by not fighting and only defending and deflecting attacks until his enemies tire themselves out. It is implied he failed repeatedly until,\u00a0in one instance, he encountered wolves and succeeded in fending them off. However, trolls appeared and were able to push Kratos to the point he lost control and he slaughtered the trolls with ease, causing Kratos great anger with himself. Kratos would continue to \"test\" himself, resulting in Kratos not being home very often. This led Atreus to believe Kratos does not care about him or Faye. Kratos rarely instructed Atreus to perform any chores since he was always away and did not know how healthy Atreus was. Instead, he reinforced Faye's instructions such as when Faye told Atreus to cut some firewood, Kratos (after forcing it out of Atreus) enforced the decision and told Atreus to\u00a0pull his weight.The Journey The Marked Trees  A couple of years later, Faye died for unexplained reasons and requested that her family take her cremated ashes to the highest peak in the Nine Realms. She also wished that Kratos would take her place in raising their son, although he did not believe he could do it without her. Before their journey began, Kratos cut down all of the trees around their home that were marked with Faye's yellow handprint which had, unbeknownst to Kratos, sheltered them from the wrath of the Norse gods. This was for Atreus to venture into the dangerous land of the Norse gods with his father's support. Kratos wanted to be sure that his son was ready for the long adventure waiting for them, so he tested him in hunting a deer. With a few mistakes, Atreus did manage to prove himself, but they were intercepted by an aggressive troll. While the two survived the attack, Atreus would show his aggressive tendencies by continuing to stab the already dead troll, with Kratos determining him not to be ready. As they went back to their house, a stranger suddenly knocked on their door, demanding that Kratos show himself. The strange man would then demand him for answers\u00a0while taunting him of his past, something he did not anticipate. The argument would then spawn an aggressive fight, with the stranger showing unexpected great power. But Kratos would be the supposed victor when he snapped the man's neck after an exhausting battle. Knowing that the dangers of the outside world will inevitably come, Kratos changed his mind and he and Atreus began their journey.Path to the Mountain  During their trip to the highest mountain, they met a dwarf named Brok, who mentions that he and his brother are the forgers of the axe that Kratos possesses. The dwarf offers improvements to the axe as well as other weapons, armor, and equipment the two carry.  Atreus found tracks of a boar, deciding to hunt again. When he did wound the creature, the boy chased after it. Kratos and Atreus would then travel into another realm in the process, where they found the boar heavily injured and under the care of a mysterious woman. The woman, going by the Witch, brought them back to her home to heal the boar. While she sent Atreus to gather some supplies, she told Kratos in secret about his godly heritage, knowing that his son is unaware of his father's and his own true nature. And she warns the former god the danger he has put the two in as the Norse gods will be very hostile towards them as a result. The Witch proceeded to open a portal leading them to their destination, wishing them luck on the way out. As they made their way to the Lake of Nine, they found a rune saying, \"Sacrifice your arms to the centre of the water, awaken again the cradle of the world\". Kratos decided to the throw his Leviathan Axe to the lake as it said. While it initially did nothing, the lake would soon create heavy drifts and waves. There the two encountered J\u00f6rmungandr, the World Serpent. As the serpent begins to slumber again, Kratos and Atreus realize that its awakening had dropped the lake's water, bringing them closer towards more concise destinations. They find a large mechanism with a bridge attached to it named Tyr's Temple and decided to look around, also finding Brok again, who happens to set up shop in the massive area. Exploring once more, they meet Sindri, Brok's brother and owner of the other half of the two's brand, who was curious as to why Kratos is in possession of the Leviathan Axe as it was created specifically for Faye. Atreus explains how the mother had already passed away and decides to help the two in creating improvements to their armor and weaponry, like Brok. They travel closer to the peak of the mountain afterward, albeit while intercepting some enemies like an Ogre. Kratos and Atreus find themselves halted when there appears to be Black Breath blocking their way up the mountain. The Witch unexpectedly shows up in front of the two again, explaining how the only way to cast it away is by using the Light of Alfheim. She then takes them back to Tyr's Temple, commanding Kratos to have the contraption functioning again. There she takes them to the Realm Travel Room, the only place in all the nine realms one can use to travel between said realms. Using a Bifrost, they move the temple's bridge platform to the Alfheim gate, transporting them to Alfheim.The Light of Alfheim  As they arrive, the Witch for reasons unknown seems to have herself being pulled out of the realm, but not before telling Kratos to use the Bifrost to obtain the Light. Continuing on, Atreus notices how the realm is in constant warfare between the Dark Elves and the Light Elves. As the duo make their way across Alfheim the Dark Elves and their leader Svart\u00e1lj\u01ebfurr try to kill Kratos and Atreus they both fight their way through countless members of Dark Elves and they make it to the central chamber. After they arrive at the central chamber Kratos gives the axe to Atreus and he absorbs the Light of Alfheim into the Bifrost but while he's inside the light Kratos follows Faye's ashes and he listens to how Atreus resents him for not being a loving father and he arrives in J\u00f6tunheim and he's see's Faye and before he could reach her Kratos is then pulled out of the light by Atreus. Kratos then angrily scolds Atreus and he's then shocked about how long he's been in the light and Kratos the infuses the Talon Bow with Light of Alfheim and with the newfound power the duo kill the Dark Elve King and the light goes back to the Light Elves. While heading back to Tyr's Temple, Atreus angrily accuses Kratos of not loving Faye before Kratos and Atreus argue until they both reconcile.Inside the Mountain  After returning to Midgard the duo make their back to the mountain and the dispel the black breath and they enter the mountain and they defeat more creatures and they both bond more as father and son. Son after the duo make their way to the top of the mountain where they find out that Sindri was being attacked by Hr\u00e6zlyr, a dragon living in the mountain. Kratos kills the dragon with the help of Atreus and the grateful Sindri gives Atreus branded mistletoe arrows and he infuses Lighting into the Talon Bow and they use\u00a0the arrows to get to the top of the mountain. Kratos and Atreus overhear the mysterious man who attacked their house earlier is revealed to be the god Baldur along with two men who are talking to a man trapped in a tree. The trio leave and the duo learn that the man in the tree is Mimir and they soon discover that Faye's ashes were meant to be scattered in J\u00f6tunheim and Mimir tells Kratos to cut off his head with the duo then return to the Witches' woods and they both help her revive Mimir's head who reveals the witch to be Freya, ruler of Vanir gods and Odin's wife. Kratos gets angry with her for not telling him about her true identity and they leave without thanking her. Kratos and Atreus make their way back to the Lake of Nine when Mimir tells them to\u00a0go to the horn Kratos and Atreus encountered earlier, Kratos holds Mimir's head to the horn, blowing into it, calling the World Serpent, in which the serpent devours the statue of Thor next to the Muspelheim gate, Mimir speaks in the giants language to see if he recognizes him, of that he remembers, until he mistook Kratos and Atreus of being friends of Thor until Mimir assures him that they are no friends of Thor and had never spoken the giants tongue sober. After the conversation, the serpent realigns the bridge during which they need the Thamur's chisel. While on their way to Thamur's corpse, Mimir tells the story of Odin and Freya's marriage in order to bring peace between the Aesir and Vanir gods. After Odin's first love: the giantess Fj\u00f6rgyn and mother to Thor died, Odin felt heartbroken until Freya agreed to marry Odin not only because of her fertile beauty\u00a0but her expanded knowledge in Vanir magic, in which Odin felt intrigued in learning, something that Freya regretted when Odin's obsession with Jotunheim got in the way again as well as the story of Thamur. \u00a0 Kratos, Atreus, and Mimir make it to the dead Stone Masons body. But Mimir tells them that they will have to climb up to his hammer and smash the ice, as their weapons nor Thor's hammer can demolish it. Kratos and Atreus climb up to the hammer and detach the chains allowing the hammer to fall and smash the almost impenetrable ice. After defeating more enemies, the trio overhears voices of the demigods Modi and Magni. They're just about to retrieve part of his chisel when Magni appears who was battling an ogre, snapping his neck, until he notices the duo. Magni tells them to surrender, but Kratos refuses, to which Magni draws his weapon and prepare himself for battle. Kratos tells Atreus to flee as he will most likely get killed. But Modi appears and a fight ensues. The gods use the snow-blind to gain the advantage, during which Kratos asks of why do they hunt them and what does Odin want. Magni replies he doesn't know and he doesn't care, Modi decides to taunt Atreus mostly referring to his deceased mother in order for him to lose control of his actions. Despite the taunts, Atreus manages to stay calm with his father's words. While Magni distracts Kratos, Modi taunts the boy again this time causing the boy to lose control and charge wildly against the god. Kratos breaks his defense and kills Magni causing Modi to back away from Kratos in fear and cowardice. Atreus, still angered over the insults recklessly shoots arrows at him before showing early signs of sickness again.The Sickness  Kratos and Atreus journey back over to Tyr's Temple to retrieve the Black Rune and they're about to activate the sandbowl when Modi ambushes the duo pinning Kratos down under lightning. He says that he'll only earn his father's hammer cause Magni's dead and he said that he'll be a joke as he lived under his brother's shadow for most of his life. Atreus tells him to stop, only for Modi to spur another insult about Faye, causing the boy to charge at him, only for Modi to knock him aside and continue electrocuting his father. Atreus shrugs off the attack and says he doesn't know anything about his mother, Modi says that he'll be his new brother and will get to know him real soon, right after he finishes killing Kratos. This causes Atreus to activate his Spartan Rage for the first time, before collapsing. Upon seeing his son, Kratos struggles to get up and activate his Spartan Rage with a frightened Modi to walk back in terror. Kratos disarms Modi before knocking him into a wall with Modi running away in terror crying. Mimir suggests that Kratos takes Atreus back to Freya for help. As they enter the Witch's cave, an unknown person blows into the horn to call the World Serpent. At first, Freya refuses to help Kratos due to his resentment towards deities, but when Kratos tells her the situation, Freya changes her mind and lets them in. Freya tells Kratos that this is no ordinary illness because of his son's true nature lying within him. To cure then illness, Freya instructs Kratos to retrieve the Bridgekeeper's Heart in Helheim, but not after telling him that his Leviathan axe will be useless as the enemies there will be immune to frost as well as warning him that to never travel on the Bridge of the Dead as it is a one-way ticket into Helheim. Freya ensures Kratos that the boy is not his past, but his son\u00a0and that he needs his father and she gives him the travel rune to Helheim. Kratos rushes home via boat to retrieve his Blades of Chaos while being goaded and taunted by Athena about his past that he'll always and forever, will be, a monster. While Kratos is aware of this, he tells Athena that he is no longer her monster. Kratos journeys over to Tyr's temple to activate the travel room to Helheim where Mimir tells him that no one, not even the gods can survive the cold in Helheim, and notices that Helheim is too overpopulated as the worthy are supposed to go into Valhalla. Kratos eventually reaches the bridge where Mimir suggest he cause trouble as he is very good at it, he steps into the light where the troll notices him and the two have an intense fight with the troll gaining an upper hand when Kratos manages to kill the beast and retrieve his heart. Just as Kratos was about to leave, he encounters an illusion of Zeus. Mimir is surprised that Zeus was his father. Confused, Kratos asks Mimir on how he is here. Mimir reminds to never go beyond the bridge.  As Kratos journeys back to Midgard, Mimir pieces the relationship Kratos had with Athena, his fire blades, Zeus being his father, and the ash-white skin, he realizes he is hanging on the hip by none other than the Ghost of Sparta himself. Kratos coldly tells him to not call him that, with Mimir saying that the Greek pantheon had it coming to them. Mimir also tells Kratos to tell Atreus of his godly heritage, but Kratos refuses to do so, with Mimir stating that Atreus will eventually have to be told his true nature will be revealed soon, but Kratos drops the subject.The Truth  Back in Midgard, Kratos returns to Freya's stronghold where Freya too had a son, and that he disappeared many years ago and vows herself to learn from her past mistakes with Kratos concluding that he must know the truth. Atreus recovers successfully and continues on the\u00a0journey. As they are about to leave the grotto, Kratos notices Atreus acting quiet, and knows that he overheard his talk with Freya, he tells his father that he said he was cursed, he thought that he was weak because he wasn't like his father, and along the journey, everything was different for him. Kratos tells him he doesn't know everything, Atreus is aware of this, but knows the truth. Kratos instead tells him that he's a god from another land far away, when he came to Norway, he chose to live as a man, but the truth is that he was born a deity, as well as Atreus. Atreus asks his father if he can turn into an animal, but Kratos assures him that he can't as he does not know of his future god-like powers. Atreus is excited that he is a god and asks his father if Faye was a god as well. Kratos tells his son, that she was mortal, but was aware of his true nature. When the boy asks of why his father waited so long to tell him, Kratos comforts Atreus saying that he hoped to spare him, that being a god can be a lifetime of anguish and tragedy, which is the curse. Atreus, however, doesn't feel like a god, but in time, both father and son will learn. Atreus is still unsure if he could turn into a wolf, but Kratos is welcome to be surprised, Mimir adds that every god is unique such as a faculty for languages especially for one so young.  They return to Tyr's Temple and activate the sandbowl which lowers then down to Tyr's Vault. After getting past the first trap, Kratos and Atreus discover a room where they encounter many traps and relics Tyr has collected from many different lands, including Greece. Kratos notices a vase with leftover Lemnian wine from the Greek island of Lemnos, as well as a terracotta vase with him on it. Upon lowering the Black Rune, Kratos gets caught in a trap in which he tells Atreus to match the puzzles on the wall to match them, but this didn't stop at all as the floor started lifting them up to a ceiling of spikes, to which Atreus sacrifices his mother's knife to break the chain. As they are about to retrieve the Black Rune, Kratos gives Atreus a second knife, from which he told them that he crafted it with a mix of metals from his homeland and Norse metals and that the power of warrior comes from within, but only when tempered by emotions, as being a god has a greater responsibility. As they are leaving, Kratos gives Atreus a drink of the wine from the vase he took earlier before drinking some himself explaining the origins of the wine. Over time, Atreus starts to become arrogant and cocky after learning of his godhood which deeply concerns Kratos. Mimir asks Atreus if he's ready to see J\u00f6tunheim, Atreus adds that while he's excited, he's sad that the journey is almost over. Sindri quickly catches their attention. Kratos coldly tells Atreus not to tell him about their quest and that he's a god and that it's a personal quest, to which the dwarf adds that he knows a thing or two about family matters. Atreus, whines about the fact that Sindri talks about Brok all the time and how Brok is better than he is. So he tells Sindri to stop talking about it out of spite, leaving the dwarf hurt. When Kratos asks his son of the way he spoke to the dwarf, Atreus explains that he's fed up of all the talk about him and his brother. Kratos agrees, that while they are annoying, there was no need to make him an enemy and that it was unnecessary and unkind, to which Atreus scoffs at when he said that his mother wasn't a god when Kratos said that Faye would disagree, to which later, Atreus asks if he could carry his mothers ashes, to which Kratos refuses due to speaking ill of her, and reminding him that he will not dishonor her. After entering the mountain, they once again encounter Modi, who's been beaten mercilessly into a bloody pulp by his father, saying that his father blamed him for leaving Magni to die. Atreus, threatens him to back off, or he'll pick up where his father left off. modi tries to attack, but is too injured to do so, Atreus looks back at his father, in which he answers that Modi isn't worth killing due to his battered state. Atreus said that he should take back for all the insults Modi said about his mother. Kratos refuses to let him kill the god, but Atreus reminds him that they're gods and they can do whatever they want, in which Modi spurs one last insult about Faye, before being stabbed in the neck. Kratos tries to restrain him, but it falls on deaf ears, which Atreus says that his knife, is much better than his mother's, before kicking Modi down a ravine. Kratos reprimands him that his recklessness and arrogant nature will make him a target, reminding him that he taught him to kill, but only in defense of himself, never as an excuse. When Atreus asks what's the difference, Kratos tells him that there are consequences of killing gods. Atreus yells of how he knows such a thing, Kratos warns him to watch his attitude.Back in Helheim  After reaching the summit, Kratos activates the portal to J\u00f6tunheim with the newly acquired chisel and are about to enter when Baldur ambushes the duo with him gaining the upper hand. Kratos tells his son to cross the bridge, but Atreus ignores his father's orders and shoots Baldur several times before being knocked aside. Baldur explains that the boy\u00a0has the brains now with Kratos being a nuisance. Kratos manages to block Baldur's attack and knock him into the portal, causing it to collapse. Kratos tells his son to leave, with Baldur agreeing he'd do the same. Atreus charges at the god, but Kratos restrains him saying he's not ready, in which Atreus responds by shoving his father away and shooting him with one of his arrows. He charges at Baldur again\u00a0and stabs him in the shoulder, but Baldur, being invincible shrugs off the attack and drives the knife into Atreus before taking him with him. Kratos follows behind and lands on Baldur's dragon. After a brief scuffle, Baldur manages to knock Kratos off, with Kratos landing safely onto the temple bridge. Kratos runs towards the temple with Brok asking of who activated the bridge. Kratos catches up to Baldur, saying that the portal is locked into Asgard, and it'll be over for him when the entire weight of as Asgard will descend upon him. Kratos knocks Baldur aside and instead locks in Helheim. Kratos, Atreus, and Baldur fall into Helheim getting sucked in far that they fly over the Bridge of the Damned. Kratos angrily scolds his son and manages him to keep him in line again. They start their journey back to Midgard with Mimir saying that the boat is the only way back and will take them halfway back to the Temple bridge. As they journey back, they encounter Baldur once again, but this time, he encounters a flashback to when he first got his power of invulnerability. It's also revealed that his mother is none other than Freya herself. Freya cast a spell on him to prevent him from dying, however, this also made Baldur not feel anything, from food, temperature, women, etc. Baldur tearfully regrets not killing Freya and is left to mourn. Kratos and Atreus eventually make it to the boat where they set sail back to the temple bridge. But the boat gets stuck halfway across so Kratos finally lets Atreus help him get it unstuck. Mimir says that even though they will make it back to Midgard in one piece, he tells them that there's no other way to J\u00f6tunheim. As they get near the bridge, both father and son notice Zeus before they encounter a younger version of Kratos killing Zeus. Atreus tells him to focus as the boat is near the bridge and about to collapse because of the fires surrounding it had caused the boat to burn. After crash landing in the Realm Travel Room, they find the missing panel about Tyr traveling, to other lands including Greece. Mimir then realizes that there's another way to J\u00f6tunheim by making a key and the secret to unveiling the missing J\u00f6tunheim gate as Odin never gave up hope. On their way back to Midgard, Kratos asks Mimir of Baldur's vulnerability, Mimir says that there's none at all, as he's invulnerable to threats: physical or magical. All three realize that Mimir was bewitched, during the reanimating process, Freya bewitched Mimir so that he wouldn't tell the duo that mistletoe is the key to Baldur's invulnerability. After showing Brok the picture of making the key, he refuses to do so, as he tends to make weapons of war, not tools. Sindri shows up and the brothers reconcile and together, they make a\u00a0key for them. When Atreus asks\u00a0why the rune looks different, Sindri explains that it had to be reforged.Tyr's Secret and The Truth Revealed  Going down to the lower part of the temple, Kratos activates the door beneath the travel room where they find that the travel stone to J\u00f6tunheim is on the floor, but realize the room is upside down and could be flipped. After avoiding many traps and fighting enemies, they manage to break the chains holding the temple in place and Kratos was able to flip the temple\u00a0and manages to recover the travel stone. Mimir explains that Tyr used the travel rune to follow his own path, hence why he was able to travel to other lands, in the realm between realms. After making it into the void, the travel stone embeds the duo with protection as Kratos leaps into the void. After landing without any side effects, Atreus notices the missing J\u00f6tunheim tower was in the realm between realms all long. They enter the tower and insert the stone into a pedestal where it absorbs all the stone's energy. After fighting countless waves of enemies, Kratos opens the door and find themselves back in Midgard. With the tower restored, the duo plus Mimir lock J\u00f6tunheim in, but Mimir realizes that the travel crystal is missing. Mimir explains that they need his other eye to get to the realm. Without hesitation, they ask Brok and Sindri about it, but Sindri was unable to finish his part because of his germophobia, so Brok says that they stored Mimir's other eye in a vault in a statue of Thor that the Serpent ate. Kratos suggests the only way to retrieve it is by going inside the Serpent's belly. They make haste towards the horn where Mimir calls the serpent once again and asks if they could travel inside his stomach to retrieve his missing eye to which the serpent agrees. Kratos and Atreus row into the belly of the beast and manage to retrieve Mimir's other eye. As they leave,\u00a0however, a rumbling sound could be heard from the outside. Kratos and Atreus are thrown out of the serpent as the serpent falls back unconscious. While Atreus was wondering who hurt the serpent, Freya appears all of a sudden and says that she is looking for her son, saying that the woods and fields call his name. Kratos and Atreus become distant, as they find out that she is Baldur's mother after all. When Freya asks of why Atreus is standing so far from her, Baldur appears from the icy river and says that hurting the World Serpent would bring them out in the open. Baldur quickly notices his mother and Freya knows he's still angry and that how he feels hasn't changed. Baldur cuts her off mid-sentence saying that he doesn't need her to understand anything at all. Before Baldur could inflict damage on her, Kratos understands that even if he kills her, he will never find peace. Baldur says that he'll deal with him once he's done killing Freya, but Kratos pushes him back, which escalates into a fight with Freya trying to stop it by restraining both Kratos and Baldur. A few seconds into the fight, Freya restrains Kratos with Atreus attempting to free him. Baldur advises Atreus to step aside, but Atreus instead stands in front to protect his father, to which Baldur punches Atreus, only for the mistletoe arrow strapped to his quiver piercing his hand. Kratos, free from his bonds, tends to Atreus, to his surprise, is alright and not suffering any wounds. Baldur is astonished by the arrow\u00a0and starts to feel excitement upon the broken spell, before being restrained by Freya again, this time, in control of the reanimated corpse of Thamur. The corpse moves them to a new location. Atreus asks of how the mistletoe arrow broke the spell, Kratos adds that he can be killed.  Freya assures them that she can reason with him, but Kratos says that he means to kill her, to which Freya adds that she doesn't care and will protect him. A second fight ensures with the now vulnerable Baldur gleaming out to feel pain again. Midway through the fight, Kratos stuns Baldur, but Freya blocks their\u00a0path to him, but Kratos lifts the hand with ease and notices the crystal, and orders his son to shoot it at the exact timing, in which he does. As round three progresses, Freya summons cursed brood made from Vanir magic called legion to attack. As Kratos stuns Baldur, the reanimated giant, under the control of Freya, uses his chisel to separate the two, in which Baldur yells out he will kill her as he proceeds to climb the chisel with Kratos and Atreus hot on their trail. A short scuffle breaks out on top of the chisel\u00a0before Thamur tumbles them off onto his hand. In a stranglehold, Baldur tells them he wants to thank them for breaking the curse that has inflicted upon him and will rejoice soon. Kratos activates his Spartan Rage once again and breaks free with Atreus close behind. Another fight endures with Kratos and Atreus gaining the upper hand. Near the end of the fight, Kratos uses his Blades of Chaos to stun him before stunning him more with a series of close-by frontal attacks. Kratos beats Baldur relentlessly before Thamur uses his freeze breath in an attempt to freeze Kratos and Atreus. Atreus then calls the now conscious World Serpent, to separate Freya and Thamur. Kratos attempt to kill Baldur, but Atreus reminds him he is beaten. Kratos reminds Baldur in return to not come near them nor touch Freya again, in Freya says that she doesn't need protection and the two leave for mother and son to settle things out. Baldur explains that no matter where he goes or what he says, she will never stop interfering with his life. Freya explains that she was only trying to protect him. But Baldur says that she still needs to pay for the lifetime she stole from him. Freya explains that she has paid many times and if seeing herself dead will make things better, she lets Baldur strangle her. But Kratos interferes with Baldur saying that he could have walked away, in which Kratos quotes Zeus and explains that they must be better than this, before snapping his neck killing him at last. Freya is devastated upon seeing her son's lifeless body\u00a0and threatens Kratos to use all of her power to curse him. Atreus explains that he saved her life. But Freya is unfazed and calls Kratos an animal by passing his cruelty and rage, that he will never change. Kratos says that she does not know him well enough. Freya adds that she does, but does Atreus? Kratos tells Atreus to listen close\u00a0and informs him that he is from Sparta and how he made an oath to a god that cost him his soul. He killed many who were deserving and many who were not, and adds that he killed his father. Atreus is shocked upon learning that was his father killing his grandfather and asks of how this always ends, with children killing their parents since their gods. But Kratos assures him that they must strive to do better and not repeat the same mistakes as their predecessors. Freya leaves in silence afterward. Mimir asks if they're the bad guys now, Kratos says that might be true, but she could never make that choice. Atreus asks why Freya threatened his father even though she loathed the Aesir, Mimir states that they killed her son and that the death of a child is something that a parent cannot get over. But he assures him that Freya will get over her son's death over time and that Kratos did the right thing. They start the journey back to Tyr's Temple where Mimir explains Hrimthur's story, he adopted the guise of a mortal and promised the Aesir that if he can finish building the wall around Asgard within two years and finished it, he would meet with Freya, and if not, they will owe him nothing. Odin was suspicious of the stranger\u00a0but agreed to do as he asked. Using his father's knowledge of stone masonry, Hrimthur finished the wall, much to Odin's frustration. He met with Freya and whispered something in her ear, and as he was about to leave Asgard, Thor was waiting for him. The giant realizes he'd been double-crossed, but he did not care, as his plan was complete. Mimir suspects that Hrimthur added a weak spot in Asgard's walls and passed this knowledge to Freya.Jotunheim at last  After arriving at the Realm Travel Room, Kratos locks in J\u00f6tunheim and orders Atreus by giving him Mimir's head and positioning it into the beam and straight onto the door finally unlocking J\u00f6tunheim. Before Kratos and Atreus can finish their journey, Mimir says that they should leave him here, as he doesn't want a decomposing head ruining the father-son moment. Before Kratos could say anything, Brok and Sindri show up impressed and how they wanted to see this, Mimir at first refused, but knowing there would be no other way, he allowed the dwarfs to watch him. Kratos passes the head to Sindri, who passed to his brother and father and son make their way into the realm, with Mimir telling them to hurry back. Kratos and Atreus finally reach the giant's fingers, with Kratos unraveling his bandages saying that he has no more to hide. Kratos finally gives Atreus the bag of his mothers ashes. They make their way into a vast room where they encounter statues of giants, possibly the few remaining giants escaping Midgard. As they are leaving the room, Atreus touches the wall which crumbles around them and seeing a mural depiction of his mother with a bunch of giants, their meeting with the World Serpent for the first time, as well as the dragon in the mountain, the stonemason, and their fight with Baldur. Atreus realizes that the giants prophesied their journey. Kratos tells him that their journey is his story and that he's not the only parent with secrets making Atreus realize that he's a giant too. When Atreus asks why she didn't tell him, Kratos explains that she sent them here knowing she would find this and that she would've had good reasons. Kratos deduces that Baldur was never sent to find him, and he was tracking Faye all along, not knowing she was only ashes. Atreus, with a full set of confidence, says she hasn't been wrong yet and so close to the end, with Kratos looking at a plaque of Atreus holding a dead body screaming in agony. (most likely depicting his death, though this is yet to be true as there are inconsistencies with this body and Kratos.) Kratos and Atreus reach the top, noticing all the dead giants. Atreus hands over the bag full of ashes to his father, but Kratos says that they will do it together and calls him son. After spreading her ashes, Atreus realizes that the giants are all gone and his name on the wall, the giant's called him Loki. Kratos found out that was the name Faye wanted to call him when he was born. When Atreus asks why\u00a0Kratos says they will find out some other day. As the two leave, Atreus asks of why he wanted to be called that name. Kratos tells him he was named after a compassionate spartan soldier who filled the lives of everyone with joy and happiness. Atreus is impressed and tells him he actually told a good story and that Mimir missed it. As they near the travel room, Atreus understand that they should go home, but they could prove themselves useful by exploring some more and defeating corrupted Valkyries. As they enter the room, Mimir is glad to see them and adds that he reached his limit for dwarven charm. As they are heading back to Midgard, Mimir warns them that Fimbulwinter-the great winter that precedes Ragnarok is upon them as it was not supposed to happen for a couple hundred years and that Kratos may have accelerated the events. As they arrive home, Atreus says that he will sleep through winter. Kratos tells him to get some rest, with Atreus adding that he is way ahead of them, in which Atreus has a vision of Thor showing up at their house when Fimbulwinter ends. When they wake up, Atreus felt like this was real, at first Kratos isn't disturbed by this, but when Atreus reminds him again, he assures his son that they will worry about it tomorrow.Powers and Abilities  As a demigod, Kratos possesses incredible superhuman physical prowess, beyond that of any mortal or beast and surpassing all other Greek Gods, the exact limits of which are yet to be determined. It is presumed Kratos was born with his god-like abilities due to being Zeus' demigod son. He might also be partially immortal and may have gotten stronger when he absorbed powers from the Gods. Due to these abilities, Kratos was able to defeat monsters, magical beings, Titans and even the Gods themselves. His old age does not hamper his physical capabilities, as he has displayed the ability to outmatch the most physically powerful of the Norse Gods, such as Baldur and Magni. When using the Spartan Rage, he was able to easily scare off Modi. Apparently, he is one of the few in the Norse realm\u00a0who has the physical power to potentially rival the likes of Thor and Odin. It is worth noting that Odin is greatly afraid of him as he knows that Kratos will be involved in Ragnarok. Kratos possesses incredible superhuman strength, which seems to fluctuate depending on the situation. He can easily subdue and rip apart many large and powerful beasts and creatures such as Undead Legionnaires, infected humans, monsters, and magical beings in half, using only his bare hands and can easily rip off Helios' head. and is capable of overpowering the Hydra, throwing the Colossus of Rhodes after it attempted to crush him beneath its foot, and preventing both Cronos and Atlas from crushing him. In his battle against Hercules, who is considered to be unrivaled in terms of sheer strength, Kratos proved capable of stopping his charges, forcing him backward\u00a0and enduring his powerful bear hugs without any ill effects, even breaking free from them and defeating him. He has always physically overpowered all other Norse Gods he fought. His strength remains unaffected by his age, as despite being now elderly in the Nordic realm, Kratos was able to easily snap the neck of a troll with his bare hands, lift, throw and even smash massive boulders, and physically equal and eventually overpower among the strongest of the Norse Gods such as Baldur, one of the sons of Odin and Magni, the strongest of the children of Thor. His spartan rage increases his strength to the point where he can create earthquakes with a single stomp. In addition to his vast physical strength, Kratos also possesses great levels of superhuman agility, stamina, durability, endurance, reflexes, and speed. Feats of durability include falling from great heights and walking away unharmed, getting crushed, stabbed, beaten, blasted, and burned by various enemies and traps as well as survive extreme environments such as Hel, the Norse Realm of the Dead, which according to Mimir was said to be so cold that not even Odin himself can survive there for long, as well as Muspelheim. Kratos's speed allows him to keep up with opponents who possess vast speed, such as Zeus who has the speed of lightning, Charon, Hermes, and Pollux and Castor who possessed Chronokinesis. He is also able to regenerate from most wounds at a fast rate, though he did not regenerate from the scar on his stomach caused by the Blade of Olympus and the scar over his right eye caused by Ares for reasons unknown (maybe he cannot fully regenerate himself from scars caused by gods' power). Kratos also possesses powerful resistance to most forms of attack and magic (ex: time manipulation, illusion, and soul manipulation) that would easily kill most humans or magical beings. When Kratos loses in battle or war and is killed, he simply escapes the Underworld to Earth. Kratos can change his fate by manipulating or traveling in time. Kratos also has absorbed the power of Hope, allowing him to kill the immortal Olympians. After Kratos killed Ares, Athena made him the new God of War, giving him the powers of a God. Kratos could grow 500 or more feet tall, as well as become a fiery comet which would lay waste to all below him, and possessed all powers of a God of War. It is possible he had acquired a permanent level of power and ability beyond even that of demigod from his constant trials and contact with different powers and magic. Kratos, before and after becoming a God, gained many powers and weapons from the Gods.\u00a0When he relinquished his old powers to the Blade of Olympus, he was given new powers by the Titans. Some of these powers resemble the abilities given to him by the Gods. The Blade of Olympus is one of Kratos' greatest weapons, as he has infused all of his godly power into it. Although often defined by his brute strength, he also has a wisdom almost matching the goddess Athena as he is quite cunning and knowledgeable having managed to solve many puzzles throughout his journey, many of them created by famous architects like Archimedes, Daedalus or Pathos Verdes III, and even some Nordic puzzles as such he not only survived all the traps and creatures within but he also become the only one to break those challenges. He also managed to solve the Olympus' Garden puzzle which even Hera had not believed he could. Interestingly enough, Kratos, when he had a godly power that can make him into a giant, such as when he fought in Rhodes, and similar to his empowerment against Ares, he seemed to prefer to use his normal mortal size to battle many powerful creatures and gods. Kratos also was wise enough to use the environment against his enemies, like using the bridge mechanic to kill a Kraken or using Gaia's heart to restore his health. The most notable event that proves his wisdom is when he manages to break out of Aegaeon the Hekantonkheires prison by using Megaera's anger toward him. He even got the upper hand on Zeus during their second encounter by feigning defeat and causing Zeus to lower his guard enough for Kratos to effectively and immediately strike him and nearly kill him. Kratos also has useful skills that include climbing mountains and building, jumping great heights, and swinging on ropes to cross long gaps. He is capable of sensing danger and possesses great skills and accuracy with all forms of weapon and powerful magic as well as hand-to-hand combat, making him an extremely formidable fighter coupled with his colossal physical prowess.Weapons  Before serving Ares, Kratos' main weapon was his sword. Under Ares' rule, Kratos' main weapons became the Blades of Chaos, a gift from Ares as a sign of his servitude. They are essentially two Falchion-like blades on long chains, permanently fused and seared to the wielder's forearms. Once Kratos killed Ares, Athena replaced them with a nearly identical pair of blades called the Blades of Athena, and then replaces them again in God of War III with the very similar Blades of Exile. Kratos displays proficiency with all of his weapons. It is implied that he learned many of his fighting skills from Ares and other gods, the former God of War himself. Initially, Kratos also had a massive Spartan army under his command, used both before and during his servitude under Ares. When he finds himself in the Nordic Realm, Kratos seems to have lost all the weapons he obtained from his quest of vengeance, having been destroyed by Zeus back when he was fighting him. But the Blades of Chaos are shown to still be in his possession, but decides to hide them under his cabin. This probably acts as a way for him to move on while still reminding himself of the atrocities he committed. He initially wields a magic axe known as the Leviathan which he found in the woods where he met Faye, the mother of his future son, Atreus. The axe has the properties of ice magic as swinging its blade creates light blue energy waves, which can be charged up, and hitting the ground freezes enemies close to impact. Kratos also throws the axe directly towards opponents in battle and it seems that it can return to his hand by raising it but only for a limited range. While the Blades of Chaos, whom he unearthed to fight the forces in Helheim, possessed the properties of fire, which can also burn enemies in a certain heavy combo attack, the Leviathan's ice magic is very effective against enemies with the attribute of Burn, while the fiery swing of the Blades damage effectively those of Frost. After meeting with Brok and Sindri, gem slots called Runic Attacks are given on each weapon's head that modifies the axe's and the blades' abilities. Kratos also wields the Guardian Shield, a golden circular shield attached to a golden gauntlet in his arm that he uses both offensively and defensively. He wears it like a brace for his left forearm but it instantly retracts to its full form at will. He is shown to pair this with his axe or his left Blade of Chaos in battle. He can infuse the magical abilities of his axe and the fire of his left Blade of Chaos into the shield, allowing for more explosive and devastating combos. And he is able to parry with the shield, managing to deflect enemy projectiles back at them.Appearance  Kratos is the epitome of what a Spartan soldier is in that he is essentially made for battle. He is exceptionally tall, standing at a height between 6 and 7 feet, in which, due to his status a warrior, he is at his peak physical condition. Based on his facial features and voice patterns, one can assume Kratos' age is ranging from the late 30s to early 40s of the first games. Prior to the series' actual time of taking place he had tanned skin and a red tattoo going down the majority of his upper body and up to his face. On his face, besides the aforementioned tattoo, he has a scar on his right eye and a black goatee. The scar was caused by Ares when Kratos was a child and tried to save his brother from the raid of Gods on Sparta. After killing his beloved wife and child, two of the few people he truly cared for, the village oracle bound their ashes to his skin to be forever a reminder of the horrible deed he committed on that day. As a Spartan General prior to his service to Ares, Kratos wore Spartan hoplite armor and after becoming the new God of War he wore a very elaborately decorated piece of armor. By the end of God of War III, Kratos only wears a leather loincloth and armlets without the chains of the Blades of Exile. As of God of War (2018), Kratos' appearance changes slightly. He appears older, with more wrinkles on his face looking to be in his mid to late 50s or 60s. His goatee has grown into a bushy, full beard which covers half his face and has several gray hairs. His skin is still pale and covered with the ashes of his Spartan family, and his tattoos have faded slightly. He retains the scar on his abdomen, however, it is larger and less jagged than before due to him stabbing himself at the end of God of War III. Also from the same wound, he now has a long scar covering almost all of his back. Also present are faded scars from where the chains from the blades were attached to his forearms, which he prefers to keep covered beneath with what appears to be fur-lined leather, secured with thongs of leather.Kratos' Affixed Ashes  As Kratos attacked a village which worshiped the goddess Athena at the behest of his lord at the time, Ares, the Oracle who resided in the village warned the Spartan to not enter the Temple of Athena. Kratos, however, disregarded her warnings and slaughtered the people in the temple. After the massacre, Kratos had realized that he had not only murdered all in the temple, but he had unintentionally murdered his wife and child. As Kratos mournfully cradled the unmoving body of his dead wife, he discovered that Ares had orchestrated his family's death. After leaving the burning temple, the Oracle placed a spell on Kratos, a spell which caused the ashes of his wife and child to be forever affixed to his skin. As in God of War (2018), He keeps this appearance to his later life in Midgard, although some parts of his skin have pinked in color for some reason. Only in God of War: Chains of Olympus is Kratos seen without the ashes, not including flashbacks and bonus costumes.Personality  Throughout most of the series (particularly the later entries preceding his journey to Norway), Kratos is incredibly cruel, reckless, and destructive, willing to kill anyone who gets in his way, even innocent people. He is also shown to be incapable of accepting full responsibility for his actions, usually blaming the gods (especially Zeus, Ares, and Athena) for his suffering while ignoring or denying his own part in it. The memory of his misdeeds has driven Kratos to attempt suicide on at least two separate occasions. Earlier on in the series canon, he is less callous towards the lives of others, albeit perfectly willing to sacrifice an innocent bystander when it is required of him. He also exhibits a deep sense of shame and horror at his reputation as the Ghost of Sparta. One example is when Kratos tries to convince a woman in Athens to give him a key, only for her to run away in terror and call him a monster; Kratos is visibly aghast by the fear and hatred others have for him. This shame was further demonstrated when he observed the massacres committed by Ares' minions, causing him to question what he had become. In God of War: Ascension, his earliest canonical appearance, he genuinely mourns the death of Orkos and the Delphic Oracle, even giving Orkos a decent funeral pyre. In Delphi, when Castor orders the guards to remove Kratos from the Oracle's temple, Kratos spares them when they have the good sense to flee. On the island of Delos, he is merciful enough to push an innocent man out of the way of an incoming spear, whereas he would have most likely just let him die in later games. It is possible that Kratos had yet to develop the apathy for others' lives that would come with his later experiences, but this is not proven. He is also very libidinous and sexually passionate with many women, although as stated by Gaia, he never found true happiness or comfort in these acts, with Lysandra being the only woman he ever loved. Before and during the original God of War, Kratos was also respectful towards gods and divine entities (with the exception of Ares, whom he also called \"Lord\" up until his betrayal and Persephone), to the point of calling them \"Lords\", although he did not fully trust them. As time went on, he became disillusioned with the gods and began to respect them less and less. At the end of his service to the gods of Olympus, when it became clear that they would never relieve him of his nightmares, he became openly defiant and hostile towards them, even after being made a god himself, his hatred however reached it\u2019s peak after learning of their role in his mother\u2019s and brother's suffering after which he swore vengeance upon them .He was also respectful towards Gaia due to her helping him in his quest, although he was skeptical as to why she was doing so. Following her betrayal, Kratos lost all respect for divine beings, and began ruthlessly murdering god and titan alike. However, he is shown to care for Athena to some degree (and vice versa), with Kratos being more affected by her death than even Zeus, who seemed to care very little (if at all) about her death. He is also tolerant of Aphrodite and Hephaestus since they are both indifferent (and in the latter's case, even somewhat supportive) to his war on Olympus. It is likely that he felt a certain level of kinship with Hephaestus, as they share a mutual hatred of Zeus as well as intense pain over their lost daughters, although he is eventually forced to kill the Smith God when he tries to prevent him from reaching his daughter, Pandora. In spite of this, Kratos respected Hephaestus' desire to protect Pandora as he told her that her father died doing what any father should do: protecting the life of his child and even tried to stop Pandora from killing herself even requiring her convincing to allow her to sacrifice herself. By the time of God of War III, Kratos is so blinded by rage and obsessed with killing Zeus that he does not notice, or care, that he is destroying the entire Greece in his quest for revenge, coldly ignoring the warnings of Athena, Poseidon, Hera, and Zeus himself that his murdering of the gods would bring about the end of life on the Grecian world. He does, however, express extreme guilt for what he has done to Greece after killing Zeus, ultimately attempting suicide over it. In spite of his cruel acts, Kratos is shown to care deeply for his wife and daughter, with the memories of their deaths driving him to the point of madness. In fact, the one and only time Kratos is shown to be happy is when he briefly reunites with his daughter, Calliope, in Chains of Olympus. He also cared for his younger brother Deimos and his mother Callisto, with their deaths further contributing to his growing hatred for the Gods of Olympus. In addition, Kratos respected his fellow Spartans, including the Last Spartan\u00a0who he encountered several times during God of War: Ghost of Sparta and God of War II. When he learned of Sparta's destruction at Zeus' hand, Kratos was devastated and angrily demanded that Zeus come down and face him. During his battle with Zeus at the end of God of War II, he declared that he would not let him destroy Sparta, demonstrating that he cared for Sparta and its people. In God of War III, Kratos grows attached to Pandora as she reminds him of his own daughter, even mistaking her for Calliope upon their first encounter, despite the fact that she's only an \"object\". He became filled with rage after Hera insulted Pandora, and responded by killing her. Kratos ultimately tried to stop Pandora from sacrificing herself, although he was unsuccessful. When Kratos encountered his half-siblings or cousins, he merely ignored them or told them to step aside, indicating that he does not harbor any particular hatred for them, but will kill them if necessary. This was shown in his confrontations with Theseus and Hercules. Despite his war on Olympus, Kratos (at least initially) only truly desired the death of Zeus, and possibly Poseidon and Hades as well. For example, Kratos was legitimately interested, though understandably suspicious, when Helios offered to help Kratos as a way of repaying his debt, implying that Kratos would have spared him if not for his treachery. He also tries to ignore Hermes at first, viewing him as more of a pest than a serious threat, and only attacks him after incessant provocation.In God of War (2018)  After destroying Olympus, remarrying, and siring another child, Atreus, in Norway, Kratos becomes a more stoic character, only bursting out in anger when antagonized or threatened. Although he is sometimes prone to outbursts when disciplining his son, he almost always manages to regain control of himself before doing any damage. He also accepts full responsibility for his actions in Greece, often exhibiting extreme sadness and regret, and at times even falling into a state of depression, when confronted about his past behavior, he now also dreads being called the \"Ghost of Sparta\", angrily telling Mimir not to call him that. He is also more considerate to others' feelings as well, as he sternly reproaches Atreus when the latter asking Sindri the reason of Brok's blue skin while he himself doesn't. As a result of his drastic maturity, Kratos is shameful of his past and prefers to keep it a secret from his son. However, he eventually realizes being open to Atreus with his mistakes would allow Atreus to learn from Kratos' mistakes and not go down the dark path he himself once trodden. Following his union with Faye, Kratos went to great lengths to cover up his past as a God, especially from Atreus. Believing that his son\u2019s godhood was a curse, Kratos kept the truth hidden with hopes that Atreus would live a normal life, though his secrecy became the source of his son\u2019s recurring illness. Unfortunately for Kratos, Atreus despite his compassionate nature appears to have inherited his father's impulsiveness and tendency towards rage. He is alarmed at Atreus' outbursts and is quick to reprimand him for it, fearing that he will become the same monster as Zeus was in Greece. He is shown to love Atreus just as he loved Calliope, Lysandra, and most likely Faye. Telling his son that they would complete the journey together. Kratos's relationship with Faye is not well-known but it is apparent that they had a very close and loving relationship, as Kratos openly acknowledges that Faye was better than a God and wondered if he could raise his son without her. He also respected Faye's wishes of not taking Atreus hunting, resulting in Kratos being gone most of the time hunting for the family. However, his distrust for divine beings remains intact, opting to avoid interaction with the Norse Gods whenever possible, even when they (like Freya) try to befriend and help him. He is also shown to still harbor resentment towards the gods of Olympus, promptly telling the spirit of Athena to leave his head the moment she appears. He likewise reassures her that, while he is still a monster, he is no longer her monster. Despite this, Kratos is shown to have become more reasonable in dealing with the Norse Gods, as he was able to come to trust and care for Freya after she saved his son despite all of his previous distrust. Even after learning Freya had bewitched Mimir to prevent them from learning Baldur's weakness, Kratos cared enough to fight Baldur for her and later saved her life by killing Baldur when he attempted to choke her to death. He did not harm her when she swore vengeance on him, likely as he understands the pain she feels, having felt the same after killing his family, and believes that time will eventually cause her to forgive him. He also came to develop a strong friendship with Mimir, eventually taking his advice\u00a0more and even comforting him at times. Kratos now only kills out of self-defense and does not see the point in killing a weakened enemy. He even tries to be the voice of reason when Atreus finds out he is a god and lets it go to his head. Though he does not exactly like being around Brok and Sindri, Kratos is never rude or ill-natured around them and even allows them to work on his weaponry and gear, he was even shocked when Atreus asked why Brok is blue and when he badmouths Sindri, showing that he is at least sensitive enough to know when to not make an enemy. He was even willing to spare a weakened Modi and was greatly shocked and angered when Atreus, who learned of his godhood and became much more arrogant killed him. Likewise, for Baldur, Kratos offered him multiple chances to step aside and only fought him when threatened. He ultimately offered Baldur a chance to escape when he was defeated and even tried reasoning with him saying that vengeance is not a path to be walked by as people would not find peace, recounting his own experience with it. Due to his slaying of the Gods of Olympus, Kratos now understands that vengeance will not bring him or others peace, even trying to talk Baldur out of killing Freya and then killing him when he attempts to do so to try and end the cycle of children killing their parents. When Freya threatens Kratos and swears vengeance against him, he does not retaliate in anger and simply replies that she does not know him, showing maturity and self-control. When Atreus accused Kratos of not caring for Faye, he was simply annoyed and told Atreus to stop talking. Although Kratos does not seem to enjoy troubling himself by helping dead spirits, mainly because they no longer have any \"needs, only wants\", he does help people when need be. When prompted by Mimir to rescue the valkyries, Kratos complained, but submitted to the task. When they reached J\u00f6tunheim, Mimir wanted to stay behind because their business was between Atreus and Kratos, but Kratos objected at first because he didn't want any affliates of Odin finding Mimir. At the beginning of his journey with Atreus, Kratos kept his forearms wrapped in bandages to hide the scars from his chained blades, symbolizing his desire to hide his past from his son. At the end of their journey, after coming clean to his son about his past, Kratos threw away his bandages, deciding he has nothing left to hide from his son. Kratos has also developed a dry sense of humor such as when Mimir asked Atreus to carry him since Kratos was tackling deadly traps, Kratos replied he would not want Mimir to miss \"this\" (the excitement of dodging the traps) and smirk slightly when Mimir claimed Kratos was enjoying himself.Trivia In Greek Mythology In General In Greek Era In Nordic Era Guest Appearances Other Media External links God of War III  God of War III is the fifth installment in the popular God of War series, released on March 16, 2010 for the PlayStation 3, and a remastered version on July 14, 2015 for the PlayStation 4. It is the seventh chapter in the series chronologically, after God of War: Ascension, God of War: Chains of Olympus, God of War, God of War: Ghost of Sparta, God of War: Betrayal and God of War II.Story  Following the ending of God of War II, God of War III picks up directly after this with a stirring opening narration from Zeus discussing the actions of the rogue Kratos, who is 'commanding' a small army of Titans rescued from the Great War (using the power of the Fates). The Olympians immediately rush to battle; Helios rides on his chariot over Olympus, Hermes speeds down the very peaks of Olympus as Zeus watches on, Hercules receives the order to lead his troops down into the fray, Hades lunges off and engages several Titans in his giant form, and Poseidon (using his aquakinesis) shoots down from Olympus like a missile and performs a death blow through the chest of Epimetheus, and then manifests himself as a massive water being and spawns several water horses called Hippocampi to aid in the battle. With Poseidon as their greatest threat in the battle, having already decimated numerous Titans and soon going after Gaia herself, Kratos engages the God of the Sea and after drawing him into Gaia's grasp manages to knock a weakened Poseidon out of his godly form and onto a separate platform. The two\u00a0quarrel with\u00a0each other briefly before Kratos walks up and beats the Lord of the Sea savagely, finally gouging out his eyes and snapping his neck\u00a0before he tosses him into the ocean. With Poseidon's death, the seas cataclysm and ocean levels rise significantly, causing a flood that appears to engulf the entire world and destroying almost all of mankind save those on top of Olympia. After killing Poseidon, Gaia and Kratos reach Zeus' pavilion, where the king of the gods angrily anticipates Kratos' arrival and, at last, assaults them with a mighty blast of lightning that blows off a massive amount of Gaia's arm and sends the two spiraling down Olympus (Kratos survives presumably by using the Golden Fleece to absorb most of the blast). However, even using the Blade of Olympus to stab into her back, Kratos is unable to hang on as Gaia fights to survive and climb back up to Zeus. She warns him that he was only a pawn and is now expendable now that the Titans have reached Zeus, allowing the embittered Spartan to tumble to his death. Kratos contemplates his life as he lurches through the River Styx and its caverns, and resolves to escape Hades (once again) and destroy Zeus. On his way to Hades' chamber after being sucked of nearly all of his power from the dead souls of Styx, he reunites with a newly-formed Athena who claims to have reached a \"new level of existence\" and is willing to help Kratos assume his revenge, granting him new weapons to survive the Underworld and the foes that lie ahead, and also defining his next quest of finding and extinguishing the Flame of Olympus in order to truly defeat Zeus. Kratos makes his way through the Underworld meeting a couple of lost souls, encountering statues of the judges of the Underworld, meeting Hephaestus who informs him more and more about the secrets of Olympus and Zeus, and finding mysterious scrawls on the ground that he silently acknowledges to be from various people in his past. Finally entering Hades' palace he finds the coffin-wed body of Persephone that Hades had restored, and engages the Lord of the Underworld himself inside of a dark cavern. Hades matches Kratos until the bloodthirsty Spartan manages to rip off his helmet and steal his weapons, and then ripping out Hades' own soul and absorbs it using the Claws of Hades. Escaping the Underworld through a Hyperion Gate, Kratos renews his journey up along Olympus except that he now faces both the Titans and the Gods - he encounters Helios on his chariot where later he rips the sun god's head off with his bare hands and receives the Head of Helios, he 'amputates' the legs of Hermes acquiring the Boots of Hermes, mercilessly beats his own half-brother Hercules to death with the Nemean Cestus, breaks Hera's neck after she insults Pandora, a small childlike creation of Hephaestus who is the key to extinguishing the Flame of Olympus and revealing its contents, encountering a radiant Aphrodite and her handmaidens in the goddess' chamber, stabbing the Titan Cronos in the head with the Blades of Olympus at Tartarus, impaling Hephaestus after betraying Kratos to Cronos, receiving the Nemesis Whip from Hephaestus just before his death, battles Skorpius, The Queen of the Scorpions and finally arriving at the Flame's chamber with Pandora, only to be interrupted by Zeus himself. Zeus prevents Pandora from her destiny and engages Kratos, though the latter bests the King of the Gods in a duel and suddenly has a change of heart. Pandora was made to be the Key to Pandora's Box, which is what truly rests within the Flame of Olympus, and would have to sacrifice herself. However, due to inadvertent prodding from Zeus pleads that Kratos not \"fail in his decisions this time\", Kratos releases Pandora and attacks Zeus in extreme rage, only to be stunned by the Flame's dissipation. Kratos opens the Box once again, just as he had in the first game, only to discover that it is empty. Zeus mocks him for \"another failure\", and teleports outside in order to recover, while Kratos' rage grows even stronger. Father and son meet outside once again on a familiar platform, but before either can claim victory, the platform is suddenly shaken by a reawakened Gaia (believed to have been killed during the fight and subject of many Titans anger against Kratos), who violently shakes them and causes them to flee inside of her body. Inside of her chest, Kratos and Zeus duel near her heart; Zeus sucks her heart of her life and rejuvenates as does Kratos, and finally, Gaia is killed when Kratos impales Zeus against her heart, which apparently also killed Zeus. Awakening amidst cracked earth, Kratos finds Zeus' body impaled on a rock, and extracts the blade callously. However, when Kratos tries to leave, Zeus' still active spirit, consumed by some lasting hatred for his 'infidel' son, attacks and apparently drains Kratos of his willpower, his anger, and instead fills him with fear and a sense of loss whilst throwing him on the verge of death. Before dying, Kratos shares a last-minute mental journey with the guide of Pandora, whose spirit lives on within him, and begins abolishing the various things that torment his soul - the very things that the Astral Zeus is using to kill his mind, similar to what Ares once did. Overcoming these hurtles with a feeling of Hope, Kratos regains conscious and forces Zeus' spirit back into his body, before beating Zeus to death with his bare hands, ending the reign of the Olympians once and for all as it seems... Athena arrives to congratulate Kratos on his victory and requests that he turn over the power he claimed from Pandora's Box, but he reveals that there was nothing inside. Athena claims he is lying, because when the evils of the Titanomachy were first sealed into the box, as a safety measure, she placed into the box the \"most powerful weapon in the world\", hope, to counter act the evils. She demands Kratos return this power he obtained from the box that rightfully belongs to her, for now that the world is cleansed by chaos, she will rebuild it under her rule with the power of hope. Athena realizes, however, that when Kratos first opened the box to kill Ares, as the evils infected and took hold of the gods of Olympus, especially Zeus, the power of hope infused itself into Kratos. Hope had been buried deep beneath the anger, need for vengeance, and guilt, and when Kratos had finally learned to forgive himself for his past, he had released the power. Athena again demands Kratos give her the power, but Kratos refuses, and impales himself on the Blade of Olympus. Which then, a large ray of blue light releases itself into the sky, giving all mankind the power of Hope. Athena becomes furious, claiming that man will not know what to do with Hope. She removes the sword from Kratos, and departs, telling Kratos how disappointed she is by his actions. He snarls he owes her nothing (a callback to the beginning of the second game). In the post-credits scene, the spot where Kratos' body was lying is now empty, with a trail of blood going off the edge of the cliff. This scene is reminiscent of his suicide attempt in God of War. However, it seems he traveled to another world in God of War (2018).David Jaffe's Cut Plot  In an interview with GameTrailers.com, David Jaffe explained his story to God of War III. The first cutscene featured Oceanus in his water form (similar to Poseidon's God form) killing Hermes. Kratos then would fight Zeus in the opening boss fight and kill him. Then a portal opens on Mt. Olympus where the Egyptian and Norse Gods descend from. The Titans and the Greek, Egyptian, and Norse Gods wage a war to determine who would ultimately rule the world. Kratos then discovers the power to teleport back and forth through Norway, Egypt, and Greece. Kratos encounters Stheno and takes her head in a boss fight. Then in another boss fight with the Sphinx, Kratos uses Stheno's head to turn the beast into stone (and that's how we have the Sphinx statue today in Egypt). Kratos then realizes the way to permanently kill a God is to get mortals to stop believing in them. Kratos' plan was already in effect because the Gods were focused on ruling the world and had their minds off of the mortals. Thus, the mortal world was under natural disasters. The mortals stopped believing in the Gods, which weakened them. Kratos & the Titans kill off the remaining Gods. Kratos then uses the Blades of Athena to slit his wrists, resulting in another trip to the Underworld where he is reunited with his wife & daughter. The final cutscene showed the Three Wise Men heading to the North Star resulting with the birth of Christianity. Bit of War, a God of War III demake, follows David Jaffe's version of the plot loosely.Items and abilities Weapons Magic Items Relics Godly Possessions  The Godly Possessions are magical items that once belonged to the gods can now be found hidden in several places in the game. Once found they can be used at any time during your second play through. They can be very helpful, but once you activate a Godly Possession you will not be able to receive any Trophies for the entire play through.Enemies Common Enemies Bosses Characters Sequel  When asked about a possible sequel, director Stig Asmussen revealed this, in a March 2010 article on 1UP: When asked if he felt the same way about portable entries or other forms the series could take beyond PlayStation home console releases, he said, However, despite this, a full gameplay trailer for a fourth game was revealed at E3 2016. God of War (2018) was released on April 20th, 2018, as a Playstation 4 exclusive.Cast Critical Reception  God of War III has received critical and universal acclaim. In the February 16, 2010 edition of the Official PlayStation Magazine UK, the first review score was given as 9/10. Reviewer Nathan Ditum says \"the game is inches away from scoring 10/10, it's only the familiarity of the core gameplay that makes it feel less than the very, very best. But it's definitely the biggest, and if this is the finale, then God of War III gives PlayStation's toughest hero the send-off he deserves.\" Ditum also praised the graphics, stating it was as good if not better than Killzone 2 and Uncharted 2: Among Thieves. IGN (9.3/10) praised the game stating that \"God of War III practically redefines what the word 'scale' means with regards to videogames, as it throws you into scenes with Titans that are larger than entire levels in some other games.\" The only complaint the IGN reviewer had was \"that two of the three additional weapons that you'll earn are extremely similar to your blades. They have unique powers and slightly different moves, but by and large, they're more of the same.\" In terms of visuals, the reviewer said that \"God of War III presents some of the most impressive visuals that I've ever seen in a game. Kratos in particular looks phenomenal, and is perhaps the single most impressive-looking character ever in videogames.\" GameSpot (9.0/10) stated God of War III sticks to the strengths already established by its predecessors, but what it lacks in innovation it more than makes up for in execution. The combat is simple to pick up, but the added moves and weapons give it more depth than before, and the spectacular visuals make fights even more brutal. But God of War III is so much more than its satisfying combat. The imaginative visual design and moody classical score balance your quest for vengeance with artistic pleasures, and the well-crafted puzzles further tap into your cerebral vein. God of War III is a brilliantly paced, meticulously detailed adventure that thrills and satisfies until the very end.Awards  God of War III was awarded \"Most Anticipated Game of 2010\" at the 2009 Spike Video Game Awards and GameTrailers awarded God of War III with the \"GameTrailers Diamond Award\" for exceeding ten million views. At the 2010 Spike Video Game Awards, God of War III was awarded \"Best PS3 Game\" and \"Best Graphics\", with the character Kratos winning the \"Biggest Badass\" award.

The Olympian gods had a king, Zeus, who reigned over both man and god from his divine throne on Mount Olympus. They served as minor protagonists in the first game, helping Kratos with his quest to kill Ares; however, as the series progressed, they turned into one of the series' main antagonists.Greek Mythology  The gods, along with the Titans, are supreme mythical beings that can create and control all kinds of magic and power. In Greek mythology, the gods, also called the Olympians (\u0394\u03c9\u03b4\u03b5\u03ba\u03ac\u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03bd), were the principal gods of the Greek pantheon, residing atop Mount Olympus, a place forbidden for any mortal to travel unless given direct authorization to do so by the gods themselves. The 6 original Olympians were Hades, Hestia, Poseidon, Demeter, Hera, and Zeus. Later on there were 12 true Olympians, which included: Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Demeter, Ares, Hermes, Hephaestus, Aphrodite, Athena, Apollo, Artemis, Dionysus and Hestia, who later gave up her throne for Dionysus. Hades was not included because he resided in his home of the Underworld, rarely speaking with any of the other gods. The 12 mighty Olympians gained their supremacy in the world after Zeus led his siblings to victory in the war with the Titans. The six original Olympians were the children of Cronos and Rhea (Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Demeter, Hestia, and Hades). Ares, Hermes, Hephaestus, Athena, Apollo, Artemis, the Charites, Hercules, Dionysus, the Muses, Hebe, and Persephone were children of Zeus and Aphrodite was born\u00a0of\u00a0sea foam from\u00a0Ouranos's remains were all later recognized as Olympians. Helios, Eos, and Selene are other important Olympians and goddesses which are sometimes included in a group of twelve. Greeks of good age knew of poetry about the war between the Gods and Titans. The dominant one, and the only one that had survived was in the Theogony attributed to Hesiod. A lost epic, Titanomachia - attributed to the legendary blind Thracian bard Thamyris - was not mentioned in passing in an essay 'Music on Music' that was once attributed to Plutarch.In-Game History Description  Gods made their appearances in every installment and are an important element in the series. They first appeared as the main allies of Kratos, granting him powerful magics and weapons throughout his journey. After Zeus' betrayal, Kratos allies with the Titans in the hopes of obtaining revenge against Zeus, declaring war on the rest of Olympus as well. By God of War III, they are the main group of antagonists whom Kratos kills, one after another.Birth and Prophecy  In the beginning, there was Chaos, the first primordial void from which all of creation came. From Chaos came the Island of Creation and together with the Island, the Sisters of Fate were born as some of the first creatures of the world. Over time, the Titans evolved from the island itself, becoming the source of all nature and magic.\u00a0 Later, the Titans left the island and forged the rest of the world. Reigning over the Titans, the mighty Cronos learned from Gaia that one day he would be overthrown by his own children. In an attempt to gain their favor, Cronos gifted the Sisters with the Steeds of Time. Although they accepted the gift, they refused to change his fate. Trying to prevent the inevitable, Cronos devoured his children born of Rhea one by one: Poseidon, Hades, Hera, Demeter and Hestia. When the time came that the last of his children, Zeus, was to be swallowed, Rhea could not bear another such loss. She devised a plan to have Zeus taken to a place far away from the watchful eyes of his cruel father. Calling upon the eagle, Rhea kissed her son goodbye as he was taken to be watched over by Gaia. Rhea wrapped a\u00a0stone in cloth and Cronos swallowed it, foolishly believing it to be Zeus.Great War  Under the care of Gaia, Zeus was raised with the desire to free his siblings from the belly of Cronos. When he came of age, he journeyed back to the Island of Creation and forced Cronos to regurgitate his siblings. Fully grown, these new gods came to be known as the Olympians, and started a war against the Titans, thus betraying Gaia, whose act of compassion would haunt the Titans for the rest of their lives. Atlas led the Titans into a furious battle, although some Titans, like Prometheus and Helios, would betray their fellow Titans and join the Olympians. Hades and Poseidon managed to bring Atlas to his knees and steal his soul, but this would not stop the Titans from continuing their efforts to eliminate the Olympians. The war would completely reshape the landscape of the mortal world into its current shape. Zeus forged a weapon from both the heavens and the Earth called the Blade of Olympus, which was used to banish the Titans to the darkest pits of the Underworld \u2013 Tartarus. This battle also caused evils to accumulate, which would later be stored in Pandora's Box to protect humanity from corruption.Aftermath  The Titans were brutally tortured for eternity as a permanent reminder of what they had done, despite Cronos being the only Titan who had done anything wrong in the first place. Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades split the world into three. Zeus was given domain over the heavens and was ultimately the ruler of both the gods and all of the universe; Poseidon was given domain over all forms of water, controlling the seas, winds and weather; Hades was given domain over the Underworld, the darkest realm of the world where the souls of the dead would journey. Prometheus, caring for the lowly mortals, gave them the fires of Mount Olympus, which Zeus perceived as a betrayal. In response, Zeus robbed Prometheus of his immortality and forced him to endure great suffering by having an eagle consume him every day, fully healing and resurrecting him each time so that this cycle of torment would never cease. Helios, however, became the god of the sun and light and was accepted in the Greek pantheon.Birth of the Evils  As mentioned previously, the conclusion of the Great War also marked the birth of the Evils, ethereal manifestations of all of the world's vices and corruption. Zeus, realizing the danger they posed if left free, commissioned Hephaestus to construct a vessel to contain them -Pandora's Box- which would be placed within the Flame of Olympus to ensure that no one could ever release the Evils within. However, upon completing the box, Hephaestus recommended the back of Cronos as the best place to hide it, reasoning that no one would be able to defeat the mighty Titan to reach it. Unbeknownst to Zeus, Hephaestus' choice was an attempt to protect Pandora, the living key to the Flame of Olympus whom Hephaestus had come to see as his own daughter. With that matter settled, Zeus drew the Evils into Pandora's Box. Athena also placed the essence of Hope inside the box, as a means to counteract the Evils in the event that the box was ever opened.Pandora's Temple  The gods appeared before the architect, Pathos Verdes III, tasking him with the construction of a temple to house Pandora's Box. After building the temple, Cronos was forced to carry it on his back and wander the Desert of Lost Souls until the fierce desert winds ripped the flesh from his body. When called upon with the Titan Horn, he would have to allow warriors to climb upon him and journey through the temple. Following the deaths of his children, Pathos Verdes III grew more and more insane as he built the many traps and puzzles within the temple, eventually murdering his wife and committing suicide.The Birth of a Beast  Zeus, the King of Olympus, was famous for his numerous erotic escapades with other women. He was married to Hera, the Queen of Olympus, who bore him the God of War Ares and the Smith God Hephaestus. Before his marriage to Hera, Zeus had been married to the Titan Metis. After being informed of a prophecy by Gaia, which foretold that the\u00a0son of Metis would overthrow Olympus, Zeus turned Metis into a fly and swallowed her whole. She had already been gifted with a child however, who was born from the head of Zeus. This child came to be known as the goddess Athena. In Sparta, Zeus, together with a mortal woman named Callisto, became the father of two warriors, with the oldest one\u00a0being Kratos and\u00a0the youngest\u00a0one being Deimos. Callisto, however, was forbidden by Zeus to tell either child who their father was. Around this time, the\u00a0Oracle foretold that one of Zeus' sons, a \"Marked Warrior\", would one day rebel against Zeus and kill him. As Kratos' brother Deimos had been born with a strange birthmark, Zeus ordered Ares and Athena to abduct Deimos and bring him to Thanatos, the God of Death. Kratos attempted to save his brother, only for Ares to swat him aside, knocking him into a pile of wood. Enraged by the mortal's defiance, Ares drew his blade with the intention of killing the young Kratos, but Athena intervened, telling Ares that they had what they came for before apologizing to Kratos and departing back to the Heavens. The loss of his brother left an indelible mark on Kratos, as he vowed to never falter again. In honor of his brother, Kratos had himself tattooed in the exact image of Deimos' birthmark.Ares' Champion  As he grew older, Kratos became a fearsome and well-respected Spartan captain. However, during a fierce battle with the barbarians of the East, his life seemed destined for an early end. In a moment of desperation, Kratos called upon Ares, pledging himself to the God of War in return for the death of his foes. Seeing potential in the young warrior, Ares obliged, slaying the barbarians and giving Kratos the Blades of Chaos as a mark of his new allegiance. With his Spartan companions, Kratos (now a general) served Ares\u2019 will and slaughtered thousands of innocents in his name. Feeling Kratos could become far stronger by eliminating any weaknesses, Ares deceived his servant into burning down the village where Kratos\u2019 wife and child were present. Blinded by bloodlust, Kratos was warned by the Village Oracle that if he were to enter the main temple within the village, he would be haunted for the rest of his life. Ignoring her plea, Kratos entered the temple and killed everyone inside, including his wife and child. Kratos believed that his wife and child were back home in Sparta, and was thus horrified to see their corpses before him. Ares appeared before Kratos, revealing that it was he who had placed his family in the temple and that with nothing left in his way, he would become death incarnate. Kratos ignored Ares\u2019 arrogance and learned that he was tricked by the very god who once saved his life. The Village Oracle gathered the ashes of Kratos\u2019 loved ones and fastened them to his skin, permanently reminding him of the greatest sin he committed. Vengeful and despairing, Kratos' goal now was to serve Olympus and redeem himself, and in the future take his revenge upon Ares.Pursued by the Furies  For breaking his oath, Ares sent the Furies to capture Kratos and force him to once again serve the God of War. Kratos was trapped in an illusion of his home in Sparta, but Orkos appeared before him and encouraged him to see past the illusion, using Lysandra's necklace and ring as totem to discern reality from illusion. Though Kratos distrusted him, he followed Orkos' instruction to seek out Aletheia, the Oracle at Delphi. The Oracle was captured by Pollux and Castor, and Kratos took the Amulet of Uroborus from them after he killed them. Kratos traveled to the Harbor of Kirra where he encountered Orkos again. The oath keeper revealed that he is the son of Ares and Alecto. Ares wanted a perfect warrior who could help him overthrow Zeus, thus allowing Ares to rule Olympus for himself. Disappointed in Orkos, Ares disowned his son, and Orkos became the oath keeper of the Furies to please his mother. He explained that Kratos was the warrior Ares sought and for that reason, Ares helped Kratos against the barbarians. The murder of his family was meant to be one of three \"tests\" that would bind Kratos to Ares's will. Orkos did his bidding as the oath keeper and did not question the Furies until Ares tricked Kratos into killing his family. Armed with this knowledge, Kratos took a ship to Delos. Kratos arrives at the island of Delos and traverses a giant, ruined statue of Apollo. He is attacked by all three Furies and manages to cut off Megaera's arm, but Alecto uses her power to capture Kratos. Orkos appears and frees Kratos, taking him elsewhere upon the statue, with Alecto vowing that he will never succeed. After a perilous journey, Kratos uses the Amulet of Uroborus to fully restore the statue and retrieve the Eyes from the Lantern. Unfortunately, after completing the Trials of Archimedes, he is ambushed by the Furies once more, who take him captive and steal the Eyes and the Amulet. Over the next two weeks, Kratos is tortured by the Furies in the Prison of the Damned. He managed to free himself when Megaera went too far with her torture. He then pursued the Fury through the prison. She and Tisiphone attempted to misdirect him, as a building he enters is projected as a brothel. When he goes to sleep with a woman, he spots the ring on her finger and realizes that this is an illusion. Kratos tackles the woman, who is revealed to be Tisiphone. Megaera intervenes, however, insisting that Kratos belongs to her and releasing insects into Aegaeon's hands and mouth, thus mutating its prisoners into insect-titan hybrids. After Kratos killed Megaera and Aegeaon, retrieving the Amulet of Uroboros, Tisiphone creates an illusion of him being honored by the King of Sparta. But again, Kratos sees through it. He soon finds the Scribe of Hecatonchires, who reveals that both Ares and the Furies planned to overthrow Zeus. The Scribe was the first to be imprisoned by the Furies, and although they were originally fair in their punishment, they became ruthless under Ares' influence. Making his way to Alecto's chamber, Kratos manages to retrieve the Oath Stone from Tisiphone's pet bird, Daimon. But upon entering the chamber, the Furies project another illusion, this time of Kratos' home in Sparta. Kratos is nearly taken in by this, for he got to see his wife and daughter again. He grows close to sleeping with the image of Lysandra but notices the ring on her finger, instantly recognizing it to be an illusion. \"Lysandra\" is revealed to be Alecto, who tries to convince Kratos that he could live in this illusion if he rejoined Ares; however, noticing the Eyes of Truth hanging on her hip, he defiantly refused, preferring the truth to living a lie. Enraged, Alecto drops the illusion and threatens to execute him if he would not serve. Kratos breaks free of her sludge trap and manages to snatch the Eyes from Alecto, who retreats deeper into her sanctum before she realized they were gone. Tisiphone joined Alecto as Kratos advanced on the remaining Furies. They created an illusion of a massive whirlpool, with Alecto transforming into Caribdis the sea monster. Using the Eyes, Kratos broke through the Furies' illusions and forced Alecto back into her human form. As he advanced on the Fury Queen, Tisiphone dispatched Daimon against him but Kratos simply used the Eyes to destroy the bird. He proceeded to physically charge at Tisiphone, as she shapeshifted between the forms of the King and Kratos himself, belittling him. As he wrapped his hands around her throat, Tisiphone transformed into Lysandra, causing Kratos to briefly cease his assault before shrugging it off and continuing his onslaught. Tisiphone then changed into the Village Oracle, telling him that his family was not there that night he killed them by chance, before Kratos snapped her neck, killing her. With Alecto left for last, Kratos drew his blades. The Fury Queen coldly tells him that the truth would only bring him pain before he plunges his blades into her chest. With her last breath, Alecto spitefully promises that her death would change nothing before Kratos kills her. Kratos returned to his home in Sparta, where he was met by Orkos. Although praising Kratos' victory over the Furies, he reveals that he was remade the oath keaper once again, maintaining Kratos' bond to Ares. He begged Kratos to give him an honorable death, as it would free them both from the god, to which Kratos refused, proclaiming that no more innocent blood should be spilled. However, Orkos' continuing requests ultimately forced Kratos' hand. After killing Orkos, Kratos experienced the first of his many nightmares, previously masked by his bond to Ares: this was the price he had to pay for the truth. He also discovered his path to redemption through continual service to Olympus. Kratos proceeded to burn down his house, with the corpse of Orkos inside it.Servitude to the Gods  For ten years, Kratos served the Olympian gods, in hopes of gaining their forgiveness and releasing him from the nightmares of his past. In one notable instance, he was defending the city of Attica from a Persian assault when Helios was kidnapped from the sky by the freed Titan Atlas, who used the power of the sun to destroy the Pillar of the World. It was because of Persephone that Atlas was released from his torture, for she wanted nothing more than to be free of her miserable existence. Kratos saved the world by leaving his daughter in Elysium and destroying Persephone, who told him that he would never be free from his nightmares. He then enchained Atlas to uphold the world on his shoulders, where the mighty Titan claimed the two would meet again. Poseidon had been angered by the chaos and destruction left behind by the Hydra. As Kratos journeyed through the Aegean Sea, he noticed a massive shipwreck caused by the creature. He was called upon by the Sea God to rid the waters of the Hydra, granting him the ability of Poseidon's Rage, an attack that would create a devastating blow on the creature. Ares' jealousy towards Athena grew ever so strong, and he called upon the creatures of the Underworld to invade Athens. Zeus had forbidden the gods from waging war on each other and so Athena looked to Kratos for help. With her guidance, Kratos was given Medusa's Gaze from Aphrodite, Zeus' Fury from Zeus, the Blade of Artemis from Artemis, and the Army of Hades from Hades. Kratos retrieved Pandora\u2019s Box and used its power to become powerful enough to face Ares. Using the Blade of the Gods, Kratos managed to kill Ares once and for all. Although he was forgiven of his sins, the gods refused to free\u00a0 Kratos from the memories that haunted him. Knowing that he would never be free from his sins, Kratos attempted suicide by jumping from the peak of the highest mountain in Greece, until he was saved by Athena and granted Ares' now empty throne on Olympus.Kratos, New God of War  As the new god of war, Kratos was far more ruthless than Ares ever was. Kratos, still plagued by memories of his murdered family, grew fiercely bitter towards the gods for refusing to erase the memories of his past deeds and for their role in the capture and death of his brother, Deimos\u00a0and forcing him to kill his beloved mother Callisto. Thinking of the gods as pathetic and weak, he found solace by leading Sparta in conquering the rest of Greece. Upset by this very fact, the gods became enraged with Kratos\u2019 defiance and Zeus began to fear for his life. Athena tried to prevent Kratos from further destroying any more cities, warning him that the wrath of Olympus would soon present Kratos with the consequence of his actions. Ignoring her, Kratos helped his Spartan comrades take over the city of Rhodes.Zeus' Betrayal  As Kratos aided his Spartan army as the God of War, Zeus (in the form of an eagle) sapped Kratos of most of his power, causing him to shrink to the size of a mortal. Subsequently, Zeus transferred this power to the Colossus of Rhodes, bringing it to life. Zeus, feigning allegiance with Kratos, tricked him into draining the rest of his godly Powers into the Blade of Olympus. Kratos was rendered mortal, as Zeus revealed himself to have orchestrated the fight between the Colossus and Kratos, betraying him and killing him using the blade.Kratos' Rebellion  While in the Underworld, Kratos was faced by Gaia, who told him that the Titans would help overthrow Zeus, only if he were to journey to the Island of Creation and defeat the Sisters of Fate. Kratos escaped and rose once again, this time bent on revenge against Zeus.The Fate of Sparta  Zeus had gone to the Sisters earlier because of his paranoia involving Kratos\u2019 brutality. The Sisters told Zeus that Kratos was the son destined to overthrow him but that Zeus would be the victor in the end. Believing Kratos was dead, Zeus proceeded to destroy Sparta. Thinking that it was all over, he returned to his throne on Mount Olympus. Kratos learned of Sparta\u2019s fate via the Last Spartan, becoming enraged and continuing his journey to kill Zeus, more determined than ever.Battle with the Fates  The murals within the Hall of the Fates had depictions of their prophecies, both of the past and future. In one of the murals, the Olympians and the Titans were seen engaging in battle, which could either represent the original Titanomachy or the events of the Second Great War. In the second mural, a lone man, probably Kratos, stood amidst the destruction left behind. In the third mural, three men were walking towards a star in the sky, alluding the journey of the Three Wise Men towards the birth of Christ guided by the Star of Bethlehem. This represents the rise of Christianity after the downfall of Olympus and could signify that the Twilight of the Greek Gods occurred paving the way for the coming of Christ. After killing the Sisters, Kratos went back in time to the point where he was betrayed by Zeus. The Ghost of Sparta plunged himself at the king of the gods, and a great battle ensued. Arriving upon the Summit of Sacrifice, Kratos fought with great ferocity.Intervention  Using the Blade of Olympus, Kratos stabbed Zeus multiple times before being stopped by Athena. Protecting her father, she flung herself in front of Kratos and was stabbed instead. Zeus fled to Olympus while Kratos spoke with Athena. She revealed that he was Zeus' son and that a vicious cycle of revenge had been passed down by his bloodline. After she died, Kratos used the power of time to journey back to the final moments of the Great War, bringing the Titans with him to destroy the Gods once and for all.Second Titanomachy  The Second Titanomachy, also known as the second Great War, started with Zeus calling upon the Gods to discuss the events that had been occurring. He claimed that he would wipe out the plague created by Kratos and that the gods must unite to crush him. Olympus began to shake, and the Gods looked over the edge of the mountain. The Titans, led by Kratos, climbed towards the Olympians in hopes of destroying them. The Gods immediately responded to the threat of the Titans crawling up Mount Olympus. Helios, Hermes, Hercules, and Hades engaged the Titans head on, while Poseidon waits with Zeus. Overlooking the battle, Zeus saw the Titans and Gods were evenly matched.The King of the Gods thus decided to have Poseidon enter the fray. The God of Seas entered the battle, leaping off the top of Olympus, targeting the Titan Epimetheus. Hurled forward in a blast of water, Poseidon leaped right through Epimetheus' chest, killing him instantly and knocking him off the mountain into the waters below. With the help of his Hippocampi, which erupted from the water, Poseidon pulled at least one Titan off Mount Olympus before reaching Kratos and Gaia, in the form of a colossal watery construct. After a long and hard struggle, Kratos and Gaia combined their efforts, managing to kill the God of the Sea, with the Spartan gouging his eyes and snapping his neck. As Poseidon's corpse fell from Olympus, he began to disintegrate into a liquid mass and landed in the water. As a result of his death, the sea levels rose dramatically and massive waves ravaged the world, engulfing all but the highest mountain tops. Victorious from their battle with Poseidon, Kratos and Gaia reached Zeus, who then summoned a lightning bolt to blast them off the mountain, resulting in Kratos falling into the Underworld. In the Underworld, Kratos met with three Gods: a depressed Hephaestus, an infuriated Hades, and a spectral Athena. Eventually, Kratos reached Hades palace in the Underworld, leading to a fierce battle between the two. The battle reached its end when Kratos stole the Claws of Hades and used them to take Hades' soul, thereby releasing all of the dead souls from their torment.  The souls of the River Styx then attacked Hades, tearing a hole in his abdomen and leaving his corpse to rot underwater. After leaving the Underworld, Kratos met Helios, the God of the Sun, in the war-torn city of Olympia. Helios was still engaged in combat with the Titan Perses when Kratos reached the site of the battle. With the help of a Ballista, Kratos knocked Helios and his chariot into the grasp of Perses, who crushed and tossed the Sun God across the city. When Kratos found Helios, the gravely injured God appealed to Kratos to save him in exchange for any favor the Ghost of Sparta wanted, Kratos demanded to know the location of the Flame of Olympus, but Helios taunted him for his adamant desire to kill Zeus. When Kratos was about to beat him for answers, Helios called upon the power of the sun, temporarily blinding Kratos, but the latter managed to subdue Helios. In desperation, Helios attempted to trick Kratos into stepping into the Flame of Olympus, telling him that he would receive its power by doing so. Kratos wasn't fooled, as he had been told earlier by Hephaestus that the Flame was lethal to those who touch it, be they, man or god. Helios warned Kratos that his death would not lead him to Zeus, but Kratos had other ideas and decapitated the Sun God with his bare hands. Helios' decapitated head served Kratos as a weapon and a flashlight. The death of Helios resulted in the Sun being enshrouded by darkness and a torrential rainfall upon the world.  Kratos next encountered Hermes, taunting him with his super speed, and running up the Chain of Balance, after which Kratos followed. Eventually, Kratos caught up with Hermes, leading to a chase in which Kratos struggled to keep up. Through the use of a catapult, Kratos used his Blades of Exile to latch on to the catapult's stone as it hurled towards the statue of Athena where Hermes was perched, destroying the statue, putting Hermes off-balance and greatly weakening him. After a brief battle, another God fell, and with the death of Hermes, millions of insects flew from his disintegrating body, infecting the world, thus creating the Plague of Olympus. Kratos next encountered Hera and her step-son Hercules (Kratos' half-brother). After mercilessly beating Hercules to death, Kratos fell into the sewers. Emerging from the sewers, Kratos encountered Aphrodite in her chambers. She directed Kratos to a nearby portal, which he used to travel back to the Underworld, where he once again found Hephaestus.  Alarmed by the realization that Kratos was searching for Pandora herself, he sent Kratos on a suicide mission to find the Omphalos Stone in the hopes that Cronos would kill him. After a battle against the massive Titan, Cronos swallowed Kratos, who proceeded to break free using the Blade of Olympus, spilling his intestines in the process. Kratos returned to Hephaestus, who crafted the Nemesis Whip from the Omphalos Stone. He then found his end attempting to kill Kratos so that his daughter, Pandora, would be protected from him. Hera encountered Kratos within her gardens, and taunted him, saying his simple mind would not allow him to escape. He did, however, and after Hera goaded him even more, calling Pandora a \"little whore\", he snapped her neck. With the death of another Olympian, all the green life on at least Greece dies. While Kratos brought the Labyrinth to Olympus, Zeus awaited him. Both father and son dueled around the remains of Olympus, but Pandora eventually reached the Flame of Olympus, resulting in her death. Kratos, once again opened Pandora's Box, hoping to use its power against Zeus, but was disappointed and shocked to learn that nothing was inside the box, while the King of Gods laughed at his son's failure. After yet another arduous battle between the two, Kratos finally killed his father, beating him to death. With the death of the last Olympian, massive amounts of lightning left his body, and entered the sky, plunging the world into Chaos as well as the chains bound to the Gods were shattered from Kratos. With this, Ares' plan was complete: Kratos had become the perfect warrior, killed Zeus and destroyed the rule of Olympus. Athena then appeared and asked Kratos to give back the power of Hope, which he had unknowingly used to defeat Zeus. Instead, Kratos impaled himself with the Blade of Olympus, to give Hope to all the mortals of the world. Athena left, disappointed by Kratos's actions, and the rule of the Olympian gods came to an end. The rest of the\u00a0Gods left unscathed by Kratos' genocidal rampage (i.e. Apollo, Artemis, Dionysus, etc.) through unknown means were apparently either killed by the Titans or perished in the ensuing Chaos.Physical appearance  Many of the gods are indistinguishable from humans in appearance, though some look radically different. Also noteworthy is the fact that when a God dies, a catastrophic event occurs like an explosion or a devastating occurrence that is sometimes called a plague. The plague is based on what the god personifies like great flood of waters (Poseidon), deadly swarms of flies (Hermes), the sun being blocked out by the clouds in the sky (Helios), and the souls of the dead escaping (Hades). The weaker gods, like Ceryx, however, die without any major consequences, as do Hephaestus, Ares and Athena (the latter two of whom after their death only release a large explosion). However, it is possible that these events are not major enough to warrant much attention.Powers & Abilities  In addition to being immortal, the gods are superhuman beings. It's assumed that most of the gods in the God of War series possess the following: Some gods have specific powers that correlate to their Godly roles, as Zeus possesses projection and can conjure lightning, Poseidon can conjure and manipulate the element of water, and Hades possessing soul manipulation. It is unknown if the gods can resurrect those who have died. Some gods, like Zeus, Poseidon and Hades are considered the physically strongest, having immense powers compared to that of their ancestors. Others, like Ares, Athena, and Persephone, are somewhat weaker then their parents, but share similar levels in power. There are some minor, weaker Gods, like Ceryx or the Fire Steeds, that are considered servants to the Gods, and have no real power of their own but are still powerfully divine. While able to sustain great levels of damage, some Gods have been shown to die by injuries fatal to mortals. Athena died with a single stab of the Blade of Olympus, even though her father Zeus survived multiple impalements by the weapon, albeit Zeus was stronger than her to begin with, and the divine weapon was one of the few that gave the user the power to kill a God. The god Hephastus, however, died after being impaled upon his only anvil, which had apparently no special characteristics mystical or otherwise (though it can be assumed that Zeus stripped Hephastus of most of godly abilities). The Goddess Hera died by having Kratos break her neck. While this was a similar fate shared by her brother Poseidon, he was more vulnerable due to having fought both Kratos and Gaia. The increased vulnerability could also be due to the fact that Kratos possessed the Blade of Olympus, which could have rendered Poseidon's regenerative abilities useless in its presence. Probably Gods and Goddesses simply cease to exist if they are killed. Nevertheless, in some circustances they can ascend to the Astral Form after death. This is what happened to Athena and, for a short period of time, to Zeus. How and when a deity can continue his existence through this way is still unclear.The Olympian Gods  These are all the gods and goddesses who appear and/or are mentioned in the God of War series:Olympians Pre-Olympian Gods Demigods Trivia Zeus  Zeus (Greek: \u0396\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2) was the youngest child of the Titan King Cronos, who ascended to become the King of Olympus and the God of the Sky, Thunder, Lightning, and the Heavens. He acted as an ally in God of War and also served as the main antagonist of both God of War II and God of War III, and was the biological father of most of the gods of Olympus and many famous demigods such as Hercules, Perseus, Peirithous and even the Spartan warrior Kratos as well as his brother Deimos.Greek Mythology  In Greek Mythology, Zeus was the King of the Gods, ruler of Olympus, and God of the Sky, Heavens, and Lightning. Zeus was youngest of his six siblings. His symbols were the Lightning bolt, the Eagle, the Oak Tree and the Bull. Zeus was the youngest son of Cronos\u00a0and Rhea. He was very well known for his erotic escapades with beautiful mortal women, resulting in many godly and heroic offspring, including Athena, Apollo, Artemis, Hermes, Persephone, Dionysus, Perseus, Hercules, Helen and Minos. When the loss of his older siblings by their father Cronos became too great for Rhea to bare any longer, she hid him from Cronos far away, giving him a stone to swallow instead. Once grown, the young God sought to free his siblings and overthrow his father. Disguised as a cup-bearer, Zeus mixed a brew into Cronos' wine, causing him to vomit up the stone that had taken his place, and then his siblings. Overthrowing the Titans, Zeus castrated Cronos and banished him to Tartarus. Later drawing lots with his brothers Poseidon and Hades to determine who would rule the skies, oceans, and the Underworld, Zeus won the sky, and became the King of Olympus. Some sources claim that Zeus is technically the eldest, due to being the only child to not be kept from the world and trapped in their father's stomach, though this is disputable, and some claim fabricated by Zeus himself to lend validity to his claim to the sky before he and his brothers decided to draw lots. His counterpart in Roman Mythology is Jupiter and was known as Ba'al Hadad to the Canaanites/Israelites.In the God of War Series Birth  During the reign of the Titans, Cronos\u00a0was informed of a prophecy foretelling his eventual downfall at the hands of one of his own sons. To prevent this fate, Cronos swallowed all of his children, one by one. When Zeus was born, his mother Rhea\u00a0was distraught at the loss of her first five children and devised a trick to save him by letting an eagle carry the baby Zeus to safety, while he was replaced by a stone wrapped in cloth\u00a0which Cronos devoured, having mistaken it for Zeus. The eagle then carried the infant Zeus to Gaia\u00a0so that he would be raised and blessed with the strength to stand up to Cronos. During this time, Zeus developed a deep hatred for his father, and looked forward to the day he would finally release his siblings; one of Zeus' drawings inside Gaia portray him opening Cronos' belly and setting them free.\u00a0The Great War  As he came of age, Zeus decided to put his plans into action. Zeus freed his siblings and\u00a0declared war on all of the Titans, thus betraying Gaia. The new rulers of the world, the Gods, calling themselves Olympians, fought against their predecessors with great ferocity and power. The battle between the Gods and the Titans formed the landscape of the mortal world, shaking the earth with massive earthquakes and crumbling mountains. To end the war, Zeus created the all-powerful Blade of Olympus, which was used to banish the Titans to the foulest pits of Tartarus. However, the Evils borne from the war posed another threat to Olympus, so Zeus commissioned Hephaestus, the Smith God, to build Pandora's Box in order to house the Evils. Unbeknownst to him, Athena called forth a power that transcended any God, Hope, and placed it inside the box to counteract the Evils should the box ever be opened. When Zeus asked Hephaestus where to hide the box, the Smith God suggested that it should be placed on the back of Cronos. Using the architect Pathos Verdes III, he constructed an enormous temple to house the box and then chained it to the Titan's back, sentencing him to wander the Desert of Lost Souls for all eternity. Little did the great Zeus know that the events that had just transpired would eventually doom him.After the Great War  At some point, Zeus had an affair with a mortal woman named Callisto. The circumstances are unknown, but the affair resulted in two sons. The oldest one was Kratos, a mighty warrior with unstoppable rage and ambition. Hera, displeased with Zeus for fathering yet another illegitimate child and (correctly) predicting that his existence would eventually doom Olympus, demanded that he kill the boy immediately after his birth. Zeus, at this point still a somewhat benevolent and caring figure, took pity on the child and refused. Around the same time, however, the\u00a0Oracle foretold that one of Zeus' sons, a \"marked warrior\", would rise up against the King of the Gods and kill him. Noticing the strange birthmarks on the youngest son of Zeus and Callisto, Deimos, he sent Ares and Athena to Sparta in order to capture the boy and bring him to Thanatos. Later on in Kratos' life, having brutally slain his own family in blind anger due to a scheme by Ares, the newly christened \"Ghost of Sparta\" pledged to serve the Gods of Olympus, including his father Zeus, in the hopes that they would relieve him of his nightmares. This can be compared to the fate of his half-brother Hercules, who had also killed his family in a madness caused by Hera. About halfway through Kratos' penance, Zeus was one of the many Gods that fell victim to an enchanted slumber, orchestrated by Morpheus when the Sun God, Helios, was kidnapped by the Titan Atlas. Kratos eventually discovered that this was the work of Persephone, who intended to use the Sun God to empower\u00a0Atlas in order to destroy the Pillar of the World and bring an end to all life, as well as her own suffering. Fortunately for Zeus and the other gods, Kratos was able to defeat the Queen of the Underworld and save Helios, returning him to the sky and forcing Morpheus to retreat. What they did not know was that Kratos had been forced to relinquish any hopes of reuniting with his beloved daughter in the process of saving the world, pushing his disillusionment with the Gods ever closer to open hatred and rebellion. Near the end of Kratos' service, Ares besieged the city of Athens in the hopes of gaining Zeus' favor over his sister, Athena. Zeus, having forbidden the Gods from waging war on each other and fearing the possibility that Ares might be the \"Marked Warrior\" who would overthrow Zeus, allowed Athena to receive help from Kratos. Athena told him that killing Ares would complete his penance and rid him of his past sins. During his quest, Kratos met Zeus himself within the damaged city of Athens, where he was given Zeus' Fury, the ability to wield and throw powerful lighting bolts. In addition, Zeus took on the mortal guise of a Grave Digger and created a portal to the Underworld via a grave he claimed to be digging for Kratos, allowing the Spartan to escape the realm of the dead (after Ares impaled the Spartan with a pillar) late in his adventure. Retrieving Pandora's Box from Kratos' dead corpse, Ares yelled to the skies, cursing his father for constantly favoring Athena and asking Zeus if he could finally see what his son was capable of. Ares declared that he would not hesitate to use the Box against Olympus itself, only for Kratos to return from the Underworld and use a bolt of Zeus' Fury to reclaim it. Kratos opened the ancient artifact and harnessed its power to kill Ares, his former master. Zeus and the Gods guided Kratos to kill Ares, as they had incorrectly believed that he was the only real threat to Olympus. The Olympians rewarded Kratos by forgiving him for the crime of killing his own family (although, to Kratos' dismay, they were unable to remove the horrible memories from his mind), and made him the new God of War.Zeus' Betrayal  It was believed that Deimos is the Marked Warrior so it is very possible that Deimos' death and Kratos' destructive and aggressive behaviour led Zeus into believing that Kratos is the Marked Warrior who would seek revenge against the Gods of Olympus and one day destroy them. Another moment which led Zeus betray Kratos is when Kratos told Athena that the Gods would pay for that... Even though Kratos did not know that the grave digger was actually Zeus, he was there when Kratos exclaimed these words. Later on in Rhodes, Zeus tricked Kratos, told him to cast his powers into the Blade of Olympus and with that act, Zeus found a way to take it and kill Kratos as long as his powers would not be inside Kratos himself. It is later revealed that Zeus and the other Gods had fallen prey to the Evils locked away in Pandora's Box after Kratos opened it to kill Ares. Apparently, Zeus didn't realize that if Kratos used the Box, the Evils would be released onto them; he had instead hoped that the Evils would fuel Kratos. As a result, Zeus was overwhelmed by his personal plague: Fear. Overcome with extreme paranoia and frightened by Kratos' increasingly destructive behavior, Zeus soon realized that Kratos would be the one to perpetuate the cycle of son killing father. Just as Cronos killed Ouranus, and as Zeus himself defeated Cronos, the King of the Gods expected that Kratos, infuriated by the revelation that not even the Gods could end his nightmares, would kill Zeus. Zeus' fears were further exacerbated by Kratos' open defiance of the other Gods, ignoring their demands that he cease his relentless conquest and destruction of Greece. During Kratos' attack on Rhodes, Zeus devised a scheme that would put an end to Kratos' reign. He disguised himself as an eagle and drained a portion of the new God of War's power, transferring it to the Colossus of Rhodes. This caused the statue to come alive and attack the now mortal-sized Kratos, who initially believed that Athena was the one who betrayed him. Zeus further took advantage of the situation by tricking Kratos into infusing the rest of his god powers into the Blade of Olympus, the weapon that brought an end to the Great War of the Gods and Titans. Upon doing so, Kratos destroyed the Colossus with ease, but was crushed under the crumbling statue's hand soon afterwards, weakening the Spartan to the brink of death. Thus, in order to survive, he needed to retrieve the Blade, which had been knocked out of his grasp by the falling Colossus. As Kratos was about to reach the Blade, Zeus finally revealed himself, admitting responsibility to Kratos for everything that had just transpired. Zeus claimed that his motivation was to \"undo Athena's mistake\" (presumably the act of making Kratos a God) and prevent Ares' fate from becoming his own. The King of the Gods then ordered the Spartan to submit, but an outraged Kratos refused, causing Zeus to stab him with the Blade of Olympus. As Kratos slowly died, Zeus expressed his disappointment in Kratos, insisting that the Spartan warrior had made the wrong choice. However, Kratos continued to insult the King of Olympus, and Zeus responded by stabbing him with the Blade again, telling his son that the cycle\u00a0has come to an end, and everything that he ever knew would now suffer because of his sacrilege. Zeus then destroyed all of the soldiers present, while a dying Kratos promised that he would have his revenge as Zeus leaves and casts Kratos into the Underworld. Upon leaving Rhodes, Zeus proceeded to destroy Sparta not only because the Spartan people worshipped Kratos, but to further punish Kratos himself. After destroying Sparta, Zeus believed he finally dealt with Kratos and returned to his throne on Mount Olympus.Kratos' Revenge  Unfortunately for Zeus, Kratos was far from finished. Aided by Gaia and the Titans, he returned to life, journeyed to the Island of Creation, and killed the Sisters of Fate. With the Power of Time itself at his command, Kratos returned to the moment when Zeus tried to stab him with the Blade of Olympus, emerging from a portal and knocking the off-guard God King to the ground. Surprised at this development, Zeus presumed that the Sisters of Fate had unexpectedly aided him. Kratos, pulling the Blade of Olympus from his past self, told Zeus that the Sisters were dead. The King of Olympus declared that he had underestimated Kratos but will not make the same mistake again and the two combatants charged towards one another, taking to the skies as they fought. They ended up on the Summit of Sacrifice, where an epic battle began. Kratos fought Zeus furiously and managed to deliver several powerful blows, as he stated he would kill Zeus for his actions. Enraged at his defiance, Zeus unleashed his full might on the vengeful warrior in the form of a deadly electrical storm. Unable to overpower the furious god, Kratos resorted to military tactics, a feigned surrender that Kratos knew would immediately stop the onslaught. Kneeling in front of the Blade of Olympus he asked Zeus to end his life and release him from his torment. Granting what he thought was Kratos' final request, Zeus agreed to release him from his life, but insisted that his torment was just beginning. The Great God was tricked, however, and the Spartan, using the Golden Fleece to deflect a small remainder of Zeus' lighting, overpowered and took the Blade from Zeus, pinning both of his arms to a rock and began to impale Zeus with the Blade of Olympus, intending to kill him the same way he did to him until Athena intervened. Zeus took this opportunity to free himself, warning the Spartan that he had started a war he had no hope of winning. Zeus then attempted to flee, but Kratos immediately pushed Athena aside taking the Blade to make one more attempt on the severely weakened Zeus. However, Athena jumped in the way at the last second, sacrificing herself to save her father who took the moment to flee. Kratos was far more affected by Athena's death than Zeus, who coldly ignored her and narrowly escaped back to Mount Olympus though he did express concern for her later. Just before she died, Athena told Kratos that he was compelled to kill Zeus just as Zeus did to Cronos, for Kratos was Zeus' son. This was the cycle Zeus had mentioned when he killed Kratos before. Declaring that no son should ever destroy his own father (ignoring the fact that Zeus had already done the same to his own father), Athena told Kratos that Zeus must live so that Olympus would prevail. God after God would deny Kratos his vengeance, for they would protect Zeus for the sake of Olympus. Watching the fallen Athena disintegrate, Kratos felt betrayed yet again and, using the Loom Chamber, he returned to the first Great War urging the Titans to accompany him back to his own time, where a wounded Zeus had fled back to Mount Olympus.The Second Great War  After the events of God of War II, Zeus returned to Olympus and told Poseidon, Hades, Hermes, and Helios about Kratos' intentions, telling them that they have to unite once more to preserve Olympus. When they saw the Titans ascending the mountain, the Gods immediately took action, while Zeus remained out of the front lines, likely still weak after his encounter with Kratos. After witnessing the death of his brother, Poseidon, the King of the Gods decided to join the battle, with his Aegis being armed. As Kratos\u00a0and Gaia reached the platform where Zeus was waiting for them, the Spartan approached the King of the Gods, telling his father that he could no longer hide behind Athena for safety. Zeus then chided his son by insisting that it was his blind rage that caused Athena's death, asking the Spartan how far he was willing to go to have his revenge. The Ghost of Sparta replied by listing his previous battles before stating that nothing would stand in his way and that he would stop have his revenge. Infuriated with Kratos' defiance, The King of the Gods then decided to strike both Kratos and Gaia with his thunderbolts, thinking that they would both fall into the River Styx. Although Kratos did fall into the River Styx, he nevertheless survived and fought his way back to the top of Mount Olympus, destroying even more Gods and his son Hercules along the way. Zeus later indirectly encountered his son through one of Pandora's Statues, warning him to stay away from Pandora. He would not encounter Kratos in person again until he raised the Labyrinth, thereby destroying much of the inner sanctum of Mount Olympus. He attempted to stop Pandora from entering The Flame of Olympus while disparaging Kratos both for his obsession with Pandora and all of the destruction he has caused. They soon engaged in another fight, destroying more of Olympus' inner chambers. Their battle was interrupted when Pandora made another attempt to jump into the Flame. Kratos managed to grab her, but Pandora insisted to Kratos that he needed to let her go. Zeus, however, warned that he must not let her into the Flame, telling the Spartan that for once in his \"pathetic life\" he cannot fail like he failed in protecting his family. This inadvertently caused Kratos to let go of Pandora and attack Zeus in blind fury. With the Flame gone, Kratos saw and opened Pandora's Box, only to discover that it was empty. Zeus mocked his own son, stating that in spite of all his efforts, they ended in yet another \"stunning failure\", laughing his words further drove Kratos to the brink of madness. Zeus then retreated outside to the same dias that Kratos and Gaia confronted him on earlier, with Kratos following closely behind.\u00a0 The King of the Gods observes all of the destruction his son has caused to the world, telling him that he would have much to do once their battle is over. They fight each other again until they are interrupted by Gaia, who was thought to have been killed by Kratos. She returned to kill both her grandson for vengeance and her great-grandson for destroying her world, ignoring the fact that it was the death of the Olympians that caused it and that it would have happened anyway if the Titans had won. Zeus told Gaia that her pawn has failed her, and commented that she should have chosen the other one (probably referring to Deimos).\u00a0Gaia then decided to crush the platform, declaring that father and son would die together. Both of them managed to enter the large chest wound she incurred earlier from her fight with Poseidon, making their way to her heart. There the fight raged on with both using Gaia's Heart to heal themselves in the battle. Eventually, Gaia was killed when Kratos impaled Zeus against her heart with the Blade of Olympus, which apparently also killed Zeus. Gaia's body slowly broke apart and destroyed most of Mount Olympus. Regaining consciousness, Kratos retrieved the Blade of Olympus from Zeus' \"corpse\", but when he tries to leave, he is attacked by Zeus' still active spirit, which taking away all of his magic and equipment except for the Blade of Olympus, the Blades of Exile, and the Boots of Hermes, infecting him with Fear. Kratos was thought to be finished, but with the help of Pandora's spirit, Kratos managed to forgive his sins and unleash Hope\u00a0from within himself. He then briefly battled Zeus' astral form, eventually forcing it to retreat back to his body, reviving Zeus. Kratos considered of attacking him with his blades but paused and realized that Zeus was so weak he could kill him with his bare hands. He then threw his blades aside and charged at Zeus.Death  Terrified, Zeus backed away and tried to stop Kratos with his arms, but was unable to resist the Spartan's fury and was thrown against a rock. A black smoke (presumably Fear) escaped from Zeus' mouth, possibly meaning that the Fear had finally left Zeus. Kratos then begins to beat Zeus uncontrollably, kicking him in the face and throwing him against rocks, ultimately grabbing Zeus' beard and beating him to a bloody pulp. Interestingly enough, Zeus does not put up any resistance when the black smoke left his body. It is possible that he realized that by causing Kratos so much pain, he was responsible for his own demise. Zeus' body disintegrated and exploded in a huge blast of light, unleashing absolute chaos upon the world, and with this, the King of Olympus was no more, thus ending the reign of the Olympian Gods.God of War (2018)  Even many years following his death, Zeus still haunts Kratos. After Kratos defeats the Bridge Keeper of Helheim, he soon sees the image of Zeus in the sky calling to him. Kratos, surprised by the sudden arrival of his father, reveals to Mimir that he was Zeus' son. Kratos asks Mimir what that place was and how it's possible for the former King of Olympus to be there. Mimir tells Kratos to never venture there and that Helheim is known for torturing those with memories of the past with illusions. Later on in Hel, Kratos hears the past echos of Zeus speaking to him, which he ignores but would later see, along with Atreus, a ghostly reenactment of Zeus' final moments before his death, being beaten to death by Kratos. Afterwards, Kratos tells his son of how he killed his own father as Atreus realizes the specter was his grandfather. Atreus was surprised by his father's demigod status and of his past but was otherwise unfazed.Multiplayer  Zeus is one of the four mentors of God of War: Ascension's Multiplayer. His statue is the third one in the Rotunda of Olympus, staying right at the center of his brother's statues and face-to-face to any warrior who arrives at it.Overview  The king of Olympus' warriors\u00a0have the average physical powers and resistance from the game, but are the best in elemental damage. Their magic attacks, which come from the mighty lightning of Olympus, are incredibly strong, usually hitting opponents many times in deadly shocks and can disable some of their abilities for a short period when used. A warrior of Zeus must count mainly on his magic bar against his enemies. Their electric attacks can overpower warriors and beasts in seconds.Battle Mage  Impressive elemental powers.Electric Magic  Stun opponents and disable enemy magics.Zeus Items  Improve defense and escape.Zeus Weapons  Can shock enemies in electric currents or strong explosions in some special attacks.Zeus Armors  Focus on enhancing elemental powers and defenses.Personality  Zeus' benevolent side was more prevalent in the original God of War, in which he was depicted as a caring god who sought to punish evildoers and oath-breakers, even empathizing with his son Kratos' (who at that time was unaware Zeus was his father) grievances against Ares despite all of the terrible things Kratos had done. Even though he had a benevolent side, he had some negativity within him as he placed a curse on his lover (and Kratos' mother) Callisto to transform into a grotesque monster should she ever reveal his relation to Kratos or Deimos, he also feared Deimos to the point of imprisoning and torturing him for eternity due to The Marked Warrior prophecy. After Kratos opened Pandora's box, he was possessed by one of the evils in the box: fear. This transformed Zeus into a cruel, wrathful, paranoid, and power-hungry deity, as evidenced by how he started treating the innocent Pandora with cruelty. The evils of the box also caused Zeus to develop an intense fear of Kratos, whom he now realized was the \"Marked Warrior\" foretold in the Oracle's prophecy that would perpetuate the cycle of patricide which led to Zeus overthrowing his own father Cronos. Witnessing his ruthless murder of the Furies along with Ares, Thanatos, and Persephone, Zeus' fears were further exacerbated by Kratos' intense hatred for the other gods of Olympus (with Hephaestus, Athena, and Aphrodite being the only obvious exceptions) and his destructive rampages across Greece during his reign as God of War. In response, Zeus took the form of an eagle and siphoned off a large portion of Kratos' godhood powers, infusing them into the Colossus of Rhodes. He then tricked Kratos into transferring the rest of his powers into the Blade of Olympus, weakening him to the point of near-death before finishing him off for good. To prevent his followers from helping their fallen god and to punish Kratos even more, Zeus destroyed Sparta, killing hundreds of innocent people in the process. Not even his own family were safe, as he used them as mere pawns in his war against Kratos and the Titans, mourning little (if at all) about the losses of Athena (who tried to protect him, giving him a chance to escape Kratos' wrath the first time), Poseidon, Hades, Helios, Hermes, Hercules, possibly Hephaestus (even though he brutally beat him to a pulp on learning of his deception after being infected), and Hera, his wife. But when the evils that possessed him left his body, he somehow let himself get beaten by his son, implying that he finally realized that his persecution and fear of Kratos created a self-fulling prophecy. He was also unfaithful to Hera, having\u00a0cheated on his wife countless times and fathering many bastard children (including Kratos, Hercules and Deimos). He seemed to care very little about the well being of his\u00a0own children, going as far as to dispose of his own sons Hephaestus and Kratos, caring very little to not at all for Ares' (whose destructive behaviour feared him) death and imprisoning\u00a0Deimos out of fear of being dethroned.Appearance  Zeus appears as an old muscular white-haired man. His eyes are pure white, best seen in the cutscene in God of War II in which he kills Kratos. In his neutral, unaltered form he appears to stand well over 7 feet when compared to the already especially tall Kratos. In God of War II and in the opening scene of God of War III he wears white toga and golden arm guards, but after the start of the Second Titanomachy he replaces his toga with a golden side guard, possibly the Aegis of Zeus, that had similar powers to the Golden Fleece.Powers & Abilities  As the King of Olympus, Zeus is the most powerful of all the Olympians, more so than even his brothers\u00a0Poseidon and Hades. His power is great enough to challenge Kratos to a greater degree than any other God.Gallery  See Zeus/GalleryVideos  Part 1Part 2Trivia Related Pages Kratos' Weapons  The following are Kratos' weapons used throughout the series.Aphrodite  Aphrodite is the Olympian Goddess of Love and Beauty, and one of the many supporting characters in the God of War series.Greek Mythology  In Greek mythology, Aphrodite is the goddess of Love, Beauty, Seduction, Pleasure, and Happiness. There is more than one story about her origins. According to Hesiod's Theogony, she was born when Cronus cut off Uranus's genitals and threw them into the sea, and she arose from the sea foam (aphros). According to Homer's Iliad, she is the daughter of Zeus and Dione. Because of her beauty, other gods feared that their rivalry over her would interrupt the peace among them and lead to war, so Zeus married her to Hephaestus, who, because of his ugliness and deformity, was not seen as a threat. Aphrodite had many lovers - both gods, such as Ares, and men, such as Anchises. One day, the sun god Helios caught Ares and Aphrodite in their affair. When he told Hephaestus, the smith god decided to plan his revenge. He created an invisible net, which he set over the marriage bed. No sooner had Hephaestus left their home, that Aphrodite called her lover and Ares snuck into the house and in bed with the naked goddess; but, just in the midst of their lovemaking, the net fell upon the two lovers, trapping and immobilizing them, locked in a very private embrace. Hephaestus immediately walked back to his bedchamber with a host of other gods and exhibited them as they were naked and wrapped in each other's arms. Her Roman equivalent is Venus.In the God of War Series God of War  Aphrodite appeared in the first game in the city of Athens, presenting one of the tasks Kratos must pass: killing Medusa by decapitating her, and using her gaze as a weapon. Once the task is complete Kratos must then use the gaze to turn a few minotaurs into stone. She then allows Kratos to pass and continue his quest.God of War III  Aphrodite was seen in bed, with her handmaidens, but when she sees Kratos, she tells them to leave. She attempts to seduce Kratos, telling him, \"Even though you are no longer the God of War, you can still share my bed.\" But Kratos was not amused. Annoyed, she reveals how she yearns for a \"real man\" to meet her, but since Zeus refused to let the imprisoned Daedalus finish the bridge, she has not had her wish granted and she expressed how much she dislikes Hephaestus. That's when she realizes that Kratos needs those bridges fixed and tells him that she might give him information only if Kratos pleases her (he must have sex with her). If he does, Kratos would be given Red Orbs. While having sex with her, the handmaidens say Kratos has \"such power\" and later they begin making love, as well. Aphrodite wanted Kratos to have sex with her again, but an impatient Kratos refused. Irritated, Aphrodite tells Kratos to go to Hephaestus for help instead. It is unknown if Aphrodite or her handmaidens were able to escape the palace when Gaia's giant corpse destroyed all of Olympus.Powers and Abilities  As the Goddess of Love, Aphrodite possessed many powers.Personality  She seems to have a very carefree, yet promiscuous outlook on life. In fact, the only thing she cares about is having sex, and is actively neutral in the war Kratos is waging against the gods. This promiscuous nature seems more to do with the fact that she is the Goddess of Love, Beauty, Sexuality and Procreation, than it does with the opening of Pandora's Box. But after it was opened, the evils Lust/Vanity completely took possession of her which made the already sex loving goddess even more promiscuous than ever indeed. She loves making love rather than do anything else. Her only benchmark, it seems, for having intercourse with someone is whether or not she finds the man attractive enough to sleep with her. It is implied by her handmaidens that she is difficult to fully please sexually, due to her having so much experience in the matter (it's also most likely that she prefers having sexual intercourse with men, but since the bridges were nearly destroyed the only way to please her were her handmaidens). She was surprised when Kratos is able to nearly make her lose her composure with his own experience.Appearance  Aphrodite is considered to be flawlessly beautiful. She has long, auburn hair kept in a braid and pale blue eyes. Though she has in this new lifetime hazel brown eyes, hiding the pale blue that truly is her eye-color. Her body can be considered \"perfect\" since she is the Goddess of Love, Beauty, and Sexuality. She wears a revealing dress that exposes her perfectly sized and formed breasts (most likely to sexually appeal to mortals) and is barefoot.Trivia Hades  Hades was the Olympian\u00a0God of the Underworld. He is\u00a0surpassed in eminence only by his brothers, Zeus and Poseidon although it is possible that Hades is considered equal to Poseidon.\u00a0He is the oldest son of the Titans Cronos and Rhea and husband of Persephone. He was also a minor supporting character in God of War and a major antagonist in God of War III  where he was eventually confronted by his nephew, who after a fierce duel, tore off the god's helmet before killing him by absorbing his soul with his own weapons.Greek Mythology  Hades was the ancient Greek god of the Underworld and the brother of Zeus, but his name was shared with the abode of the dead. In Greek Mythology, Hades was the first son and fourth child of Cronos and Rhea. According to myth, he along with his younger brothers Zeus and Poseidon defeated the Titans in battle and took over rulership of the cosmos; ruling the Underworld, Sky, and Sea, respectively; the solid earth, the long province of Gaia, was available to all three concurrently. He was also called \"Plouton\" (Greek: meaning \"Rich One\"), a name which the Romans Latinized as Pluto. The Romans would associate Hades/Pluto with their own chthonic gods, Dis Pater and Orcus. The corresponding Etruscan god was Aita and the corresponding Canaanite god was Mot. Symbols associated with him are the Helm of Darkness and the three-headed dog, Cerberus.In the God of War Series The First Titanomachy  Hades appears in cutscenes in God of War II, during the Great War, when the Gods defeated the Titans. He is seen fighting his father Cronos trying to take Cronos's soul until Atlas comes and uses a ground attack on Hades to save Cronos. This causes Hades to turn his attention to Atlas and with his brother Poseidon coming to help him Hades is able to take Atlas's soul placing it within him thus defeating the Titan leader. After the Titanomachy he becomes a prominent figure among the Gods as there is a statue of him in the Garden of the Gods along with Athena, Ares, Zeus, Helios, and Poseidon. At the end of the game he is seen with Poseidon, Helios and Hermes standing in front of Zeus, before the second Great War (when Kratos uses the Loom of Fate to rescue the Titans before they were defeated and imprisoned in the first Great War) begins.Wager of the Gods  In the comics, Hades is seen in flashbacks competing in the wager of the Gods, a contest in which Gods choose various mortals as their champions, with the goal being the capture of the healing elixir known as Ambrosia. Hades chose Alrik, a warrior who sought to capture the Ambrosia in order to save his ill father, as his champion. After which, in fear that Kratos may best his champion, Hades sent a torrent of great fires from the sky onto Kratos' army. He was still able to kill Kratos. After Alrik was defeated by Kratos and torn apart by Rocs, Hades revived him and sent him to destroy the Spartan who defied him. After being saved from death, Alrik then discovered that his beloved father had died, and so, the new Barbarian King vowed to exact vengeance on Kratos.Kratos' Tiring of Ares  In God of War: Ascension, Ares, the God of War, sent The Furies to capture Kratos and imprison him in a Titan-sized prison for the living damned, where he is tortured for months on end, driven insane, and constantly haunted by the visions of the night he lost everything dear to him. Fueled by a desire for revenge against Ares, along with a need to redeem himself among Hades to earn salvation, Kratos manages to break free of his imprisonment and sets out on a journey to kill the Furies. If he can successfully defeat them he can sever all ties to Ares without consequence.Persephone's Betrayal  In God of War: Chains of Olympus, one of the final challenges is called Challenge of Hades. Hades himself does not appear, although Kratos does enter his realm of the dead, the Underworld. Hades does, however, play a background role, as husband to Persephone, the main antagonist of the game. Persephone doesn't love him but is forced to remain in his dark realm. Because of this, she had chosen to end both her life and that of the Gods by freeing Atlas and commanding him to kidnap Helios, the God of the Sun, from the sky and use his power to destroy the Pillar of the World.Aiding Kratos  In God of War, he manifests in Pandora's Temple in a translucent form, like the other gods, and gives Kratos a magic called the Army of Hades. Only his fiery, demonic face is seen. There is also a giant statue of him in the section of the Temple called The Challenge of Hades, as well as another statue of Hades alongside Zeus and Poseidon in Pandora's Box's Elevator.Moving in Shadows  While Hades doesn't appear in Betrayal, he is, again, a background character. When Kratos starts chasing the mysterious Assassin, the Undead Legionnaires and Cerberus appear from Underworld to stop him. Kratos wondered why Hades sent these beasts to attack him, speculating that Hades is the one who is plotting to ruin Kratos' relationship with the other gods. This would have made sense since Hades already had a legitimate reason to hate Kratos for the death of his wife Persephone. (Note: Betrayal is not considered part of the canon.)The Second Titanomachy  Hades is first seen amongst the congregation of Gods on Mount Olympus, dropping down to join Hermes and Helios in the battle against the Titans saved and led by Kratos scaling the mountain. He is briefly seen dislodging his uncle Oceanus from the mountain after Kratos disabled one of the Leviathans attacking Gaia. Kratos encounters Hades personally in the Underworld, who seeks to prevent him from escaping again. After first entering, Hades periodically comments Kratos' actions, often in a sarcastic, humorous or taunting tone of voice. As soon as Kratos enters his Palace, Hades takes a more hostile stand, claiming he senses \"some bad blood\" between them. Before the battle, Hades reminds Kratos how he has wronged him in the past, by killing Athena\u00a0(his niece), by killing Poseidon\u00a0(his brother), and especially Persephone, his wife and \"Beautiful Queen\". Hades then threatens, \"I will see you suffer as I have suffered! Your soul is mine!\". Emerging from the darkness, Hades immediately attempts to steal Kratos' soul but fails. An intense battle ensues, during which Kratos and Hades do battle with their respective chain blades. Eventually, the blades become entangled, and Hades attempted to pull Kratos into the River Styx. Eventually, Kratos gains the upper hand and uses both weapons to form a noose around Hades' neck, repeatedly slamming his uncle's head into the ceiling and knocking him into the River Styx seemingly killing him. From this, Kratos obtains the Claws of Hades allowing him to steal souls. Eventually, a significantly bigger Hades bursts out of the river using the soul to maintain him self, no longer sporting his helmet, revealing a deformed, devilish, cracked skull. After a fierce duel Kratos manages to rip out his soul, using his own Claws killing the God of the Underworld once and for all. As Hades' rule of the Underworld lifts, the tormented souls of the Styx swarm over Hades, dragging him into the depths of the river. Kratos, in possession of Hades' soul, is now free to traverse the River Styx unharmed. After diving into the river, the godly possession, Hades' helmet, can be retrieved at the bottom, near the point of entry. It then becomes available during Bonus Play. Before leaving, Hades' corpse can be seen at the bottom of the Styx, mutilated, as the tormented souls tore a passage through his gut to escape the river. Swimming through Hades' now open torso, Kratos follows them and returns to The Forge of Hephaestus, the Blacksmith God. Hephaestus asks how Kratos could be alive and if \"Lord Hades\" rules no longer, to which Kratos responds, \"The God of the Underworld is dead!\" Hephaestus is shocked by this and states that he thought that the death of Hades was impossible, to which Kratos responds, \"Olympians overestimate themselves.\" Hephaestus replied, \"I will keep that in mind, Spartan\".Multiplayer  Hades is one of the four god mentors of God of War: Ascension's Multiplayer. His statue is the second one in the Rotunda of Olympus.Overview  Warriors\u00a0aligned to Hades have great physical powers (being rivaled only by warriors of Ares)\u00a0and\u00a0increased cooldown reduction, too, but lack defenses (again, only being less weak than Ares). But these are not their best advantages: being considered the best Multiplayer allegiance many times, the secret of these warriors is their ability to steal health from enemies and specialty in escape and stealth techniques. A particular item offered by the Underworld God is Hades' Helmet, which allows players to stay invisible from other players for some time. Warriors of Hades are literally the living nightmare to anyone from the opponent team when fighting seriously, and must focus on using surprise attacks in order to have an advantage in battle. Before taking strong blows, they can use their items to perform effective escapes and when injured, they can also use their magic to drain nearby enemies' vitality.Assassin  Stealth abilities.Soul Magic  Drains vitality from opponents.Hades Items  Reduce cooldown and increase mobility.Hades Weapons  Can drain health from enemies and perform surprise attacks in certain special attacks.Hades Armors  Focus on increasing cooldown reduction.Powers and Abilities  As the ruler of the Underworld and everything that resides within it, Hades is both the oldest of his siblings and one of the most powerful of the Olympian Gods surpassed only by his brothers Zeus and Poseidon. Hades is naturally a force to be reckoned with by any being who is foolish enough to anger him. His will alone is the absolute authority in both the gloomy realm itself as well as all other areas that are under his control; Nothing happens in the realm without his knowledge of it.Personality  Unlike his brother Zeus and many of the other Gods of the series, Hades is mostly unconcerned with the affairs of the mortal realm, preferring to focus his energies on the Underworld. He is, however, quick to anger if someone crosses him or his family, which makes him an enemy of Kratos. As Kratos is traveling through his palace, Hades comments that there is bad blood between them, as Kratos had murdered his niece (Athena) and his brother (Poseidon). He also appeared to have deeply cared for Persephone, despite her words and treachery. Indeed, he has restored her remains and created a massive memorial to her. He doesn't comment on the loss of his nephew Ares, indicating that Hades, much like the other gods, did not care much for Ares. This means that, unlike most of the other Gods, Hades cared for his family. Hades had a sinister, sadistic, mock-playful humor, evident in the way he taunts and intimidates Kratos throughout the Underworld. This is similar to the mythological Hades, who often gave out ironic punishments to particularly unfortunate souls. He also appears to be a masochist, as even when Kratos beats him senseless and tears away chunks of flesh, he claims to enjoy the pain. Like most Olympians, he has no respect for the mortals he has shown in the wager of the gods. He sent a plague to Alrik's father to force him to compete in the wager just for his own amusement and when he lost he convinced Alrik to seek revenge on Kratos, unintentionally setting in motion the events of the series.Gifts and Objects Trivia Related Pages Titans  The Titans were the race of deities who ruled the world before the Olympian Gods came to existence. They were the ones who aided Kratos in his quest for vengeance against Zeus but they became the secondary group of antagonists upon Gaia's betrayal.Greek Mythology  In Greek mythology, the Titans (\u03a4\u03b9\u03c4\u03ac\u03bd) were a race of extremely powerful and physically huge deities that ruled the world during the legendary Golden Age of Mankind. They were the children of Gaia and Ouranos. There were 12 original Titans, the males being known as the Titans (Oceanus, Coeus, Kreios, Hyperion, Iapetus, and Cronos) and the females as the Titanides (Rhea, Theia/Thera, Phoebe, Mnemosyne, Themis and Tethys). They were ruled by the youngest Titan, Cronos, who overthrew Ouranos\u00a0with the aid of Gaia (who crafted his sickle) and his brothers (not Oceanus) and Typhon, Titan God of Wind Storm and son of Tartarus and Gaia. Later, several of the Titans also produced offspring which were also Titans. These Titans included the children of Oceanus (the Potamoi and Oceanids), the children of Coeus (the Coeides: Leto, Asteria and Lelantos), the children of Kreios (the Creionides: Astraeus, Pallas and Perses) , the children of Hyperion (the Hyperionides: Helios, Eos and Selene), the children of Iapetus (the Iapetionides:\u00a0Atlas, Menoetius, Prometheus,\u00a0and\u00a0Epimetheus). The Titans preceded the Olympian Gods\u00a0who, led by Zeus, eventually overthrew them in the Titanomachy. The Titans were then imprisoned in Tartarus, the deepest and darkest pit\u00a0of the Underworld. Only a few Titans (such as Prometheus, Oceanus) were spared that fate. Atlas, who led the Titans in the Titanomachy, was forced to hold the sky (Ouranos) upon his shoulders, fore the sky was greatly damaged in the war and couldn't support itself and also because of the death of the sky (Ouranus).In the God of War Series Birth and Fate  In the beginning, there was darkness. The Titans were born on the\u00a0Island of Creation, home to the\u00a0Sisters of Fate\u00a0and controllers of time. Themis was born of Gaia, who became the embodiment of divine order, law, and custom, giving the Titans a purpose to be a part of the world. The rest of the world was created by the Titans and Cronos was given the title as ruler. However, it was prophesized that one day Cronos would be overthrown by his very children, just as Uranus had been years before. In an attempt to sway the Sisters into his favor, Cronos gifted them with the\u00a0Steeds of Time. The Sisters refused to change his fate and the fate that would also haunt the Titans forever. Cronos began devouring his children one by one so that the prophecy may not come true. His wife,\u00a0Rhea, could not bear another such loss and hid the sixth and final child on an island far away from the watchful eyes of her husband. Cronos foolishly swallowed a rock wrapped in cloth in the baby's place. The child who escaped his siblings\u2019 fate was Zeus, who was raised by his grandmother Gaia herself to nurture his desire to free his brothers and sisters from their prison. When the day came and\u00a0Zeus\u00a0had become a young man, he freed his siblings from their cruel father and the\u00a0Great War\u00a0began.The Great War  The Titans believed that they had to win or the Gods would make the mortals suffer, caring only for control and power. The Titans Prometheus\u00a0and\u00a0Helios (In the mythology Epimetheus also joined the Olympians, which isn't the case in the game) joined the Gods in the battle against the Titans, betraying their very own. The Titans were led by the great Atlas, who saved Cronos, the latter was about to have his soul consumed by the hands of\u00a0Hades, by hurtling rocks and causing earthquakes toward the God. In Cronos' place Atlas was captured by Hades with the help of Poseidon, but the battle continued. Mountains were hurled like mere pebbles, and the ground shook from massive earthquakes. The war between the Titans and the Gods forged the landscape of the mortal world. Eventually, Zeus created the Blade of Olympus, and used its immense magical power to send the Titans to the foulest pits of the Underworld \u2013 Tartarus. This ended the Great War, and the gods established their domain upon Mount Olympus, being worshiped by the mortals who begged for their mercy and guidance. The Golden Age had indeed ended.  In Tartarus, the Titans would be tortured or trapped for all eternity (despite Cronos being\u00a0the one\u00a0who caused the\u00a0great war) with the Gauntlet of Zeus being created to chain and bind them. One of the Titans chained to the walls of Tartarus with this method that Kratos encounters was Hyperion. Cronos\u00a0suffered the fate of wandering the Desert of Lost Souls with Pandora's Temple chained to his back until the strength of the whirling winds and sands ripped his flesh from his bones. Aegaeon was transformed into a living prison for oathbreakers by the Furies for breaking his oath to Zeus to fight alongside the Gods with the other Hecatonchires. The Titan Typhon was imprisoned within an enormous mountain. On the same mountain as Prometheus, because of betraying Zeus and giving the mortals the fires of Olympus, was forced to endure the pain of having his liver eaten everyday by a large eagle only to suffer the fate again and again. The great Titan Atlas was to hold the world of the living on his shoulders, his hands chained to the earth though Kratos broke one of the chains, releasing him from some of the pain.Kratos' Encounter With Cronos  Athena instructed Kratos to journey to the Desert of Lost Souls where the Titan Cronos crawled with Pandora\u2019s Temple upon his back. The Titan showed no notice of him as Kratos climbed a mountain leading to the temple for three days, while Cronos was still crawling pitifully across the harsh desert wasteland with the wind blowing in his face. The mighty Titan walked\u00a0in the\u00a0desert for millennia until Kratos retrieved Pandora's Box. They would later meet at the Steeds of Time (A holograph of Cronos). The Titan was later sent to Tartarus with the temple chained to his back.The Prisoner of Atlantis  Within the volcanic mountain outside of Atlantis, the lava titan,\u00a0Thera, was imprisoned and she appears to be the core of the volcanic activity. There, Kratos was informed by her that his arrival was foretold by Gaia and pleaded to be released or they would both remain prisoners of their own torments. Kratos hurled his blades into Thera's chest, thus receiving the power of Thera's Bane and setting Thera free, who then started tearing down her chains as the spartan left the chamber, leaving destruction in her wake. As the volcano erupted, she was seen rising out of her captivity in the distance, though what became of Thera remains unknown. It's likely that Thera, along with the other Titans, joined Kratos in his assault against the gods and was killed during the battle.Alliance with Kratos  Kratos was saved by Gaia's guidance while he was being taken to the Underworld. She told Kratos that Zeus would have to be destroyed in order for there to be any hope for Kratos. With her voice whispering into Kratos' ear, the powerful warrior traveled to the mountain where Typhon and Prometheus rested. Typhon, bound to his mountainous prison, refused to help the former Olympian. Typhon tried blowing Kratos off of the cliffs where he walked, hoping he would fall to his death. Kratos managed to obtain Typhon's Bane by stabbing Typhon's eye, blinding him. Kratos also released Prometheus from his torment by burning him to death in a fiery pit, granting him the power of the Rage of the Titans. Cronos gifted Kratos with the last of his magic while traveling with the Steeds of Time. This magic was known as Cronos' Rage. Kratos also fell into the grasp of the mighty Titan Atlas, who gifted him with the knowledge of the Great War and the powerful Atlas Quake. With all of his powers and gifts, Kratos defeated the Sisters of Fate and traveled back in time to the final minutes of the Great War. He saved the Titans from being banished and brought them into his time. There, he and the Titans climbed Mount Olympus to finally rid the mortals of the petty gods once and for all. The mortals were terrified, but there was nowhere to run or hide from the brutal battle.Second Titanomachy  With the Second Titanomachy having begun, the Olympians immediately leapt into battle against the Titans climbing up Mount Olympus. Helios, Hermes, Hercules, and Hades engaged the Titans head on, while Poseidon waits with Zeus. Hades in his giant form would use his Claws to pull dislodge the Titan Oceanus as he was making his way up the mountain. Poseidon then entered the fray by leaping off the top of Olympus, he targeted the Titan Epimetheus and blasted through his\u00a0chest, killing him instantly and knocking him off the mountain into the waters below. With the help of his Hippocampi, which erupted from the water, Poseidon pulled at least one more Titan off Mount Olympus before reaching Kratos and Gaia, in the form of a colossal watery construct. After a long and hard struggle, Kratos and Gaia combined their efforts, managing to kill the God of the Sea, with the Spartan gouging his eyes and snapping his neck. Victorious from their battle with Poseidon, Kratos and Gaia reached Zeus, who then summoned a lightning bolt to blast them off the mountain, resulting in Kratos falling into the Underworld, though not before learning that he was just a pawn for Gaia which made the Titans his new enemies along with the Gods. After killing Hades and escaping the Underworld, Kratos happened upon a wounded Gaia who praised the Spartan for surviving his fall, stating \"The blood of Cronos serves you well\". She then pleaded with him for help but he cuts the vines of Gaia's damaged hand. When she pleads to him by asking if she meant anything to him, Kratos responded in a form of cruel irony that Gaia was his pawn as she stated she must face Zeus so the Titans may have their vengeance on the Gods. However, Kratos stated the war against the gods was his war not hers. For her earlier betrayal, he uses the Blade of Olympus and cuts the remaining vine to her hand causing her to fall off the mountain to her supposed demise. Later in the war-torn city of Olympia, Helios was still engaged in combat with the Titan Perses when Kratos reached the site of the battle. With the help of a Ballista, Kratos knocked Helios and his chariot into the grasp of Perses, who crushed and tossed the Sun God across the city. Perses then proceeded to rampage throughout the city while Kratos continued onward with his own agenda and decapitated the Sun God with his bare hands. Once he made his way through an Icarus Vent, Kratos came across Perses again, who tried to kill him, as possible retribution for what Kratos had done to Gaia. Kratos managed to shun the attack of the Titan, then pulled out the Blade of Olympus and impaled Perses' left eye before causing an explosion, blasting the Titan's face. Perses fell off the mountain once again, only this time, it seemed very unlikely he would have survived the fall as he is never seen again. When sent by Hephaestus on a suicide mission to find the Omphalos Stone in Tartarus, Kratos stumbled onto the fallen hand of Gaia before encountering his grandfather: Cronos. Enraged at his very presence and for supposedly killing Gaia, Cronos made an attempt to kill his grandson, losing a few finger nails to Kratos in the process. After battling against the massive Titan, Cronos managed to swallow Kratos, which proved to be a fatal mistake as the Spartan proceeded to cut his way out using the Blade of Olympus, spilling Cronos' intestines in the process. Kratos then proceeded to kill Cronos with the Blade of Olympus before returning to Hephaestus with the Omphalos Stone to craft the Nemesis Whip. During the final battle between him and Zeus, Kratos encountered Gaia, who managed to mostly regrow her lost hand to climb back up the mountain, one last time when she interrupted the fight between father and son. Declaring that \"the reign of Olympus ends here\" upon her return, Gaia then expresses anger towards Kratos and the Gods as her world \"bleeds\" because of them. Revealing that she never sought Kratos' death, Gaia proclaims that the Spartan has left her no other choice; Zeus took this moment to comment that Kratos has failed her and that she should have chosen the other one instead. Angered by this defiance, Gaia simply replied that \"father and son will die together\" and crushed the Shrine of Olympus in her hands. Zeus and Kratos leapt into a large gaping wound in her chest caused earlier by Poseidon's Hippocampi and found their way to her heart, where Kratos proceeded to shatter its defenses, and drew energy from the Titan, causing her immense pain. The battle resumed when Zeus made his appearance and continued until Kratos stabbed Zeus with the Blade of Olympus and ran him through Gaia's heart, killing her as her body dissolving collapsed onto Olympus, leaving only large chunks of earth, and some withered trees and branches behind. With the deaths of all the other Titans, the only remaining Titan is possibly Atlas as he is left holding the world on his shoulders at Pillar of the World,\u00a0Typhon's fate is largely unknown.Appearance Physical  The Titans are as large as mountains and appear to be mostly elemental. Though they are evidently not very physically beautiful in any way with few exceptions, they possess immense physical strength and stamina. The Olympians appear more civilized and human than the Titans, whereas the Titans appear more ancient, earthly, and elemental. However, this is not applied to all Titans, as Rhea, Prometheus, Eos and Helios look more human, and share the human's common figure and overall height and appearance (though the latter two were Titans that helped the Olympians and may have transformed to their current appearance).\u00a0In-Game  There are numerous Titans who make various appearances throughout the entire God of War series. These are a few:Powers  The main powers that all Titans possessed are superhuman strength, superhuman stamina, superhuman durability,\u00a0immortality and regenerative abilities. Some of the Titans may also possess some form of energy projection and the power to control and manipulate the elements which they embody. Oceanus and Perses seem to be covered in their respective elements, Oceanus being covered in Water and Lightning, and Perses is covered in Lava implying that they both could manipulate those elements. Gaia could also possess the power over Earth and possibly over the life on it. They seem to possess shape-shifting ability, since the Titans Rhea, Helios, Prometheus and Eos fully resemble human beings in size, height and beauty. Given that their fellow Titans didn't look appealing at all, so it can be assumed that they prefer a more attractive human form, and assume their appearance. However, it is unknown what powers Rhea, mother of the six original Olympians, possesses, as she hasn't displayed her own powers in the series, as well as her current status and location being unknown, though it is likely she is deceased or living somewhere far away. They also seem to have awareness over the events that happen in the corresponding element that they embody in the world. For example, Gaia saw all the events that happened to Kratos and was able to talk to him despite not being present at the time. The same happens with other Titans like Prometheus and Typhon, who had some knowledge about Kratos eventhough they were both isolated in a mountain.Cronos  Cronos (also spelled Cronus\u00a0or Kronos), was the leader and last of the mighty Titans who were born to Gaia and Ouranos. He fathered the first of the Olympians with his wife Rhea. He fought in the Titanomachy where he was overthrown by his son Zeus. His punishment by Zeus after the battle was to forever carry Pandora's Temple on his back in chains. He is a minor character in God of War, a minor ally in God of War II and a major antagonist in God of War III.Greek Mythology  In Greek mythology, Cronos was the last of Gaia and Ouranos' children and was the Emperor of the Titans. During the reign of Ouranos, the hundred armed Hecatonchires and one-eyed Cyclops were imprisoned within Tartarus, causing Gaia great pain.\u00a0Gaia constructed a sickle and ordered her children to use it against Ouranos, but they refused. Only Cronos was brave enough to take the weapon. When Ouranos met with Gaia, Cronos ambushed his father Ouranos and castrated him with the sickle; from the blood sprouted the Gigantes, The Furies, and Aphrodite. After defeating Ouranos, Cronos reimprisoned the Hecatonchires and the Cyclops along with the Gigantes and set the dragon Campe to guard them forever.\u00a0He and his sister-wife, Rhea, took the throne of the world as Emperor and Empress, respectively. This period of Cronos' rule was called the \"Golden Age,\" as the people of the time had no need for laws or rules; everyone did the right thing, and evil was absent. Cronos learned from the Sisters of Fate that he was destined to be overcome by his own son, just as he had overthrown his father.\u00a0As a result, although he sired the gods Demeter, Hera, Hades, Hestia, and Poseidon by Rhea, he swallowed them all as soon as they were born to prevent the prophecy from happening.\u00a0The sixth and final child, Zeus, would become the son destined to overthrow Cronos and defeat the Titans. Cronos was usually depicted with a sickle, which is used to harvest crops and also the weapon used to defeat Ouranos. Other children he is reputed to have fathered was Chiron, by Philyra. His counterpart in Roman mythology is Saturn and his Canaanite counterpart is El.In the God of War Series Birth and Early Days  In the beginning, the mighty Titans were sired by the union of Ouranos and Gaia. They were all born on the Island of Creation, home to the Sisters of Fate.\u00a0Above any other beings, including the Titans, the Sisters of Fate could see the future and predict what would happen to any living being.\u00a0The Titans feared the Sisters of Fate for this\u00a0and left the Island of Creation to rule the mortal world. This marked the beginning of the Golden Age of Mankind. Cronos, the mighty ruler of the Titans, was prophesized to be overthrown by his own children in the future. To prevent this from coming true, Cronos tried to bribe the Sisters of Fate into changing his destiny by granting them the Steeds of Time. However, this gift would not prevent the prophecy from coming true. In a second attempt to prevent this from happening, his wife, Rhea, bore his children and one by one he swallowed them whole, imprisoning them within his belly. Rhea could not bear another loss, for she already had five children taken from her. When the sixth child was born, Rhea called upon an eagle to take the baby far away from the watchful eyes of Cronos. In the baby's place, Rhea wrapped a stone in cloth and offered it to Cronos, who foolishly believed it to be the baby and swallowed it whole.Great War  The mighty Titan Atlas was the military leader of the Titans in their epic battle against the Gods. Mountains were hurled like pebbles and tremendous earthquakes shook the world. Cronos had almost been defeated by having his soul taken by his son Hades, but was saved by Atlas, who was defeated by Hades and Poseidon. After Zeus created the Blade of Olympus a powerful weapon, the Titans were banished to the darkest pits of Tartarus to endure great suffering for all time, but Cronos would be granted another great fate in time.Zeus' Punishment  Not wanting to store Pandora's Box in the Flame of Olympus, which would require the sacrifice of Pandora to retrieve anything stored within the flame, Hephaestus lied to Zeus saying storing it on Cronos' back would be a much safer place since defeating Cronos is no easy task. Believing Hephaestus, Zeus, Hades, and Poseidon ordered Pathos Verdes III to construct Pandora's Temple on top of Cronos, by chaining him down and constructing it on top of him. He was then forced to wander the Desert of Lost Souls with Pandora's Temple chained to his back forever.\u00a0As suggested by Hephaestus, it was hinted Cronos was supposed to kill anyone who tried to obtain Pandora's Box, but it is implied he defied this order and allowed anyone to attempt to use Pandora's Box to destroy Olympus. When the Titan Horn would be blown, Cronos would be called upon to allow countless warriors to endure the many dangers which lurked within the temple. Above all warriors, Kratos, the Ghost of Sparta, was responsible for completing the many feats within the temple and even retrieving Pandora's Box so he could kill Ares, the God of War, for tricking the Spartan into killing his family. Kratos was successful at retrieving Pandora's Box, but Ares sensed that Kratos had the Box and hurled a pole at the Spartan, killing him. Ares then had his Harpies take Kratos to the Underworld and bring the Box to him. After Ares was killed and Kratos became the new God of War, Zeus became consumed with fear and banished Cronos to the pits of Tartarus so that the Titan is tormented for all eternity. That happened because Zeus blamed Cronos for Kratos's success on finding Pandora's Box.Encounter with Kratos  Kratos also discovered the magic Cronos had hidden within the Steeds of Time.\u00a0This magic, called Cronos' Rage, allowed Kratos to electrify his enemies much like Poseidon's Rage. Nothing else is known about the Titan other than the fact that he was responsible for destroying his own father, starting a vicious cycle. This cycle was between fathers being destroyed by their sons, much like Kratos tried to do when he fought Zeus upon the Summit of Sacrifice.Battling Kratos  After Hephaestus, The Olympian Blacksmith God, \"allies\" himself with Kratos against Zeus he tasks the Spartan with retrieving the Omphalos Stone from Cronos' stomach, with which he can fashion a weapon for Kratos that \"will give you the retribution you so rightly deserve.\" When Kratos enters Tartarus, he comes across Gaia's fallen hand before Cronos appears holding Kratos responsible for Gaia's death. The Titan revealed that after Kratos used Pandora's Box to kill Ares, Zeus became consumed with fear and banished Cronos to the Pits of Tartarus so that the Titan would be tormented for all eternity. He blames the Spartan for his torment. Kratos defends that he was tasked by the Gods to kill Ares; Cronos retorts that he did so only because of his need for vengeance but now vengeance comes to him.\u00a0 Cronos tries to squash Kratos, despite the latter claiming that he now fights against Zeus. When the Titan attempts to crush Kratos between his massive fingers, Kratos uses Solar Flare to blind him.\u00a0Cronos still tries to squash him, but Kratos manages to maneuver his way around Cronos' body, tearing one of Cronos' fingernails off. Cronos eventually catches up with Kratos, and swallows him whole.Death  After being swallowed by Cronos, and falling down his throat to his stomach, Kratos located the Omphalos Stone, before he used the Blade of Olympus to slice his way out, causing him intense pain and spilling out his intestines. Cronos desperately tries to cover his wound while Kratos emerges from his stomach with the item.\u00a0Cronos then pleads for his life, saying that since Kratos had what he came for he should just leave Cronos be. Ignoring the Titan's pleas, Kratos climbed up Cronos' chest, and shattered a piece of Cronos' shackles, which impaled him through the jaw, causing him extreme pain. Cronos desperately attempted to remove his chains from his jaw, before being left immobile cursing his situation.\u00a0Kratos then walked over Cronos's face and prepared to stab him in the head with the Blade of Olympus. In one final act of defiance, Cronos cursed Kratos stating \"I should have expected this from a coward such as yourself! A coward who kills his own kin!\" Kratos indeed killed his grandfather, Cronos, and sought to kill his father, Zeus. However, Cronos had turned on his own offspring centuries before by imprisoning them in his stomach, making his condemnation rather hypocritical. The Spartan ignored him and stabs his forehead, lethally wounding him. Cronos then slowly collapsed and died.Personality  Cronos, much like his son Zeus, was very power hungry and paranoid, as he destroyed his father Ouranos, only so he could replace him as the new ruler of the universe, but became deeply afraid of his own children, fearing that one of them would overthrow him, swallowing any of his children moments after they were ever born. However, he seems to care for his titan brethren, unlike his son Zeus, who hardly cared for any Olympian, (though only after being infected by the evils) as he was ready to kill Kratos for supposedly killing his mother Gaia. After being defeated during the Great War, forced to carry Pandora's temple on his back and then imprisoned in Tartarus to suffer for all eternity, Cronos became extremely enraged, feeling a deep hatred for Kratos, blaming him for Zeus's wrath and Gaia's supposed death, refusing to even listen to Kratos' reasons. Unlike other foes, he doesn't underestimate Kratos since he knew the Spartan could defeat a Titan by himself. When overpowered by Kratos, he begged the latter to spare him since they were family but when that was ignored he (ironically and defiantly) called him a coward who slaughters his own.Powers and Abilities  Cronos possessed extreme strength and stamina, which can be attributed to his massive size. As King of the Titans, he is the biggest and most powerful, and his strength, durability, stamina and resilience is arguably almost as great if not completely matched with Atlas. Like Atlas, he was able to show a great deal of resilience against the Claws of Hades as he was able to hold on to his soul for a great amount of time. He was also the only Titan brave enough to stand up to his father Ouranos, dismember him, and become the new ruler of the world. Cronos gave his remaining powers to Kratos on the Steeds of Time, which aided him in his quest to seek the Sisters of Fate. Cronos' powers showed similar capabilities to that of his sons Zeus and Poseidon, being that he could control lightning and thunder.\u00a0 Cronos was strong enough to hold the entire temple of Pandora on his back for centuries without resting, and even walking on both legs with it. Proof of his enormous stamina was the fact that he endured his punishment for a long time, and he also suffered massive wounds from Kratos that would have killed any mortal, gods and even other titans, such as having his stomach sliced and his intestines spilled, as well as having his jaw impaled, and finally surviving some seconds with the Blade of Olympus on his forehead, whereas other gods were killed almost instantly by Kratos with much less effort. Standing at 1600 feet tall, Cronos is easily the largest titan in the God of War series.Trivia Poseidon  Poseidon is the ruler of the oceans and is\u00a0surpassed in eminence only by his brother\u00a0Zeus. He is the Olympian God of the seas, rivers, water, storms, tempests, winds, hurricanes, rain, floods, drought, earthquakes and horses, King of the Ocean and of Atlantis. He appears as an ally in God of War and a major antagonist in God of War III.Greek Mythology  In Roman mythology, he was known as Neptune. Linear B tablets show that Poseidon was venerated at Pylos and Thebes in pre-Olympian Greece, but he was integrated into the Olympian gods as the younger brother of Hades and Zeus and third of all of his siblings, generally considered a little less powerful than Zeus. Poseidon and Amphitrite, a nymph and ancient sea-goddess and daughter of Oceanus, had many children including Triton, the messenger of the sea and herald to Amphitrite, Theseus, the cyclops Polyphemus, and Orion the giant master hunter. Like his youngest brother Zeus, Poseidon was known for having many human lovers. In the known Greek Mythos, he raped Medusa on the floor of one of Athena's temples. Angered by the blasphemy but unable to harm Poseidon, Athena\u00a0changed Medusa into a Gorgon. When she was later beheaded by the hero Perseus, Chryasor and Pegasus emerged.In the God of War Series Great War  Like\u00a0most of his siblings, Poseidon was swallowed by the Titan King Cronos. When he was released, he fought alongside his brother, Zeus, in the Great War of the Gods and Titans. During a great battle between the Gods and the Titans, Poseidon aided his brother Hades to bring down the mighty Atlas. After Atlas saved his uncle Cronos from having his soul captured by Hades, Atlas was electrocuted by Poseidon's thunder, bringing him to his knees. Hades reacted swiftly and with his fiery chains he\u00a0grasped onto Atlas. With Poseidon further electrocuting Atlas, Hades was able to capture the Titan's soul, making him stronger. After the Blade of Olympus was created and the Titans were banished to the Tartarus; the pit of torment, Poseidon was given dominion over all seas. He took Amphitrite as his wife and watched over the waters of Greece, being worshiped by sailors to grant safe passage in his waters.Wager of the Gods  Poseidon briefly appeared as a contender in the wager of the gods, a contest in which they would each choose one mortal to represent them. The ultimate goal was to capture the healing elixir, Ambrosia. At first, Poseidon kept his champion a secret from the others until finally revealing the Theran warlord\u00a0Herodius as his champion. Herodius entered said contest to save his people from a plague secretly created by Poseidon, but never returned, as Kratos and his Spartans killed both Herodius and his army. After the Spartans took Herodius' ship, Poseidon, enraged at Kratos for costing him the wager, unleashed his Hippocampi upon the ship. Although the Spartans survived, Poseidon created a massive whirlpool which dragged the Spartans closer and closer to the bottom of the sea. He then sent the Sea Snake to kill the Spartans, but the beast was killed by Kratos. The Spartans docked safely at their destination, infuriating Poseidon even further.Aiding Kratos  For a period of time, the vicious beast known as the Hydra terrorized the Aegean Sea, until Kratos, guided by Athena, was called upon. Arriving upon a mess of shipwrecks, Kratos battled the various heads of the Hydra. During this feat, he was met by the great God Poseidon, who granted Kratos the gift of Poseidon's Rage. With this magical ability, Kratos was able to cast a stream of lightning through his body into his enemies, destroying them or weakening them enough so that he may finish them off. This ability would also be of important use while battling against the Hydra King, the strongest and largest of the Hydra's heads. After destroying the beast, the nightmare the Hydra had caused for many sailors in the Aegean Sea came to an end. Poseidon was also given a section devoted to him in Pandora's Temple. In this section, Kratos obtained Poseidon's Trident, granting him the ability to breathe underwater and dive.Atlantis' Destruction  While Poseidon does not appear physically, the Ocean God attacks Kratos with a massive whirlpool and other hazards as the Spartan tries to make his way back to the now sunken Atlantis. Later, he manifests himself through one of his statues. Infuriated with Kratos for releasing Thera, the Titaness of fire, and having her destroy Atlantis, his beloved city, he vows he will never forget Kratos' actions, promising he would one day answer for them. Also, his personal army, his \"children\", the Tritons, appear as enemies.The Second Titanomachy  Poseidon is among the Gods who are listening to Zeus, who declares that they must unite against the new threat of Kratos, formerly the God of War and now a rogue mortal. Once the walls of Olympus begin to tremble, Poseidon and the other Gods ready themselves to face the Titans who have been saved from their banishment in the Great War by Kratos using the Loom of Fate. After sharing looks with his brother Zeus, Poseidon dives off Mount Olympus, right into Epimetheus' chest, knocking him off the mountain, killing him almost instantly. Poseidon then dives into a large body of water at the base of the mountain, summoning a tendril from below that grabs Gaia's arm and begins pulling her. After Kratos defeats his minions, Poseidon then emerges within a watery construct in his image, projecting Hippocampi from his chariot. Poseidon sends his steeds to attack and restrain Gaia while he himself struggles with both Gaia and Kratos.Death  After a vicious battle, Gaia punches his chest, sending Kratos on a collision course with Poseidon's human form, which Kratos rips out of the watery construct and onto a platform. There he closes in on the weakened Poseidon, who warns Kratos that the destruction of Olympus would destroy the entire world. Kratos is unfazed by this, and proceeds to beat Poseidon uncontrollably; slamming his uncle's face repeatedly against a wall, and hitting him with his own head, before throwing him to a nearby wall. Poseidon then made a desperate attempt to escape and survive, but is unable to reach the edge and is grabbed by Kratos, who then proceeds to crush his eyes and finally\u00a0break his neck, killing the sea god once and for all. This last struggle is seen through Poseidon's own perspective. As Poseidon's lifeless body falls to the water below,\u00a0his death causes a tidal wave that floods most of Greece. This would probably explain why the Desert of Lost Souls does not exist anymore. In Poseidon's Chamber, Kratos finds a note Poseidon left where it is indicated he became interested in Pandora's power over Olympus and suspicious of Zeus' intentions, expressing fear his brother has changed for the worst. The note reads:\nA mere girl, somehow she is the key to the labyrinth. I brought this statue here, but so far have learned nothing. That mortal Daedalus, in his madness, has devised a way to shield secrets from even my far-reaching view. This does not bode well. I fear Zeus is no longer the brother I once knew- Poseidon Another note indicates Poseidon's wrath and frustration towards Zeus, citing his brother's refusal to provide Olympus safe harbor from the storms that are brewing. What Poseidon means by that last comment is not clear, but it might allude to the apocalyptic future that Poseidon may have foreseen i.e. the destruction of Olympus. Even though Poseidon fought alongside his brother, he alone still had misgivings about Zeus.Multiplayer  Poseidon is one of the four mentors of God of War: Ascension's Multiplayer. His statue is the fourth one in the Rotunda of Olympus.Overview  The God of the Seas mainly focuses on defense and teamwork rather on attack power.\u00a0 Warriors\u00a0aligned to Poseidon have the best resistance to damage in the game, however, they're also the weakest damage dealers, which makes Poseidon the polar opposite to Ares in Multiplayer. This makes the alignment mostly undesirable for many players. He also grants his servants powers over ice and\u00a0the ability to heal their injured allies. A warrior of Poseidon can resist very serious blows that most players would normally not be able to, but must learn to deal with the lack of physical power, which can make battles last much longer. Teamwork is the ultimate key to becoming a great warrior of the seas.Support  Resilient to damage.Water Magic  Decrease mobility and freeze opponents.Poseidon Items  Increase defense and increase team ability.Poseidon Weapons  Can decrease enemies mobility with ice and heal nearby allies in certain special attacks.Poseidon Armors  Focus on physical and elemental resistances rather than in damage.Personality  Prior to being infected by the evils of Pandora's Box, Poseidon was apparently a benevolent God, who cared greatly for many mortals and worshippers alike. He would often grant safe passage to many sailors and was protective of his own domain. In spite of his benevolent nature, he much like his brother cheated on Amphitrite by having many flings, Medusa and Princess being notable examples. After being infected probably with \"Anger\", he notably became much more angrier and weary as he gave multiple death threats to Kratos (who he aided in stopping the Hydra King prior to being infected) when the latter destroyed his city, warned him about challenging the Gods when confronting him and reasonably but angrily tried talking him out of destroying Olympus as it would mean the death of the entire world . Despite this, Poseidon notably showed greater resilience to the evils unlike his brethren, evidenced by his note indicating how he apologized to his Princess for making her the subject of his rage (though he did not free her) and disapproved of Zeus' cruelty towards Pandora as a result of \"Fear\" and expressed his fear that his brother changed for the worst.Powers and Abilities  Poseidon was among the most powerful of the Olympian gods, second only to his brother Zeus, and surpassing his brother, Hades. It is notable that Poseidon could have single-handedly bested the Titans in God of War III, having downed two of them and making short work of Gaia, had Kratos not intervened. It should be noted that his power seems to be in direct proportion to the amount of water nearby. During the Second Titanomachy, Poseidon was strong because he had access to the sea, but once Kratos separated him from it, he was more vulnerable. This would explain why Poseidon resorts to using lightning instead of water during the first Titanomachy.Trivia Related Pages Ares  Ares was the original Olympian God of War and the main antagonist of the\u00a0God of War\u00a0game and perpetrator behind the events of God of War: Ascension, which means that he was also responsible for setting the events of the series into motion by trapping, manipulating Kratos into slaying his family and indirectly responsible for his metamorphosis into the Ghost of Sparta and setting him on the path which would eventually lead to the destruction of Olympus at his hands. He was the son of Zeus and Hera. Ares was the oldest child of Zeus and was commonly referred as the most hated god on Mount Olympus, even before being killed by Kratos.Greek Mythology  Ares was the God of War, son of Zeus and Hera, and one of the most prominent and powerful Gods of Olympus. He was born after the Great War of the Gods and Titans and served his father faithfully for many years. He was also a rival of Athena, his younger sister, because they were both\u00a0gods, one of War, the other of Wisdom, and wished that the\u00a0other would stand\u00a0down.\u00a0His Roman counterpart was Mars.\u00a0Mars was held in much higher esteem, second only to Kronos; Ionic form of the Doric \u1f00\u03c1\u03ac (ara), \"bane, ruin\".\u00a0In God of War Series Alliance with the Furies  Ares came to covet all of Olympus, especially Zeus's throne, so he struck an alliance with The Furies, and persuaded them to take a more ruthless approach. After learning of the prophecy of the Marked Warrior, who is destined to destroy Olympus and kill Zeus, Ares conceived a child with Alecto in the hope that their child would be the marked one so that he could aid him in overthrowing Zeus and claiming his throne. Unfortunately, Orkos, Ares' child, was not up to his standards, and was disowned. The Furies, however, saw potential in Orkos and made him their oath-keeper.Encountering Kratos  Two Gods of Olympus, Ares and Athena, raided the city of Sparta in order to capture a child named Deimos, who had been suspected of being the mortal who would destroy Olympus in The Marked Warrior Prophecy. After Ares captured the boy, Deimos' brother, Kratos, charged toward Ares to save his older brother. Despite his efforts, however, Ares hit Kratos on the face, and created a bloody scar on his right eye. Ares was about to kill Kratos but Athena persuaded Ares to leave him be. Ares then left with Deimos, and Athena quickly apologized to Kratos. Ares then took Deimos to the Domain of Death, where he would be tortured for many years by Thanatos, the God of Death. Little did Ares know that the boy to whom he gave a scar would be the same boy who would Initially serve him and later leave him in adulthood after his family would be slaughtered by his own hands due to his machinations.Wager of the Gods  Years later, the Gods created a contest, and chose various mortals as their champions for the capture of the Ambrosia. In the wager of the Gods, Ares was seen in the comics choosing Kratos as his champion, and was confident that nothing would stop him in his quest for the Ambrosia. After a grueling journey, Kratos captured the Ambrosia, and thus made Ares the victor of the wager of the Gods.Kratos' Servitude  Kratos and his Spartan army were no match for the merciless barbarians tribes of the east. Being outnumbered and overpowered, Kratos' army was losing the battle. Kratos, about to be killed by Alrik, the Barbarian King, pledged himself to Ares, the God of War, in exchange for victory. After he saw Kratos as the potential warrior that he needed to overthrow Olympus, Ares accepted, violently wiped out the barbarians, and gave Kratos the Blades of Chaos as a sign of his servitude. To ensure that the Spartan became the perfect warrior and was bound to his will, Ares and the Furies devised three blood tests for Kratos. The first had already been completed: spilling the blood of enemies. The second, spilling the blood of innocents, was easy to accomplish with Kratos' rising bloodlust as he ended countless lives with his Spartan companions, and conquered most of Greece. The last rite was spilling the blood of loved ones. Ares led Kratos to attack a village built in honor and worship of Athena. The Spartan soldiers ruthlessly killed all who lived in the village, and burned their homes to the ground in the process. Upon reaching a strange temple, Kratos was warned by the Village Oracle not to venture within its walls. Ignoring the old woman, Kratos, blinded by bloodthirst, killed all who were within the walls of the temple, including his wife, Lysandra, and his daughter, Calliope. Ares appeared before the bloodstained hands of Kratos, and told him that it was necessary to have his family eliminated so that nothing stood in his way. The ashes of Kratos' loved ones were gathered by the Village Oracle who then placed them upon his skin as a permanent reminder of the monster he had become: the Ghost of Sparta. Enraged by Ares' deception, Kratos declared vengeance upon the God of War who once saved his life. After Kratos left Ares' service, the God of War's son, Orkos, learned of the injustice that his parents had inflicted on Kratos and turned against his father and his mothers. Orkos sought counsel from the Oracle, Aletheia, who revealed Ares' plot to overthrow Olympus. When Orkos and Aletheia went to warn Zeus, Ares discovered their attempt and sent the Furies after them. Orkos escaped while Aletheia had her eyes torn out and hidden in the ruined Statue of Apollo. The Furies then ruthlessly hunted Kratos to force him to return to Ares' service for their plan to reach its fruition. During Kratos' triumph over the Furies, it was revealed that Ares had wanted Kratos returned to him; the plan was ruined when Kratos killed the Furies and mercifully killed Orkos, who was remade the oath keeper to Kratos, and thereby severed his bond. Kratos managed to escape and served Olympus for 10 years, all while hoping to redeem himself as well as for his sins to be forgiven.Battle with Kratos  Jealousy came over Ares for Athena, and, as a result of that jealousy, Ares laid siege to Athens. Since Zeus had forbidden the Gods from waging war with one another, Athena could not step in to protect her city. Instead, Athena enlisted the help of Kratos, who had faithfully served the Gods for 10 years. Kratos was instructed to find Pandora's Box in order to kill Ares. While Ares relentlessly tore Athens apart, he suddenly sensed that Kratos had retrieved the Box. Although he was impressed, Ares picked up a broken pillar and hurled it into the desert, which flew into Pandora's Temple and struck Kratos in the chest, impaling him to a wall and killing him. Ares' Harpies retrieved the Box and brought it to him. However, Kratos escaped the Underworld through the help of the mysterious Grave Digger. Ares challenged Zeus, and threatened to open the Box and use it against Olympus. It seemed all was lost, until Ares looked behind him and saw a returning Kratos standing behind him. He then mocked Zeus by his saying that he sent a broken mortal to defeat the God of War. Kratos, using his power granted by Zeus, took the Box from Ares' hands and opened it. The Gods\u2019 power was unleashed, and Kratos felt its magic pour into him, which caused him to grow into a giant (though Ares was still noticeably bigger than him). Kratos' strength matched Ares, and the ultimate battle for power began. Ares claimed that Kratos was still just a mortal, and was every bit as weak as the day that he begged him to save his life. Kratos recalled that he was not the same man that Ares had found that day \u2013 the monster Ares created had returned to kill him. Ares boasted that Kratos had no idea of what a true monster really was. Ares then unleashed large spider-like spikes from his back, and was ready to finally kill Kratos for good. Kratos gained the upper hand during the fight, but Ares trapped him in an illusion\u00a0where his family was attacked by an army of clones of himself (representing his mistake of killing his wife and child), and stated that there were more effective ways of killing someone than just physical harm. Though Kratos had managed to kill all of the clones, Ares mocked him, ripped the Blades of Chaos from his arms, and killed the image of his family with them. The two of them returned to the real world, where Kratos was emotionally beaten, and Ares boasted that Kratos should have been stronger and prepared to kill him with His Sword.Death of Ares  Kratos, however spotted the Blade of the Gods (which had sent by Athena), dodged Ares' attack, took up the sword, and defeated him in battle with it. Ares pleaded for his life while reminding Kratos of the day that he had saved his life, and how he had only tried to make him a great warrior. Kratos ironically recanted that Ares had \"succeeded\" in doing that before he impaled him through the chest, and killed him. The God of War fell into the Aegean Sea, and was no more, dead at the hands of the mortal that he controlled many years ago. Before his last breath, Ares released a loud death cry, which caused blood to burst from his chest, and a powerful explosion was released. However, Kratos, having killed Ares, the one who made him kill his family, asked Athena to remove the nightmares of his past. Athena replied that even though he had been forgiven of his sins, the Gods nor any mortal could ever remove his memories of killing his family. Kratos realized that his nightmarish visions of his past sins would never leave him and thus tried to kill himself over Suicide Bluffs. Athena saved Kratos and said that the Gods could not allow him, who had done such good deeds for them, to die by his own hand. Athena then said that Ares's tactics and methods were brutal and while the Olympians mourned for their brother, Ares's path of destruction had to be stopped. However, with Ares's death,\u00a0there was an empty place on Olympus for a new God of War: Kratos. Kratos then ascended to Olympus and was given the crown, throne, and title as the new God of War, which meant that the peace of Ares' death was broken and whenever there were wars, for good or evil, they would be sought by and given permission to by Kratos, the new; all-powerful; and immortal God of War. After Kratos' success in defeating and killing Ares and becoming the new God of War, the Spartan citizens disowned Ares and hailed Kratos willingly (save for a few staunch supporters of Ares), and even removed all effigies of Ares and replaced them with those of Kratos. However, a few\u00a0faithful Disciples of Ares attempted to revive their fallen God of War with the power of the Ambrosia (a power that could resurrect even a God), but Kratos had destroyed Gyges, the island in which the Ambrosia rested on, in order to prevent the followers of Ares' plans from coming to fruition.After Ares' Death  After Kratos was betrayed by Zeus and stripped of his Godly powers, Kratos was rescued by Gaia, the Titaness of Earth, who told him that the Sisters of Fate had the power to help him go back in time, avert his betrayal and face Zeus. On the Island of Creation, Kratos came upon a room known as the Garden of the Gods, in which there was a Statue of Ares where he was referred to as \"The Fallen God of War\". Kratos, after he faced many challenges to get to the Sisters, finally arrived at the Temple of the Fates where he met one of the sisters, Lahkesis. She told Kratos that no one could change their destiny and then began to fight him. As Kratos hurt Lahkesis gravely, she summoned her sister, Atropos,\u00a0from within herself. Atropos quickly grabbed Kratos, took him inside the mirrors, and brought him back to the day where he faced and killed Ares. She threw Kratos on the Blade of the Gods that he used to kill Ares and become the new and great God of War. Then she tried to change his past by destroying the blade. With the blade gone, Ares would be victorious. In order to maintain his existence, Kratos protected the blade while he battled Atropos, eventually defeated her, secured his past, and trapped her inside the mirror.The Second Titanomachy  While he faced the Hippocampi on Gaia's hand, Kratos followed a path that lead to a chamber, the Tomb of Ares, which contained Ares' massive corpse that was concealed in ice. Kratos fought the first Centaur of the game there. Despite being dead, Ares played a small role in the third game, as he was mentioned by Athena, Hephaestus, Hera,\u00a0Cronos, Zeus, and Kratos, and was also shown in flashback scenes. There was also a large fresco of Ares in the upper part of the Chamber of the Flame, which showed him wielding his trademark sword. That fresco was located right next to a fresco of his mother, Hera. Ares' voice was heard when Kratos ended up in his psyche. With the death of Zeus and the near destruction of the world, Ares' plan for Kratos to take down the Olympian Gods and Mount Olympus came to full fruition, though not as he hoped.Multiplayer  Ares was one of the mentors of God of War: Ascension 's Multiplayer\u00a0and the only mentor who was not a son of Cronos. His statue was the first one in the Rotunda of Olympus.Overview  \"With the powers of the god of war, a warrior of Ares is what some might call a \"glass cannon\": the best physical damage dealers from the game, but also the least resistant to damage. This makes Ares the opposite to Poseidon in Multiplayer. His warriors also have a natural bond with fire and heat, which makes them even more fierce by allowing them to keep burning and harming enemies even after an attack.\" A Warrior of Ares could annihilate his enemies in a matter of seconds, but must watch out for incoming attacks. The God of War's servants could survive in hoards of enemies by themselves, which made that the best class for Trial of the Gods.Warrior  Dominant physical powers.Fire Magic  Damage over time and disable enemy defenses.Ares Items  Enhanced melee combat.Ares Weapons  Grant damage bonuses and burn enemies over time in certain special attacks.Ares Armors  Focus on enhancing physical powers.Ares Symbols  Spear, helmet, dog, vulture, and flaming torch.Powers and Abilities  As the original god of war, Ares possessed a formidable arsenal of superhuman and magical abilities - all in correlation with combat and warfare, as these were his spheres of influence. As an Olympian prince and son of Zeus, his powers were considerably stronger than lesser gods.Personality  Being the god of war, violence and bloodshed, Ares is cruel, sadistic, and violent, as seen by his caring only about spreading chaos and conflict across the world. According to Zeus, Ares only feels joy when destroying cities and nations. Ares is also extremely greedy and power hungry, as exemplified by his wishing to destroy his father, so he can replace him as the new king of gods and the ruler of Olympus. However, all his attempts to overthrow Zeus failed. He was even arrogant to the point of openly calling out Zeus and challenging his rule. Ares also considered love for one's family a weakness, which is evident by how he tricked Kratos into murdering his family as he believed they were holding back his servant from becoming a great warrior only to learn the hard way that he should have been careful when it came to what he was asking for when he was killed by his former servant. This shows that Ares never cared much for his kin, as he plotted to kill his father Zeus and disowned his son Orkos after he could not meet Ares' expectations. His relationship with his mother Hera and brother Hephaestus was unknown as he was not shown despising them. Ares envies his sister Athena, as she was favoured by Zeus and was always trying to prove himself as superior to her in every way, such as creating the perfect warrior for example. Eventually, his hatred and jealousy for his sister makes him attempt to destroy the sacred city Athens; however he was stopped and killed by Kratos, with the support of Athena herself.Appearance  Ares appears as a giant warrior god. He wears a brown sleeveless tunic, shoulder pieces with wolf faces built into them, and has bracers and boots with chains on them. His boots go up to his knees. He has long hair and a beard, which seem to be made of fire.Relationships Zeus  Unlike most of the other gods, Ares ignored Zeus's orders and had no fear of Zeus's wrath, to the point that he challenged his father several times while mocking him for sending a \"broken mortal\" to fight him, instead of facing Ares by himself.Athena  Ares has a deep hatred for his sister, as he refuses to even stay in Olympus when she is around. Ares considers Athena weak and is always trying to prove himself as superior to the goddess of war, or attacking her in every opportunity, as when he would command Kratos to attack the villages and cities that were sacred to the goddess. Ares envies the amount of respect and worship that Athena receives from other deities and mortals, while he himself is hated and despised.Kratos  Back in the days when Kratos was still his servant, Ares considered him an almost \"perfect warrior\", possibly because they both shared the same rage, hatred and love for bloodshed. However, unlike Ares, Kratos still loved and cared deeply for his family; feelings that were considered a weakness by the god of war. After Kratos abandoned Ares, the warrior god started to despise Kratos, considering him just a \"broken mortal\" with no value and saying he was every bit as weak as the day the Spartan begged Ares to save his life.Trivia God of War II  God of War II is a hack-and-slash action-adventure video game and the sequel to the God of War video game for the PlayStation 2. It was released in North America on March 13, 2007, in Europe on April 27, and on May 3, 2007 in Australia. The North American NTSC version of God of War II is packaged in a two-disc set. The first disc contains the game, and the second disc is dedicated to the game's development, including a diary of the game's production. The European/Australian PAL version comes in two different editions: a single disc standard edition and a two disc \"Special Edition\" that comes in a different case than the single disc edition. It also includes different box art, a bonus DVD, as well as the PAL version of the game. God of War II won a Golden Joystick for \"PlayStation Game of the Year 2007\" at the 2007 Golden Joystick Awards.Gameplay  The gameplay of God of War II is very similar to that of its predecessor. The player controls Kratos\u00a0through a combination of combat, platforming, and puzzle game elements. It also keeps the concept of using minigames to perform bloody kills. Another element that returns from the previous game is Kratos ability to find Red Orbs to level up his weapons and magic and Gorgon Eyes and Phoenix Feathers to increase his health and magic meters. Like the previous God of War, Kratos receives numerous weapons and magical powers all throughout his quest, given to him by certain characters, or taken from his enemies. These items offer small enhancements in terms of gameplay over God of War, such as Icarus' Wings (an item cut from the original game), which allows the player to glide short distances, the Golden Fleece, which allows players to repel projectiles, and the Blades of Athena, an item returning from the first game which now lets players swing from highlighted objects.Plot  God of War II takes place shortly after the events of God of War: Ghost of Sparta; Kratos, after defeating Ares, has become the new God of War, but unfortunately has not been accepted by the other Gods due to his ruthless treatment of the other Greek city-states. Kratos is still haunted by memories of the deeds from his past while working under Ares. He finds enjoyment the only way he can, by leading and aiding his Spartan army in conquering Greece. Athena pleads that Kratos stop, telling him that she cannot protect him much longer from the wrath of Olympus and that he should not turn his back on her because it was she who made him a god. Kratos replies that he owes nothing to her and descends to the battle of Rhodes to assist his Spartan army. Kratos joins the fight as a God and begins destroying the city of Rhodes. After a short while, Kratos notices an Eagle, who Kratos believes to be Athena in disguise. The bird robs him of his godly height, infusing them into the Colossus of Rhodes and bringing it to life to kill Kratos. After a protracted conflict with the metal giant that rages across the city, Zeus offers Kratos the Blade of Olympus, which Zeus himself used to win the Great War between the Gods and the Titans. At Zeus' behest, Kratos infuses the Blade with his godhood, rendering him mortal but enabling him to destroy the Colossus from the inside. However, Kratos soon finds himself mortally wounded after being crushed by the severed, falling hand of the statue. Kratos realizes he must retrieve the Blade of Olympus to save himself. As he slowly gets up and limps his way to the sword, Zeus reveals himself as the Eagle that stole his power, and he betrayed Kratos so that his fate will not be the same as Ares'. Zeus then stabs the Blade of Olympus into Kratos' chest, killing him after he refuses to forever serve the Gods. However, as Kratos is being dragged towards an eternity of torment in the Underworld, he is saved by Gaia, the mother of the Titans and the franchise's narrator, who offers an alliance. Gaia tells the story of Zeus and how Cronos, Zeus' father, ate all of his children to prevent the prophecy that one of his own children would rise against him and how Rhea, Zeus' mother, saved her child and sent him away to an island that was really Gaia, the Titaness Mother of Earth and Zeus' grandmother, and Gaia nurtured Zeus until he grew to be a man and sought revenge against Cronos and all the Titans. As the Great War between the Gods and the Titans emerged, Zeus soon created a powerful weapon called the Blade of Olympus to end the Great War and with the Blade he banished the Titans to the depths of Tartarus. When the Titans were defeated by the Gods, they were punished and humiliated, and they want Kratos' help to exact revenge. Kratos escapes the Underworld and is bidden by Gaia to find the Sisters of Fate in order to change his past and avert his betrayal and kill Zeus. She gives Kratos the aid of the magical horse Pegasus to traverse the distance to the Sisters. Kratos and Pegasus, after a detour to a mountain that houses the Titan Typhon and the former Titan Prometheus, start flying towards The Island of Creation, but are again attacked by Griffins and Ravens, aided by the Dark Rider. The Dark Rider succeeds in slamming into Pegasus, sending the horse plummeting to its death, but Kratos counter-attacks by jumping onto The Dark Griffin, killing the Dark Rider with the Spear of Destiny, and killing the Dark Griffin by lodging the spear in its neck, as Kratos dives to the Island of Creation below. As he explores the island, Kratos encounters the likes of Theseus, from whom he kills and gains the Horse Keeper's Key and the Steeds of Time (a gift to the Sisters of Fate from Cronos in an attempt to change his own fate), Perseus, whom he savagely kills and takes his reflective shield to progress, the captain from the ship in the beginning of the God of War, and the Barbarian King whom he decapitated in the original God of War, from whom he takes the Barbarian Hammer. Kratos also encounters a haggard and crazed Icarus, whom he takes the Icarus' Wings from, and the Gorgon queen Euryale, from whom he gained the Head of Euryale by decapitating. Kratos lands upon the Titan Atlas below the earth and tries to communicate with him. At first Atlas resents the sight of the Spartan and refuses to help Kratos, bent on crushing the human for his new imprisonment since their last meeting in God of War: Chains of Olympus. However, Kratos manages to persuade Atlas to help him so that he may change his fate and kill Zeus. With the Titan accepting the offer, he grants Kratos a new power called the Atlas Quake and helps him back to the surface so that he may continue his quest. After reaching the surface he kills the Kraken and reawakens the Phoenix to fly towards the Temple of Fates with his desire for revenge for Zeus and a knowledge of Zeus destroying Sparta acts as an anger that helps him continue his quest. Finally reaching the Throne Room, Kratos expresses his firm desire to change his own fate, and that of Zeus, the King of the Gods of Olympus, after which the Sisters deny him passage through. Kratos then confronts Lahkesis. After a gruesome battle, Kratos stands witness as the middle sister Atropos comes forth from within the defeated Lahkesis, taking Kratos back in time, to the very moment of his battle with Ares. Planning on cutting his life short by destroying the Blade of the Gods, Kratos interferes by defending the Blade of the Gods, thus keeping the way things originally were. He soon defeats Atropos before traveling back to the present time while leaving Atropos trapped in a mirror. Now fighting both Lahkesis and Atropos at the same time, Kratos manages to stab the two Sisters with his blades and destroy the mirror they are trapped in. Thus, killing them by erasing the sisters out of the timeline. With Lakhesis and Atropos dead, Kratos makes his way to the remaining sister, Clotho, who operates and defends the Loom of Fate, which rules the lives of mortals and Gods alike. Pinning Clotho's hands to the ground, Kratos kills the final sister, granting him control over the Loom and his own fate. He goes back to his death at Zeus' hands in Rhodes, saving his past self and reclaiming the Blade of Olympus from a surprised Zeus, inciting a lengthy battle with the King of the Gods. At the end of the fight, Zeus stuns Kratos with a powerful lighting storm, Kratos then announces untruthfully that he surrenders. As Zeus is about to kill Kratos, he deflects the blow using an energy blast and pins Zeus's hands to the rock with The Blades of Athena. Kratos then takes the Blade of Olympus and begins driving it into Zeus' chest. Before he could finish, Athena arrives and defends Zeus, however, Kratos is angered by her interference as Athena announces her intentions to protect Olympus. The badly wounded Zeus attempts to escape, while stating Kratos has started a war he can't possibly win. However, Kratos breaks free of the defending Athena, charging towards Zeus with the Blade of Olympus, but Athena sacrifices herself by impaling herself upon the blade, granting Zeus escape. A stunned Kratos asks her why she did this as the dying goddess reveals that Zeus' actions are meant to break the cycle of son killing father, which goes back to Cronos defeating Uranus, and Zeus defeating Cronos. By killing Kratos before he can kill him, Zeus had hoped to break the cycle - thus confirming that Kratos is, in fact, Zeus' own son, she begs him to relent in his quest for vengeance. After a moment of apparent shock and shame, Kratos darkens and snarls that he has no father. Athena dies in Kratos' arms, saying that all the Gods on Olympus will deny Kratos, defending Zeus so Olympus will prevail. She said that even though Kratos wishes to kill Zeus, Zeus is Olympus. Kratos then vows to exact retribution on Zeus and any God who will deny him his vengeance, saying that their time is at an end. The dead Athena's body soon explodes as Gaia speaks to Kratos and reminds him that he has the power to control time itself. Kratos returns to the Loom, as the room its in collapses around him and he goes back in time once more to the Great War of the Gods and Titans. He calls to Gaia and she announces that the Titans were expecting him and then Kratos explains they can win the Great War in his time. As a defeated Zeus encourages his fellow Gods to help him kill Kratos, the Titans return to Kratos' time, angry and vengeful they climb Mount Olympus to kill Zeus and the Gods. Leading them, Kratos announces to Zeus \"Zeus! Your son has returned, I bring the destruction of Olympus!!!\", thus leading directly into the events of God of War III.Characters Enemies Common Enemies Bosses Items and abilities Weapons Magics Relics Treasures  Much like the first God of War, upon beating the game, additional costumes can be unlocked, for Kratos to wear. Similar to Challenge of the Gods, God of War II offers Challenge of the Titans after beating the game once. A new addition has Kratos collecting urns that give him special powers. Another new feature called \"Bonus Play\" allows one to replay the game with all of Kratos' weapons and powers, as well as using the Urns of Power previously collected.Bonus Costumes Cast Critical Reception  Upon its release, God of War II garnered overwhelming critical and commercial acclaim. Many consider it to be one of PlayStation 2's best games, and also one of the best action games of all time. It contains four times as many boss fights and improved puzzles in comparison to the original. The game is also considered to be the swan song of the PlayStation 2 era \u2014 in other words, the last great game released exclusively for the console. In North America, the game had sold 833,209 copies by the end of March 2007, twice as many copies as the next-best selling game. In its first week of release in Europe, the game took the top spot in the UK charts as well. The game went on to sell over one million copies in its first three months. As of July 11, 2007, the game has sold two million copies. On March 13, 2008, God of War II joined Sony's renowned Greatest Hits list.Cut Content See also Trivia External links Gaia  Gaia is the Primordial entity of the Earth, mother of the Titans and the grandmother and great-grandmother of the Olympian Gods. She is the narrator of the series,\u00a0the deuteragonist\u00a0of God of War II, and the secondary antagonist of God of War III.Greek Mythology  In Greek mythology, Gaia (\u0393\u03b1\u00ee\u03b1) was the primordial goddess personifying the earth. She was an ancient chthonic deity and was considered the Mother Goddess of all life. Gaia is also known as Mother Earth. Gaia created Ouranos but later Ouranos (Roman: Caelus) and Gaia created the starry sky. Together they created the elemental Titans, amongst others the world ocean Oceanus, the pre-Olympic sun Hyperion (\"The High-One\"), Iapetus (father of Prometheus), Rhea, Mnemosyne (\"Memory\"), Phoebe (\"Light\") and Tethys (wife and sister of Oceanus, mother of the world rivers). After they were born, Cronos, the wily, youngest, and most terrible of her children, who hated his sire, was asked by Gaia to punish Ouranos for sending the Cyclops and Hecatonchires to Tartarus. Wielding a flint sickle, Cronos castrated him and threw his testicles into the sea, it's foam creating Aphrodite. After that, Cronos would rule the world until he was overthrown by Zeus and his siblings. Other Titan-born creatures came from Gaia such as the Hecatonchires and the dragon Python. Her equivalent in the Roman pantheon was Terra.In the God of War series  In the God of War series, Gaia is the narrator for all of the games but has only actually appeared in God of War II and God of War III. She is portrayed as being made of earth, covered head to toe with trees, and fuller in shape reminiscent of the Venus of Willendorf, though in Greek Mythology she was essentially the Earth itself.Birth and Early Days  Being one of the Primordial, Gaia was a descendant of Chaos. Together she and the other Primordials created the universe. Wishing to survey their work, they made the Island of Creation, where all life would begin. The first to be born was Gaia, who would become the mother of the earth. Ouranos, the Primordial god of the sky and lord of the heavens, joined with Gaia and giving birth to the Elder Cyclopes, the Hecatonchires, and the Titans.First Titanomachy  It was prophesized that one day Cronos would also be overthrown by his children, just as he overthrew his own father. In an attempt to avoid this, he swallowed them whole after they were born. However, Cronos's wife, Rhea, could not bear another loss and tricked Cronos into swallowing an Omphalos Stone wrapped in cloth. This baby was named Zeus and would be raised within Gaia's own body until he came of age and decided to take revenge upon Cronos. When Zeus became an adult, he freed his brothers and sisters from the belly of Cronos and began a revolt against the Titans, starting the Great War. During this war, Gaia aided the Titans in the battle and was eventually cast into Tartarus along with her children. Following these events, Gaia kept watch over the life of the Spartan Warrior and her great-grandson Kratos, hoping to use his talents in her desire for her future vengeance against Zeus.God of War II Alliance with Kratos  Following Zeus betraying Kratos and his subsequent fall into the Underworld, Gaia deemed the time was right to finally reveal herself to Kratos. She appeared before the Spartan who questioned her identity as she revealed her name and how she been watching him throughout all his life and has decided to help him destroy Zeus. She then heals his wounds and tells him with her help, she would guide to the Sisters of Fate to aid him in his quest. Once Kratos escaped, Gaia sent the Pegasus to help in his journey. When Kratos ordered the Pegasus to take him to Olympus, Gaia told him he was no longer a god and that he could no longer access the Mountain. She then explains for Kratos to get revenge, he would need the power of the Sisters of Fate to travel back in time to the moment Zeus betrayed him so he could reclaim Blade of Olympus as Zeus would be at his most vulnerable. She directed him to her son Typhon but the latter was not willing to aid an \"Olympian\" trapping the Pegasus as Gaia told Kratos it was needed to reach the Sisters. As a result, Kratos was forced to explore the cavern before he managed to steal Typhon's Bane and soon coming upon Prometheus and after killing him to put him out of his misery, his blood merged with the fires granting Kratos Rage of the Titans which he used to free the Pegasus and leave the cavern. Kratos soon arrived on the Island of Creation where he journeyed facing many enemies. In the middle of his quest, Kratos inquired as to why Gaia chose to aid him as she told Kratos the story of events that led to the Great War and how she was banished at the end of the but helped Kratos in his quest for revenge. When Kratos nearly fell into the Underworld after a fight with Icarus, Gaia told Kratos that he needed to return to the surface. Perhaps fortunately and unfortunately, Kratos landed on Atlas who nearly crushed him but he managed to persuade him to aid him in destroying Zeus. Atlas helped Kratos in returning to the surface and the Spartan resumed his journey. When reaching the Garden of the Gods, Athena possessed a statue and warned Kratos not to trust Gaia or the Titans stating they are using him but he disregarded her warning by destroying the statue. When Kratos fought and killed the Last Spartan and was distraught by the destruction of his home Sparta, Gaia appeared in a mental image posing as Lysandra, Kratos' wife. As the Ghost of Sparta lost hope, Gaia warned him if Zeus discovered he was still alive the latter would come after him relentlessly and that when Kratos dies Zeus' brother Hades would ensure his soul would be forever tormented. She soon gave him hope again by telling him to take in his loss of his city and people to fuel his rage and achieve victory. She told him that he was needed to lead the Titans into battle. Her words encouraged Kratos and he defeated the Kraken and soon made his way to the Sister's palace. Upon confronting Lahkesis, she stated Gaia was filling his head with lies before fighting him with her sister Atropos. This warning along with Athena's warnings foreshadowed Gaia's impending actions. When Kratos trapped them both in a mirror, he destroyed erasing them from existence before he killed the last Clotho. With the sisters gone, Kratos had access to the power of time as Gaia told him to look among Threads of Fate for his own in order to go back to the moment of Zeus' betrayal. Kratos returned to the moment Zeus tried to kill him where he reclaimed the Blade of Olympus and confronted Zeus. After a fierce battle, he nearly succeeded in killing him but Athena intervened and Kratos stabbed her instead. A dying Athena revealed that Kratos was Zeus' son which by extension made Gaia his great-grandmother. After Athena's last pleas failed to convince Kratos to abandon his revenge, Gaia reminded him that he still had the power to control time itself. With this Kratos returned to his time, he soon rewinds time to go further into the past going farther than his own birth to the final moments of the great war. Kratos called out to Gaia who had been expecting his arrival stating the gods were too much for them now. However, Kratos told her that Ares and Athena were dead while Zeus was weakened and that he now possessed the Blade of Olympus. He told her that if they work together, they could destroy the gods and see Mount Olympus crumble. Realizing that he needed them to come to his future, Kratos told Gaia to come to his time along with the other Titans from the first Great War. This act saved them from their banishment to Tartarus and allowed them to scale the mountain to exact vengeance. Gaia carried Kratos on her back as the Spartan told Zeus that his son had returned to bring forth the destruction of Olympus. This marked the beginning of the Titans' Second Great War with the gods.Second Titanomachy  Gaia and Kratos led the Titans in battle as they climbed Mount Olympus, however, the Olympian Gods were not scared and quickly engaged their former enemies again igniting the Second Titanomachy. As Titans clashed against the Gods they also encountered the minions of Gods who jumped into the fray and used their abilities to attempt to knock the behemoths off the mountain but this did not deter the Titans nor Kratos who defended them with his powers determined to make the Gods pay. Unfortunately, the Sea God Poseidon entered the battle and after killing Epimetheus summoned his Hippocampi which began to attack the Titans pulling them to their deaths. One of the monsters latched onto Gaia preventing her from climbing, the titan had told Kratos to free her from the constraints after doing so the two came face to face with the Hippocampi version of Poseidon who using his mighty trident and his minions had delivered many powerful blows to Gaia. However, after Kratos defeated the monsters and attacked Poseidon's head, the god was left immobilized. Taking advantage of this, Gaia punched at her grandson's chest which also launched Kratos in a clear path of the sea god's chest knocking him out of his monster projectile and throwing him on a platform of the mountain where he was brutally killed off personally by Kratos. After Poseidon's death, Gaia told Kratos the death of Zeus was within their reach and the two continued their travel towards Zeus. Arriving at the Dias, the two confronted Zeus who traded words with his son over his quest for vengeance as Kratos swore to destroy him but the King of the Gods prepared to fire a lightning bolt at them. Gaia attempted to halt the attack but it was futile as the blast sent Gaia and Kratos plummeting back down the Mountain.Betraying Kratos  Gripping to Mount Olympus for dear life, one of Gaia's hands partially snapped off due to Zeus' attack barely connected by enormous vines. Kratos attempted to hold onto Gaia's back with the Blade of Olympus, but after calling for aid, Gaia refuses. Stating both of them would die if she tried to help, and trivializing Kratos' revenge as being secondary to the Titans' own goal for vengeance. Gaia then told him that he was a mere pawn that had lost its usefulness, before letting him fall stating the war was for the Titans. As the Spartan fell, he swore revenge on Gaia for using him.Gaia's downfall  When Kratos escaped the Underworld after killing Hades, he managed to reach the city of Olympia, where he encountered Gaia again. The titan was astonished to find Kratos still alive remarking the \"blood of Cronos\" served him well. She was in distress, asking Kratos for his help as Kratos, still enraged about Gaia not having helped him in his hour of need, questioned why he should. Gaia soon begged her great-grandson for help but Kratos started to sever the vines connected to Gaia's snapped-off hand. Desperate and in pain, Gaia asked Kratos if she meant nothing to him to which The Ghost of Sparta retorted in a show of cruel irony it was, in fact, Gaia who was the pawn, his pawn while telling a pleading Gaia that the war against Zeus was \"his war\" not hers. Kratos then destroyed the root of Gaia's hand with the Blade of Olympus, sending a screaming Gaia plummeting to her apparent doom at the bottom of Mount Olympus. Much later, Perses attacked Kratos in shafts of the labyrinth presumably for what happened with Gaia but Kratos killed him instead. When Kratos visited Tartarus, he came across Gaia's severed hand and met with Cronos, who stated Gaia was dead and subsequently attempted to kill Kratos to avenge her only for Kratos to kill him.Gaia's Death  When finally having reached Zeus again, Kratos did battle with him before their fight was interrupted as Gaia had returned, having replaced her severed hand with one made of twisted tree roots. Declaring the reign of Olympus ended now, Kratos was shocked that she survived as states she never sought Kratos' death, but she now saw no other option due to the damage he had inflicted upon her Earth. Zeus commented she should have chosen the other one, but Gaia simply replied she would destroy them both, crushing the Shrine of Olympus in her hands. Both father and son fell into Gaia and found their way back to her heart, where Kratos shattered its defenses, and drew energy from the Titan, causing her immense pain. After Zeus made his appearance, the battle resumed, until Kratos stabbed Zeus with the Blade of Olympus and ran him through Gaia's heart, she screamed in terrible agony and pain as her heart exploded, killing her as her body collapsed onto Olympus possibly killing all of the remaining survivors while dissolving into dust. When Kratos awakened from the fall, all that remained of the mighty Titan were large chunks of earth, and some withered trees and branches.Personality  Gaia was once a caring and loving Titan, helping anyone no matter the cost. She even cared for and nurtured Zeus, when the young god was hiding from his father Cronos. However, after the Great War, when all Titans were punished for the crimes of one, Gaia's heart became filled with hatred for Zeus and the Olympians. She became so obsessed with vengeance that she started to rebel against the Sisters of Fate themselves, manipulating Kratos as a pawn and then, discarding him and anyone else who dared to cross her path, only seeking to exact her revenge against the Gods of Olympus.Powers and Abilities  As the primordial and personification of the earth, Gaia has absolute control and manipulation over rocks and plants of the world. She has superhuman strength, stamina, durability and is an Immortal. She also can be considered to have omniscience since she is narrator of the games. She also possesses considerable regenerative abilities, as she was able to grow back the hand Kratos chopped off of her. She also seems to have the power to communicate throughout time as she was expecting Kratos during the first Titanomachy even though it was centuries before Kratos' birth.Trivia Athena  Athena was the Olympian Goddess of Wisdom and War, and the Deuteragonist of the God of War Series, who mostly appeared as an ally of Kratos. She was seen as a neutral character\u00a0in God of War II, and her place as Deuteragonist was taken by Orkos in God of War: Ascension, by Gaia in God of War II, and by Atreus in God of War (2018). In the middle stages of\u00a0God of War III, after Gaia betrayed Kratos, Athena took her place back as the Deuteragonist and helped Kratos in ways that she was able to. She had a cameo appearance as an illusion in God of War (2018), where she goads Kratos about his past.Greek Mythology  Athena (also pronounced Athene), also referred to as Pallas Athena (\u03a0\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03c2 \u0391\u03b8\u03b7\u03bd\u03ac; pronounced /\u02c8p\u00e6l\u0259s/), was the Goddess of Civilization, Wisdom, War, Strategy, Craft, Justice, and Skill in Greek Mythology. Minerva, Athena's Roman incarnation, embodied similar attributes. Athena was also a shrewd companion of heroes and the Goddess of heroic endeavor. She was the virgin patron of Athens. The Athenians\u00a0built the Parthenon on the Acropolis of her namesake city, Athens, in her honor (Athena Parthenos).Biography Hunting the Marked Warrior  Zeus, driven by fear after hearing the oracle's prophecy that Olympian rule would end at the hands of a \"Marked Warrior\", sent Ares and Athena to capture the one destined to overthrow Zeus. Noticing the strange birth marks on Deimos, they invaded Sparta and captured the boy. His older brother, Kratos, tried to stop them, but was easily swatted aside by the God of War. Before Ares could kill Kratos, Athena intervened and told him they already had what they came for. Before she left, she gave one last look to the young Kratos and asked for forgiveness. That set in motion the prophecy, as they unknowingly picked the wrong Spartan youth; it was Kratos who would destroy Olympus, not Deimos.Siege of Athens  Out of utter hatred and jealousy towards Athena, Ares summoned monsters from the Underworld and used them to attack the city of Athens. Since Zeus had forbidden the Gods from battling each other directly, Ares thought that nothing could stop him. For this reason, Athena and the other Gods sought to empower Kratos to save Athens and put an end to Ares' rampage once and for all. She guided him throughout the game to Pandora's Box. After the death of Ares, she revealed that Kratos was forgiven of his sins, but the Gods never agreed to relieve him of his nightmares; no Mortal or God\u00a0could ever forget the terrible things that he had done. With all hope lost, Kratos felt abandoned and flung himself from the Suicide Bluffs that overlooked the Aegean Sea and believed that death was his only escape from his madness. However, Athena saved Kratos from falling to his death.\u00a0The Gods had not abandoned Kratos at all. Athena gave Kratos the throne of Ares and the title of God of War. She also granted him the Blades of Athena to replace the Blades of Chaos that were given to (and taken away from) him by Ares.Aiding the God of War Kratos' Hunt for the Ambrosia  As Kratos made his way to the Ambrosia once again, Athena tried to warn him about the many dangers on the path to the Ambrosia. Kratos simply shrugged off her warnings however, and moved on. Kratos later encountered her again, and was told by the Goddess that it was the dead that he must fear. Further on, Kratos found the dead Spartan\u00a0Soldiers whom he had abandoned many years ago. They returned from the dead and were ready to fight Kratos and kill him in anger and vengeance, but Kratos defeated them.Finding Deimos  After the events of God of War, Kratos set out on a journey to find his mother, Callisto, an act which Athena tried to prevent. After the two debated on whether or not Kratos should abandon this quest, soldiers of Triton attacked the ship. After Kratos (reluctantly) defeated Callisto in battle, he proclaimed to Athena that the Gods had lied to him about his brother. After gaining no response to his proclamations, Athena finally answered, tried to warn Kratos, attempted to dissuade him, and begged for forgiveness. Kratos then realized that she was there when his brother was kidnapped years ago as she stated that there were reasons for it. Enraged by that revelation, Kratos destroyed the Statue which Athena had used to communicate with him. After the death of both Deimos and Thanatos, Athena came out of a Portal, she told him that his ties to the Mortal World were severed and that he was ready to be a God. She then attempted to empower Kratos to full Godhood, but Kratos refused however, and swore that the Gods would pay for the pain that they had\u00a0caused him and his family. After Kratos had left for Olympus, Athena begged for his forgiveness and even went so far as to silently acknowledge him as her brother.Zeus' Betrayal  Unfortunately, Kratos was a far more ruthless God of War than Ares ever was. Shunned by his fellow Gods, and angry toward them for not ridding him of his nightmares (and the suffering his mother and brother went through), he turned to his Spartan Army. Together, they began to conquer all of Greece. Athena warned Kratos that if he did not stop his path of destruction, the wrath of Olympus would grow ever stronger and that she would not be able to protect him. Kratos disbelieved Athena, turned his back on her, and went to the island of Rhodes where his Spartan army had lain siege. Athena was left with no other choice but to help rid Olympus of Kratos. As a colossal God, Kratos tore apart the city of Rhodes until an eagle flew over him, drained much of his godly power, and shrunk him down to mortal size. At first, Kratos believed that it was Athena\u2019s act of defiance against him, until it was actually revealed to be the King of the Gods himself \u2013 Zeus.Speaking to Kratos  During Kratos\u2019 journey through the Island of Creation, he came upon the Garden of the Gods, where a golden statue of Athena warned him not to listen to Gaia or the Titans (this warning would later prove to be justified during the events of God of War III). She soon explained to Kratos that there were more important things besides seeking revenge and that Zeus did what he had to in order to protect Olympus: The King of the Gods did in fact fear Kratos. However, Kratos ignored the warning, destroyed the statue, continued on his quest to the Sisters of Fate, and soon defeated them.Death  The warnings of Athena did not move Kratos, and he continued his path of vengeance until he faced Zeus once again. Taking the Blade of Olympus, Kratos stabbed Zeus with it repeatedly until Athena intervened. Angered by her interference, Kratos pushed her aside and struck at the fleeing Zeus. Athena threw herself in front of Zeus before he could be stabbed, and fell by Kratos\u2019 hand. Saddened by what he had done. Kratos asked Athena why she would sacrifice herself. Athena replied that Zeus must live so that Olympus could prevail. She also revealed that Kratos was the child of Zeus, who was compelled to destroy his father just as Zeus had done to Cronos.\u00a0Athena's revelation confirmed that Kratos was her brother and he was a Demigod.\u00a0Sickened by that very fact and more vengeful than ever, Kratos claimed that he had no father and left Athena to die in a spectacular burst of green light. Kratos then\u00a0proclaimed that if all the Gods deny him his vengeance then they will all deserve death.Beyond Death  After he fell from Gaia's back during the Attack on Mount Olympus, Kratos wound up in the River Styx that led him into the Underworld. There, Athena, in a Ghost-Like State, appeared to Kratos, gave him the Blades of Exile and told him that in order for him to defeat Zeus, he had to venture back up the mountain and extinguish The Flame of Olympus, which he would find on the other side of Hera's Garden. Athena also informed Kratos about Pandora's Box, which he would find once he had reached the Flame. When a skeptical Kratos inquired as to her sudden change in heart, Athena explained that her death had brought about a change in her, an ascension to a level beyond that of the Gods, and how she understood more in that form than she did in the past. She stated that Zeus' death was necessary if humanity was ever to be freed, and would aid Kratos throughout his quest.  After Kratos succeeded in killing Zeus, Athena stated that it was time that mankind heard her message and insisted that Kratos give the powers of the Box back to her. Kratos however, sneered at her sentiments and cited the fact that Chaos was ravaging the world and the fact that Pandora's Box was empty. Confused at first, Athena then realized that when Kratos opened the box to defeat Ares, it unleashed all the evils that Zeus had captured and infected the Gods. Instead of drawing on the evil powers within the box as she had once thought, Kratos had in fact acquired the power of Hope, the power that Athena herself had sealed in the box, should it ever be opened again. During all that time, however, Kratos had that power buried underneath all his anger, sorrow, and guilt, and thus shielded it from everyone, including himself. Athena insisted again that Kratos return the power of Hope to her, in order to restore the world and rule it as the new Queen of Olympus. Kratos instead decided to impale himself with the Blade of Olympus and thereby release Hope to all of mankind. A horrified Athena exclaimed that mankind would not know what to do with such power, before she expressed her disappointment in Kratos. Then, after Athena removed the Blade of Olympus from his chest, she vanished, and left Kratos in a puddle of blood. It was widely assumed that Athena was infected with the evil of Greed, although it was not noticeable until after her death. Athena wasn't heard of in many years and her whereabouts were unknown for a long time.Beyond the Greek Realm  Athena appears silently before Kratos as he travels home to retrieve the Blades of Chaos. Kratos, still holding a grudge against her, demands that she gets out of his head, and she vanishes. Later, she reappears in the doorway of his house while he dons the Blades. She mocks Kratos for trying to change and declares that he is and will always be a monster. Kratos agrees, but counters that he is no longer her monster. He then walks through Athena's image, while she disappears.Personality  Of all the Gods on Mount Olympus in the God of War series, Athena was arguably the least selfish and was in fact, very noble, as was displayed not only by her deep love for her people and her horror of Ares' siege on Athens, but also her deep concern and love for the rest of humanity; as shown in God of War III, she stated that she intended to \"liberate\" mankind with the power of Hope. She also was seen loving her family - particularly her father, Zeus, deeply, and even sacrificed her own life to save him, although it is possible that she only did so to save the world, as the death of Zeus would have meant the death of Olympus, and thus the destruction of the entire world. Athena even cared greatly for Kratos: she elevated him as a God, shielded him from Olympus' wrath, guided him on his quest, and remained his closest ally in all of the games. That was possibly due to her knowledge that Kratos was her brother. But in God of War III, her motives somewhat changed. For some reason, she desired the death of Zeus and motivated Kratos's quest for vengeance. It was possible that she was affected by the evil, Greed, when Kratos opened Pandora's Box, which changed her motives to personal gain. However, she did not show any of that evil in God Of War II while she was alive. She also claimed to have had a message for humanity. It was unknown what she ultimately had in mind, but it seemed that she wished the destruction of the Olympians so that she could rebuild the world and rule mankind as its sole all-powerful God. Furthermore, according to Erin Torpey, Athena's voice actress for God of War III, she considered Athena as \"Trying to do some good to the world, but ultimately wants to take it over,\" which further lent to the possibility that she was not as benevolent as she presented herself to be. In God of War, Athena while appearing in front of Kratos as an illusion retained her greed and anger towards Kratos continuously goading him about his terrible past. Kratos at this point however now resented her and was unfazed at her illusion and coldly told her he may be a monster but was no longer her monster.Power and Abilities  As the Goddess of War and Wisdom, Athena was one of the most powerful gods on Olympus; with a large variety of abilities, she was just as powerful (if not more powerful) as Ares, her rival.Relationships Zeus  Athena\u00a0was very devoted to protecting Olympus and her father, Zeus. She was favored by Zeus among the rest of his children, which ignited the jealousy of her brother, Ares. Athena even went as far to protect Zeus from being killed by Kratos, though whether she did that\u00a0to protect the world or out of genuine love for her father was unknown. Athena\u00a0died by taking the strike meant\u00a0for Zeus\u00a0and the King of the\u00a0Gods took that opportunity to flee while he showed\u00a0no emotion for his beloved daughter\u00a0despite favoring her,\u00a0but it could be that he had already been corrupted by the evils of Pandora's Box by that point, and his fear of Kratos may have overshadowed any grief for his daughter, however he did show some remorse for her death later on in the series. After her death, something changed Athena. She claimed to see things where she didn't see before and believed that Mankind would suffer as long as Zeus lived. During the duration of the game, she did everything to help Kratos kill Zeus. Athena never revealed herself to her father, possibly so he would not attempt to stop her or inform Kratos of her questionable intentions.Kratos  Athena always was the most caring God to Kratos. That stemmed from their first meeting during the Raid on Sparta. As Olympian forces (Centaur Generals), cleared the way for Athena and Ares, they grabbed Deimos. Kratos tried to revolt, but was beaten down by Ares. It was Athena who stopped Ares that day from killing Kratos. She saved the life of her brother and showed regret for what she and Ares had to do. In his 10 years of servitude to the Gods, it was mostly Athena who told Kratos which task was asked of him. During Kratos' journey to the Sisters of Fate, she communicated with him and tried to stop him, but her warnings were ignored by him. It was also interesting to note that Athena knew that Kratos was still alive after Zeus' betrayal when all of the others had believed him to be dead. That showed that she was aware of his capabilities and continued to watch over him even after his dethronement as God of War. In return, Kratos was shown to care about Athena to a degree, since he was saddened by the fact that he stabbed her when he tried to kill Zeus, in direct contrast\u00a0to\u00a0Zeus who showed no emotion over her death, despite favoring Athena and fleeing afterwards. Kratos, on the other hand, was shown to be grieving over the lost of his dying ally (later\u00a0revealed to be his\u00a0sister) and asked her the reason for her sacrifice to which she revealed that it was to protect the world. She soon revealed Zeus' relation to Kratos (by extension herself as well), which shocked him as she tried to tell him to abandon his goal of vengeance. But despite Athena's pleas for Kratos to stop his ambition, he\u00a0ignored her\u00a0words and went on to state how he would destroy all\u00a0of the Gods who stood in his way and watched calmly as Athena died. Later on in\u00a0God of War III, when confronted by the Astral Form of Athena, Kratos defended his actions stating that\u00a0the Blade of Olympus was meant for Zeus. He was doubtful about her desire to help him, but later agreed to let her lead him to the flame. She tried to win back his trust and she did at a certain point. In his psyche, Kratos came face to face with his past sins, one of which was forgiving himself for killing Athena, which showed that he was deeply tormented for killing one of the few people (besides his family) who stood by his side no matter what. But, after Athena revealed her true intentions, he felt betrayed once more, which lead to an argument. He eventually repaid her by thwarting her plans by committing suicide and released the power that she craved the most: Hope. She was outraged and proclaimed to the dying Kratos: \"You disappoint me, Spartan.\" She then pulled out the Blade of Olympus, left the area despite the fact that her brother was slowly \"dying,\" and showed no concern for him as she disappeared. Kratos then grinned before he died. Years later, through her last interaction with Kratos, whom had ended up in the Norse world, it was seen they have never reconciled, with her having probably still consumed by the evil of Greed. She is still distraught by what he had done decades earlier, releasing the power of Hope, the now older Kratos still holding a grudge against her for previously meddling in his life and what he has suffered through his entire life by the Olympians. Kratos acknowledges her presence in an unsurprised manner, suggesting that her image has tormented him for many, many years since the events atop Olympus. Kratos ignores his sister's declarations by acknowledging while he may still be a monster, he is not her monster anymore and simply walks through her body, causing her to dissipate.Ares  Athena's relationship with her brother, Ares, was quite complex. For a while, they seemed to be able to work together as both of them were deployed by Zeus to retrieve Deimos. But even when on a mission for Olympus, they argued. It was Athena who stopped Ares from killing their half-brother during the raid. Zeus favored Athena, Ares felt betrayed, and, as he became estranged from Olympus, grew jealous of her. Ares started his plans to overthrow Olympus, something that he abandoned for a while after the death of The Furies. His jealousy led to him eventually to siege her city, Athens. It was noted that before his attack on her city, she had no intentions of having him killed. But afterwards, she never regretted his death as she considered him a threat to both Athens and Olympus.The Other Olympians  In the first installments, Athena was quite protective of her fellow Gods and spoke about them with great respect. She asked Kratos to stop angering them by pillaging their cities with his Spartan Army. But it was she who told Kratos, in her dying words, that every Olympian would be willing to put their life down in order to protect Zeus and if he proceeded, they would try to kill him. Due to her words, she actually signed the death warrant of her fellow Gods. In God of War III, she instead helped Kratos as he took out God after God and taught him how to use their weapons. In the end, it was implied that she had wanted them gone, so that she could become the monotheistic ruler of the Greek world.Trivia Gallery  See Athena/GalleryGod of War  God of War is a video game for the Sony PS2 console released on March 22, 2005. As an action-adventure game heavily influenced by Greek mythology, God of War was developed by Sony Computer Entertainment's Santa Monica division. It was very well received by critics and fans alike and was the recipient of many awards, including \"Game of the Year\" honors from the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences. IGN even named God of War the best PlayStation 2 game ever. The game is now available in the PlayStation 2's lineup of Greatest Hits. Thanks in part to the critical and commercial success of the original, a sequel titled God of War II\u00a0was released March 13, 2007. In 2007, IGN named God of War as the greatest PlayStation 2 game of all time, on their Top 25 PS2 Games list. God of War focuses heavily on bloody combat and puzzle-solving, much like Prince of Persia: Warrior Within. Kratos, the main character in the God of War series, uses an array of both weapons and magic powers to fight many different types of enemies, most of them based on creatures of Greek mythology. For the majority of enemies, Kratos can also initiate a minigame that involves precise button presses, analog spins, or button mashing, to finish off enemies with a bloody special kill. Spread all through the game, and obtainable in various ways, are red experience orbs, which allow him to level up his weapons and magic powers. He can find Gorgon Eyes and Phoenix Feathers as well, allowing him to increase his overall health and magic respectively. Throughout the story, Kratos obtains numerous weapons and powers from the various Gods of Olympus, many pertaining to classic Greek myths, such as spells like Medusa's Gaze, or weapons like the Blade of Artemis. God of War is notable for its movie-like presentation. While most epic games suffer from immersion-breaking loading screens, God of War's story mode switches seamlessly from the title screen to FMV sequences, to gameplay, and back, with very little load time. The load times are masked by prefetching the next area as the player traverses a long, relatively featureless area.Story  The story is told mostly in flashback, after being framed with a scene from the present wherein Kratos, standing atop the tallest cliff in Greece, laments how the gods have abandoned him and then proceeds to toss himself into the waters below. While the player starts the game three weeks prior to this event, Kratos' background is told by the Narrator during the game (revealed to be the Titan Gaia in God of War II). Kratos was a fearsome Spartan warrior and grew his fifty-man squad into an army of thousands via strategy, tactics, ferocity, and conquest. However, in a battle against a barbarian horde, his army was massacred, and, in a desperate measure, Kratos offered his life and service to Ares, the God of War, in exchange for Ares defeating the Barbarians. Ares, sensing the enormous power in Kratos, accepted his offer and destroyed the Barbarians. He also granted Kratos the Blades of Chaos, curved blades forged in the pits of Hades that were attached to long chains which were fused to Kratos' arms. Kratos then became Ares' servant, leading his Spartan army in conquering much of Greece. In one battle, they came across a village that worshiped Athena and put the residents to the sword, and their homes to the flame. There, Ares put Kratos into a rage driven by bloodlust, making him kill anyone standing in his way. Despite his own foreboding feelings and the warnings of the local oracle, Kratos entered the village's temple and slaughtered all within. Unfortunately, after his blood-lust cleared, he realized that his two last victims had been his own wife and daughter; Ares explained that this village had been a test of Kratos' power, severing the last of his humanity. The village Oracle cursed Kratos, binding the ashes of his dead family to his skin; this new pale coating gave rise to Kratos' new title, \"the Ghost of Sparta.\" and it made everyone in Greece fear him. Kratos renounced his service to Ares and began to wander the Earth, lamenting his deeds, while serving the other gods of Olympus for ten years. The player becomes involved in Kratos' story as he is approaching Athena's city, Athens, under siege by Ares' army. While in the Aegean Sea, Kratos's ship is attacked by Ares's forces. After impaling the massive heads of the fearsome Hydra, Kratos is approached by Athena, who wants him to stop Ares and save her city. Kratos agrees on one condition; that the gods relieve him of the nightmarish memories of his past crimes, as well as allowing him a chance at redemption. Kratos fights his way through the attacking forces to find the Oracle of Athens and learns from her that only Pandora's Box can give a mortal the power to kill a god. Unfortunately, due to the gods' fear of this power, the box is locked deep within Pandora's Temple, constructed on the back of the Titan Cronos, whom Zeus cursed to wander the Desert of Lost Souls until the sands rip the flesh from his bones. Kratos makes his way to the Temple, defeating many foes and evading the many traps built into the Temple by its crazed architect, Pathos Verdes III. He recovers Pandora's Box, but Ares senses his success, and throws a pillar from Athens to the Temple, impaling Kratos on a wall and killing him. As Kratos was pinned to the wall dying, Ares steals Pandora's box and Kratos is sent to the Underworld. However, Kratos is able to escape the Underworld with help from a mysterious gravedigger, who refers to Kratos as \"my child\". He returns to Athens, regains Pandora's Box, and confronts Ares. When Kratos proves that he isn't just a mortal, after all, Ares makes a desperate attempt to drive Kratos mad by making him relive the death of his family. Opening a portal, Ares traps Kratos in an illusion. Ares recreates the temple where Kratos slew his wife and child, along with images of Kratos's Family. Ares then creates copies of Kratos which attack his wife and child. After this fails, Ares strips the Blades of Chaos from Kratos' arms, taking back the weapons he had given him, and impales Kratos' family with them with Kratos watching in horror. Freed from his own mind but without weaponry, Kratos is at the mercy of Ares until he spots a very large metal sword, which was formerly used as an ornamental bridge inside Athens. With it, he engages, defeats and kills his former master, the God of War. After receiving the congratulations from the gods, Kratos asks Athena to remove the nightmares of his past. Athena explains that the gods can only forgive him for his sins; the nightmares, unfortunately, are permanent. Feeling abandoned by the gods, Kratos climbs back to the bluffs overlooking the Aegean Sea and, as the game comes full circle, tosses himself over the edge. However, as he breaks the waves below, he is pulled out by Athena. He has served the gods well, she explains, and there is a throne waiting for him that currently has no occupant: the throne of the God of War. Kratos makes his way to Olympus through a mysterious portal and claims the throne of The God of War.Characters Enemies Common Enemies Bosses Items and abilities Weapons Magic Relics Treasures  The game contains three unlockable cut scenes which are intended as potential avenues of continuing the story. These cutscenes are \"Birth of the Beast\", \"A Secret Revealed\", and \"The Fate of the Titan\". Additional costumes for Kratos are also unlocked by beating the Challenge of the Gods. Other features unlocked upon beating the game and doing certain tasks are documentaries surrounding the game's creation (like Deleted Levels) and secret messages from Kratos himself. In God of War soundtrack, \"God of War End Title\" by Ron Fish, there is a secret message around 4:29, where Kratos questions himself about his brother's return.Costumes Cast Critical Reception  God of War received strong praise from gaming critics and is widely considered one of the best PlayStation 2 games of all-time. The game was praised for its strong gameplay, graphics, and sound. A CNN review stated that God of War is the type of game that makes you remember why you play games in the first place. Reviews did find that some of the puzzle and platforming aspects, particularly while escaping Hades, were not as strong as the rest of the game.Trivia Sequel  Due to its success, a sequel was released on the PS2 (God of War II). Later, three interquels were released; two on the PSP titled God of War: Chains of Olympus, and God of War: Ghost of Sparta, as well as game for cell phones, God of War: Betrayal. The very-anticipated God of War III released on the PS3, ending the God of War trilogy. A prequel to the entire series, God of War: Ascension was released also on the PS3.Game Series Main Entries Handheld Consoles Mobile Phones Other Media Gallery:  God of War/GalleryExternal links God of War: Ghost of Sparta  God of War: Ghost of Sparta is the sixth installment of the God of War series, originally released on the PlayStation Portable and the PSP Go. It was later released along with God of War: Chains of Olympus on the PlayStation 3 as part of the God of War: Origins Collection. The story is set between God of War and God of War II and has Kratos visiting the long-lost city of Atlantis and also details more about his past, which he seeks to unravel and also learns that his long-lost mother and brother Deimos are alive.Story  The Oracle foretold that the demise of Olympus would come not from the Titans; but by a\u00a0Marked Warrior, a mortal. The Olympian Gods Zeus and Ares believed this warrior to be Deimos, brother of Kratos, due to his strange birthmarks. Ares sieges a village of Sparta and interrupts the childhood training of Kratos and Deimos, with Athena on hand to watch over him, and kidnaps Deimos. Kratos attempts to stop Ares but is swept aside and scarred across his right eye by the violent Olympian. Ares prepares to kill the young Kratos for attacking him. Athena stops Ares and tells him they only came for the Marked Warrior, not to take the boy's life. Taken to the Domain of Death, Deimos is imprisoned and tortured by the God of Death, Thanatos. Years later, Kratos, the Ghost of Sparta, has defeated and killed Ares and taken his place as the new God of War on Mount Olympus. Still haunted by visions of his mortal past, Kratos decides - against the advice of the Goddess Athena - to explore his past and travels to the Temple of Poseidon, located within the city of Atlantis. Despite Poseidon's best efforts to prevent Kratos from reaching his city, including sending the monster Scylla, Kratos reaches Atlantis. After a series of confrontations, Kratos kills Scylla. Kratos eventually locates his ailing mother, Callisto, who attempts to reveal to him the identity of his father. Kratos only hears very weak and faint noises, but she manages to tell him that his brother is alive and tormented in Death's Domain, but that he first needs to go to Ares' temple in Sparta. When Callisto is suddenly transformed into a hideous beast, Kratos is forced to battle her. Before dying, Callisto thanks Kratos and beseeches him to seek out his brother Deimos. He also encounters and frees the trapped Titan Thera, which causes a flood that destroys Atlantis. In his journey to Sparta, he also meets the Grave Digger again, who warns him not to alienate the Gods.\u00a0 While traveling through the Aronia Pass, Kratos meets Erinys, Thanatos' daughter. He fights and kills Erinys, and arrives in Sparta where he is praised by the people. While on his way to the Temple of Ares he witnesses a group of Spartans, led by the Last Spartan, tearing down a statue of Ares to replace it with one of Kratos. Kratos then goes to the Jails of Sparta where he chases a dissenter loyal to Ares who tries to kill Kratos by releasing the Piraeus Lion. However, Kratos fights and kills both foes. He returns to the Temple of Ares and after an encounter with a ghost-like form of his younger self, he learns he must return to Atlantis and find Death's Domain. Kratos then accepts his former weapons, the Arms of Sparta, as a gift from the Last Spartan, and departs. After Kratos leaves Sparta, he returns to Atlantis but when his ship draws closer to the sunken city, minions of Poseidon sink Kratos' ship and kill the crew. After nearly drowning, a statue of Poseidon possessed by the Sea God himself tells the Spartan he will pay for sinking his kingdom and he will not forget this event. Kratos then traverses through the city's ruin and eventually locates the Gateway to Death's Domain. Entering Death's Domain, Kratos eventually locates and frees his imprisoned brother Deimos. Enraged with Kratos' failure to rescue him sooner, Deimos says he will never forgive Kratos, and attacks him, only to have Thanatos intervene. Taking Deimos to the Suicide Bluffs, Deimos almost falls off the cliff. Kratos saves his brother, and the two reconcile. After giving Deimos the Arms of Sparta, Kratos and Deimos fight Thanatos together. During the fight, Thanatos transforms into a black monster and kills Deimos, but is then destroyed by an enraged Kratos. Kratos then carries the body of his fallen brother up the mountain where he the enigmatic Grave Digger (who already had a grave prepared) buries Deimos, with Kratos using the Arms of Sparta as a grave marker. The Ghost of Sparta then goes to the Suicide Bluffs where, after briefly pondering suicide, he asks himself \"By the gods, what have I become?\" The Gravedigger responds that he has become \"Death...the Destroyer of Worlds.\" Kratos turns to look at the Grave Digger who has disappeared just as Athena comes out of the portal. She tells him that his ties to the mortal world are now severed and he is ready to become a God. Athena attempts to elevate Kratos to full Godhood only to have the Spartan stop her from doing so. Kratos then returns to Olympus stating the gods will pay for what they have done. As Kratos returns, Athena quietly asks \"Forgive me...brother\", marking the first time Athena acknowledges they are siblings. In a post-credits scene, the Grave Digger is shown laying Callisto to her grave, saying \"Now, only one remains.\" A third grave is seen, implied to have been dug for Kratos. The scene shifts to Kratos on his throne, wearing his newly-forged armor, furious and determined to exact vengeance on the Gods. (It is widely assumed that this leads up to the beginning of God of War II, as Kratos, driven by the rage of the loss of his brother and mother, leads the Spartans into a vicious battle to take over the city of Rhodes. Zeus, who has been poisoned uncontrollably with Fear after witnessing Kratos murder the God of Death, later tricks Kratos and kills him, fulfilling his statement that he was going to kill the remaining person in the family he should have never made.)Characters Enemies Common Enemies Bosses Items and Abilities Weapons Magic Items Relics of the Gods  These items grant bonuses in bonus play if activated.Bonus Costumes Cut Content  Dana Jan stated that fans wanted a \"female version\" of Kratos.

The costume never made it to the final publication.Cast Reception  God of War: Ghost of Sparta has received generally positive acclaim from various media outlets. IGN gave it a 9.5/10, and stated the graphics are \"better than a big chunk of PS2 games\" and that it is the \"best-looking game on the PSP thus far.\" In terms of gameplay, \"there's nothing unique here, but that's not a bad thing.\" PlayStation: The Official Magazine gave it a 10/10, saying \"Ghost of Sparta offers an immersive experience on par with many of the best PS3 games.\" 1UP gave it an A-, claiming the game is \"a more personal story than the other GOW games, but one that still features the series' signature trademarks,\" also calling the sex mini-game \"arguably the most over-the-top of the bunch.\" Eurogamer awarded the game a 7/10, saying the \"game's primary problem...is in its in-built focus. The God of War series... is principally concerned with endlessly upping the ante. The battle system is strong, but nothing without the world and set-pieces it drives. There is a sense that Ghost of Sparta is a step back for the series if you've played the PlayStation 3 game. The set-pieces, while incredible within the context of this handheld platform, seem tired when set against, for example, the opening scenes of God of War III. And when you take away the sense of wonder in a God of War game, the remaining components struggle to carry the experience.\" Eurogamer also states the game is \"best enjoyed by newcomers\" or \"those yet to play\" God of War III. Game Informer gave the game a 9.5, staying that in terms of gameplay, \"the other core fighting mechanics are familiar, but the tweaks go a long way toward improving gameplay.\" They also said that \"Ghost of Sparta doesn\u2019t have any mind-blowing moments\" but \"this isn\u2019t an optional side-story; Ghost of Sparta is a must-play for God of War fans.\"Trivia Video Trailers Cutscenes Related Pages Deimos  Deimos was the younger brother of Kratos. He was abducted by Ares during his childhood to avert a prophecy about the destruction of Mount Olympus. He was then tortured by Thanatos, God of Death for years in the Domain of Death. After he came of age in the Domain of Death, Deimos was fueled by hatred for the brother who had failed to save him from his torment. After Deimos was rescued by Kratos, and still held initial resentment toward him, he ultimately reconciled with his brother and joined forces with him to battle Thanatos only to be killed by the Death God. That was not unavenged, however, as Kratos killed Thanatos shortly after. His death was the final straw which lead to Kratos snapping at the gods and vowing to kill them.Greek Mythology  In Greek Mythology, Deimos (Ancient Greek: \u0394\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2, pronounced [d\u00ea\u02d0mos], meaning \"dread\") was the personification of terror. He was the son of Ares and Aphrodite. He was the twin brother of Phobos and the Goddess, Enyo, who accompanied Ares into battle, as well as his father's attendants: Trembling, Fear, Dread and Panic. Deimos was more of a personification and an abstraction of the sheer terror that was brought by war and he never appeared as an actual character in any story in Greek Mythology. His Roman equivalent was Formido or Metus.God of War Series Early Life  Deimos was born a few years after Kratos, and bore a remarkable birthmark across his body. The two brothers grew up together under the watchful eye of their mother, Callisto, in Sparta, with dreams of joining the Spartan Army when they were older. Kratos and Deimos trained with the traditional spear and shield throughout their childhood, with Kratos teaching the young Deimos to remember that: \"a Spartan never lets his back hit the ground.\"The Marked One Prophecy  Long ago, the\u00a0Oracle foretold the destruction of the Olympians at the hands of The Marked Warrior. Due to his unusual birthmark, the Gods feared that Deimos would be the prophesied warrior, so, they devised a plan to abduct him from his family so that the Oracle's prophecy couldn't come to pass. One fateful day, Ares and Athena descended onto Sparta to take Deimos and unleashed an army of Centaurs to decimate the populace while they searched for him. They quickly found the young Deimos amidst the chaos and took him while he trained with Kratos, though his brother attempted to stop Ares. Kratos lunged at Ares to keep him from taking his brother, but Ares struck him down, which scarred him over his right eye. Ares then attempted to kill Kratos, but Athena quickly told him not to, as they already had who they were looking for. Ares then disappeared in a cloud of fire. Athena apologized to Kratos, then disappeared in a cloud of fire as well. Ares brought Deimos to Thanatos in the Domain of Death to remain there in torment, to ensure that the prophecy of \"The Marked One\" would never occur. For several years, Deimos believed that Kratos would come to his rescue. As time passed, Deimos' hope began to fade, and was replaced with hatred for the brother who had left him to rot.God of War: Ghost of Sparta  After he met - and defeated - Callisto in Atlantis, Kratos was compelled to find his brother at any cost. After he undertook a perilous journey that took him across Greece, Kratos finally found Deimos deep in the Temple of Thanatos, suspended from a tree. Freed from his chains, save for a single massive Gauntlet that was locked around his right arm, Deimos wanted revenge against Kratos for not protecting him and quickly assaulted his brother. Deimos was instead interrupted, as Thanatos arrived grabbed Deimos and took him to Suicide Bluffs to throw him off the edge. Kratos, barely able to stand, managed to follow them to Suicide Bluffs. Locked in combat, Deimos and Thanatos never saw Kratos arrive, Thanatos managed to nearly throw Deimos off the cliff until Kratos raced to his aid. Rushing over to his brother, and barely saving him from certain death, Kratos proclaimed never to leave Deimos again, and gave Deimos the Arms of Sparta. Joining forces, side by side, as brothers, Deimos and Kratos began their attack on Thanatos. Together, the pair followed Thanatos along the cliffs and eventually caught up with him, where Thanatos stated that Ares had chosen poorly, where he should have opted for Kratos instead of Deimos, all those years ago. He then said that it didn't matter anymore, that nothing Kratos does is of his own choosing. Kratos shouted that no one, not even the gods decide his fate to which Thanatos responded that the gods decide and the Sisters of Fate make it so and that Kratos was nothing but a pawn in a game he didn't even know was being played. The Spartan Brothers charged at Thanatos, and fought the God of Death together, until Thanatos transformed into a gigantic winged monster, grabbed Deimos, and crushed him against the cliff side, which effectively killed him. Kratos, fueled by extreme rage, unleashed Thera's Bane at an unhuman level and defeated Thanatos, avenging his brother's death. Kratos carried Deimos' lifeless body to the top of Suicide Bluffs via the Path of Solitude, where the Grave Digger had prepared a grave for Deimos next to that of their mother's grave. He then lain Deimos' body into the grave and stated that Deimos was free. Kratos also made a promise to Athena that the Gods would pay for what they did to his brother and mother.God of War III  Kratos discovered several notes spread around the Underworld, with one seemingly written by his mother. The note claimed that all who got close to her son died, which included his own brother. At the end of God of War III, Gaia confronted Zeus and Kratos and admitted regret in helping him. Zeus claimed that since Kratos had failed her, she: \"should have chosen the other one\". In Ghost of Sparta, the Grave Digger (Zeus), referenced Deimos as \"the other one\", which indicated that it was Deimos that Gaia should have chosen. Kratos was then visibly\u00a0angered by Zeus' statement. Also, when in his Psyche, Kratos came across a pool of blood. After waiting a bit, a pair of interesting dialogues could be heard, when a male voice spoke out and said: Though only his voice was heard in the game, there was concept art that was made of Deimos. Deimos final Concept Art was instead used for God of War: Ghost of Sparta instead of God of War III. A Deimos Bonus Costume could be unlocked after the game was completed; however, it could only be obtained by inputting a special code that was included in a limited number of God of War: Ghost of Sparta games or by buying it online within the first week of release. It was included with God of War III: Remastered.Personality  Unlike his brother Kratos, Deimos was far more softhearted and kind. Despite that, he greatly respected and loved his sibling and would always train with him to learn how to fight. However, after being separated from his family and enduring physical and psychological torture by Thanatos; Deimos became much more aggressive and warlike, just like his brother. Nevertheless, he still held a degree of compassion and care for Kratos despite his initial resentment and what had occurred, as illustrated by their reconciliation and shared goal to stop Thanatos.Weapons and Powers  Deimos was an incredibly powerful Mortal as he was able to best Kratos, a skilled warrior and a God at the time in single combat, armed with only a gauntlet (although Kratos did not fight Deimos in full potential because he would have caused serious damage to him). For that reason, it was presumed that it was because of his Demigod attributes from his being a son of Zeus, just like his brother. Deimos was also extremely proficient with the Arms of Sparta as he wielded them to great effect in the fight against Thanatos. He had incredible strength as seen from being able to overpower Kratos. It might be possible that Deimos was able to overpower him because Kratos had let him win, as seen in the remastered PS3 version, the player got a Trophy that was called \"Let Him Win\", but it was also necessary to consider that during both fights, Deimos had endured enormous physical and psychological torture because of the years he spent in the Domain of Death and his suffering at the hands of Thanatos.Video Trivia Hercules  Hercules was the son of Zeus and half-brother to Kratos. As a mortal, he was tasked with 12 labors in order to gain redemption for the murder of his family. Being called to Olympus in order to defend it with the Gods, Hercules would consider it his 13th and final labor to rid Olympus of Kratos once and for all.Greek Mythology  In Greek mythology, Heracles/Hercules was the Demigod son of Zeus and a mortal woman named Alcmene, who is the granddaughter of Perseus. Heracles was blessed with unnatural strength from birth. He was outright hated by Zeus' wife, Hera, who drove him to madness as he grew into adulthood. This god-driven madness led him to commit the murder of his wife, Megara, and his two sons Seeking atonement for his atrocious deed, King Eurystheus assigned Heracles to perform ten labors, but cheated him into doing two more. Heracles, however, had finished all these labors (mainly using his strength) and found redemption. Heracles had many more adventures, but was ultimately killed by his own wife Deianara (albeit unintentionally), ascending to Olympus as he died. He also appears in other stories, for example, as he was one of Jason's Argonauts.In the God of War Series  Hercules is the\u00a0older half-brother of Kratos, and shares many similarities with him. Both warriors mercilessly killed their wife and children under the influence of gods (Hera for Hercules; Ares for Kratos), having been forced to serve Olympus for a number of years in order to hopefully gain redemption. Both are also demigods, being the sons of Zeus. Their rage is also uncontrollable, leading to moments where they become blinded by bloodlust. Some of Kratos' moves with the Blades of Chaos are named after Hercules (Spirit of Hercules, Valor of Hercules, and Might of Hercules). There is also a bonus costume of Hercules that can be unlocked in God of War II.In God of War III  Hercules is first seen taking orders from his father to attack the invading Titans. He then commands a large group of Olympus Sentries to jump off Olympus and attack the Titans, landing on Gaia's arm to attack Kratos. When Kratos later encounters Hera in the Arena, she has Hercules fight Kratos as her champion. There, Hercules reveals how he believes Zeus considers Kratos his favorite as Kratos was the one assigned to kill Ares while Hercules was cleaning the Augean stables. Growing even more jealous when Kratos was being crowned the God of War, while Hercules was instructed to steal the Apples of the Hesperides. Although he had taken enjoyment out of slaying the Nemean Lion, Zeus made Kratos' story more famous across the world. He then reveals how he plans to destroy Kratos as his thirteenth, unofficial and final labor, becoming the God of War himself. Kratos attempts to reason with his half-brother, saying that Zeus has no favorites and that even though Hercules wants to be an Olympian, their reign will end, but Hercules does not listen, telling Kratos, \"We'll see about that.\" After Kratos kills all of his undead soldiers, Hercules decides to fight him himself using the Nemean Cestus, throwing off the soldiers who brought and armed him with these weapons into the arena. At a point of the fight, Kratos stabs Hercules in the arm and takes the pair of Cesti one by one. Hercules then fights Kratos unarmed, which he considered a real challenge. After a long and fierce fight, Hercules lifts the floor of the arena making Kratos almost fall, but he uses the spikes on the Cestus to claw his way back up. Kratos pounds on the arena floor with the Cestus, causing it to fall on Hercules, trapping him. Taking advantage of Hercules' predicament, Kratos brutally beats Hercules to death with the Nemean Cestus, staving his head in and smashing the arena floor. Both Kratos and Hercules, the latter now dead and gruesomely disfigured, tumble into the sewers below, where Kratos leaves his brother's body to rot. Before leaving, Kratos can take Hercules' shoulder guard.Multiplayer  The Forum\u00a0where Kratos fought his half brother returns in Ascension\u00a0as one of the multiplayer maps. Hercules is featured in this level. At the beginning of each match, he is seen putting his Cestus on with the help of a pair of satyrs\u00a0and then punching them away, much like the way he did in God of War III with a pair of Olympus Sentries. Hercules watches the players fighting below him, but interferes occasionally: he jumps down to the floor sometimes, pounding the ground with the Cestus and creating a blue shockwave that pushes the players to the edge of the Arena. If not jumped properly, these shockwaves will damage players and push them away. Each wave also destroys a part of the board of the Arena, which allows players to throw each other to death in these open spaces. In the Trial of the Gods mode, Hercules role is extended: he not only creates the blue shockwaves mentioned above, but also acts as the boss of the Arena map in this mode. In the third round of the Trial, Hercules jumps down to the battlefield to fight the players with other monsters. He uses the same attacks of God of War III. After taking enough damage, he runs back to the bleachers and continues to watch over the match. In the last round of the Trial, he jumps down to fight the players once again. This time, he loses his armor after being weakened and them claps the Cesti together, destroying them and damaging near warriors as well. He continues to fight them by grabbing and punching them, exactly like he fights in the third once again. After weakening him for the last time, a red halo will appear above Hercules' head. When he is grabbed, the player(s) will push him to the ground and punch him continuously, one hitting his face and the other one, if present, his chest. The camera angles continuously changes, which also resembles much his death in the third game. After many punches, the player(s) will win the match, but won't stop hitting Hercules. Hercules is most likely left unconscious rather than being killed by the players, since his definitive death occurs in God of War III. His defeat, however, is a great act already.Personality  Hercules is an extremely prideful and fast to rage individual, despite this, he shows to greatly respect the gods, principaly his father, Zeus, who he is always trying to impress. Because of his obsession to impress Zeus, and his pride, Hercules is also extremely jealous of his younger brother, Kratos, as he believes that Kratos is Zeus's favorite son, and that Kratos had been offered greater glory than Hercules could ever achieve, while finishing his 'twelve labors', whose, according to Hercules, were just minor tasks when compared to everything Kratos have done. Hercules is determined to destroy Kratos, and claim the throne as the new 'god of war\" among the olympians.Powers and Abilities  Hercules was considered the most powerful hero and Demigod in existence. Hercules possessed a wide variety of godly powers that include:Relationships Kratos  Kratos was Hercules' half-brother and arch-enemy. When Hercules was infected with the evil of Envy released from Pandora's Box, he felt irrational jealousy towards his brother, despising how Kratos was their father's perceived favorite. He was also jealous of Kratos being crowned the God of War, being sent to kill Ares while he was stuck doing his twelve labors, such as \"cleaning\" the Augean Stables and being sent to steal the Apples of Hesperides, holding the Earth upon his shoulders as Atlas retrieved the Apples but tricked him into taking back the burden, and having his name renowned throughout the land while Hercules was not nearly as famous as his brother. During the Second Great War, Hercules fought Kratos in the Forum on Hera's orders and tried to kill him. After a long and brutal battle, Hercules was slaughtered when Kratos took the Nemean Cestus and beat him to death.Zeus  Zeus was Hercules' father. Hercules was completely loyal to Zeus, and was willing to give his life to serve him. In return, Zeus trusted Hercules very much, and gave him high authority over the armies of Olympus. Hercules was determined to stay in his father's favor, and so felt that he was looked down upon by Zeus while Kratos was crowned the God of War by the King of Olympus. Hercules led the armies of Olympus during the Second Titan-God War, but was killed by Kratos, a loss which Zeus showed little remorse for. This was his 13th and final labour to kill Kratos.Hera  The wife of Zeus always hated Hercules for being another bastard son of her husband. Because of this hate, she tried to kill Hercules in several parts of his life, which includes creating his famous Twelve Labors. Hera's anger grew stronger as the bastard son of Zeus accomplished all the suicide missions she invented to him and became even more famous for escaping death so many times. While Hercules had this same hate for Hera, the evil Envy seems to have blinded him completely: the demigod seems to have completely forgotten his rivalry with his StepMother/ Aunt and her desire to see him dead to turn his attention to Kratos. While his cooperation with Hera to do anything - even killing a common enemy - \u00a0is highly unlikely and untrustable, it is probable that Hera herself has persuaded Hercules to see Kratos as a personal rival and to fight him to death, because this new strategy would lead to the death of at least one of the two men Hera hated most in the world: Kratos and Hercules.Trivia Helios  Helios is the Titan God of The Sun and Guardian of Oaths. He is a minor and background character in God of War: Chains of Olympus and a major antagonist in God of War III. Helios is one of the strongest Gods, since he is the sun itself. He is only surpassed by Poseidon, Hades, Zeus and Ares.In Greek Mythology  In Greek mythology, the Sun was personified as Helios. Helios was the All-Seeing God of the sun and was called upon witness when needed by the Gods. He was a son of the Titan Hyperion and Theia, brother of the Goddesses Selene, the Moon, and Eos, the Dawn and the father of Circe, goddess of magic. The names of these three were also the common Greek words for Sun, Dawn and Moon. Helios was imagined as a handsome God crowned with the shining aureole of the sun, who drove the Sun Chariot across the sky each day to earth-circling Oceanus and through the world-ocean returned to the East at night. Homer described Helios's chariot as drawn by his Fire Steeds. Still later, the horses were given fiery names: Pyrois, Aeos, Aethon, and Phlegon. Although born a Titan, Helios is never depicted in the gigantic form of his parents. As time passed, Helios was increasingly identified with the God of Light, Apollo, but the two remained separate beings. Helios' mythological Roman equivalent is Sol.In the God of War Series The First Titanomachy  In Atlas' flashback of the Great War of the Gods and the Titans, Helios can be seen fighting alongside Hermes against the Titans.Wager with the Gods  Helios appeared in the gods' wager, with a champion of his own. Although endowed with powers similar to Helios' own, his champion was killed in battle by Kratos.Helios' Abduction  Helios was kidnapped by the mighty Titan by orders of the goddess Persephone, who felt betrayed by the Gods for being forced to stay with her husband Hades, God of the Underworld, six months out of every year. His disappearance allowed Morpheus, the God of Dreams, who had been alerted of Persephone's plan, to take over the mortal realm and cast the Gods into a deep slumber. Helios was taken to the Underworld, where Atlas tried to use his power to destroy the Pillar of the World-and with it, the rest of the world and Mount Olympus (the home of the Olympian Gods). Before this plan could be fully achieved, Helios was saved by Kratos, who defeated Persephone and chained Atlas to the world in the Pillar's place. During the battle with Persephone, Helios was held in Atlas' hand, forming of an orb of light. The ray of sunlight he radiated was used by Kratos to weaken Persephone. After his final battle and Kratos returning Helios to the sky but fell off Helios' Chariot and nearly hit a cliff, though he was saved by the gods. On the cliffs, an unconscious Kratos was stripped of his items by Helios and Athena. Helios, praised his actions and grateful for Kratos' rescuing him, showed pity for his sacrifices, suggesting helping him further, only for Athena to disagree, claiming that \"He'll live. They must.\"Further Appearances  While Helios does not appear in person in Ascension, God of War, Ghost of Sparta or God of War II (save the ending cutscene), technically he is always visible whenever the Sun is in the sky. Two statues of the Sun God do appear in God of War II. The first is the great Colossus of Rhodes, which, after being brought to life by Zeus, Kratos fought and destroyed. The second was found in the Garden of the Gods, as Kratos traveled through the Palace of the Fates. Helios briefly appears in person at the end, during the council of the Gods on Olympus, along with Hermes, Hades, Poseidon and Zeus. He is one of the first witnesses of the rescued Titans ascending Mount Olympus, led by Gaia and Kratos, who wanted revenge on Zeus for betraying him.The Second Titanomachy  The Gods quickly took action to defeat the Titans once again. Helios jumped onto his Sun Chariot and began attacking Gaia, throwing a fireball, combusting a fallen tree to prevent Kratos from escaping the undead soldiers that swarmed the Titaness' shoulder. Afterwards, Helios was also seen battling the Titan of Destruction, Perses, and successfully dislodged him off the mountain. Helios again confronted Perses on the slopes of Olympia, holding an advantage over the Titan because of the blinding light he emitted. He occasionally aided the minions of Olympus fighting Kratos, throwing fireballs into the area. After having fought his way through the hordes, Kratos used a ballista to damage Helios' Sun Chariot, causing him to fly straight into Perses' hand. Perses then crushed Helios with his Chariot, and threw him far into the city. After traveling through the ruined city, Kratos discovers Helios once again; severely injured from the crash and unable to lift himself off the ground. A battalion of Olympus Sentinels converged on the wounded Helios, forming a shield that Kratos could not damage due to their Onyx shields. Kratos managed to break their shields by taking control of a Cyclops which had also arrived to assist Helios, using its club to batter through their defenses before ripping the Cyclops' eye socket out and killing it.Death  Helios, pleading for his life, reminded Kratos of the debt he owed the mortal for saving him from Atlas years ago (in Chains of Olympus), and promised to repay Kratos if his life was to be spared as his life was spared from Atlas by Kratos. Kratos immediately demanded the location of The Flame of Olympus. Helios stated he would never reach it or kill Zeus and that he would forfeit his life trying; to which Kratos replied that his life is not the one Helios should worry about. Helios subsequently unleashed the power of the sun, in an attempt to blind Kratos. Kratos however, was able to block the light with his hands, slowly advancing towards the Sun God. When he got within range, Kratos began violently stomping his head, after which Helios begged him to stop. Helios told Kratos that he would have to bathe in the Flames of Olympus in order to obtain its power. Kratos immediately knew he was lying, yelling that Hephaestus told him that the Flame would kill all who touched it. Helios tried to defend himself stating that Hephaestus was lying, as the \"freak\" had fallen from the graces of Olympus; Kratos retorted that it was why he believed the Smith God. Failing to convince Kratos, and with a final gaze at the Spartan, Helios sternly told Kratos his death would not lead him to Zeus, only for Kratos to reply that is where he was wrong. Kratos then grabbed his head, and started to pull it fiercely, Kratos then, delivered a powerful hit on Helios's neck, breaking it, and then grabbed the Sun God's head again and started to pull it with all his might, Helios screamed in pain as Kratos brutally tore off his head, killing him. Helios's severed head screamed in pain and anger as Kratos observed it. With the Sun God's death, clouds blocked the sun, bringing darkness and storms permanently across the world. Kratos would then use the late god's head to discover several secrets, blind enemies, and unlocking new paths throughout Olympus, as well as the Underworld. In the final battle against Zeus, the Sun God's head, while undamaged, has its light dimmed when Zeus destroyed Kratos' equipment except for the Boots of Hermes, the Blades of Exile and the Blade of Olympus.Personality  Helios was very proud of his status as \"god of the sun\", as he was the one keeping external threats, such as Morpheus, away from Olympus. He also shows an honorable side, as he wanted to compensate Kratos for saving him from Atlas. However, after being consumed by the evils of the Pandora's box, Helios became arrogant and manipulative, as when he tried to manipulate Kratos into touching the Flames of Olympus, and called Hephaestus a \"freak\" who was cast aside.Powers and abilities  As the God of the Sun and easily one of the most important deities in the Greek Pantheon, Helios is implied to be an incredible force to be reckoned with. He may have presumably possessed all of the standard abilities of a god, including immortality, enhanced physical abilities, and great endurance, however as a natural born Titan he presumably possess greater abilities. Although while this may indeed be the case, Helios himself does not receive an opportunity to display many of these traits, as his appearances in God of War III were rather brief and did not involve any scuffles with Kratos. However, out of all the abilities he apparently possessed, quite possibly the most prominent attribute displayed by Helios is immense physical durability, as he was shown to have been able to survive being both crushed in Perses' fist and even thrown at presumably high speeds into a mountainside (although he did suffer from some injuries as a result of this). This proves that Helios, at full strength, was a truly powerful opponent to face and would have most likely put up a rather impressive fight should he have had the opportunity to face the Ghost of Sparta in a more proper setting where the odds would have been more evenly matched. In addition to his physical attributes, Helios, being the sun god, naturally has control over different aspects of the sun, such as fire or more specifically sunlight; He was shown to be able to hurl massive blasts of light at his foes that would explode in fiery glory that proved to be very effective when he is seen battling Perses at different points in the game. He also displays the ability to unleash an incredibly bright light from his body which he could use to utterly blind his enemies and even illumine even the most darkest of places (as demonstrated by Kratos using his decapitated head as a makeshift lantern). His solar powers are so strong that they can even forcefully banish Nyx, a Primordial Goddess. In addition to all of his primary powers and abilities, Helios also possessed an immense flying chariot with flaming horses that he would ride with very masterful skill into battle at great speeds. He was also in possession of his trademark Sun Shield\u00a0(worn on his left forearm), which he could use to deflect any oncoming attacks. Since he is the literal aspect of the sun, should Helios be destroyed or abducted, this would cause the sun to be blocked out by heavy rainclouds and violent storms and even disappear entirely (as shown by his death at the hands of Kratos and his abduction in Chains Of Olympus).Trivia Related Pages Blade of Olympus  The Blade of Olympus was a powerful weapon that was seen in God of War: Ghost of Sparta, God of War II and God of War III. It was created by Zeus (who forged it from the Heavens and the Earth) during the end of the\u00a0Great War in order to banish the Titans to Tartarus, which ended the brutal war once and for all.History  The weapon was created in the First Titanomachy by Zeus as means to end the war. After the defeat of Atlas, Zeus returned to the battlefield and wielded his new weapon. He pushed the Blade into the Earth and chanted that he banished the Titans to the depths of Tartarus. That created a huge vortex that engulfed the battlefield, but sent only the Titans to Tartarus where they remained chained until Kratos freed them. That weapon was first used in Rhodes, when Zeus sent it down for Kratos to help him destroy the Colossus of Rhodes. Unknown to Kratos, Zeus had tricked him into draining all of his Godly Powers into it, which supposedly gave Kratos the \"strength to destroy all who oppose the Gods.\" But, as the collapsing Colossus of Rhodes' Hand crashed down on Kratos, it appeared that he was severely weakened by giving his power to the Blade. Bloodied and beaten, Kratos tried to regain the Blade, only Zeus arrived and retrieved it, and thus prevented Kratos from regaining his powers. Zeus then shoved the blade into Kratos's abdomen, which brought him to the verge of death, and sent him to the Underworld. Later, Kratos regained the Blade of Olympus after he went back through time and with it, he fought and nearly killed Zeus on the Summit of Sacrifice. Kratos, who intended to thrust the Blade through Zeus' chest, invoked Athena's interference, and killed her instead of Zeus. When starting another game on Bonus Play, the Blade could then be used for the entire game. From there, you could level it up to increase its power and gain new abilities for it. The Blade of Olympus also appeared in God of War III, as part of the magic ability of the Blades of Athena (Divine Reckoning). Kratos planted the Blade on top of Gaia's back during the Titans' siege of Mount Olympus. When both he and Gaia were thrown off of Olympus, Kratos wedged it into Gaia in an attempt to hold on, but both he and the Blade fell into the Underworld. Later, when Kratos retrieved the Blade from a Statue of Pandora in the depths of Hades, he was able to use it as a part of the Rage of Sparta. The Rage of Sparta was the only means by which he used the Blade of Olympus. Nonetheless, the Blade proved quite useful and strong in defeating some of the major opponents that were encountered over the course of the game. It was used to slay Cronos and Perses as Kratos journeyed through the Underworld and Olympus, and in the final battle, it was used to kill both Zeus and Gaia. In the very end, Kratos ultimately used the Blade to stab himself, and thus, released the power of Hope that dwelt within him, as well as the power within the Blade itself, which was rendered useless. The blade was apparently abandoned following Kratos' disappearance from Olympus.God of War: Ascension  See The Blade of Olympus (Multiplayer)Appearance  The Blade of Olympus was a large golden and white metal sword with bluish hues of energy that brimmed through and around it.Powers & Abilities  The very powerful weapon (magically forged from both the heavens, the seas, the afterlife & the earth) that ended the Great War and banished the Titans to Tartarus, it was likely the most powerful weapon in the Series, unlike any other weapon. It possessed incredible Godly Powers, which allowed those who wielded it to kill Deities or those who were infused with Godly Might, as Kratos used it to slay the Colossus of Rhodes, Athena,\u00a0Perses,\u00a0Cronos, Zeus, and Gaia. The Blade could also release blasts of energy that were powerful enough to destroy armies in one swing. However, it appeared that the Blade required an infusion of Godly Power in order for its potential to be truly unleashed, though it's not entirely clear if it really needed that energy or if Zeus simply claimed so in order to weaken Kratos as much as possible.\u00a0In addition, it appeared that the Blade of Olympus was akin to Zeus' Thunderbolt, as it was the most powerful weapon in the world, and it, rather than the iconic Lightning Bolt, was seen with Zeus in most Statues.Combos (God of War II) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Combos (God of War III) Combos (God of War: Ghost of Sparta) Trivia God of War III  Pages related to God of War III.God of War: Chains of Olympus  God of War: Chains of Olympus for PSP is a video game developed by Ready at Dawn Studios in 2008. It was the first game in the series to be released for the PSP, the second being Ghost of Sparta. It is a prequel to the video game God of War and takes place after God of War: Ascension. The game takes place in the period in which Kratos served the Gods of Olympus for ten years. Over the years, Kratos had to complete several goals in order to achieve redemption for the nightmares that haunt him.Gameplay  Kratos, the main character in the God of War series, uses an array of both weapons and magic powers to fight a variety of enemies, with most of them based on monsters of Greek myth. All throughout the game, Kratos can find red experience orbs which allow him to level up his weapons and magic powers, as well as Gorgon Eyes and Phoenix Feathers that allow him to increase his health and magic meters. Throughout the story of the game, Kratos obtains numerous weapons and powers from the various Gods of Olympus, with many of them pertaining to\u00a0classic Greek myth.Story  Set halfway through Kratos' ten years servitude to the Gods, Chains of Olympus begins with Kratos being dispatched to the city of Attica to help defend it from the invading Persian army. Soon after his arrival, the Spartan spots a basilisk climbing over the city walls and gives chase. During his chase, Kratos confronts the Persian King inside the city and kills him. Taking the King's power to summon the Efreet, he then encounters the basilisk and kills it. After defeating the basilisk, he witnesses the sun fall from the sky, plunging the world in darkness. Following the dim remaining light on the horizon, Kratos fights his way through the city of Marathon, along the way encountering the black fog of Morpheus, which now covers the land in darkness. Eventually, Kratos makes his way to the Temple of Helios, the source of the remaining light, and the Sun Chariot. He encounters a statue of Athena, who tells him that Helios has disappeared and Morpheus has used this to his advantage to cause the gods to fall into a deep slumber. Athena wants Kratos to retrieve Helios so he can release Morpheus' grasp on the other gods and his power over the Earth. Along the way, Kratos is haunted by a strange melody, which he later recognizes as a song played by his daughter, Calliope. Making his way through the Temple of Helios, Kratos encounters Helios' sister, Eos, who promptly sends him to the caves within the Temple of Olympus. She guarantees Kratos the gods will relieve him of his nightmares if he agrees to save Helios from the Titan Atlas, who abducted him. Casting her promise aside, as the gods betrayed him before, Kratos nevertheless agrees, albeit reluctantly, to save Helios. Kratos then retrieves the Primordial Fire needed to awaken the Fire Steeds from the cave and returns to the temple. After restoring the fire steeds back to life, the horses lead Kratos into the Underworld before retreating. There, he meets Charon, on his ferry, upon the River Styx. The ferryman soon lists the similarities between himself and Kratos, saying they are both slaves to the Olympians. Charon then tells Kratos to go, saying it is not yet his time. Having denied Kratos passage, and Kratos refusing to leave, they engage in a fight, before Charon knocks Kratos unconscious and drops him into Tartarus. There, Kratos witnesses the breaking of the chains binding Atlas to the pits of Tartarus. After some time, the Spartan fights and climbs his way out of Tartarus, returning to defeat Charon. Seizing control of the ferry, he follows the light of Helios, currently illuminating the underworld, down the river Styx, coming upon the Temple of Persephone. To his own surprise, he sees his daughter Calliope on the shorelines of the temple and follows her inside. Unable to locate her, instead he meets Persephone, Queen of the Underworld. Persephone tells Kratos that Calliope is in the Elysium Fields and that the only way to see her again is for Kratos to \"release\" all of his past evils and become worthy of Elysium, giving up his powers given to him by the gods; however, Persephone warns him that the world will suffer for his choice. After transferring his power into the Forsaken Tree, which included all of his weapons, his magic, and relics, Kratos regains his humanity, becoming a normal man and being reunited with his daughter. However, Persephone appears: she taunts and mocks Kratos' choice and reveals to him her true plans. Bitter at being betrayed by Zeus, tricked by Hades and abandoned by the gods, Persephone was the one who had freed Atlas. While Kratos was disarming himself, Atlas was slowly carrying out Persephone's plan to destroy the pillar that holds the world, and with it, Olympus. Persephone plans to kill everyone, including herself, to free her from her situation. Kratos realizes now that if he stays with his daughter, it would mean the end of the world for everyone, including Calliope and himself. Though it tears him apart, he sacrifices seeing his daughter again in order to regain his power by killing all the souls in Elysium. From some of the souls, he gets back his weapons, relics, and magic. Because of this, he once more becomes the Ghost of Sparta, regaining his characteristic appearance. After which, Calliope breaks down crying at the sight of a reborn Kratos, who presses on. With his skills restored, Kratos pursues Persephone, catching her at the base of the pillar. She tells him it is the end, then reveals her other form - a winged woman wearing black armor - before carrying Kratos to the top of the pillar. Once they reach the summit, Kratos and Persephone engage in a bloody final battle; during the battle, Persephone tries to subdue and confuse Kratos, urging him to go back to Elysium and be with Calliope, and when he resists, she orders Atlas to destroy him. Kratos chains Atlas to the roof of the underworld before returning to battle Persephone and eventually killing her with the Gauntlet of Zeus. Dying, but uncaring of her fate, the goddess taunts Kratos, snarling that now his suffering shall never end as her body then explodes, severing the pillar in the shockwave with Atlas now the only thing holding the world together. Though the Titan to gloats to him about the gods' true plans for him, Kratos believes his path is clear, serving them regardless so they will keep their promises to free him from his nightmares as it is all he has left. Atlas ends by foretelling that they will meet again. Keeping his own promise to the gods, Kratos returns Helios to the sky. But he is left with the knowledge that his sins have consumed him, and he will never be pure enough to see his daughter again. Weak from battle, Kratos falls unconscious from the sun chariot but is suddenly stopped before striking the ground, being placed on the cliffs that he would later jump from in the original God of War. Two gods, Athena and Helios approach him and, as they praise him for his work, remove the Sun Shield and the Gauntlet of Zeus. As they depart through the gate to Olympus, Helios suggests on helping the warrior further, only for Athena to refuse by saying \"He'll live. They must.\" The pair then retreats through the gateway to Olympus, leaving an unconscious Kratos at the cliffs overlooking the Aegean Sea.Characters Enemies Bosses Items and abilities Weapons Magic Relics Bonus Costumes Cut Content April Fool '09 Gag Cast Trivia Videos Trailers  God of War Origins Collection for PS3Hermes  Hermes is the Olympian God of Travelers, Messengers, Thieves, Commerce, Sports, Athletics, and Speed. He is the son of the King of Olympus Zeus and the Pleiades Maia. He is also the father of Ceryx, the messenger of Mt. Olympus.Greek Mythology  In Greek mythology, Hermes is the messenger of the gods and additionally, a guide to the Underworld. As an Olympian god, his sphere of influence was vast; he was the patron of boundaries (and the travelers who cross them), shepherds and cowherds, thieves and liars (and their cunning), orators and wit, literature and poets, athletics and sports, weights and measures, invention, general commerce, profit and good luck. He also acted as the messenger of Hades, guiding departed souls to their final resting place and carrying messages between the Underworld and Olympus. Another of his duties was to take Dreams from the God Morpheus and deliver them to the mortals. His symbols include the tortoise, the rooster, the winged hat, the caduceus and his winged sandals. He was the son of Zeus and the Pleiades Maia, a daughter of the mighty Titan Atlas. His Roman counterpart was Mercury. Hermes was born sometime after the first Titan War to Zeus and a goddess named Maia. He matured rapidly and within a few minutes of his birth stole the cattle of Apollo and invented the lyre. He even thought of a clever way to cover up his crime: tying bundles of grass to the cows' feet and leading them backward out of the pasture to make it look like something had been led into the pasture, but not away from it. Despite this, Apollo found out and went to Zeus for justice. When brought before his father, Hermes attempted to charm Zeus into letting him go by telling him he was just an innocent new born baby. Undeceived, but amused by the child's boldness, Zeus instead forced him to compensate Apollo, which Hermes did by presenting him with the lyreIn the God of War Series First Titanomachy  During the Great War, Hermes is one of the gods who fought the Titans and is seen dodging a boulder thrown at him by one of them. He bore witness to his father Zeus using Blade of Olympus to banish the Titans to Tartarus for all eternity.Wager of the Gods  Hermes, much like his brethren, was briefly seen competing in the wager of the gods, a contest in which each god chose one mortal to represent themselves in a search for Ambrosia. He was later seen with Poseidon, watching as Kratos, Ares' champion, slaughtered many enemies in his path. His confidence in his own champion, Danaus, proved infallible, as he continually taunted his fellow gods about his champion being the one to steal the Ambrosia. Unfortunately for Hermes, Danaus later met his end at the hands of Hades' champion, Alrik.Ceryx' Death  Hermes' son Ceryx faced Kratos in battle, and was killed. Hermes himself seemingly did not appear, although one theory about the identity of assassin who killed Argos, claims that he was Hermes himself in disguise, since the Greek myths detailed it was he who slew Argos in the name of Zeus. If this theory is correct, it means nearly all the gods of Olympus plotted against Kratos.Second Titanomachy  Hermes was one of the Gods who battled Kratos and the Titans when they were ascending Mount Olympus. Hermes had leapt down from the balcony and ran straight down the mountain itself. He was not seen since. During his first encounter with the Labyrinth, Kratos eventually ran into Hermes directly (who just happened to be standing on a part of the Labyrinth at the time; possibly waiting for Kratos), who taunted him about his quest for vengeance and boasted his own speed. After briefly trading insults with Kratos, Hermes ran up the Chain of Balance linking the Underworld and Olympus, with Kratos in pursuit.Death  Reappearing in the Chamber of the Flame, Hermes again taunted Kratos about his lack of speed. He then led Kratos around the outside of the Olympian Citadel on a perilous chase, with Kratos dodging incoming projectiles. Eventually, Kratos managed to finally corner Hermes by launching a boulder from a catapult; chaining himself to the boulder with his blades. The boulder smashed into an Athena statue, which Hermes had previously perched himself on, and caused the statue to come crumbling down on a nearby building with the two clinging to it. Unfortunately for Hermes though, the wounds that he had suffered from the crash had left him critically injured and exhausted. Now unable to escape his enemy, Hermes ultimately decided and attempted to defeat Kratos in combat, using his formidable speed and agility to his advantage however, he would be forced to continually stop fighting to catch his breath. Upon his defeat, Hermes mocked Kratos one final time, stating in the end he would betray only himself. Kratos then overpowered him and severed his half-brother's legs in order to claim his winged boots. With his ultimate death, Hermes' corpse dissolved into a swarm of disease-carrying flies that flew across Olympus; covering the land with pestilence and causing the deaths of several of Olympus' servants in the process.Personality  Hermes is shown as being playful and childish. He is greatly arrogant and boastful of his own speed, thinking that Kratos has no chance of defeating him. He acts quite laid-back most of the time, frequently flipping his coin when idle. He is also fairly talkative, taunting Kratos about his tendency to kill family members, his quest for vengeance, and his inability to match Hermes' speed. However, it appears that this light-hearted demeanor masks an intense hatred, which occasionally becomes evident in his dialogue with the Spartan and especially manifests itself when he is forced to confront Kratos in battle. It is possible this is due to the fact that Kratos has killed his son Ceryx. Like most of the gods defeated in the game, he remains defiant to the end, laughing at Kratos' \"own sense of honor\" and insisting that the Ghost of Sparta will only betray himself in the end.Powers & Abilities  As one of the Olympians and the messenger of the Gods, Hermes was both immortal and highly resistant to most forms of physical damage. Although he himself was not nearly as powerful as many of the other gods, Hermes was still very powerful in his own right. He possessed most of the standard abilities of a god, such as enhanced physical abilities as well as increased endurance; allowing him to remain physically active for incredible periods of time. However, his most famous attribute was his immense physical agility and speed. By wearing his winged boots, Hermes' already impressive agility and speed are magnified to beyond superhuman levels and allow him to become virtually untouchable in combat. While wearing the boots, Hermes displayed his enhanced agility by performing amazing feats such as: Hermes may also have had the power of conjuring the elements, as seen at the end of God of War II, Hermes had fire protruding from his hair and winged sandals. However, in God of War III, Hermes has bright light for hair that is sometimes seen with flames emanating from it. But for all of his unique powers and abilities, Hermes was not truly invincible. In fact, for all of his boasting, he is actually one of the few gods that Kratos defeats rather easily and without much effort. Hermes mainly relied on his speed and agility in combat, knowing full well that he could never hope to win against Kratos in a straight fight. Likewise, Kratos appears to view Hermes as more of a pest than a serious threat, only engaging in battle with him after incessant taunting and provocation. Overall, Hermes, despite his limitations, still proved to be an impressive and skillful individual. Combining his agility with his physical abilities, he was able to utilize the environment around him as a means to gain the upperhand over his opponents; making him show signs of an impressive intelligence; showing that he is one of the more clever and creative of the gods (while most of the gods, despite being very creative in their own ways, were mostly blinded by the evils that were infecting them as well as their arrogance).Trivia Related Pages ", "Sonic Fanon Forums Wiki": "Sonic Fanon Forums Wiki ", "UMS Wiki": "UMS Wiki ", "Animal Jam Forums Wiki": "Animal Jam Forums Wiki ", "Wario Forums Wiki": "Wario Forums Wiki ", "Roblox Developer and Player Rorums Wiki": "Roblox Developer and Player Rorums Wiki ", "Nerf Forums Wiki": "Nerf Forums Wiki ", "JumpTech Wiki": "JumpTech Wiki JumpTech Wiki   JumpTech is an episodic live-action role-playing game (LARP) running at gaming conventions in Ireland since January 2009. Because as much game background comes from the players as comes from the writing team, this wiki allows everyone to collaboratively put all of their information in one place. If you've never played JumpTech before, you might like to read our background. Alternatively you might like to see when the next event is using the JumpTech Episode List! If you're already a JumpTech player you'll probably be using this wiki as a reference guide. You could start by looking at information about the Families, one of the Four Races, or look at a list of Objects in Space! If you would like to contribute to the wiki, please see the Guidelines section before you do anything else.Guidelines == Re: Proposed Categories:  Looking at the proposed Categories list it's quite physical. Was going to suggest some knowledge based Categories: Medicine, Technology, Politics, So the Jump Cancer page might have the categories (Medicine, Technology, The Web) PytrLomo 12:38, March 19, 2010 (UTC)Proposed Categories:  Star Systems: - Hamak System, Tarn System, Teth System, Kyrace System, The Four Systems -- and anything else that comes up as related to specific star systems. (Agreed, though Hamak is spelled without a \"c\" Kshandr 10:29, February 8, 2010 (UTC)) Races:- Human, Tarn, Teth, The Krayce, The Four Races -- and anything else that relates to particular races as yet undiscovered. (Agreed Kshandr 10:29, February 8, 2010 (UTC)) Families:- The Dragons, The Furies, The Silverbolts, The Scimitars, The Cabal, The Sunhawks, The Scorpions, The Racers, The Orchids -- Nick, there is too many Families here...I thought there was only 8 (inc. The Scorpians) (You're right in that there's more than seven, but wrong that there's \"too many.\" I've listed the Scorpions (previous owners of the Sting), the Orchids (previous owners of the Majestic) and the Racers (previous owners of the Valkyrie.) I think it's important to keep the level of history and my intent is that anything I've mentioned in a character background that isn't top sekrit makes it into the wiki. Kshandr 08:57, February 8, 2010 (UTC)) Jumpships:- The Firebreed, The Salamanca, The Valkyrie, The Hobgoblin, The Majestic, The Kestrel, The Silverbolt, The Sting, Objects in Space - Here there is only 8...see above?!? (eight Jump Drives (well, seven now), more than that families. Kshandr 08:57, February 8, 2010 (UTC)) Space Stations - Objects in Space, Serenity, The Web, Vikkil II (Agreed, though there's more space stations to come Kshandr 10:29, February 8, 2010 (UTC)) Teth\u00a0:- Teth System, Teth (Race), The Web, The Sting, Vikkil II, Veris, Vallas, Vunith -- Plus any other objects or organisations based in or connected to the Teth (Add Vikkil - the fourth tribe we've got on the books. I'll likely add an article for them today. Kshandr 08:57, February 8, 2010 (UTC)) Human:- Human (Race), Hamak System, Hamak X, Serenity, Families, Jumpships, each Family Page, each Jumpship Page -- Plus any other objects or organisations based in or connected to the Humans (Agreed Kshandr 10:29, February 8, 2010 (UTC)) Tarn\u00a0:- Tarn (Race), Tarn System -- Plus any other objects or organisations based in or connected to the Tarn (Agreed Kshandr 10:29, February 8, 2010 (UTC)) Krace:- The Krayce, Krayce System -- Plus any other objects or organisations based in or connected to the Krayce (Agreed Kshandr 10:29, February 8, 2010 (UTC)) Organisations:- The Four System Bank, The Steam Industries Corporation, The Trade Commission. (Agreed, and we should add Sentinel corporation and Tourou corporation at least Kshandr 10:29, February 8, 2010 (UTC)) On Families & Jumpships - OK, I should have matched Ships to Families to discover that the certain Ships have been owned by more than one Family. On Star Systems - yeah I knoww...known typo I'm watching for. On Space Stations, Teth, & Organisations - Consider them added. i don't ex[pect the above list to be exhausted, it's just what I have for the moment. Kephron 14:03, February 8, 2010 (UTC)Also proposed:  Character pages linked to the relevant Categories e.g. Foss would be linked to Human (race), Human, Hamak System, and possibly to Space Stations as well. Ella would be linked to Human (race), Human, Hamak System, The Families, and possibly to JumpShips. Character pages to be written by player or contain the very basics i.e Foss Grav is a Human and, along with Lync Hosh, is the co-owner of The Web space station. (I want to think about this one - on the one hand I agree that we should get folk to write their character's \"bio.\" On the other hand, that's going to result in a number of \"holes\" because not all of our players will want to be involved. Kshandr 08:57, February 8, 2010 (UTC)) On Character pages - The idea was that players write them or we, after a suitable period, do. Or, rather you do, as I have no idea about a lot of the characters when I am outside the game. Trying to reduce teh work load on you\u00a0;-) Kephron 14:06, February 8, 2010 (UTC)Races:  I have done the Human page using the info from the player brief...is this OK. It doesn't seem to contain anything non-human players really don't need to know. (I've commented on that one on its own talk page (to avoid overloading this one.) Broadly, I'm not sure I'm comfy with it... Kshandr 10:33, February 8, 2010 (UTC)) Lastly, can we set up some kind of tracking page so we know what is being worked on and what is done? Kephron 23:27, February 7, 2010 (UTC)Objects in Space  \"Objects in Space\" refers to any man-made object that can be found in space. In practice, this refers to spaceships, jumpships and space stations. Other objects in space are possible and will be listed here as special cases.Spaceships  Any vehicle that moves in space is classed as a spaceship, from launchers that get payloads into space to the simple mining vessels that are a mainstay in each of the Four Systems. Spaceships are not capable of Jump travel, and at present JumpShips are not capable of carrying something as large as a spaceship. Therefore, this list is broken down by Star System: Hamak system Teth system Krayce system Tarn systemJumpShips  A JumpShip is a spaceship that has had a Jump Drive retrofitted onto it. There can only be as many JumpShips as there are Jump Drives, and, although there were eight originally, there are now only seven Jump Drives. JumpShips are the only way of getting from one Star System to another and are jealously guarded by the Families.Space Stations  Hamak System Teth System Krayce System Tarn SystemOther Jump Cancer  Jump Cancer is a disease that affects travellers aboard Jumpships. It only affects travllers taking repeated jumps over a long period of time. Contrary to its name, it is not in fact a cancer, but a mutation of cells and bacteria within the patients body.Discovery  Jump Cancer was discovered during the events of Episode 2 - Cancer.Cause  Jump Cancer seems to be caused by some form of radiation. The subject is exposed to this radiation when they undergo a Jump using a Jumpdrive. Long-term exposure to the radiation causes mutations in the bodies own bacteria. Normally benign bacterial strains then start attacking the body. Common symptoms include lesions on the skin and severe digestive upset as the bacteria in the alimentary canal mutate and attack. Efforts have been made to determine what constitutes a safe level of exposure to radiation from Jump drives. These efforts have been hindered by the fact that the amount of radiation emitted from one jump to another seems to fluctuate, with no definable pattern.Prognosis  Currently, Jump Cancer is terminal. The patients body will eventually succumb to the attacking bacteria. There is some concern that the mutated bacteria could spread to other hosts, but there has been no conclusive evidence of this. Current treatment is to destroy as much of the mutated bacteria as possible, replacing it with genetically modified bacteria in an effort to manage the progression of the disease, while administering drugs to manage the symptoms.The search for a cure  Dr. Pytr Lomo's Research team aboard the Web Space Station are currently researching Jump Cancer with a view to finding a cure. Dr. Lomo's results are published openly, while they are pursuing several avenues of inquiry, no obvious cure has emerged. Currently most treatment is palliative.The Valkyrie Ownership  The Valkyrie is owned by the Furies Family.Class  The Valkyrie is a JumpShip of standard class.Actions  During \"Cancer\" the Valkyrie jumped into Tarn space to recover the wreck of the Majestic. During \"War\" the Valkyrie helped to defend Hoboville against attack and was partly responsible for the destruction of the Sting. During \"Discovery\" and \"Union\" the Valkyrie made a number of exploratory jumps to the Krayce system.Crew JumpTech Episode List  Episode 1 - Newcomers (Warpcon XIX Jan 2009) Episode 2 - Cancer (Leprecon XXX February 2009) Episode 3 - War (Itzacon V March 2009) Episode 4 - Discovery (Gaelcon XX October 2009) Episode 5 - Union (Warpcon XX January 2010) Episode 6 - Damocles (Leprecon XXXI March 2010)Guidelines  JumpTech is an evolving game, and is overseen by a GM - all of the content in the game was originally created by this GM, and is covered Creative Commons Share-Alike with Attribution.

Ostensibly, the meeting was designed to act as a venue for the signing of a peace treaty between the Humans and the Teth, officially ending the Teth/Human war. Traders and diplomats were invited to the meeting, and it was also attended by a number of the residents of Hoboville itself. Attending the meeting were representatives from the Hamak, Krayce and Teth system governments. There were three JumpShips present \u2013 the Firebreed, the Valkyrie and the Majestic, carrying envoys from the Furies and the Dragons Families. For the first time, all three of the major Hamak corporations were present \u2013 Tourou, Steam Industries and Sentinel. There was a certain amount of discussion at the meeting regarding recent events in the Krayce system and the actions of the Cabal in taking it for their own. These were interrupted when a pair of activists burst into the conference room waving guns and took one Teth hostage. The activists were both gunned down, and interrogated about their intentions and why they took the action they took. They explained that they were part of an anti-Teth movement, growing on Hoboville since the strike the Teth-controlled JumpShip Sting made on Hoboville (in \"War.\") The Valkyrie, crewed by a conglomerate of diplomats and the Furies travelled to the Krayce system in an attempt to parlay some kind of peace with the Cabal. They were threatened and left promptly, but not before observing that a space station is being built in the Krayce system - assumedly by the Cabal. As the meeting drew to a close, three JumpShips of an unknown configuration jumped into Hamak space not far from Hoboville itself. They remained stationary and in formation for a number of minutes, prompting panic among some of the meeting's delegates. Although they were hailed they did not respond, and promptly jumped out of Hamak space.The Drifter Origins  Though the story of the discovery of the Drifter is taught in every school in the Four Systems, it's true to say that nobody really knows exactly what happened. The story goes that the crew of the salvage ship Marianne found the drifting hulk of a spaceship of unknown configuration. Within it were the Jump Engines - large pieces of machinery which now form the hearts of the JumpShips we know today. The drives were removed from the the Drifter, and an agreement reached among the crew of the Marianne that each member of the crew would get one when the drives were discovered to be easily wedded to Human technology. Ships were bought or stolen, and the first JumpShips were born. The remains of the Drifter were blown up so that the secret of the Jump Engines remained with the original JumpShip captains. Of course, none of those captains are still alive. Every child knows that each JumpShip has changed hands a dozen times since then. But many questions remain. How could a salvage crew have reverse-engineered the Drifter's technology? How long did the crew of the Marianne know about the Drifter before they plundered its bounty? Who did the actual work of attaching a Jump Engine to a spaceship? Nobody knows. Or nobody is telling.Analysis  Later analysis of Drifter fragments that were discovered by the many \"foreign technology prospectors\" that came later on suggested that the Drifter was constructed of alloys unknown in the Four Systems. Later discoveries of Drifter-technology led to the discovery of Veriseum. Nobody has yet managed to duplicate the technology of the Jump Engines, there is still debate between the physics and astrogation communities over exactly how Jump Engines work. Analysis of the input and output ports on a Jump Engine would suggest that Drifter technology is very similar to Human technology, as evidenced by the fact that Jump Engines can be installed easily in Human spacecraft.Tarn System  The Tarn system is the smallest of the Four Systems, both in terms of number of planets and the mass of the planets that there are. It is the home to the Tarn race.Planetary Structure Other Notable Features  While some stellar cartographers might suggest at first glance that Tarn III was a satellite of Tarn II, the two are of planetary size, and have a complex orbital path. Observation of these bodies led to an early understanding of gravitation and orbital mechanics for the Tarn race.The Four Races  Write the first paragraph of your article here.Humans  The other races see the Humans as the hardest working race. They are the only ones to have colonised another star system, and there is a mystique around them for that reason. However, there\u2019s also a distrust for Humans; after all they did discover the Jump Drives and kept the discovery to themselves. Humans are generally \u2013 Of any one of a dozen religions \u2013 including atheism, generous, cautious with strangers, as likely to solve a problem by diplomacy as with violence.Teth  The other races see the Teth as grumpy, xenophobic and elitist. The Teth would take all of those criticisms as complements. Teth science, however, is advanced in many areas. Were it not for the JumpShips, the Teth would be the most technologically advanced race. Teth are generally \u2013 Completely different among their friends than among those they don\u2019t know. They could follow one of a hundred gods favoured by their tribes. They solve problems typically by considering a number of strategies and employing what they consider to be the most efficient, making them appear cautious.Krayce  The Krayce are seen as busybodies and like jumpy wood animals. The Teth in particular can be brutal and unpleasant about the Krayce and their flighty nature. However, all the other races listen to what the Krayce have to say. Their track record cannot be faulted. Krayce are generally - likely to solve their problems with words and not with a show of strength. Slightly ill-at-ease around strangers. Uncomfortable with being in the same place for too long. The Krayce do not have any concept of religion, being comfortable with their own mortality. However \u2013 many Krayce believe in the concept of \u201cHome\u201d, which they loosely define as the perfect place; the place where one would put down roots and stay.The Silverbolt Ownership  The SIlverbolt is owned by the Silverfish Family.Class  The Silverbolt is a JumpShip of standard class.Actions  None of note.Crew Episode 4 - Discovery Blurb  The four systems of Krayce, Hamak, Teth and Tarn have weathered a difficult eighteen months. Diplomats murdered and ejected from jumpships; parts of an orbital colony destroyed offhandedly by an alien power; war declared between star systems too far apart to reasonably attack each other. In each case, the ten jumpship families have been involved in some way. But now a new discovery could change everything in the four systems. A signal from an unknown race has been received. And they have the technology to build brand new jump drives.Recap  A meeting took place in the Teth system on board the Vikkil II - a space station belonging to the ruling Teth tribe, four months after the events of \"War.\" In the intervening time, a duo of terrible cataclysms have left the Krayce homeworld in dire straits and a significant proportion of its inhabitants dead. Attending were representatives from the Teth tribes Veris, Vallas and Vunith, and more Krayce than have been seen in one place at one time at previous meetings of this kind. Some of these number were diplomats, and some traders. Two thirds of those at the meeting were humans, including representatives from the Furies and the Web as well as diplomats and representatives from Hamak megacorporations - the Steam Industries Corporation and Sentinel Corporation. A number of independent traders were also present. For the first time, a member of the mysterious Tarn had journeyed to make contact with members of another race. Although there was no clear single topic of discussion, there was a lot of communication between various groups. So much so, in fact, that when the JumpShip The Hobgoblin - owned by the Cabal Family - jumped into local space, not a lot of notice was taken of it. Not a lot of notice was taken of a message that was subsequently sent to the space station, to the effect that the Cabal had taken the Krayce system for their own and that outsiders were not welcome. The Valkyrie was dispatched to investigate but returned very quickly. At the end of the meeting a Cabal agent aboard the Vikkil II was revealed and taken into Teth custody. In the absence of any other transportation, all those wishing to travel on to other systems did so aboard The Valkyrie.JumpTech Categories  Suggestion - Could we have a category for OOC game information?

The jumpships are owned by families \u2013 groups of mercenaries and pilots who are the ultimate traders, commanding astronomical fees for a service only they can provide. But how responsible are the Families for the cargo they carry? When it becomes clear that one star system is amassing arms and people for a war against another, will the Families push the conflict forward or try and get into interstellar politics?Recap  The meeting took place in the Hamak System system on Serenity - a space station belonging to the Human government, one month after the Teth declaration of war. Attending were The Furies, The Scimitars, representatives from the Teth government, a representative from the Human government, a representative from the Krayce government, corporate representatives from the Four Systems Bank and the Steam Industries Corporation as well as an independant trader and a representative from the Trade Commission. Mostly led by the Human diplomat, a strong effort was made at a peaceful resolution between the parties present. This was interrupted when the The Sting (a JumpShip bought by the Teth some month before) jumped into Hamak space in between Serenity and Hoboville - the shantytown built around the hull of the Human colony ship in the asteroid cloud on the outskirts of Hamak IV. Hoboville spaceships were launched and attacked The Sting, which responded. The Valkyrie (under the command of the Furies) and The Salamanca (under the command of the Scimitars) departed Serenity to lend support to the Hoboville forces. Although Human diplomats attempted to stop the conflict, Hoboville claimed that the space surrounding it was sovereign territory and not under the jurisdiction of the Hamak system government. Under heavy fire, The Sting jumped behind the Hoboville forces and launched a bomb at Hoboville itself, causing severe damage (and significant loss of life) to the shantytown, before jumping away. The Furies and Scimitars followed The Sting to Teth space, where it was disabled, and then destroyed (along with its Jump Engine) to prevent it from falling back into Teth hands. However - this wasn't the only loss of Teth life. One of the Teth diplomats part aboard Serenity was shot dead by the other. At the end of the game, The Furies and Scimitars had left for Krayce space, leaving the Human and Teth diplomats in Teth space to broker peace on Tethis - the Teth homeworld. The Four Systems Bank, the Steam Industries Corporation and the Trade Commission representatives were still aboard Serenity while the independent trader had returned to Hoboville.Human (Race)  I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with this. Effectively, putting this information on the wiki negates the need for the \"Knowledge: Human\" skill. If the other races follow suit then we would lose all of the mystery surrounding the Tarn, for example. While I appreciate that Humans are the most numerous of the Four Races, plot lines like \"we don't know where Earth went\" are better communicated in play than over the wiki. I'd prefer if we went with the common information from the \"the Races\" page, and then added new information like what Humans tend to look like, biology etc. Kshandr 09:42, February 8, 2010 (UTC) You are. of course, right in this.

Flames of war allows players to wargame company level battles from the European theater using 15mm (which the game claims is approximately 1/100 scale but is closer to 1/120) miniatures. There have been basic lists provided to cover the early and late war periods as well but the focus so far has been on Mid-War, though in the second half of 2006 they will begin releasing Late War sourcebooks, and corresponding tanks and weapons. An Early War book is due for publication shortly. The 2nd Edition was released in 2006. In New Zealand, in 2006 Mid war is the most common era played with specialist annual Early and Late war conventions being offered by the Hamilton Immortals (EW November) and Taranaki Old Guard Clubs (LW March).Gameplay  Gameplay takes place over a series of turns, with players alternating movement, shooting and close assault, using the \"I go-You go\" system of play style, which helps people who are familiar with other games such as Warhammer Fantasy Battles or Warhammer 40,000 to quickly pick up the idea of gameplay. The game is optimised for 2 players, although it is generally feasible for up to 14 players to be playing at the same time. Play revolves around company level tactics, with stands representing half-squads(sections) of infantry and support troops, and single models representing tanks, jeeps, motorcycles and armoured cars. Air support in the form of fighters (like the Hawker Hurricane)and light bombers (no heavy bombers - like the Avro Lancaster or the B-17 Flying Fortress) is also available to players wishing to use it, with aircraft generally being represented by 15mm scale models. The main rulebook has numerous scenarios players can try, from a simple all out battle scenarios to objective taking missions. The army sourcebooks contain further scenarios, usually centered around events relevant to that particular book. Gameplay uses six sided dice and measurements are provided in both inches and centimeters which has increased the game's global appeal. Currently the armies playable are; German Wehrmacht, Fallschirmjager(airborne), Deutsche Afrika Corps., and SS units, U.S. Army (including Rangers and Airborne units), British and the Commonwealth troops (India, Australia, Canada, South Africa, and New Zealand), the U.S.S.R., Italian Bersaglieri (elites) and Fucilieri(conscripted troops), and most recently Hungarians, Finns, and Romanians (German Allies). The rules are being updated in the autumn of 2006 to the second version. Sometime later the pacific theater will be released but that is after early war Europe is released. It is (currently) a WWII-only game with rules relatively lower in complexity as Games Workshop's Warhammer 40,000, though it is supposedly more realistic Flames of War has been very successful, especially with fantasy or sci-fi gamers who are interested in World War II wargaming but lack the in depth knowledge of the troops that most historical wargames assume the players have. Flames of War has a \"one stop shop\" appeal because the rulebook and sourcebooks assume that the player has little knowledge of the various troops and provide not only background material on some actual forces and battles but also provide simple graphical representations of the contents of each platoon and brief descriptions of the forces.Rules and Sourcebooks  Currently Battlefront has released books regarding the mid-war period (circa 1942-1943). The first edition of the main rulebook included basic force lists for the Germans, US, Soviets, British and Italians. Since then they have released additional sourcebooks that have replaced those lists and added additional force lists. These sourcebooks are: Flames of War divides WWII into 3 periods. Early war (1939-41), mid war (1942-43) and late war (1944-45). It is believed that when Battlefront releases rules and models for the Pacific theater, it will separate it from the European theater for game play reasons. Battlefront has begun to release 'late war' rules and models and their first late war release sourcebook is called \"D Minus 1\" that provides army lists for the allied paratroop regiments active in the late war European theater during January 1944-August 1944. Later sourcebooks will then be released detailing the various forces from May 1944 and forward. In November of 2006 Battlefront is planning to release the a sourcebook which will cover the Normandy Campaign and in January of 2007 the first divisional sourcebook will be released.Older / Non-current books  These books have been replaced with Afrika and Ostfront which reflect the current (Version 2) rulesUnofficial Lists  Some players have come up with \"homebrew\" army lists to cover other factions or wars including Japanese and US WWII Pacific Theater. As of yet Battlefront hasn't released official lists for the Pacific Theater and has only recently begun to move into 'late war' (1944-45). They have made an announcement that they will be working on another historical period, but haven't yet announced what it is.Successor Games  Recently, there has been a lot of fan speculation surrounding Battlefronts intentions to do a new game based on the Napoleonic wars era of the early 19th Century using the WWII FoW as a base, however as yet Battlefront have made no official announcement as to what their successor game will be. Many players and fans have also come up with \"homebrew\" rulesets for Napoleonic and modern era wargaming, using FoW as a base.Models And Availability  Models for use in game are manufactured by Battlefront themselves and consist of highly detailed multipart metal and resin models. Models can be bought in blister packs, small box sets, large box sets and army deal box sets. Other manufacturers 15mm figures can be used to play FoW if a player with an existing 15mm army wants to get into the game. Battlefront have also publicly stated on several occasions that other manufacturers models are fine to be used in tournaments where FoW is being played. All Battlefront asks is that other manufacturers models are not displayed or talked about on the official Flames of War discussion forums (http://fow.flamesofwar.com). It is general consensus among most FoW players that Battlefronts figures are the best quality sculptures available in 15mm with the greatest levels of detail. Battlefront produces models for ground forces, such as infantry, vehicles and field guns, and in mid 2006 released sets of 1/144 aircraft. (Hurricane II, JU-87 'Stuka', Il-2 'Shturmovik' and P-40 'Warhawk') Flames of War miniatures are available direct from Battlefront, but can also be picked up in many good hobby and wargames shops, as well as some toy retailers, though most 15mm World War II miniatures can work so long as they are based the same as the official minis. Unlike many historical wargames the miniatures for Flames of war are packaged in such a way as to simplify building a force. Each pack will include the bases for the figures inside the package as well as most of the options you can field the force with. Many of the blisters or boxed sets actually include everything you need to field a full platoon of that type, though some will require the purchase of additional blisters in order to field a full platoon. This has added to the game's appeal of being easy to get into. Gale Force 9 has also been releasing licensed products for the game including an artillery template, army specific counters/markers and most recently announced magnetic base kits. t depicted on the board but rather is assumed to be firing bombardments from a considerable distance from the battlefield. Also the fact that game initiative is a IGOUGO turn-based system and lacks opportunity fire are common complaints from those who play more traditional miniatures wargames which try to more accurately simulate warfare instead of focusing on the gaming aspect. Also the forces are \"points based\" to allow for easy pickup play and tournament play, whereas most historical miniatures wargames tend to be accurate depictions of actual battles with forces representative of those that were actually at the battle and were not always \"balanced\". Other historical wargamers have embraced Flames of War for its appeal to gamers who previously hadn't played historical games and its ability to be a \"one stop shop\" to introduce people not only to World War II historical gaming but also to miniatures wargaming in general. Though the mechanics differ greatly from most historical wargames many feel that the end results are quite similar and realistic. They view Flames of War as a great \"entry\" game to historical wargaming and hope that it will increase interest in other more traditional systems and periods of historical wargaming. Some gamers accuse Battlefront of using Games Workshop type marketing tactics with their sleek full color presentation and release of various sourcebooks as opposed to many traditional historical wargames which usually have a \"no frills\" presentation value (often being xeroxed pages stapled together) but are much more affordably priced and do not add sourcebooks to gameplay. Some have accused Battlefront of requiring players to buy sourcebooks for armies they do not own to get rules which are included in those sourcebooks, but to date Battlefront has made all those rules available for free download from their webpage so a player is not required to own any other sourcebook than the one that contains the army list he/she wishes to play.Pros & Cons  Pros: The game is easily understood and simple to teach. The game has very nice books that explain units, armies, modelling, painting and about everything you need to know to play and model / paint your army. Quick Gameplay - average games are about 1.5 to 2.5 hours long. The Cost of building an army is very reasonable compared to most wargames on the market. (A typical 1500 pts army comes in at around $200, - which is quite cheap compared to other Wargames, like Warhammer 40K which generally costs $350-$400) Good company support, with the game designers answering questions in person through battlefronts forums or by email. Rules updates and beta version army lists available as free downloads. Points based forces make it easy to balance each player's army, plus players forces are interchangeable and flexible, as opposed to traditional historical wargames which require players to conduct extensive research and purchase a new army each time they intend to start a campaign. Cons: The game rules are simplified, so the amount of complexity present in traditional historicals is lost, which puts many historical players off. A substantial argument in this area has been the 'telescoping' ground scale. Being that Battlefront are a fairly new company, they have very little exposure in the marketplace. No opportunity or \"snap\" fire, a feature pioneered in Squad Leader and duplicated in a lot of games but deliberately left out by FoW's designers. Games are not always \"historically accurate\" and in a tournament you will often find forces which were historically allies fighting each other. However, as with many games this is a problem created by what armies people choose to collect and not so much the game itself. Some Gamers are annoyed with the fact that it is as easy to \"kill\" a 2-man stand as it is to \"kill\" a 5-man stand. The designers answer to this has been that killing 2 men will destroy a 2 man team, while killing 2 men in a 5 man team the other 3 men will care for the wounded, removing them from combat as well.External links  Go to the official Flames of war website to see more: Fan sitesGames Workshop  Template:Dablink Template:Infobox Company Games Workshop Group PLC (often abbreviated to GW) is a British game production and retailing company. Games Workshop is one of the largest games companies in the world, and is the dominant company in the miniature wargaming hobby. The company is listed on the London Stock Exchange with the symbol GAW.Overview  Founded in 1975 by Ian Livingstone and Steve Jackson (also known for their Fighting Fantasy gamebooks), Games Workshop was originally an importer of the U.S. roleplaying game Dungeons & Dragons. Under the direction of Livingstone and Jackson, Games Workshop expanded from being a bedroom mail-order company to a successful gaming publisher and manufacturer. In June 1977, partially to advertise the opening of the first Games Workshop store, Livingstone and Jackson launched the gaming magazine White Dwarf, which Livingstone also edited. Their publishing arm also created UK reprints of famous, but then expensive to import, American RPGs such as Call of Cthulhu, Runequest, Traveller and Middle-Earth Role-Play. In 1979, Games Workshop provided the funding to help found Citadel Miniatures, in Newark, a company that would produce the metal minatures that were used in role-playing and table-top wargames. The Citadel name has become synonymous with Games Workshop Miniatures and continues to be a trademarked brand name used in association with them long after the Citadel company was absorbed into Games Workshop. In 1984, Games Workshop ceased distributing its products in the USA through Hobby Games Distributors and opened its Games Workshop (US) office. Games Workshop (US), and Games Workshop in general, went through a large growth phase in the late 80s and early 90s. Issue 126 of the White Dwarf (June, 1990) stated the company had over 250 employees and advertised for a number of senior management roles as well as trade, manufacturing and retail staff. Following a management buyout in December 1991 the company refocused on their most lucrative lines, namely their miniature wargame Warhammer Fantasy Battle (WFB) and Warhammer 40,000 (WH40K) lines. The retail chain refocussed on a younger, more family-oriented market. The change of direction was a great success with a rising share price and growing profits, in spite of the fact that it lost the company much of its old, loyal fanbase. The complaints of these old customers led a breakaway group of GW employees to publish Fantasy Warlord in competition with GW, but this met with little success. Games Workshop expanded in Europe, the USA, Canada and Australia opening new branches and organizing events. The company was floated on the London Stock Exchange in October 1994. In October 1997, all UK based operations were relocated to the current HQ in Lenton, Nottingham. This site now houses the corporate HQ, the White Dwarf offices, mail order, and the creative hub. By the end of the decade, though, the company was having problems with falling profits being blamed on collectible card games such as Magic: The Gathering and Pok\u00e9mon. It was realised that the targeted 12 and under age group was not an appropriate market to be aiming towards, and the company's focus was redirected. Template:Fact In recent years, Games Workshop has been attempting to create a dual approach that will appeal to both older, loyal customers while still attracting the younger audience. This has seen the creation of initiatives such as the \"Fanatic\" range that supports more marginal lines with a lower cost trading model (the Internet is used widely in this approach, to collect ideas and playtest reports). Games Workshop has also contributed to designing and making games and puzzles for the popular television series The Crystal Maze. The miniature wargames the company promotes are considered to be a welcome substitute to those young people mostly immersed in videogaming. Some view it as a learning experience that cultivates artistic talent as well as resource management skills, and that the hobby reminds people of more traditional mediums of entertainment, harking back to simple toy soldiers. The release of Games Workshop's third core miniature wargame, The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game (LoTR SBG), in 2000 signalled their intention to capture the younger audience with a simple, yet effective and flexible, combat system.Template:Cite-needed Other key innovations have been to harmonise their core products, and to branch out into new areas of growth. The acquisition of Sabretooth Games (card games), the creation of The Black Library (literature), and their work with THQ (computer games) have all enabled the company to diversify into new areas which have brought old gamers back into the fold; plus introduced the games to a whole new audience.Licensing  In conjunction with the production of cinematic adaptation of The Lord of the Rings, Games Workshop acquired the rights to produce a skirmish wargame based on the films, and also on the novels by J.R.R. Tolkien. The rights to produce a roleplaying game version of the films were sold to another firm, Decipher, Inc. Though they had the rights to produce a Battle of Five Armies game, the rights to the one-inch scale normally used by Games Workshop were already owned by another company. For this reason, the game was done in 10 mm scale for the normal warriors, and \"heroic\" scale for the named characters. Games Workshop has not acquired the rights to The Silmarillion, which is currently the exclusive property of the Tolkien Estate. However, they were somehow permitted to use Eorl the Young and Kham\u00fbl the Easterling (from Unfinished Tales) in their recently-released The Two Towers and A Shadow in the East Supplements. [1]Games Workshop Group PLC  Games Workshop has expanded into several divisions/companies producing products related to the Warhammer universe. The group reported sales of \u00a3136,650,000 sterling in 2005 and employs around 3200 [2]. Sales have decreased for the fiscal year ending in May 2006. \"For the fiscal year ended 28 May 2006, Games Workshop plc's revenues decreased 16% to \u00a3115.2M. Net income decreased 78% to \u00a32M. Revenues reflect a decrease in sales from Continental Europe, United Kingdom, Asia Pacific and The Americas geographic divisions\"[3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]Miniatures games Current Core Games  The following games are in production and widely available.\"Specialist\" games  The following games are considered \"specialist\" and are not necessarily available in Games Workshop stores. They are however available through mail order and are supported by the specialist games division of Games Workshop. Note also that some of these games (e.g. Necromunda) are available only as rules and miniatures, not in the \"boxed set\" form that they originally took. They are all set within one of the universes of the main games. The rules are also offered as a free download from the Specialist Games website. These games are aimed at the \"veteran\" gamers. These are gamers who are more experienced in the core games produced by Games Workshop. This is because the rules and the style of play are often more in-depth than the core games.Warhammer Fantasy Universe Warhammer 40,000 Universe Lord Of The Rings Universe Warhammer Historical Out of print Warhammer Fantasy Universe Warhammer 40,000 Universe Licensed games  These games were not made by Games Workshop but used similar-style models, artwork and concepts. These games were made by mainstream toy companies and available in standard toy and department stores rather than just in Games Workshop and speciality gaming stores.Role playing games  Several of the miniatures games (e.g. Inquisitor) involve a role playing element, however Games Workshop has in the past published role playing games set within the Warhammer universe. Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay was first published in 1986 and returned to print with a new edition on March 29 2005. It is being published by Black Industries[9], part of GW's fiction imprint BL Publishing. BI has also announced a brand new game, Warhammer 40,000 Roleplay, to be published in several parts starting Fall 2007.Out of print Board games  Games Workshop had a strong history in boardgames development, alongside the miniatures and RPGs. Confusingly, several may have had roleplaying elements, or for that matter had miniatures included or produced.Out of print Computer Games  Games Workshop produced and published several ZX Spectrum games in the early years, not all of which were based in the usual Warhammer settings Many computer games have been produced by third parties based on the Warhammer universes owned by the firm. These include: (Miniature game they are based on is included in parentheses after the game name)In development  As of January 2006, there are also some future games in development:Worldwide Campaigns  Template:Main article Games Workshop has run numerous 'Worldwide Campaigns' for its three core game sysyems. In each campaign, players are invited to submit the results of games played within a certain time period. The collation of these results provides a result to the campaign's scenario, and often goes on to impact the fictional and gameplay development of the fictional universe. Although in the past, campaign results had to be posted to the UK to be counted, the more recent campaigns have allowed result submission via the Internet. Each Warhammer campaign has had a new codex published with the rules for special characters or \"incomplete\" army lists. Below are listed the Games Workshop Worldwide Campaigns (the fictional universe the Campaign was set in follows in brackets):Events  There are yearly Games Day events held by Games Workshop which feature the Golden Demon painting competitionOther media  Many novels, artbooks and comics have also been produced based on the Warhammer universes, published by the Black Library.Miniatures  Games Workshop originally produced miniature figures via an associated, originally independent, company called Citadel Miniatures while the main company concentrated on retail. The distinction between the two blurred after Games Workshop stores ceased to sell retail products by other manufacturers, and Citadel was effectively merged back into Games Workshop.Magazines  Games Workshop's best known magazine is White Dwarf, which in the UK has now passed over 320 issues. Nine different international editions of White Dwarf are currently published, with different material, in five languages. Originally a more general roleplaying magazine, since around issue 100 White Dwarf has been devoted exclusively to the support of Games Workshop properties. Games Workshop also published Fanatic Magazine in support of their Specialist Games range, but it was discontinued after issue 10, though it lives on in electronic form. The electronic form, known as \"Fanatic Online\" was originally released weekly, and contained 3 downloadable articles, but around November 2006 it changed to a monthly schedule. The first monthly edition, December 2006 still only contained 3 articles, though it is hoped that more articles will be in forthcoming issues. Fanatic was preceded by a number of newsletters, devoted to the particular games. There was also the Citadel Journal, intended as a \"deeper\" magazine for modelling enthusiasts and more experienced gamers. It often featured unusual rules and armies, and was occasionally used as an outlet for test rules. Under some editors, they also published fan fiction and fan art. This is no longer published. For a brief period in the mid-1980s GW took over publication of the Fighting Fantasy magazine Warlock from Puffin Books. The magazine turned into a general introductory gaming magazine but was discontinued after issue 13. There is also a fortnightly series called \"Battle Games in Middle Earth\", which comes with a free Lord of the Rings SBG miniature. Though the miniatures were made by Games Workshop, the magazine itself was written and published by De Agostini. It is published in Ireland, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, France, Germany, Spain, Austria, Australia, New Zealand, and Poland. The magazine became more popular than the publishers had anticipated, and the deadline has been extended several times and ended on Pack 91. Battle Games in Middle Earth was reported as being the biggest selling part works magazine in De Agostinis history.Comments and criticisms  Template:Unreferenced Template:NPOV-section Games Workshop receive some criticism over various aspects of their games and business practices, some such criticisms are that the rules systems currently in production are increasingly being simplified and aimed at younger gamers with an eye to their disposable income, while offering less to more experienced players. As evidence, long-term gamers point to the first edition of the Warhammer 40,000 rules which functioned much like a role playing game by using a 3rd player to act as a game master. In 2003, Michael Sherwin, the company's finance director, stated that \"A hobby game takes a whole day to play... is less about instant gratification\" . Current third and fourth edition rules allow you to play a tournament sized 1500 point game (an average size) in under 2 hours. An RPG.net Review as early as 1998 felt that the third edition movement rules, in which all units of a given type move at exactly the same speed, were a tad boring and the close combat rules were confusing and unrealistic, if a lot faster. The same review called the army selection lists severely incomplete and simplified, and referred to \"a lot of confusion and silliness\" with what it felt were unnecessarily simplified lumping-together of weapon types. This was typified with the release of the current Codex: Space Marines, which prompted outrage from many veteran gamers on the now defunct internet forums.Template:Cite-needed In contrast to criticism of the two Warhammers' game system, Games Workshop's newest system, The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game, has achieved acclaim as being the most realistic and flexible of the three core games. [10] Unlike Warhammer, time taken to play the game can be done much shorter as a result of the more flexible scale of battles (Warhammer 40,000 has an average of 1,500 points per game, while Warhammer Fantasy has 2000 points per game, but The Lord of the Rings is usually played with either 500 or 600 points per game). It lacks some of the more complicated rules of the other two systems (for example, the miniatures are not necessarily locked in formation), making, according to White Dwarf magazine, the game the easiest to learn, but \"the hardest to master\". However, in 2002, White Dwarf magazine itself reported the Games Workshop's surprise at gamers' lukewarm reaction to the Lord of the Rings game system, in particular the amount of column space the LoTR game was starting to take up - detracting from the amount of coverage received by the more popular 40K and Warhammer. In the same article, editor Guy Haley stated that despite the views and requirements of White Dwarf readers, the magazine would continue to feature the LoTR game system and in fact would probably increase the amount of coverage. Around that time the magazine was printed as if it were two different publications joined together, one for LoTR and another for 40K and WH. They were joined in such a way as to require the reader to turn the magazine upside-down to read the different sections. This format was dropped after about 6 to 8 issues. Template:Cite-needed In 2005 Games Workshop massively cut down support for the entire 'Specialist Games' ranges to concentrate on the core games for 40k, Fantasy and Lord of the Rings. Template:Cite-needed The dedicated specialist games magazine called Fanatic was cancelled after only 10 issues and now updates to these systems are managed by the specialist games website. However, the rules to most of these games are available for free as living rulebooks on the site and Fanatic magazine has continued, first as a weekly online magazine, then from November 2006, as a monthly online magzine. Also, the Games Workshop's own publishing house, the Black Library, no longer produces its bi-monthly Inferno! magazine, which was a short story anthology set in the 40K and Warhammer universes. Inferno! offered new writers a chance to have their work published and often led to more work for the published writer including more stories and even novels. The Black Library continues to run twice-yearly short story competitions through its website, offering half a dozen winners a place in a published anthology alongside established writers. Some GW fans consider the price of GW products excessive. The 'Space Marine Tactical Squad' boxed set, a staple of the game system, was released in 1998 at \u00a310 but in early 2006 sold for \u00a318, a price rise well in advance of inflation. Large tank models and large monsters have also seen their prices rise from \u00a325 to \u00a335. Non-miniature products that Games Workshop sell can often be bought elsewhere at much lower prices - particularly paints (which cost \u00a32.00 for 12 ml) and other craft items. As early as 2001, the Qualiport educational share portfolio felt that Games Workshop has A distinct lack of worthwhile industry competitors; given the requirement to find not only products but also opponents, anyone interested in wargaming as a hobby has no practical choice but to buy Games Workshop products. Discussion of Games Workshop's business practices and prices is notably banned from their forums (the forums are intended purely for the discussion of the game and hobby, rather than the economic aspect), as is linking to any other commercial websites. In June 2006, the company also closed down the forum dedicated to discussion of White Dwarf magazine, unsatisfied with the overall tone. Template:Cite-needed As of November 15th, all of Games Workshop's core game forums were closed down, with no replacement announced as of yet.References See also External links  Template:Warhammer Fantasy Template:The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game Template:Warhammer 40,000de:Games Workshop fr:Games Workshop it:Games Workshop nl:Games Workshop no:Games Workshop pl:Games Workshop fi:Games Workshop sv:Games WorkshopVictorian Science Fiction  Victorian Science Fiction: A wargaming and role playing genre (or period).

Up to 2166 the prefix was CNS (for Confederation Navy Ship), but an Admirality decision to change to RNS was reached as a compromise with the hardline Royalist faction who actually wanted a return to old HMS (His/Her Majesty's Ship) which had been dropped in the late 2090's. NAC- registered merchant shipping is prefixed MSS for Merchant Star Ship. The National emblem for the Royal Navy is a stylised \"A\" symbol with echoes of the old United Kingdom flag, in the traditional red, white and blue.History and Organisation  The NAC Royal Navy is a direct descendent of the British RN, and proudly maintains many of the traditions of the senior service. The amalgamation of the British, Canadian and US Navies (Surface Fleets), when then Anglian Confederation was formed in 2057 brought many American and Canadian naval practices into the new force, but the three nations' long history of co-operation served to make the intregration a relatively easy one. The US Military had operated primitive in-system space warships since the early 2020's, and the development of the the jump drive in the 2060's led the NAC RN to start a programme of FTL warship construction to support and protect their colonial expansion. The first true combat starship was the HMS Thunderer, launched from the lunar orbital shipyard on July 10th 2076. The Royal Navy in the 2180's is divided into Core Command, which operates the NAC Fleet units still based within the Sol, Barnard and Centarus systems, Defence Command (also known as the Home Fleet) that operates in the Inner Colonies and is tasked with protection of the NAC's Capital on Albion, and Outworld Command that operates throughout the far-flung NAC Colonial possessions. The ground arm of the Navy is the Royal Marines, elements of which are divided between the three Space Commands. Training Command and the Royal Naval Reserve are run as seperate organisational structures, which both contributing ships and manpower to any of the active-duty Commands in times of need. Service in all branches of the NAC armed forces is on a volunteer basis except in the most extreme circumstances, and personnel morale is generally very high. The RN encourages pride in the history and traditions of the Navy, and conditions aboard NAC Ships are as comfortable as possible within the constraints of warship design and function.Ship design doctrine  The Royal Navy employs largely general-purpose ships (with the exception of the Fighter Carrier classes), using a broad mix of weapons and systems - beam batteries, pulse torpedoes and some salvo missile systems. They have some specialied designs such as minelaying and sweeping, planetary bombardment and such, but the majority of fleet unit are versatile multi-role ships. Energy screens are the primary passive defence, through som hull armour is also employed especially on the heavier units. Mobility is generally average-to-good. Fighter operations doctrine is to base them on specialised carriers, which rely primarily on supporting ships for their defence. Royal Marine Corps Royal Naval BrigadeNAC NAC - The new Anglian Confederation  Arguably the largest and most powerful (but not by much) of the \"Big Four\" super-powers in the GZGverse. The \"Anglian Confederation\" was formed in 2057 as the UK, Canada and the remains of the US united in a federal super-state under the Crown, at the conclusion of the Second American Civil War. Gained control of Mexico and all of Central American in 2072 at the conclusion of the first War of the Americas. Conquered all of South America by 2100 after the LLAR was defeated in the second War of the Americas, which started only two years earlier. Renamed the \"New Anglian Confederation\" in 2136 when its Constitution was re-written to include all related colonies as independent members.

STARGUARD -- THE GAME THAT WOULD NOT DIE!  STARGUARD, the game is 38 years old as of 2007. It is the oldest commercially available miniature Science Fiction game. It began as a simple skirmish game inspired by the book STARSHIP TROOPERS by Robert A. Heinlein. Since that modest beginning it has grown to a frill fledged science fiction skirmish game involving not only jump troops and other interstellar infantry, but tanks, robots and all sorts of futuristic war machines. STARGUARD is a proven system; tested in thousands of games world wide. The background universe and futuristic science of STARGUARD is particularly believable and entertaining; allowing the players considerable flexibility and opportunity to use their own imaginations. There are many long time fans who began playing as children who are now teaching their own children this fascinating game. There are over twenty human and alien groups and races in the STARGUARD universe and it is growing all the time. John McEwan created the first STARGUARD miniatures 38 years ago and is still going strong. All the races and groups participating in the game are represented with high quality 25mm figures. The entire STARGUARD figure line is still supported by Reviresco, www.tin-soldier.com so if you started years ago in your youth, the exact same figures are available to fill out your forces. Many robots, vehicles and support elements are also available. Cut and fold cardstock models of small spaceships, ground vehicles and buildings will help you complete the background of your science fiction universe. STARGUARD is set in a rich science-fictional universe where humanity has spread to the stars and settled on dozens of worlds. As prophesied since the days before space travel, men met intelligent beings among the stars. Some of these were friendly and cooperative. Others were not. Conflicts weren't limited to battles with strangers: men still fought men over territory, power and wealth. Learn about and help make the history of humanity's exploration of the Orion Arm and its conflicts with the Ralnai, Dreenoi and Eli. STARGUARD battles can take place at any time in the future history: however, five historical periods are of particular interest. The Diaspora: 2051 A.D. - 2120 A.D., Tech Level 6.1 The mass exodus of humanity to the stars led to conflicts between dissident and religious groups over choice planets, and between colonists and unfriendly natives. The period was a time of anarchy, which saw raids by the Eli and human pirate raider bands. The Imperial Age: 2120 A.D.- 2160 A.D , Tech Level 6.1 -6.3 Covers the conflicts between the Terran Imperium and colony worlds fighting for independence. The Star Wars: 2236 A.D.- 2240 A.D., 2249 A.D.-2260 A.D., Tech level 6.5 After the founding of the Federation, which incorporated most human colonies, humanity found itself in conflict with the Dreenoi and the Ralnai. The liberation of Tellus and the Ameron Rebellion took place in this time. The Commercial Wars: 2262 A.D - 2295 A.D. Tech Level 6.6 After the exhausted Ralnai gave up its effort to gobble up the worlds of the Federation, a period of widespread but low-level conflict began. It pitted every major and minor star-faring power against the other in hundreds of skirmishes over mineral resources, trade routes and colonizable planets. The Founding of the Empire: 2301 A.D- 2350 A.D., Tech Level 6.7-6.8 This period is unwritten history and covers the consolidation of the galaxy under the Galactic Empire. It is a good period in which to set a full-blown campaign combining ground battles, deep-space \"naval\" operations and diplomatic intrigue.NAC Military NAC Military  The NAC Military is divided into the Space Navy (with it Royal Marine Ground Units), the Army and the Local Volunteer Regiments. New Anglian Confederation Space NavyNSL  NSL - New Swabian League Founded in 2101 as Germany, Austria, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and several other East and Central European states broke away from the United Federal Europe in response to what was perceived as French domination. These countries immediately formed the New Swabian League, and very shortly thereafter came into direct conflict with the remaining UFE nations, now joined together in the FSE. The NSL has remained an \"ally\" of the NAC, engaging in wars with the NAC against the ESU and FSE on more than one occasion.FT Timeline  FT Timeline 1992 Creation of the Commonwealth of Independent States from the Soviet Union. 2014 Britain withdraws from the EC following the Spanish invasion of Gibraltar and EC refusal to take military or economic action. 2018 Nicholas III crowned Czar in St Petersburg as the Romanovs return to Russia.

Borneo is overrun by Indonesian forces. 2045 Heavy fighting on the Sino-Siberian border as the Beijing Government presses long redundant border claims against a financially and politically bankrupt Russia. 2046 South Korea falls to a lightning strike by North Korea and China. 2047 A Beijing sponsored coup in Moscow results in the return of Communist government to Russia and several of the Commonwealth Republics. The Czar and a sizeable military force flee to the Ukraine, who along with Byelorussia and the Baltic States remain free of the Communist shackle, as the EC intimates to Beijing that further Communist expansion West will not be tolerated, whatever the cost. The Communist states then create the Eurasian Union. The remaining Commonwealth States create the Romanov Hegemony, realising that divided they will be picked off by the Eurasian Union in time. 2049 The US economy collapses, followed by the Federal Government as President Amy Koslowski is assassinated in the bombing of the White House. General Parham declares the creation of a military government. Many states ignore the military proclamation, violently opposing the armed forces attempts to assume control. 2050 Parham requests UN military involvement to restore order in the US. The request is refused. The military government turns towards Britain and Canada for help. The \"Pacification\" of the former USA begins. The US inspired Organisation of American States collapses and is replaced by the Brazilian/Argentinian dominated League of Latin American Republics. The LLAR intimates that it will use force to recover territories occupied by \"Colonial Powers\". Britain advises that it will use any weapons in its arsenal to protect its subjects in the Falkland Islands. The LLAR backs down. The Philippines are conquered by Indonesia and assimilated into the new Indonesian Commonwealth. Japanese naval units act to protect the Gilderstein Foundation\u2019s installation from Indonesian aggression. In response to the growing Indonesian threat, Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and a number of South Sea Island states create the Oceanic Union. 2051 The Eurasian Union crosses the Himalayas and invades the Indian sub-continent. 2053 The Indonesian Commonwealth invades and conquers Burma and Thailand. 2054 The remainder of Indo-China falls to the forces of the Indonesian Commonwealth. 2057 Britain, Canada and the United States unite under the Crown and create the Anglian Confederation. Admiral Dewsbury is appointed Lord Governor of the territory previously known as the United States of America. In the confusion of the end of the 2nd Civil War, the LLAR declares that the AC has no mandate to rule over the ex-Hispano-US peoples and decrees California, New Mexico and Texas as LLAR territory under foreign occupation and launches an invasion of these areas. The fifteen year War of the Americas starts. 2059 The Gilderstein Foundation\u2019s L5 Lab disappears from orbit. 2062 The Foundation reveals the true nature of the disappearance of the L5 Lab. The Islamic Federation and PAU clash in North-East Africa over water rights. The EC sponsor a peace initiative backed by a threat of force. 2063 The first trans-solar probe is launched to (and returns from) Barnard\u2019s Star. 2067 The Gilderstein Foundation sends the first manned FTL mission out of the Solar System. 2069 Both the Anglian Federation and the EC launch FTL craft and begin the colonisation of space. 2070 With help from the EC, the Islamic Federation, the PAU and the Romanov Hegemony all launch FTL craft. 2072 The LLAR sues for peace in the War of the Americas and cedes all territories in North and Central America to the Anglian Confederation. The LLAR looks to space as a means of expansion. The Eurasian Union launches its first FTL ship and renames itself the Eurasian Solar Union. 2075 The LLAR launch their first FTL craft, as does the Indonesian Commonwealth. 2096 Founding of \"New Israel\" on a garden world in the Epsilon Indi system. 2098 Conflict again between the Anglian Confederation and the LLAR as border clashes escalate into all out war. Within two years the LLAR loses all possessions on Earth. Survivors of the League government and its supporters flee to the small Brazilian colony on Santa Rico. 2099 First settlement of Albion by Anglian Confederation colonists. 2101 The struggling and unstable United Federal Europe finally disintegrates as Germany, Austria and several East European states agree the formation of the Neu Swabian League (NSL) in protest at continued French domination of the EC. In response, France and the remaining members of the EC (notably Italy and Spain) dissolve that organisation and reform as the Federal Stats Europa (FSE). Very soon, border incidents between the NSL and FSE about territorial claims on Earth and the other settled worlds intensify into open warfare. Initially the war goes well for the FSE as they overrun the NSL Inner Colony settlements of Trelleborg and Flensberg, followed by the taking of the Outworld colonies of Wittenberge, Kecel and Lienz after brave resistance from their colonial militias. On Earth, Baden Wurttemberg, Bayern and parts of the Rhineland swiftly fall to FSE armoured thrusts. Three years of intermittent warfare ends with an Anglian Confederation sponsored peace plan. 2102 Further FSE advances into Germany falter as NSL forces under General Janos Matthias halt the FSE armour at the battle of Breznice. An attempted counter-thrust by NSL units is a bit of a non-event, only succeeding in regaining territory up to the Danube. In late 2102 the Netherlands (which had been at best an unwilling \"associate member\" of the FSE since the EC's collapse) breaks all ties with the FSE; refusing an offer of alliance from the NSL, the Dutch reassert their independence and eject all FSE influences from their homeland and colonial possessions. 2103 While the FSE/NSL war on Earth and the Inner Colonies stagnates, the battles in the Outworlds intensify. The NSL launches commando raids and planetary assaults against a number of FSE colonies and bases, but with only limited success; while the hit-and-run strikes caused significant damage to many FSE installations, the NSL abilities to mount full-scale assaults proved sorely lacking. 2104 The treaty of Saarbrucken brings a conclusion to the FSE/NSL war, confirming territorial boundaries on Earth and the Inner Colonies and establishing spheres of influence in the Outworlds. The peace accord is sponsored by the UN and the Anglian Confederation, and although neither of the protagonists is really happy with the outcome they are both too economically weakened by the war to protest effectively. 2110 Air attacks by Indonesian Commonwealth forces herald the start of their war with the Oceanic Union over Papua New Guinea. The low-intensity war runs the Indonesians' way for much of the first year, as they manage to inflict a crushing defeat on the Oceanic 6th Infantry Division at Aitape and go on to take the Long Islands, Admiralty Islands and establish a beach-head on the New Islands. The Indonesian advance is finally stopped in Southern Papua, at the battle of the Mouths of the Fly River. Generally a low intensity war, it is notable for the widespread use of Grav vehicles as major combat weapons for the first time on Earth. 2111 Oceanic forces seize the initiative and launch an assault on Indonesian territory with two armoured and three infantry divisions. Quickly taking Traigan, Jamdena and Timor, the Oceanic advance halts after the Battle of Ramang in the South Banda Sea, and the war enters another quiet phase and peace negotiations commence. Despite a rather half-hearted and ineffective attempt at a renewed offensive by the Indonesians late in the year, the war grinds to an inconclusive close. 2112 The Sydney Accord ends the Papua New Guinea War. 2123 Islamic Federation and ESU forces clash on Earth as the ESU massacres many Muslims in an anti-Islamic pogrom on the Indian sub-continent. Most of the action is limited to cross-border raids and artillery duels; frantic UN diplomatic efforts prevent full-scale escalation. The Beijing government, appreciative of the fact that religious persecution has no place in the multi-cultural Union, deals harshly with the Hindu officials who sanctioned the pogrom. 2124 Expanding interests on the colony worlds and the difficulty of maintaining strong centralised control force some liberalisation within the ESU. Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia petition to join the ESU as \"economic partners\", considering themselves to have been poorly treated by the NSL. 2127 The balance of power within the ESU shifts away from Chinese domination as the Union government is moved from Earth to the mainly Russian-settled Nova Moskva. One hundred years after the effective destruction of Israel by Arab terrorist groups, the Jewish government on the colony of New Israel renews the pledge of never-ending war against the anti-Zionists. To date this \"war\" has largely been the province of New Israeli Intelligence and Special Forces, but Rabbi Avraham Yoffe's public statement that the Jewish state would take each and every opportunity to avenge the destruction of their original homeland actually marked the start of Operation Jericho, during which New Israeli Interface and Airborne units assaulted and destroyed several Islamic bases on the Inner Colonies. 2128 LLAR mercenary forces (the San Deseado Interface Brigade), hired by the Indonesian Commonwealth to protect their installations on the disputed Caroline Islands, clash with New Anglian forces against the will of their employers. In a desperate attempt to conciliate with the Anglians, who are threatening retribution, the Indonesians execute the entire LLAR Brigade. Understandably furious at this, the LLAR strikes at the Indonesian settlement on Easter, marking the start of what becomes known as the \"Mercenary War\" (as both sides employ large numbers of mercenary and foreign volunteer contingents to complement their own limited forces). The next four years see a very scrappy and inconclusive war fought out, the only real winners being the bank balances of the various mercenary units. The Islamic Federation and PAU clash over spheres of influence in space. The FSE enforces a peaceful solution. 2129 Dutch mercenaries of the Van Koost Armoured Legion, working for the Indonesians, recapture the Commonwealth's settlement of Easter, defeating LLAR regular forces and a Turkish mercenary unit in the process. A Swiss strike force employed by the LLAR in turn raids a major Indonesian logistics centre in Manila on Earth, but is repelled by the local forces and Japanese mercenary troops; the Swiss make use of nerve agents to cover their withdrawal, causing heavy casualties to the Japanese and bringing severe protests in the UN assembly. 2130 Shi'ite fundamentalists declare independence from the Islamic Federation on their Outworld settlements of Abu Haman and Sad Al Bari. Saudi attempts to regain control of these colonies fail as troops of the 2nd Islamic Legion sent to suppress the rebellion switch sides after landfall and join the fundamentalists under the banner of Mullah Saeed ibn Aamir. The two colonies declare the formation of the Saeed Khalifate and, in an effort to raise much needed hard currency soon begin to utilise their armed forces as mercenary units for hire. Over the next few years, the Khalifate's mercenaries are to earn themselves the reputation of being among the toughest units in Human space. 2131 Israeli and Islamic mercenaries clash with each on Easter despite both having been hired by the Indonesians; both forces' contracts are promptly revoked, and several Commonwealth Defence Ministry staff responsible for the hirings are severely punished for their lack of foresight. 2132 ESU and Anglian forces skirmish on Chi Draconis VII as both powers continue to expand their colonial settlement programmes. Over the next five years such \"border skirmishes\" become more frequent, especially in the minor colonies and Outworlds. The Mercenary War is finally brought to an end with the signing of the Mercenary Charter on the Dutch-settled world of Freisland. The Charter, as well as finalising the LLAR/Commonwealth dispute with heavy reparations being paid by the Indonesians over the San Deseado Brigade incident, lays out a code to which all mercenary units and their employers are expected to adhere. All signatories to the Charter, which include most nations and blocs that either supply or employ foreign mercenary troops, agree not to hire any unit that does not comply with the terms of the code. 2133 Radical French separatists in the colony settlements of Bretonneux, Doullens and Compville declare unilateral independence from the FSE. Elements of the Colonial Legion - namely the 1e REP, 5th and 13th DBLC - are sent to quell the insurrection. Despite initial setbacks due to stronger rebel opposition than expected, the Legion troops are finally able to defeat the separatists' main forces; however, resentment among the populations remains high and the Colonial forces are drawn into a prolonged and dirty guerilla war with remaining local troops. 2135 The Anglian Confederation moves its Parliament to Albion, which now has population almost as large as England thanks to massive immigration and engineered population growth programmes. The reigning monarch, King Charles V, divides his time between palaces in England, Vermont, Ottawa and Albion. 2136 The Anglian Confederation renames itself the New Anglian Confederation and revises its Constitution to include all related colonies as independent members. 2137 The Eurasian Solar Union declares war against the New Anglian Confederation due to \"the hostile actions and intents of the imperialists\". Five years of intense warfare known as the First Solar War follows throughout the inner colonies and the Outworlds. ESU forces invade NAC settlements on Salzburg, but are repelled with heavy losses after fierce fighting. The important NAC Outworld base on Lancelot is taken by an ESU Naval Infantry Assault Division, and an inconclusive skirmish between NAC and ESU space units off Grendel signals the start of major Naval offensives by both sides. 2138 The NAC launch Operation Jester, a counter-thrust against the Eurasians; ESU possessions on Mariana and Trelleborg fall rapidly, but an attempt to take the major colony of Chiang is beaten back. An attempt to retake Lancelot also fails with heavy losses to the Anglian 2nd Drop Cavalry. 2139 ESU forces comprising the 15th Guards 'Zhukov' Division and the 135th 'Tyulenev' Division land on Flensberg and invest the Anglian settlement of Faith. The colony, defended only by Local Volunteer Reserve troops and the 3rd Infantry Brigade of the reformed Gurhka Rifles, manages to hold out for nearly nine months until relief forces under General Pauline Chappell arrive and repel the Eurasians. 2140 Operation Season's End results in the NAC seizing the ESU outposts of Mikhailovka and Showyang, both against heavy resistance. 2142 The Accord of Freisland brings the First Solar War to an end, with the Anglians hailing it as a major victory while the ESU licks its wounds and considers its next move. Human space enjoys an all-too-brief period of relative peace. 2143 The United Nations Space Command (UNSC) is formed to forbid space conflict in the Core systems, and provide a peacekeeping force where required in the inner colonies. Pressure by several major powers results in the UNSC having no mandate to operate in the Outworlds, except in a scientific/research capacity. 2145 A surprise strike against the Romanov Hegemony by ESU units heralds the outbreak of the Second Solar War. This time more major powers are quickly dragged into the conflict, with the NAC and NSL supporting the RH against the \"Communist aggression\" while the FSE and the PAU enter the war on the Eurasian side. UNSC presence prevents the war intruding on the Core system, though combat occurs on several inner colonies. 2146 The war escalates as the ESU launches a major campaign dedicated to regaining the possessions lost during the First Solar War. Their occupied colonies on Trelleborg and Showyang are retaken after short but bloody campaigns. On Dnestr, Romanov defenders manage to beat back a joint FSE/PAU invasion force and hold their major towns, but the invaders merely fall back to regroup in the vast outback of this sparsely-settled world. 2147 The ESU finally retake Mikhailovka, and make strike raids against the Anglian settlements of Bifrost and Valhalla. 2148 NAC forces under Admiral Sir Andrew Le Throux instigate Operation Dryland, a surprise attack on the Pan African settled world of Grand Lahou. Despite strong resistance from PAU and FSE Naval units, the Anglian force makes a successful assault and takes the major townships of Bouna and Markounda. 2149 Buoyed by the success of Dryland, the NAC and NSL militaries launch Operation Galahad, a joint strike to regain Lancelot. The ESU defenders, led by General Lech Pawodowski with the 57th Combined Division, beat back attack after attack as NAC and NSL troops are poured into the battle. After seventy days of spirited resistance Pawodowski surrenders with full military honours leading the remaining one hundred and forty survivors of his Division into captivity. 2150 Neu Swabian forces attempt to take the FSE settlement of Di Persano, but are repulsed by System Defence forces before they can approach orbit. A PAU strike force fails to recapture Grand Lahou. 2151 Romanov assault forces land on the ESU colony of Nizhneudinsk and begin a prolonged campaign to capture the major townships. NAC political agents attempt to persuade the Manchu government on Chiang to rise against the ESU, but without success. 2152 Boer Voortrekkers claim a large area of subtropical land on Iylichograd, naming it Neu Transvaal. Operation White Feather is launched in the Chi Draconis system as Anglian forces attempt to remove the Eurasions from the system. Fierce fighting is space and on planet ends in an Anglian defeat from the sheer weight of the defending forces. 2154 The FSE concludes a peace treaty with the NAC/NSL/RH alliance and withdraws from the Second Solar War. The PAU makes a last abortive attempt to retake Grand Lahou before rejoining the peace negotiations. 2155 In a last desperate attempt to change the tide of the war, the ESU assaults the Winchester system with a massive task force. Large troop landings are made on the NAC-held colony, but the Planetary Defence troops hold on stubbornly through Winchester's long and bitter winter. 2156 Anglian Naval units under Rear Admiral Dame Jayne Oppenburger jump into the Winchester system and soundly defeat the ESU fleet; the Eurasian troops on the planet surrender unconditionally following their fleet's virtual destruction. 2157 Following long negotiations, the Second Solar War is finally ended with the Treaty of Khorramshahr. 2159 California and Texas declare themselves independent from the NAC, and claim all rights to the colonies on Austin and Fenris (which they rename New Pasadena). After much diplomatic protest and sabre rattling, plus a few token military strikes, the NAC accepts the declaration and the FCT (Free Cal-Tex) is formed. 2163 Islamic fundamentalists seize power in New Riyadh, murdering the remaining member of the Saudi royal family. Loyalist elements attempt to regain power in a two year civil war, but fail. The Islamic Federation becomes increasingly hostile towards both the NAC and the ESU. 2164 ESU forces on Iylichograd move on the Neu Transvaal colony and claim its mineral resources; the Boer settlers withdraw to the jungle areas and embark on a guerilla war against the occupying Eurasians. 2165 The Third Solar War is heralded by a massive operation by the NAC to regain the worlds left under Eurasian control following the Treaty of Khorramshahr. Early successes falter as the FSE once again allies with the ESU, providing men and material as well as funding to hire mercenary contingents from the LLAR and the Indonesian Commonwealth. 2166 The Third Solar War escalates further as the NSL attacks the bordering FSE frontier. Mercenary forces from New Israel are hired by the NAC. The Romanov Hegemony attacks the ESU and refuses safe passage for Indonesian or LLAR mercenary units through its space. 2168 ESU Naval forces enter the Treralis system and attempt to take the Romanov-held settlement of Tsitsihar; the Eurasian fleet under Admiral Jia Dehuai manages to defeat the system defence forces, but at high cost, leaving the Eurasian assault forces too weak to create a beachhead in the face of fierce resistance from the Planetary defences. 2169 Sponsored by NAC agents, the French separatists in Bretonneux and Doullens overthrow the Federal forces and proclaim the New French Republic. A similar insurrection in Compville fails. 2170 Scandinavian mercenaries employed by the NAC overrun Compville and install the separatists in government; Compville joins the New French Republic, which is still denied any kind of diplomatic recognition by the UN due to FSE pressure. 2171 The war enters a relatively quiet phase, with most protagonists involved in little but minor skirmishing and diplomatic posturing. The major powers use the next few years to consolidate and rebuild their depleted forces, and an uneasy state of \"peace within war\" ensues. 2173 The Sumani IV incident. ESU and NAC peace negotiators are assassinated by an Islamic Federation terrorist attack. Years of distrust between the two powers lead to them blaming each other and a failure to identify the real culprit. The Third Solar War intensifies. 2176 Archaeologists discover the remains of a non-human civilisation on a rim world planet in Indonesian Space. 2177 A sudden ESU fleet attack on the Anglian Nagisa system signals the start of the next \"hot phase\" of the Third Solar War; the Nagisa colony falls quickly, following a warning orbital bombardment from ESU warships. Meanwhile, NSL regulars and Swiss mercenary units strike at FSE settlements on the inner colony of Flensberg. 2179 The colony of Bradley on Fliescher II falls to FSE units under General Henri de Pascalle, despite resistance from the 136th Gloucestershire Regiment that held on for nearly six months. The FSE pours massive reinforcements of armour into Bradley to forestall NAC attempts to regain it. 2181 On Kayleigh, NSL and NAC armoured forces are defeated by LLAR mercenary units; General Heinrich Vortsheimer, leading the Allied troops, is relieved of his command following this ignominious reverse. 2182 The ESU lands Khalifate mercenaries on Tsitsihar to reinforce their offensive against Romanov units in the colony. 2183 Indonesian mercenary units working for the ESU capture NSL possessions on Salzburg. With the aid of the Khalifate troops the ESU finally takes Tsitsihar from the Romanovs. The UNSC Survey Cruisers McCaffrey and Niven fail to return from an Outworld survey (off Lagos IV) on the fringe of PAU space. The UNSC despatches the PeaceForce Cruiser Heitman to investigate, and identifiable debris the Niven is discovered exhibiting obvious signs of battle. No trace is found of either the McCaffrey or any hostiles. All space faring nations deny any involvement in the incident, and public speculation grows that the UN is suppressing information about the unknown aggressors. Later in the year, the PAU Battlecruiser Kinshasa is engaged and destroyed by an unidentified hostile in the New Lusaka system. 2184 Unexplained attacks and incidents increase in frequency, affecting not only PAU space but other nations as well; with the ongoing state of war between the NAC and ESU, much blame is placed by each power on the other. Both blocs, however, begin to realise that something far more important is happening. Late in the year, NAC Fleet Intelligence recovers the first identifiable alien debris following an encounter near Angel II in which a NAC squadron managed to destroy two ships from an attacking alien group. For the first time, Humanity has positive proof that the attackers are another sentient life-form. 2185 The first co-operative action between the ESU and NAC against the Kra\u2019Vak occurs at the Battle of Sulaxar; although tensions still run high (especially in diplomatic circles), the militaries of all the major powers - plus several smaller nations - are coming inexorably together in the face of a much greater threat. On 28.07.85, the UN Assembly declares that a state of war now officially exists between all the nations of Humanity and the race known as the Kra\u2019Vak; the First InterSentient War (rapidly christened the Xeno War by the popular media) has truly begun. 2186 Early in the year, the advances towards joint ESU/NAC response to the Kra\u2019Vak aggression falter when a Eurasian naval unit fails to assist an NAC squadron under attack by alien forces off Caleb. Finally escaping with barely 25% of his force and men, Commodore Farris accuses the ESU of standing off from the action in order to gain control of the Caleb system. The diplomatic repercussions gradually settle, but illustrate the deep distrust that still exists between the major powers. The Kra\u2019Vak offensive gathers momentum and very late in the year reports begin to come in of the first surface assaults by Kra\u2019Vak forces. 2187 The first major success against Kra\u2019Vak ground forces is reported on the NSL Outworld of Rheinhold, where a combined force of NSL and NAC Marines supporting local Militia units manage to beat off an attempted planetary landing by the alien invaders. Rheinhold then survives five months of protracted siege and repeated landing attempts before the Kra\u2019Vak are driven out of the system by the arrival of a large joint task force of NAC, NSL, Dutch and Free Cal-Tex ships. Elsewhere, humanity does not fare so well, and the aliens continue to make inroads toward the core systems. Virtually no information is released to the public concerning what is happening on worlds taken by the Kra'Vak, which causes widespread panic as rumors of massacre and genocide spread. Public opinion on Earth, Centaurus and Barnard swings in favour of pulling all forces back from the Outworlds to defend the core. Such a defensive concept does not find favour with the Military, nor (naturally) with the colonial population. 2188 Contact is made with a second Xenosentient species; the Sa'Vasku send a message to humanity by returning a survivor of the crew of the UNS McCaffrey, arranging a rendezvous that is attended by joint NAC/ESU task force accompanied by a UN ambassador and xenospecialist team. After a very strange and inconclusive (to the humans) meeting between the UN delegation and the Sa'Vasku contact constructs, mankind is still not sure if it has found new friends, or new enemies. Over the following years of the war, Sa'Vasku ships and fleets turn up apparently at random throughout human space, sometimes hostile, sometimes friendly and sometimes just observing; contact with them proves impossible unless they wish to initiate it, and mankind is still no nearer understanding their motives or agenda. 2189 The Kra'Vak push towards the core continues unabated, with mankind scoring only minor successes in space and planetside against the onslaught. Late in the year, a rapid thrust by Kra'Vak forces deep into Human space is only narrowly defeated when they attack Centaurus, a battle which causes heavy losses to the allied human fleets and great damage to the orbital colonies of the Centaurus system. The appearance of such a large enemy fleet deep within the core pushes all the human nations into closer co-operation in the fight to defeat the Kra'Vak. 2190 A brief lull occurs in the fighting while the Kra'Vak, presumably hurting from the defeat at Centaurus, consolidate their gains in human space and regroup for their next push. Towards the start of 2191 the offensive resumes, but with a steadier and more co-ordinated strategy than the piecemeal strikes of the earlier years. The human forces give ground slowly as the Kra'Vak waves strike at system after system. 2191 First contact between Humanity and the Phalon race, when a Phalon ship is fired on and destroyed by an FSE force in the Rhone system. Other encounters with the Phalons follow, including several retaliatory attacks, until proper communication is finally established and the two races begin to understand something of the other. In the event, diplomatic relations with the Phalons appear almost as unpredictable as with the Sa'Vasku, with different factions within the Conglomerate siding with either Humanity or the Kra'Vak seemingly at a whim. 2192 The Kra'Vak continue their pressure on the Hu'Man. In July 2192 a small Kra'Vak deep penetration force actually slips through Sol's system defenses and reaches as far as Mars orbit, hitting several orbital facilities before the defending fleets can intercept and destroy the invaders. Civilian panic on Earth rises. 2193 It becomes obvious that a major Kra'Vak push into the core, and probably to Sol itself, is very near. In desperation, the UNSC (co-ordinating the defence of the core systems) orders all human forces to withdraw their forces from the colonies to interdict the core worlds. While many units comply, others refuse to abandon their colonial home-systems which are still under attack from Kra'Vak forces. As the New Year approaches, the remnants of the UNSC/allied fleets begin to gather for a last-ditch defence of the core. 2194 While other battles still rage in many of the colonial systems, the Kra'Vak main force arrives at the core. Barnard and the already badly hurt Centaurus are attacked repeatedly by powerful Kra'Vak fleets. In May 2193 the first of the Kra'Vak attacks on the Earth's outer defences begin. The Siege of Sol has started.....NI  This history is non-canon.NI - New Israel  Israel was destroyed in 2027 by Islamic-sponsored nuclear and biological terrorism. A Jewish-funded research organization, the Gilderstein Foundation, was created after this event to explore the possibilities of FTL space travel. They produced the first working FTL stardrives, and very early in the human colonization of space, New Israel was founded on a garden planet in the Epsilon Indi system. While New Israel is not one of the major players in the GZGverse, their presence is nevertheless felt through their high-technology, marketing of very good mercenary troops, and their constant \"war\" on the anti-Zionist forces in the Islamic Federation. Nation: New Israel (Eretz Israel Chadashah) Symbol/Flag: Kaniza illusion Star of David (white) on midnight blue field or star field. Summary: An independent Jewish state founded by early interstellar pioneers and remnants of the destroyed terrestrial state of Israel.New Israel Timeline  Current Politics New Israel is a parliamentary republic spread over five worlds and numerous outposts in three systems. The head of state is the President, elected by the Legislature to a five-year term; the Prime Minister, elected by the voters, is head of government; the Legislature is the unicameral Knesset, with 120 members. The four largest colonies have smaller \u201cstate\u201d versions of the national government with Governor, Ministers of State, and Knesset M\u2019dina. The national government is currently dominated by the Bitachon (security) party. Other major parties include N\u2019kam (vengeance), which is rapidly on the wane, Chalutzim (pioneers), Tzirim (labor), and Derech Or, (the way of light), the largest religious party. The current \u201cSecurity Government\u201d has enjoyed a broad coalition of support since replacing the \u201cVengeance Government\u201d in 2158. New Israel military is primarily concerned with the safety and security of the people. New Israel is on average more religious than Old Israel, but religious and secular power blocs get along better than in the past. The ultra-religious hold small, though sometimes lopsided power, as do the pure secularists. The lessons of history, however are burned into the national and social psyche, and most divisions are quickly cast aside to counter perceived threats. The intelligence network is extensive, and government supported and sanctioned mercenary groups act as revenue sources, additional training, ready reserves, and information gatherers in the core systems and beyond. One of the first human colonies to become truly self-sufficient, NI has an isolationist bent, not wanting to get nationally involved in the affairs of others. However, the government is on friendly terms with NAC, OU, and PAU (though PAU is occasionally a trade competitor), neutral towards NSL, FSE and most minor powers, cool with ESU and IC and hostile to IF. NI policy towards IF focuses on denying the IF the ability to make war on NI, classifying most IF FTL capable tugs and all FTL military ships of Destroyer class and higher as imminent security threats. Symbiotic research, technical, and trade alliances exist with a number of Japanese corporations.Economics  Main exports are colonial technology and hardware, including harsh-environment survival (20% GDP). Custom agricultural, bioengineering, terraforming, and other colonial/pioneer equipment (20%).

China conquered territory in Russia and much of Asia, starting in 2045. South Korea fell to China and North Korea in 2046. A coup in 2047 in Russia, sponsored by China, led to a return of Communist government to Russia and several of the other CIS nations. The Communist states then formed the Eurasian Union. The remaining CIS states (including part of Russia, the Ukraine, etc) formed the Romanov Hegemony under the deposed Czar in response. The EU crossed the Himalayas and invaded the Indian sub-continent in 2051. Launching its first FTL space craft in 2072 (several years behind the other major powers) the EU renamed itself the Eurasian Solar Union. Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia petitioned to join the ESU as \"economic partners\" in 2124, considering themselves to have been poorly treated by the NSL and seeing a trend toward some liberalization in ESU policies (as a result of the difficulties of administering strong central control over the vast distances of space). The balance of power swung away from the Chinese in 2127 as the ESU capital moved to the mainly Russian-settled Nova-Moskva.FSE  FSE - Federal Stats Europa Founded in 2101 as the foundering United Federal Europe splits. Germany, Austria and several East European states formed the NSL in response to \"French domination of the UFE\", and the FSE was created in response as France and the other remaining UFE members (notably Spain and Italy) joined in common interest. Within a very short time, border skirmishes between the two groups led to open warfare on both Earth and the other European-controlled worlds. This conflict lasted for three years, ending with an Anglian Confederation and UN co-sponsored peace plan.Sci-fi wargaming  Full Thrust STARGUARD_-_The_game_that_would_not_die! Sci-fi Scenarios HaloWarhammer Ancient Battles  Warhammer Ancient Battles (often referred to as \"WAB\") is a tabletop wargame produced by Games Workshop's \"Warhammer Historical\" imprint. It is a rulebook for historical wargames, based on the popular Warhammer Fantasy Battle.Playing the Game  Games of Warhammer Ancient Battles replicate battles between armies of history. Players collect armies of miniatures, which are produced by a number of manufacturers. The game is played on a table laid out with model scenery to look like a battlefield, on which the regiments of miniatures are maneuvered. Large numbers of dice are rolled together at once to resolve combat, but using appropriate tactics makes a big difference towards winning the game.Development  Several of Games Workshop's staff had begun experimenting with using Warhammer rules to play historical games before Warhammer Ancient Battles was written, and Wargames Illustrated magazine included some articles they had written on the subject. This led to them developing Warhammer Ancient Battles as a spare-time project, and it was published under the name \"Warhammer Historical Wargames\". Perhaps because of its well-known predecessor, Warhammer Ancient Battles proved popular among wargamers, and Games Workshop eventually brought the project back in-house, with Rob Broom running the \"Warhammer Historical\" department and promoting an increasing range of books. The game rules were heavily based on the fifth edition of Warhammer, with magic dropped and more detail added for ancient weapons and formations. The two games have developed in different directions since. Warhammer Ancient Battles is still in its first edition, but modifications to the core rules have been included in some of the more recent supplements. Following the success of Warhammer Ancient Battles Warhammer Historical branched out into other areas:Supplements  The core rulebook includes army lists for \"Early Imperial Roman\" and \"Barbarian\" armies. A range of supplementary books has been released to provide more army lists, each focusing on a particular period and place.Community  The game is supported by a high-traffic discussion group on Yahoo! Groups, the WABlist, and Warhammer Historical Forums (the former a non-Yahoo message board). In addition another group WABMedievalBattles focuses on the medieval period. In the UK, the \"Warhammer Players Society\" organises a yearly \"Grand Tournament\", while Warhammer Historical run a yearly gaming weekend.External links Kra'Vak  Kra'Vak The Kra'Vak, (their name translated as \"People of the Sorrow Killer\"), are clan-based bipedal anthropoids with a mix of reptillian and insectoid features. They communicate with a guttural language that is hard for humans to comprehend thus making relations with them very difficult. Relations are complicated further by the fact that Kra'vak pass through several gender and behavorial stages as they age which make them somewhat unpredictable as members of one stage are more aggressive and territorial than those in another stage. Kra'vak technology is similar to humans, but in some cases they are not as advanced. They favor powerful non-energy based weaponry such as railguns and missiles, and they also lack shield technology.Japan (Corporations)  Japan Maintaining their independence throughout the GZGverse history, they are nevertheless a \"jealously protected\" close ally of the NAC.UN  United Nations Space Command is responsible for maintaining the safety of the home system and core worlds.Royal Naval Brigade  NAC The Royal Naval BrigadeIntroduction  The Royal Naval Brigade is a force of sailors originally trained to protect the Royal Navy whilst ashore or in port. The overstretch of the NAC Army and its concentration on coloniall warfare and the specialisation of the Royal Marines has led to a need for a dedicated force in this role. Units of the RAN Bde can be found scattered around the world garrisoning the Royal Anglian Confederation Space Navy\u2019s bases and now providing ship's troops. In addition to this parts of the RN Bde are deployed to protect the Fleet Aerospace Arm when it is deployed ashore.History  The Royal Brigade traces its roots to the British Royal Naval (later 63rd) Division of World War 1. It was created as an infantry division from surplus reserve sailors and Royal Marines by Winston Churchill in 1914. Its first action at Antwerp, half trained and under-equipped, was a debacle. However in subsequent actions at Gallipolli and on the Western Front the unit won a reputation as a fine fighting division, even winning the grudging respect of the Anzacs. It was disbanded at the end of the war. The RN Brigade current size is around 3000 sailors and officers. There seems little likelihood that this will change in the near future.Recruitment  The RN Brigade recruits from civilians who elect to join the services, and also from serving sailors who transfer from other branches of the Senior Service. Service in the RN Brigade is on the same terms as enlistment in the other branches of the service. In common with the other services recruitment into the Royal Anglian Space Navy is open to NAC citizens.Training  Personnel choosing to join the RN Brigade are initial trained with other recruits at the various RN training depots. They then undertake the RN Brigade Course, lasting for some 16 weeks. The first 10 weeks are taken at the School of Infantry at Catterick, where they undergo the All Arms infantry Course. They then move on to the Security School at Faslane on the Clyde. There they are instructed in the arts of defending establishments from infiltration or attack by members of the Royal Marines. Those who then are selected for service in the light armoured Companies are sent to RAAF Honnington in Suffolk. There they are trained alongside members of the RAAF Regiment in the Field Squadron role. Watermanship training is stressed for those in other streams, especially the use of small boats both for boarding missions and patrolling the approaches to harbours. In addition some of the more experienced members of the Brigade are trained as divers, to help maintain the sub-surface security of port areas. Members of the RN Brigade, especially those in Hawke Company, have the opportunity to undertake Parachute and Commando training in the UK or other similar courses in the colonies. The RN Brigade rarely runs its own courses but has access to those run by all the services. The aim of the training is to produced well trained infantry soldiers with a specialisation in the defence of static targets. Or in the defence of forward deployed air squadrons. RN Brigade personnel serving with Naval Parties onboard RACSN warships are given extra training for this role.Operations  Operations in the RN Brigade normally fall into three categories. The first is with the Defence Companies in protection of RACSN Bases, the second with Light Armoured Companies in protecting Fleet Aerospace Arm squadrons operating planetside and the last is in providing manpower for Naval Parties Defence companies are roled to protect planetside assets of the Royal Anglian Confederation Space Navy including the Ministry of Defence Guard Force. RN Brigade units have responsibility for all other bases and in protecting the routine movements of high value ordnance within the NAC. In normal operations the RN Brigade will be responsible for providing an armed quick reaction force to back up civilian MoDGF personnel. However in times of tension RN Brigade presence will be stepped up and take the lead whilst RM Commando elements will be brought in to support the RN Brigade. Defence companies are trained to counter intrusion by a range of threats from civilian protesters to the media, guerrillas to special forces all the way to a full conventional attack. Defence companies can also be forward deployed should the RACSN need to seize operating bases and defence companies would be brought in to secure these facilities in conjunction with the assault troops. Hawke Company has been specifically trained for this role and has nearly all its personnel are commando trained. Generally however operations in defence companies are often quite dull (although sailors with families appreciate the stability of such a posting) and these units have been plagued with manpower retention problems. To make good this difficulty the RACSN has recently introduced a policy of cross posting to other branches of the Service. Additionally members of the defence companies are usually first in the queue to fill vacancies in Naval Parties. Additionally sailors in these units have plenty of access to RACSN facilities and many are key members of services sporting teams. The light armoured companies are generally found in the 3rd Battalion and with one company in the off-world 4th Battalion. These companies have the same general organisation and role as the RAAF Regiment Field Squadrons. Namely in the protection of forward deployed air squadrons operating close to enemy ground units. These units train and operate closely with the RAAF Regt especially since the advent of Joint Tactical Air Groups (JTAG) which see Fleet Aerospace Arm and Strike Command operating alongside each other. Light armoured units are primarily concerned with ground defence of the squadrons but also are involved in provision of short range air defence. These formations are equipped with light AFV's that are air portable by either conventional or tilt-rotor aircraft. The last role the RN Brigade is involved in is the provision of personnel for Naval Parties deployed on RACSN warships and RFA auxiliaries. Originally this was entirely a Royal Marine role but when that Corps became involved in colonial defence it felt unable to provide enough manpower to an expanding fleet and the RN Brigade took on the role. RN Brigade sailors with Naval Parties are routinely responsible for the defence of the ship in spaceport/orbit, weapons and fitness training for the crew and in providing boarding parties for blockade or patrol duties. (These units are not special forces and other units are tasked for counter-terrorism operations.) However boarding operations; during blockades, enforcing sanctions or upholding regulations are conducted with remarkable frequency. These can utilise the ship's aerospace assets or RN Brigade manned small ships. Naval parties are also sometimes called upon to operate planetside for a variety of reasons, from ceremonial, to humanitarian, to combat operations. It should be noted that RN Brigade personnel often provide back-up for the Shore Patrol in many ports and are quite used to having to subdue drunken matelots. Consequently the RN Brigade are not always well liked by other parts of the Senior Service. Lastly the RN Brigade's companies are capable as acting as conventional infantrymen. They have been called upon to do this on occasions, usually supplementing the army on peace support operations. As befits an organisation skilled in point defence they often guard key points and high value units. For instance Churchill Company served with the peacekeepers on Toldlheim, originally to protect the HQ area but later it undertook its own patrolling and hearts and minds programme. The Brigade consists of twelve independent companies (named for RN heroes), organised for administrative purposes into four battalions. Neither battalions or the Brigade itself is a fighting organisation with company being the standard operating unit. The whole Brigade is commanded by a Commodore, RN, whilst the battalions are led by a Commander, RN. 1st Battalion Benbow Company Hawke Company Collingwood Company 2nd Battalion Drake Company Nelson Company Cunningham Company 3rd Battalion Cochrane Company Lewis Company St. Vincent Company 4th Battalion Hood Company Fisher Company Churchill CompanyEquipment  The RN Brigade is equipped with standard NAC Army equipment and weaponry. They can be distinguished by their RN berets and 'RN Brigade' flash worn on the shoulder, the RN Bde patch is normally worn on the left arm and on the right side of the helmet. It is not uncommon for individual company insignia to be worn on the left shoulder. One quirk is the wearing of RN rank insignia on the left arm and equivalent army insignia on the right. This is supposedly due to the inability of other services to note the actual rank of RN Brigade personnel. At all times except for tactical exercises a white lanyard is worn around the left shoulder. Normal RN dress uniforms are worn when required. The naval cap is worn with a 'Royal Naval Brigade' tally. NAC MilitaryDBM De Bellis Multitudinis  De Bellis Multitudinis (DBM) is probably the most played set of rules for the hobby of ancient and medieval wargaming today, for the period 3000 BC to 1485 AD. DBM is at the more strategic end of the tabletop figure gaming genre, as its name implies (De Bellis Multitudinis = The Wars of the Many) it is aimed primarily at simulating large battles. The rules allow armies to be chosen from published Army Lists (in 4 books, with about 250 different army lists in total - but many more once all the in-list variants are taken into account) using a points system to select roughly equal armies if required. DBM was written by the UK based Wargames Research Group (WRG) team of Phil Barker, Richard Bodley Scott and Sue Laflin Barker. It evolved from the simpler DBA ruleset in the early 1990's. The DBx series now also includes Hordes of the Things or HOTT (a fantasy version), and DBR (a Renaissance version). DBM evolved from the earlier WRG 7th Edition Ancients ruleset, using its mechanism of fixed size elements as the basic fighting unit rather than individual figures, each element representing the smallest coherent fighting group possible. Any element in DBM covers the same frontage but at different formation densities. DBM also broke with ancients ruleset tradition by defining troop types by function - defining troops as bladesmen rather than Roman legionaries for example - allowing a higher level of abstraction to be used across 5,000 years of warfare. In addition it defines Superior, Ordinary and Inferior troops not just by training and morale but also by battlefield effectiveness. These approaches, coupled with a fairly simple game system, produces a fast playing but subtle game that is easy to pick up but much harder to master, and mirrors ancient warfare a lot more closely than most rulesets that have gone before. The armies are usually played in 15mm or 25mm scale, though 6mm and 54mm are used. Ground scale is in paces, and the number of inches to a pace varies according to the figure scale - 1\" to 50 paces in 15mm, 40mm to 50 paces in 25mm. The frontage width of the element base is standardised for all troop types, the depth and number of troop models on it varies by formation type (light infantry - or psiloi in DBM terminology - have 2 men per base, cavalry 3, heavy infantry 4 etc) Troop scale is not stated specifically, but as a the range of troops in an element ranges from 128 to 256, and the number of figures from 2 to 4, an assumed scale of c 1\u00a0: 60 is not way off the mark. Elephants, Chariots, Artillery and Shipping are 1 model per element, representing varying numbers of that type - for example 16 elephants or 25 chariots. Although the game is designed to be used between historical enemies the level of abstraction, standardised army lists, and points system allows players to pit 5,000 years worth of opponents against each other with fairly believable outcomes in the main. This ability to match wildly disparate armies has always been a major part of the allure of ancient and medieval wargaming to some players, much to the horror of those gamers who believe that only historical battles (or at least much smaller spans of history) can be accurately simulated. As well as friendly games, DBM competitions are played worldwide - including a truly global World championship. Competition games are typically played from 200 to 500 points, club games are typically 350 to 400 points. A 400 point army is typically an army of between about 50 and 80 elements, or about 150 - 250 figures in total (a high quality, mainly mounted army like a Mongol is more expensive per element, a mainly militia type such as Anglo Saxons at Hastings is cheaper per element and thus much larger).External links  The DBM community is global, a good starting point is author Richard Bodley Scott's webpage http://www.byzant.demon.co.uk/dbm.htmRH  RH - Romanov Hegemony In 2018 a new Czar was crowned in Russia. The CIS states remained allies through to the Chinese invasion of 2045. After the 2047 Communist revolution in Russia (sponsored by the Chinese), the Czarist government escaped to the Ukraine. The Ukraine, part of Russia and the remaining CIS states banded together to form the Romanov Hegemony to defend their interests against Chinese, and later Eurasion Union, aggression. The RH gained FTL space travel several years before the ESU, and began a program of colonization.", "Mercenaries Wiki": "Mercenaries Wiki Weapons and Vehicles  Below is a list of weapons and vehicles in the Mercenaries series.Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction Firearms Heavy Weapons Stationary Weapons Explosives Cheat Weapons  These weapons are only unlocked when you complete Mercenaries with all members of the Deck of 52 verified (does not matter if they are killed or jailed, they must all have Xs or jail bars).

It is developed by Pandemic Studios for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Windows, while Pi Studios is developing the PlayStation 2 version, with the publisher being Electronic Arts for all games. The game is set in Venezuela, with Jennifer Mui, Mattias Nilsson, and Christopher Jacobs returning.New features  Features new to Mercenaries 2 include even more destructible environments, co-operative mode, a fire effects engine that allows the player to ignite things such as oil or foliage, improved artificial intelligence for non-player characters and the ability to swim. The game is powered by the Havok 4.5 physics engine. New vehicles have been added, such as boats.Hijacking now consists of a small minigame, ranking in difficulty relative to the vehicle being hijacked. Another feature is the ability to switch from driver to gunner on demand. One other new addition to this iteration of Mercenaries is the ability to build a Private Military Company (PMC) and recruit mercenaries into it. There are three mercenaries that can be recruited: Eva Navarro, who will act as a mechanic once recruited, and Ewan Devlin, who is a helicopter pilot who can pick up valuable objects you may encounter, and can also extract the player if necessary. Also Misha Milanich, a bomber pilot, will be available for hire as the player's source for airstrikes. The game features terrain ranging from urban environments such as Caracas to the Amazon rainforest.Storyline  Main Article: The Betrayal The story follows the player's hunt for Ramon Solano, a druglord who contracted the player's mercenary for a job. Following a militaristic coup, Solano becomes the dictator of Venezuela. He uses his position to seize control of the country's oil supply, resulting in an international incident and distress among OPEC. Alongside Solano's Rebel Forces, a large portion of the Venezuelan army fiercely support the dictator's cause. The other rebel forces, in opposition to Solano, have risen under the name of the PLAV--the People's Liberation Army of Venezuela. Soon, numerous other factions join the fight for control of Venezuela's oil. Among them: The massive Universal Petroleum Corporation and its private military; the Rastafarian Pirates (the equivalent of the Russian Mafia), People's Liberation Army of Venezuela (PLAV), China's People's Liberation Army, and the Allied Nations. These five forces will inevitably form the backbone of a war to determine the fate of the country's oil supply. Betrayed, the player's mercenary will ally him/herself with any of the other factions to get even with Solano, and make some money along the way...Next-gen platform and PlayStation 2 discrepancies  While the PS3, Xbox 360, and PC versions are all the same, the PlayStation 2 version of the game is substantially different, with certain contracts not shared by both versions, the nature of missions being drastically changed, the order of missions being reshuffled, certain characters that exist in one version that don't appear in the other, as well as numerous gameplay features lacking in the PS2 version, to name but a few.Trophies and achievements  Mercenaries 2: World in Flames released with achievements on Xbox 360, sometime later the major 2.0 \"Payback\" update was released that introduced trophy support on PlayStation 3, among other things like worldwide co-operative mode and cheats. A list of the trophies and achievements for Mercenaries 2 can be found here.Cheats  Originally Mercenaries 2 did not feature any cheats, but after the major 2.0 \"Payback\" update cheats were released for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, a list of which can be found here. When using cheats in any game, achievement/trophies are disabled on that game save file.Controversy  The game has been criticized by the Venezuelan government, accusing the U.S. government and Pandemic Studios of trying to drum up support from the American public for a real-life invasion with the purpose of overthrowing Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. Pandemic Studios had previously developed training aids for the US Army.

They are mainly comprised of United States soldiers but also include soldiers from at least 12 other nations.\u00a0Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction  In Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction, the AN is headed by Colonel Samuel Garrett\u00a0and\u00a0Major Steven Howard. They used the US Embassy in North Korea near the Demilitarized Zone as their base of operations during the North Korean conflict, and then later a building near the city of Kusong up in the Northern Province. Unlike the other factions, they have no personal stakes or ambitions in the North Korean theatre: their only mission is to remove Song from power, dead or alive. Their soldiers wear a green/grey jungle/urban-style camouflage and blue helmets similar to the real life UN Peacekeepers. They can be considered the most technologically advanced faction in the game, with an arsenal of high-tier weapons and vehicles at their disposal. However, much to their great chagrin, diplomatic red-tape often prevents them from deploying their full military might in the hunt for Song. They mainly use humvees to get around and can frequently be seen patrolling around the DMZ and the roads near the areas around Kaesong in the Northern Province. They are rarely seen around any other areas; however, some units can be seen in Pyongyang, the Taechon Western Battlefield and of course at the MASH. Sometimes they are seen driving APCs near the DMZ and Blackhawk helicopters frequently fly overhead. In the Northern Province they are once again less widespread and are mostly found only around their headquarters and MASH. The majority of the AN contracts in Playground of Destruction include having to rescue someone, escort personnel or destroy immediate threats to their bases of operations.Soldier classes  They are friendly with all sides in the conflict except the Russian Mafia (however, they will not open fire on each other) and the KPA. Garrett has contact with both the South Korean leader, Mitchell Buford, and either Sergei Voronov or (more likely) Josef Yurinov, but the AN and the Chinese never interact. In terms of the Russian Mafia, they are averse to the idea of organized crime but do not take any action against them.Mercenaries 2: World in Flames  The Allies reappear in Mercenaries 2: World in Flames with distinctly less than honorable intentions. After the realization of the fact that Universal Petroleum could not keep a constant flow of oil with the destruction of the Venezuelan oil rig, the Allied Nations (mostly the US) mobilized their forces, ostensibly to \"Protect the people and the democracy of Venezuela\" although it is merely (and obviously) a front to justify their invasion of the country so as to secure their oil (a concept based on the United States' alleged motivation behind the 2003 Iraq invasion). However, after having a dispute with China over where the oil goes, a conflict breaks out in which the player aids one of the factions to capture Caracas, whilst terminating or capturing the other side's leader. In the case of the Allies, their leader is Agent Phillip Joyce. After being properly introduced (after 1 outpost capture), the Allied Nations will reward $50k for every PLA soldier kills or assets destroyed. Unlike the Chinese, when Solano nukes the Allied HQ he uses a Neutron Bomb, not a normal Fusion Bomb, presumably to mitigate infrastructural damage on Caracas. The Allies are only friendly towards UP and the Mercenary (if they are on good terms), they are hostile to everyone else. However, Agent Joyce still supports the destruction of the UP headquarters since it gives the AN the opportunity to claim Venezuela's oil directly. Agent Joyce attempts to double-cross the mercenary after the latter succeeded in verifying Zhou Peng, claiming the usual problem of red-tape, until the Allied HQ comes under attack and is destroyed in Solano's nuclear attack, Agent Joyce in desperation gives the Nuclear Bunker Buster to the mercenary along with the hasty order to hunt down Solano once and for all. This is in contrast to Peng, who offers it with his blessings and wishes the mercenary luck in their hunt for revenge. Either way, the Allies don't get the oil after all as they are forced to withdraw from the country either from the destruction of their headquarters or the Chinese victory.Soldier classes  Note: The Allies offer you the Barrett .50 caliber anti-material sniper rifle in their outpost buildings, yet they don't use or have \"sniper units.\"Known Members Named Characters Unnamed Characters Arsenal Playground of Destruction Infantry Weapons Aircraft Ground Vehicles World in Flames Infantry weapons Aircraft Ground vehicles Naval vessels Diplomacy Playground of Destruction  Allies: South Korea, China Enemies: Russian Mafia, North KoreaWorld in Flames  Allies: Universal Petroleum Enemies: People's Liberation Army of Venezuela, China, Rastafarian Pirates, VenezuelaReal life  The idea of the Allied Nations is almost certainly based on the United Nations, a global peace keeping organization that promotes international peace and security. Unlike the AN however, the UN does not have a military of its own and it should also be clearly noted that the Allied Nations are definitely not the United Nations. Presently, in the United Nations any action or proposal to act would have to be voted yes by 9 UN Security Council members out of 15 and all of 5 permanent members (USA, Russia, China, Britain, France) must approve or abstain (a single 'no' vote by a permanent member means 'no' to whatever is being voted on). As a permanent member since 1971, China has the power to veto/stop any UN action if it wanted to, so the United States (or anyone else) theoretically would not be allowed to act against the interests of China or any permanent member under the name of the United Nations.Trivia See also Mattias Nilsson  Mattias Nilsson is an ex-ExOps operative and former member of Sweden's Elite Arctic Rangers and The Swedish Navy. He is also well known for his almost fetishistic use of high explosives.History  Mattias has served in conflicts around the world. The so far known ones are Kosovo where he worked alongside Josef, North Korea, Montenegro, East Timor, Senegal alongside fellow mercenary Blanco and most recently Venezuela.Personality  Mattias can be summarized as a \"wild man.\" Rowdy, boisterous and an adrenaline junkie he finds his work as a mercenary allows him to operate independently of those who may disapprove of his actions, his employers typically only concerned with results. It is, at its core, his way of being paid for doing what he loves. Though volatile, he is not sadistic or psychotic. He does not take pleasure from the deadly results of his destructive impulses, though he is not unaware of them either, accepting their inevitability. He is also possessed of a dry, sarcastic wit, delivering his lines with a deadpan tone. The characteristic that has given him the most fame is his frequent use of high-grade explosives for even the smallest problems and his tendency to not only defeat, but utterly destroy his enemies. Even those familiar with his reputation are shocked by his penchant for explosive violence. He does however have a 'soft' side; loyal to those he considers friends and willing to stand up to a threat to defend them. He also has a soft side for the little guy, just trying to get by. He cares little about who employs him or why, only that it allows him to exercise his love of explosives and destruction. A phrase used many times by Mattias is \"Why can't EVERYTHING be rocket propelled?\" According to the Mercenaries 2: World in Flames website, Mattias' favorite form of music is Swedish death metal, a genre that is characteristic of his own aggressive, violent and rebellious nature. Some of Mattias' favorite songs are: A recurring joke throughout the series is Mattias knowing nothing about babysitting. In Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction during the AN contract where you need to drive a GSRN reporter to various sites, Fiona asks Mattias \"Up for a little babysitting?\" to which Mattias obliviously replies \"What the hell is babysitting?\". Also in Mercenaries 2: World in Flames during the UP contract that involves transporting an executive Fiona again refers to baby-sitting, this time Mattias confusingly responding with \"Why would anyone sit on a baby?\"Skills  Mattias' time in the Arctic Rangers has made him extremely athletic, capable of running, sprinting, and swimming for long distances. He is also physically strong and coordinated, able to knock out or even kill enemy combatants with one bash from whatever weapon he's holding. His time in the Swedish biker gang has made him an expert in driving motorcycles, and his criminal career has trained him in carjacking and evasive driving. His stint in various Private Military Companies has given him experience with nearly all modern small arms and military craft, including helicopters, gunships, maritime assault craft, and tanks. He is also very adept at using air strikes, including beacon, radio homing, and satellite coordinated munitions. He is fluent in Russian, Swedish and English.Playground of Destruction World in Flames Trivia Related Pages Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction  Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction is a third-person shooter which takes place in the near future. It was developed by Pandemic Studios and published on January 11, 2005, by LucasArts. It is available for the Sony PlayStation 2 and the Microsoft Xbox. The sequel, Mercenaries 2: World in Flames, was released on the 31st of August 2008 for North America and the 5th of September the same year for Europe on Windows, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.Plot  Main article: Song Initiative In 2009, the president of North Korea, Choi Kim, extends an olive branch to South Korea. The hopes he has of a peaceful Korea reunification spread to South Korea and the South Koreans agree to send North Korea money on the condition that they disband their military. North Korea agrees. All is well until the night of the reunification. President Choi Kim's son, General Choi Song, is dissatisfied with the peace treaties and talks. On the eve of the reunification of North and South Korea, he stages a violent coup, storming the summit and killing his father, seizing control of the country. General Choi Song then expels all foreigners from North Korea into South Korea. North Korea goes \"dark.\" No weapon inspectors or foreign press are allowed in and all communications with the outside world cease. Eventually, the world's eyes turn to other matters. Still rumors run rampant, all hinting the worst, but, as many hoped, they are just rumors. A North Korean freighter, found floundering in a storm, is rescued by the Royal Australian Navy. The RAN finds the crew making a hasty attempt to scuttle the ship, and becomes suspicious. Upon searching the ship, the RAN finds nuclear weapons bound for an Indonesian company known to be a front for terrorists. The link between Song, terrorists, and nuclear weapons is made. Within hours of the discovery, Chinese intelligence reports that Song's missile capabilities are much higher than once assumed \u2013 he can hit any target on all seven continents. The Allied Nations forms a combat force with troops from all over the globe, initiates a large-scale landing, and smashes through a division of NK regulars, taking the missile sites at Yongbyon. The NK troops, though well-trained and equipped, had never experienced real war - resulting in many of its commanders panicking and fleeing. The Allied Nations emerge victorious with minimal losses. But their euphoria over breaking Song's grip on the country is cut short - they find documents containing evidence that Song is building 30 more nuclear warheads and missiles at an unknown launch site. Worse yet, the documents indicate that the weapons will be ready in three weeks. The AN top priority becomes to find and capture or kill Song before he is able to launch the missiles. After two weeks of searching fruitlessly for Song, the AN issues a \"Deck of 52.\" The Clubs are members of Division 39, a state-sponsored mafia consisting of ministers in the government. The Diamonds are high-ranking military officials. The Hearts are noted scientists credited with developing nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. The Spades are General Song's all-female special forces squad and their male commanders. Song, of course, is the Ace of Spades. A $100 million USD bounty is placed on his head, with the bounties on the other members of the Deck of 52 beginning at $25,000 for the number cards of the Clubs. The player is a mercenary working for Executive Operations, or ExOps, a private military company that provides military services to world governments and large corporations. The player has been tasked with finding and either capturing or killing members of the Deck of 52, and most specifically, General Song, before he can launch his nuclear warheads. There are multiple endings to the game depending on whether the player disabled the nuclear missiles or not and the faction with the most trust at the end of the game. All endings are with either the ICBMs exploding after receiving the self-destruct codes or the ICBMs hitting downtown Seoul, Tokyo, Moscow or Beijing and causing millions of casualties and the capture or death of General Song.Factions  Immediately after Song's coup, the Allied Nations invade North Korea in an attempt to stop the launch of several nuclear missiles intended for cities such as Tokyo and Seoul. Other factions soon arrive in the area all with their own goals and ambitions. This creates a five way tug-of-war resulting in numerous conflicts and battles between forces.North Korea  The main antagonists of the game. The North Korean army is always hostile towards the player during the course of the game, and will attack the player on sight. Led by the ruthless General Choi Song, he and his army want dominance over most of Asia, and will stop at nothing to ensure victory. When the Allied Nations invaded North Korea, Song's men split up and created various outposts and bases around the landscape. When exploring the map, the player will encounter North Koreans in numerous places. They are the most abundant army in the game. The North Koreans have access to some very powerful vehicles-APCs, heavy tanks, and helicopter gunships-but can be considered the least technologically-advanced faction. The North Korean army is divided into certain ranks. The common soldier wears a brown uniform and usually carries an AK-47 or an RPG-7 (Rocket Propelled Grenade). The player will fight them the most while playing the game. The next level of the NK army is the Elite Forces unit. They are seen with black outfits and use light machine guns and the occasional anti-tank or anti-air rocket launcher. These elite soldiers are more intelligent, but are only dealt with later on in the game (during the Northern Province stage and Aces missions). Next is the Officers, who usually carry SMGs and drop money, ammo, or grenades when captured or killed. Like all officers, they can see through disguises, and killing one in front of a member of another faction causes a boost in that faction's favor equivalent to killing two enlisteds. The highest rank is the Deck of 52. Although not recognized by that title in their own army, the AN explains it is a way of identifying High Value Targets. The \"members\" of the deck are in the form of officers, senior governmental officials, military leaders, scientists, black ops commandos, and elite military commanders. View the Deck of 52 below for more detailed information on the Deck of 52.Allied Nations  A replacement for the United Nations and Coalition of the willing, this global army is lead by Col. Samuel Garrett. The Allied Nations are in North Korea for one reason only: to stop General Song at all costs. They have collected a number of the \"most wanted\", and have named this group the \"Deck of 52\". It lists 52 High Value Targets, and are important in some way to General Song. After the capture or death of Song and his men, the AN wishes to bring humanitarian aid to the people of North Korea. Col. Garrett finds himself having to rely on the power of the mercenary to take out vital lifelines in Song's army. The AN have a formidable army, which include APCs, powerful tanks, helicopter gunships, and humvees. The soldiers, who wear camouflage uniforms and blue helmets, normally carry M4 carbines, and are generally much tougher than the average soldier. In addition, GSRN (Global Satellite Reporting Network) field reporters have been embedded with the Allied Nations. Their presence has made the AN's job rather more difficult, as the increased media attention in the North Korean battle zones means that the more covert and underhanded measures applied by the Allied forces are no longer going unnoticed.South Korea  While the regular South Korean Army is part of the Allied Nations forces, a separate detachment named South Korean Union (SKU) was a covert operation group funded, fostered and backed by the CIA in the person of Special Agent Mitchell Buford. These SK soldiers take their orders from Langley, VA. The South Koreans are after the reunification of Korea, and have moved aggressively to establish a strategic foothold. Needless to say, they are not happy about China's designs on their northern neighbors. The South Koreans control technology much like the Allied Nations, and provide access to stealth fighter and bomber support (courtesy of the CIA). Agent Buford typically tasks the player with rescue/recovery missions or crippling infrastructure attacks that he does not want traced back to the South Koreans, though by the third \"act\" the SK and Chinese forces are engaged in open warfare. SK jobs can vary, but most pit the player against the North Koreans, the Chinese, and occasionally, the Russian Mafia. Most SKU soldiers are equipped with the same basic weaponry as their AN counterparts, such as the Carbine, grenades and AT/AA rockets. But their vehicle camouflage tends more towards a wintry white/grey/Blue pattern than the blue/green jungle/grassland color scheme of the AN machines, while their soldiers wear fatigues with entirely different color schemes (closely resembling the uniform worn by South Korean military police in the Joint Security Area of the DMZ). A few SKU Soldiers carry the MG36, which is also used by some of the all-female commandos of the ROKA 707th Special Mission Battalion. SK snipers carry Dragunov sniper weapons, while some officers and 707th commandos carry silenced sub-machine guns. Some SKU troops have also employed RPGs and other anti-tank weapons. The SK motorized and mechanized forces feature TOW-armed variants of the Allied humvees and have been painted a blue camoflauge, APCs and powerful attack helicopters. However, since it is a covert unit, the SK forces lack heavy armored support. Speed and mobility are the South Korean forces' primary assets, as they do not have the heavy armor or manpower to engage in sustained combat with Chinese or North Korean forces. Collecting WMD blueprints (small blue-grey metal boxes with nuclear symbols on them) and/or destroying NK monuments (usually giant statues of General Song) will increase South Korean favor toward the player. Killing NK, Mafia, or Chinese troops in the presence of SK troops will raise favor for the player as well. It is worth noting that, while the South Korean forces are referred to as the SKU in the instruction manual, this title, or the notion that the SK operation is a covert one, is mentioned nowhere else in the game. Viewing a soldier through the binoculars brings up the acronym ROKA; Republic of Korea Army.China  The People's Liberation Army, commanded by Col. Zhou Peng, would like to set up a pro-China regime in North Korea and make the country a province of the PRC. This naturally puts them at odds with both Korean nations--South and North. The Chinese have access to a massive array of firepower, much of which is placed at the player's disposal when on Chinese missions. Col. Peng repeatedly sends the player on missions that his forces are too slow or unable to complete with sufficient precision, such as assassinations and other covert operations. When working for the Chinese, jobs will often involve work against SK or NK forces. Although officially part of the Allied coalition, the Chinese forces operate independently and do not follow the standard AN equipment patterns - they wear winter/urban camouflage gear and use Type-56 assault rifles, RPG-7s, and RPD machine guns extensively. PLA Officers carry Type 85 Sub-Machine Guns and some PLA Soldiers carry heavier weapons, such as Anti-Tank and Anti-Air missiles. Being the largest single military force in the world, the PLA has access to some exceptionally powerful vehicles - these include a wide range of heavily-armed APC and tank variants and heavy-lift helicopters. The PLA also features vast artillery coverage and supplies the Fuel Air Bomb air strike which is excellent at destroying many things close togetehr. Destroying SK listening posts (poles with an antenna dish and blinking red light on top) and/or recovering Korean national treasures (crates with a crest spraypainted on the side) will increase Chinese favor toward the player. Also, killing SK, NK, or Mafia soldiers in sight of Chinese troops will increase Chinese favor.Russian Mafia  Though undoubtedly powerful, the Russian Mafia is first and foremost a criminal organization and therefore has no major military presence in North Korea. However, its well-armed thugs and customized vehicles patrol the streets of many North Korean cities, including the capital, Pyongyang. Most Mafia Thugs carry Type 85 SMGs and most Capos (The Mafia equivalent of officers) carry Shotguns. The Mafia enforcers are equipped with RPD light machine guns, AK-47 assault rifles, and RPGs. But the Mafia still have the lightest ground presence out of all the factions, with few men and no tanks or APCs, and very few helicopters. The Northern Province, however, has a vast presence of Mafia technicals and SUVs, presumably since at this point, there is no Allied or NK navy blockade to stop their import. Any land vehicle can be sold to the Mafia's chop shop. High-end vehicles (such as tanks) are naturally worth the most money. The less damaged the vehicle, the greater the pay for them. This is the only way outside of missions and killing NK, SK, or Chinese soldiers to raise the player's standing with the Mafia. The Russian Mafia also run an online black market shop called the Merchant of Menace shop, which can be accessed via your PDA. This shop allows you to purchase vehicles and supply drops, as well as air strikes unlocked throughout the game.Weapons Characters Playable characters  The three playable characters are Christopher Jacobs, Jennifer Mui, and Mattias Nilsson. The three initially playable characters in Mercenaries are sufficiently distinct to make the game somewhat re-playable. Each has a particular strength which will alter the player\u2019s strategy somewhat, as well as a unique language proficiency which will render side conversations from a particular faction understandable. For instance Jacobs, who can understand Korean , is able to understand the South Koreans; Mattias knows Russian, which the Russian Mafia speak; and Jennifer, being born in Hong Kong, and thus fluent with Chinese, can understand the Chinese army. And since all of them know English, they have no problem understanding the AN who always speak english. Like many console games, Mercenaries contains unlockable perks as rewards for completing certain in-game tasks. Among these are secret characters/skins. For instance, picking up a certain number of National Treasures will allow access to playing with an NK Elite skin. However, this effect is only cosmetic and will have no effect on gameplay or the main character's attributes. This being a LucasArts game, it is also possible to unlock both Indiana Jones and Han Solo as playable characters. It should be noted that each character has a campaign that varies slightly in difficulty from the others. Jacobs can be described as having the easy campaign, Jennifer having a normal difficulty, and Mattias having the hardest. The difference is shown in such few places though that most gamers hardly know the difference.Non-playable characters  Major non-playable characters include General Choi Song, President Choi Kim, Dung Hwangbo, General Chin Chang, General Chul Kang, Fiona Taylor, Adriana Livingston, Colonel Samuel Garrett, Major Steven Howard, Agent Mitchell Buford, Major Park, Colonel Zhou Peng, Captain Kai Leu, Sergei Voronov, Josef Yurinov and Misha. Although some characters are skins that you can use, they are not playable.Influences  The player is deposited in a vast \"sandbox-type\" environment, and set loose to pick up missions, perform side tasks, collect items, or just shoot stuff, all at the player's whim. To advance the story, one must perform certain missions, but the game doesn't lead the player around by the hand to do so. In fact, one can level all of the buildings in the playing environment, including the faction HQs. After an extended time away from the area of a faction HQ the HQ and it's guard (a doorman the player must interact with to enter the HQ) are restored. Also, if the player dies or calls a medevac, then the HQs will be restored. In order to get back in the favor of an offended faction the mercenary must bribe the HQ guard. The concept of the \"Deck of 52\" is borrowed from the method used by Coalition forces in Iraq to identify wanted members of Saddam Hussein's deposed government. Executive Operations, the name of the fictional company the protagonist works for, is most likely a reference to Executive Outcomes, a private military company that ceased to exist in 1999.Cheats  Main Article: Mercs CheatsSoundtrack  The soundtrack for Mercenaries was composed by Michael Giacchino and Chris Tilton and has a very heavy, epic orchestral theme to it. There are also many more subtle and peaceful musical tracks for when the merc is roaming the countryside, to very intense and loud music during fight scenes.Controversy  Mercenaries was banned from shelves in South Korea for depicting war in its still-hostile theater, as was Ghost Recon 2. The delicate situation between North and South Korea means that the government is under severe pressure to ban media that depicts war between the two nations, for fear that it could further strain an already tense diplomatic situation.Trivia Critical reception  The game received generally favorable reviews from critics. As of January 31, 2008, on the review aggregator Game Rankings, the Xbox version of the game had an average score of 86% based on 68 reviews. On Metacritic, it had an average score of 86 out of 100, based on 65 reviews. As of January 31, 2008, on the review aggregator Game Rankings, the PS2 version of game had an average score of 84% based on 42 reviews. On Metacritic, it has an average score of 84 out of 100, based on 44 reviews. Ryan Davis of GameSpot gave the game a rating of 8.8 out of 10, saying the action is greatly varied and \"fundamentally satisfying\", the world is immersive, and the game has \"gorgeous carnage.\" Davis also said the exaggerated physics in the game is sometimes too much and the quality of the sound effects is uneven. Davis said the game is \"a much better game overall\" than Full Spectrum Warrior, a game that Pandemic Studios previously developed. Davis said that at first the game looks like a Grand Theft Auto knockoff due to similar elements such as a third-person perspective, the ability to get in any vehicle you see and \"an irrepressible enthusiasm for explosive chaos\", but that Mercenaries is more linear and mission-based. Davis said \"most of the ground-based vehicles feel a little too floaty.\" Davis wrote \"It's amazing how close the game scrapes to reality without actually breaking through, and its use of a slightly fictionalized North Korea as a setting can be a little unsettling at times. But despite the game's commitment to a quasirealistic scenario, the action is fast and loose.\" Davis noted the voiceover performances of Peter Stormare and Carl Weathers as particularly well done.Awards Vehicles  This category will list all of the vehicle pages. A vehicle is any powered piece of machinery that allows for movement and/or war-fighting. This includes motorcycles, cars, boats, tanks, helicopters and planes.Universal Petroleum  Universal Petroleum or just UP, is a large Texas-based petrochemical corporation.Mercenaries 2: World in Flames  Before the beginning of the game, UP had already been extracting Venezuela's oil supply when your character is introduced in Mercenaries 2: World in Flames. They are well-established in-country and do not take well to any efforts to cut in on or put an end to their oil profits. When Solano comes to power, Universal Petroleum is forced to defend their oil fields and assets from both Solano's \"nationalization\" and the Guerillas' campaign to cast them out of the country. Both faction's goals threaten to be extremely costly for Universal Petroleum if they get anywhere, and UP executives would rather spend lavish amounts of money defending their assets in Venezuela and returning the situation to the previous status quo than see either Ramon Solano or the Guerillas' campaigns succeed. Furthermore, the chaos caused by Solano's seizure of power and the fighting for control of the country between multiple groups has created a perfect environment for piracy; Universal Petroleum is a very obviously wealthy company, and a natural target for organized criminals seeking a profit. For these reasons, UP has hired the services of mercenaries from Tactical Solutions Inc. UP is headed by Dr. Lorraine Rubin, who has one goal in Venezuela: \"Keep the oil flowing\". Universal Petroleum controls most of the tankers and oil rigs on Lake Maracaibo, and Tactical Solutions soldiers patrol the areas around them with extreme vigilance. They are also seen patrolling the UP refinery but seem to be fighting a tug-of-war with the VZ forces nearby. Their boats can be seen around the northern area of the map, on the sea that separates the mainland with the islands controlled by the Balseros Crew, it's common to see UP and Pirates fighting there. Being an American-based oil company, Universal Petroleum is antagonistic to Solano's desire to nationalize Venezuela's oil reserves. They already employ a small army of mercenaries to defend their assets in Venezuela, and thus have no problem whatsoever bringing on one more mercenary to do work on their behalf. When the conflict in Venezuela escalates and the Allied Nations and the People's Republic of China arrive, Universal Petroleum receives aid and protection from the AN while the PRC sides with the pro-communist Guerrillas. Universal Petroleum succeeds in its aims in Venezuela if the player sides with them and then the AN, or fails if the player sides with the Guerrillas and the Chinese.The UP Headquarters  UP's HQ is easily one of the tallest buildings in Venezuela. This jet-black monolith can be seen as far away as the Pirate HQ. Prior to the invasion of Venezuela by the AN and the Chinese, Dr. Lorraine Rubin can be found here to offer 2 contracts. The HQ is surrounded by guard towers with troops, several Raven SUV assault units, and rocket infantry. If the player sides with the Chinese, one of their missions involve destroying UP's headquarters. Doing this will immediately destroy the player's positive relationship with UP (can be bribed or kill PLAV troops until they are friendly). To deter such an attack, AN troops, tanks, APCs, AN rocket troops, and helicopters patrol Maracaibo alongside the full bulk of Tactical Solutions Incorporated's arsenal.Oil Rights  According to Fiona, Universal Petroleum tricked the pre-Solano government into giving them exclusive access to their oil, and returning a \"ridiculously small cut\" as reimbursement. During a mission where the player must help protect David Espinoza as he burns some documents, it's revealed that they were evidence that proved UP's scam against the Venezuelans. David states that they were able to make the Venezuelans pay the UP for their own oil which the UP was drilling for. Small oil rigs can be found all over Venezuela. There can also be some solitary drilling platforms can be found around the outskirts of the UP refinery.Members Tactical Solutions Incorporated  Main Article: Tactical Solutions Incorporated Tactical Solutions Incorporated is a Texas-based mercenary company hired by UP to protect their operations and assets in Venezuela. Which can seem fairly obvious from the southern drawl in their voices, yet since they're NPCs they don't have a great deal of lines.Soldier Classes Vehicles Ground Vehicles Helicopters  Rogue Transport Rogue Assassin Anti-Tank RogueWatercraft  UP Inflatable Warhorse Patrol BoatInfantry Weapons Diplomacy  Allies: Allied Nations Enemies: Rastafarian Pirates, People's Liberation Army of Venezuela, China, VenezuelaTrivia Mercenaries 2  This category is to organize everything that is in the game Mercenaries 2: World in Flames.People's Liberation Army  The People's Liberation Army is the collective armed forces of the People's Republic of China and have appeared in both Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction and Mercenaries 2: World in Flames.Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction  The People's Liberation Army is one of five factions in Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction. The PLA, commanded by Colonel Zhou Peng, has been ordered by China's leadership to invade North Korea, with the objective being to defeat the Korean People's Army and set up a pro-Chinese regime in North Korea. Ultimately, North Korea is to be annexed into the People's Republic of China. This naturally puts the PLA at odds with both Korean nations-South and North. The People's Liberation Army is massive and has access to a staggering array of firepower; no other nation besides North Korea deploys as many main battle tanks in the game or can rival the PLA's number of soldiers. The PLA has deployed a great deal of field and air-defense artillery to support its frontline infantry and armored forces, and extend this considerable long-range firepower to the mercenary for a price. However, if the mercenary is on a contract from the Chinese, a number of calls for artillery fire and logistics support are frequently offered, and if they are, there is no fee. \"China is a vast and powerful nation,\" Colonel Peng says, early in the game when he is first meeting the mercenary sent by Executive Operations. The upside of this is that the PLA is a massive force that both Koreas have great difficulty opposing; the downside is that \"the People's Army is large and slow to rouse\", meaning it can take time- sometimes more than is acceptable- for the PLA to mobilize forces and respond to a threat or problem. High-precision actions taken on short notice are not what the PLA forces sent to North Korea are best equipped to handle. Realizing that the mercenary is an effective counter to this weakness of his country's army, Colonel Peng frequently sends the player on assassination, VIP extraction, and other missions requiring a highly competent operative and a more delicate touch than the PLA can usually do. Given that China is extremely unfriendly to the North Koreans and South Koreans alike- both Koreas have goals in the conflict that are at odds with China's- working for the Chinese often involves going up against NK or SK forces. Offered contracts will occasionally send the mercenary against the Russian Mafia as well, but unlike the two Koreas, whom Colonel Peng takes seriously, the PLA holds the Russian mob in contempt and sees them as an annoyance, scavengers to be crushed in a war being fought by proper soldiers.  Although officially part of the Allied coalition, the Chinese forces operate independently and do not follow the standard AN equipment patterns - they wear winter/urban camouflage gear and use Type 56 assault rifles, Type 69 RPGs, and RPD machine guns extensively. PLA Officers carry Type-85 SMGs and some PLA Soldiers carry heavier weapons, such as Anti-Tank and Anti-Air missiles. Some specialized soldiers will also carry Sniper Rifles. Being the largest single military force in the world, the PLA has access to some exceptionally powerful vehicles - these include a wide range of heavily-armed APCs, and more main battle tanks than any other faction in the game. Chinese forces possess more mechanized ground forces than any other faction in the game, rivaled only by the Korean People's Army- going to war with the PLA is not a very attractive idea. In addition to its enormous firepower in field artillery, the PLA supplies the Fuel Air Bomb air strike. The army, however, does not have much in the way of airpower, only having one helicopter gunship: the WZ-9 transport/light support helicopter. In this area, the North Koreans and Allied Nations are both stronger, possessing greater numbers of better-armed helicopters. The Chinese goal of annexing North Korea puts them in an increasingly-antagonistic position with the South Koreans. There is a tense truce in the Southern Province during the first half of the game, but even then the Chinese and South Koreans are both willing to use the mercenary to take shots at each other. By the time the second half of the game sees the fighting move to the Northern Province, the diplomatic situation between the PRC and the ROK has worsened, and before the game ends hostilities escalate into all-out war. The People's Liberation Army is engaged in bitter fighting with the Republic of Korea Army by the game's end, fighting at a considerable advantage with greater numbers and more armored vehicles.Mercenaries 2: World in Flames  The People's Liberation Army make a return in Mercenaries 2: World in Flames with the intent to install a pro-Chinese government in Venezuela and protect Chinese interests. They originally funded and used the People's Liberation Army of Venezuela as a proxy. However, it became clear that their leader, Marcela Acosta, was unable (or unwilling) to overthrow Solano's government. At the same time, the United States under the name of the Allied Nations intend on taking the oil for themselves. The PLA, under the command of the newly promoted General Peng, are under orders to seize control of the country and oil reserves. In Mercenaries 2, their HQ is the Castle of Saint Anthony and they control most of Cumana. The PLA has arguably a smaller but denser and stronger armored presence than the Allied Nations, this can be noticed by trying to force one's way through Chinese territory in comparison to doing to same against the Allied Nations. The PLA has an abundance of constantly mobile Tempered Hammer Artillery self propelled artillery, Salamander APCs and Leaping Fox GLs  constantly patrolling their HQ vicinity, They provide a very effective buffer for any gound attack. The main PLA base and PLA HQ are heavily defended with Iron Dove Heavy AAs\u00a0making a succesful hostile air approach very hard. The PLA also has many Bladesong Missile Boats  patroling on the Eastern side of Venezuela (anywhere East of Caracas). It seems that the PLA have taken control of Isla de Margarita, they have a surprisingly strong position on the island and are using its dock for their Dynasty Class Missile Destroyer. It is not revealed why the PLA have taken over the Island other than it is a staging ground for operations on the mainland.Known members Named characters Unnamed characters Arsenal Playground of Destruction Infantry weapons Aircraft Ground vehicles World in Flames Infantry weapons Aircraft Ground vehicles Naval vessels Diplomacy Playground of Destruction  Allies: Allied Nations, South Korea (During the first half of the game) Enemies: North Korea, Russian Mafia, South Korea (During the second half of the game)World in Flames  Allies: People's Liberation Army of Venezuela Enemies: Allied Nations,\u00a0Pirates, Universal Petroleum, VenezuelaTrivia See also Jennifer Mui  Jennifer Mui was a member of ExOps and was their most experienced agent. She is also a former member of the Secret Intelligence Service, also known as MI6, Britain's international intelligence agency. She is currently part of the Private Military Company. Mui is featured in both Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction and Mercenaries 2: World in Flames as a playable character.History  Mui was born in Hong Kong, China to a British cultural attach\u00e9 and a Chinese diplomat. Her parents divorced when she was twelve years old. Mui moved to Britain with her mother and her father remained in Hong Kong. Being the daughter of a single parent who was often busy at work made Jen extremely self-reliant. She was an exceptional student and athlete and after graduating, she joined her Majesty's Armed Forces, more specifically, she was a part of the Paratroopers. Then she moved on to the Special Air Service. It was during this time that an MI6 recruiter took an interest in her. Although Jennifer enjoyed her work and was supremely qualified for it, she was dissatisfied with the income she earned. She left MI6 and became a mercenary, where her espionage experience put her in high demand. She joined Executive Operations, serving them for seven years and participating in the \"Song Initiative.\"Personality  Jen has learned to be self-reliant and fiercely independent, perceiving reliance on others to be a weakness and trusting only a select few mercenary comrades. This is a product of a lack of strong parental influence in her life. Her parents separated and her mother frequently away on business-related matters leaving her to rely on herself. She is also what some may call \"greedy\", with an obsession for material wealth, stemming from a desire to lead a life better than that of her mother after her parent's divorce. She never questions the morality of her work, only the income, believing that everyone is dirty but their money is clean. She enjoys her work as a mercenary, finding it allows her to remain independent of others and provides the income to support the lifestyle she desires. She is also a shrewd negotiator, frequently manipulating new clients who underestimate her beauty and womanly charms.Quotes  Mercenaries 1: Mercenaries 2:Skills  Jennifer's years of service under MI6 and the training required have made her supremely skilled in stealthy operations. While Chris approaches missions with conventional military tactics and Mattias destroys everything in his wake with massive firepower, Jennifer prefers to remain as quiet and covert as possible. She is an expert marksman, skilled with a sniper rifle as well as other covert weapons. She is also skilled at throwing grenades, capable of throwing them further than her comrades. However, she often wears less body armor or protective clothing than Mattias or Chris, and so she is less durable in combat than either. Because of her slimmer frame and less muscle mass, she carries less ammunition than the other mercenaries, but is able to sprint faster and for longer distances. Due to her years in Hong Kong, Jennifer is a fluent speaker of the Chinese language.Trivia Related Pages Chris Jacobs  Chris Jacobs was a member of ExOps and a former member of the Combat Applications Group, better known as Delta Force. Chris is currently part of the Private Military Company and has been featured in both Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction and Mercenaries 2: World in Flames.History  Chris Jacobs is the son of a South Korean diplomat and a U.S Army Colonel, with a long line of ancestors serving in the nation's military. Following their footsteps, he pushed to succeed, and applied to and was quickly accepted into Delta Force, the United States' premiere counter-terrorist agency. He was an accomplished operative, soon rising to position as a unit commander. Caring deeply for them, he led them through perilous operations in Iraq, Darfur and Afghanistan. During these conflicts, he saw that the ideals of men like his father were impossible to uphold. He witnessed his commanders sabotage missions for personal gain, intentionally compromise operatives and allowed for horrible atrocities to be committed. This culminated with a joint-operations mission with the SAS, which resulted in the deaths of five of his men. Embittered, he did not re-enlist when his tour was up. In spite of this, Jacobs realized he could never \"give up the battlefield,\" and with years of military experience and few skill sets for any other occupation, he became a mercenary, working for the Private Military Company Executive Operations, where he served a tour during the \"Song Initiative.\"Personality  Jacobs is a bitter, cynical and amoral individual. Chris sees only three kinds of people: the ignorant masses, their corrupt leaders and enterprising individuals who manipulate and exploit both. He laughs at the notion that this can change and at the people ignorant enough to believe this and he has no expectations that this view will change anytime in the future, however, he nevertheless maintains a pleasant and likeable disposition to others, and his idealistic self-had not completely died. As a Mercenary, Chris not only had a well-paying job which allowed him to travel across the world, but left him free to wage his own personal war against \"the bad guys,\" in other words, individuals whom he believes stands against everything he once fought for, and without the restraints of red tape, moral backlash or corrupt seniors to hold him back, he finds a small measure of comfort in his new career. While these traits would make him a liability in a regular army, it makes him a perfect mercenary and solo-operative. After the North Korean operation, he took to smoking cigars and often has one clenched between his teeth. He never seems to become attached to anyone leaving a question of loyalty.Skills  Jacobs's Delta Force training gives him a keen insight regarding battle, mostly fighting using conventional army tactics; he is highly adaptable to any combat situation and thinks on his feet. In the first game, Jacobs wears custom-made body armor that made him more resilient against enemy fire, but slowed down his movement speed somewhat. In the second game, Chris is capable of holding slightly more ammo for his weapons than the other mercenaries, allowing him to fight for longer in a combat situation. He speaks fluent Korean, likely taught by his mother, who was a Korean translator.Playground of Destruction World in Flames Trivia Related Pages Pirates  The Pirates are a group of Jamaican pirates going by the name of the \"Balseros Crew\" in Mercenaries 2: World in Flames. They are the replacement of the Russian Mafia from Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction. They are largely based on Modern Pirates and Jamaican Organized Crime syndicates, such as the Yardies. They are described as a group of anarchists that, while mostly composed of Jamaicans, accept anyone who can keep up with their wild and vicious antics.Overview  Faction members are easily identified by their dreadlocks and brightly coloured outfits.They carry Machine\u00a0Pistols, Pistols, Shotguns, AK-47 variant of the Assault Rifles, RPGs and Anti-Air Missiles. Their vehicles are painted bright green and yellow and often display flame decals. They have two naval units: the Culican Cutter and the jet ski. They are hostile towards all factions in the game, and thus their own targets and HVT contracts are indiscriminate and target all factions. The Pirates operate an smuggling of weapons, endangered birds, rum, human organs (for humanitarian purposes as seen in \"Black Market Warm Heart\"), civilian and VZ vehicles. Completing the smuggling contracts without losing any cargo gives a huge reward compared to the normal payment ($1-3 million instead of a few thousand). Because of their illegal activities and anarchistic nature, they are hated by every other organization in the game. Working for the Pirates often means working against the other factions. Their buildings have their own architecture and are often decorated with lights. The Pirates possess 2 large satellite dishes but are never used or have any purpose in the game. Some NPC chatter dialogue expresses thoughts related to the satellite dishes; for example \"Where the hell did we get that huge dish?\" Pirates can be found on the islands in the Northern Regions of the map, typically North of Maracaibo and Altagracia, to the North-West of Caracas. The last outpost contract will give them a presence on the Venezuelan Mainland.Details  'Pirates' is a romantic term evoking adventure on the high seas. But these Jamaicans are really just expatriate crooks and thieves who enjoy hijacking ships full of oil or military cargo and selling them on the black market. If there were a stable government in Venezuela, they'd soon be forced out, but in the current chaos, all the organizations in Venezuela enjoy the benefits of dealing with these criminals.Shop  The Pirates are the source of Pirate, civilian, VZ vehicles and a few supply drops:VZ Pirates Civillian Supply Drop Arsenal Infantry Weapons Ground Vehicles Aircraft Members  XBox 360, PC, PS3 version: PS2 version:Trivia People's Liberation Army of Venezuela  The People's Liberation Army of Venezuela (abbreviated as P.L.A.V., PLAV, or just informally known as \"Guerillas\") are a group of left-wing radicals fighting a guerilla war against Ramon Solano's Venezuelan Government. They are present in the Amazonas region of Venezuela, and are constantly in a state of civil war with the Venezuelan Army. They're the second faction the mercenary will meet in Mercenaries 2: World in Flames. Their leader is Marcela Acosta, who resides at their main base inside a large, treaded crane on top of a small mountain. Throughout their bases are many broken-down buses used for shelter and makeshift steel buildings serve as houses along with a broken down commercial plane. Numerous tents are found scattered around their HQ and other places where they have set up their operations.Characteristics  The PLAV are Marxist radicals modeled after such real-life groups as the 26th of July Movement and Revolutionary Armed Forces of Columbia. Their goals are to remove Ramon Solano and his government as well as the Universal Petroleum Corporation and restore the former government. They are a stereotypical guerrilla organization, using outdated, heavily modified equipment and prone to expressing their political views wherever they go. They are sponsored by China, and have access to some Chinese equipment. They are located to the South West of the map, in Merida, near Guanare and the surrounding jungles of the Amazonas. Their uniform consists of mainly a white and light green shirt with the sleeves usually rolled up and matching pants. Some wear red berets which are worn by many revolutionary forces but some wear no headwear at all. They are also known to carry bullet belts. The males are mostly rugged in appearance and many are un shaven, some have sunglasses on and others have wrapped a red bandanna around their mouth. The RPG troops wear sunglasses and a bandanna covering most of their face, they carry a large backpack to hold their rockets in. Female guerrillas wear full camouflage uniform. The PLAV also have elite troops. All of these troops are located nearby HVTs that need to be captured; they sometimes wear a green helmet or a red beret. Some also wear ghillie suits made up of leaves on their back and torso to camouflage themselves and matching green, jungle paint on their skin. They are tougher but have the same weaponry as the normal troops. The PLAV bases usually contain things such as broken buses and other broken down vehicles that have been converted into small buildings and fortifications. They are protected by multi-colored sandbags, usually accompanied by barbed wire and machine gun nests. Their buildings are marked as theirs by orange and green graffiti and barbed wire. They have built many large \"treehouses\" throughout the roads that lead through the Amazonas, which serve as lookouts; they are built around hard, tall trees that are difficult to destroy. In the main PLAV camp, the large crane Acosta herself resides in is a MAN Takraf RB293, naturally tagged with PLAV banners, and fitted with shanty houses and PLAV guerillas alike standing on top of one of them. A female orator can be seen in the camp speaking to three seated guerillas (and presumably the rest of the camp's inhabitants), preaching communist dogma as follows:Weapons and Vehicles  As stated above, their weapons and vehicles are outdated by modern standards. Most of their equipment appears to be Vietnam-era American equipment, such as the M551 Sheridan Tank (Cavalera Light Tank) and the UH-1 Iroquois (Castro Helicopters), while the rest seems to be stolen from the Venezuelan Army. Though outdated, these vehicles are heavily modified. These modifications range from the addition of objects such as cow-catchers, spikes and unnecessary barbed wire. All of their vehicles have some form of graffiti on them, as a further expression of their political views and to make their vehicles look overall more fearsome. Some of their vehicles are named after Latin American revolutionary leaders, such as Simon Bolivar for the name of their armored trucks and Fidel Castro for the name of their main helicopter. Their small arms, however, seem to be largely Soviet in origin. AKM assault rifles, RPK Machine Guns and RPG-7s are their primary weapons. They have a few non-Soviet and more modern weapons, such as the SIG-Sauer P226 pistol, M1014 Shotgun and QBU-88 Sniper Rifle (sold but not used).Vehicles List Ground Vehicles Helicopters Watercraft Market  While hardly as high-tech as the equipment of the other factions, they are nonetheless powerful, effective and inexpensive. These range from RPG drops, to the rapid-firing Bolivar Quad-50 to the heavily-armed Castro-series helicopter gunships. Surprisingly, they sell the Daisy Cutter airstrike.Diplomacy Trivia Ambassador Gunship  The Ambassador Gunship is the Allied Nations main attack helicopter in Mercenaries 2: World in Flames.Overview  The AN equivalent to the Warsong Attack Helicopter, the Ambassador's\u00a0primary armament is a three-barrel M197 20mm cannon. There are three hardpoints (places to launch weapons) on either stub wing. The inboard hardpoints house two LAU-61D/A rocket pods that each hold nineteen (19) 70mm FFARs. The middle hardpoints each house four (4) AGM-114 Hellfire missiles on an M272 missile launcher. The outermost hardpoints (wingtips) each hold one (1) AIM-9 Sidewinder Air-to-Air missile. An Ambassador can be found patrolling at sea (near the restricted oil rig that is adjacent to the Pirates' Central Island Outpost, and the Ambassador will occasionally come and fight with them). Another good spot is in Southern Caracas, near the shipyard outpost used by the AN. Also, this is uncommon (not rare), one can be found just inside of Chinese territory, and another one around the Country Club in Eastern Caracas (near the target buildings the PLA want you to level). You can also unlock the Ambassador delivery support option by completing the AN contract \"Give it A Whirl, Level 3\". You can also get one when you do \"The Price of Gas\" for China flying around the bridge or around the UP fuel depot.Specifications Real life  This helicopter is very odd in terms of a real-world counter part because it is a combination of many different NATO helicopters. The fuselage and Rotor assembly resembles the AH-1Z Viper. Instead it has a ten blade Fenestron rotor built into the tail which is found on Eurocopter HH-65 Dolphin, to see another one you can click hereor here. The engines are from an AH-64 Apache.Trivia See also Russian Mafia  The Russian Mafia (\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043c\u0430\u0444\u0438\u044f, Russkaya Mafiya), Red Mafia (\u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043c\u0430\u0444\u0438\u044f, Krasnaya Mafiya), Bratva (\u0411\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0432\u0430, slang for 'brotherhood') is a Russian Organized Crime group, rising to prominence in the political, economic and social turmoil following the fall of the Soviet Union. Russian organized crime has existed well before the fall of the Soviet Union, but it has hit its stride in the years since. During its formation, many members were veterans of the Russian Armed Forces, including members of the state intelligence group and secret police force, the KGB, who were suddenly out of work and had the skills to excel in the world of crime. While primarily a Russian organization, the Russian Mafia operates across the globe in a wide variety of criminal activities such as prostitution, drugs, gambling and extortion, though reportedly specialize in smuggling black-market goods and money laundering.Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction  The Russian Mafia are one of the five factions in Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction. They are very different from all the other factions in the game, and not just because they are not an army representing a cause and nation. Unlike the Chinese, who want to annex North Korea, the South Koreans, who want to reunify North Korea with them under their government, the Allied Nations, who want to find North Korea's nuclear weapons and disable them and capture or kill Choi Song, and the North Koreans, who oppose the goals of everyone else, the Russian Mafia is in North Korea to work their way into NK society and engage in as much looting and war profiteering as possible while the fighting goes on. The Russian Mafia is in North Korea to make money, and they never pretend otherwise. This selfish and materialistic goal makes the Russian Mafia an ideal potential friend, ally, and employer of the Executive Operations mercenary. Both the mercenary and the Mafia are not in North Korea for patriotism or any political cause- money is the primary motivation and concern for both of them. The Russian Mafia stands to make a truly spectacular profit if its operations in North Korea are successful, and they are more than willing to share that profit if the mercenary helps them along the way. However, the other factions all have strong disagreements with the Mafia, as they are unwilling to make room for organized crime in their goals for North Korea. Though they wield immense financial and political power and influence, the Mafia is first and foremost a criminal organization and therefore has no major military presence in North Korea. However, its well-armed thugs and customized vehicles patrol the streets of many North Korean cities, including the capital, Pyongyang. The men working for the Russian Mafia go well-armed and even start fielding light attack helicopters during the game. Most Mafia Thugs carry Type 85 Sub-Machine Guns and most Capos (officers) carry Shotguns. The Mafia Enforcers are equipped with RPD light machine guns, Dragunov SVD's, and RPGs. But the Mafia still have the lightest ground presence out of all the factions, with few men and no tanks or APCs, and very few helicopters. The Northern Province, however, has a vast presence of Mafia Technicals and SUVs, presumably since at this point, there is no Allied or NK navy blockade to stop their import. Any land vehicle can be sold to the Mafia's chop shop. High-end vehicles (such as tanks) are naturally worth the most money. The less damaged the vehicle being delivered is, the more the Mafia will pay for it. They do not reduce payment if a vehicle has less ammunition than its full capacity, however. This is the only way outside of missions and killing NK, SK, or Chinese soldiers to raise the player's standing with the Mafia. The Russian Mafia also runs the Merchant of Menace shop, which can be accessed via your PDA. This shop allows you to purchase vehicles and supply drops, as well as air strikes unlocked throughout the game. If the Mafia becomes hostile to the player, the player will be locked out of the shop. The shop also increases prices the more unfriendly the Mafia is to the player, and lowers it if they become friendlier. If the player works with the Russian Mafia steadily and assists them in making higher and higher profits as their operations become broader and more daring, the game can end with the Russian Mafia firmly in control in North Korea if they are the most friendly faction to the player. The Russian Mafia never meant to just come to North Korea, make a big profit during the war, and then leave; they fully intended to settle in for a long and very profitable stay. Whether it is China or South Korea who absorb defeated North Korea with the player's aid, the Russian Mafia- if the player has consistently aided them- has a strong grip on North Korea and will not give it up easily.Soldier Classes Characters Named Characters Unnamed Characters Arsenal Infantry Weapons Aircraft Ground Vehicles Diplomacy  Allies: N/A Enemies: All factions.

The country comprises a continental mainland and numerous islands located off the Venezuelan coastline in the Caribbean Sea. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela possesses borders with Guyana to the east, Brazil to the south, and Colombia to the west. Trinidad and Tobago, Grenada, St. Lucia, Barbados, Cura\u00e7ao, Bonaire, Aruba, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and the Leeward Antilles lie just north, off the Venezuelan coast. Venezuela, formerly a Spanish colony, has been an independent republic since 1821. It is well known for its petroleum deposits, and is a member nation of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC.Mercenaries 2: World in Flames  Venezuela, or more commonly written as VZ and VZA (Venezuelan Army), refers to the Venezuelan Army as a faction led by Ramon Solano in Mercenaries 2: World in Flames. It is always diplomatically an enemy with your character and every other faction, excluding the opening mission, where you are rescuing General Carmona. Even then, you are fighting a splinter group of VZ soldiers who opposed the earlier coup attempt against the former government by Carmona before the PMC arrived in the country. The VZ occupy the majority of Venezuela at the start of the game after The Betrayal, mostly cities such as Guanare and Merida. The Venezuelan Army and government were taken over by Ramon Solano and a general in Solano's employ, Carlos Carmona. The Venezuelan Army is fully equipped with tanks, aircraft and naval forces. They are recognizable by their brown/orange camouflage uniforms and dark brown vehicles. As the game progresses, your character captures and destroys their outposts for rival factions. While the government of Venezuela is oppressive, many citizens of Venezuela still appear to support Solano over the People's Liberation Army of Venezuela. This can be deduced from their dialogue and often referring Acosta as being a joke. Venezuelan Army troop morale appears to be very high. From the dialogue it can be assumed that they strongly support Solano and his goal to make a South American super power. Exceptions apply to HVTs which can sometimes surrender to the player, though most of them at least express strong verbal defiance and support to Solano until the moment they are taken away or killed. It also seems that the soldiers do not get to see their families often.Vehicles  The VZ are a fully equipped army with vehicles ranging from jeeps, tanks, helicopters, patrol boats and sports cars. The most commonly seen vehicle is the Iguana jeep, which serves as a scout vehicle for the VZ. Their primary tank is the Jaguar, which also comes in a heavy version which is one of the most durable tanks in the game. Their scout tank is the Puma light tank but it goes into disuse as the warzone intensifies. The most used helicopters of the VZ are the Kestrel light helicopters, but most of the heavy fighting is performed by the mighty Anaconda attack copters. On the sea their general use vehicle is the Piranha patrol boat, one of the most balanced patrol boats in the game.Ground vehicles Helicopters Boats Emplaced weapons Soldier classes VZA dialogue Friendly (glitched or when disguised) Hostile High value target Miscellaneous Trivia See also Eva Navarro  Eva Navarro is a Venezuelan mechanic and PMC recruit featured in Mercenaries 2: World in Flames.History  The player first hears of her after gaining information from helicopter pilot Ewan, saying that \"everybody hates her,\" and that she is \"right up your alley.\" The player proceeds to her garage near the \"abandoned\" strip mine. After talking to her, she agrees to join the player if he/she agrees to test drive one of her prototype creations, a large monster truck. The player drives through the strip mine, avoiding booby traps, PLAV and VZ troops, and using the truck's hydraulic jets (which provide limited flight) to navigate the harsh terrain. The player has to successfully navigate the mine by passing a series of checkpoints without totally destroying the truck, and eventually make it back to the garage, gaining Eva's help. As she enters the PMC, she throws a knife at one of Solano's portraits, later apologizing for \"over-reacting.\" In the PS2 version of Mercenaries 2, Eva is said to be a native Venezuelan, as one of her quotes indicate: \"My country is in ruins, and business is terrible.\"In-game Role  Eva is a mechanic and engineer, and, naturally, takes up residence in the PMC garage. Like all other recruits she offers wagers that are rewarded with cash and custom vehicles. She offers two types of wagers: races and destruction races. Races are very much alike to the first test drive for Eva, with the player passing a series of checkpoints before running out of time. Destruction races are almost the same thing, but with the player having the option to destroy targets around the course for extra time and rewards. Provided with enough spare part kits, which can be found scattered all around Venezuela, you can purchase custom vehicles from her to be available in the stockpile. This includes vehicles such as the Panzercycle, Vulcan 4x4, The Urban Commando, and many more.Personality and Appearance  Eva has red hair. She wears various equipment and tools around her waist and a small pack on her back. When you accept a challenge for a destruction race or ordinary race she seems reluctant to gamble against the player's abilities, and afterwards she regrets the idea, but will continue to offer them. She is also openly annoyed with Ewan's nonstop talking, where she sometimes states how she would rig his helicopter to explode if he talked.How to Recruit  In the PS3, XBox 360 and PC versions, Eva requires you to test-drive one of her custom-made vehicles, the Cacharro de Muerte. In the PS2 version, you must help her assemble a monster truck, \"El Diablo,\" for her client, as well as deliver it while avoiding the Pirates of the Balseros Crew, who want to thwart Eva's efforts.Trivia Related Pages North Korea  North Korea, the commonly used short name for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) is a nation located in the northern half of the Korean Peninsula, bordering South Korea to the south, China to the north and Russia to the extreme north east. North and South Korea have been split since the end of World War II and tensions between them have been tense. The current leader is Kim Jong-un, heir to his father Kim Jong-il, who died in December of 2011. North Korea is largely regarded as a Stalinist dictatorship, with elements of a \"Cult of Personality.\" In October of 2006, North Korea tested its first nuclear weapon, reportedly with mixed success.Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction  In the game, the history of North Korea is somewhat different. It has a president, something that hasn't happened since 1994, when Kim-Il Sung died. In the years preceding Mercenaries (2009), North Korea consolidates its military power and strengthens its ties with terrorists. In 2009, North Korea attempts to reach out to the world in peace, but Choi Song, the President's son, seizes power in North Korea and turns it into an isolated state. For more info on this pivotal event refer to the Song Initiative page.The Korean People's Army (KPA)  North Korea (specifically, the military) is one of five factions in Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction as well as the setting for the majority of the game (some sections of the Northern Province are in China). Equally infamous and mysterious, North Korea was closed to the rest of the world since its foundation with the backing of the Soviet Union just after the end of World War II. While foreign armies have succeeded in seizing control of most of North Korea's air, sea and land territory, the Korean People's Army, the military of North Korea, remains at large in significant numbers. Prior to the invasion, the KPA boasted the largest standing army in the world. They are completely hostile to the mercenary and all other factions, and are deadset on driving the foreigners out of North Korea. The KPA's vehicles, equipment and weaponry all have two things in common: virtually all of the designs originate in the Soviet Union, and all of the hardware in the KPA's use is old and in many cases severely out of date, making the Korean People's Army dead last in the game for level of technological advancement. Though it has taken a beating from the invaders, the KPA remains a deadly threat given its sheer numbers of personnel, vast array of firepower, and the presence of many skilled and fanatical leaders (the Deck of 52, apart from the Clubs, who are civilian \"businessmen\") who continue to work relentlessly to make the KPA's strengths compensate for its weaknesses. The KPA is led by the ruthless Choi Song, who at first is believed to have killed his father, Choi Kim to seize power over the nation. The Army, fearful of losing its power, backed Choi Song in his successful effort to destroy the imminent peaceful reunification of Korea under the government in Seoul. It now follows Choi Song wherever he chooses to lead it, whatever the cost may be to the KPA- or anyone else.KPA Soldier Classes  The KPA have a basic variety of troops in Playground of Destruction.The Deck of 52  The Deck of 52 is a list of the most wanted men and women within the North Korean chain of command. Each suit of cards in the deck represents a group devoted towards a certain activity assigned to them by Song to advance his goals of conquest. These suits are:Mercenaries 2: World in Flames  Although the North Korean faction make no appearance in the sequel, they are mentioned briefly by Solano, and it is implied they supplied him with the nuclear weapon he used against the AN and Chinese.Vehicles Aircraft Ground Vehicles Diplomat Heavy Tank  \"Cover me! I'm going for that badass tank!\" \u2014Soldiers from all factions The Diplomat Heavy Tank is the Allied Nations' heavy and only tank in Mercenaries 2: World in Flames.Overview  The Diplomat is equal to the Chinese Iron Mountain Heavy Tank in armor and in damage output from the main gun. The Iron Mountain Tank cost less fuel at 220 gallons, while the Diplomat costs more fuel at 240 gallons.\u00a0 This tank moves more quickly than most others, and can travel up anything but a vertical surface while maintaining a decent amount of speed to work with. It can actually run over and destroy almost any vehicle smaller or shorter, even another Iron Mountain or Diplomat tank if the player manages to run it over. The tank can run into or over\u00a0anything, even at top speed, and take no damage. (That is, excepting IED's, landmines, and airstrikes.) Bullets, including heavy machine gun bullets and anti-material rifles, will also do absolutely zero percent damage to the tank. However; like most vehicles, this tank has weaker rear armor; a shot from another heavy tank will destroy it. This is the only tank in the game with a minigun. The armor of the Diplomat may be tough but getting caught in the blast of a Fuel Air RPG will destroy the tank. Do not hold this against it, however, as a Fuel Air RPG blast can destroy literally any vehicle. It is difficult to hijack a Diplomat because the player needs to press the corresponding button shown while wrestling a grenade from the driver very fast. Its advantage over the Iron Mountain Heavy Tank is increased speed of movement but at the cost of a larger profile. Making it easier and harder to hit in two different ways. However, the Diplomat's higher profile allows it to bulldoze its way over anything, unlike the Iron Mountain, which gets stuck getting over wall rubble. This tank is not hard to destroy, two blocks of C-4 are actually enough to set the engine on fire, thus disabling the tank.Tactics  Fuel air explosions are probably the deadliest things a Diplomat will encounter; should you be in an area with large amounts of fuel air launchers, it is advised to never stop moving. The Diplomat is fast enough to be hit by the initial rocket, and speed away before the explosion. Trying to reverse out of the cloud or turn away will result in the destruction of the tank. In terms of fire power, the Diplomat's cannon fires sabot rounds which should have more power than the Iron Mountain tanks' 125 mm gun which fires HEAT round, while in game there seems to be no difference. The main gun fires shells at an extreme velocity. They hit almost instantaneously upon firing. The damage each shell does is massive. It will one-shot any other tank in the game save the Iron Mountain Heavy Tank. They are vulnerable to attack helicopters with AT-missiles or rockets, if they are not taken out quickly, they will easily wreck any type of opposition. Do not expose the rear of the tank to incoming fire to prolong survivability. It will take extra damage if hit in the rear. The main gun fires shells at an extreme velocity.Armor and Damage  The armor of the Diplomat can withstand (damage\u00a0% is rounded to nearest multiple of 5 or 0.5):Blow it Up Again  In the Mercs Blitz mission from the Blow It Up Again DLC pack (and only in this mission), the player drives an upgraded version of the Diplomat with a railgun cannon, covered 7.62mm Minigun and twin TOW launchers. Another feature is a mounted \"plowing\" barrier. It is upgraded with more speed, but just like all tanks, the weak point is the rear.Locations Real Life  The Diplomat is based on the M1A2 Abrams main battle tank with the M1A2 TUSK (Tank Urban Survival Kit) add-on armor kit, as shown by the square shaped bricks on the side of the tank which are the Explosive Reactive Armor (ERA) bricks. However, the 105MM gun indicates it to be modified from a reserve M1 Abrams or a new export model entirely.Trivia See Also Ewan Devlin/Garrett  Ewan Devlin is an Irish helicopter pilot and PMC recruit featured in Mercenaries 2: World In Flames.History  He spent too much time chasing girls to take any career seriously. He eventually had a short and controversial stay in the military where he became a helicopter pilot. He took that training and worked as a freelance mercenary in Iraq and Darfur. He was eventually hired by Universal Petroleum and worked for them in Venezuela. During the Venezuelan Conflict, Ewan worked for the Venezuelan branch of Universal Petroleum. He assisted the mercenary in dropping listening posts to triangulate the location of a kidnapped UP executive. Lamenting that they \"did not have an Irish guy\", the Mercenary suggested that Ewan leave\u00a0Universal Petroleum and work for the PMC. Ewan then left UP and joined the Mercenary and Fiona Taylor in their mission to hunt down Ramon Solano and gave them information on a local mechanic, Eva. He is extremely vital to the Mercenary's efforts, as he is the only way that the vehicles and supplies the Mercenary purchases are delivered to the combat area. Personality wise, Ewan is laid back and (mostly) calm, though sometimes appearing to be a little lazy as well as highly narcissistic. His own corner of the Private Military Company'sHQ with a zebra-skin rug, a comfortable couch, softly glowing candles, a curtain held up by a broken helicopter rotor and pictures of women in various states of undress that are holding various weapons. Ewan is also a womanizer, and has made separate advances towards Eva and Fiona as well as bragging to his boss about women he brings over to the PMC. While reportedly an experienced combat pilot, he openly admits to never \"intentionally\" flying into a warzone and will flee if the drop area is not relatively free of enemy ground fire. He also finds Fiona using weapons to be \"arousing\". Ewan's personal helicopters are a unique UH-1 Iroquois (known in-game as Castro Helicopters) painted green and with a pin-up girl on the side and an Mi-26 \"Halo\" (a Jade Wind Heavy Transport or Condor), also painted with an Irish theme and one or more of pin-up girls on the sides. Ewan can be seen driving a Toucan Transport at one point in the story (see Trivia). He flies the Castro type helicopter when delivering packages and light vehicles, which is called \"The Lucky Lady,\" while only flying the Condor type for heavier vehicles, which is called \"The Lucky Ladies.\"Appearance  Ewan wears a green flight top with no sleeves. He wears long brown pants with a belt around his waist with a couple of gun and ammo pouches. He has pale white skin and short brown hair cut in a \"Sarge\" style with buzzard hair on the sides. He is commonly seen with either a match or cigarette in his mouth. He has numerous tattoos on both his shoulders and upper arm. He is also seen wearing brown gloves.Recruiting  In the PS3, PC and XBox 360 versions of Mercenaries 2, Ewan joins with the PMC after finishing UP's \"Phone Tag\" contract. In the PS2 version, the player must help Ewan recover his helicopter and fly all the way back to the villa whilst being assaulted by VZ soldiers.Trivia Related Pages Weapons  A weapon is any piece of machinery, fixed or held, that causes harm to another being.Fiona Taylor  Fiona Taylor is a recurring support character in the Mercenaries series. She is commonly portrayed as a technical support for the player.History  Fiona was previously a member of the Royal Australian Navy as a lieutenant, specializing in submarine electronics warfare, and then as an operative for the ASIS (Australian Secret Intelligence Service) but then gave it up fairly early to join ExOps due to preferring to actually use computers, instead of just fixing them.Playground of Destruction  In Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction, Fiona provides technical support for the player during his/her stay in North Korea. She is never physically seen in the game, operating outside the theatre of battle, she does however, have a portrait in the instruction manual for the game, which shows her as having blonde hair.World in Flames  During the events of Mercenaries 2: World in Flames, Fiona continues to act as the technical support for the three mercenaries after their departure from ExOps. She appears to have developed a more aggressive personality, pulling a gun out at Ewan and Eva when they first join the PMC. She also appears to have dyed her hair, as it is now red as opposed to blonde from the first game. During the UP contract \"Phone Tag,\" it is revealed that after an operation with the mercenaries in Montenegro, something went wrong with the people they were working with and from that point on they agreed to work alone, however they realised that needed more operatives and opted to create the Private Military Company. Also the pink Racing Inferno that appears outside the entrance of the villa is owned by Fiona. When the mercenary gets into it she will become angry and say things such as \"Don't take my car, DON'T TAKE MY...oh, never mind...\". If the vehicle gets destroyed either by enemy gunfire or just careless driving, you will have to pay $10,000 in reparations to Fiona. After the player beats Fiona's Challenges on Level 2 inside the Villa, they will receive a supply drop called \"Fiona's Favourites.\" This supply crate contains the PDW machine pistol. It also contains ammo, grenades, several C4 charges and a med kit.Trivia Mi-35 Gunship  Were you looking for the Anaconda? The Mercenaries 2 version of this vehicle The Mi-35 Gunship is the North Korean army's main gunship that is featured in Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction. The Mi-35 is very similar to the Anaconda, which appears in Mercenaries 2: World in Flames.Overview  The KPA Mi-35 Gunship is one of the most powerful helicopters in Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction. Unobtainable in the southern province, it only appears in the northern province during the later stages of the game. It is most often used by special members of the North Korean forces, such as the Defender of Hwangbo during the first Ace contract. It can be found on the ground during the contract \"Inspect and Verify\". Heavily armored and armed with a minigun, anti-tank rockets and 57mm rocket pods, the Mi-35 is a force to be reckoned with over North Korea's battlefields. It can be a strong asset or a dangerous enemy depending on whose hands it is in. The Mi-35 is the best helicopter in the entire game in terms of the strength of its armor and the number of roles it can fill. Its armor is strong enough to render it impervious to even the most sustained small-arms fire; only anti-tank and anti-air weapons can damage it. The real-life Mi-24/Mi-35 was designed to be able to operate in a contaminated environment, a characteristic it retains in-game: the Mi-35 is NBC (Nuclear Biological Chemical) shielded and can be safely flown into radioactive areas in North Korea without consequence. The Mi-35 is the only helicopter in the game armed like an attack helicopter yet also able to carry troops; its troop bay can hold up to four. The two \"bubble\" cockpits featured are for the pilot (rear one) and weapons systems operator (front one). Only the pilot cockpit can be manned, as the flight and weapons controls are both available to the player from the pilot's cockpit. When the mercenary destroys an Mi-35, they will be paid $10,000.Tactics  No other helicopter in Playground of Destruction can do all the things that the Mi-35 can. It is heavily-armed and armored, able to fight like the heavy attack helicopter it was designed to be. An Mi-35 can tear through enemy armor no matter who the player is fighting, and its nose-mounted minigun can rip apart anything not protected against small-arms fire. The Mi-35's non-guided rocket pods are useful for when the pilot either desires to not expend one of the 8 guided anti-tank missiles on a less important target, or if the 8 missiles have already been expended. The Mi-35's troop bay can hold up to four passengers, allowing it to be used for combat-focused contracts, extraction or transportation contracts, or work involving any combination of these three. Its NBC shielding enables it to fly safely into and out of the radioactive areas found in North Korea without any harm to the pilot or passengers. In addition to attack and troop transport duties, the Mi-35 carries a sturdy magnetic winch, allowing it to lift and carry a wide range of vehicles in the game. Like all other helicopters in Playground of Destruction, main battle tanks are among a handful of vehicles that are too heavy for the Mi-35 to lift. The Mi-35's status as a North Korean-marked vehicle enables it to fulfill a fourth major role; infiltration. Despite heavy setbacks against the invaders, the Korean People's Army is still one of the largest armies in North Korea, and the Mi-35 can use its disguise to get into areas the KPA remains in control of without detection- a priceless asset for the AN contract in which four weapons inspectors have been captured and must be rescued from KPA territory. Like any disguised vehicle, a player-flown Mi-35 will be identified as a fake if it comes too close to an officer of any faction; in KPA-held areas this could be disastrous, so distance must be kept from officers. Using the North Korean disguise, you could pick up a soldier with anti-tank/anti-air weapons, a sniper rifle, or any other soldiers of your choice, making an effective assault team. Go into a North Korean controlled area with these soldiers, avoid officers, drop off the soldiers and fly out, then watch your soldiers go to work. This is very useful for diverting enemy forces away from you, and can also be useful in holed up areas. When encountering a hostile Mi-35, the player must destroy it quickly or bail out if driving any ground vehicle; KPA pilots will mercilessly rain rockets and anti-tank missiles on the player, and not even the mighty M1 Tank can stand up to that for long. Calling in an airstrike to deal with it, using vehicle-mounted or shoulder-fired anti-air weapons, or simply retreating from the area and evading pursuit will be necessary. A daring but practical option is to get underneath the Mi-35 on foot, and move around to stay under it, until the Mi-35 flies low enough for the option to hijack it to appear. Trying to hijack an airborne Mi-35 can be time-consuming and dangerous, but well worth it if the effort results in the vehicle's capture.Locations  There are a couple of Mi-35 Gunships next to where the Three of Hearts is hiding which isn't very hard to find and many Deck of 52 members in the northern province usually have at least one protecting him/her. Mi-35s can usually be found north and north-east of Changsong Train Station in the Northern province. An easy way to obtain one while first in the northern province is to get a North Korean MD-500 Scout, wait until disguised, then fly a little north until you see a number card with one of these nearby. Don't capture him yet, as until you capture the ace, the copter will respawn each time a contract is completed, or if you reload the game. If you come disguised in the MD-500, you can land right beside the Mi-35 and take it with little difficulty, because none of the guards carry heavy weapons capable of damaging the copter.Real Life  The Mi-35 Gunship is based on the Mil Mi-24/35 Gunship. 35 denotes the export model, intended for sale to foreign countries. Since North Korea has never produced its own Mi-24/35 helicopters, they would have purchased export model Mi-35s from the Soviet Union. The Mi-24/35, like all Soviet-made aircraft and helicopters, is identified by the American-led NATO alliance by a reporting name. The name assigned to the Mi-24/35 is \"Hind\". The Mi-24/Mi-35 saw its first flight in 1969 and entered service in 1972. Like nearly all of the reliable, simple, and rugged vehicles designed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War, the Mi-24/35 was exported to numerous pro-Soviet nations and was adopted by every member of the Warsaw Pact. It is used by more than twenty countries as of 2016 and has been modified for various military and police roles. The Mi-24/35 has been referred to as the world's only \"assault helicopter\", due to its rare combination of the firepower of an attack helicopter with transportation capabilities. An Mi-24/35 is capable of carrying enough weight, between its own weight, its weapons and ordnance load, and passengers and equipment, that a fully-loaded Mi-24/35 cannot always perform a verticle takeoff. It is sometimes necessary for the helicopter to take off with a rolling start, almost like a fixed-wing aircraft instead of a helicopter. Soviet and Russian pilots have referred to the Mi-24/35 as the \"flying tank\", the \"crocodile\", and the \"drinking glass\". The first of those refers to its heavy armor and firepower, unusual on a helicopter, and was a nickname previously given to the famous Ilyushin Il-2 \"Shturmovik\" ground attack aircraft of World War II. The second refers to the Mi-35's elongated appearance, somewhat resembling a crocodile. The last nickname doesn't refer to the Mi-35 as it appears in \"Playground of Destruction\", but rather the flat glass plates that surrounded the cockpits of early Mi-24 models.Related Pages ", "Ameriv": "Ameriv COSMOS BRAINPOOL AMERIV Ameriv  Quelle xxx\nAmeriv-Network: Ameriv | FKJ | websitewiki | Portale \nWiki Wisdom | VisualDNA\nAmeriv.de | Ameriv.wikia.com\nanswers.wikia User | answers.wikia Benutzer | AmerivFragen | NervWikia\nsupport wikia | Magazine Creator | Wikia Staff Blog\nAvatar | Mta\u00c4 gello 13:56, 1.

It\u00b4s inhabitants were the children of Eru, the Elves, Hildor (or mortals, including men and Halflings), Dwarves and Ents as well as the Melkorindi or Uvanimar, the Orcs, Trolls and Dragons. Middle-Earth was also known to be the Home of a number of lesser Ainur or Maiar and enigmatic peoples as the Giants and a countless number of Olvar and Kelvar or Plants and Animals. The best known part of Arda were the Westlands, roughly the northwestern part of the continent with the icy Forodwaith in the north, the hot Haradwaith in the south, the Sea of Rh\u00fbn in the east and the great ocean Belegaer in the west.It comprised the Lands of Lindon, Eriador (Including the lost Kingdom of Arnor and its successor realms as well as Enedwaith), Rohan (or Calenardhon), the Lands of Rhovanion, the southern Kingdom of Gondor and the dark land of Mordor. The Lands of Rh\u00fbn and Haradwaith were known quite well in the southern kingdom of Gondor since they once were provinces of it\u00b4s dominion, the Lands further to the east and south were known as the Wild Lands east and South, Tribal areas often under the sway of the dark Lord or inhabited by wild rebellious tribes loyal to none but themselves.The N\u00famen\u00f3reans had built many colonies in the south along the western coast, many of which later became the homelands of the so-called black n\u00famen\u00f3reans. See:The Shape of Middle-Earth in the Third Age  What did Middle-Earth actually look like outside the Westlands? While Professor Tolkien gave us quite a good set of Maps to imagine what he had in mind for the Westlands and Beleriand in the First and late Third Ages he only gave vague hints to the geography of the entire continent. His writings offer us some hints, the Orocarni are mentioned as a great mountain chain in the farthest east, he mentions wild woods in the east (around the Bay of Cuivienen), great pinewoods to the North (north of Helcar and Cuivienen), the Iron Forest in the world's center and the great forests of the south (south of Umbar of Far Harad), the Great Inland Seas of Helcar and Ormal,vast Grass plains in Palisor, implied to stretch between Cuivienen and the later Inland sea of Rh\u00fbn, the Lake of Almaren in the center of the World, A mountain chain known as the Mountains of the Wind near to the Murmenalda in the Land of Hildorien (once implied to correspond with mesopotamia) and another unnamed mountain chain (with the place of awakening of the fourth and fifth tribe of the Eastern Dwarves) implied to have been situated half way between the Orocarni and the Iron Hills, the great Iron Mountains and old Utumno in the far North, deserts (The Harad Desert and the last Desert in the east (implied to correspond with the deserts of China) and wooded coastal lands and former Black N\u00famen\u00f3rean Colonies along the Cragged Coasts of Harad and several island chains in the Belegaer.However aside from brief mentioning these geographic features we don't get map material to illustrate them or give us a better idea about Ambar outside the Northwest.Except for a few rough Sketches and Drawings. Best known are his raw sketches published in The Shaping of Middle-Earth which give us a clue how he imagined the entire continent (and indeed also Aman, Southernesse and Easternesse, Ambars other three major landmasses) to look like. He drew a very quick Sketch of Beleriand as the northwesternmost tip of a somewhat larger continent which strongly resembled Africa to the south, the Arabian peninsula at the centre, India or Thailand/Myanmar/Cambodia/Vietnam in the southeast and China in the far east. Also his Sketch gives us hints about the Great Mountain chains (Hithaeglir, Ered Engrin, Orocarni, Mountains of the Wind) and mentions two more\u00a0:the Yellow Mountains and the Grey Mountains , gives us a better idea of the inland sea of Helcar and the Bay of Ormal, Hildorien, Cuivienen, Almaren and the continent known as the Dark Lands or Southernesse, often compared by commentators to Australia, Antarctica, Oceania and Indonesia, as well as Easternesse and Aman, which were sometimes compared to the Americas, Lemuria and Mu. Two more less known and less frequently hints may be Tolkiens early drawing of the \"World Ship\" and the World of Arda, published in the Book of Lost Tales and a painting by Professor Tolkien , entitled The Man in the Moon, showing the Moon with it's Towers, and faraway, Planet Earth, with the continents Northamerica, Eurasia, Africa and possibly Atlantis and Mu or Lemuria. While certainly an important source these drawings are also often considered just rough drafts, early processing steps which just represent very early concepts Professor Tokien never again revisited and never officially published in his lifetime. While many later interpreters tried to stay as close as possible to these Sketches, others argued that Tolkien certainly would have reworked and revisited his earliest Sketches and would have altered them to avoid a too strong resemblance to modern maps of our modern Earth's Landmasses.On the other hand, the close resemblance of the Professor's Shaping of Middle-Earth Maps to early illustrations of Plate tectonics have inspired several Artists to elaborate the similarities between Ambar and Pangaea or Middle-Earth/Southernesse and Laurasia/Gondwanaland (In fact The Professor's Sketches predated the modern maps and Theories of Plate tectonics). Karen Wynn Fonstad's The Atlas of Middle-Earth stayed very close to Professor Tokien's early Ambarkanta Sketches, but added the Lord of the Rings maps as a link between the Beleriand map and the continental sketches. An Artist's Interpretation of Middle Earth, including the wild lands east,south and north by Pete Fenlon went the other way and, while still loosely based of Tolkien's Ambarkanta Sketches, tried to alter the continent's Shape in the attempt to create a continent that bore as little resemblence to Africa or Asia as the Westlands did to europe (while Pete Fenlon still included some allusions to real-world geographical features). Both Maps (and many others inspired by them, such as the maps published by David Day in his Tolkien illustrated encyclopedia) were however often criticized as being to small in scale. Professor Tolkien gave us a brief hint about the extent of Middle-Earth by making Aragorn give the expression \"(...)the far countries of Rh\u00fbn and Harad where the stars are strange (...)\" implying that the Lands of Far Rh\u00fbn and Far Harad extended quite far over the southern and eastern hemisphere.In Theory the landmass of Middle-earth should correspond roughly with those of Pangaea (in the Elder Days) or Eurafrasia (in the second and Third Ages), however Professor Tolkien's earliest sketches indeed seem to show a far smaller continent if the relation of Beleriand to the rest of the continent would be taken as literal and intentional, and indeed both Fonstad and Fenlon drew maps of comparatively small continents whose southern coasts barely touched the equator and whose eastern coastlines barely went beyond the 80\u00b0 or 110\u00b0 degree of longitude. In the absence of a truly accurate and reliable authorized map, so far all maps depicting Arda, Middle-Earth or Ambar's other continents , especially if set after the First Age, have to be seen as mere interpretations, as imprecise and speculative as antique or medieval maps of our own world,or any World map before the 18th and 19th century.Names References Men  Men, known as the Hildor, were the race of mortals who dwelt in Middle-earth and throughout the world of Arda. In the widest sense also the Hobbits were considered mortals and therefore Hildor (although considered Halflings, not Men in the strict sense).The Hildor were divided into those who wandered westwards in the first Age, the Lintador and those who had remained in the east and spread to the wild Lands east and south in the later Ages, the Aravador.An Overview of Men  The Elves (Quendi), who were the Firstborn, called Men the Atani, or Secondborn, or the Apanonar, the After-born. They also named them the Children of the Sun; for, to the Elves, the Sun itself was a new star in the age-old sky, and Men awoke in the light of its birth. Mankind was always most comforted by the great orb's golden rays. For that reason, Men also earned the appelation Night-fearers, since they trembled in the gentle starlight which set Elves and Orcs most at ease. The greater lore of the Elves sometimes counted Men as the Hildor, the Followers (although this more properly refers to those who entered Beleriand). After their first, short generation in Arda, how- ever, the Quendi perceived the Secondborn's strange and weak na- ture. Thus, Men were deemed Engwar, the Sickly; and Firimar, the Mortals. In time, the passing of unkind Men, unkind deeds, and unkind circumstances gave birth to other names: the Strangers, the Usurpers, the Self-cursed, and the Heavy-handed. They were also called the Inscrutable.The Nature of Men  Called the Younger Children of Eru, or the Secondborn, Men were created after the noble Elves. They appeared to be the least of Eru's intelligent creations, for their spirits embodied much less strength than those of the Ainur (i.e., the Valar and Maiar) and, in contrast to Elves and Dwarves, they were short-lived and vulner- able to all the hardships of life: disease, poison, and the weather. Men bore the memories of their many struggles not only in their minds and hearts, but also in the scars on their bodies. In form and face, they lacked the great beauty of the Eldar and enjoyed nothing of the glory of the Calaquendi. Compared to the great magics, cultures, skills, and refinements of the Elves and Dwarves, the works of Men seemed pitiable and primitive. Yet, for all this, they were the best loved by Eru. He made them alone at the first rising of the Sun. No Vala shared in their birth, no Eldar beheld their creation, and no Maia represented them as their special patron. And He gave to them a unique gift, first thought by their immortal older brothers, the Elves, to be a curse: death. Men died as a matter of course, without violence, without calamity, simply by the passing of years and the wearing-out of their bodies. Death was Eru's blessing, though, for it left Men unshackled by fate and destiny \u2014 as were the Elves, who often suffered from the burden of a preordained doom. The Firstborn, while immortal of body, wearied in spirit over the course of ages, but the spirits of the Secondborn burned with a passion for life and a need to savor each precious moment. No undying Elf could understand the desperate but energetic nature of mortal Men. Most importantly, Eru' s gift created a mystery that shrouded the most fundamental aspect of the nature of Men: their eternal destiny. The ultimate fate of a Man's spirit was unknown, even to the Valar (save Namo). Men did not, at the end of their brief lifespans, come to dwell in the Undying Lands of Aman. Instead, their souls passed beyond Arda, finding eternity cradled in the welcoming arms of the One. The Secondborn resided with and in Eru, rather than walking in the lesser glory of the Valar. Such is the great Gift of Death, Eru's bequest to His Younger Children.A Brief History of Men  The first of Men, the Elder Lords, the friends of Quendi and Ulmo, were called Atanatari; the Fathers of Men. They awoke with the Sun in eastern Middle-earth, during the Second Spring of Arda, and their coming signaled a change in Arda. The Years of the Sun burned with a bright light and passed quickly. Life abounded \u2014 rising, aging, changing, and dying as never before\u2014and Endor's air grew heavy with a sense of birth and rebirth. The unhurried, placid Years of the Trees became a gentle memory, and the Long Night that gripped the world ended in the splendid dawn.Arda and the First Sunrise  During the Sunless Year that followed the death of the [[Two Trees]] of Valinor, only Ulmo, the capricious master of the waters, kept watch on the Middle Land. He gleaned knowledge from the oceans that surrounded Endor's shores, and the waters that ran through and beneath its fields. This knowledge came to Aman and the other Valar, but their thoughts turned away from Middle-earth, They left the proud, cursed Noldor to their doom. As the Sun first crossed the sky above Middle-earth, the Valar resided in Aman, behind the sheer mountain walls of Pelori. They guarded their land from the ravages of their fallen brother, Morgoth. Leaving a sleepless watch at Calacirya, the only unclosed pass into Aman, they shut the Undying Lands to all but those Faithful Elves who were capable of crossing the bewitching storms and shadows of the Great Sea between Endor and Arda. The Powers entrusted with Arda's wardship neglected their appointed cause, while the Black Enemy extended his terror in Middle-earth. Noldor courage stood as the only obstacle to Morgoth's victory. There was little hope beneath the first sunrise.The Birth of Men  It was then that Mankind awoke in number. Gathering in Hildorien (Q. \"Land of the Followers\")\u2014beneath the eastern face of the Mountains of the Wind and beside the cool waters of the Encircling Sea \u2014 they rose from their short slumber. No Vala or Elf beheld their wakening, for their coming was the thought and the pleasure of their Father Eru. He smiled down on his Younger Children, alone and joyful, knowing that their birth brought new hope. Men marked a new beginning, one which was not tied to the destiny that rang in the Song of Creation, but to bound to Him alone. As the Sun journeyed westward, most Men turned their eyes in- land and followed the beacon of the daystar. They went into the West through the great passes to the north and south of the Mountains of the Wind, taking countless tracks and trails through the forests, over the hills and across the grasslands of eastern Endor. Their tribes moved, multiplied, and settled, laying claim to Middle-earth. No Vala came to guide Men out of Hildorien, as did Orom\u00eb for the Eldar. The Powers never summoned the Secondborn to Valinor, for they were as yet unknowing, and Aman remained the domain of the undying. Instead, Men walked on their own. Henceforth most Men never knew of the real nature of the Valar, and never shared the close bond that bound the Eldar to the Lords of Aman. Just as Men were initially hidden from the Ainur, the Powers remained beyond the knowledge of the Secondborn, and those that encountered the hand of the Powers suspected their purpose and feared their presence. However, Ulmo cared for the Younger Children and sought to guide the counsel and understanding of his King, Manw\u00eb. The Ocean Lord also spoke to Men, conversing through the waters: in streams and floods and by the sea. Still, before the Secondborn met the Elves, they could hardly understand Ulmo's voice, or discern his impassioned message.The First Encounters with the Avari  It was inevitable, though, that Men would meet the Quendi, for the Elves lived throughout Middle-earth, and numerous groups of Avari (Q. \"Refusers\") resided in the East, Men marveled at the Firstborn, who looked much like themselves but possessed a fine culture and spoke with words rather than communicating by simple gestures. Although they initially shied away from the knowing Quendi, many of the Younger Children discovered and mastered speech, and some Men even befriended their teachers. Wild Men, on the other hand, shunned the Firstborn and made war on their brethren. Morgoth seduced many of their tribes, since fear and superstition guided their ways. Of those who did develop a friendship with the Elves, most de- vised their own cultures and founded their own realms. Some began to use their new-found knowledge to exploit or subjugate less fortunate peoples; such is the way with Men. Others learned of the tales of the Eldar and the Great Journey and resolved to trace the route of the three Elda kindreds. Their adventurous spirit led the way to the first sundering of the Secondborn.The First Sundering of Men  This split amongst the Hildor occurred between the Lintador and the Aravador: the \"swift\" groups who went into the Westlands and entered Beleriand, and the \"slow\" races who settled in other areas of Middle-earth or migrated into the West after the Elder Days. Among the Lintador, were the Edain, the Arhunedain (the ancient Easterlings) or (later) Arh\u00fbnerim, and the Dr\u00faedain (the Woses or Dr\u00fbgs). Aravador peoples included, among others, the Avarim (later Avaredain) or W\u00f4maw, the Harnerim (Southrons), the Mornerim (Snowmen), the Talatherim (Plainsmen or later [[Easterlings]), and the Linerim (eastern Lake-peoples). Led by the Edain, the Lintador traveled northwestward, across the wide grasslands, through Rh\u00fbn, and beyond the Anduin. Traveling apart and ahead of the others, the Edain reached Eriador after three centuries. For a time, they settled in the rich hills of what would later be Arnor. Then, after prospering near Nenuial, Balan took the First House of the Edain over the Blue Mountains (S. \"Ered Luin\") and into fair Beleriand.The Meeting of the Men and the Eldar  Balan's Edain entered Beleriand during the Long Peace that fol- lowed the third war between the Elves and Morgoth, the Glorious Battle (S. \"Dagor Aglareb\"). It was then that they encountered the Noldo King of Nargothrond, Finrod Felagund. Finrod became the first of the Eldar to behold the Younger Children of Eru. He befriended and taught these Men, who were of the First House of the Edain; and he developed a special rapport with their leader, the great Chieftain Balan, who was later called B\u00ebor the Old.The Three Houses of the Edain  Of the Edain or Atani, the Second-born \"Elf-friends,\" there were three great families. The First House comprised the people of Balan, later called B\u00ebor. The Second House was called the Halethrim, and they differed in speech and life from the House of B\u00ebor. Yet, they waited in the valleys on the eastern slopes for Balan's couriers to send them word concerning what they would find west of Ered Luin. A year passed before they followed their brethren over the mountains. The Third House counted the greatest numbers of the three Adan Kindreds, clans who paid homage to a mighty Chieftain called Marach of House Hador. Though the Third House had begun the journey westward before the House of Balan, their numbers had slowed them, for they were careful to stay together. They arrived in Beleriand two years after the first meeting of the Eldar and the Edain. Together, the Men of the Three Houses were called Atani (sing. \"Atan\"), the \"Second People,\" in the lore of Valinor. The Sindar of Beleriand named them by their own tongue, calling them the Edain (sing. \"Adan\"), and that name only speaks of Men whose blood comes from the three Kindreds of the Elf-friends.The End of the First Age  In the years that followed, many young and eager Edain took up service in the armies of the Elda Kings. Adan sympathies aligned against Morgoth, providing the Black Enemy with a new and vig- orous adversary. Although individually weak by Elda standards, Men fought hard and many \u2014 like Barahir, Beren Ercharmion, Huor of Dor-l\u00f3min, H\u00farin Thalion, Tuor Eladar, and T\u00farin Turambar \u2014 distinguished themselves as great heroes. The Edain were not the only Men to enter Beleriand, however. A small group of Woses, or Dr\u00faedain, lived among the people of the Second House. They remained apart from the fighting that raged across Beleriand; but, the two huge tribes of the Swarthy Easterlings, or Arh\u00fbnedain, that arrived soon afterwards, became embroiled in the struggle. Most enlisted in the armies of Morgoth, and were known thereafter as the Arh\u00fbnerim. B\u00f3r the Faithful's valiant Clan was the only exception, for they chose to ally with the Eldar and fought on behalf of the Free Peoples. During the dark days that concluded the First Age, the three Houses of the Edain suffered dearly. Some, like the thousand members of the First House led by Bereg the Refuser, simply left Beleriand; others perished in the fighting or struggled to survive in the wilds. The Easterlings were virtually annihilated in the Fifth Battle, the last conflict before the climactic War of Wrath. The War of Wrath, or Final Battle, ended the First Age. Morgoth was overthrown by the Host of the Valar and Arda was changed. Except for Lindon, all of Beleriand perished beneath the Great Sea. Out of the awful turmoil, the Elder Days passed and the Dark Years began.The Second Age  The uncertain years of the Second Age saw a gradual change in the character of Middle-earth. Although many Elves, including a large number of Eldar, resided in Endor, Men began to assert themselves. Most remained ignorant and worked hard to survive, of course, but others prospered. Of these, the Edain enjoyed the greatest glory. Settling N\u00famenor (aka Westernesse or Andor) \u2014 the island continent that the Valar created in the midst of the Great Sea west of Middle-earth \u2014 the majority of the Edain developed a brilliant culture which was largely based on Elda teachings. They became known as the N\u00famenoreans or the D\u00fanedain, the Edain of the West. In time, they sailed eastward to Endor, bringing their knowledge back to their brethren who lived near the shores. Just before the first D\u00fanadan ships dropped anchor off the coasts of Middle-earth, a new Power began to stir. Sauron, Morgoth's lieutenant, began to take shape again and over the course of the latter half of the first millenium S.A. returned to Endor. Around S.A. 1000, he occupied Mordor and began work on the Dark Tower. He then began laying plans for the conquest of the continent. While no Men in Middle-earth possessed the knowledge and strength to defeat the Dark Lord, the Men of Westernesse chal- lenged his rise. As the N\u00famenoreans power grew they began to exploit their less blessed brethren. They built a great empire and colonized much of Endor; they made war on many peoples. As their might grew, their ambitions followed and, like Sauron, the Lords of N\u00famenor began to style themselves as the Kings of Men. Sauron forged the One Ring around S.A. 1600, and captured the souls of nine mortal Men during the centuries that followed. They became his undying Ringwraiths, his most heinous servants. Three were fallen N\u00famenoreans, an indication of the relative might of the D\u00fanedain. Indeed, Sauron perceived the Edain of N\u00famenor as his greatest threat, for their expansion forced him to yield the coastal regions of Middle-earth to their hegemony. N\u00famenorean influence along the shores was preeminent. The Lord of the Rings fought the D\u00fanedain three times over the course of the Second Age.  N\u00famenorean intervention forced his defeat in his War Against the Elves (S.A. 1693-1700). Then, in S.A. 3262, he was forced to surrender before the might of Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n. He was bound and taken to the Blessed Isle as a prisoner. Sauron's capitulation signaled the beginning of the end of N\u00famenor. Already corrupt, the D\u00fanedain of Westernesse quickly fell under the Dark Lord's influence. He played on their fears of death and convinced Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n to attempt the conquest of the Undying Lands of Aman. Seeking immortality, the N\u00famenoreans built the Great Armament, all the time believing that the mere pos- session of Aman conferred undying life. Their greed, hybris, and lack of faith doomed their Kingdom. As they set foot in the Undying Lands in S.A. 3319, the Valar laid down their Guardian- ship and called upon Eru to rebalance Arda. The One created a cataclysm and the Great Sea swallowed Numenor. Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n and his invasion army were engulfed and destroyed. Aside from Sauron, the Faithful Elf-friends were the only sur- vivors of N\u00famenor's Downfall (A. \"Akallab\u00eath\"). Sailing back to Middle-earth, they founded the Kingdoms in Exile: Arnor and Gondor. These D\u00fanadan realms, although modest by N\u00famen\u00f3rean standards, proved to be the greatest Mannish Kingdoms in Endor. As a result, they quickly came in conflict with the Dark Lord. The third struggle between Sauron and the Dunedain ended the Second Age. Allying with the Eldar of Middle-earth, the D\u00fanedain of Arnor and Gondor forged the Last Alliance of Elves and Men and vanquished the Evil One in a war which cost Sauron the One Ring. The Alliance lost both its leaders, but the Evil One was forced out of Endor.The Third Age  The dawn of the Third Age saw Men freed from the yoke of N\u00famenorean domination and absolved of the Shadow spawned by the Lord of the Rings. Although still ignorant, they were free, and Mannish societies began to assert themselves more independently. They built new realms and expanded their holdings, warring amongst themselves. There was a mixing of races, reducing old distinctions and creating others. As a result, the Third Age saw a great decline in the presence of non-Mannish races in Middle-earth. The Eldar departed in unpre- cented numbers, while the Dwarves hid themselves or became nomadic folk. Hobbits migrated westward into the Shire of Eriador, finding comfort in their innocuous domain. The D\u00fanedain continued their preeminence among Men. The sons of Isildur Elendilion ruled the Northern Kingdom of Arnor, while the sons of Isildur's brother, An\u00e1rion Elendilion, ruled the Southern Kingdom of Gondor. In the East and South, successors to the old Numenorean overlords carved out their own kingdoms, dominating so-called lesser Men. Other Men, scattered throughout the world, appeared from the  heart of the continent, the region once ruled by Sauron. Having had little or no exposure to the D\u00fanedain in Ages past, the Balchoth, Wainriders, and other Easterlings came from beyond the [[Sea of Rh\u00fbn]] to confront Gondor. Others came from the South, among them Haradrim, Black N\u00famen\u00f3reans, and the Variags of Khand (who were accounted the most vicious Men in the world). But the D\u00fanedain remained strong and defeated all of their enemies. Not all Men warred against the Dunedain. Hiding in the forests, reclusive and shy, were the Woses \u2014 the Dr\u00faedain of old. These mystical, inscrutible, and strange people were capable of remark- able feats of hiding, nature lore, and magic, but they were overall very primitive in tongue and habit. These were shy but hardy folk, exceptionally hospitible to strangers. But they were not quick to form close bonds, and they remained increasingly hesitant about entering into the affairs of others. In the grasslands and plateau country of south-central Endor dwelt more peaceable Horseman tribes: the Chey and the Ahar peoples. Their ancestors were the Talatherim (Plainsmen or later Easterlings) of the First and Second Ages, the same kindred who gave birth to their neighbors to the south, the surprisingly civilized mercantile races like the Shay and Chy. Many of their cities were early colonies of N\u00famenor, port and crossroad towns that formed the foundation for the nations of the Bulchyades, Clyan, Olyas Kriis, and Codya.  In the Farthest South dwelt the myriad peoples of the M\u00fbmakan main, many of whom suffered in the struggle between Sauron, the Numendreans, and cults loyal to Morgoth's ancient legacy. Most descended from the Harnerim (Southron), folk that produced the Haradrim and contributed to the blood of the Variags. They included the tall, graceful Kirani, the Tuktani, and the violent M\u00fbmakanril. Others, like the Hathorians, were alien cultures that had arrived with the Men of N\u00famenor. Descendants of the Avarim or Avaredain, the Womaw, domi- nated much of the Farthest East. They had been heavily influenced by the Avari and, like the Edain, were counted as Elf-friends (albeit by the Dark Elves). From the homeland in northeast Endor, these seafaring folk extended their domain throughout isles and along the coasts washed by the waters of the Encircling Sea. Linerim, the Lake-peoples, resided to their west, along the inland flanks of the great mountain ranges of the East. Northrons lived in the Far North. The offspring of the ancient kindred of the Mornerim, many of whom had died in Morgoth's Wars, they remained very distinct and quite apart from other Men. They counted, among other peoples, the Lossoth of Forochel. Their scattered, nomadic clans ruled the icy wastes, an example of how Men came to occupy the whole of Middle-earth. Indeed, by the beginning of the Third Age, they were but one of hundreds of Mannish communities, both Common Men and those derived from the early fathers of the Elf-friends, that scattered to the four corners of Endor.The Struggle Against Sauron  With the rise of Sauron in the middle of the Third Age, most of these peoples would struggle under the Shadow, Many succumbed to their own weaknesses \u2014 fear, greed, superstition, or pride \u2014 while others resisted and were conquered by force of arms. Clever plots and overt force brought the majority of Middle-earth under the rule of the Lord of the Rings. His Nazg\u00fbl, the nine undead Mannish Kings who acted as his most powerful agents, carved the continent into their own fiefs. One such Evil arose far in the North. Sauron's great lieutenant, the first of the Nazg\u00fbl, grew in power in the lean and frigid lands of Angmar. He built an evil army of Orcs and creatures, the Ettenmoor Hillmen, and far-travelled Easterlings. With these hordes he warred on Arnor, laying waste to the D\u00fanadan Kingdom. Although Angmar itself was finally broken, only a remnant of the northern D\u00fanedain\u2014the noble Rangers of the North\u2014remained to oppose the Evil One's will. The southern D\u00fanedain, the Men of Gondor, appeared alone in their struggle against the Dark Lord. As the Witch-king worked in the North a constant flow of evil Barbarians swept from the South and East against Gondor. Again there were Haradrim, Easterlings, and Variags; and to their num- bers were added the Dunlendings. The Nazg\u00fbl came forth from Mordor and seized the great tower of Minas Ithil from the Gondori- ans. The wondrous citadel-city that stood guard over Mordor was renamed Minas Morg\u00fbl, the Tower of Black Sorcery. Against this swelling threat, though, Gondor found new allies. The Rohirrim of Rohan, the Woodmen of Rhovanion and Beornings of Mirkwood, the Bardings of Dale, all came to the D\u00fanedain's aid to fight back the evil tide sweeping their lands. This was the setting for the War of the Ring, where Sauron with all hismight attempted to wrest the Ring of Power from the Hobbits of the Shire, who by their innocence and courage eventually destroyed it The Istar (Wizard) Gandalf paved the way for the Free Peoples' victory, removing many foes. The One King, hidden for centuries from Sauron's machinations, was revealed and he pre- vailed against the Dark Armies. Sauron and his Empire of the Shadow were destroyed, marking the end of the Third Age.The Fourth Age, the Age of Men  The return of the King brought Aragorn Elessar , son of Arathorn II to the throne of both Gondor and Arnor. Named Elessar, he was the true heir of Isildur, and the King of all the D\u00fanedain. He made the final union of the royal Mannish blood and the Elvish, for he married Arwen Und\u00f3miel, the daughter of Elrond Half-elven. They ruled together until Fourth Age 120, when he died, old and full of years. King Elessar, by wisdom and strength, made peace with the Eas- terlings and the Haradrim, and under his hand began the Fourth Age: The Time of the Dominion of Men. The D\u00fanedain had drawn from the Elves that which was truly noble and great: love, beauty. knowledge and lore. They passed it on to their descendants. But their victory over the Dark Years had been foreseen by Eru and He had indeed made them with that design. In purpose they were to be His and His alone. In form they were to be the ones who could endure; over whom Destiny could not make absolute claim; in whom ran the cycles of life; for whom was promised the joy and hope of eternity with Eru. Even the Valar are awed and now sing of the gifts given by the Father to Men.Names The Lintador (men who wandered into the west) The Aravador (men who stayed in the east) References: the mannish peoples in other adaptions Lotro  The Lord of the Rings Online, set in 3019 mentions some new mannish groups: http://merp.wikia.com/wiki/Middle-earth_Role_Playing_Wiki Other groups that also accur in the books are the breelanders, the chief\u00b4s men, the d\u00fanedain, dunlendings and (normal) hillmen.Mannish Groups in Inc\u00e1nus Middle-Earth conversion  Berislav \u201cInc\u00e1nus\u201d Lopac presents a view on middle-earth on his homepage that is somewhat different from the MERP-canon.Link: Rh\u00fbn  The Term Rh\u00fbn was a vague term which could either refer to Eastern Middle-Earth as a whole (then usually called \"Rh\u00fbn the Great\"), the vast plains of Central Middle-earth or in a closer sense to the former gondorian province of Near-Rh\u00fbn, the lands surrounding the famous Inland Sea of Rh\u00fbn.See MERP  the category MERP is for all articles belonging to the MERP canon.Orcs  The Orcs (B.S.: Uruku; Q.: Orcor; S.: Yrch) were a warlike tribal race which dwelt in the Westlands of Middle-earth and other territories of Arda. Tales of their origins varied, though most accounts agreed that the fallen Vala Melkor had some hand in their creation. Indeed, the disparate tribes all worshiped him as a deity and the Orcs were also known as the Children of Melkor. Orc society was rigidly divided into two castes - a slave caste composed of common Orcs (or Snaga, pl. Snagai) and a warrior caste (or Uruk, pl. Uruki) composed of the socially privileged and physically strong. The appearance of Orcs varied considerably depending on their region of habitation, culture and caste, though most had sallow skin and were between three and six foot in height.History Origins  It was speculated in the Quenta Silmarillion that the Orcs were created by the fallen Vala Morgoth (originally known as Melkor) in The Great Darkness of the Elder Days by capturing and corrupting wild Elven kindreds who had refused to make the Great Journey westward. It is said that these Elves fled in terror at the sight of the Vala Orom\u00eb when he came to lead them from Cuivi\u00e9nen, the birthplace of the Elven race, to the sanctuary of Valinor. Orcs were widely believed to be the descendants of these corrupted Avari Elves, who became isolated from their kin and remained ignorant of the true deities of Arda, the Valar. They were therefore easily ensnared by the the Dark Lord, who made thralls of them. It was also proposed in the Quenta Silmarillion that the Orcs were originally a kindred of Avari who had become hardened and savage due to long exposure to the inhospitable, untamed lands of Middle-earth. An older theory had it that the Orcs were bred by Morgoth \"from the heats and slimes of the earth\" and imbued with life through his sorcery. This theory was later disregarded, as the deity Il\u00favatar was thought to be the only being capable of independently creating life. Some regarded Orcs as being descended from Men who fell under the influence of Morgoth, in particular the tribal Dr\u00faedain or Dr\u00fbgs. This theory, however, was most often propounded by those unfriendly to the Dr\u00faedain and those ignorant of their culture. The Elves, by contrast, affirmed the claim that Orcs were made from men, but not directly from the Dr\u00faedain, explaining that the Dr\u00faedain must have escaped the shadow of Morgoth, \"for their laughter and the laughter of Orcs are as different as the light of Aman from the darkness of Angband\". Further, the Orcs and the Dr\u00faedain each regarded the other as renegades, which may imply distant kinship, perhaps sharing the same ancestors, and thus they viewed each other as straying from the ways they were supposed to adhere to, but the Dr\u00faedain themselves are by no means likely to be the ancestors of Orcs, simply perhaps their distant cousins. Others held that Orcs were the result of interbreeding between corrupt Men and fallen Avari.First Age  In the Quenta Silmarillion, it is said that the renegade deity Morgoth subsided in a great fortress in the northernmost reaches of Middle-earth, until it was sacked by the Powers of the Arda at the end of the First Age of the Stars. Morgoth was then imprisoned with a great chain, and in the violence of this battle his creations, the Orcs, were scattered across the world.The Wars of Beleriand  No mention is again made of the Orcs in Elven texts until the Fourth Age of the Stars, when the Elves of Beleriand were overwhelmed by them and forced to seek the aid of their Dwarven allies in forging weapons. Equipped with Dwarven steel, the Elves defeated the invading hosts of Orcs, but in the Last Age of the Stars legions upon legions would issue from the Gates of Angband to assault the allied Elves and Dwarves. The Sindar and the Laiquendi, led by Thingol and Denethor, decimated the first of the three great Orc armies, the remnants being dispatched by the Dwarves. When the second army of Orcs failed to conquer the cities of the Falas, they joined forces with the third army in an attempt to ambush the Noldor, newly arrived in Mithrim. Led by F\u00ebanor the Great, these powerful High Elves slaughtered their Orc assailants in great numbers and pursued them through Eredwethion into the plains of Bladorion. It is even said that the light of Valinor which shone in their eyes seared the flesh of the fleeing Orcs. This battle is known as the Second Battle in the Wars of Beleriand, or the Battle Under the Stars (Dagor-os-Giliath), as it took place between the diminishing of the light of the Two Trees of Valinor and the first rising of the Sun and Moon. It was in this battle that F\u00ebanor was slain by a host of Balrogs and met his end at the hand of their lord, Gothmog. A second army of Noldor, led by Fingolfin, arrived soon after the defeat of F\u00ebanor. As their arrival was concurrent with the first rising on the Sun and Moon, they were greatly feared by the Orcs and many fled at their arrival into the depths of the earth. F\u00ebanor's son, Maedhros, then formed an uneasy alliance with Fingolfin, and soon the Orcs were driven into Bladorion, encircled and utterly decimated in the Glorious Battle (or Dagor Aglareb). The remaining Orcs were penned against the walls of Angband by the encircling Elves in a siege which lasted over 400 years. During this time, some Orcs did attempt the perilous journey through the snowy north. One such group arrived at the coast west of Eredlomin but were discovered by the vigilant Elves and driven into the sea near Drengist. Within the walls of Angband, however, Morgoth began to secretly replenish his forces, breeding Dragons, Balrogs, Werewolves, Trolls and vast numbers of Orcs. In the Battle of Sudden Flame, the Dagor Bragollach, and the Battle of Unnumbered Tears, the strength of Elves and their allies, the Edain, was broken.The War of Wrath  Few tales survive of this era, though it is known that Morgoth succeeded in bringing both Elves and Men under his power and was on the brink of total victory in Arda.Culture and Society Culture  Orc society was divided into two large castes: the smaller, more numerous slave caste (or Snaga, pl. Snagae) and the larger, less numerous warrior caste (or Uruk, pl. Uruku). Although there was some regional variation in the culture of Orc tribes, this hierarchical pattern was consistent to them all. For example, a northern tribe, known as the Hiisiis, who were quite isolated from their southerly dwelling kin, were also divided into greater and lesser Orcs. Even the secretive Fel, who resided in the distant deserts of Far-Harad, divided themselves in this way. Young Orcs, referred to as \"imps\", were raised jointly by older females who were no longer capable of bearing children. Orcs were divided into one of the two castes at birth. The young Snagae subsisted within large, overcrowded \"breeding pits\", where craftiness, cunning and brute force alone assured a young Orc's survival. The considerably stronger Uruku were raised apart from the Snagae, which they would undoubtedly have slaughtered had they been raised together. The Uruku would then be educated in their superiority over the Snagae and trained to occupy the roles of officers, priests and healers or bodyguards (Hoerk) of their Orc lord. A young Orc's upbringing emphasised the values of strength, aggressiveness, combat and heavy labour over and above more peaceful or nurturing values. The weakest of imps would be consumed by the stronger, which Orcs regarded as a way of relieving the community of \"unnecessary burdens\". When a young male Orc reached the age of full maturity at nine years old, he was assigned to a regiment, or lurg, composed of ten to fifteen Orcs. Though most were relegated to general purpose lurgs (responsible for hunting, foraging, mining, or raiding as required), those who displayed a special aptitude in certain fields at an early age were assigned to more specialized lurgs. Among some clans there were castes of hunters (Gajutar), herdsmen (Grauga), chanters (Kangtar) and miners (Garmog). Some of the more civilized tribes even maintained a class of learned scribes and scholars, the Lamoshgongs. There also existed a small bloodline of Orcish sorcerers and sorceresses, the Dushi. Some tribes included a small caste of masterful craftsmen, organised within the Nazg-artha. Of this caste, smiths (or T\u00fbt\u00fbli) were especially prized, as were engineers (or Zongoti). The distinction between Uruk and Snaga should not, however, be confused with the distinction between Orcs in general and the Uruk-Hai of the late Third Age, which were bred and trained by the rulers of Mordor and Isengard with the purpose of conquering the Westlands. These Uruk-Hai, who first revealed themselves to the world with their assault on Ithilien in T.A. 2475, were believed to have all been destroyed by the time the War of the Ring had ended, while the common Orcs fled eastward or continued to dwell in secret beneath the Misty Mountains.Society  Orcs lived in tribes, called Hai in Orcish. While some tribes had a strict militaristic hierarchy, others suffered from constant inner strife and chaos. Orcish tribes and clans were ruled by the strongest males and weaker members of the tribe were held as slaves. From early childhood on, male Orcs were favored above female Orcs, who were reduced to the status of mere chattel. Gender roles were rigidly defined within Orcish society, with common female Orcs working exclusively within the confines of the tribe's territory, performing domestic duties such as weaving, preparing meals, mushroom-harvesting and child-rearing. Female Orcs were generally not trained in the use of arms. Females of the Uruk caste, on the other hand, enjoyed certain privileges, though they were still poorly treated in comparison with male Uruku. As a concubine of a powerful Orc lord, an Uruk female could enjoy some status and even exercise considerable influence through manipulation. Stronger females occasionally rose to higher ranks, even to second-in-command. This was not the fated structure of all Orc tribes, however. Matriarchal tribes were also known to exist. In such tribes, the \"breeding pits\" associated with patriarchal tribes were replaced with male dormitories and males added child care to their list of duties, which also included hunting and raiding. The females occupied private chambers and engaged in all the activities usually reserved to males in patriarchal tribes. In either arrangement, paternal or maternal feelings were almost non-existent. Females would only nurse young Orcs because the suckling of their toothy jaws relieved the pain associated with swollen mammaries, while male Orcs would perform parental duties only when compelled by higher-ups or when it was acknowledged to be in the collective interest of the Hai. Snagae did not labour for pay or pleasure, but solely at the compulsion of their rulers, who would reward them with only the resources necessary to sustain them in their toil. In spite of this exploitative slave system, the Orcs were nonetheless capable of producing superior, if not especially beautiful, goods and weapons. Though not rewarded for good work, Snagae were severely punished for shoddy work. Within Orcish society, material well-being was a direct function of rank. Looting was the main source of Orcish currency and treasure, and was distributed based on status; the majority of the treasure going to upper caste and the leavings given to the lower caste. Every Orc was entitled to a ration of food, clothing, and in the case of males, weapons and armor, though quality and quantity varied with social status. With what resources or currency a common Orc had, he or she could barter for meager pleasures, such as liquor. The upper caste enjoyed a much more varied range of pleasures, including superior drink, fine garments and herbal drugs. Some tribes would gather large mushrooms, plants and fish in subterranean rivers and lakes, but most tribes herded animals such as pigs (B\u00fbb), Orcish Kine and Black goats (Dagri). Orcs did not typically engage in agriculture, though a few tribes held plantations (Kuflags) tilled by foreign slaves. These non-Orc slaves held the lowest social position within the tribe and were often abused by even the lowliest Orc. Typically these slaves were clad in rags and lived on a subsistence diet. Although both Uruk and common Orc were entitled to care if injured, these non-Orc slaves were usually abandoned. Orc lords or chieftains surrounded themselves with loyal captains, lieutenants and sergeants who led the lesser groups. Orcish chieftains, princes and lords used titles which varied from tribe to tribe, such as Af\u00fbkhaush, Durub, Durba, D\u00fbrohtar, Fha-Korlash, Goth, Great Goblin, Shakh and Zot. Greater Kings or High Kings seldom emerged and were usually no more than warlords who ruled for a brief time, although some succeeded in preserving the power of their bloodline over several generations. Such High Kings were known as Ashdurbuk or Gothsnaga. Lesser commanders, lieutenants, leaders, sergeants or small chiefs were variously called Drartul, Gottul, Hrizgthrak\u00ee, Krir, Kritar, Rroshatar, Slasher, Shir\u00fbk or Uj\u00e2k. Soldiers were known as Dogi, Daugi, Kragashi, Nadaki or Ushatar.Orcs and other Races  Orcs were virtually outlawed by any other culture, especially the Quendi and the Dr\u00fbghu but also most Dwarves and Men of the West. However, many Haradrim and Easterlings and even some Western Men as the Dunlendings, Hillmen and Angmarrim fought and lived side by side with Orcs, so both races had long periods of times where they virtually coexisted and Orcs walked more or less freely in Mannish territory and settlements. But still most Men of Darkness either disdained or feared the Orcs and there was never much true friendship and real trust between both races.Languages Orcish  Orcish was a collection of guttural tribal dialects spoken among the Orcs. There was great linguistic and grammatical variance between Orcish tongues and many of them were mutually unintelligible. Because of this, most Orc tribes used Westron as a lingua franca.Westron  A heavily accented, guttural version of Westron was used by many Orcish tribes as a trade language. The Orcish inhabitants of Gundabad and the Misty Mountains adopted Westron as their native tongue.Black Speech  The Black Speech was a language devised by Sauron during the Dark Years to be the sole language of the servants of Mordor, replacing the many different varieties of Orcish and other languages.Melkorin  Melkorin was an ancient language which influenced both the many Orcish tongues and the Black Speech of Mordor.Physiology and Biology Appearance  Orcish appearance could vary greatly between the different Castes, Tribes, Breeds and even one single clan however the typical Orc was always described as squat, stout, square and generally at least a bit shorter than the average man.They were depicted as dark, swarthy, swart ,sallow, black or grey-skinned, had slant, catlike eyes red, green or yellowish in color, dark hair, hairy ears, wide mouths, flat noses, claws and fangs like beasts of prey.Some of the Men of the Westlandss felt that Orcs resembled degraded and repulsive versions of the (to Men of the West) least lovely types of the Men of the East.Intelligence  Orcs were said to have been clever and competent craftsmen, miners and engineers, though they turned this intelligence largely toward the production of machines of war. Some innovations in weaponry are attributed to Orcish designs, as \"wheels and engines and explosions\" were said to have \"always delighted them\". Their mining techniques were also said to rival all but the most competent of Dwarves. Yet there were some who regarded them as being no more than beasts of humanized shape, deliberately designed by the Vala Morgoth to mock the form of Men and Elves. Even their speech, it was claimed, was in imitation of intelligent peoples, much like a parrot speaks in imitation of its master and should not be taken as indicative of intelligence. This theory, however, contradicts much of what is known of Orcish origins and should not be taken as fact or an accurate reflection on the intelligence of Orcs.Height  Orc height varied considerably depending on breed and tribe, with some particularly large Orcs being as tall as the average adult Man and others being below three foot. The average Orc height was generally between three and six feet tall.Strengths and Weaknesses  Orcs were intolerant of sunlight and traveled by night so as to avoid it, some Orcs were only weakened and slowed down by the Sun, but others could pass out or even turn blind if suddenly exposed to sunlight. Only breeds which emerged in the late Third Age showed greater tolerance for the rays of the sun although they still despised it. Orcs otherwise showed tremendous endurance, needing to rest but once every three days if necessary. Orcs were also highly resistant to the extremes of heat and cold, and could function in nearly any climate, allowing them to make their habitations in even the most desolate of settings. Orcs also possessed superior night-vision, capable of seeing in starlight what other races could only perceive during the light of day. Orcs were even capable of discerning shapes in absolute darkness. In daylight, by contrast, Orc eyesight was seriously impaired, leaving the Orcs confused and disoriented. An Orc could compensate for this disadvantage by using their heightened sense of smell. With proper training, an Orc could even track by scent alone.Diet  Orcs were said to have been constantly hungry. They frequently consumed the flesh and blood of their enemies and that of traitors, though it may have been taboo to consume the flesh of allied fellow Orcs.Lifespan  The average lifespan of Orcs is uncertain, though the chieftain Bolg, son of Azog, was approximately 150 years old, suggesting that, like Dwarves, Orcs may have been able to live extremely long lives. If Orcs were the descendants of Elves, as the Quenta Silmarillion suggested, it is also possible that they were immortal and may even have been capable of reincarnation. However, due to the constant in-fighting which prevailed among Orcish tribes, the lifespan of the average Orc often proved to be considerably shorter than that of other peoples. Although it is certain that some Orcs led extremely long lives, most would meet their end in the rebellious, combative social structure of Orc tribes.It was also stated that common or lesser Orcs had short lifespans in comparison to common Men.Reproduction  It was stated in the Quenta Silmarillion that Orcs \"multiplied after the manner of the Children of Il\u00favatar\". Unlike the other peoples of Middle-earth, Orcs did not marry, they simply bred. Orcish females of child-bearing age were kept together in a secluded area of the Orcish domain, guarded and accessible only to the stronger males. Foreigners were never permitted to see the female Orcs, explaining their general absence from historical accounts and even suspicion among other races as to whether or not female Orcs existed at all. Some Orc females were kept as part of harems and would procreate exclusively with the warrior caste. Others were kept as the personal possessions of Orc lords, as an emblem of their power. Although these practices were undoubtedly cruel and inhumane, it did allow Orcs to reproduce at a startlingly greater rate than the other peoples of Arda. Orc pregnancies lasted less than five months, quadruplets were common and male births were twice as common as female births. Orc females were also capable of twice as many conceptions as human females. This meant that Orc tribes could replenish their numbers within a few generations, even if the majority of the tribe had been decimated in battle, provided the females remained unharmed. Throughout their history, Orcs interbred with competing groups and different Orc strains. Orcs who were the result of interbreeding between lesser Orcs and the Uruk-Hai were known as Gusm\u00fbras, while those who had Mannish blood were known simply as Half-Orcs. While in the service of Morgoth, Sauron and Saruman, Orcs were the subject of numerous breeding experiments. For example, although Orcs were not naturally adept at wielding sorcery, Sauron attempted to breed a race of Orc mages. These sorcerer Orcs were regarded as Uruk or Snaga on an individual basis, as they were not strictly born into either caste.Final destiny  It is unknown what eventually later happened to the Orcs after Sauron's Fall.This is for large parts due to their uncertain origin.Orcs of maiarin descent would likely continue to exist as lesser Demons, but not multiply again in large numbers, Orcs of elvish origin would eventually start to fade, just like the remaining avari and turn into spirit-like lesser Goblins like the goblins of actual folk-lore and again possibly not multiply again, Orcs of mannish descent might actually re-generate and turn into primitive, but not necessary evil or monstrous men and Orcs of bestial descent would degenerate into lesser and of course soulless beasts, nasty but not as dangerous as their earlier progenitors.Elf-Orcs and man-Orcs also would have,at last in theory, a free will and without being dominated by a greater evil power could eventually become harmless and perhaps would alternate to a state more similar to the early elves and men their ancestors had once been and then either fade like Avari (Indeed Tolkien discusses the possibility of dead Orcs becoming Poltergeists) or adapt again to common men and merge with them (There is the idea that all later men had some sort of orcish \"strain\", and Tolkien once stated allegorical \"We were all Orcs in the War\") .By the Lifetime of Berelach in the early Fourth Age, Orcs had already become largely the focus of fairy tales, indicating they were uncommon, at least to the civilized regions such as Gondor. However the mention of annoying acts performed by goblins in later Ages (as is hinted at in The Hobbit- or There and Back again) and the re-appearance of Orcs in the Dagor Dagorath at the end of days suggests that at least demonic or beast-like Orcs continued to exist in one way or another. See:Faith and Worship  Orcs held the Vala Morgoth in fear and reverence as their creator and ruler. Morgoth's capacity to induce terror was considered a highly worshipful quality among the warlike Orcs. The Maia Sauron, too, was worshiped as a deity by the Orcish tribes in the Second Age and the late Third Age, much as he was revered as a prophet by the inhabitants of N\u00famenor in the Second Age. Yet religious feeling among Orcs took on a very different character than that found among the other peoples of Arda. Orcs universally feared and reviled the object of their worship, regarding him as a great tyrant to be placated with sacrifices and offerings. It is also likely that the Orcs believed the godhead Il\u00favatar to be a fiction devised by the Valar to keep them in chains - a belief that was also held by the Men of N\u00famenor before the catastrophes recounted in the Akallab\u00eath buried their island homeland beneath the sea. In Gundabad there existed an ancient priesthood whose duty it was to placate the Dark Lord by conducting rituals, maintaining tribal records, chanting, human sacrifice and the burning of pyres. However, Orc faiths made no claims of an afterlife. The bodies of common Orcs were typically disposed of without ceremony, while Uruku were entombed within ritually prepared crypts.Breeds and Tribes Breeds  A great number of physically distinct Orc breeds existed. see:Orc-KindTribes  A number of Orcish tribes are known to have dwelt in the Westlands and other regions of Arda.Etymology Northern and Western tongues Eastern and Southern tongues Other tongues  Orcs were also known by the names Gongai, Kap\u00fbl, Khobl\u00fan, Orkhor, Orog, Rakhash, Rakhsha,Ruk, R\u00fbkh, Rukh\u00e2s, Ruki, R\u00fbku, Tanarukk, Ur\u00fbk, among others.Other Media Rolemaster  Rolemaster and Loremaster (ICE Series) have a race corresponding to Orcs, the Murlogi who are ruled by the greater and more dangerous Lugroki, who are more similar to Orc-Demons or Boldogs, as well as the race of the Karku, with it's two sub-breeds the Garks and Krals, who are similar to Orcs or primitive ape-men but are said to be more closely related to both Men and Trolls.Orcs in The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game Breeds  The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game describes several breeds of Orcs. Orcs:Tribes Hall of Fire Magazine  The Hall of Fire Magazine proposed several additional sub-breeds of Orc for LotR RPG:Orcs in The Lord of the Rings Online  Some of the tribal names of Orcs in The Lord of the Rings Online are modeled after Orcish tribal names found in the Midde-Earth Roleplaying Game, for example Blogmal, Gh\u00e2sh-Hai and Ongb\u00farz. It seems likely that a millennium after the fall of Angmar most of the old tribes have diminished or been decimated in internal feuds and new tribal alliances grew out of these struggles. Another possibility is that agents of the Witch-King installed the great seven tribes of Angmar (Blogmal, Gh\u00e2sh-Hai, Kraiarn, Ongb\u00farz, Tarkr\u00eep, Gh\u00e2shfra, Hontimurz) to establish a formal rule among the many disparate Orc clans of the north. On the other hand, the three main tribes of Moria seem to have fallen apart and their realm turned to the anarchy of constantly emerging and fading small groups. The existing tribes (Durub, Gazathrug, Highpeak, Largzurm, P\u00fblpum) are just small alliances that have shortly appeared, perhaps during the reigns of Durburz and Mazog, and will probably fall apart soon. Finally the newer tribes of Mirkwood (Burzthr\u00e2ng, Dushmau, Fr\u00fbmhon, Hishtgropor, Maukglob) may be lesser known subdivisions of the Guldur Orcs or newer tribal alliances established after the second rise of Dol Guldur.Breeds  There are four main breeds of Orc in The Lord of the Rings Online:Tribes  The Lord of the Rings Online features several Orc tribes, such as:Orcs in Middle-Earth: Shadow of War  Shadow of war features nine different tribes or Mordor-Orcs, each representing a different facet of orcish culture:Orcs in The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game  In The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game there are several Orc breeds that also make appearances in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings film series: the Moria Goblins, Mordor Orcs and the larger Morannon Orcs, as well as Isengard Uruk-Hai and Mordor Uruk-Hai. However there are also several additional breeds, such as the Orc Trackers mentioned in J.R.R. Tolkien's novels, larger Goblins or Hobgoblins (Durburz, Golfimbul and Groblog) and the Morg\u00fbl Stalkers, assassin Orcs with wraith-like qualities. Some special Orc characters were invented for the game, such as Ashrak, Druzhag, Durburz, Groblog, Kardush and Vrasku.Orcs in The Battle for Middle-Earth  In The Battle for Middle-Earth series there are a number of Orc breeds, most of which also appear in the film trilogy: Orcish workers or slave Orcs of Mordor and Isengard, lesser Mordor Orcs and greater Black Orcs (or Morannon Orcs), Uruk-Hai and Moria Goblins. In Rise of the Witch-King the Gundabad Orcs are shown as an archaic Orc breed similar or identical to the Orcs shown in the film trilogy's introduction. There are several Orc characters who were invented for the game: Gorkil, Krashnak and Thrugg.Orcs in The Lord of the Rings Film Adaptations  The film adaptations depict several different Orc races and tribes, including the Uruk-Hai and Snaga of Mordor and Isengard, the Moria Goblins, Morannon Orcs, Orcish trackers of Mordor, the Goblins of Goblin-Gate, Hunter-Orcs and Gundabad Orcs.Orcs in Fan-Fiction and Live-Action Roleplaying  Some Fan-Fiction and Live-Action Roleplaying backgrounds have given original names to the different Orc breeds: However, this contradicts other sources. For example, The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game considers Orc Trackers and Forest-Orcs to be of the same race.Orc-Quotes References See also External links Easterlings  Easterlings (S.Rh\u00fanedain Q. R\u00f3menildi or Hr\u00f3natani) was a vague term for the wild tribes of eastern Middle-Earth. In the First Age the name was applied to the Peoples of Bor and Ulfang in Beleriand, the first ones who were faithful to the Eldar, the latter ones who were traitors and in secret allegiance with Morgoth became known as the \"Wolf-folk\". The surviving Easterlings fled back in their eastern homelands after the drowning of Beleriand and became rulers of the indigenous tribes, most of whom were their distant kinsmen, among these men were the original populace of the Lands surrounding the Rh\u00fbnaer but also men north of Eriador who possibly were the ancestors of the Lossoth and the Angmarrim. In the Second Age Kham\u00fbl was a fallen Easterling King who became a Nazg\u00fbl. In the Third Age the term Easterlings was used for the many tribes of Rh\u00fbn, maybe to some part relatives of the Easterlings of the first and second Ages. The original Easterlings of Rh\u00fbn were early enemies of Gondor who were defeated by R\u00f3mendacil I in 500 TA and finally conquered by Romendacil II in 1248 TA. But later new peoples arrived from the unknown eastern lands. At first the Wainriders, who were at war with Gondor between 1851 TA and 1944 TA; later the Balchoth who made war on Gondor in 2510 TA. At the Time of the war of the ring in 3019 TA a new unnamed people had arrived: small and stout men with long beards like dwarves who fought with great axes.History  In the First Age Easterlings were identified with the Arh\u00fbnerim, a group of wandering peoples which also included the Daen peoples.In Beleriand the Easterlings were also known as the Baradhrim or \"Swarthy men\", the treacherous faction of which became known as the Ulbarim. After the drowning of Beleriand the surviving Ulbarim and Baradrim fled to Rh\u00fbn where they subjugated related tribes, from these arose the Easterling peoples known as the Shrel and Vulzsev. The later Easterlings were identified with the Talatherim or Plainsmen, a large group of peoples in central middle-earth in the first Age which was part of the Aravador, the part of the Hildor which had stayed in the Wild Lands east and South in the first Age, although they might have been more closely akin to the Arh\u00fbnerim than the other Aravador splinter-factions. The Talatherim, by the second Age, had split into eight language-groups: the Ioriags (ancestors of the Variags and the Balchoth), the Ulgath (ancestors of the wainriders), the Tyr (a group of tribes in central middle-earth), the Chey (a group of tribes in south-central middle-earth), the Chy (a group of tribes in eastern Harad), the Shay (a group of tribes in southeastern Middle-earth),the Ahar (a group of tribes in eastern-central Middle-Earth) and the Ibav (also in southeastern middle-earth) (a possible ninth group may have been the fale in the utter east, who were also considered Easterlings). In the Far east, the Far north and the South-eastern Regions however many other less known groups and cultures prevailed, among them the more civilized Avaradan, the rather primitive Men of the Orocarni and Woodmen of the Far east, the coastal Braric-Hillfolk, the Eastern Lake-peoples the snow-dwelling Mornerim and peoples possibly related to the Black Men of the South as the J\u00f4pi, Ts'dan and similar tribes.Easterling Culture  Easterling Culture was as diverse as their tumultuous history.In the wide plains of central Middle-Earth the Talatherim prevailed whose culture was largely nomadic or semi-nomadic, while the Eastern Lake-peoples were more sedentary farmers.In the Far North Nomads, Fishermen and Hunters reigned the lands although smaller communities of settled fishermen, farmers and traders were not uncommon.In the farthest East farming and stock breeding were more common and the peoples close to the Romenaer were quite urban and civilized, but more primitive Herders and Hunter-Gatherer Tribes still existed in the Red Mountains and the Wild woods. The Men of the Southeast were divided into the nomadic Folk of the Great Plateau and the sedentary farmers and fishermen of the Coasts of the Inner Seas as well as the wild Woodmen.Easterling Language  The Easterlings spoke a large number of tribal dialects.Most of their languages were alien to the tongues of the Westlands, having been influenced to varying degrees by Khuzdul (Talatherin in central Middle-Earth]]), the Dragon-Speech (Avaradan in the Farthest East and southern Talatherin), Orcish and Melkian (in the Far North) and the Avarin tongues of the East-Elves (in the Farthest East and the Southeast). see: Easterling LanguagesEasterling Religion  The Easterlings had a number of different cults.Many mannish peoples had preserved memories from the First Age, legends about a Voice and a mighty Man, a first temple and various Spirits and Demons. Additionally, some early mannish tribes had been pupils of Avari and Orcs, and had learned rumors about the Powers of the West. This had led to some superstitious ideas and cults among the early Men, many of which prevailed among the Wild Men of the East. The Men of the East continued their own primitive spirit-worship and remnants of the old Dark Worship, but also added a kind of nature-worship, which included indistinct memories of the Entwives who had taught their forefathers agriculture and various magical cults and arcane traditions brought to the East and South by the Ithryn Luin. In the north, East and South of Eastern Middle-Earth however myriads of other local and superstitious cults existed, from primitive animistic reverence of local Nature-Spirits and the ancestors to various descendants of the Dark Cults and newer Idol-worshiping followers of the Dark Lord.A Genealogy of the Easterlings The Easterlings in the Lord of the Rings role-playing game  The Lord of the Rings role-playing game mentions an Easterling lord named Gartog, a noble character who grew up as a hostage at the gondorian court and who was a childhood friend of Denethor who still had vague hope his former friend could be convinced not to join Sauron's forces with his men.The Easterlings in LOTRO  The Lord of the Rings Online has several Easterling Tribes.Two and Jangovar of them, the Khundolar, are described as descendants of the Balchoth who are supported by a caste of blue Sorcerers,implied to be one of the strange cults founded by the Ithryn Luin.A Third clan, the S\u00fbhalar are identified with the Axe-Easterlings, briefly described in the Books.Two tribes which are not portrayed as hostile but as refugees from the eastern wars are the Dorwinions and Chayasir.The Easterlings in the Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle-Game  The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle-Game remains close to the easterlings depicted in the Lord of the rings movie trilogy, but adds a few details.The Easterlings are described as a unified Culture.There still are many Kings or Kingdoms but they have been forged into one single power by Sauron before he took the role of the Necromancer of Dol Guldur. The Easterlings of Rh\u00fbn are ruled by an elite-warrior order, the Dragon knights and war-priests. A prominent Easterling leader is Amd\u00fbr the Lord of Blades, head of the Dragon Knights. The Easterlings of Rh\u00fbn are close allies of the Variags of Khand and are ruled by the nazg\u00fbl Kham\u00fbl.Halls of Fire magazine  The Halls of Fire Magazine mentions the Wainriders still as an existant tribal-alliance in 3019.Leader of one Alliance of Sagath-Wainriders is a man named Hariz\u00e4n.The Easterlings in Middle Earth: Total War  The Middle Earth: Total War Mod provides a background-story for the Easterlings of the late third Age: Of the three Istari who had gone to the Eastern lands Saruman had to retreat, Pallando was killed and Alatar became corrupted.After the fall of the Balchoth Realm, Alatar had finally become Sauron's highest lieutenant in eastern middle-earth and had long started to establish dark cults among the easterlings, one of these sects were the L\u00f4ke Egleria or dragon-worshippers who finally had taken root in the lands of rh\u00fbn and united the disparate tribes after several decades of war. The leading warlord became the L\u00f4ke-Khan or \"Dragon-King\", Alatar's puppet-ruler, who ruled by the force of L\u00f4ke-Rim or Golden Horde, whose members were a professional soldier-class.By 2980 it was the reign of the fourth L\u00f4ke-Khan Borthand. The L\u00f4ke-Rim is divided into four hosts: Another easterling tribe, mentioned nowhere else are the mysterious hazga.The Remnants of the Balchoth also still live in the foothills of Rh\u00fbn.Elendor MUSH  The Elendor MUSH, set shortly before the War of the Ring, names the King of Rh\u00fbn \"Zhamik\". Elendor's Easterlings are presented as a single culture unified in service to Sauron. Their capital is Riavod, ruled by Zhamik and his queen, Meija'hyn of Harad, and controlled by Sauron through the Priesthood of the Eye, headed by the high priestess Cimura. In addition to Sauron (though forbidden by his priesthood), Easterlings also revere various animal spirits. The trade city of Mearingburg frequently trades hands between the Easterlings and Bardings. The Easterlings in Elendor are strongly inspired by the real-world Mongols, dwelling in yurts and fighting from horseback.BfME MODs  Nazgul\u00b4s SEE has additional Units as Spearmen or Pikemen, porters, heavy axemen, heroes as Xaradra and Sharikan and the Easterling king Lorgan.The fourth Age: set in 220 FA, mentions Kh\u00f4ragan and Br\u00fbdhan as Kings of the Easterlings, Heroes vas Sameel and has additional units as the Hastr\u00fbth (Elite-Axeman), light armed Spearmen, Cavalry armed with Spears and catapults.Easterlings of Renown  Abraiz Adajo Bom Ah\u00e2rtal Akil Ak\u00fbta W\u00e2n-Dr\u00e2l Akshir Alafar Mem Amd\u00fbr Ana Anasa Fef Anasa Wem Argaz Asag\u00e1th Asl\u00e2 Khimash Avas I Avas II Avas III Avos of Igath Ayitula Chinta Kari A\u00f4n Baisheuin Ban Bhar\u00e2m Blodren Bloth\u00e1ra B\u00f3r Borhan Bori Borlach Borlach II Borlad Borthand Borthan the third H\u00fbz Boskh\u00edn Br\u00f4da Dr\u00e2l Brodda Brodda II Br\u00fbdhan Calintz Chan Harijiil Chinta Kari (I) Khorth\u00fbl of G\u00f3ak Khorth\u00fbl II Khorth\u00fbl III Khorth\u00fbl IV D\u00e2sak\u00fbn Daurukh Dem\u00eek Dr\u00e2l Dem\u00eek Dr\u00e2l II Dem\u00eek V\u00fbr Dem\u00ees Dr\u00e2l Dendra Dwar Dendra Dw\u00e2r II Dendra Dw\u00eam Dendra W\u00eem Derrim Din Ohtar Dr\u00fagred D\u00fbrthin Edgu Erennis Ethacali Evit Fulgrim Gartog Gizik Gorovod of Medl\u00f3shad Gorovod of Medl\u00f3shad Grallon Grasty Grimburgoth Guton Hariz\u00e4n Hodya H\u00f4s-Harf of Ilanin H\u00f4s Harf IIHuil of Am\u00f4v Hungh Hurdriak H\u00fbz of Am\u00f4v H\u00fbz II H\u00fbz III H\u00fbz IV Iltish Jamukha Jax Joghul Juganoth Jyganoth Kadida Karamar Kargi Karm of N\u00farn Katrisel Kav-Mak\u00f4w of Gathod Kav-Mak\u00f4w of Mirkwood Mak\u00f4w of the Khundolar Kav\u00e2tha Keeta-Skog Kemik Kham\u00fbl Kh\u00e2rsh Khilich Khirgi Khorak\u00f3l Khorgul Kh\u00fbrthan Kl\u00eaa of the Shay Kustig Kuzu Lorgan Lorgan II Low Nose M\u00e2latuk Maran Maraz Mareke Margoz M\u00e1tskild Meonid-Ito the Assassin Meonid of Ashkirir M\u00eeonid-Akhev M\u00eeonid II Nafrati Namu the Rain-man Nevido-B\u00f4m Nevido Sm\u00f4d II Oerlis \u00d4erva Dr\u00e2l \u00d4erv\u00eek Dr\u00e2l Ogdei Ogedei Oldur Onree Oraishapek Oyan Parnelion Sey Pegan Soy Pell Vuk Pos Ari Pos Art Rakadsaol Ingi'inda Grey-cloaked Rof-Paku the Spy Rof-Paku the Magician Ros Bom Rozi R\u00fbdaz Rurzaur Sadun Sameel Sarkan Sen Kay Seyran Shaark Shakal Draik Sharikan Sherk\u00f3z Shomush\u00fak Skauril of Dol Guldur Skauril of Rhunaer Slovas St'e Swiftawulf Tab\u00ee-Kohin Taichu Tai-shan Tarean Tezlik Tham\u00fbl Tigkiz Tiglin Tiliwini Totila T'revor Arain Tros Aran Tros Artri Tr\u00f4s-Hesnef of Ilanin Ulda-Trosh Tros Mira Tuchik Cheyan Tuelik Cheyan Tumna Tup\u00fbrta Ulam Ulband Uldor Uldor II Ulduin Uldul Ulfand Ulfand II Ulfang Ulfang II Ulfast Ulfast II Ulrac Ulrath Ulruth Ulthug Ulwarth I Ulwarth the Protector Uma Kalcuna Urdrath the Banner Bearer Urdrath of N\u00fbrad \u00dbrig-Urpov Urush Urunshar the Kine Usriev Ut\u00fbkel Vacros Vargloth Vezely Voisiol Vorn Vulkh\u00f3s Warlog W\u00f4ma Dr\u00e2l I W\u00f4ma Dr\u00e2l II W\u00f4m\u00ees Dr\u00e2l Xaradra Yaban Yanos-Kosvar Yobad Yumruk Yurin Zarhal K\u00f4z Zhamik Zh\u00f3ja ZulalSynopsis  The Easterling Background of the MERP Canon could be combined with the Storyline given by the Lotr SBG if the War-priests are actually the Theocracy of Kerkassk.The Dragon-Knights could be identical with the Dragon-Worshippers of ME-Total War. Zhamik and Amd\u00fbr could be interpreted as L\u00f4ke-Kans.Haradrim Other Names Short Description  The term Haradrim or Southrons was applied to a large number of very distinct peoples and tribes of southern Middle-Earth.In the closer sense it was used for the cultures of the Haradwaith, a large area which once had been under suzerainty of the kingdom of Gondor and was considered a royal province.The best known Haradrim were the northern Haruze while deep in the south widely varying tribes could be found, among them the Black Barangil peoples of the Utter south who were often considered a culture distinct from the common Haradrim by many scholars.History the first and second Age  Since the N\u00famen\u00f3reans discovered the southern Lands to be populated by strange tribesmen, whom they called the \"Kharai\" (\"Southrons\") or \"Sakal-Lai\" (\"Coastal-People\", a term sometimes applied to the Daen-Folk of southern Gondor) Sages and Loremasters have tried to categorize these strange wild or Dark men.The most common suggestion is that the people of the Harad were largely descendants of the Aravador, the Men who did not turn away at Cuivienen but who had stayed under the influence of the Dark Powers.In the First Age or early Second age migrating groups of wild men, called Harnerim and Narnerim (maybe late neologism by gondorian Scholars or terms learned from the Avari) seem to have come to the then widely uninhabited Regions of the south, if they were late refugees who had abandoned the dark worship or if they were remnants of the ancient dark Realms of the Eastern Lands it is not known.In the north some tribal blending seem to have occurred with southern tribes of the later Daen-Family, also the northern Kharai-tribes who later became the Haruzani were a lighter-skinned people of smaller stature while in central Harad the numerous tribes expanded which later became the Apysans, very tall and dark-skinned men and women, both groups intermingled to a large degree in Far-Harad and produced a number of successor-cultures.The utter South was settled by tall and black-skinned tribes later scholars of Gondor or Avari Elves called the \"Mornedain\" or \"Moratani\", these groups later became the brutal M\u00fbmakani but also the noble Tuktani and their Kirani descendants, in the western Peninsula and the northern Parts of the utter South these tribes intermingled with the Apysan-Culture which later spawned peoples such as the Adena, Dr\u00eal , Pel and Magri.In Eastern Harad at this time there was a migration of tribes who were of Talatherim-Stock, close relatives of the Easterlings of Rh\u00fbn, these also came under the influence of both the northern and southern Harnerim and Narnerim and so are considered Haradrim too, at least by some Scholars.While there were a few Avari elves in the Harad (namely the Cuind and Kinn-Lai) there never seem to have been any friendships between the Kharai and the Quendi,just as there never was much contact between Men and the Dwarves who settled in the Ered Harmal and Ered Laranor.The Kharai seem to have been largely primitive stone-age cultures until the first N\u00famen\u00f3reans started to visit the western coasts of Endor, they started to trade goods with the Sakalai and later established Colonies along the Coast such as Umbar, Bellakar, An Balkumagan (Ciryatandor), the Thani Hazad (The seven lands) and southernmost Tant\u00fbrak.The N\u00famen\u00f3reans seem to have had a great impact on the Kharai as many splinters and myths of the later Haradrim show n\u00famen\u00f3rean influences (such as the many southern Idols which seem to be corrupted versions of the Valar). With growing pressure from the more and more demanding and suppressive Rule of the n\u00famen\u00f3rian Colonies many tribes came under the influence of the Dark lord who at the time was re-appearing in Mordor and established a great realm among the men of Darkness, this was even supported by the rebellion of some southern Colonies against the n\u00famen\u00f3rean Sea-kings, a rebellion which later led to three n\u00famen\u00f3rean Princes to accept rings of power from Sauron, turning them into Nazg\u00fbl: Er-M\u00fbraz\u00f4r, Ad\u00fbnab\u00eath and Kh\u00f4rahil. A fourth and fifth Nazg\u00fbl hailed from the utter south and the Lands north of the Ered Harmal: Ind\u00fbr, a Kirani-Noble and Ren the Unclean, a Sorcerer of the Chail\u00fbzans.With the drowning of N\u00famen\u00f3r the southern colonies finally gained independence and developed into the realms of the Black N\u00famen\u00f3reans who continued to dominate the southern coasts, while the indegenous Kharai established a number of tribal realms in central Harad. With the fall of Sauron the Haradrim regained their freedom for a brief period, although the dark-kingdoms of old seem to have survived the disappearance of the Nameless at last in some areas.\u00a0Third Age  In the Early third Age the Black N\u00famen\u00f3rean Colonies developed into independent Kingdoms and could establish sovereignty about the Haradron tribal realms, although a few remaining Southron Kingdoms were able to develop into recognizable realms in their own right.The by far most powerful Black N\u00famen\u00f3rean Realm was Umbar, which controlled the coasts of Haradwaith until TA 933.In the same year Gondor achieved to conquer Umbar, but the exiled Lords of Umbar, supported by Haradron allies, attempted to reconquer the city in TA 1015 and put the haven under siege for 35 years.After King Hyarmendacil I was able to conquer Near-Harad the Umbarean siege could be ended and large parts of the Haradwaith were\u00a0gondorian terrain.The Gondorian supremacy lasted until the Kin-strife in 1484, although several Lords of the Southern Confederacy supported Castamir and his descendants, others used their Chance to set themselves free of Umbar's influence and allied themselves with the Army of the Southern Dragon, the most prominent of these renegades was\u00a0Mardat the Serpent-Lord, who resided at the City of Karna and was defeated by Hyarmendacil II in TA 1551.In 1810 Telumehtar Umbardacil reconquered Umbar and set up a new Southern confederacy of Puppet-Kings among the Haradrim, however Gondor\u00a0continually lost influence in Harad. The Last time the Haradrim fought against enemies of Gondor was in early 1900, when the Lords of Near-Harad defeated the intruding Wainriders, in 1944 however the conflict was settled, a new King of Near-Harad rose and allied himself openly with the Lords of Rh\u00fbn and Khand and made war on Gondor's southern border.In TA 2194 the first Sun-Lord rose to power in the Bozisha-Miraz and between TA 2339 and TA 2947 Gondor lost it's last allies with the remains of Arthanor.In 28. century Umbar was\u00a0finally\u00a0lost to indigenous Haradrim who now established a Haruze-Dynasty in Umbar, in 2758 these new Corsairs started to raid the coasts of Gondor and western Rohan. The last former gondorian puppet-kings fell in TA 2885 when the Lords of Near-Harad allied with more southern Tribes crossed the fords of Poros but were defied by an allied army of Gondor and Rohan.The following years the Umbarean-dynasty was able to dominate all of Near-Harad and most of the southern coasts, following Sauron's return in 2951\u00a0the Pillar of Pharaz\u00f4n was torn down and Sauronite-Priests became influential on the Mat p'tan of Umbar, mostly due to their dreaded Assassins, the Hasharii.In Far-Harad one of the last Puppet-King's descendants, the Haradrian Lord Sulad\u00e2n rose to power and claimed himself the new Serpent-Lord.With the open support of Mordor and the former Army of the Southern Dragon, now reformed as the Serpent-Army, Sulad\u00e2n was able to spread his influence about the greatest part of Haradwaith and led a huge army of the Haradwaith-confederation against Gondor in the War of the Ring. With the defeat of the Serpent Army also the Last Southron confederation was broken, the early fourth Age saw Gondor reconquering Near-Harad and expanding it's influence on the Haradwaith again.Political Organisation  The Haradrim were divided in numberless tribes and clans.In Near-Harad the Haruze were ruled by Autarbs or local petty-kings of which the most powerful ones were the Taskrals or Stone-Kings. In Far Harad The High-King, or Kralji,had been the formal master of the Lands of Raj or Bozisha-Miraz until the n\u00famen\u00f3rean rule.After the Fall of N\u00famen\u00f3r a council of regents was elected to rule the city Dwellers until a new Kralji would rise, but it had little influence on the desert nomads.The Elite-Warriors of Far-Harad, the Visi, enforced the Regents will.The City-States of the S\u00eerayn, or Mezin-Tarb, were ruled by local Kings, the Tarbs, but actually the Tarb of T\u00fbl Isra had become the mightiest ruler of the area and was simply known as \"the Tarb\". His main officer and enforcer was the Taraskon, and under his subject were the numerous local governors (or Balabett) and Mayors (or Balazain). Magi and scribes also held great power and were often referred to as \"Tyatarbs\" (\"Small Kings\"). Main military power of far-harad was the Army of the southern Dragon which was forged by the Nazg\u00fbl Akh\u00f4rahil and which adhered Sauron\u00b4s rule.All Tarazain and Balazain of the Haradwaith were nominally subordinates of the Nazg\u00fbl Akh\u00f4rahil. There were a number of powerful guilds, the merchant-guild of the Namalo and the caravan-masters of Sirayn and a number of magician guilds, the Karalija, Kromet, Mudrat and Tama. see:Southern ConfederacyLanguages  Haradrim tongues: Black n\u00famen\u00f3rean tongues: Easterling Tongues: See:Religion  The Haradrim followed a number of superstitious indigenous cults as well as religious ideas spawned by the N\u00famen\u00f3reans.

Interactive games MODS Other MUSHs, MUDs, MOOs Metals Avari  The Avari (Q.: \"Refusers\"; Tel. \"Abari\"; S.: \"Evair\") or East-Elves were those Elves who did not go to the west in the Elder Days, but instead spread to the lands east and south due to the wars between Elves, Dwarves, Orcs and Men in the First Age. Tribes of the Avari were known to have lived in Helcarth (or Helkanen), Helcar Sael, northern and southern Cuivienen (Helecerim or Hisildi),\u00a0Luindor (Blue Elves), C\u00edm\u00f3n\u00edemor, Rh\u00fbn, Rhovanion, Eriador, Aegan (Falassear), \u00dbster Kryl,\u00a0Gondor, Haradwaith, Ralian, Mighty Green (Fuinar), T\u00e2lir\u00e2n, central Endor, Uiven and Beleriand (Eolrim).History  After the great separation, the eastern Elves were led by Morwe and Nurwe until an elf called T\u00fb appeared, who made himself a home near the great falls of Cuivienen and found many followers among the wandering Elves - known as the Hisildi. After an Avar called Nuin, during his long wanderings to the south, had incidentally entered the hidded valley of Murmenalda within the Mountains of the Wind, he found the first sleeping children of Men. Soon after, the Avari began to take the young Hildor as their pupils and teach them what they knew of the world, but after some time both peoples drifted apart. This was partially the work of Morgoth, who had come to them in disguise and lured them away from their Elvish friends, and the voice of Eru that used to appear to them on and off. By the help of one of his lesser Maiar - a spirit called Fankil\u00a0-\u00a0Men built a great temple to worship Morgoth. Soon, Men started to quarrel among themselves, some listening to their Elven teachers while others listened to the lies of Fankil and contined to serve the temple. A war broke out with Avari, repenting Men and faithful Dwarves on one side and Orcs, unreasonable Men and corrupt Dwarves on the other side. After the great Battle of Palisor, Avari and Men sepatared, and the Avari themselves became scattered. Some of them - the Windan and Penni\u00a0-\u00a0following a Chieftain called Tareg to the Westlands. Others fled to the North, South or Farthest East. Though some of these tribes would remain loyal and fast friends to the men that fought with them in the Battle of Palisor--these tribes of Avari and Men would eventually make up the Rhun Forest and Dorwinion in the Third Age.Appearance  The Avari were smaller than their Eldarin cousins, and those of Nelyarin descent were even smaller than their Tatyarin brethren, some barely reaching 6'. Most were dark-haired and dark-eyed, with a few copper-haired exceptions among the Tatyar and a few silver-haired and blond exceptions among the Nelyar. Their rejection of the sun and love for the stars and the nocturnal sky made them an unusually pale or sallow or silver-skinned people, although more lavender or olive complexions could be found among the Nelyar and dark, red or swarthy complexions among the Tatyar.Culture  In comparison to the Eldar, the Avari were unlearned and primitive, never having been pupils of the Valar. They shunned the light of the sun and preferred to live a secluded life in the deep mountains, below the earth or in the deep and dark woodlands. They seldomly lived in larger settlements, and only those Nelyarin tribes that lived close to the Sea built boats and ships (and these were simple and primitive in comparison to the ships of the Eldar). Most Avari disliked the mortals; a few Tatyar, however, had befriend the eastern Dwarves, especially those of the Stonefoot kindred, and had learned some of their smithcraft and stonemasonry. The Wild Elves may have been xenophobic and peculiar, but they had never been servants of the Shadow and there was never any friendship between Dark Elves and Orcs or Trolls.Speculations Avari of Renown  Aiganar Aldaron Linvaire Aranlys Eldanar Ardanien Arduin Arxdukanga Boah Agonar Calendal Camthalion Celedhen Chrys Menelrana Dardarien Darien Doronar Elerior Elewen Elor once Dark Enel Eol Hellui Ivanna Jirdfos Laurre Menelrana Lianna Lindal Lindor of Luindor L\u00f4sdalas Lydek Lyerin Lyrin Midhir Mirag Morloth Mormires\u00fbl Morwe Mourmaelgax Namu the Rain-man Nandar Nuin Nurwe Orthir R\u00e1na of Tumlinde Randae Linvaire Randae Terisonen Ringlin Sindacollo Sulcu S\u00fblherok Tareg Taurclax Taurion Terilaen T\u00fb T\u00fbranar Ulgarin Valandor Valnaur Vals\u00fbl ValglinAvari Family Tree  Hisildi:Nazg\u00fbl  The nine Nazg\u00fbl are the highest servants of the Dark Lord.

See:Loremaster (ICE Series)relevant Books Poison  poisons are substances that can cause damage, illness, or death to organisms. In Middle-Earth poisons are used by Nightblades and Orcs as well as for coating Weapons.Weapons are usually made of Plants or animals (such as Spiders and Scorpions).Poisons  Angmarean Incense Asku Black Clover Clugarth Dunach Gorang Helbeniev Hith-i-girith Kennesank Mallic Morsul Muilfam Na-del Nomaniva Nurfraw Ondohithui Pursrak Sulerrain ThurvikCiryatandor Pete Fenlon  Pete Fenlon (born 1955) is an American Role-playing game designer, game developer, graphics designer, cartographer, and publisher. He began creating fantasy role playing rules and drawing large and very detailed full-color Middle-earth maps in MERP modules. He later published science fiction, mystery, and historical games. His diverse works include both electronic and non-electronic stories, art, and game. His work can be found in: Son of an Air Force Colonel (Peter C. Fenlon) and Captain (Melba S. Fenlon, RN), Pete Fenlon was born in Japan. He lived in Tachikawa, Omaha (Nebraska), Washington (DC), Wiesbaden (Germany), St. Louis (Missouri), Midwest City (Oklahoma), Alexandria (Virginia), and Williamsburg (Virginia) before settling in Charlottesville, Virginia. After obtaining a degree in history and anthropology at the University of Virginia, he earned a law degree at the School of William & Mary. Upon passing the bar for of the state of Virginia, he began work as a game designer, developer, and publisher. He has created and published games and fiction since 1980.Autobiography  The following excerpts come from a biographic interview, and are translated from French: \"An avid player of board games and sports, I also always liked games and story-telling. I naturally loved role-playing. I invented stories and plays since I was a boy. When I was a boy scout (I was an Eagle Scout), I created many nature adventures. When I took part in the gaming club while in college at the University of Virginia, I played military simulations. When I started to play D&D in 1974, I focused more on roleplaying games. At the beginning, I made just stories, drawings, and charts. TSR proposed to buy some, but their offer wasn't very good. Instead, I elected to publish my own work. Beginning in 1977 (with Kurt Fischer and S. Coleman Charlton), I began creating the game which we would publish later under the name of Rolemaster. While I was in law school at the College of William & Mary in 1980, I founded ICE with a group of folks who played in my Rolemaster role playing campaign. The group included Coleman Charlton (our principal rules developer), Terry Amthor (author of Spacemaster/Shadow World), Rick Britton (writer/historian), Bruce Shelley (later famous for his work at Avalon Hill, Microprose, and Ensemble Corporation), Bruce Neidlinger (our business guy), Kurt Fischer (my old co-developer), Heike Kubasch, my wife Olivia, and some others. During the 20 years which followed, ICE would publish more adventure game products than any other company, except TSR. Our work would find its way in 13 languages. It was a good 20-year run that started with Arms Law and Iron Wind, included hundreds of game and book publications, and cultimated with the Middle-earth Collectible Card Game. Coleman was our principal author, but I took part in the creation of all the basic books. I drew the majority of the color maps, edited our Middle-earth series, chaired the company, and served as our chief visionary. When we closed the doors of ICE in 2000, we had created and published hundreds of games and books. In 2001, I joined the very talented trio of Jordan Weisman, Sean Stewart, and Elan Lee and became a \"Puppetmaster.\" Along with Dan Carver, Todd Lubsen, Coleman Charlton, and others from the Microsoft team, we crafted a viral, cross-media mystery game to promote Dreamworks/Warner's film AI:Artificial Intelligence. Conceived by Jordan and written by Sean, the game served as a viral marketing campaign for the film by Steven Spielberg, a project begun by Stanley Kubrick. This mysterious game was tracked by players all over the world, and publications like the Guardian, Time Magazine, and New York Times, TV Guide, Entertainment Weekly (and named web site of the year by Entertainment Weekly), the Association of American Publicity, and even Architecture Review. We even received a Cleo Award nomination! A principal character in our story, Jeanine Salla, was the number two Google target for the year 2001. It was a remarkable creative experience. (Thank you Cloudmakers!) At the end of 2001 I drew a color map for the game MageKnight, which was published by WizKids. In 2002, I joined with John Taylor, Kelton Flinn, and Al Roireau (all of EA) to form Castle Hill Studios, LLC. This was an amalgam of ex-employees of ICE and Kesmai Studios. We created entertainment and infrastructure software, most notably Omega (a suite of highly-scalable software designed to manage huge massively multi-player online offerings). We created a couple of experimental game tools for the Microsoft Corporation. In 2003, we embarked on the online game adaptation of Klaus Teuber's award-winning board game The Settlers of Catan. The project was led by Karl Roelofs. The crew included Karl Roelofs, Coleman Charlton, Ed Zavada, Alan Davies, and Ariel Butler. Following the game's publication by Microsoft, I returned to work for a company I had an interest in since 1996: Mayfair Games (Skokie, Illinois). Now, I am a Chairman and Studio Director for Mayfair Games. We are a leading social game publisher. Our many games include the English-language version of The Settlers of Catan, Tigris & Euphrates, Empire Builder, Eurorails, Bang!, Family Business, Shear Panic!, Hey! That's My Fish!, and Pillars of the Earth. I try to remain active apart from work, especially with the Boy Scouts of America. I enjoy sports, bicycling, backpacking, kayaking, whitewater rafting, and most every sort of travel. My wife, folk violist Olivia Johnston, and I live in downtown Charlottesville (where we savor a pretty nice slice of life).See References E\u00e4 D20  E\u00e4 D20 is an attempt to adapt Dungeons and Dragons d20 3.5 edition rules to fit Middle-earth.

It was a rugged region untamed by any dominant civilization.The Land Rhovanion in TA 1650  Aivathiuda divided among six tribes, Gramas among four; land held by family groups. The Northmen who inhabited the plains of Rhovanion east of Mirkwood formed two distinct groups.The semi-nomadic Aivathiuda were by far the largest, but their primitive existence followed their herds of horses and cattle diminished their stature in the eyes of the Gondorians and the more urban Northmen from Dale and Esgaroth. The Grama had adopted a more settled agricultural life, tilling their fields in Mirkwood's eastern Bight with crude implements. A collection of small towns and villages formed the core of Grama society, and regular trade had grown between the communities and with Gondor. The Aivathiuda, on the other hand, remained suspicious of outsiders, and their culture was still very much a warrior society. The Aivathiuda traded only with their Grama kinsfolk, for their differing lifestyles had not yet disturbed the bonds of kinship and common heritage. Gondor eagerly maintained ties with these Northmen for the sake of her cavalry. The horses raised on the Rhovanian plains surpassed any native to Middle-earth. Furthermore, Aivathiudan auxiliaries had won several key victories in the wars for Gondor's borders. The Grama acted as intermediaries in this exchange, and all parties involved benefited to their satisfaction. The Grama produced grain, but their methods were still too crude to produce an exportable surplus. Instead, they relied upon the bounty of their herds for goods to exchange with Gondor and Esgaroth, and to a lesser extent the Men of Dorwinion and the primitive folk who lived within Mirkwood. The Northmen regarded the forest with fear and awe. the home of the baneful magics of Elves and the Necromancer. To their horror, the wood appeared to be growing, engulfing several villages since the Great Plague. Trade with the South had brought many innovations to the Northmen. Steel items now complemented the iron ones forged by Northman smiths. Improved agricultural techniques increase the Grama's yield each year, and the Thanes hoped to export grain to a hungry Gondorian nation within a decade. The sudden advancement had left both Grama and aivathiuda in shock. Their isolated and primitive existence was suddenly interrupted by pressures to trade on an international market. The Aivathiuda found their warlike attitudes obsolete among the merchants of distant lands, so they kept their distance from outsiders, occasionally offering to strike against the tribes of wandering Easterlings who had recently begun to move into Rhovanion in force. The Plague wrought untold devastation among the Northmen, who were first to receive its wrath. Many earlier advances made with the help of Gondor were lost, and contact with the D\u00fanedain diminished. The Northmen remained a loose collection of tribes, more loyal to their kinsfolk than to any broader concept of nationhood.Only once before had a man succeeded in uniting the scattered tribes. Four hundred years before the Plague, a Reik of the Waldandungs named Vidugavia united the Northmen in an alliance to aid Gondor defeat an army of Easterlings. His government, however, was based solely on his personal charisma, and his descendants failed to hold his coalition together. In T . A . 1640, the Waldungs were still the most powerful tribe, and each Thane hoped one day to reproduce the success of Vidugavia. Most of the Grama tribes owed allegiance to the Waldungs, which they confirmed each year with the offering of gifts of tribute and friendship. The Aivathiuda kept their distance from any thoughts of coalition. Though they recognized a Thane as a \"first among equals,\" they proudly maintained their tradition of small, independent clans.Characters  Ainur: Necromancer Radagast Slyardach Dwarves: Ai Azaghal

Cardolan. It was inhabited by the Dynion, a confederation of mixed-blooded eriadorian Clansmen.The Dunmen had contributed to the populace of Saerlann as well as the Cardolanian Northmen and to a degree even the D\u00fanedain.the Realm in TA 1650  Founded after the downfall of Cardolan's royal family by a Dunnish fortune hunter named Gordaig, Saerlann's early years were marked by repeated attacks from the neighboring D\u00fanadan lords who attempted to dislodge this new power. The Dunmen proved tenacious, however, and today Saerlann rests on equal footing with her neighbors. The Kings have organized the land along a tribal model, with the King acting as a High Chief of his own and several lesser tribes. Kinship ties still form the strongest bonds in Saerlann society, and the kingdom, though loosely organized, is closely knit though a complex series of marriage alliances. Despite these bonds of kinship, feuding and revolts plague the kingdom regularly. Though Saerlann culture is violent and boisterous, the King and his chiefs desire nothing more from the outside world than peace. Saerlann rests in the marshy lowlands near the mouth of the Gwathl\u00f3. Though the soil in the area is extremely rich, little effort is made to exploit it fully, for the Men of Saerlann are descendants of highland herders, and the annual floods of the Gwathl\u00f3 defy all attempts by farmers to hold back the water. Fishing, pitch, and salt form the basis of Saerlann's economy. Also vital are the tolls which the King exacts on river traffic heading up the Gwathl\u00f3 to Tharbad. The tribes of Saerlann take care not to levy too steep a toll on the river, for they depend upon the worked metal goods provided by D\u00fanadan craftsmen.In Later Years  Saerlann survived the 17th century collapse and depopulation of Cardolan by virtue of its remoteness from the Witch-king's military centers and its chaotic, but very adaptable, political structure. The Beffraen and the Evilkind of Creb Durga were its primary problems during the ensuing centuries. In T.A. 2116, the capitol of Saerlann was moved from S\u00fathure to Ironwharf, a new port at the mouth of the Isen River; much of its population shifted south of the Gwathl\u00f3. Becoming increasingly submerged amidst the tribal Dunlendings and Beffraen who swelled the population of the kingdom, the culture of the clansmen declined even further. They became a petty-nobility in scattered villages that stretched from the middle of Saerlann to the Dr\u00fawaith Iaur (S. \"Old Pukel Land\"). Suduri, and later Ironwharf, dwindled, for fewer and fewer ships from the south brave the dangerous waters off Cape Andrast. The title of King of Saerlann was still upheld, though its power and authority were but a dim memory. Periodically overun by the Corsairs of Umbar, Saerlann survived in its traditional, haphazard fashion, to become the only Cardolandren successor state to survived into the Fourth Age.Notes:  Original form in MERP: Saralainn. The Name Saralainn may be derived from scottish gaelic sara- (maybe derived from irish saoirse, \"free\" or Sorcha, \"dark\") and -lainn (plural of gaelic lann, \"field, plain\") or it may represent an untranslated local name of Enedhwaith.Another possibility would be to derive it from welsh \"Saer\", ' learned man\" and \"llann\", \"garth or enclosure\".References: ", "Gallowmere Historia": "Gallowmere Historia Sir Daniel Fortesque  Sir Daniel Fortesque (\u30c0\u30cb\u30a8\u30eb\u30fb\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30c6\u30b9\u30af, Danieru F\u014dtesuku) is the main protagonist of MediEvil, appearing as the main protagonist in all the games in the series up to date. He was voiced by Jason Wilson in MediEvil and MediEvil: Resurrection, by Marc Silk in MediEvil 2, and most recently by St\u00e9phane Cornicard in PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale.Story Background  For years, Dan had regaled the nobles of Gallowmere with tales of slain dragons and vanquished legions. The King was so impressed that he made Dan a knight and appointed him head of the Royal Battalion. Of course, it was just an honorary post - Gallowmere had not seen any war in many centuries - but the King liked stories, and Daniel was an excellent storyteller. But then, in 1286 the evil sorcerer Zarok returned from years in exile. Embittered and filled with wrath, he threatened to unleash an army of demons that he built using the \"darkest of magic\". The King was in desperate need of a hero and he knew exactly who he wanted. Daniel was dragged from his bed and thrust at the front of King's army to face the undead horde. The battle commenced and within seconds Dan fell to the ground, struck in the eye with the very first arrow fired. His wound was fatal and the army was left to continue the fight without him. Embarrassed by Dan's poor show, and realising the people needed to feel safe, King Peregrin declared that Sir Daniel Fortesque had died in mortal combat, seconds after slaying the sinister wizard. A hero's tomb was erected to Dan, the history books inscribed with tales of his valour. However, because Dan was not truly a hero, he could never go to the Hall of Heroes, becoming a laughing stock among them.MediEvil / MediEvil: Resurrection  In 1386, Zarok returns again. Using a spell within an ancient book of black magic, he makes the dead rise from their graves to form a legion of unholy warriors. Unfortunately for him, he also unwittingly awakens Sir Dan. Daniel is able to retain his free will, which makes him the only one who can stop Zarok. Awakened from his \"eternal rest\", Daniel reluctantly embarks on a quest to destroy Zarok once and for all. He travels through Gallowmere, aided by the heroes of the past and inhabitants of the land, collecting chalices and fighting Zarok's minions, until he eventually reaches Zarok's Lair. After a great battle, from which Dan emerges victorious, Zarok releases a powerful spell that causes the lair to collapse. Zarok is killed in the process, but Dan manages to escape. Daniel then returns to his crypt and later joins the heroes in the Hall of Heroes. (if all the Chalices are collected in MediEvil.)MediEvil 2  In 1886, 500 years after the events of MediEvil, a man seeking world domination finds the spellbook and raises the dead as Zarok did many centuries ago. Dan is awakened again, this time in an old museum located in Kensington, London. Winston, a helpful ghost, explains the situation to Dan and leads him to his summoner, Professor Hamilton Kift. The professor tasks Daniel with finding out who's behind the spell and collecting magical energy to help in fighting the crisis. While looking for clues, Dan manages to free an Egyptian princess by the name of Kiya from her tomb, who he falls in love with. They manage to identify the villain as Lord Palethorn, an ambitious industrialist. After realizing that he needs the final pages of the spellbook to obtain full control over his monsters, they decide to find them before Palethorn does. Dan journeys through London, fighting monsters, collecting chalices and even traveling through time. He eventually corners Palethorn in Cathedral Spires, where the fiend manages to obtain all of the spellbook pages and summons a demon to kill Dan. Thankfully, Daniel manages to defeat the demon. In his last attempt to defeat Dan, Palethorn activates a time bomb which causes the entire area to explode. Dan manages to survive, however. His fate depends on the amount of chalices the player collected throughout the game:Abilities  Being undead, Daniel has a few unique abilities, some of which are gained over time.Appearance  Daniel is a skeleton without a left eye and lower jaw, with his upper jaw having misshapen and crooked teeth. His eye colour varies from game, ranging from gray, to black, to gold (as seen in Playstation All Stars), to (as seen in the MediEvil PS4 trailer) blue. He is rarely shown alive, with a helmet always obscuring his face (aside from his eyes, which are either gold or grey coloured), but the history books describe him having a square jaw, steely gaze and a thick shock of hair, as black as ravens' wings. In MediEvil: Resurrection's stained glass opening, he is shown with blond/brown hair instead, and with pale skin and crooked teeth not unlike the ones his skull has. He is usually wearing silver/grey armour with gold hints, a red and gold doublet and brown leather gloves (only in the second game). Throughout the games, Daniel sports multiple outfits and armours.Personality  Daniel is a very cowardly knight, but despite this, he is a very loyal fighter. He seems to have a sarcastic sense of humour and holds very little patience to some, but he is rather respectful as per the knight's code. Though he is often reluctant to be a hero, he usually finds a bit of courage and ends up saving the day, and will willingly help those in need. He is annoyed by Al-Zalam and Zarok, though in the former they end up becoming close friends. Daniel is also shown to be chivalrous, as he is a knight, and caring towards those he loves, especially towards Kiya and is especially saddened by her death, to the point he can't go on to defeat Palethorn and has to travel back in time to rescue her from Jack the Ripper. He also can be rather cocky sometimes and dislikes being told he is a coward and a faker, as shown when the gargoyles, the Heroes (particularly Woden the Mighty) or Al-Zalam berate him. He is quick to spot sarcasm and dislikes being reminded of his failure.Non-MediEvil appearances Everybody's Golf 2  Sir Dan appears as one of the three unlockable \"guest characters\" in Hot Shots Golf 2.

He is voiced by Paul Darrow in English and by Norio Wakamoto in Japanese.Story Background  Zarok was King Peregrin's advisor and court magician. Zarok, however, began conducting horrific experiments on the bodies of the dead. When the King found out, he banished Zarok from the land. All of his living dead were routed out and destroyed. Zarok, being an unforgiving soul, went into hiding and vowed to wreak his revenge on the King. He employed the aid of Shadow Demons to help him build a vast castle. Under the cover of night, Zarok's dark army spilled forth from their corrupt haven. The army marched south across the Silver Mountains and through the Silver Woods. Soon afterwards, even the Pumpkin lands belonged to Zarok. Retaliation was swift and violent, King Peregrin's forces led by Sir Daniel Fortesque drove Zarok's army back from Gallows Town. There was much rejoicing, but the war was not over yet. Zarok's army had then overtaken the flood lands. He knew the King would try and stop him, so he prepared an ambush. This lead to the Battle of Gallowmere, in which Sir Daniel was killed. The history books said that he had defeated Zarok, just seconds before dying himself. Zarok survived the battle, however. He remained in hiding, preparing a more powerful, stronger army of unholy monsters.MediEvil\u00a0/ MediEvil: Resurrection  100 years after the war, Zarok returns to Gallowmere once again. Using the powers of a spell book spell, Zarok steals the souls of the townspeople and resurrects the dead. While passing through Gallowmere's many locales, Zarok leaves behind him a green, slimy trail of magic. He is looking for the Shadow Artifact, which is required to open the tomb in which Shadow Demons are held. Daniel first encounters Zarok at\u00a0Cemetery Hill. Zarok tries trapping Dan in the necropolis by bringing two Gargoyles to life. Later in the game, Daniel releases Zarok's Shadow Demons, because he needs an item located within the tomb to make further progress. The demons are killed, however, when Daniel releases lava upon them in The Haunted Ruins. Zarok awaits in his lair. He sends\u00a0Fazguls and later his champion Lord Kardok to kill Dan, but Daniel manages to outsmart them. In the end, Zarok decides to confront Dan himself and transforms into a monster.\u00a0Upon defeat, he casts a spell that causes his lair to collapse. He is then crushed in the wreckage.MediEvil 2  Although Zarok himself doesn't make an appearance, his spellbook is the main cause of the events that occur. A likeness of his monster form can be found in the museum along with a book declaring him a coward. The original plot of the game involved him being trapped in the Tower of London, implying he may have survived being crushed by his lair.Fate's Arrow  Zarok would have been the main antagonist once more, teaming up with Kiyante, an evil sorceress with similar ambitions.Abilities  Using the power of his staff and spellbook, Zarok can resurrect the dead, animate the inanimate and steal the souls of living beings. He was also able to build his own boiler guards and city; The Time Device - using science.Personality  Zarok is a creepy, bitter and twisted soul. He is petty and vain yet intelligent, terrifying and evil yet charismatic, tough and dangerous yet at times campier than a Caravan park. He berates Daniel and calls him mocking nicknames. He also seems to be held in a very high regard amongst his minions. In MediEvil: Resurrection, there is a running gag of him not being able to give an evil laugh.Appearance  Zarok has pale grey/greenish skin and yellow eyes, and a somewhat feminine attire which consists of purple/red robes with gold highlights and a helmet with pointed \"horns\". He is rather thin, and he has two horns on each cheek. In MediEvil: Resurrection, his outfit has green gems, possibly to match his trident. His eyes are pale yellow/green and sometimes glow when he casts magic.Non-MediEvil\u00a0appearances Creatures  An image of Zarok appears in Creatures, an artificial life program created by Millennium Interactive.PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale  Zarok appears as a downloadable minion in PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale. He is also mentioned multiple times throughout Sir Dan's arcade mode.Quotes MediEvil MediEvil: Resurrection Trivia External links MediEvil  MediEvil (\u30e1\u30c7\u30a3\u30fc\u30d0\u30eb \u7526\u3063\u305f\u30ac\u30ed\u30e1\u30a2\u306e\u52c7\u8005, Med\u012bbaru Yomigaetta Garomea no Y\u016bsha) is an action-adventure video game and the first installment in the MediEvil series. It was developed by SCE Studio Cambridge and published by Sony. It was released on October 9, 1998 in Europe, October 21, 1998 in North America and on June 17, 1999 in Japan for the PlayStation. Due to its success, the game was released in 1999 as a platinum title in Europe. It was also released in a bundle with C-12: Final Resistance on May 9, 2003. The game was followed by MediEvil 2, released in 2000, and MediEvil: Resurrection, a reimagining released in 2005 for the PSP. The game was made available for download for the PSP, PlayStation 3 and the PS Vita via the PlayStation Store in 2007. A remaster of the game for the PS4 is currently in the works.Gameplay  During the game, the player must go through several places, from a graveyard full of zombies, to a flying ghost ship full of undead pirates, to a levitating board in an enchanted forest surrounded by flying demonettes. There are also several collectible items found in the levels which have to be collected in order to proceed to further areas or levels. There are several books placed upon stands all over areas in the game which may offer advice to Sir Dan, while some others contain humorous jokes or generally the history of the area. Some of them are placed in hidden places, but they are mostly found along the path that Sir Dan takes. They can be read if struck with a close range weapon.Weapons  Dan starts the game with just his detachable arm, which can be used as both a melee weapon and a projectile, but is incredibly weak. Soon, however he obtains a small sword. The majority of weapons Dan encounters are received from the Hall of Heroes by collecting Chalices in each level, and range from swords, axes and hammers to projectile weapons such as crossbows and spears. There are other weapons that Dan encounters through the course of the game, such as a club that can be used as a torch, but breaks after too much use; a Dragon Armour that lets Dan breathe fire and protects him from flame attacks; and Chicken Drumsticks that can turn enemies into Roast Chicken for health recovery. Dan is also able to find a variety of shields to protect himself, ranging from copper to gold in strength.Chalice of Souls  Throughout the levels Sir Dan is presented with an opportunity to collect that particular level's chalice, by filling it up with the souls of his enemies. This mystical item enables him to visit the Hall of Heroes after the conclusion of the level. Dan can only collect the chalice in each level when he has dispatched enough \"defeated adversaries\" to reach 100%. Chalices are hidden well and are not always at the end of a level, so Dan must back-track to the beginning to find it. In the \"Hall of Heroes\", he can converse with past heroes, \"await spiritual guidance\" and receive useful items or weapons to help him in his quest. Collecting all the chalices allows the player to see the true ending.Enemies  Alongside certain weapons, there are also many colourful and varying enemies, though particularly zombies in the opening levels, which Dan must defeat. Later on through the epic journey through Gallowmere, Dan will encounter a number of other monsters and creatures, most of which are modelled after gothic demons associated with the time period. Sticky-fingered Imps, demonic Scarecrows, and Zarok's boiler guards are but a few of the ghastly and varied monstrosities that inhabit the levels.\nVery simple weapons will require much use in order to finish off a single enemy. Some enemies can only be attacked either at certain times or using specific weapons, such as the Scarecrows. Many weapons, such as swords and throwing daggers, can be charged up to produce a more powerful attack to finish beasts off more quickly.Characters Plot  The game starts with a flashback in the 13th century in the fictional Kingdom of Gallowmere and puts the player in control of Sir Daniel Fortesque: the reanimated skeleton of a deceased champion knight whom history holds in high esteem, due to his supposed heroics in battle against the evil sorcerer Zarok who, in 1286, had raised an army of demons and set out to take over the kingdom. The legend has it that Fortesque lead the King's army into battle against Zarok's demonic hordes and that Sir Daniel himself killed the sorcerer during the battle - despite having actually been mortally wounded at the outset - cementing his posthumous status as the \"Hero of Gallowmere\". This official version of events is later revealed as being vastly exaggerated and that Sir Dan's entire reputation is based on a lie. It turns out that Fortesque was not a hero at all and was in fact the first to die during the Battle of Gallowmere as he was hit in the eye by an arrow while leading the first charge against Zarok's undead armies. Although Sir Dan's troops still managed to go on and win the battle without him, Zarok was able to escape and went into hiding, leading everyone to assume that he was dead. The \"fog of war and the shrouds of time\" ultimately conspired to portray Fortesque as being the great hero of the battle. One century later, in 1386, Zarok unexpectedly re-emerges from the shadows, robs the citizens in a nearby village of their souls and awakens his undead army. But the waves of necromantic energy he has unleashed upon the countryside have unwittingly revitalized the skeletal corpse of Sir Fortesque, still missing the eye where he was hit and unable to speak clearly having lost his jawbone. Sir Dan pulls a cobweb out of his eye socket, shakes off the trauma and then grins at the player. Unable to go to the Hall of Heroes in death due to his failures in life, Sir Fortesque sets out from his crypt to exact his revenge upon Zarok and prove himself a true hero now that he has been given a second chance. After finding a way out of the cemetery, getting through the rest of Gallowmere, making his way to the entrance of Zarok's lair and getting past every other obstacle the lair has, Dan finally makes his way to the lair's arena, where Zarok is waiting. There, Zarok sends out his fleet of skeletal warriors. But before doing this, Dan places one of the chalices he collected throughout the game onto the white circle in the middle of the arena. This summons the souls belonging to the soldiers who fought in the war a century ago. Seeing that they are all ghosts, their weapons will affect Zarok's warriors, so they charge straight towards them and start fighting while Dan keeps his side alive by zapping them with good lightning (if the player fails to do this, Zarok's side will knock Dan out, resulting in an immediate game over.) Once Zarok's side loses, Dan's warriors cheer while turning into health vials that Dan collects to get as much energy back as possible (he loses it while using the good lightning on his side). Zarok then summons his champion, Lord Kardok, a skeletal man wielding a mace and riding a skeletal horse. After Dan defeats him, Zarok finally has enough of Dan getting in the way and goes to his lab. There, he tries to turn himself into a monster capable of defeating Dan, while humorously having trouble casting the right spell. Zarok eventually gets it right and then enters the arena revealing himself to be a wingless dragon of some sorts. The two fight, with Dan ending up victorious. Zarok then explodes into his normal form, while admitting defeat. Zarok then gets up and states that if he is to fail, then all shall perish and that Sir Dan is doomed to stay in his lair forever. He then zaps the ceiling with his trident, which makes the roof cave in. While this happens, a big hunk of debris falls on top of Zarok with a humorous squeak. Dan then escapes and makes his way out to the arena entrance while the lair is falling apart. A small flying creature flies towards him, then the two get blown back by the explosion of a sundial that was next to them. Dan manages to hang onto one of the floating cogs from The Time Device till he gets to a small cave. After brushing the dust off of his amour, Dan runs away from the fire caused from the lair's destruction, but he is unable to outrun it and the explosion sends him off the cliff. As he's falling to his doom, a giant vulture catches him and takes him back to his crypt while the stolen souls return to the people of Gallowmere. The vulture then drops him off at his crypt, which Dan re-enters and returns to his eternal rest.Endings  The ending is determined by whether or not the player collected all the Chalices of Souls:Development  Development of\u00a0MediEvil\u00a0started in 1995 at independent developer\u00a0Millennium Interactive. Chris Sorrell, previously known for the\u00a0James Pond\u00a0series, created the original concept for MediEvil and served as the game's creative director. Prior to the development of\u00a0MediEvil, Sorrell had endured a rather torrid time working on some edutainment products that Millennium Interactive had signed up to create. \"Once these products were finally complete, I think management took pity on me and rewarded me with the chance of making my dream game\" he recalls. According to Sorrell, the first design proposal for the game had the working title \u2018Dead Man Dan\u2019 and described a game that was a fusion of\u00a0Capcom's\u00a0Ghosts 'n Goblins\u00a0with the art style of\u00a0Tim Burton \u2013 especially the look and feel of\u00a0The Nightmare Before Christmas, both of which were things that he was a huge fan of back in the mid \u201990s. Lead artist and designer Jason Wilson shared his interest in dark, Gothic influenced artwork and they worked together to define the look and feel of the game. Wilson was particularly inspired by German Expressionism\u00a0from the 1920s and credits films such as Der Golem, The Cabinet of Dr Caligari, Nosferatu, Metropolis and Sunrise as his main sources of inspiration. As development progressed, Wilson pushed the game into more of a\u00a0Zelda-like direction as opposed to the original arcade-style concept. Sorrell approved of the new direction and said that he would liked to have expanded more on it. From the outset, Sorrell wanted his game to possess a unique lead character. They worked with a script doctor named Martin Pond when looking for more of a backstory for the lead protagonist, Sir Daniel Fortesque. Pond came up with the idea that Sir Daniel could have been a pompous failure in life whose reincarnation was his one shot at redemption. In addition to bringing together a brand new team \u2013 none of whom had really made a 3D game of this scale before \u2013 they were in \u2018sell\u2019 mode almost from day one, with the future of the studio riding on their ability to attract a major publishing deal as quickly as possible. They were initially working on multiple platforms including Windows\u00a0and\u00a0Sega Saturn\u00a0as well as PlayStation before finally having the chance to pitch an early demo to Sony, who were so impressed with their work that they bought the whole studio and became Sony's second United Kingdom development studio. Late in the game's development, Sony requested that\u00a0MediEvil\u00a0should support the (then) new PlayStation analogue controller, which Sorrell described as a \"particularly fortuitous event\" as it allowed them to capture much more fluidity and intuitiveness within the game. Sorrell said that\u00a0MediEvil\u00a0presented a mountain of challenges due to the fact that, like many other developers at the time, they were still very new to 3D gaming. Things like camera and character control presented many interesting new challenges and required the team to try out a number of approaches before settling on solutions that seemed to work. He said that they spent many long nights without sleeping, trying to finish the game. There were also many levels and ideas from the original concept that they were forced to removed because of time and budget constraints. In most cases, the best of what they had already created for those levels ended up being spliced into the levels that they shipped with. There was also intended to be a platform oriented section of the game where the player would control the worm that lived in Daniel's skull. Concept art and a level ost was created for this section, but it never materialized into the game. Even so, Sorrell said that the game still came very close to the original concept and he was most proud of how the team pulled together to finish the game without compromising on the quirky attention to detail or scope of the game.Tools Graphics Music  The following tools, CD samples and\u00a0software were used to create the game's original soundtrack:Additional content  Inside copies of the platinum version of the game's PlayStation box was a poster featuring an insight into MediEvil's sequel, MediEvil 2. This detailed new characters and levels, set in 19th century London. On the reverse of this image are map instructions for the first four levels of the game. These include details of the locations of vials, the chalice, life bottles, rune stones, gargoyles, rune hands, copper and silver shields, primary weapons and other secrets which may only be accessible after finding certain items or completing certain tasks.Soundtrack  The original soundtrack of the game was made using electronic synthesizers to simulate an entire orchestra and organ. The tracks were composed by Paul Arnold and Andrew Barnabas. Chris Sorrell, the game's director, asked them to compose a Danny Elfman-style score, similar to those of Beetlejuice, The Nightmare Before Christmas and Batman Returns. Although there's no official soundtrack release, the 71st issue of the french magazine Joypad featured a CD named Les musiques de Medievil, which contains 10 tracks from the game and is the only \"soundtrack\" ever released for it.Reception  MediEvil received positive reviews, with an 80.40% aggregate rating at Game Rankings. The game received a 7.8/10 from IGN. IGN heralded it as \"A fun game and one of PlayStation's classics\". GameSpot gave it an 8.2/10, proclaiming that the game is a \"welcome surprise\".Game Revolution gave the game an A\u2212 and stated that \"what we have here is one of the cleverest platform games ever made\".Awards Sales Trivia See also External links MediEvil 2  MediEvil 2 (stylised as MediEvil II in North America) is an action-adventure video game and the second installment in the MediEvil series.

He is recruited by a professor named Hamilton Kift and his ghostly sidekick Winston to recover the missing pages of Zarok's spellbook and put a stop to Palethorn's plans. Along the way, they end up being joined by an ancient mummy princess named Kiya, who becomes Dan's love interest. During an incident in which Kiya goes off on her own, she is killed by Jack the Ripper, much to the shock of Dan. Discovering a time machine, Dan travels back in time in order to save Kiya, merging with his past self to gain super armour. As Dan finally confronts Palethorn, he steals the final page from him and uses it to summon a demon. However, Dan manages to turn the demon against Palethorn, putting a stop to both of them.Endings Reception  The game received good reviews from critics, with an 79.47% aggregate rating at Game Rankings.\u00a0The game was criticized by reviewers for its bad camera angles at points, difficulty and for sometimes being confusing, but was praised for its humor and approachability, among other things. IGN gave the game a score of 8.4, stating that the game \"is clever, sick, and funny\" and better than the first. Gamespot gave it a 7.6, praising the content and features while criticising the camera.

It is home to many mystical, mythical creatures, like Dragon toads, Rhinotaurs\u00a0and\u00a0Dragon birds. MediEvil and MediEvil: Resurrection take place in Gallowmere.Towns and cities  Gallows Town (known as The Sleeping Village in-game) is a town lying near the center of the island. Not much is known about the town. Its inhabitants were possessed by Zarok during the game's events. The town has a library, church, pub and smithy. Castle Peregrin (known as The Haunted Ruins in-game) was once Gallowmere's seat of power and home to the royal household, before it fell to ruin and became abandoned. There is lava underneath the castle which is held back by a set of floodgates. Mellowmede (known as The Lake in-game) was once a town of arcane alchemy, before being destroyed by Rhinotaurs and flooded by the murky swamps. The ancient people of this long vanished town once sought to harness the power of Crystals within the Crystal Caves. The city now lies in ruin. The City of Madness (known as The Time Device in-game) is a city built by Zarok using the darkest of magics.\u00a0The city is home to many of his obscure inventions, including his boiler guards. Another notable invention is a train, which he uses to travel around the city faster. In the middle of the city lies Zarok's lair, his personal domain.Trivia Everybody's Golf 2  Everybody's Golf 2 (\u307f\u3093\u306a\u306eGOLF2, Minna no Golf 2), known as Hot Shots Golf 2 in North America, is the second game in the Everybody's Golf series.

Like in the first game, there are several characters to choose from, and many more to be unlocked throughout the game. Each character has his or her own strengths and weaknesses, making character selection more than just choosing a skin. The character models themselves are more realistic looking as opposed to the big-headed anime style of the original. Again, there are several different modes of play, from standards like Stroke, Match, and Tournament play, to the versus, through which new characters can be unlocked. Gameplay itself is a version of the standard '3 click' variety used by the majority of golf games.Characters  There are 13 playable characters in the game:Courses External links MediEvil 2 - Front Cover PAL.JPG MediEvil: Resurrection  MediEvil: Resurrection is the third installment in the MediEvil series. It is a reimagining of the original MediEvil. It was released as a launch title for the PSP on September 1, 2005, in Europe and on September 13, 2005, in the United States. The game was released as a platinum title in Europe on June 2, 2006. It was made available for download from the PS Store in Europe on May 29, 2008, and in the United States on June, 26 2008.Differences from MediEvil  The game features many alterations to the original structure and content, such as:Gameplay  Gameplay is similar to that of the original game. Dan can utilise a variety of weapons, including melee weapons such as swords and axes and ranged weapons like throwing daggers and crossbows. If Dan defeats enough enemies to collect the Chalice of Souls hidden throughout each level, he will be able to travel to the Hall of Heroes where a legendary hero will reward him with a new weapon or other helpful items. Dan possesses a single life bar throughout the game, which can be sustained by collecting Life Bottles throughout the game which can be replenished by energy vials and Life Fountains. The PSP version also includes some exclusive minigames which can also be played using local multiplayer.Characters Plot  The game starts out as a narrative, telling the player about the Kingdom of Gallowmere. The game puts the player in control of Sir Daniel Fortesque: a brave (according to him) knight who, despite his tales of gallantry, was the first to die during the battle against the evil wizard Zarok; he was hit in the eye by an arrow in the first charge of a battle with Zarok's undead armies back in 1286. However, his story was warped to make it that he is a hero. One century later, in 1386, Zarok returns, casts a spell which curses an eternal night upon Gallowmere, robs the citizens in a nearby village of their souls and awakens his undead army. Sir Dan is then woken up by Al-Zalam, a genie who Zarok robbed of his powers and cursed to reside in Dan\u2019s skull (which shall never be lifted until Zarok dies). Unable to go to the Hall of Heroes in death due to his failures in life, Sir Fortesque sets out from his crypt to exact his revenge upon Zarok, free Al-Zalam from his head and \"prove himself a true hero\" now that he has been given a second chance. After finding a way out of the cemetery, Dan comes across Death. After talking, Death tells Dan about how to defeat Zarok. He must collect all four pieces of the Anubis Stone, an artefact that was used in the battle a century ago. The first piece is buried in the same cemetery where Death was encountered. The second piece is held by the Mayor of the Sleeping Village, who gets captured by Zarok and his Boiler Guards and is later released by Dan. He tells Dan to find the Shadow Demon Claw (used to wake up the Shadow demons). The third piece is in the possession of the witch of Pumpkin Gorge. She wants Dan to defeat the Pumpkin King, a large Jack-O-Lantern-like monster. The last piece is in the castle of King Peregrin. Soon, after finding all four pieces, getting through the rest of Gallowmere and making his way to the entrance of Zarok's lair, Dan goes inside, where Zarok is waiting. There, Zarok sends out his regular minions, then his champion Lord Kardok, a zombie centaur wielding a bow. Once the minions and Kardok have been beaten, he sends out his fleet of Fazgul warriors and then states that they are all immune to mortal weapons. While doing this, Dan fixes the pieces of the Stone, then holds it up to the sky. This summons the souls belonging to the soldiers who fought in the war. Seeing that they are all ghosts, their weapons will affect Zarok's warriors, so they charge straight towards them and start fighting while Dan keeps his side alive by zapping them with some of the Stone\u2019s energy (if the player fails to do this, Zarok's side will gang up on Dan and finish him off, resulting in an immediate game over). Once Zarok's side loses, Dan's warriors cheer while turning into health vials that Dan collects to get as much energy back as possible (he loses it while using the energy on his side). After the Fazguls fall, Zarok has nothing else left to fight Dan with. Then, Zarok taunts Dan by asking him about creatures that slither. He soon finds out that snakes scare Dan, so he transforms into a giant cobra in a last-ditch effort to defeat Dan. The two fight, with Dan ending up victorious. Zarok then melts into his normal form while admitting defeat. Zarok then states that if he is to fail, then all shall perish and Sir Dan will never leave his lair. He then emits a shockwave with the last amount of magic he has, which makes the lair cave in and the volcano that its built over start melting everything in its path. Dan runs for his life but trips and is knocked out. Afterwards, a giant statue resembling Zarok falls on top of him. Al-Zalam then finds out that he is finally free and powerful again, so he flies off. Dan wakes up and tries to get away, but is soon trapped on a piece of debris, slowly getting eaten away by the lava. Luckily, Al-Zalam spots Dan, grabs his hand and takes him back to his crypt while daylight returns and the stolen souls return to the people. Once inside, Al-Zalam drops Dan and the two wave goodbye, with Dan returning to his eternal rest.Ending  Dan then gets taken to the Hall of Heroes. When he arrives, the rest of the heroes have come to life and have prepared a feast, ready for Dan\u2019s arrival. Once Dan sits down in the chair prepared for him, one of the heroes fills up a goblet with wine; Dan then unsuccessfully drinks it, shrugging his shoulders as the wine falls through his skeletal body and lands on the floor. His transparent statue then becomes solid, and the other heroes cheer and applaud him for finally having the courage to defeat Zarok once and for all. The game then returns to the narrative, which states the epilogue and also hints towards Zarok returning in a sequel, and then the credits roll.Development  Development of MediEvil: Resurrection began in 2003. The senior management team at Sony Europe wanted a launch game for the PlayStation Portable and it was decided that a remake or \u201cremix\u201d of the original MediEvil was the way to go. Part of the reason for this was a very short predicted development time \u2013 the development team was given only a year to get the game ready, while an original title would likely have taken considerably longer. Despite the success of the original, and despite having been developed within SCE Cambridge Studio, MediEvil: Resurrection was not created by Chris Sorrell or the original PS1 team. Sorrell had stressed to his studio management that he would love to direct the PSP game and bring MediEvil up to date, but the license to the 24 TV series had become available to Sony and he was instead instructed to direct the video-game adaptation, 24: The Game. Since the release of MediEvil: Resurrection, Sorrell has expressed disappointment with the changes to the game and the fact that his superiors did not allow him to direct it. Piers Jackson was instead appointed as the producer for MediEvil: Resurrection. He directed development and project managed the title, working closely with a new design team led by Dominic Cahalin. Mitch Phillips, who was the character animator for the previous two installments, was appointed as lead artist for the game. He and Bob and Barn, the soundtrack composers, were the only people from the original team to return. The game was originally developed on a PS2 and then ported to the PSP - lead designer Dominic Cahalin lamented that the PS2 version was never made available as it was more playable on PS2 than the PSP version, benefiting greatly from the precision of the dedicated PS2 controller. According to Piers Jackson, the thrust of the design was to produce a title that could showcase the full abilities of the PSP, including its built-in Wi-Fi capabilities. He also said that everything about the game was different from the original MediEvil. Whilst they had taken the basic story and some of the locations from the original game, all the code, graphics and voices were different and they expanded the plot, added mini-games, multiplayer facilities and a PSP-friendly save anywhere function. He also said that they had tried to preserve ideas that they thought worked well in the original, though their use was altered or repositioned to keep the game fresh even to those who had played the original. The addition of the Anubis Stone sub-plot was to strengthen the story arc and the creation of Al-Zalam was to act as Dan's internal monologue and the player's guide.Soundtrack  The music in the soundtrack is split into two halves. The cues from the first half are largely reminiscent of a select number of cues from the original game (1 track from the second game was also used), with the addition of extra thematic elements to strengthen and tie them together. The other half of the music is totally original, and written exclusively for this iteration of the franchise. All the music was performed live. The orchestra consisted of around 80 players and was made up of members of the Prague Philharmonic and recorded in Prague on the Barrandov Recording Stage. In addition the score benefits from a 32 piece choir, also recorded in the same venue.Reception  MediEvil: Resurrection received mixed reviews upon release. The game holds average rankings of 66 on Metacritic and 68.96% on Game Rankings. General complaints from reviewers were directed at the camera control, which was cited as being particularly poor during combat sequences, as well as occasional frame rate drops. The combat was also criticized for its awkward hit detection. IGN gave the game a 7.3, praising the graphics, soundtrack, and content but said that the fighting mechanics needed work.GameSpot gave the game a 6.1, stating \"The game hasn't aged well, and although it has plenty of personality, the maddening camera control and broken combat mechanics quickly spoil the fun\".GameCritics was one of the harshest reviewers, giving the game a score of 4/10 and stating \"I honestly do think that Sir Daniel Fortesque is a good character with potential, but I would have much rather seen an all-new game with a nod towards current methodology than a rehash of something that honestly wasn't all that great in the first place\". Chris Sorrell and Jason Wilson, co-creators of MediEvil, have also expressed disappointment with the game. Neither of them had any involvement with MediEvil: Resurrection, and when they were asked about the game during an interview with RetroGamer, Jason Wilson said, \u201cIt was a strange feeling to see something you loved being remade by others. I now know what all those directors feel like when their movies are remade.\u201d Chris Sorrell said that he was disappointed by the redesign of the game and how there were a number of aspects to MediEvil PSP that weren't really what he would have chosen. He did say, though, that the development team did an impressive job creating the game considering the time constraints they were up against. The game did receive a more positive reception and higher review scores from several sites. Critics unanimously praised the game\u2019s graphics, soundtrack, voice-acting, and over-all content for the PSP. Game Over Online countered arguments by many critics, stating that although the camera issues and combat problems complicated several things, the game itself was still more than adequate as a basic platformer and awarded it a 7.7/10. Gaming Illustrated gave it an 8.2, saying that it was a solid title whose best features include the humor, story, and amount of modes the game had to offer. Game Chronicles gave the game a score of 86% stating that the game \"Offers a quality presentation of a sometimes-awkward game, but for the most part you can overcome the quirky camera and really get into the melee and ranged combat. And the collection of mini-games rivals a handheld version of 'Mario Party'.\" Game Zone website added that the title is \"Really easy to pick up and play. The controls are very easy and responsive. The mini puzzles that are presented to the gamers are easy enough to understand yet still provide a nice challenge.\"Sales  Despite mixed reviews, MediEvil: Resurrection was a commercial success. The game was reported to have sold over 1 million copies worldwide, which was far more than originally predicted.Trivia See also External links Games  Games based in the MediEvil universe or related to it.SirDanME2 Render.png Princess Kiya  Princess Kiya (  ) is a major protagonist and Dan's love interest in MediEvil 2.Appearance  Kiya is a blue mummy with long black hair and green eyes.

She wears brown boots as well as a red navel gem, a gold tiara/headband and matching necklace, and triangular earrings which are obscured by her hair. During the Iron Slugger fight, she wears bright red shorts over her bandaged area.Personality MediEvil 2  Kiya is described as being soft and slowly spoken, enunciating every word as if she was delighted for being able to speak after many years. From what Kift describes her, she is also a bit slow on catching up. She is very respectful towards Dan, calling him a great warrior after he rescued her. She is also eager to explore the world as she states that she does not want to stay imprisoned.Fate's Arrow  In Fate's Arrow, Kiya would have been revealed to be an evil sorceress named Kiyante.\u00a0She would have also been revealed to have been merely tricking Dan, meaning her previous personality was merely a facade. Not much else is known about this version of her.Story Background  At the age of 19, Kiya was selected by the Pharaoh Ramesses to be one of his 200 wives. Fortunately for her, he was very old and died before he was able to consummate the marriage. Unfortunately, she was selected to \"accompany\" him on his journey to the afterlife as his bride through eternity. In 1817, many of Ramesses' possessions, including the contents of Kiya's tomb, were recovered from a tomb at Abu Simbel and brought to Europe, where they were eventually placed in the Great Museum.MediEvil 2  Daniel saves Kiya from her tomb in The Museum while looking for clues in Kensington. When she awakens, she's a little startled to discover that she's dead. She falls out of her coffin and is caught by Daniel as she falls. He then takes her to the Professor's lab. During the Dankenstein level, Kiya helps the professor build a monster to fight in a match against the Iron Slugger. The main prize of the match was to be Kiya herself. Daniel manages to win the battle and she remains with Dan and the professor. Later in the game, she insists on investigating Whitechapel, but Dan tells her not to since he thought it was too dangerous for her. Kiya decides to go anyway, and doesn't return. The professor sends Dan to search for her. When Daniel finally finds her, he sees Jack the Ripper attack her and kill her. Saddened and enraged by the sudden turn of events, Daniel finds a way to travel back through time and manages to fight the killer in order to save her. After Jack's defeat, Kiya and Dan share a passionate kiss. Kiya doesn't appear from this point on until the end of the game. What happens to her and Dan depends on the amount of chalices collected by the player.Fate's Arrow  After her and Dan's journey through time, Kiya is nowhere to be found. Dan later learns from The Oracle that Kiya is actually an evil sorceress called Kiyante, Queen of the Withering Sun. She joins forces with Zarok and plans to use her Anubis Stone to change the course of history, turning the tide and helping Zarok win the Battle of Gallowmere . The eventual fate of this incarnation of Kiya is unknown, but her plan is eventually thwarted by Dan.Non-MediEvil appearances PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale  Princess Kiya appears as one of the unlockable minions in PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale.\nShe is unlocked after reaching Rank 8 with Sir Daniel.Quotes Trivia External links Colonel Freddie Fortesque  Colonel Freddie Fortesque is a character in Ghosthunter.Story  After leaving a haunted school building, Lazarus (the game's main protagonist) visits a ghost ship.

In 1878, prior to the events of MediEvil 2, Palethorn and\u00a0Professor Hamilton Kift\u00a0travelled to the Hebrides to locate the last missing pages of Zarok\u2019s spell book. After searching the burial grounds, the spell book was discovered at the Northern part of the island in a tomb. Upon touching the book, the Tomb began to collapse around them. Palethorn abandoned Kift and escaped with the spell book.MediEvil 2  In 1886, Palethorn used Zarok's spell book and unleashed havoc on London. The spell resurrected the dead across the city, including the skeletons of dinosaurs housed in the museum. Because the spell book was missing some of its pages, Palethorn was transformed into a red-skinned demon with elongated ears as a side-effect. Palethorn then set out to find the pages, so he could control the\u00a0zombies he brought back to life. During this time, Palethorn and his assistants, Dogman and Mander\u00a0worked on a machine named the Great Scope at the Greenwich Observatory to instantly locate all the missing pages of the spell book, however his plans were foiled by Dan after he crashed an airship into it. Soon after Palethorn builds Iron Slugger and organizes a boxing match with Kiya as the prize, Iron Slugger is defeated by Dan and his plans are thwarted yet again. Now realizing Dan is becoming more of a nuisance he contacts The Count to help dispose of him whilst he continues his search for the pages. He finally confronts Dan at Cathedral Spires and recovers the last page of the spell book from him. Now obtaining all the pages, he summons a demon to destroy Daniel once and for all. Dan manages to confuse Palethorn's ship into hitting the demon, which eventually led to his defeat. He then uses one last attempt to kill Dan and triggers an explosion, but ultimately fails resulting in his own death. He can be seen in one of the game's endings if the player manages to collect all the chalices, in which Dan and Kiya travel to an alternate time line, where Palethorn used the spell book to travel back in time.Quotes Trivia External links ", "Gamers Fanon Wiki": "Gamers Fanon Wiki Davy Gunfish Biography  There is little known about Davy Gunfish.

Just the long way around. After all, when goods do not cross borders, then armies will.\" -- Lord Samuel Harrington and Pearson Wright Samuel Percivil Aberforth Arthur Harrington is a hardened and very elite EITC Lord. He is, as of today, the current Lord Marshal (leader) of the East India Trading Company, a position he feels able to boast about. His first EITC guild was The EITC's Elite, and then the Black Mercenary's. After that, he created the United Trading Co., and then the Black Officers, then Co. Black Guard and that remains his guild today. He has granted a full pardon to all those loyal to him. but promises death to those who attempt to oppress him. He is a \"Founding Father\" of the Player Made EITC. The others being Giratina Origin Forme, Lord Davy Menace, Pablo Swordmaster, and Nathaniel Scurvyskull. He founded the EITC Council of the Elders and is the current High Elder. He is currently Level 50, and very learned in all skills.Samuel's Early Life  Samuel Harrington was born in 1569 on the island now known as Raven's Cove (he was born on it when it was still known as Emerald Isle) to Jolly Roger and Tia Dalma. He was raised on Raven's Cove, and led a happy and simple life. He lived on a mansion on the higher grounds of Raven's Cove, away from the hustle and bustle of the village below. He made his living fishing, and caught many exotic fish. He sold them for a fair amount. One day, while docking at sea, he saw a ship sailing towards the island, that's when his life would change forever. El Patron stepped foot upon the ground of Raven's Cove, and took many people for his crew. Samuel Redbeard was one of those people. He served El Patron with pride and honor, until he decided to leave for another pirate crew. he sailed with many feared pirates, and eventually changed his name to Redbeard, as that was more pirate-like. One day, while readying the cannons for a raid against Fort Kingshead, a massive Ship of the Line came and attacked thie ship he was on. It was the HMS Victoria, the flagship for the EITC at the time. It killed most of Samuel's Crew, and sunk the ship. Samuel then boarded the Victoria and demanded to speak with the head of the ship. Two EITC Officers took Samuel into the ship's cabin. And there, sitting at a desk, was none other than Lord Cutler Beckett. They discussed terms, and soon came to an agreement. Samuel swore his loyalty to Beckett and to the East India Trading Company, and soon joined them. Beckett's first order of business for Samuel was to kill the remaining survivors from the pirate ship. Samuel did this with ease and without regret, and he knew this was his life's calling.  \ufeffSamuel Today  As of today, Samuel Harrington is leading the Co.

Several members flocked to Viceroyalty Co. the guild grew at a rapid pace.  Viceroyalty Co. also invaded Vachira and set up its Government there.

It includes about 20 guilds and is a republic, It has 2 Co leaders called Consuls which run for reelection every month. On December 21, Royale Knight Co. and Viceroyalty Co decided to unite.

Captian Ryan is a favorite, but does not have much political experience, a deciding factor for nomination. Luuluu is another choice, but some question if he should be eligable because his Main Pirate is not currently in the Alliance. The Gen. of Peace Party is expecting to make major gains, as more members in thier guild have registered to vote. The Royal Party hopes to make some comebacks, and the chance for a Independent to win are greater than ever! Who will win the election! Only time will tell.... -Robert Mcroberts, GuildmasterLeon Returns!  On the day of 1-22-10, Ben Goldeagle showed his face near Fabiola the gypsy! Guess who he is? See picture below. It also turns out, that Captain Leon was never banned, but saw the error of his ways, and stopped playing.Fair Winds!  Hope you learned alot about our guild!

So he decided to make and open The Noob Academy and Learning Center (or NALC).Who We Are  NALC is an organization devoted to the study and education of noobs.Staff Student Roster  This is an area where students will be able to sign up for the next semester,which will be taking place at The Warehouse, Port Royal on days Saturday June 18th, Sunday June 19th It will start at 5:30 Mountain, 3:30 Pacific, and 6:30 Eastern. ENROLLMENT LIST:The Noob Academy and Learning Center Library (NALCR)  This is designed for ALL teachers to write short descriptions of their profession for quick hands-on use.Noobic Behavior  The \"Noob\" will want to befriend other guests of Pirates Online, this will begin to happen more noticeabbly to you once you reach level 40. Depending on your level noobs can actually give you 10 friend requests at once. Founder True Masters must go through hundres of these requests every minute, sometimes by even high levels. Ever wonder why they are all cranky? Now you know.History  The Noob Academy and Learning Center was founded by Edgar Wildratte, to formally study the activity and the programming of how noobs work. Edgar wanted to finally discover what made a noob, a noob. And thus was born the NALCR. It was first a small buisness with 4 original employees: Edgar, Jeffrey Blasthawk, Jay Brightsun, and John Breasly, but now has 27 employees, and growing. The NALC will continue to grow, and function as long as there are noobs around to school, and to study. Unfortunatly with the closure of the game, came the closure of the academy.\u00a0The Definition of the word 'Noob'  Excerpt from English text book chapter one:Introduction A 'Noob' as some people call it, can be many things. It can be: A: A low level player that is annoying and acts like the leader(Depending on attitude of the people and of the person, this could be good or bad) B:Simply an unexpierenced low level player with great promise. C:A slang word for an annoying person D: An insult that is quite unkind and (Quite Regrettebly) used often.Degree of Noob Action(DNA)  The Degree of Noob Action are certain catagories that certain noobs are grouped into. The DNA is not in any particular order. DNA 1: Noob that just recently joined the game. Will not play for very long. Crews whoever they pass DNA 2: Noob that wants to be a leader(and pretends to be one) but cannot because is too low of a level. Basic. Very arrogant. DNA 3: Noob that has no understanding for the game, and its controls(i.e, has no clue how to change servers) DNA 4: An Unexperienced person, but shows great promise. Tries to level up, but often goes after high level enemies. Tries to crew everyone they pass DNA 5: Experienced Noob that is very arrogant, and mean, and tries to attack you. Starts arguements alot DNA 6: Anyone that thinks they are EITC or Navy Rulers DNA 7: Noobs that follow you around where ever you go. Tries to crew everyone they pass DNA 8: Noobs that hang around Abassa Tortuga too much DNA 9: Noobs that get into relationships, and attempt virtual make out sessions. DNA 10: Noobs that kiss-asses to guildmastersTips Research and Studies Edgar Wildrat  First Study: Chair Dude, this guy went into Governors Mansion and started jumping on chairs (really weird) these pictures were taken from my study:End Result  Chair Dude is just an unexperienced noob, best kind because he is only new and not some EITC idiot. He can be helped and he is a good leveler.Conclusion  He won't play the game very long, he is un-experienced and doesn't know how to play.Estimated Time On Game  I give him a week.Experiment N-Lost-Count  I was walking around and a bunch of noobs just appeared. One of them suddenly started yelling \"I'M THE PIRATE KING I DEMAND A THRONE\" the another said \"I AM THE NEW NAVY GENERAL\" then the first noob said \"WHERE IS MY THRONE\" and t he other noob said \"Shut up\" then the first noob said \"Chris, (nnobs name) I reported you.\" then chris went \"Lol, I'm using a laptop\" then he said \"you cant report on a laptop. And thats a fact\" I was very confused. Here is the footage:Jeremiah Stormwash  NothingJeffrey Blasthawk Experiment: N-008-4  Research: Random. While hanging out with my good friend, Captain Johnny, we went noob hunting. We found a classic noob looking for a voodoo doll. \"WHERE U GET VOODOO DOLL\" he says. Afterwards, I predicted:Experiment: N-008-5  Or, \"Chair girl\". Research: Exciting noob, very jumpy. I was in the Governor's Mansion with Edgar and two noobs came in. We agreed that I would get the girl, and hed get the guy. The girl seemed to jump less. This noob went outside after jumping off the walls in the Governors mansion. It went after 1 cadet. She died after three cadets. one by one, i saw the cadet regenerate, and try to kill her. By the third cadet, the girl noob was curious about what would happen if she died, so she stood still, and died... she died... O_o. I even had to heal her. Conclusion: This will probably be her last day online. She had no idea what was going on, and no idea what the controls are with the game.Experiment: N-008-7  Research: I only got to see this guy for a few seconds, but those seconds were weird. I saw a navy cadet RUN before my eyes, after this one level two noob. I could already tell that this noob only hit him once with his cutlass after he took off. Conclusion: Doesnt understand the know-how of the game.Experiment N-008-8  Research: A common noob. Obviously trying to be a leader, and stand out. Of course alot of people, including me, were hating on him for trying to be a bigshot leader. \"Ok, low level people in the back! (EVEN HE IS LOW LVL, AND HE WAS IN THE FRONT) Ok people, invasion time, everyone get tonics, and lets defeat the undead!\" I could have recorded everyone doing that invasion if i wanted to, but this was the worst person. I could have sworn i was the second highest level person doing that invasion! Conclusion: He was unexperienced, and annoying, and hated on. One of the worst kinds of noobs.Experiment N-008-9  I was boredShade Link/Parax Experiment: N-008-2  Research: Not as exciting as my first study, future studies should be better. I was on Invasion Port Royal, Guines, I believe. I was killed, and a random person, later known as Experiment N-008-2, rubbed it in and danced, and did other... things.Experiment: N-008-3  Research: Not that exciting, but better than N-008-2. Screenshots explain themselves. Random Lvl. 1 playing tough guy.Experiment: N-008-9  Research: Slightly more exciting, and entertaining. I was bored on Tortuga, Abassa, so I got into my Noobologist gear, and said it's time to study noobs. A user, known as Silent Munny, said to look at myself. I chose him as my experiment, and tested his responses to various stimuli. Eventually, I simply started saying, \"Cool story bro\". Though his trolling was helpless, he would come back every 5 minutes with more pathetic behavior, even saying he has played for 4 years. He also apparently has 7 Mastered pirates. I have concluded:Experiment: N-008-11  Research: Desperate online dater. Called a girl on the game hot; when she turned him down, he walked up to a girl next to her and hit on her. When told that's being desperate, and that online dating is disturbing, a tantrum was thrown. Conclusion:Experiment N-oob -18  so today i wanted to see a noobs anger, so i went on a unlilimted ship a war firgate and i told him to get a noob on broad and say you drive. So he got a noob on board and said you drive, the noob was happy but i took the wheel and got him mad and he threaten saying ill report you ill kill you ill own you and iam laughing then he said give me the wheel and i said iam to lazy to and he left in a angry mood.Experiment: N-008-13  Research: Attempted to steal my account. Offered to Level me up, then said he needed my username and password. His little scam failed.Experiment: N-008-14  Research: Little level 13 noob. Was found being angry at people for roleplaying. When he attempted to look big and tough, I challenged him to PvP. He backed down, and tried to be more tough now that he was cornered. Ran off, then came back 2 minutes later pretending to beat me with a hammer.Experiment: N-008-15  Research: Sorry for the lack of screenshots. Here is what happened: I sent a PvP and forgot about it. It was accepted an hour later, and a Level 42 known as Morpheus was in it. He hid behind a Tyrant Blade, jumping, and used a glitch to phase through walls. He threw a tantrum when he found I was using Swift glitch (because I didn't remember the PvP). Hypocrite who threw a fit at me for glitching, yet glitched himself. He was using that glitch whenever he was low on health, and used over-powered weapons. Those Weapons are his Tyrant Blade, a Blunderbuss, some strong type of dagger, and a Voodoo Doll. I DID use Doll and marksman weapons, but only for Life regeneration or shattering attunements, as opposed to him using them whenever he was in a wall. He forever has my pity.Experiment: N-008-16  Research: Sorry for the lack of screenshots. This experiment was known as Ravenheart. I found him on Abassa Tortuga. He randomly started attuning me and \"attacking\" with a Sabre. After telling him he couldn't kill me, he started yelling random quotes, such as \"u cant even find the Black Pearl so ur a noob\". I doubt this user is cure-able. Reliaj, please imprison him in the uncureable cell.Experiment N-008-17  Research: Some guy known as Walker, level 39. We had him in our guild for a bit, then I went on his Fishing Boat. I went on a glitch to get off the ship, then started bombing enemy ships, and we started getting loot. Walker wanted to know how to do the glitch. I told him that if I said how, the potco staff would just fix it. He then resorted to begging. When I told him that it would get fixed, he angrily took control of his Boat and sailed away from the ship I was bombing as \"revenge\", then left the guild. He threatens to badmouth Skull's Marines and give us a bad reputation, but I will do whatever it takes to ensure a fitting punishment for him for harassment should he do so.Experiment N-008-18  Research: Sharkman, level 14. I THINK his guild was We Die Together. Asked to drive my ship, I said no, and he threw a tantrum. He was instructed to repair my ship, which was damaged, and he refused. When I started repairing, he grabbed the wheel. I took over, then went back to repairing. He took over again, and I had to grab the wheel again. He then said \"u black\" (obviously referring to my character being black), along with several other insults, and I told him I can get him banned if he keeps them up. Finally, he gave up and left.Experiment N-008-19  Research: Insomniac, level 45. Guild was Emerald Regiment. He challenged me to a PVP, the only rule being \"no Broadsword\". So, since I didn't have the chance to equip Cutlass, I relied on my Dagger. I killed him a couple times, and I admit, I used Swift Foot glitch, but did he prohibit that? No, he didn't. Now, you ask why I mention that. Well, he started making up new rules every time I killed him in an attempt to make the game in his favor, and constantly whining. So, I told him I wasn't going to go by his rules if he was going to whine, so I got Broadsword out. After the fight, he started whining CONSTANTLY, acting like the world was going to explode. I told him to relax and stop acting like the game was real life, and he continued throwing a fit. He challenged me to a rematch, saying anything goes. I won, and, to protect his ego, he started going around saying HE won, and that I was breaking \"rules\", even though there were none. Soon, people joined in and told me about how they dealt with him too. Soon, he started making claims about how he \"gets 5 extra points because I cheated\". He is one of the un-cureable noobs. So, if you come across this guy, don't PVP him, he'll throw a tantrum if he gets killed.Experiment N-008-19  Research: Multiple roleplay \"rebels\": Isaiah, Indigo, and Natalia Niko Sage. They apparently got \"arrested\" by EITC roleplayers, and Indigo started screaming and, according to her, turning into a dragon (o_O). The fight somehow moved from the beach of the French island to the cliff-edge, leading to them screaming in caps random things to the EITC roleplayers, namely \"-KICKS OFF CLIFF-\", \"-BACKFLIPS OVER SHOULDER-\", \"-STABS NO MISS-\", and \"-BLOCK-\" (whenever they got shot or stabbed). Really crazy people, these days\u2026 anyways, these people were just\u2026 weird\u2026 no way to describe just how\u2026 I can't even describe how I feel o_OJay Brightsun Experiment: N-008-10  Research: A nice and friendly level eight. It was my first day on Tortuga Cortevos, so i got into uniform and selected him as my research form. He was on the docks next to a few people and started going sabre wild. I commended him and randomely said \"How Manner\" to decide if he was troll or not. He proved to be no troll, and he attempted to friend me. I denied it, saying i did not know him so well, and he was not troll at all. Research Results: Predictions: Will Prosper in game, might not have too many friends(This is only a prediction because he was sabre - ing all over the place. He probably will grow out of it. Even if he doesn't, he will have friends)Experiment N-008-12  Research: Since it was my second time and i wanted to to a research report once more, i teleported to Port Royal and looked around a while, finally finding a low level pretending to duel another low level. I got into my gear and followed him around, doing various tests. We went into another dark alley and he said for two people to follow him. When he proved to be unresponsive to the tests, i pretended to attack. One of his companions shot at me and i shot back(Not smart), and so they chased me all the way into the Rowdy Rooster, where they abandoned the chase. My report concludes: Research Results: Predictions:Will grow in game into a leader of a guild of some type with good(and loyal) friendsExperiment: Z-1  Research: Mean, level sixteen. Insulted guild, calling us farmers. Me and my friend Charlotte were at kings, abassa, when a low level showed up. He was OK at first, but he eventually got mean. He never turned violent, but he wasn't particularly nice either. We tried to pvp him, but we ended up with other people after he either 1.Didn't accept or 2. The application got lost. I went offline after that. Research Results: Predictions:Will grow to an excellent level, with precious friends(Because force and strength count a lot to people in this game. Go figure.)Medical Teaching File A-2  Research: I am on a strange point of madness. I have learned of a possibility of another sickness(Roleplaying sickness) that occurs in the occurence of when an unlimited player transfers back to a basic. I have named this disease BARF(Biological and Roleplying Foolishness.) It is when a high level can descend into the nature of a Noob. I have this disease now, and it would be best to avoid it at all costs. Cures can be to get access back, and get some crude but powerful weapons and decent clothes to keep self respect. (I'm actually role playing, but this can be a good way to not feel down on yourself. Several people are basic and high level right now and aren't even affected at all, and you know who they are.)Medical Teachng File A-3  Research: Unlimited back, i have made another discovery(ROLE PLAYING Discovery) in this particualr area of science. I have discovered a technical follow - up of BARF. It is when an unlimited player coming out of BARF suffers ruptures of waving stuff about and blowing stuff up. I shall call this FOAM(Followup Of Atrocious Madness) (Remember, you might not go through this, but if you do, it's basically the equivalent of excitement.)Experiment: LV-1  Research: I didnt originally plan to make this an experiment first. It happened when i was kinda bored on Caicos. I had unknowingly teleported to a friend in the Governor's Manison, and some people didn't want me there. I went outside and did the bush glitch. A level one came up to me and started attacking cadets randomily. I began to do so to, to see reaction. HE began to attack the ones I attacked. This proved inconclusive. He tried to do the same glitch i did, and nearly got it, except he mis calculated his trajectory( I like using big words XD) I offered to teach the glitch, and he ran away. I decided to start REAL tests on him. I went \"ROAR!\" and i said weird stuff to see if he would try to tell me to be quiet. He ignored me. Then i pretended to attack, and he did nothing. He went to the shipwright lady and ran around for awhile until he ran off. Research Results: Prediction: Gonna have a great time if he switches to Unlimited, may not if on basic.Lord Robert Experiment: N-345-45  Research: 'Unlimited access noob. I was on Abassa on Padres del Fuego. I found a LV 1 mastered svs infamy! (Hard to believe) and rank 3 pvp infamy. I knew he would make a great experiment and i asked him that is svs and pvp all you do. Henry said that he had unlimited and has used it to master svs and master pvp then going to work on his weapons. Very rare that I found a noob that found\u00a0:D. Anyway i pvp me ( i beat him ) and then i had to leave. He was smart and said he wants to master infamy! Never seen that before but ok in my book Research Results: Predictions: He'll most likey continue within the game and not be a noob for long.Experiment N-456-56  Research: Unlimited access noob. While i was on Tortuga on the Antik server. I found a Lv 1 rank 4 i think svs. Kinda like Experiment N-345-45. He was although acting like a jumper but he just stands in the same spot most of the time whenever I'm on. He's either afk or idk what he be doing. Another rare noob. I asked him to svs and he said: \"Nah to lazy\". He's mainly on Antik. Research Resluts: GalleryProfessor George (John) Breasly Experiment: N008-Level #IGH  Research: What are the reactions of high level noobs to low level noobs when provoked? Approached Ben Squidskull of I N F E R N O, under the alias Mercenaire, and challenged to pvp. He denied, saying he was going to Darkhart, but he stayed on the island for several minutes. I challenged him, saying he was afraid, and he informed me he was a jumper. He did not lose his temper at all. Research Results Above \"say again...\" was Mercenaire challenging him, and saying \"hello?\" repeatedly.Experiment: N0T#IN6  Research: What is the effect of a confrontation over land against a noob? Approached random level two, Pirate, on Tortos, and I claimed I was taking Tortos. He got very angry. A high level came from nowhere and told him I owned it (which I don't). He tried to pvp them all, but didn't say the results.Speech Record  John Breasly: I claim Tortos in the name of The NALC! Pirate: No, I claim it for my guild! John Breasly: Run along, silly boy! Pirate: I'll pvp you for it! I'll beat you SO bad! Brawl: You wanna bet? I'll own you! Pirate: Yeah, let's go, noob! (I left) Results:Experiment: 8I6-N008  Research: I've discovered the new form of Pearson Wright! Not exactly an experiment, I know. Findings:Simon Redskull Experiment: N008-20  Research: What do noobs do when they need help with glitches?.A Noob discovered the Darkhart glitch and was attemping to redo it(he failed) he approached a Game-Master at the Mardi Gras Celebrations and asked for help with the Glitch. Research Results Predictions: He'll spend most of his time whispering to friends 'Can you help me with...'May lose a few friends due to this..Experiement G-001-1  So, i just joined, and i was wondering how to start. I decided that to know more about noobs, i must join their ranks. So, i made a newpirate, a new guild, and waited on welcome server, collecting about 80 noobs in a noob guild (This is a record, i believe.). After this, i sat backand watched. Here is a few things i heard. And many, many more!! Experiment Results: Guild Survival chance: 1% Time estimated until all noobs quit game: 2 monthsExperiment J-SEA-1: Noobs at Sea  I noticed that my colleagues expirements were mainly on land. I wondered how noobs would react to the ocean. I decided to find out. I joined a Frigate captained by the level 18 Mark Keeltimbers. However, I found the Level 5, Pirate, to be more useful for my expirement. She simply stood by the wheel the entire time, doing nothing. At that time, I noticed that the ship was practically SWARMING with noobs. Then the ship ported. I then joined the Light Galleon captained by Freebooter, LV 8. He invited me to his crew, then continued sailing. When he attempted to attack a ship, he misjudged his broadside, and almost completely missed. However, he continued sailing. Conclusion: The bigger the ship, the more likely noobs are to be attracted. Also, when a noob uses his own ship, he is more likely to know what he is doing. In short, noobs that go on other peoples ships are less likely to succeed than those who use their own ships.Experiment J-VRS-1: Are Noobs Contagious?  During my expirement on sea, I wondered if I noobs were contagious. I dubbed the hypothetical virus Noobitus, and then went to the greatest concentration of noobs in the game, which was Cuba. The moment I arrived at Cuba, a noob ran up to me and asked to join my guild. I remained silent, and he ran off. After a few minutes at Cuba, I went to Tortuga. After another half hour of that, I then traveled to Abassa Tortuga. When I joined my fellow high levels, I felt that I had to a.) challenge anyone who argued with anyoen to pvp, b.) invite everyone to a party at the King's Arm for no reason, and c.) invite every high level I saw to invite my guild for no reason. Conclusion: If you let your guard down, you may be infected with Noobitus. Handle noobs with extreme caution.Experiemnt J-AGR-1: Angry Noobs  I noticed that many noobs make people angry, due to the fact that they are so annoying, so I wondered what would happen if I made a noob angry. I found a Lv 2 named Charlette Ironcrash. I said \"Hey\" to her over and over, trying to get her angry. For some reason, she asked if I wanted to date her. I kept saying hey, and she kept asking if I wanted a date. When I asked her where the Voodoo Staff was, she said she didnt. Then she said she did, then ignored me. I can not say this was conclusive, but I can say she did seem a little annoyed. I then found another noob, Ned Cannondougal. I repeated the process, except I also asked about the Voodoo Doll and I asked a lot earlier. Luckily, he didnt ask if I wanted a date, but just said Hey back. Conclusion: Noobs, while they might get slightly annoyed, they will NOT get angry. I hypothesize that this is a self-defense mechanism, for if they were to get angry like other people, they would cause themselves to get angry. This would mean they would be constantly mad, and would never get anywhere. I also hypothesize, that in order to not get mad, they may either become a.) totally extreme, believing that whoever is badgering them wants something totally unrelated, i.e. a date, or b.) noobs will only respond by repeating back what they have heard, devoid of emotion or self thought.Expirement J-RST-1: The Racist Noob. Go Figure.  My Friend, Ben, and I, were just standing behind the shipwright at Cuba, when, out of nowhere, this noob runs out of nowhere and attunes Ben and me. Now, I had an idea so I acted upon it. I told him \"NO! Bad noob! BAD!\" And then the most unexpected thing ever happened... He yelled \"FREK YOU!!\" 0_0 I know, right? Thats when Ben said that this was the same noob that had been following him for a while. But then it got even stranger. While Ben and I were marveling at how this noob could use such language, he then yelled, \"ITS BAD TO BE WHITE WERE ITS GOOD TO BLACK\". Now just a little background, My character is Caucasian, however, Ben and the noob were both African. So i pointed this out to the noob. He just ran off. When I said, \"And he runs off\" he yelled \"THATS GOOD\". Then he came back, slashed me with a sword, and ran off again. Conclusion: This noob is just really, REALLY messed up. Someone needs to teach him about what NOT to say, how to say it, and proper etiquitte about Dolls and Swords.Expirement J-MPS-1: The Impossible: Noobs that are not Noobs  During my previous expirements, I reflected back to my times as a noob. As I thought I realised something, I did not fall into the typical noobish behavior. I rarely ever asked for help when I was a low level, and never bothered anyone. (Note: I am not saying this to be snooty. I SERIOUSLY NEVER asked for help. And I definitly never ran around yelling \"WHERE DO U GET THE DOLL?!\") So, I then theorized that, perhaps, there were some \"noobs\" who were never noobs, and were automatically adjusted to the game, and therefore, acted like a high level. This Expirement is ongoing. If you know any noobs who might help, please contact me on my user page.Experiment WI-N-001  An intriguing noob showed up,and I must write about her. Her name was Kate, a lvl. 7 pirate who had the Sword of Triton, seeing you only needed to be trained to use a sword to wield it. I was planing my first attack on the Queen Anne's Revenge. I had around 11 pirates with me, though most were between level 10 and 20. The ship battle went smoothly, and we started the flagship battle well, but when La Schafe came, most everybody was massacred. Kate was among the dead. I was alive, along with a level 48. The level 48's heart s too soft though, and as I was killed by La Schafe, he desperately tried to revive Kate. I ended up in jail with the stupid level 48. However, we had still one the battle. As it turned out, even tough the lvl. 48 was killed in the middle of reviving Kate, a glitch finished the revival. I had nearly killed La Schafe. Kate took her Sword of Triton, took La Schafe from behind, and actually had killed him single-handedly. It was stunning. Plus, she had kept my ship in perfect shape for me. She was the only survivor, and got all the loot. It was very funny. Conclusion: This case is a Type B noob; she is simply low-level and without experience, but has great promise. She could easily be powerful at lvl. 50.Experiment J-234-1  So this guy was advertising for pvp and Wildshot says hes too low level, and the guys all like \" I'll still own you.\", then Plunderkidd says \"You can't own me.\" and Sympathy X says, \"Nah.\"Experiment J-234-2  So we guilded this guy with the name of noob.Experiment J-234-3  Found another guy with the name of Noob, might be same, Idk. Zoomer's Story I Just Started Online, And I Met A Noob Provoked By A Copied Chuckle And Words Of Her. It Was A Level 7 Baic Access Noob, Who's Temper Earned Quick Provokation. I Copied A Chuckle And Her Word\u00a0: Odd. Then She Randomly Said\u00a0: It's A Fool. To Me. I Said\u00a0: It's A Noob, Back. And Then She Said\u00a0: Later Fool And Barged Onto Her Ship, New Type Of Weird Noob.Experiment LI-POV-001  I will make my section about noobs from a noob's point of view. Unfoutunately, I could not find any noobs to study but I learned a few things: 1. Noobs are usually AFK on a dock. 2. Noobs get knocked out at Fort Charles. 3. Noobs usually run around in circles. I'll try to find some noobs to study.Experiment LI-POV-002  I was in Tortuga in Tortos and I found a noob swinging his sword at an AFK unlimited member, Orinda Le Jeune, and Horatio Fowler (dockworker). I swung my sword once and he started swinging at me, then he left quickly.Results  Some noobs are sword crazy &amp they swing at inanimate object or people more than playersExperiment LI-POV-003  I tried that test to see if noobs get angry and I did it to these noobs same level as me. Noob #1 didn't do anything I even said YO, ARR and BEEF at one point. Nothing. Noob #2 told me to stop, so I did. Conclusion: Some noobs do get annoyed if you bother them.Experiment NR-REV-001 - Displaced Noobs  This is my first project as a noobologist, and right now I am researching how noobs would react to being displaced in an unknown territory ( Ex. Tormenta, Perdida, etc ). I ran into a noob in Cursed Caverns the other day, getting downed by a group of seabeards near the treasure room. I picked him up, and I noticed how he attempted to run past the enemies. He was then downed again. I picked him up again, and I cleared the path for him. He got past the enemies as they spawned again. He then tried to run past the enemies AGAIN, and got downed. I left him after that. Conclusion: Commonly displaced noobs will lose all train of thought and will wander aimlessly until finding a way out. This is probably a self-defense mechanism. Estimated Time in game - probably 2 or 3 months, he was a lvl 18 unlimited. Time left in game - estimated to be 1 or 2 more months. Overall: He did speak, and was very friendly, but seems to lose common sense when in unknown territory.Experiment NR-REV-002 - UA Noobs  Although there are few cases of unlimited access noobs, many do exist. Most UA noobs, however, are very isolated and act as if they are better than you. This is Experiment NR-REV-002, AKA, Bill, looking for attention. Please note that I am on my low level pirate, Plundermonger. Conclusion: He is friendly, but seems to act hostile towards lower levels. Also very confused. Estimated game time left - 4 to 5 months.Jason Yelloweagle  I will make sure I can tell you everything I learn about noobsExperiment JY-AEM-001 Noobs at sea.  This is my first noob experiment. I decided to see what would happen when I put my light galleon on public. At first nothing happened. About 5 minutes in I was about to give up when a lvl 3 noob appeared. I was very excited and just watched. At first he went to the cannons and tried to shoot at the far off enemy ships. Then he came up to the wheel and stood beside me (I had the wheel just to see what would happen) then all of a sudden he whispers (the noob form of talking) \"MOVE\" I don't respond then he says \"MOVE\" again. Then he says \"I'm gonna get my friends to make you move\". I just kept holding onto the wheel. I was looking at the number of people on board which was still the same when all of a sudden the noob whispers \"There he is guys move him!\" At this I just started laughing so hard my cat even looked at me. After a few more minutes of him whispering \"Come on guys move him!\" He just left. I then ported and went back to my normal life. Conclusion: Does not have any real friends yet so has made up imaginary friends to keep him company, gets very aggressive if not given what he wants. Estimated time in game: 1\u20133 days Estimated time left in game: 1 monthAlbert Spark Experiment N008-01-AS  This is my first noob encounter. When I was on Padres Del Fuego a max Unlimited Access ran into me and decided I was a perfect candidate for his guild when he whispered to me if I wanted to join. Although there is nothing nooby enough about it I asked him What it was about. When he replied he said,\"U think ur all that? That sad bro rofl\" and put a musket in an... \"area\" and began his perviness and invited in his \"men\" to harass me. Conclusion: He is forever alone and has no good friends or a mentor and has decided to take up the art of pevertedness. Estimated time left in game: 1 - 6 Months as he may get banned within that time Estimated time in game: 1 YearZeke Experiment H1GH-L3V3L-N008-1  7/9/12 Yesterday I met a rare high level noob! He was level 45 and he walked up to me and asked where the Dead Man's Chest is. I replied saying there is no Dead Man's Chest because the game takes place between the first and second movies. He asked again and I replied the same. He told me to stop joking with him. I told him I was not and again he told me to stop joking with him. I finally got him to believe me and he asked me to level with him. I said yes and joined his crew. I asked him if he knew where Isla Tormenta was and he said no. I took him there and leveled with him. Conclusion: Probably a new player using a friend or older brother's account. I guess that his is at the maximum 8 years old. He kept making typos and used improper grammar numerous times.Experiment ST4LK3R-N008-1  5/11/13 Today I met a noob named Amelia Heartcloud. She was level one. Amelia wore a gray cap and a sash and the default clothes shown when nothing is worn. I was talking to my friend and Amelia just walked up and started staring at me. I ignored the wretch at first but then I moved and she stood in front of me, just staring at me. I stared her down for about 3 minutes and started using the roar and angry emotes. She just started dancing. After 5 minutes of watching her dance I began trying to talk to her. Finally I stated, \" I don't think it can talk,\" to my friend, at which point Amelia pulled a sword on me. I turned my back and she ran away and continued to stare at me from a distance. Conclusion: Could actually talk. Just wanted to mess with me. By choice of clothes and behavior I estimate this is an immature 8-10 year old. My generalization was that they were just trying to be annoying.Christopher Ironshot C- N -008-AN  Much like N-008-13 except it was a level 1 noob, basic access, He said, I will level you for free, I refused, later when I came on, I found that my Sword of Triton was gone with a few of my famed. My Findings\u00a0: Hacker. Tried to do it without using a hacker program first. Time in game\u00a0: I give him another day.C-N-008-AC  Little Unlimited Access noob, Level 50, Broadsword happy. Kept at it, for I think 10\u201315 minutes, kept screaming \"WHY WON'T YOU DIE?!?!?!?!? Pathetic, 7 year old behavior. Findings: Used a older brother's account or a older friends account. Time left in game\u00a0: I can't say, because, honestly, I don't know.C-N-008-AH  So I was looting with a friend with a friend in El Patron's Mines, with a friend, O'Rage. I found a version of Pearson Wright, much like experiment 8I6-N008 the noob also said when we asked are you Pearson Wright of Casa Di Royale? He said You are a waste of my time. ( CENSORED! ) you! Me and O'Rage just burst out laughing that a noob could use language like that. Findings\u00a0: Definantly Pearson Wright AKA Pears and was reported, may get banned. Time left in game\u00a0: Until he gets banned\u00a0:PC-N-008-AA  Extra Research on the \"Noobs that aren't Noobs\" in experiment J-MPS-1 Status\u00a0: OngoingProfessor T. Crossbones  I study the way a noob acts when provoked or bothered.Study TC-N008-1  It is 3:00 A.M. where I am and I was really bored. I was just about to go offline when I see some noobs by Gunpowder Sam on De Porc. I spammed their whisper with \"hi\". After this they started talking in a language that is probably not english.Study TC-N008-2  Same candidates as Parax's N-00-8 19, it happened 2 hours before Parax and the EITC arrived. I was training my men at that camp next to the beach when Isaiah and his noob friend Percy J. came. Isaiah said \"This camp is for Alpha Strikers!\" I responded with \"Actually it's an online game, you don't 'own' anything.\" He then said \"Spain declares war on Armed Guard!\" I said \"ROFL Spain is already at war with Armed Guard, do explain, why are you speaking for spain if you are in a british guild?\" He then said \"Well Alpha Strikers declare war on Armed Guard!\" I responded with \"ok\" and started continuing the training. Realizing that he couldn't win the argument he said \"Alpha Strikers! Lets go to Avaricia!\" Indigo was afk at this time and when she got back the men were taking a break. She came up to me and said \"Can I join your guild? and can I join training?\" I told her she could and i guilded her. We trained a bit when we saw some noob on the cliff above us. Isaiah and his noobs came back too and Indigo started saying in guild chat \"Isaiah is my life\" and \"tell isaiah that i love him\" I ignored her completely and so did the rest of the guild. I then went afk and when i got back Parax and the EITC where there with Isaiah and his noobs. I asked what was going on and Parax said an arrest. I saw Percy J. running around and generally acting stupid. I witnessed the whole fight tha was described in Parax's N-00-8 19 study.Study TC-N008-3  I was running around Tortuga Abassa looking for someone my level to PvP. I came across a level 11 noob\u00a0 bothering a level 50 girl. I joined her crew and asked what happened. She said that she had friended the noob, called Dracakool, and when he had disrespected her, she unfirended him. Now he was going around telling her to friend him or leave. He insulted her calling her a old lady and... other things. Finally I stepped in and told him to stop or to PvP me. He responded by saying \"rofl tyler your just jealous\" I then said, \"Why would I be jealous of a level 11 who thinks he has followers.\" He ignored me and declined PvP. He then started to go up to random girls and stand \"close\" to them and say \"Oh, you like that baby\" and \"Sorry, got to go. Sharing is caring\u00a0;)\" He would\u00a0 then go up to some other girl and do the same thing.Study TC-N008-4  Alright, LOL I don't even know who to explain this. I was on Abassa by the bonfire, and suddenly this girl comes\u00a0 up to me and says \"Do you want to own me?\" I was like ROFL in chat.?Physician Blue  I study noobs since of their ignorance, I plan to decrease the noob population so the game can run smoothley with experienced players.\u00a0Study of The Noob-1  I was just strolling along Raven's Cove Abassa thinking I would do a regular Smasho raid, until \" Pirates \" started the situation. He was walking then found me, and tried to friend me. I said yes thinking this guy might have a good sense of socialization but he was DEAD SILENT. He followed me to the cave, I tried to show him my skills by killing some fire bats. I said \" here for the show? \" thinking this guy might like to see enemies die. He responded with \" My Gold \" and tried to shoot them, he almost died. I quickly killed the enemies before they could munch on him for dinner. I went into the cave, and changed my options since my graphics were a little glitchy. The little guy continued on into the Smasho area. He attempted to attack the ghost, died, I revived him and he said his three and last words \" Help, Thank You, \" he attacked with this other guy is probably also a noob. The other guy or noob is Jim, Jim makes himself a noob by attacking Smasho ALONE. He then died, the little guy attempted to revive him but Jim just stormed out by clicking on the Go To Jail button. Jim never returned after that. So I'm with my noob, who walks up to a ghost, probably just does the hack maneuver and stands there blank. The ghost knocked a mere 9/10 of the guys health and he then just quit the game. Annoyed I left his list and discovered that he was a noob.\u00a0 The noob: Pirates, is found to hold DNA #4 & 7. The noob: Jim, is found to hold DNA #4.Classes Math  Learning the speedchat plus numbers (won too tree for ive ix/sick sven ate fine/vine/pine tin)History  Self-explanatoryEITC Class  Class to convert EITC into normal peopleEnglish  Teaching what to say (example dont say: IM JACK SPARROW!)Know-how  Learning game basics (example: what a flagship is)Want to join?

It is lead by General David. It was made when Pearson Wright needed a unit to stop the EITC from attacking pirates, so he made The Republican Guard. The plan was to destroy all the EITC bases. No girls in service. If you go into service, you get payed some gold once a week. The Republican Guard is still fighting today.

Thomas Owsley had immigrated from England a meare Four years earlier, since then he had been given command of a small detachment of state Militia, and had accumulated 650 acres of land to his name. His detachment of men was assigned to defend the Rappahannok River from Native American Attacks. On the 8th of June in 1682, Native Americans attacked Thomas Owsley's Plantation. The Native Americans set fire to the fields, and attacked the house directly. Thomas had a few men over for a night of Gambling when the attack began. They all grabbed muskets and rushed outside. There were five of them against twenty Native Americans. They skirmished for a few minutes with the Natives, until they left. One of Thomas' buddies was mortally wounded, and another two had small wounds. This would have major effects on Robert's life. Thomas felt life in the Colonies was much to dangerous for his son. Robert, along with his Great Uncle William Harris, who was sent with him to keep him safe, boarded a boat for England. Robert arrived at a small town in Somerset county named Stoguersey, he lived with his family there, and eventually became a novice surveyor. When he was fourteen, he set off to make his fourtune in London.Years in London\ufeff  When Robert arrived in London, he had almost nothing to his name, except he was the son of the Colonist. With what little money he had, he scraped together enough money to get himself a small wharf in London Harbour. He conserved his money well, and within Three years began a newspaper, the London Manifest, which became immensly popular, Robert began saving, and planned to make a Journey back to the Province of Virginia and meet his father. On night in a tavern, he met a bloke by the name of Captian Ryan who offered a ride to the New World. He gathered a crew and he and Robert set sail for Virginia in 1701, however, as they were exiting the Thames River, a British Warship approached, by order of the King all merchant vessels capable of Navy service were to be taken. There was a Succession dispute over the throne of Spain, and it had just erupted into war. Robert Owsley would not be leaving Europe for a good while longer.The War of Spanish Succession  Robert, after seeing the glory won by officers in the Army, decided to enlist. In 1704 at the age of 24, Robert was named a captain in the British Artillery. His first taste of combat was the bloody Battle of Blenheim. France had prepared an Army, which could achive the Conquests of the scale of Alexander the Great, and leave a legacy and control as long as Rome. France and her allies marched into the Holy Roman Empire. French, Spanish and Bavarian Troops squared off against a smaller Army of British, Dutch, Prussians, and Hessians. He skillfully directed his Artilley in support of his troops, but when Commander John Furgeson, who was in charge of an Infantry Regiment, died, Robert was thrust into his position as all other officers who outranked him were dead or in a very important position. As Robert took command, The Bavarians and French were launching an attack under Duc de Tullard. Most of the left flank was fleeing from the filed, and Robert desperatly attempted to hold them together. Only the Hessian Mercenaries remained, Robert would come to have great admiration for them. Robert reorganized his soldiers and launched a massive counterattack. Just as he was pushing the French back, a bullet struck him in the shoulder, he would be in bedridden for several months because of this, however, the English and Hessian soliders destroyed the French left and outflanked them, causing the army to rout. Robert would be given a position as Lieutenant Colonel, and he would fight in Spanish Flanders and the Low Countries for the greater portion of the War, gaining experience commanding infantry as well as Cannon. When it concluded, he was hailed back as his towns Hero. In 1714, after the wars conclusion, he set sail for the New World, however this voyage would not go as planned.Adventures in Algeria The Voyage to the Caribbean gone Wrong.  Robert's Ship, The Diadem, headed Southwest, towards the Port Royal, Jamacia, where his Ship was going to ressuply then head to the Province of Virginia. A few days into the Voyage, disaster struck. Events that would lead to this had been building up for years in the Barbary Coast of North Africa. North Africa was home to many Muslim Pirates, who would prey on the shipping of European Nations, and take the sailors and passengers as slaves. They offered to stop this, however if the European Nation would pay a certian sum of money every year. The War of Spanish Succession had forced these payments to be ended so they could be used for the War effort. As a Result the Barbary Pirates began preying on English shipping once more. Up Until 1714, the English Medditeranian and Atlantic Fleet which had been blockading French and Spanish ports, had also protected the Merchant vessels. Now that the War in Europe was over, the Pirates took advantage of the lack of the English Warships and began a horrific reign of terror on the English Merchant vessels.Robert as a Slave  The Diadem\ufeff was confronted by a Ship in service of the Bey of Algeria. Soon, she was boarded by the Pirates. The crew put up a valiant resistance, but was forced into the Lower decks. Robert Owslley and his crew surrendered to the Pirates. They were boared onto the Pirate's Ship and were forced to watch the Diadem be burned and sink. Robert Mcroberts was taken to the slave Markets of Algeris, where he was sold as a Slave. He was forced to work in the heat for many long days, until he and his fellow Englishmen who had just became slaves made a Genious plan. In the middle of the night, he and his fellow Slaves, snuck into thier Masters room. The used thier chains to tie the master to his bed posts, then they slipped out of the farm.The Great Escape  Robert and his fellow escapee's had devised a daring plan to get back home. They would travel by Land, to the Spanish City of Melila, which was on the shores of North Africa. Then they would use money they toke from thier master in Algeris, to buy for transportation to Algericras in mainland spain. Then they would walk a few miles to the recently won British Possesion of Gilbraltar. The Treaty of Uterct, which ended the War of Spanish Succession, awarded England the Rock of Gilbraltar, one of the most defensive and valuable places in the world. Robert and the Escapee's would then use connections in Gilbraltar to get a ride back to England and freedom. The plan was darring enough, without the fact that they would be hunted down. For Several weeks they evaded capture, but while they were outside of the City of Oran some men approached them. They claimed they had an arrest warrent for him, but Robert attempted to fool them that they were Spanish Merchants, however, Roberts Accent gave him away.Back to England  Robert and the rest of the Outlaws were taken to Prision in Algeris. Their old master had died, and they waited in Prison until they would be sold of to new different masters. One day while waiting in Jail, the Jailkeep came up and open his cell. He had in his hand a Letter and a pouch of Gold. The Citizens of Stoguersey had Ransomed Robert back. Robert was shocked, and at first could not believe it. He eventualy went with the Jail keeper and boarded a ship for England. The moment he arrived, he used what money he had left in England to make an Mercenary Army. He hired men from Austria, England, Ireland, Prussia, Spain, France and even a few from Sicily. In 1716 he aquired the Ship, HMS Warrior, and set sail for Algeris.Robert Meets the Bey of Algeris  Robert and his band of Mercenaries landed in the Harbour of Algeris. None expected an Amphibious attack like that. Robert and his Mercenaries headed for the Jail he had been kept in. When he arrived, he found none of his fellow escapee's and interregated a new Jailkeeper. He said that they had been sent off to do work in the Bey's Minefields in the Atlas Mountains. Robert was furious and threw the Jailkeeper to the ground. The Jailkeeper then chuckled, \"I bet most of them are dead\". Robert Lost it. He pulled out a Flintlock pistol and shot the Jailkeeper in the side. The Jailkeeper would die a slow agonizing death. Robert soon with his band of Mercenaries rushed towards the Bey's Palace. They burst in and killed all of the Bey's guards. Robert held the Bey at gunpoint, ready to end his life, when the Dey begged for mercy. Apparently, Roberts friends had not been killed, but were working at a Drydock in Constantine. Robert set down his Pistol and began to talk with the Bey. They soon reached an agreement of what would happen next.The Treaty of Algeris (1716)  -All English Slaves would be released from Algeris -The Algerians would never attack English Shipping again, or face destruction -Payments will resume -A Trade Agreement will be made -Simmilar offers would be granted to other European Nations The Proposal was approved by the Dey, and was sent to Parlament in London. Many in Parlament did not want to resume the high payments. There was a vocal minority who had family enslaved, they supported Roberts Proposal to a great degree. The vocal minority told false reports of torture and murder, and got most of the Citizens on thier side. This changed the opinions of many members of Parliment, because they would need votes in the upcoming election. The Proposal approved Parlament and went into effect. Robert was promised to be Knighted for his Actions by the King, and was granted alot of Gold to make his Journey to the new world. He also recieved a Sword from the Crusades, the Sword of St. John. Even though he was a Catholic, he was much respected by the Protestant Government.The Voyages to the New World and why Robert Commited Treason  After his Successful return to England, Robert again boarded a ship for the New World, HMS Dauntless. This time, his ship made it to Port Royal, Jamacia. The Dauntless, toke supplies and soon left for Williamsburg, Virginia. Robert, when arriving at his fathers plantation, found it in possesion of his brother, Thomas Jr., apparently Robert's Father had died 3 years ago. Robert was devestated by this and in sadness, once again sailed back home for England. Robert was greeted by the King personally, and the knighting ceremony took place. As it was about to be concluded, the King said Robert had to deny the practice of Transubstantiation, a core Catholic belief. Unknown by Robert, the former King, James II, that last of the Catholic Kings had returned from Exile in France. With supporters in Catholic Ireland and Scotland, he raised a massive army to retake the throne. They were defeated by the supporters of the King. Public Opinion was greatly against Catholics, and Parliament passed a new Bill, which required all holders of a royal title or public office, deny the practice of transubstantiation, to prevent Catholics from recieving Titles or Offices. As soon as the King said this, Robert walked out on him. Robert's faith mattered more than being a Knight. The King was furious, and later ordered Robert Mcroberts to be arrested, but he was too late. Robert had boarded another ship for the new world. With the Intentions of moving his Family to the Catholic friendly colony of Maryland.Robert the Outlaw  Robert reached his brothers plantation in a few weeks. When he arrived, there was a note on the Plantations door. The British Army contingent had arrived a few days early and taken his Family hostage. Robert knew that he would be killed or his family would if he agreed to the King's demands. Robert out of options did the insane. He went to Baltimore, and hired a group of thieves, thugs and bandits and a Priest. He offered his gang a good deal of money to help him take down the British ship which took his family. He asked the Priest to come and guide him through his Journey. Robert had heard from other sailors in the Tavern that the Ship needed to stop in British Senegambia to take some more hostages. Robert hired a merchant vessel armed with 48 cannon. Robert sailed directly across the Atlantic in Hurricane season and caused some damage to his ship. Nevertheless, he encountered the British ship of the coast of La Coruna, Spain. They attacked in the dark of night, and got next to the British ship undetected. Robert ordered the ship to boardside, then grapple hooks were thrown onto the British ships decks. The crew boarded the ship swifty and after losing 3 men, took control of the Entire ship. Robert's Family was transfered to Robert's Ship, and the question remained of what to do with the rest of the crew. Some of the men wanted them killed, but Robert's Priest, Father Harris, advised against this. Robert decided to let the Sailors return to England, so they could tell of Robert's Victory. Robert then took his family to Lisbon, Portugal. Portugal was the last Catholic nation to tolerate the English, so it looked like a Promising place for Robert to have his family stay.A Change of Names and Destiny  After Robert Settled his family in Portugal, he felt he needed to change his last name. This would be neccessary to make sure his family is ever associated with him again for thier own safety. He changed his name from Robert Owsley to Robert Mcroberts. Robert Mcroberts would become a common name all over Europe, for he had taken down a British warship. Robert Mcroberts, sailed back to the New World, having to fend off British Ships. When he arrived back in Baltimore, he used wealth he had captured, to buy a new ship for preying on English War Vessels, he named it the Victory Voyager.The Terror of the 11 Colonies  In The Winter of 1717 Victory Voyager needed to find a home port. The Spanish offered to provide a dock and warehouse at St.Augustine, in return for Mcroberts and his crew to Terrorize Englands colonies in America.The Province of Carolina  The Victory Voyager had her hull repaired, refitted her cannons and recruited a larger crew. They set sail north, into the waters of the Province of Carolina. They fast approached the Capital of Carolina, Charles Towne. They attempted to pillage the town, but Cannonfire from its fort prevented them from entering the Harbour. The crew then chose a smaller, but easier to take target, the adminstrative center of Northern Carolina, New Bern. After about a week, they arrived outside of the small town. In the middle of the day, the attacked the defensless town. Robert and his men came off the ship and stormed the town. By the end of the day, Roberts forces toke the town. The Colonial Government at Charles Towne, offered 500 Gold Coins for the return of New Bern. Robert agreed, but after the loot was safely aboard his ship, he fired fireshot into the town and set it ablaze. However, he did warn the townsfolke to get out of thier homes before nightfall.The Province of Virginia  After the sack of New Bern, the Victory Voyager headed north to the wealthiest of the Colonies, and Robert's Homecountry, the Province of Virginia. The Victory Voyager slowly crept up the coast, and sailing into the undefended Chespeake Bay. Robert and his men made Williamsburg, the Capital of the Province of Viriginia, its target. The Ship sailed up the James River, but met fierce tides. This allowed the Virginian Government to set up Cannon around the Hog Island, a bend in the river. Not wanting to risk damage to his ship, Robert turned around, and began sacking small river towns on his way back into the Chesepeake Bay. The Virginian Government sent 5 Fifth Rate Ship of the Lines after Robert. It became relevant that Robert would need a larger crew and more ships, he sailed to the only Colony sympathetic to him, the Catholic Province of Maryland.The Province of Maryland  The Victory Voyager sailed for all its worth towards Maryland. His goal was to make it to Baltimore and hire some ships to help him fight. In order to slow down the British Ships, Robert had some of his men disembark with 4 cannons, and placed them in the woods outside of Annapolis. When the British ships approached the concealed Cannons open fired. The British feared opening fire on the woods, so they landed some soldiers to evict the cannoneers out of the Forest. The Fighting in the forest was fierce, and the British had to return to thier ships because nightfall came soon. The Next morning, Robert's men with support from the locals had made earthworks, and proved hard to dislodge. The British had to surround the forest, which forced Robert's men to surrender, a week had passed. Robert had arrived in Baltimore and immediatly began hiring a crew, and enlisted the help of an Irish ship captian who had immigrated to Maryland. His ship was a Galleon called the Fighting Conqueror. With what little money he had left he hired the service of two Light Frigates, the Red Mercenary and the Blue Mercenary. He had the Victory Voyager and the Fighting Conqueror take up postions outside of Baltimore, while the Blue and Red Mercenaries hid in an area known as the \"Eastern Bay\". The British force sailed after the Victory Voyager and the Fighting Conqueror, but were unaware of the light frigates. The Light Frigates soon came out of the Eastern Bay and fired Firebrand at the sails of the British Fleet. All of the British ships would premenantly lose thier Mobility. Roberts Ships were able to circle around them and destroyed or captured them all. A notable Prisoner was John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlbourough, who Robert served under at the Battle of Blenhiem. Churchill had been traveling to meet family in Carolina, but his ship was comondeered into service. However, the British badly wanted there war hero back, so they British decided to negotiate at Dover, or atleast, thats what Robert thought they would do....The Province of Delaware  The Victory Voyager soon sailed towards Dover, leaving the rest of the fleet behind, passing again through the Province of Virginia. As a sign of goodwill, they dropped John Churchill of at Williamsburg. Then the Victory Voyager sailed out of the Chesepeake bay into open waters once again. Meetings with the British were to take place in Dover, Delaware. Delaware was named after Robert's Sixth Cousin, Four times removed, Baron De La Warr. Robert's ship was reserved a dock at Dover, and Robert and his First mate Richard Crestbaine met with the British in the fort defending the Harbour. The British there shocked Robert, they said the King had agreed to a special deal. Robert would be given a Ship of the Line to be his ship and he would work as a Privateer for the Crown, Robert would also be knighted without having to deny Constubstantiation. Robert was Suspicious, but agreed to meet with the King, on the condition he could take some of his crew. As they were on the boarding ramp, a Cadet shouted \"Ready the Cells, we have Prisoners onboard!\". The Cadet soon cuped his mouth, but it was too late. Robert and his bodyguard knocked a few Cadets and a guard into the water then ran for thier lives. After 2 days of fleeing, they arrived in New Castle. The Blue and Red Mercenaries had arrived and Robert began the plan to retake the Victory Voyager, and free his men from prison. At night, Robert and his men took over a British rowboat and put on Royal Navy Uniforms, they boarded the ship and began to take over. During the fighting a barrel of Gunpoweder was hit with a a bullet and a portion of the lower deck was knocked off. Robert sent the Victory Voyager to Philidelphia to pose as a Merchant ship which got attacked by the French and needed repairs. Robert and the Rest of the fleet headed for New Jersey.Matthew Fireskull  Note: He wont be online for another.............. 4 months He has 30 Famed Weapons and 4 Famed Weapon.

He is very angry alot of the time, and only finds happiness during the bitterness of war. Although he posseses great leadership skills (he was at one point a Sergeant in the Royal Marines), he is very insubordinate and was demoted for his actions against his superiors. He has a hatred of authority, and is very independent usually to the point of animosity. He is the type of man you want on your side during a fight, and is extremely well-suited for war.Quotes Family  Father:\u00a0??? Mother:\u00a0??? Uncle:\u00a0??? Aunt:\u00a0???

I've been trying to send this message through for a while, but every time I tried to publish it it wasn't there on your Talk Page. You Know Who  Am....Help.  Could you speak to Bator about his behavior? I confronted him about something he said about me, and he said: You really did not know that your polls went up because I asked half my friends to vote for you? I voted for you on User:Bator.hos, and my wikia contributor account. I tried, but you just got elevated to top on my List Of Wiki Jerks.

With hate, NeverSayNever Please help.--Shade 23:40, April 10, 2011 (UTC)Question  I have a small question. But first... I was on Potco, and at some point Matthew O'Malley spoke to me, asking if I could help him. He would like one last chance to work here again. He has truly given in, and I found myself agreeing with him. I think he's changed, and I would like the Administrators to vote on this. He's a good guy now. I've hanged out with him for a bit on Pirates online, and I found him as a good guy who has changed. I don't want people to take this the wrong way, I just think he's a good person and deserves one last chance. Everyone deserves a chance. Take me for example. I used to act a little bit like O'Malley on the first Wiki I worked on back in 2009. I completely regret how I acted on that. I have a dark past with one specific Wiki, hated by the users of it, but I came from a noobish person to a very mature person. Perhaps people can look at O'Malley one last time and give him the chance that I was given on other wikis. Just in case someone gets the wrong idea of what I just said, I'm not O'malley, I just think he's changed. So, my question... Can we all give him one last chance? --Shade 19:22, April 16, 2011 (UTC)IDEA  there should be a article of the year\u00a0:DMain page  Jzf decided that we don't need the rollbacks on the main page.

They seem to be on at the exact same time, Xilef only seems to support James, James seems to edit his page for him... and a few other reasons. I have trouble explaining, but I recommend somebody looks at their contributions... The accounts seem suspicious... Furthermore, check his contributions, everything he does is provocative (see below), and when given advice, he pretends to be invincible (or at least it seems like that), and uncooperative. What I see when I look at him is a troll looking for a fight with users like John Breasly and Samuel Redbeard. Please stop this child. Also, (the following is not saying he's a sockpuppet)James seems to acknowledge that John is angered by his claims (\"I'm your ruler, I'm king\", etc.), yet though he knows, he keeps doing so, as if he's trying to provoke another fight.--Shade 16:03, April 19, 2011 (UTC)Inappropiate Image  Another one:Video Snapshot of xorableemmyx-2.jpeg  I suggest you delete it as soon as possible.

He thinks he owns pages on the wiki, and keeps acting like a big-shot. He also has shown to constantly target Capt. Skull X for trolling. When I stood up for Skull, he targeted me, and further showed his hostile behavior. I am requesting a block on this pathetic little child.

You and Shadow are causing too much drama. I'm sorry to hear your dad is dead, but that does not justify your rudeness. If Shadow is annoying you, he's probably not doing it on purpose. Just ask him politely, like, \"Hey, Shadow, your kinda bugging me by doing/saying that. Not trying to be rude, but can you please stop?\" Or, just put him on ignore. Your both acting childish. Don't even bother to reply, unless your promising you'll start doing what I said above, about asking politely. A message has also been sent to Shadow.

Well, then you have chromatic scales where you basically hit every note in the universe by using sharps (when ascending) and flats (when descending).

Men, destroy this profane temple!\"A Note from the Publisher  EDIT I know. You're mad. You think to yourself \"will this guy just make up his mind? He's changed his story a million times!\" Well, I thought so, too. But then, I realized that this story would go too far out of my ACTUAL in game story, which is what I promised you in the story. I have lied, and for that, I apologize. I promise, I have made up my mind. Now, sit back, relax and enjoy my incredibly short and choppy third-person story. It started in the year 1715 on a small Spanish island, Isla De La Avaricia. A young man named Roberto Moreno was preparing a meal for his very poor family, when a group of Spanish soldiers stormed into the house, took Roberto away from his family, and placed him in a boot camp. There, he was forced to train for years to become a Spanish soldier. However, one year, he received word that his entire family had been killed by a horrible disease. In rage, he vowed he would become a holy soldier, under the Spanish Crown of Ferdinand, and for God. CADIZ, SPAIN 7 YEARS LATER...

He is the primary representative of the Bomberman people, who became the dominant inhabitants of Planet Bomber. Like every other Bombermen, he has the ability to generate bombs. There are many incarnations of him represented in the different games of the series, which do not usually keep a consistent description of the character. He is often saving his home planet, the galaxy, or even the universe from disaster. He is also nicknamed Shiro Bom, which has been translated as \"White Bomber\" starting with the GameCube games and localized as \"Cheerful White\" in the English releases of the Bomberman Land series. Occasionally, this is further shortened to simply \"Shiro\" in the Japanese versions.Biography  In the home computer game Bomber Man (1983) and its second edition 3-D Bomberman (1984), \"Bomber Man\" (as his name was originally parsed) was depicted as a human with overalls, a visible mouth, hair, and a white hat with a red feather. In the Famicom/NES Bomber Man (1985), the hat was swapped with a helmet and antenna, and he was given a blue suit with white and pink limbs. He also had a white horizontal stripe on his back, which was replaced with a black belt in subsequent appearances. This is actually a palette swap of the enemies seen in the 1984 Hudson Soft port of Lode Runner, but this appearance has more or less remained constant in the series. The background given in the console game begins with the eponymous character having grown tired of making bombs in an unnamed underground empire and deciding to escape after hearing a rumor that a robot can become human. The ending features the miraculous transformation into his \"Runner\" identity which serves as a prequel to the 1983 Lode Runner, also suggesting that the story involved the recurring Bungeling Empire from early Br\u00f8derbund products. As Lode Runner, he is a famous Galactic Commando tasked with evading the empire's guards and reclaiming stolen gold, and in the 1985 direct sequel Lode Runner's Rescue, his daughter Alexandra has to save him after his capture. Both franchises have since mostly moved in separate directions, but loose references remain in later titles. In the TurboGrafx-16 game, Dr. Mitsumori uses Bomberman as the model for subsequent lifelike Bomberman robots, and the time period is stated to be sometime in the future (specified to be the late 21st century in the arcade game). In Bomberman '93, he is shown to be a \"Bomber Cop\" detective who upholds the peace of the galaxy, and Bomberman '94 establishes the main setting as Planet Bomber rather than Earth. Saturn Bomberman introduces a benevolent human scientist named Dr. Ein, who takes an advisory role in certain missions. Bomberman Hero introduces Bomber Base, a headquarters on Planet Bomber where he trains diligently. More recently, the Bomberman Jetters video game (a follow-up of sorts to Bomberman Generation) names his organization the Jetters, but that might only be pertinent to the Jetters anime. Bomberman's arch-nemeses are Bagura and Mujoe, and his rivals include his friend Max and foe Regulus. His original enemy was Black Bomberman, but he reformed after the two allied in Super Bomberman.Personality  White Bomberman is usually portrayed as the heroic, upbeat, yet cheerful and jolly type, but sometimes goofy, all too willing to make friends with people he had once considered enemies. His bright, kind spirit and courage are greatly appreciated by others. He never holds back while fighting and focuses a lot on training to be the strongest warrior ever.Anime  He has featured in three anime series: Bomberman B-Daman Bakugaiden, Bomberman B-Daman Bakugaiden Victory (based on the marble shooting game B-Daman) and Bomberman Jetters. Each of these introduced their own characters, and contain mostly different takes on the series.Bomberman B-Daman Bakugaiden IV & V  White Bomber\u00a0(Shiro Bom)\u00a0is the main protagonist in Bomberman B-Daman Bakugaiden\u00a0and\u00a0Bomberman B-Daman Bakugaiden Victory.Bomberman Jetters  In Bomberman Jetters, White Bomber (or Shiro Bom) is the ten-year old brother of the hero, Mighty. However, unlike what people thought from the brave, gentle Mighty, his brother was actually childish, immature, and inexperienced, with only a single Bomb Star. Through the course of the series, he begins to mature and becomes more experienced.Comics  White Bomberman appeared in three of the German Club Nintendo comics. They were published only in Germany, though fan translations have appeared since then.Trivia Bomberman Games  A list of all Bomberman and other related video games.Bomberman 64  Bomberman 64, known as Baku Bomberman (\u7206\u30dc\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u30de\u30f3) in Japan, is the first Bomberman game to be released in full 3D, and the first made for the Nintendo 64. It is a complete reinvention of the traditional Bomberman formula, eschewing the grid of previous games in favor of open, free-roaming 3D environments and 8-way movement. While this new formula was carried over into a sequel (and the story modes of some other games), it never came to completely redefine the series, which eventually fully reverted to its classic gameplay style. Perhaps inspired by Super Mario 64, the game is also a collectathon adventure that requires gathering 100 hidden Gold Cards to access the true end of the game. More Gold Cards can be gathered to access other extras, up to a total of 120 (curiously, the number of Power Stars in Super Mario 64). Nearly twenty years later, Bomberman 64 was re-released for Wii U Virtual Console by Konami only a few days after the release of Super Bomberman R, likely to help promote that game.Story  Planet Bomber was a peaceful place until a strange fortress descends upon it. Attached to it are four pieces of planets that were conquered by the Masked Trio, and now they hope to conquer Planet Bomber. White Bomber discovers what's happening and as he's about to depart, a strange new ally named Sirius joins him. The duo set off to stop these new villains.Worlds Multiplayer  There is a battle mode and a team mode in multiplayer. Up to four people can play. You can use your custom Bombermen in this battle mode, by loading up your costumes from the Nintendo 64 Controller Pak memory card. The differences of custom characters are purely cosmetic with no effect on gameplay. Four additional multiplayer maps can be unlocked, either by collecting all 120 Gold Cards in the story mode (permanent unlock), or by rapidly pressing the Start button very quickly on the main menu (lasts until the game is turned off). In Japan, this Start button trick was intended to incentivize the purchase of a Hudson-made Joycard 64 controller with a turbo function, but it can be performed without it, or with a different third-party controller.Battle mode  The objective in this is to blow up the other players (or throw them off of the stage) and survive. Once you die you become a ghost and can take control of another player (that isn't already a ghost) for a brief time. Last one standing wins. Up to 4 people can play battle mode. It is very different to most Bomberman multiplayer battle modes in that the arena is quite free-roaming, rather than the usual grid based arenas, and players always have the ability to kick, throw and pump bombs. Also, certain maps have a pronounced third dimension, with stairways and multiple elevations from which bombs can be dropped down. The result of this heavily altered setup is that the game rewards pure aggression and long-distance fighting much more than in traditional Bomberman games, and the pace of battles is very fast. In the end, Hudson favored the original classic style Bomberman battles, and Bomberman 64: The Second Attack! would be the last time this gridless gameplay style was used in multiplayer.Team Mode  The objective of this is to destroy the other team's gem. If you die in this mode however, you simply come back to life, and not as a ghost like in Battle mode. The first team to destroy the other teams gem X number of times wins. Up to 4 people can play team mode.Notes Staff  The Bomberman 64 staffPretty Bomber  Pretty Bomber is a recurring character in the Bomberman series. She is the only female member of the Five Dastardly Bombers as well as the World Bombers. She was originally one of the first main antagonists of the series, but was later depicted as a friend and even love interest of Bomberman. In Super Bomberman R, she goes by her alter ego Karaoke Bomber (Sexy Bomber in Japanese), not to be confused with Karaoke-Bomber. She is also called Cute Pink in English releases of the Bomberman Land series, not to be confused with Pink Bomber.Biography  At some point in the past, she was involved in a plot on the planet Phantarion in which the Five Dastardly Bombers fought against the world's army and severely wounded Max before being forced back. In Super Bomberman 2, she and other Dastardly Bombers captured the original Bomberman, but he broke free on their ship. Pretty Bomber appeared as the third boss of the third world, utilizing Heart Bombs. In her boss machine, she did not openly attack Bomberman unless he broke the hearts that her machine created. She was defeated, and fell to Earth alongside the wreckage of her ship. In the PC Engine version of Bomberman: Panic Bomber, Pretty Bomber returned as one of the last opponents alongside Golem Bomber. She also reappeared in Super Bomberman - Panic Bomber W as a wandering combatant. Believing herself to be the sole survivor of the Dastardly Bombers, she interrupted Bomberman's fight with the World Bombers in order to challenge him and avenge her comrades. She returned in Super Bomberman 3, revived by Professor Bagura, her master. Pretty Bomber controlled Deep Sea in the Bomber Nebula and guarded the blue Mother Computer Chip. She later returned to battle in the combined mecha at the end of the game, but was bested again and left inside the exploding Battleship. She was also a playable World Bomber in Battle Mode (representing France). In Panic Bomber, Pretty Bomber is after the Gold Bomber statue, and attacks Bomberman after he has defeated Count Dracu-Boom in battle and gained access to the artifact. She is called \"Ms. Flashy\" in the North American version of the game. In Neo Bomberman, Pretty Bomber is kidnapped by Bagura for unknown reasons. After being rescued by White Bomberman and Black Bomberman, she flees. Pretty Bomber also appears as a rival racer against Bomberman, Black Bomberman, and Bagura in Bomberman Fantasy Race. In the first Bomberman Land, she appears as a minor antagonist that engages in mere mischievous acts. Bomberman tracks her down on more than one occasion to reclaim the goods she steals. In subsequent Bomberman Land titles, Pretty Bomber is on friendly terms with Bomberman and appears as one of the main protagonists of the series. In Bomberman Tournament, Pretty Bomber finally reunites with her old comrades and returns to Phantarion as the second boss, causing water pollution from Pretty Base. She tries to stop Bomberman for the last time, fusing with Pommy Sea to become PrettyBalloon, but is defeated and forced to flee. Before the events of Super Bomberman R, the five ended up as deactivated on Planet Scrapheap. Evil Emperor Buggler (Bagura) revived them to conquer the five planets of the Starry Sky Solar System in his name. The Bomberman Bros. (White and Black along with Blue, Red, Yellow, Green, Pink and Aqua) set out to stop the expansion of the Buggler Army's intergalactic conquest and liberate the invaded planets. Pretty Bomber, as Karaoke Bomber, is encountered on World 4: Planet Lalaland. She teases and flirts with Black when he refuses to fight a girl, but Pink interjects when Black starts turning red. Believing herself to be an interstellar star, Karaoke Bomber initiates her on-foot battle. After being blown clear, she utilizes her robot, Elegant Dream. Afterwards, Karaoke Bomber swears revenge and retreats, dropping a familiar heart-shaped pendant. Pink recognizes it as the same one she gave to their scrapped eldest sister, who had a fatal accident before all of them were built -- revealing that she is in fact Pretty Bomber, the missing ninth member of the Bomberman Bros. Later, Emperor Buggler is chased to an artificial Black Hole which threatens to engulf the solar system and eventually the whole universe. He summons the Five Dastardly Bombers to form Great Gattaida, which is defeated by the Bomberman Bros. As a last resort, Buggler uses his own power to grow into Ultimate Buggler. The Five Dastardly Bombers finally regained their senses after Great Gattaida was destroyed and voluntarily give their strength to the Bomberman Bros., defeating Buggler for now. Afterwards, the formerly Dastardly Bombers peacefully resumed their previous lives, again on good terms with the people of Planet Bomber.Personality  As a villain, Pretty Bomber is a calculated opponent who relies on her charm to confuse and trap foes. She appears as both a member of the Dastardly Bombers' schemes and as a rival to Bomberman in other ventures. In the Land sequels, Pretty Bomber is a fierce and confident competitor, but her sweet and generous side enabled her to befriend Bomberman. In Super Bomberman R, Pretty Bomber is a good singer and even has a song in the game's credits (sung by her Japanese voice actor) -- but her persona, Karaoke Bomber, has horrific singing, which is played to comedic effect during her Elegant Dream boss battle.Stats  In Super Bomberman 2, Pretty Bomber is fought face-to-face. She actively pursues Bomberman unless bombs are nearby, at which point she will focus on hiding from potential explosions until the danger is gone. Her stats are as follows:Powers Trivia Boss Forms References Bagura  Note: This character is referred to by a direct romanization due to it being rendered numerous times throughout the series. Bagura (officially Buglear, Bagulaa, Bugler, Buglar, Buggler, Bugglar, Burglar, or Bagular) is the head of the Robot Army, White Bomberman's nemesis and primary antagonist of many Bomberman games. He usually looks like a blue and white, large, elderly Bomberman with a bushy white beard, wearing a monocle and cape. Bagular appeared out of the vastness of space, with his history being unknown but his brilliance clear. Bagura is a brilliant (but mad) scientist and a dark magician, having controlled and created many evil creatures such as Bomber-Cyborgs, with the only purpose of conquering the universe. As one of Bomberman's more resilient enemies, he will stop at nothing to achieve his goals \u2014 it seems that he will always return.Biography  In Bomberman '94 Bagura, known as Buglear in the original version and Bagulaa in Mega Bomberman, was the main villain. He attacked Planet Bomber with his Robot Army, splitting the Spirit Pictures to throw it into chaos. Even though the planet shattered into smaller pieces, White Bomberman put it back together by repairing the Spirit Pictures. When his plans were ruined, Bagura sent his artificial comet on a collision course to the planet. Bomberman infiltrated it before it was too late and confronted Bagura. After defeating him and his dragon robot, he revealed his\u00a0Bomberman form, but was still no match for the original. In the end, his comet was destroyed. In Super Bomberman 3, Bagura, now known as Professor Bugler or Professor Buglar, appears as the master of the resurrected Five Dastardly Bombers, taking over five planets of the Bomber Nebula. White Bomberman and Black Bomberman were able to attack and defeat the Bombers, but upon losing control of the planets, Bagura targeted the planets for destruction with his Battleship. The heroes entered his ship and were able to take him and the Dastardly Bombers down, rendering them unconscious as the ship exploded. Bagura's body did not survive, but a light is shown emitting from his body. In the post-credits, his brain is revealed to have escaped in a mini saucer. In Super Bomberman 4, Bagura summoned the Four Bomber Kings and Great Bomber to attack White Bomberman, Black Bomberman, and their friends and exact revenge on them. Bagura's minions sent the heroes hurtling through time, but they once again fought back and confronted Bagura in the giant mech he formed himself into. The mech was destroyed and his mini saucer was lost in the time void somewhere. Although his original body was destroyed since his debut, Bagura still appears in an identical body in most appearances. How this is possible is unknown, but the most likely way of this being possible is that his body was never completely organic in the first place, which would explain his ability to create Rubber Bombs. Given that he is the \"creator\" of the Five Dastardly Bombers, it would make sense that he could have installed the same bomb-making ability into his own body. He is not seen in Bomberman GB 3, but Devil Bomber is said to be an experiment of his that he locked away. In Neo Bomberman, he is shown in his original body just fine without explanation to reclaim Pretty Bomber with his new creation, Atomic Bomber. In Bomberman World, he appears to reawaken the Dark Force Bombers, but is defeated on the Black Star. He is not seen escaping the explosion, but remarks that he will return. In Bomberman Wars, which is a prequel to the previous game, he appears under the name Dark Bomber in what appears to be a reconstructed body in what may be an older time period, perhaps explaining where he wound up after the events of Super Bomberman 4. Now known as Bagular, he makes another major appearance in Bomberman Hero, in which the Garaden Empire sets out to collect four data disks to form a different body. The army apparently had a difficult time creating a new body, or at least one suited for him, though this is largely because Princess Millian of Primus Star stole one of the disks from them and managed to send it to Planet Bomber before being captured, resulting in the disk coming into Bomberman's possession. The Garaden Empire finally reclaims the disk on Mazone Star thanks to the efforts of Natia, who disguises herself as Millian and tricks Bomberman into handing the disk to her. Despite Bomberman's best efforts, Natia manages to escape. Bagura is then revived on Garaden Star, regaining a corporeal body. This corporeal form is short-lived, however, as Bomberman defeats him, causing him to detonate the Garaden base as a final act of desperation in an attempt to kill Bomberman. Bagura's revival, Millian's kidnapping, and the creation of the Garaden Empire were plotted by Devil Bomber, who was just using Bagura to get his own revenge on Bomberman. Bagura makes an appearance in the spinoff Bomberman Fantasy Race, and makes a cameo in the opening animation of Bomberman Jetters. Bagura eventually reappears as the antagonist of Bomberman Portable, being the source of the shadowy threat looming over the nearby planets. He is fought multiple times throughout the game, using old inventions in new ways in an effort to eliminate Bomberman. Calling himself Emperor Buggler and with a more human appearance, he finally returns in Super Bomberman R. Evil Emperor Buggler revived the Five Dastardly Bombers (who had ended up as deactivated on Planet Scrapheap before the events of the game) to conquer the five planets of the Starry Sky Solar System in his name. The Bomberman Bros. (White and Black along with Blue, Red, Yellow, Green, Pink and Aqua) set out to stop the expansion of the Buggler Army's intergalactic conquest and liberate the invaded planets. Along the way, it is revealed on Planet Scrapheap that the reason the Five Dastardly Bombers were so dastardly was because they were forcibly under Buggler's control all along. Buggler is chased to World 6: Black Hole, an artificial anomaly which threatens to engulf the solar system and eventually the whole universe. He summons the Five Dastardly Bombers to form Great Gattaida, Pink Bomber then gets put in distress when she finds out that Buggler used her big sister, Pretty Bomber in the combined mecha, White Bomber, then yells that he will never forgive Buggler. The Great Gattaida then was defeated by the Bomberman Bros. As a last resort, Buggler uses his own power to grow into Ultimate Buggler. The Five Dastardly Bombers finally regained their senses after Great Gattaida was destroyed and voluntarily give their strength to the Bomberman Bros., defeating Buggler for now. With his final words, Buggler warns that he will always continue to return as long as evil exists in the hearts of men. Afterwards, the formerly Dastardly Bombers peacefully resumed their previous lives, again on good terms with the people of Planet Bomber.Personality  His personality has never really been made clear or expanded upon in the games, but he is shown to be incredibly evil. In Bomberman Jetters, his personality is initially perceived as incredibly evil and selfish, just like in the games. But it is revealed that he isn't evil at all, he merely has a strong, bitter rivalry with Dr. Ein because of a childhood crush on Momo, White Bomber's grandmother. Despite his so-called evil intentions, he never intends actual harm on anyone; this is shown when Max led a direct assault on Planet Jetters without his permission, and in fact strongly opposed it. Near the end of the anime, Bagura gains the role of the victim after MechaDoc seizes control of the Shumulvault and imprisons him. Bagura's relationship with Mujoe is then revealed to be more of a close friendship than that of a boss and his lackey, and Bagura begins to show genuine remorse when it seems that Mujoe has perished.Anime  In the anime series Bomberman Jetters, Bagura is the true leader of the Hige Hige Bandits with an adjusted personality and motive. However, he appears to be entirely unaffiliated with them in the game continuity, and the anime's depiction serves to combine the forces of two of Bomberman's persistent rivals.Powers  Although he appears to be an elderly man, Bagura has some rather powerful abilities at his disposal.Trivia Boss Forms Black Bomberman  Black Bomberman (also shortened Black Bomber) is a major character in the Bomberman series. A member of the Bombermen, who are usually inhabitants of Planet Bomber, he has the ability to generate bombs. He was the leader of his own gang of Bombermen, leading Red, Blue, Green and Yellow Bombers. He proclaims himself to be White Bomberman's best friend and most cunning rival. He is also nicknamed Kuro Bom in Japanese, which has been translated as \"Black Bomb\" in Bomberman Hero and localized as \"Cool Black\" in the English releases of the Bomberman Land series. Occasionally, this is further shortened to simply \"Kuro\" in the Japanese versions.Biography  Black Bomberman first appeared in Bomber Boy, both in the Vs. Mode as the second player and as evil copies in the main game. He had a more significant role in the TurboGrafx-16 Bomberman, in which he was the second robot by Dr. Mitsumori after White Bomberman. However, unlike his predecessor, a programming error made him veer from a righteous path. He kidnapped Dr. Mitsumori's daughter, Lisa, and escaped to the Mechanical Castle, but was defeated by White Bomberman. The two quickly became rivals. In Bomberman II, Black Bomberman framed White Bomberman for a bank robbery, and in Bomberman '93 he shut down a mother computer by stealing power circuits. In Super Bomberman, the evil Carat Diamond and his cohort, the scientist Dr. Mook, were holding a Robot Tournament with robots specially designed with combat and offensive capabilities. Hoping to steal Bomberman's advanced combat capabilities, Diamond created a fake Bomberman to go to Peace Town and kidnap the real Bomberman. Aware of Diamond's plot, Black Bomberman headed out alone to face the fake Bomberman, but was defeated. Black Bomberman somehow escaped and sought refuge with White Bomberman, warning him of Diamond's evil plan. This was the first time the two heroes had to join forces to overthrow a greater evil. Since them, he became a reluctant friend of White Bomberman, even receiving training from him. He then started acting as the second player in the two-player story modes of the rest of the Super games (excluding 2) and Saturn Bomberman. In Bomberman Hero, Black Bomberman assists White Bomberman in a few levels such as using his space pod to destory walls. Black Bomberman is also seen at the end after White Bomberman defeats Evil Bomber where he lets everyone know that everything is fine.Personality  He is usually portrayed with a gung-ho personality, rather serious in battle (although he likes to make fun of his opponents). He is a little more forceful, mildly frustrated at living in White's shadow, because he is unable to catch up with White Bomber's level of skill. He has a cool and collected personality in the later games, such as in Super Bomberman R where he's more of a narcissist (although he loses his cool around women). The instruction manual for Bomberman Land Wii states that he is surprisingly good at foreign languages.Boss Battles  Black Bomberman has appeared as a major boss in earlier games.Bomberman (TG-16)  Black will enter with his gang of Bombermen: Blue, Yellow, Red and Green. They will walk around the room randomly and after several seconds, all the Bombermen except Black will transform into flames and shoot fireballs at the player. During this form, they are invincible and will detonate any bombs that they touch. After a few seconds, they will transform back into Bombermen and become vulnerable again. Black has a shield and cannot be damaged until his minions are destroyed. After all four are defeated, Black will begin laying bombs and occasionally stopping to release green fire around himself. While he is walking around, his shield will occasionally wear off and make him vulnerable for a few seconds. He will sometimes teleport around the room as well.Bomberman '93  Black's gang will enter the room in race cars and drive about the room randomly. They lay landmine bombs which can make it difficult to dodge all of them and the bombs at the same time. After they are defeated, Black will appear in a large robot and the room will close in to a 9x11 grid. Black Bomberman will move around the room, firing the robot's fists and releasing fire from its open slots. After this form is defeated, the robot's body explodes and Black will be left inside of the head of the machine, hovering above the ground. He will move around the room and lay chains of bombs, occasionally lowering his vehicle within blasting range. This is the only time he can be damaged.Star Parodier  Black Bomber appears as the boss of Level 6 in this vertically scrolling shooter developed by Kaneko. He walks around a typical Bomberman grid arena and drops bombs in different patterns. The player must shoot Black Bomber while navigating the arena and dodging the explosions with a completely different type of movement. After the end of the stage, Black Bomber is shown crying over his loss, with White Bomber comforting him.B-Daman  In Bomberman B-Daman Bakugaiden and Bomberman B-Daman Bakugaiden Victory, Black Bomber\u00a0appears as one of the protagonists.Land  In the Bomberman Land series and related games, Black Bomber makes an appearance. His personality and design did not deviate much from the main series, with some games giving him a red scarf as in Bomberman Generation. While his name is unchanged in Japanese versions, English localizations refer to him as Cool Black.Trivia Bomberman 64: The Second Attack!  Bomberman 64: The Second Attack! (\u7206\u30dc\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\uff12, Baku Bonb\u0101man 2, lit. \"Explosive Bomberman 2) is a 1999 sequel to 1997's Bomberman 64. It expands over its predecessor in almost every possible way, adding a deeper storyline, better graphics, more involved levels and bosses, many types of elemental bombs, a playable companion character, and light RPG elements. Perhaps owing to its status as a late release for the Nintendo 64, it wasn't released in Europe. However, it would not be the final Bomberman game for the system.Story  Bomberman is flying through space when his ship detects a black hole. During his panic, Bomberman is knocked out and his ship is pulled into the black hole. He later awakens in a prison cell along with an egg that he had previously discovered on a hot springs planet. The egg hatches and Pommy appears, who slips through the bars and gets the fire stone back for Bomberman... Using his bombs, he destroys the door and the two escape, beginning their adventure to defeat the BHB Army and escape from the black hole.Gameplay  The player must navigate through 3D levels to find the exit. There are different conditions for clearing rooms such as defeating all the enemies or pressing certain switches. As in the game's predecessor, the player can \"pump\" their bombs and make them bigger and more powerful by holding them. There are Elemental Stones that can be used to enhance White Bomber's attack power in different ways, and destroy special obstacles. There is a shop that can be used to buy new items and costume parts. Despite the many expanded and new elements introduced to The Second Attack!, the collectathon focus has been greatly toned down from Bomberman 64. There is no equivalent of Gold Cards to be collected, and no special items other than the Elemental Stones are necessary to reach the true final boss and ending, making it far easier for casual players to experience the full adventure. However, pieces of a set of Guardian Armor can be obtained, which will permanently boost White Bomber's abilities in Story Mode. A big aspect of the game is raising Pommy. He acts as a helper character to assist White Bomber, and can be controlled by the computer or a second player. There is a long list of different forms he can attain through branching evolution paths over the course of the game by eating different quantities of the many types of food available to him, which are collected by White Bomber. In boss fights and some other rooms, Pommy will be too scared to assist the player, and will cower in a corner. A four-player Battle Mode similar to that of the original Bomberman 64 is also present. It is also greatly expanded, featuring a variety of alternate game modes (such as King and Knights), new battle maps (including one set in a miniature city with destructible buildings), and more options for creating customized Bombermen. It is the last Battle Mode in the Bomberman series to allow unrestricted movement in open arenas where players are not locked down to a grid.List of Food (for influencing Pommy's evolutions) Astral Knights  Baelfael, The Crimson Flame. Orange/Red, spiky hair. Fought on Alcatraz. His name is based on Belphegor. Behemos, Lord of the Frozen Wastes. Big, blue guy with an ice blaster. Fought on Aquanet. His name is based on Behemoth. Ashtarth, Lord of the Winds. Green, looks similar to Baelfael. Fought on Horizon. His name is based on Astaroth. Zhael, Mistress of the Storm. Purple/white, cat-looking. Fought on Starlight. Her name is based on Baal. Molok, The Raging Earth. Brown, rocky hulking dude. Fought on Neverland. His name is based on Moloch. Zoniha, The Purifying Light. Yellow armor, feminine. Fought on Epikyur. Her name is based on Amazonia. Bulzeeb, The Black Breath. Black, visor over his face. Fought on Thantos. Actually Regulus, a member of the Masked Trio from Bomberman 64. Bulzeeb's name is based on Beelzebub; incidentally, Regulus is also the name of a fallen angel in Stregheria. Rukifellth, The Dark Messenger and head of the seven knights. Blue hair, black hat. BHB Army Leader who wants to collect all the Elemental Stones. Found on the Warship Noah. His name is based on Lucifer.Endings Normal Ending  Upon defeating Sthertoth, Mihaele tries to stop the demon, but is too weak is assimilated along with Lilith's body. He grows powerful and with nothing to stop him, Sthertoth transforms into a giant, more sinister-looking and turns into the demon's true form - a huge, grotesque monster known as the God of Chaos. He plans to drape the universe in his darkness. After battle, Bomberman defeats the demon. Rukifellth and Lilith are once again their normal selves. However, the God of Chaos reappears, taking Rukifellth with him. He begins to destroy the Warship Noah. Bomberman, Pommy and Lilith attempt to escape, but Lilith decides to stay, as she can't leave Rukifellth behind. Bomberman and Pommy make it out in their ship. The Astral Knights remain fallen, and Rukifellth and Lilith are likely lost in the ensuing explosions. The credits roll as the ship flies in the starry background. This ending can occur in one of two ways - either the player doesn't obtain the last two stones (which also leads to the Lilith battle being skipped), or the player loses to Lilith from her Instant KO technique. She kills Bomberman and takes the stones he currently possesses, then leaves him. As Pommy mourns him, the power of the stones restore Bomberman to life and the story continues. Even if the player hasn't defeated Zoniha, Mihaele somehow has the Light Stone during the battle with Sthertoth.Good Ending  Bomberman defeats Sthertoth's incomplete form, and Mihaele traps him. She merges with him to become the creator of the universe, the Angel of Light and Shadow. The Angel deems the universe too corrupt, and wants to destroy it and create a new one. Bomberman resolves to stop it. Afterwards, the Angel decides that the universe is safe with a hero like Bomberman, and releases Lilith and Rukifellth from their trances. At the end, all of the Astral Knights return (as the Elemental Knights) - even Bulzeeb, who now insists that his name is Regulus and promises Bomberman that their fight is not quite over. Lilith and Rukifellth leave to travel the universe together, leaving Bomberman and Pommy to find a new adventure.Planets  There are seven different planets, plus a final level which, like most final levels in the Bomberman franchise (excluding secret/true final levels), is a spaceship. This game does not have any secret levels, but does have a optional bosses as well as one of two final bosses.Elemental Bombs  When Bomberman collects an Elemental Stone, he gains the power to use a different type of Bomb with that Stone's element. He can switch them out any time except for when a bomb is already out. Navarm Bombs and Gravity Bombs are not directly named after their corresponding stones, Earth and Shadow, respectively.Trivia Staff  The Staff of Bomberman 64: The Second Attack!Villains  VillainsBomberman Act:Zero  Bomberman Act:Zero is a video game for the Xbox 360. One of the biggest differences with this game is the appearance of a Bomberman. Instead of a simple cartoon-like design they have a more realistic/futuristic design.Story  This game is loosely based on the original Bomberman game. The main character is a nameless Bomberman (or woman) who is created for the sole purpose of fighting. They are awakened and thrown into a battle where only the strongest will survive.Gameplay  The player must use bombs to defeat their rival on each level. There are 99 levels and no save options or continues making the experience very difficult. The camera plays a unique role in this game in that it can be set to one of two options. It can be used either from the 2D perspective of previous Bomberman titles or a 3rd person mode where the camera follows behind the player. There is also an online multiplayer mode that can support up to 8 players worldwide; however, there is no local mode.Criticism  This game has received disappointing scores by many critics and a lot of harsh criticism from the fans. The gameplay has been called tedious and repetitive. The design of the protagonist (both genders) has been criticized for looking too \"sexual\" and too similar to character designs of comic artist Todd McFarlane. It has been noted that there is no save feature, resulting in the game restarting entirely after a game over. It has also been criticized for lacking any sort of local multiplayer mode, which is commonly seen as a necessity in a traditional Bomberman game.Scores Trivia External links Heroes  This is a list of Heroes in the Bomberman Universe.Astral Knights  The Astral Knights are the main bosses of Bomberman 64: The Second Attack!, and are led by Rukifellth.Background  The Astral Knights were once the Seven Elemental Knights, meant to watch over their respective stones and realms. Unfortunately, they became corrupt/brainwashed by Rukifellth some time before the events of The Second Attack! and joined his army to rule the galaxy. All with the exception of Bulzeeb were placed under his control; Bulzeeb joined Rukifellth to gain more power and simply faked the illusion of being controlled. Together with the BHB Army, they developed a device called the Gravity Generator to keep planets within the black hole and utilize the dark matter from them. The Knights somehow lost their Elemental Stones prior to joining Rukifellth, and had recovered all but the Fire Stone by the time Bomberman conveniently showed up at Alcatraz. Bomberman eventually defeated them one by one and proceeded to the BHB Army's headquarters, Warship Noah. Here, he defeats Rukifellth and escapes the black hole. In the Good Ending, after Bomberman defeats Angel of Light and Shadow in a final battle. The Angel brings them back to life as the Elemental Knights. They each give their gratitude to Bomberman before going off on their separate ways.Members Trivia  There are some slight differences regarding the Knights regional-wise:Bomberman Jetters (anime)  Bomberman Jetters is a 2002 anime focused on the adventures of young White Bomber (Shirobon in Japanese) with the intergalactic police force known as the Jetters, fighting against the Hige-Hige Bandits (Hige-Hige dan). It is also a coming-of-age story of White Bomber, as he is forced to deal with several challenging decisions and lessons that eventually mature himself. While comical in most episodes, the show does have several serious and emotional moments. It was animated by Studio Deen.Plot  When Mighty, the legendary Bomberman went missing on a mission six months ago, the Hige-Hige Bandits are now a step ahead, stealing all the unique items in the universe. White Bomber, younger brother of Mighty, then joined the Jetters in search of his brother. Now, White Bomber and the Jetters face the Hige-Hige Bandits and thwart their plans in their attempt to steal the items.Jetter Vehicles  Various vehicles are used to help the Jetters in their missions, usually dealing with the terrain of the planet to allow the Jetters to traverse the planet.Games  Three video games have been made that tie in to the anime:Trivia Pommy  Pommy is one of the most common of the Charaboms, appearing in several Bomberman games. Since his debut in Bomberman 64: The Second Attack, he has appeared in all games featuring Charaboms, most notably in the Bomberman Max games.History  Pommy first appeared in Bomberman 64: The Second Attack as the secondary protagonist. He could transform into multiple forms depending on what food you feed him (meat, fruits/veggies, and sweets). Food can be found by blowing up various destructible blocks. Later he appeared in other games, but given a smaller role, mostly as a holder of the Remote Control item.Bomberman 64: The Second Attack  After his egg was found on Hot Springs Planet Ksa2 sometime after Bomberman 64, White Bomber ended up being sucked into a black hole created by the BHB Army and captured. Shortly afterwards, Pommy's egg hatched and he introduced himself, but not before throwing a slight fit. He slips through the bars in the cell, and after a struggle with several soldiers, recovers the Fire Stone for Bomberman. The main reason for Pommy's inclusion is for a few small additions. He serves as a second player or computer, making it easier to knock out enemies. He can also evolve by collecting various food items hidden inside soft blocks. Depending on whether meats, fruits and veggies, or sweets are collected, Pommy will evolve into different forms. Pommy also points out things such as: Everything of importance that Pommy says is in yellow, to be pointed out to the player. It has been noted that Pommy loves the color pink. His original form (seen above in the picture) is the only one with a smug look as part of the avatars. The normal expression is used for every other form. He paints your starship pink upon landing on the next planet and his egg was pink as well.Other games Bomberman Generation  In Bomberman Generation, Pommy offers the Remote Control ability when equipped but is also used to make many fusions in the game such as Pommy Dragon.Bomberman Tournament  Pommy is referred to in Bomberman Tournament as a Karabon, instead of a Charabom. He is the first Karabon the player acquires. Pommy is incapable of evolving in this game, although some of Pommy's other forms from TSA are obtained as a separate entity throughout the course of the game. If he is set as the player's Karabon they can use his ability to teleport to cities they have already visited. He is fusable with another Karabon named Eliphan to create Pommy Fangs. Magnet Bomber fuses with Pommy Fangs to transform into Thunder Dragon. 60\n45\n65\n70\n Attribute: (Electric) \n\u00a0180 When Pommy is set, pressing the B button out in the field will allow the player to warp to most of the already-visited towns in the game. In Bomber bases, it will teleport the player to the first room. It cannot be used in caves (except Dark Cave), buildings, trapdoors or Bomberman's ship.Bomberman Jetters (video game)  In Bomberman Jetters, Pommy is found in Mechanical Garden. His ability is to help Bomberman jump from specified places. When he is leveled up, he can jump higher and farther.Notable forms Normal Pommy  Normal Pommy is the very 1st from of Pommy after he 1st hatches from his egg. Normal Pommy is the weakest Pommy of the them all. All it can do is headbutt; it is slow, only goes a very short distance, and if it does hit, it only knocks out the enemy. If Normal Pommy is fed lots of fruit, it will become Knuckle Pommy. If Normal Pommy is fed lots of meat, it will become Animal Pommy.Knuckle Pommy  Knuckle Pommy is a 2nd staged Pommy after Normal Pommy eats 16 pieces of fruit. Knuckle Pommy's attack is a punch which only goes a small distance and knocks the enemies out. Knuckle Pommy can become either Hammer Pommy if you give him lots of fruit or Claw Pommy if you give him lots of Meat.Animal Pommy  Animal Pommy is a 2nd-staged Pommy after Normal Pommy eats 16 pieces of meat. Animal Pommy's attack is a headbutt that knocks enemies out. It has a longer range and faster execution speed than Normal Pommy's headbutt. Animal Pommy becomes Penguin Pommy if fed lots of fruit or Beast Pommy if fed lots of meat.Pommy Sea  Pommy Sea only appears in Bomberman Tournament. The player needs to fuse Kai-man and Knuckle Pommy with SID to create him. Pommy Sea enables the player to open the last door in PrettyBase. Pretty Bomber fuses with Pommy Sea to turn into Pretty Balloon. After Pretty Balloon is defeated, Pommy Sea returns to Bomberman.Max Stats From Bomberman Max 2  Type: Electric Level: 60 Attack: 215 Defense: 210 Special: 235 Agility: 90 Abiltiy: Max Speed Location: Blue Version, Area 1-1Trivia External links Altair  Altair is one of the main villains of Bomberman 64, being both an emperor and the leader of the Masked Trio. He is dressed in purple and black armor.Biography  Some time before Bomberman 64, Altair and his subordinates teamed up to steal the Omni Cube, an object which holds great power, from Sirius. Even with the four working together, they were barely able to steal the cube from him. Altair started using the cube's powers to make himself more powerful, as well as learning the secrets of civilizations trapped inside the cube and to make himself a kind of god for the trapped essence in the cube. Altair started to completely control the lives within the cube, but he wanted even more power. He wanted to rule the entire universe with the power of the Omni Cube, so he and his subordinates began invading and draining the energy of several planets around the galaxy, as well as keeping a chunk of them with his ship, the Black Fortress, to protect it. One of the planets attacked was Planet Bomber, where he anchors his fortress.  Thanks to Altair's incompetence on how to use the Omni Cube and the help of Sirius, White Bomberman had time to defeat all of his henchmen and invaded his fortress. Altair fought Bomberman with the help of his servant robot Vega and even fused with it to became \"Super Altair,\" a robotic form, when it was clear they were about to lose. However, this wasn't enough to stop Bomberman, who defeated the newly formed Super Altair. Regulus, seeing his master dying, came to save him, but was knocked out by Sirius, who absorbed the Omni Cube and destroyed Super Altair with a large beam.Personality  Altair is an insane and mysterious bomber who treats the inhabitants of planets like specks of dust. However, he is held in high regard by his subordinates (as Regulus returns to save him).Powers Gold Cards Etymology  Altair is named after one of the brightest stars visible to Earth.Trivia Regulus  Regulus, also known as Bulzeeb, is a rival character in the N64 series of Bomberman games.Story  Regulus is one of the Masked Trio in\u00a0Bomberman 64, a group of evil Bombermen serving under Altair. He is Altair's right-hand man and an excellent fighter. He helped steal the Omni Cube from Sirius, but acknowledges that he was unable to defeat Sirius even with the help of his friends. Bomberman faces him in White Glacier, where he is beaten but not killed. He promises Bomberman that the battle isn't over yet. Later, in Altair's Black Fortress, Regulus descends to help a battered Altair off of the battlefield. Unfortunately, Sirius knocks Regulus down the surrounding pit, takes back the Omni Cube and disintegrates Altair. When Bomberman faces Sirius, Regulus saves him from destruction and breaks the Omni Cube with his special attack. He then helps Bomberman take down the enraged Sirius once and for all. After carrying Bomberman out of the exploding ship, Regulus commends the hero for being able to take down Sirius so easily and reveals his backstory, but promises that he will return to do battle again. An outtake of Bomberman's fight with Regulus is shown in the true credits of the game; When doing his pose on top of the icicle, he loses his footing and falls off. In Bomberman 64: The Second Attack!, Regulus turns his armor black and renames himself Bulzeeb, because he believed his old name was tainted by his previous loss against Bomberman. He is revealed to be one of the Astral Knights as well, the strongest and wisest one. He is often able to halt disputes within his team and is the only one who does not underestimate Bomberman's true strength. When facing Bomberman on Prison Planet Thantos, he uses many new dark abilities, but is still defeated. Before he can retreat, Lilith appears to confront him and reveals that Regulus is the only knight who withstood Sthertoth's mind control, so Regulus explains that he used the plot to gain more power. He is eventually convinced to hand over the Shadow Stone, but tells Bomberman that they will fight again on the Warship Noah. Sthertoth, however, discover's Regulus' plan and kills him right in front of Bomberman. Regulus is later brought back to life after the Angel of Light and Shadow is bested in battle, promising again to continue his fight with Bomberman. When addressed as \"Bulzeeb\", he says that his name is Regulus.Personality  Regulus states clearly that he lives for basically two things: to gain more power, and to defeat Bomberman. The latter may be because he was defeated by Bomberman before, or it may be because Bomberman caused the death of his former team in Bomberman 64. As such, he shows little concern for other people, and usually provides some sort of excuse if he needs to help them. Underneath, it is hinted that he may have a heart, but he chooses not to believe in it.Powers Other Notes Quotes Bomberman 64 The Second Attack!

Bulzeeb's English name is a simplified rearrangement.Trivia Sirius  Sirius is a character in the Bomberman series. He only appears in Bomberman 64. His purpose at the beginning of the game is to serve as a guide for learning the game's controls and mechanics, and he continues to assist White Bomber throughout the main part of the game, but he eventually shows his true intentions as a manipulative villain.Background  Some time before Bomberman 64, Altair, Orion, Artemis, and Regulus teamed up to steal the Omni Cube, which holds great power, from Sirius, the emperor of Rainbow Palace. Even with the four working together, they were barely able to steal the cube from him. To power the Onmi Cube, the four began draining the energy of planets around the galaxy, and one of them was Planet Bomber. As Sirius wanted the Omni Cube back, he searched for the hero of that planet that could defeat Altair for him, because, without the cube, Sirius was unable to even scratch him. Sirius finds White Bomberman and decides to use and cooperate with him. Sirius tells that he wants to defeat Altair in return for revenge, because he killed his family and destroyed his planet. However, these were just \"corny lies\" told by Sirius to induce Bomberman to help him recover the Omni Cube from Altair. After Bomberman found all the Gold Cards and defeated Altair, Sirius showed up, absorbed the power of the Omni Cube, knocked Regulus in a pit, and vaporized Altair and Vega with an extra-large laser. As Sirius didn't need Bomberman anymore, he headed to Rainbow Palace to destroy Planet Bomber. Regulus destroyed the Omni Cube and teamed up with Bomberman to fight Sirius. In the end, Sirius was completely destroyed. Alternatively, if Bomberman does not collect all of the Gold Cards prior to defeating Altair, Regulus will carry Altair away to safety. This causes Sirius to express his disappointment with Bomberman, and he then appears to leave Planet Bomber, saying that he and Bomberman will probably never meet again. The bad ending concludes showing that Altair's attempted destruction of Planet Bomber resumed. However, a teaser showing Bomberman in the Rainbow Palace appears during the credits after this ending, suggesting to the player that there is more to be done.Personality  Sirius is a mysterious man, initially seeming like a good person. Gradually, his conversations with Bomberman start sounding more sinister and suspicious. After defeating Altair with all available Gold Cards collected, Sirius reveals his true personality as a cruel and manipulative liar who uses anyone to get what he wants, seeing as he manipulated Bomberman for the entire course of the game and intended to destroy both him and Planet Bomber once he was no longer of any use to him.Powers Gold Cards (Green Garden) Gold Cards (Rainbow Palace) Quotes  Voice: Text:Etymology  Sirius comes from a romanization of Greek \u03a3\u03b5\u03af\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, Seirios meaning \"glowing\" and is one of Earth's brightest stars in the night sky.Trivia Nintendo 64  Nintendo 64 is a home console developed by Nintendo.

A UFO appears and retrieves their remains. The alien, known as Professor Bagura, creator of the Dastardly Bombers, revives the villains and sends them to five planets of the Bomber Nebula. Each bomber steals and dismantles the Mother Computer Chip on each planet and scatters the pieces across the land, powering down the network. It is up to White Bomberman and Black Bomberman to save the planets and stop Bagura's plans of space conquest.Characters Worlds Battle game  Up to five players can compete in a Single or Tag Match. In the Single Match, the last player standing wins, while in the Tag Match, players are split into two teams.Special options Characters  Continuing the trend set by Bomberman '94, Super Bomberman 3's Battle Game features various playable characters in the form of the World Bombers (including one of the game's villains, Pretty Bomber, albeit with different sprites).Stages Items Secrets  There are several secrets in the game, most of which can be accessed with passwords.Trivia Staff  The Super Bomberman 3 staffBomberman Hero  Bomberman Hero, known as Bomberman Hero: Princess Millian Rescue! (\u30dc\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\u30d2\u30fc\u30ed\u30fc \u30df\u30ea\u30a2\u30f3\u738b\u5973\u3092\u6551\u3048!) in Japan, was released for the Nintendo 64 in 1998 and for the Wii Virtual Console in 2011. Hero focuses on single player action and is one of the few Bomberman games to not include any sort of multiplayer mode. To date, it remains the only Bomberman game in the 3D platformer genre. Though many have compared the game to Super Mario 64, it follows a quite different gameplay style and structure, with linear stages and fixed camera angles. Also, while collectathon elements are present, the focus is instead on attaining a perfect score or time on each stage, on which the player is graded.Story  As taken from the English manual: \"Bomberman was training very hard day and night at Bomber Base to keep the universe peaceful. One day, he received an order to check out a spaceship that had crashed in the Peace Mountains. When our hero arrived at the scene, he found a strange looking robot. According to this robot, the planet Primus Star was attacked by the Garaden Empire. This robot was able to escape with Princess Millian of Primus Star via spaceship, but the Garaden Empire captured them and took the princess away... To help out, Bomberman left his home and embarked on a journey to save Princess Millian!\"Gameplay  The player must navigate White Bomber through 3D environments to find the exit. By default, he can jump, climb on ledges, throw bombs, and lay and kick bombs. Some stages feature White Bomber wearing different Power Gear, which have totally different control schemes. Louie also assists White Bomber as a rideable mount in certain stages, with his own unique playstyle. Unlike in most Bomberman games, laying and kicking bombs are of limited usefulness, except in situations where they are required (such as to activate a switch through a small hole). For most of the game, players will rely on hurling bombs at enemies and objects, which detonate immediately upon impact. When the player clears a stage they are given a rank from 1-5 based on how high their score was. You can build your score by defeating enemies, collecting gems or power ups, or destroying objects. For boss stages, the score is dependent on how fast the boss is beaten. To earn a 5 you must earn every possible point in the stage. There are five planets and one secret one. Most of the planets have three areas with about 5 to 7 stages each. To access the secret planet Gossick Star and fight the true final boss, all the hidden Adok Bomb items must be collected, and the player must attain a perfect score in each prior stage. Additionally, there are two bonus game modes that can be played from the options menu, Slider Race and Millian's Treasure Hunt. These are unlocked after collecting 3 and 6 gold medals, respectively. Gold medals are awarded after attaining a rank of 5 for every stage in a single world. Slider Race is a short minigame challenge with the Bomber Slider down a slope covered with ice walls. Millian's Treasure Hunt is a return trip through the entire main game, except with a different storyline, where the Adok Bombs have been replaced by pieces of treasure belonging to Princess Millian.Levels  Golden Bomber has his own set of levels which are unlocked after clearing Gossick Star. These do not appear on the level selection menu, and two of the three are repeats of previous underwater levels, except with the ability to walk on the ground. Bomber Star can be unlocked at any point in the game by pressing the Start button rapidly during the intro cinematic, then selecting the Bonus option.Music  Bomberman Hero is well regarded for its highly distinctive soundtrack by series veteran Jun \"Chiki\" Chikuma, which incorporates elements of hip-hop, breakbeat and Detroit techno, along with prominent use of ambient sounds. The music has a very different identity from any other Bomberman soundtrack to date, generally sounding much more \"serious\" and less cartoonish than usual. The odd track titles like \"Oropharynx\" and \"Monogenic\" reflect this change in style. The game's original soundtrack CD case art contains a very striking photograph of a real-life CD destroyed by an explosion, creating the illusion that the case has been damaged by a bomb. Strangely, there are no images related to the Bomberman series anywhere on the case, booklet or CD. The soundtrack CD also includes a bonus track that never appears in-game, \"Loom.\" Unlike the in-game audio, this track uses real instruments, and sounds completely unlike any other music from the Bomberman series, including that of Hero. It seems this track was not intended to have anything to do with Bomberman Hero, and was included to showcase the composer's other work.Trivia Gallery Max  Max Bomber (shortened to Max) is Bomberman's ally and a recurring character of the Bomberman series. Max is a somewhat competitive cyborg who could be related to a royal family of some sort. Coming from the planet Phantarion, Max has a strong sense of justice, but likes to do things his own way. He wears a black suit/droid-like armor with a helmet that completely hides his face. He is a good friend and rival of Bomberman.Biography  Some time before his first appearance, Brain Bomber led an attack on Phantarion, but he and the rest of the Dastardly Bombers were driven away by the army of the planet and Max, a blue-eyed samurai that became known as \u201cthe legendary hero\u201d after the battle. Max and Brain Bomber battled, but Max was badly wounded to the point of cybernetic repair, being transformed into a cyborg with many hidden and modified abilities. Max entered an intergalactic police force at Bomber Base (the same one that White Bomber is part of) and then first appeared in Bomberman Max (both Blue Champion and Red Challenge, being the playable character in the latter). The story in both versions of the game is the same, where an artificial intelligence named Brain, a supercomputer that controlled all the defenses of 5 stars, was infected with a virus. The computer went nuts and transformed the five peaceful, happy planets into cold, dark, mechanical worlds. Dr. Ein tracked the computer\u2019s malfunction, and sent Bomberman and Max to shutdown the evil computers to save the unique Charaboms living on the planets. Despite the urgency of the mission, Max challenged White Bomberman to a race to see who can save the Charaboms and defeat Brain first. After the defeat of Brain, Max reappeared in Bomberman Tournament. The Dastardly Bombers returned to Phantarion and played their plan out as they had the first time, only that this time the Dastardly Bombers were prepared and sealed away the Phantarion army. The people of Phantarion sent out a distress call, and Professor Ein sent Max to investigate. Upon arriving on the planet, Max made his way to Plasma Bomber's fortress, but was rendered unconscious by Plasma Bomber and brainwashed by Brain Bomber to do his bidding, taking over the planet and making Max work on a massive mecha known only as the Ultimate Weapon. A week later since their last contact with Max, Dr. Ein sent Bomberman to save Phantarion and find Max. Each time Bomberman defeated one of the Dastardly Bombers, a hologram of Max showed up and gave a medal and a heart to Bomberman, as well as some information. In the end, White Bomberman showed up at a warped and corrupted version of Fantasy and fought Max, helping him recover from his puppet state. Together, Max and White defeated a powered-up Brain Bomber and destroyed the Ultimate Weapon. Brain Bomber and the rest of the team retreated. Since them, Max has become a recurring character and is often sent with White Bomber to missions to help restore peace in the galaxy, although sometimes he prefers to work alone, because he likes to deal with the antagonists his own way. Max's most recent appearance is in Bomberman 2 for Nintendo DS, where he is unlockable by earning S ranks in time and score on every stage. In this game, he does not use thunder bombs, but he always has all specs maxed out. He is also immune to poison and can see which soft blocks contain items. He also uses 0 PP, making him very strong in multiplayer if the PP limit is set to 20. On June 7th 2018, Max was revealed to be a playable character exclusive to the Nintendo Switch version of Super Bomberman R.Personality  Max is a somewhat competitive and arrogant individual with a strong sense of justice, liking to do things his own way.Powers Anime  In the Bomberman Jetters anime, in a stark contrast to the games, Max (also known as MA-10) is a purely evil villain who is an android, rather than a cyborg, and is member of the Hige Hige Bandits. At first solely referred to as the infamous \"Space Bounty Hunter\", he is employed by Bagura on MechaDoc's recommendation to steal unique items in the universe.Trivia Bosses  BossesFive Dastardly Bombers  The Five Dastardly Bombers are a recurring group of bosses resembling Bombermen. In early English translations, they were also called the Five Bad Bombers.Story  In Super Bomberman 2, the Five Dastardly Bombers appear for the first time to antagonize White Bomberman. They claimed that they were sent by aliens who wanted to take over the universe, and came to Earth so they could \"capture the original Bomberman.\" They were strong enough to defeat Bomberman and put him a prison cell in Magnet Bomber's base, but were defeated one-by-one when he broke loose on their ship. In their defeat, they fell to Earth alongside the wreckage of their ship. They returned in Super Bomberman 3, revived by Professor Bagura, the one who modified them in the first place. Each Dastardly Bomber took control of a planet in the Bomber Nebula, stealing and scattering the shards of the Mother Computer Chips. Again they were bested, this time by the combined efforts of White Bomberman and Black Bomberman. Aboard Bagura's Battleship, they combined into the fighting mecha Gattaida, but were ultimately defeated and left inside the exploding saucer. In the spin-off Super Famicom game Bomberman B-Daman, the four male characters appear as living targets on some of the game boards, while Pretty Bomber appears on the edge of the screen in the background of one of the worlds.  At some point in the past, they were involved in a plot on Phantarion, led by Brain Bomber, in which they fought against the world's army and severely wounded Max. They returned many years later in Bomberman Tournament to follow through with the same old plot, but with revised plans based on their previous mistakes - they stole the four medals of Fantasy and sealed the Phantarion army inside Fairy Palace. The plan worked, and they ruled over the planet for about one year until Bomberman came to stop them. They were last seen retreating. Before the events of Super Bomberman R, the five ended up as deactivated on Planet Scrapheap. Evil Emperor Buggler (Bagura) revived them to conquer the five planets of the Starry Sky Solar System in his name. The Bomberman Bros. (White and Black along with Blue, Red, Yellow, Green, Pink and Aqua) set out to stop the expansion of the Buggler Army's intergalactic conquest and liberate the invaded planets. Along the way, it is discovered on Planet Lalaland that Pretty Bomber (masquerading as Karaoke Bomber) is in fact the scrapped eldest sister of the family who had suffered an accident before all eight original Bombermen were built. Plasma Bomber is eventually confronted on Planet Scrapheap, and states that he views organic life-forms as inferior and ungrateful to robotic life-forms, gravely saying that White will one day be tossed aside as discarded junk like him. After he is fought, he attempts to take out White during the confusion but his memory returns in the nick of time, making him realize that he was built and beloved as a protector of mankind. Enraged, Emperor Buggler appears and paralyses Plasma Bomber. It is revealed that the reason the Five Dastardly Bombers were so dastardly was because they were forcibly under Buggler's control all along. Buggler is chased to an artificial Black Hole which threatens to engulf the solar system and eventually the whole universe. He summons the Five Dastardly Bombers to form Great Gattaida, which is defeated by the Bomberman Bros. As a last resort, Buggler uses his own power to grow into Ultimate Buggler. The Five Dastardly Bombers finally regained their senses after Great Gattaida was destroyed and voluntarily give their strength to the Bomberman Bros., defeating Buggler for now. Afterwards, the formerly Dastardly Bombers peacefully resumed their previous lives, again on good terms with the people of Planet Bomber.Traits  The Five Dastardly Bombers are cyborgs, given the ability to plant bombs like Bomberman. They have several similar characteristics:Members Trivia References Super Bomberman 4  Super Bomberman 4 (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30dc\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u30de\u30f34, S\u016bp\u0101bonb\u0101man 4, in Japan) is the fourth game in the Super Bomberman series.

It is a successor to the Bomberman 64 series, retaining the free-roaming, gridless 3D Story Mode maps of those games, along with the elemental bombs and RPG elements of The Second Attack! However, the game's Battle Mode reverted to a traditional grid format with 4-way grid movementStory  Deep within the universe, six magical items called the bomb elements were salvaged by a freighter sent out by Dr. Ein. While on their return to Planet Bomber, they are intercepted by a hired gun sent by the Hige Hige Bandits led by Mujoe. The elements are scattered on the planet Tentacalls and to make matters worse, the Hige Hige Bandits recruited the evil Crush Bombers. Ein contacts Bomber Base to send White Bomber and Max (who will do things his own way) to retrieve them before their enemies do...Crush Bombers Megaton Bomber  Megaton Bomber is a huge bomber who is the strength of the Crush Bombers, his signature weapon is a Spiked Morning Star. His personality is best described as the big, strong, slow doofus character. The ball is held by a claw at the end of his arm and the chain is fed through the palm of his hand. His signature move is the \"Megaton Crush,\" where he pounds the ground, sending shock waves through the arena, stunning Bomberman and making him let go of any a bomb he may be holding at the time.Beauty Bomber  Another Pretty Bomber who gloats about her looks, as her personality makes her out to be a materialistic princess. Beauty Bomber's main method of attack is hitting bombs with her hips, causing them to bounce along the ground at Bomberman. If weakened enough, she will use her stage light lasers to either track in on Bomberman's position and shoot lasers at him, or use the lights as a protective barrier that absorbs damaging bomb blasts.Eagle Bomber  Eagle Bomber is the speed of the Crush Bombers. His own personality shows him as arrogant and brash. With jet packs and a pair of sharp wings on his back, he uses his own body as a preferred weapon. His main attack usually consists of flying in a spinning motion and in a lazy, haphazard manner in which to catch Bomberman off-guard. His main explosive attack consists of him flying up and carpet-bombing the entire arena, the positioning of said explosives being hard to maneuver through. He will also spin like a top and, if he catches Bomberman, will pick him up, fly into the air, and pile-drive him onto the ground.Assault Bomber  Assault Bomber is huge bomber who is loaded with a plethora of weapons. His personality shows him as psychotic and malevolent. Assault Bomber is more of a mech than a \"Bomber\" as he attacks mainly using his machine gun mounted on his arm, though his has an attack that consists of him chasing Bomberman around the room dropping a payload of red explosive spheres (thereby, his \"bombing\" attack). He can also separate his upper body from his lower body and hover around.Bomber Elite  The cape-wearing leader of the Crush Bombers\u2014and as expected, is the strongest. He has psycho-kinetic powers and can teleport. He also has more honor than the rest of the Crush Bombers, and seems to be the most playful, telling Bomberman he'll 'play' with him because he's bored. For the first part of the battle, he is toying with Bomberman, rather than taking him seriously. But once Bomberman proves himself worthy by getting Bomber Elite down to one heart, he \"gets serious\" and blasts spheres of energy that grow as they rotate in the area. After being defeated, he extends his hand towards Bomberman, praising him for defeating him. The reason for this is unclear. But it saddens Bomberman, and even makes him cry. Unlike the other Crush Bombers, however, Bomber Elite does not explode after dying. He simply falls to the ground, and transforms into liquid-like sparkles that evaporate into the air. He is sometimes mistaken to be a she, due to a feminine voice; however, in cut-scenes, Dr. Ein clearly describes Bomber Elite as a male.Gameplay  The player must use navigate through 3D environments which feature a lot of puzzle-like elements compared to previous games. They can use bombs and collect Charaboms through minigames to unlock new abilities. Most stages have a miniboss at the end and each area has two boss fights: one against a Crush Bomber and one against a monster. The multiplayer mode features five available modes and can support up to four players at once. The modes are:Charaboms Levels Trivia ", "Blue Dragon Wiki": "Blue Dragon Wiki Main Page Characters  This is a list of notable characters who have appeared in Blue Dragon (Xbox 360) and Blue Dragon (anime) Each character page has detailed info on both their game and anime counterparts.Main Characters Gran Kingdom Rosekstan White Guardians Other Shu  Shu (\u30b7\u30e5\u30a6 Shuu) is the main protagonist of the Blue Dragon universe. He is a ten-year-old boy who lives in the village of Talta.Appearance  In the game, Shu has a round face, a normal complexion, black round eyes and dark-brown long jagged hair. His hair is dressed in a ponytail with a red hair-tie, he wears a black top, a yellow pants a red ribbon around it, blue protective sleeves, blue legwarmers and brown boots. In the anime, Shu has a round face, a bronzy complexion, black round eyes and dark-brown long jagged hair. His hair is dressed in a ponytail with a red hair-tie, he wears a black top, a yellow pants a red ribbon around it, blue protective sleeves, blue legwarmers and brown boots.Personality  Shu first appears as a brash, stubborn and impetuous character which often gets him into trouble. But his courage, strength and bright determination have saved him from certain death many times. Despite his bad habit, Shu is actually honest, sincere and protective to his friends which he prioritizes first whenever the situation becomes worse. This was shown when he chose to awake an unconscious Jiro and Kluke after the Land Shark escaped their trap and chose to wake them up before opening treasure chests and Nene tried to crush him and his friends with his mech. In Blue Dragon Plus, he warps a trapped Marumaro and Zola to safe location forfeiting any opening to defeat Nene. Regardless of whatever circumstances corners him into, Shu refuses to give in thus extending him of his catchphrase: \"I won't give up!\". He refuses to retreat unless the situation forces him to prioritize the people he cares about first. Shu is close friends with Jiro and Kluke. While Jiro is his complete opposite and they occasionally get into arguments they make up rather easily and work great together in Jiro's strategies and in battle. Shu thinks of Kluke as a special person as she is always brave no matter how hard things have gotten. He is also the closest to Marumaro acting as though they're brothers. Shu never wants to do anything that will hurt his friends even if they are enemies neither if they are defenseless. In romance Shu is rather oblivious to this emotion, which gets him yelled at by Kluke and Sahlia. Shu admits he was never good with girls. Despite this, he has a crush on Kluke and said he had mixed feelings when she chose both his and Jiro's good luck rings they made. He even flat out asked who she liked to which she said to wait until her next birthday. He also has a possible crush on Sahlia. When they first met she was rather cold toward Shu telling him to leave her alone. When Sahlia attempted to fall off a cliff, Shu saved her but got yelled at by her telling her past and now wanting to be dead without her family and giving up on the phrase \"don't give up\". Shu reconciles by telling her him and his friends' past experiences of losing their families to Nene. This gives Shu the strength to regain his shadow, Blue Dragon after he lost this ability to Nene and partially regained it to save his friends and destroy the Eat Yeet that was terrorizing Sahlia's village. Before Shu make their leave Sahlia gives them cookies she made. Marumaro asked if she liked to which Shu knocked him on the head and Sahlia responded by saying she respects him. As she leaves Shu is teased if he likes her which he angrily replies to \"knock it off!\". In Blue Dragon Plus Sahlia joined the party inspired by Shu to not give up and Shu blushed saying \"whatever\". During a point in the game is asked if he likes Kluke or Sahlia more to which Sahlia admits she wants to know. In the anime, Shu is more impulsive than in the game he is also somewhat a pervert when around Bouquet but keeps it to a lesser degree than Marumaro. He has admiration and a dream to become a Knight Master. Shu knows when to give things up shown when he forfeited\u00a0money he received for informant business to orphans.Relationships Jiro  In the first game, Shu and Jiro are best friends; it even mentions in the Blue Dragon handbook that they were classmates, however, this is not shown in the game. Their friendship is expressed at multiple times in the game: the two built a trap for the Land Shark together - Kluke was not involved and they are seen giving each other a high five after defeating the Steel-Eating Tigers attacking the villagers. However, when Kluke was taken away by the Jumbo Mecha Robo, the two were soon engaged in a fight and refused to talk to one another until night. It was there that the player learns\u00a0that Jiro really likes Kluke and that Shu thinks she's 'special'. At the end of the game, the two compete (not shown on screen) to get Kluke a birthday present. In Blue Dragon Plus, Jiro seems a bit more hostile towards Shu - at one point, depending on the characters chosen in the party, calling him a 'dunce'. Their friendship isn't there as much as it was in the first game. In Blue Dragon Awakened Shadow, they compete against each other to see who can gather more medicinal herbs for Kluke. According to one of the villagers on the Neo Jibral Cube, she admits that Jiro and Shu are best friends, but also rivals. In contrast to the anime, Jiro and Shu are seen fighting with each other almost every episode. When Zola invited Shu to travel with her and Jiro, he argues with Zola that Shu will be only a nuisance, and thinks that Shu is weak and stupid. But, they start to develop a friendship around Episode 31, when Jiro saw the strength and determination of Shu and realizes that he acted like an idiot until then, always wanting to be stronger and fighting alone. At the end of the season both promise they will get stronger and they'll see again. In Tenkai no Shichi Ryuu, Jiro first challenges Shu to a fight on a first meeting, knowing the latter had a Shadow. Jiro wins and, after a few events, he refuses to go along with Shu; bent on defeating Delphinium. He doesn't interact much with Shu, but he does appear occasionally with Xi (Sui) to help out with their (Shu, Bouquet, Marumaro, and Noi) adventure.Kluke  In the game, he, Kluke, and Jiro are close friends. Later on the game, he realizes his feelings for Kluke and often competes with Jiro over her feelings, like in \"Jiro in love\" where he challenges Jiro on gathering the most herbs for Kluke and the winner gets a date with her. In the anime, he and Kluke always argue with one another; but whenever Kluke is in trouble he always comes to save her, no matter what. As in the game, he harbors romantic feelings for her. In Trials of the Seven Shadows, he and Kluke are more than just childhood friends because the both of them share the same romantic feelings that they share and they will love each other.Marumaro  In the game, they are brotherly like. This is mostly expressed when King Jibral says, \"You two sound just like brothers.\" In the anime, not much is known about their relationship. In Trials of the Seven Shadows, Marumaro ends up traveling with Shu.Zola  In the game, he seems to harbor great respect for her. At the end of the game, he is visibly upset and feels betrayed when the truth about her working for Nene comes out. In the anime series, he persistently shows faith in her, even in spite of the fact that she manipulated him and their friends.History  In the game, Shu's background remains unknown except being born in Talta Village and his parents killed in an epidemic when he was young. Afterwards, Shu was raised by his Grandfather Fushira while being friends with Jiro and Kluke for a long time.Shadow  As a Shadow Wielder, Shu's shadow is the Blue Dragon after swallowing a Light Sphere which is actually a fragment of Nene's soul. In the game, Blue Dragon initially uses Magic Sword attacks but later gains other abilities such as White Magic to heal party members. When Nene takes back his soul from the group (except Zola), Shu temporarily loses Blue Dragon but later regains due to his obstinate spirit. After a fight and what remaining power Nene has, Blue Dragon gains the Corporeal attack to give it an actual body and temporarily changing the environment into a volcanic region. After Shu jumps on Blue Dragon, going up into the sky, and doing three strikes, Blue Dragon imitates by performing two fire infused slashes to the enemy that creates trenches and fires a fireball to create a great explosion. In Blue Dragon Plus and Awakened Shadow, Shu and his friends makes use of other Shadows sealed within prisms for different attacks rather than having their shadow have another class assigned to them. His Corporeal attack is also slightly different in both games. In the first episode of the anime during the Gran Kingdom invasion of Talta Village, Shu wanted to save everyone then suddenly a mysterious power came from Shu that he had no idea that he had. When Blue Dragon first appears he gets out of control. At first Blue Dragon doesn't cooperate with Shu until their fight with Ivanov and Gustav when Shu managed to gain enough power to control him. For most of the anime, he is quite insulting towards him and constantly criticizes everything Shu does. The Blue Dragon is in fact depicted as having very violent personality\u00a0and is extremely cold, not caring about anything or anyone but himself, but as time goes on, he begins to become concerned when Shu is hurt.Part in Story Blue Dragon (Xbox 360 VG)  In the\u00a0game, the player first sees Shu relaxing near Talta Village's windmill. Before the player officially starts the game he/she can have Shu move around to find a little Gold then go down the path with the game beginning. He along with Jiro and Kluke are the only ones in the village that don't run away from the Land Shark. Shu fights the Land Shark but to little effect even with help from Jiro finding the weak spot and his weapon broken. He later tries to fight using only a pocket knife and charging at the monster despite warnings not to. Shu is saved at the last minute by Kluke throwing a rock at the Land Shark causing it to change course. Shu with help from Jiro and Kluke later trap the Land Shark and attempt to destroy it. But the Land Shark breaks free. Shu tried to stop it by grabbing onto a pole attached to the wreckage the Land Shark was dragging with Jiro and Kluke holding onto him. After falling down a trench Shu wakes up Kluke and Jiro and fights Poo Snakes for the first time and finds treasure chests. When the last one is opened,\u00a0they're brought onto Nene's mothership by the land shark which is really a giant hammerhead shark-like mechat. They are brought to Nene where Shu charges at him after Nene says that he wanted to hear the village's screams but is clobbered by Nene's shadow, a red dragon. Shu and his friends are then dropped down a hole and out of the mothership. When Shu shouts his catchphrase they are mysteriously brought back into the ship. They find three light spheres and hear a\u00a0mysterious voice telling them to swallow the spheres. But unsure what to do they hold onto them. Then Mecha Robos appeared where they run away. Acting fast Shu closes the door keeping them from entering the room they're in. They find a Mechat but lack the power to activate it. The voice appears to them again telling them again to swallow the Light Spheres that will allow them to pilot the Mechat. Having no choice and the robots breaking down the door Shu, Jiro, and Kluke swallow the spheres while they were painful at first shadows appeared and took form. Using this new power they defeated some of the robots and Shu piloted the Mechat out of the mothership. However, Shu had a little difficulty piloting the craft and crashed. Shu and his friends got out before it exploded. They decided to get back to Talta Village to make sure everyone was alright. They encountered some monsters, a Sheep Tribe camp, and a giant drilling machine. Inside the machine\u00a0,they meet find keys to warp devices from a robot and at the control room a member of the Devee Tribe named Marumaro who was piloting the machine. Marumaro attacked Shu and his friends with his Saber Tiger Shadow but after seeing their shadows he stops and then the machine comes to an underground hospital. Marumaro quickly takes his leave and Shu and friends follow. When they finally meet up with Marumaro he is attacked by an Icefire Wolf Ghost. Shu and his friends destroy the monster and after a rather awkward introduction, they help Marumaro find medicine for his village. Shu however, is skeptical on whoever told Marumaro about the medicine but goes with it. At Lago Village they find that most of the Devee have been infected with a mysterious disease. But when the medicine doesn't work and Nene shows up revealing the medicine was for him before leaving Shu and co. attack but they are repelled and Nene leaves. Marumaro runs off crying and Shu and co. go after him. Shu encourages Marumaro not to give up and find a real cure. With many battles, they eventually find a leaf on a plant that can cure the Devee. During the night after the tribe took the medicine after Marumaro accidentally wakes Shu up, Shu notices that Jiro and Kluke aren't around. He goes out and notices them having a conversation if the medicine will work. The morning the medicine takes effect and the village is cured. Shu and co. leave the village with Marumaro joining them to get back to Talta Village. Unfortunately, there is no one left in the village. After checking each of their homes and fighting a monster called Mad Eye Shu finds a note from Fushira saying that the village is now going to Jibral. With no time to lose they pursue the people while going through Mural Valley and Mural Town seeing what had happened to the empire of the Ancients. They finally catch up with the people of Talta and fight off some Steel-Eating Tigers and a monster called Dullahan. Everyone then settles down at a camp for the night where Shu and Jiro spend time reunited with their families. Soon everyone moves out with Shu and co. protecting them from monsters. Soon they come across a swarm of Steel-Eating Tigers. While everyone loses hope Shu refuses to give in. They are later saved by King Jibral the sixteenth, his soldiers, and his Blade Master, Zola who like Shu and his friends wields a shadow, hers is Killer Bat. Then with everyone safe Shu and his friends explore Jibral. Later the king has Shu and co. come to him to explain the plan of attack on Nene. Shu eagerly accepts to help on the attack with his friends accepting as well. During the night Shu and Fushira are woken up by a storm from purple clouds, Nene was on the attack. Shu and co. go to Jibral Castle and witness the Tsunami Vortex being outdone by the Eternal Generator. With Nene's 'disastor' attack out of commission, his Flying Fortress descends. Harpoons were launched and Shu helps out pulling the chains to reel in the fortress. Shu and co. join Zola in an attempt to destroy the Eternal Engines. Along the way, they fight the Demon King Robots sent by General Szabo successfully defeating them and deactivating the Eternal Engines. When going for the last one Shu and co. split up with Zola. As she deactivates the Eternal Engine, Shu and co. witness Nene escape while fighting Szabo. They destroy Szabo then chase after Nene using a Mechat this time Shu flew it perfectly using his power. As the fortress is destroyed Shu and co. engage in a dogfight against Nene. While they succeed in damaging Nene's Mechat he escapes. After the battle Shu and co. celebrate but later decide to leave with Zola due to Nene being out and about in the north. Before leaving Shu and Jiro decides to give Kluke a ring for good luck, after seeing King Jibral give Zola the ring that has been past down in his family. It becomes a sort of friendly competition where they both worked with Jibral's Accessory Shop owner and made rings. Kluke couldn't decide and she chose to put on both rings. This caused both of them to be worn out after she left. Shu and co. help out the exiled giant named, Guru-Guru and his lover, Sura-Sura by clearing his name for a crime the chief of Alumaru Village, Jeelala had committed and framed Guru-Guru. In a difficult fight against a brainwashed Guru-Guru they manage to save him and reunite him with Sura-Sura. Later they stumble upon the Laser Field filled with moon shaped satellites shooting at them. They find shelter in an underground city called Baroy Town with help from friendly Ancient robots that have numbers for names. While looking at the temple they meet the friendly robot who guided them, Number 61. 61 explains that he and the other robot are waiting for their \"master\" who will appear on the screen in the temple. Soon they were all thrown out by the rather strict and mean Number 35 as they did not have authorization. When 61 comes out he explains how the robots change with personalities like humans. Shu then invents the names Yasato for 61 as he had a friendly personality and Hineto for 35 as he had a bad personality. Yasato liked his new name but Hineto did not and left. Yasato said he would like it if Shu and co. were his masters but Shu preferred to be friends as did the rest, except for the silent Zola. They went on to find a way outside to avoid the Moon Lasers. A gate is present but is blocked by a blue barrier. With help from Yasato they find the gate controller. Shu hit the device which activated it but from the atom-like machine near the controller came a Blazing Kirin. After defeating the monster the Blue Device they receive deactivated the gate's barrier as well as other blue barriers. Shu and co. go through the gate and come to the Underground River and later the Ancient Factory where War Mecha Robos are being produced. Barrier-type Mecha Robos then appear and attack them sensing their shadows. Unable to penetrate the red barriers they produce Shu and co. flee. Going further into the factory they find a malfunctioning Barrier Robo and took its device despite being broken. Shu and co. make it to the surface of the Wire Highlands only to be found by an entire army of Mecha Robos controlled by Nene. Fortunately, Jiro activated the barrier device shielding them. Shu then argues with Nene to fight himself but Nene has his Mecha Robos attack instead claiming that the planet belongs to him. Later he has the Robos from Baroy Town attack by becoming their new master. Not wanting to let them throw away their lives Shu is among the people to convince Jiro to deactivate the barrier. Shu and co. were then captured and brought to the Ancient Prison. At the prison, Yasato helped Shu escape and Shu acquires a Dungeon Key from a Security Mecha Robo and frees Jiro, Marumaro, and Zola. Later they find Kluke being taken away by Nene. Yasato helps out again but when he is about to have his memory chip taken by Nene, Shu springs into action, despite warnings. Jiro, Marumaro, and Zola follow and are attacked by Mecha Robos, to many to get to Nene. The Mecha Robos then come together to form into a giant Mecha Robo when it is about to move away Shu and co. grab onto it's feet but fall off when outside. Shu gives chase and has Blue Dragon attack the legs stopping the giant but Nene commands the smaller Mecha Robos to repair the damage and escaped. With no other options Shu and co. come to Pachess Town, a village imprisoned by a green barrier. As a result of coming in they too are imprisoned with no escape. The village at first after seeing Shu's shadow thought that they were with Nene. But after Zola showed the elder Jibral's ring the elder cleared them of their charges. Shu tried to break through the barrier again but to no avail. Frustrated with being unable to do anything Shu yelled at Marumaro after he said it was a bad idea to come to the town and got into an argument with Jiro about being worried about Kluke. As night came they makeup explaining what they feel about Kluke and with Marumaro and Zola find a building the elder kept secret via the vase in his room, an ancient machine, and a stone door. When went inside the building they found the elder and he explained the portrait explained the final days of the Ancients and the legend about the creature that they created which destroyed them and was then sealed away. When Marumaro accidentally activated the control for Moon Lasers Shu suggested they could use it to destroy the barrier and the Elder told them about Nene dropped the device down the shaft so that the village would figure it out for themselves. So they go in with the Elder wishing them luck. Eventually, they find the Green Device while battling several monsters including the keeper of the device, the Scything Skull-Spider. With the device in hand, the town was freed and the group travels on to find Kluke. When they find the giant Mecha Robo, Shu springs into action despite warnings from Jiro and Zola. The Mecha gets up from the sands and Nene and a regular Mecha Robo holding Kluke appear from the head. The Mecha Robo throws Kluke off and Jiro uses his Shadow to stir up a whirlwind to save her but overdid it. Shu then runs onto the Mecha Robo and saves Kluke, with more help from Jiro. But the reunion is short-lived when Nene reveals to have placed a bomb on Kluke that will explode in one hour. With no time to lose the Shu and co. dashed into Nene's Fortress. While there they fought against several opponents, such as the Land Shark, an upgraded Szabo and his upgraded henchman, the Moon Lasers, the Giant Mecha Robo, and regrettably Yasato. Shu utterly refused to fight Yasato and they instead destroyed the sweeper-like controller used on and used by Yasato. Shu and the others then went onward to Nene but Zola stayed behind to fight a damaged Szabo. Shu charged at Nene angered by his words of 'growing trials.' When Nene activated a switch that caused Kluke's collar to sprout three legs the others tried to pull them off but when their shadows came out and they started to feel pain the legs disappeared and everyone had Collars of Light put around their necks. When they sprouted legs Nene revealed he was using them to purify his soul by giving out portions of his soul by Light Spheres. When he took them back, recovered his youth, and proceeded to crush Shu and his friends with an ostrich-like mecha, Shu regained conscious with Nene commenting him on his strength after losing his shadow. Shu explained he still had strength and that he wouldn't give up. Nene proceeded to crush him but Shu regained Blue Dragon and with nothing else to do but run away to protect his friends, Shu warped them away saying that he will be back. Shu has a nightmare about losing his friends and the world to Nene and later wakes up in an old lady's house, learning that he was passed out for three days and that he and his friends were in Devour Village. While looking for his friends Shu talked to the villagers about their whereabouts, one girl about his age just didn't want to talk to him and shouted at him for continuously asking, and to leave her alone. When finding his friends Shu and his friends discussed on what happened back at Nene's Fortress and Shu explains that he was able to use his shadow for a short while and explaining that running away isn't always bad. When hearing that the village has been in terror because of the Eat Yeet, Shu attempted to fight against it using his shadow, to no avail. Then Shu heard of Kluke's illness and attempted to remove the good luck ring he made for her, believing that it isn't working. But Jiro told him that because of those rings Kluke believed they would be reunited. Shu decided to go outside to see the eight moons aligned on the horizon near the cliffs, despite hearing that something bad will happen. At the cliffs, he notices the girl his age, Sahlia as she tries to fall off the cliff. Shu saves her, despite her protests. He then argues with her, telling what happened to her parents because of the Eat Yeet. Shu protests by telling her his and his friends' struggles of losing their families. He also explains how he won't give up. Shu then attempted to get his shadow back, putting more will into and succeeding, destroying the collar still on him and gaining the Corporeal attack after defeating a copy of Blue Dragon. With his power returned he cures Kluke and destroys the Eat Yeet. When Shu and co. leave the village Sahlia comes and gives them some cookies. Marumaro asked that if Sahlia liked Shu, which Shu hit Marumaro in the head for. Sahlia replied that she respects him. As she left Shu is teased by his friends if he likes Sahlia, to which he angrily replies to 'just knock it off!' As Shu's friends regain their shadows they acquire the White Device and save Noluta Village. Soon they meet up with Zola again in the Great Desert and explain how they regained their shadows. They went off and noticed the large glass pillars digging their way through the planet splitting it in half and cubes floating around in the center. Nene then appears and announces himself as ruler of the world while explaining the planet's true form. Shu and co. go off to stop him. Upon finding Nene, he offers Shu to become his successor, Shu utterly refuses and Nene tries to take away his shadow again but he finds out Shu made Blue Dragon his own. Shu and co. then fight Nene which started with them having the disadvantage\u00a0until Szabo uses Nene's mirrors against him and they are able to defeat him. But Nene keeps on fighting as Ultimate Nene but ended up defeated again. Shu and co. find out that Zola had been working for Nene and tried to fight her but couldn't. After Zola betrayed and destroyed Nene, Shu and co. had a bigger problem, Nene's pet Deathroy assumed his true form, Destroy. Together they destroyed Destroy and with a device that Shu activated, restored the world. After the battle, Shu goes to one of the Cube Worlds on the Mechat and finds a Rare Flower and goes to Kluke's birthday party giving the flower to her as a gift. When Jiro and Shu ask Kluke who she likes and she asks that if they could wait until her next birthday, they both screamed 'No!' Shu and his friends are then seen laughing at the end of the game.Blue Dragon anime  At the start of the series, Shu is seen with his friends wandering around town with random people to see where the Knight Master is. His best friend Kluke always tells him that his plans are a waste of time. Shu then runs into Jiro, a kid who has the power of a shadow. Before Jiro has the chance to release it, Zola then appears to stop him from doing anything rational. At that point, Shu thought that Zola was a Knight Master, but reveals to Shu that she isn't one. Later, Nene's forces strike Talta Village in search for the shadow Blue Dragon. Nene's soldiers then took Shu's friends as hostages, but Shu continues to fight back but ends up getting in the way. Zola and Jiro unleash their shadows and fight against the soldiers, but then suddenly out of courage and determination, releases the Blue Dragon shadow out from within him. Blue Dragon then gets out of control, dragged Shu around, which Shu then notices his shadow is out of control. Before setting off, Kluke decides to go along as well. After the attack on Talta Village, Zola explains to Shu that if he stays there, his village will be in danger. Shu got scared at first, then ran off. Nene's troops attacked the village again, but this time Zola and Jiro were ready. After the troops are fended off, Shu decides to come along with Zola and Jiro on their journey.Blue Dragon Trials of the Seven Shadows  2 years later after the end of the first season, Shu and Bouquet have joined the resistance against General Logi. They then find a boy named Noi and the Red Dragon. With Noi's help, he reawakens Shu's Blue Dragon shadow. In this season is shown to have a crush on Bouquet. But episode 30 and 35, it becomes clear that he loves Kluke very much.Quotes Trivia Navigation  Template:BD CharactersZola  Zola (\u30be\u30e9 Zora) is the tritagonist and one of the main characters in the Blue Dragon universe. In both the game and anime, she had a previous affiliation with the Gran Kingdom before switching sides, only with a shocking plot twist in the anime.History Shadow  Zola is the owner of the shadow, Killer Bat.Synopsis Video Game  Zola is a playable character in Blue Dragon and Blue Dragon Plus. A former mercenary serving as the leader of King Jibral's Blademasters. She is the only character besides Shu whose Shadow uses a visible weapon, and never loses her Shadow. Zola is first introduced in the story when Shu, Jiro and Kluke find light spheres aboard the Flying Fortress. It is her voice, on Nene's command, that orders them to swallow the spheres. Zola makes her first appearance and can be played as first when the traveling survivors of Talta Village are attacked on their way to Jibral. She is among the warriors with King Jibral and joins Shu, Jiro, Kluke and Marumaro in battling the group of Steel-eating Tigers. She then leads the group in their mission to shut down Nene's Flying Fortress which they accomplish while Shu and his friends battle General Szabo. Zola then helps King Jibral and his army escape the base before it crashes with Shu and his friends follow in a stolen mechat moments later. Zola fades slightly in her storyline role when Kluke is abducted by Nene. The party rescues Kluke from Nene's bomb, but were pursued later by Szabo's remains before reaching Nene's room. Zola holds off Szabo while the others defeat Nene, but lose their Shadows in the process. They escape with Zola regrouping with them a short time later, and try to regain their magic. They witness the planet being split and reformed thanks to Nene's tampering with the Ancient's technology. After making their way into the masses of cube worlds that spill out from the planet, they find the cube Nene is based at. After battling their way through swathes of enemies, they finally reach and defeat Nene twice. Nene lies amidst the ruins of his battle suit and then asks Zola.Anime  Zola serves as the leader of the protagonists' group, being the most mature and intelligent. She and Jiro arrives at Shu's village, where her keen senses and expert swordsmanship brought Shu to mistook her as a Blademaster. After fending off one of Nene's raid on the village, she reintroduces herself to Shu as a descendant of the Seven Soldiers of Light and their mission to find the missing descendants in order to defeat Nene. It was only after Nene's death that Zola's true intentions for gathering the Shadow Wielders were revealed...the evil within Killer Bat corrupts Zola causing her to unleash the darkness that plagued the world. While Shu still believed Zola still has good within, he discovers the reason because Killer Bat chasing out her \"good-side\" since the cave-in that killed her father. With her good separated from Zola, she became the true evil and avatar of the legendary darkness. Killer Bat then merges with Zola to form a demonic version of her. With the help of the other light descendants, Shu was able to vanquish the Demon Zola, destroying Killer Bat once and for all. Afterwards while the others struggle to seal the darkness, Zola appears before Shu one last time smiling; speculation implies that although she released it, she became glad that for Shu's development of character.Trial of the Seven Shadows  However, it would be later revealed in the second series that only the darkness within Zola died. The good within her (which was driven off by Killer Bat) was found by White Guardians leader Dr. Tarkovsky who implanted the light into a homunculus, whom the latter took in as his own granddaughter named Primella.Relationships Shu  In the game, he is impressed by her skills and respected her actions, although like the others, he was just as shocked when everyone found out she had been working for Nene. In the anime, she arrives at his village and after defeating Gran Kingdom soldiers she told him to come with her. Like the game, he was quite aggrieved at her betrayal of their trust and friendship. However, Shu still stubbornly willing to go to greater lengths to confront her of her mistakes as he still believes that there is still good in left in her and because he believed that she truly consider him and the others as friend. After successfully defeating her, he then quickly forgives her of her mistakes due to the fact that he values her their friendship much more. Zola respects Shu's determination and sometimes his stubbornness in his tendency to save that world as she might regard this as one of the most important qualities in an individual. Zola strongly believes in his potential capability to do so. She felt a pleasured satisfaction for him achieving his goals as she displayed a genuine smile before departing to the afterlife.Jiro  In the game, she doesn't interact much with Jiro, although he was the one who figured out Nene was using her power as insurance to his own. In the anime, Zola was the one who found Jiro after his village was destroyed. He traveled with her and she taught him swordsmanship and possibly hand to hand combat skills in which he wielded professionally. This was further demonstrated in season 2. They are the closest in the anime. Their relationship seems to demonstrate a sisterly-brotherly relationship. However, when Jiro can't control his emotions she usually tells him off, like at the end of Season 1.Kluke  In the game not much is known about their relationship, However, in the anime. Zola acts like a motherly figure to her, like in episode 3. She admired and complimented her of her compassionate personality and encourages her to continue her acts of compassion. As she had once told her \"you're a kind person and that one-day kindness will become your greatest strengths\".Marumaro  In the game, she seems to like him despite his loud shouts at her and his continual saying of \"LOVE!\" Like the time she kissed his forehead to make some girls leave him alone. In the anime, she is the one who lets Marumaro free after the group captures him. She also allows him to join the group despite his perverted actions.Quotes Trivia Bouquet  'Bouquet' (\u30d6\u30fc\u30b1 buuke) is an anime-only character in the Blue Dragon anime and metaseries created by Hironobu Sakaguchi and characters drawn by Akira Toriyama. Bouquet is one of the main characters in the Blue Dragon universe.Overview  Bouquet is an exclusive character to the anime. In the original version, Bouquet has an overall fan-service appearance, in that her breasts are very large. This is censored in the English Broadcast versions, with smaller breasts, instead of the actual breast size in the original version. Being a member of the Ra Clan, Bouquet has the ability to become invisible, but must strip in order to be completely unseen, which is edited out in the dub where she is depicted as being able to turn invisible whenever she wants. On one occasion, she was somehow detected by Delphinium and later by Investiture beings.Appearance  Bouquet has a round face with a light-tan complexion, small round lavender eyes, mid-back gray/black hair that's pulled up into high pigtails on the sides of her head. She has two long strands of hair that usually fall in front of her eyes. In season 1, she wears a light blue, short dress which is covered up by her white apron; around her neck is a thick blue collar. The dress seems to come as \"tight\" and makes Bouquet's chest stand out. This also shows she has large breasts (despite her young\u00a0age). She wears thigh-high skin tight socks and blue flats with a lavender fold. Around her forearms are blue \"sweat bands\" that start near the elbow and end at the wrist. In season two she wears a pink halter top with an odd three-hexagonal shaped pattern on her chest. She wears a dark pink sash around her waist, a short pink miniskirt, dark pink short shorts underneath, \"forearm-warmers\" (refer to last sentence in above paragraph), dark pink leg-warmers that stop at the intersection of her thigh and lower leg, and brown flats with a white fold.Powers  Bouquet has the power to turn herself invisible, but (in the uncut) must strip to become invisible to the naked eye. In the dub, all she does is untie her apron and she disappears with \"sparkles\" covering her body. She also has the power to summon her Shadow and transform into anything she sees. Later in the series she also gets the power to copy an enemies attack. In Tenkai no Shichi Ryuu, she gains the power to merge with someone else and their Shadow thanks to Noi's power. She transforms into a pink sphere, which needs to be grabbed by the one she's merging with.Blue Dragon (anime)  Shu and the others first encountered her in a restaurant as a waitress where she was being harrassed by two customers that Shu and Zola fended off. After losing her job, she follows Shu to Jibral and Gran Kingdom until she later joins their group, quickly developing romantic feelings for Shu. After asking Shu many questions, all to which he replies \"yes\" with, she asks him to marry her and provides the same answer, not realizing the question until after he says it. She then teases him and Kluke by saying he is her fianc\u00e9, which makes Shu and Kluke angry. She is eventually allowed to join the group, though she gets into conflicts with Kluke because they both have feelings for Shu, though Kluke refuses to admit hers (Bouquet is still aware of them regardless). She is hated by Cynthia after some of the soldiers in Gran Kingdom's army called Bouquet the prettiest girl in the world when she showed off her looks to them (the plan was something Marumaro came up with to have some fun with an easy fight). Bouquet was soon sent on a mission to retrieve seven legendary pages. After solving her page she gained the power to copy any attack which was used on her, and she is able to defeat Szabo.Blue Dragon: Tenkai no shichi ryu  Two years later, she and Shu are working in a resistance against General Logi. Although it has been two years Bouquet is still chasing Shu and trying to win his affection, with Marurmaro trying to get a little love from Bouquet of course. They meet Noi and her Shadow was reawakened. Shortly after, Noi gives her and her Shadow the ability to merge with Shu and Blue Dragon. She also developes a friendship with Lota, and later on she and Shu save her from Rudolf.Relationships Shu  She first met Shu when he saved her from being harassed by two men at the restaurant. When Bouquet saw Shu after this heroic display, it was love at first sight. She asked if she could join their team, but Zola says it's up to Shu. The latter declines at the end and urges Zola to speed up the wagon so they can escape Bouquet. Not willing to give up, Bouquet chases after the group. She returns in episode 9 and starts this habit of pulling Shu into her chest, something that angers Kluke to no end. Towards the end of this episode, she is able to \"trick\" Shu into marrying her. She's seen throughout season 1 trying to hog his attention, declaring that she is indeed his fiancee. In Tenkai, her relationship with Shu seems to have grown, as Shu doesn't seem to avoid her as much, and also appears that Shu may have the same feelings as her. In episode 14 when Bouquet asks Shu why he dreams of Primella and not her, Shu replies, \"I can't help it since it's a dream. I thought you wouldn't mind such trivial matters.\" to which Bouquet responds, \"I don't mind.\" causing Maru to whisper, \"I think she really does mind.\"Kluke  Their relationship isn't close. Kluke stuck up for Bouquet in episode 6 when Marumaro was trying to grope her. However in episode 9, the two sorta clashed over Shu; starting a love triangle. She was very angry when Bouquet was able to get Shu to agree to their marriage. In season 1, the two are seen fighting over Shu and seem to cooperate a bit better after episode 34. In Tenkai no Shichi Ryuu, their relationship isn't as hostile. In fact, Bouquet seems to\u00a0let go of\u00a0any jealousy towards Kluke by episode 30. Kluke also doesn't seem to\u00a0have any jealousy towards Bouquet anymore. She also greatly cares for Kluke,\u00a0as seen when\u00a0she\u00a0and Marumaro went to Kluke's village to save her from Rotta.Jiro  The two don't really interact that much and the only time that they do, is when Jiro's mocking Shu, causing Bouquet to react to his rudeness in Shu's defense. In Tenkai no Shichi Ryuu, not much is known about their relationship.Zola  Much like her relationship with Jiro, Bouqet and Zola rarely interact with one another. However, much like the others, Bouquet did doubt Zola's actions towards the end of the season.Marumaro  Bouquet doesn't really like Marumaro, for she's usually the target of his perverted actions in both season 1 and Tenkia no Shichi Ryuu.Andropov  The don't interact often, but, along with Marumaro, holds him back when he tries to fight Zola in season one. She also breaks up his and Shu's fight later in season two and pulls him and Marumaro away from Shu and Kluke so that they can be alone together.Friends/Allies Enemies/Rivals Quotes  \"But I know you didn't mean it. Don't be embarrassed, just be honest!\" - episode 9 \"You have no right to speak to me like that, Kluke!\" -episode 34 \"I will help! I...\" - episode 34Trivia Kluke  Kluke (\u30af\u30eb\u30c3\u30af Kurukku)\u00a0is the heroine in the Blue Dragon universe. She is a childhood friend of Shu and Jiro in the game, while just Shu's childhood friend in the anime.Biography Game  In the game, Kluke grew up with her friends Shu and Jiro in Talta Village. She lost her parents to the land shark a year\u00a0prior to the start of the game. Kluke is dragged along on an adventure with Shu and Jiro when the boys set up a trap for the Land Shark. When she arrives on Nene's fleet for the first time, she gains her Shadow, a blue Phoenix. In Lago Village, she identifies the cure for the sickness (A Gabo Leaf) contaminating Marumaro's villagers and family. Because her parents were doctors, Kluke wishes to become a doctor as well and has an understanding in medicine and (most likely) first aid. Later in the game, she is captured by Nene and used as bait to trap Shu and the others. A \"bomb collar\" is strapped around her neck and \"within one hour, it will explode\", thus adding further stress onto the group and Kluke herself. She, like everybody else, soon learns how to master the Corporeal form of her Shadow and from there continues her adventure. At the very end of the game, they (basically every important minor character) celebrate her birthday. Shu and Jiro confront her, asking her to choose who she likes more to which she responds, \"Can you guys wait until my uh, my next birthday?\". She is seen once again laughing along with Shu and Jiro as the camera zooms away from the New World.Anime  Kluke is very different in the anime than she is in the game. She still grew up in Talta, only this time with Shu and three other boys. Though feisty and constantly hitting Shu (albeit having a crush on him), she really does care for her friends despite her outbursts. She is the last to obtain her Shadow (episode 14) and even then, she expresses concern about feeling \"useless\". Just like in the game, however, she did lose her parents prior the episode one, but it's never revealed how they died. When she was younger, she had Shu to comfort her and vice versa, since he too lost his parents to an unknown catastrophe. In contrast to the game, Kluke is a gifted mechanic, able to operate and fix any machines she comes across. She also has a slight obsession with machines. Whether this likeness for machines was brought on by a former parent's career choice or job is unknown. But Kluke's tinkering has come in handy for the gang many times on their quest. Kluke's personality is that of a tsundere in the first season of the anime.Trials of the Seven Shadows  Season 2 Kluke is a lot more calmer than season 1. She is a very mature and wise person for someone of 12 years old, and this was probably spurred on by the events of the first season. She has grown to dislike fighting and works at a hospital, tending to the survivors of the war against the darkness. Aside from working at\u00a0the hospital, Kluke \"babysits\" the children from the village, most of\u00a0who have lost their parents in the war.\u00a0She lives with Andropov and assists in helping him recover. Like everyone else, she has no Shadow and she uses this as an excuse to ward Shu off when he comes to recruit her for the Resistance. Eventually, she does end up assisting everyone after her Shadow is resurrected when she protects Andropov.Appearance Game  In the game, Kluke dons a plain black dress with collar neck and no sleeves which includes\u00a0a yellow sash tied around her waist. She wears magenta sweatbands and matching socks, small brown boots with a tan overhang, and a magenta colored bow in her hair. Her skin is slightly tan in contrast to her anime counterpart. She has brown hair and brown eyes. A fringe, or bangs, hangs in a somewhat arc shape in front of her right eye, often mistaken for hanging in front of her left eye. The bangs are present in all of her appearances so far.Anime  Kluke dresses the same attire as her game counterpart only a different color palette. Also, her physical features have been altered just slightly. Her hair is auburn brown, a lighter shade than her game counterpart, a slightly paler skin complexion, and green eyes. Her dress is a light pink, the bow is yellow rather magenta, and her boots are white with a yellow overhang.Trials of the Seven Shadows  Her outfit differs from the game and anime in season 2. She wears a\u00a0white undershirt with a long-sleeved, bare shoulder light blue shirt with dark blue encircling the cuffs. She wears blue shorts with a light blue (the same color as her overshirt) skirt with dark blue trim. Her boots are slightly longer and grey with a matching overhang. The only thing present from her last clothing would be her yellow sash. Kluke's physical appearance remained the same for the most part, but her hair is slightly longer, she no longer wears a ribbon in her hair, now has small breasts,\u00a0and her face seems longer as well.Personality Game  Kluke is a very mature person beyond her age. She is caring, maternal, and always ready to help anyone in need. However, as revealed by Jiro in a cutscene, Kluke had a habit of running off somewhere alone and breaking down into tears. Haunted by the deaths of her parents, she would replay the scenes in her head until she cried. Shu knew about this and confronted Jiro, concerned, but nobody confronted her until Jiro was with Kluke. He told her it was okay to cry, and it's implied she took that advice in Devour Village. There are times where she outright teases Shu, but not out of malice, but more of a brother-sister sort of way.Anime  Her personality was altered greatly come anime. She became feisty, energetic, but very kind and to an extent, a tsundere (can be himedere sometimes). She started out in the series carrying around a gun that shot pink fists and rode a motorscooter, both of which weren't present in the game. She seems to know nothing about medicine or healing in general in contrast to the game. Kluke has a bad habit of hurting Shu and Marumaro physically, and she also has somewhat of a competition with Bouquet as they both like Shu. Kluke is extremely jealous of Bouquet's relationship with Shu, but she'd never admitted this (more emphasis on her tsundere personality). However, despite most of her flaws, she generally is a caring person shown immediately in episode 2 where she hugs Shu after he bails out of the house after arguing with Zola.Trials of the Seven Shadows  Mirroring most of her game personality, Kluke is a wise person. She actually seems more mature than her game counterpart, but this could be due to the timed passed between season 1 and 2. Kluke has become more maternal and loving, much like her Shadow. She does not physically punch Shu or Marumaro, but she still maintains some of her sly side. She still cares for\u00a0Shu as shown in episode 30 but she does not show it like season 1. It becomes clear in episode 43 when she said emotionally he must come back safely from Zemy. Kluke seems to have lost all malice for Bouquet and no longer cares about the relationship between Bouquet and Shu since she's busy with the hospital, children, and Andropov. In this season, Kluke and Shu are more than just childhood friends because the both of them will share the same romantic feelings that they share and they will love each other.Shadow  Kluke's Shadow is \u00a0Phoenix. In the game, Phoenix is not known to talk, like every other Shadow. However, she does have a talent for the Black Magic class, elements and shadow magic. In the anime, Phoenix is capable of speaking and is very motherly and supportive\u00a0to Kluke and the others. Phoenix is capable of using barrier magic (Feather Protect) and teleportation and possess no skills over any elements. She is not a combat Shadow as shown in the game, but rather a supportive one instead. In the anime, Phoenix is voiced by Michelle Ruff, Kluke's anime voice actress.Trivia Shadows  Shadows\u00a0are\u00a0magical powers that manifest the wielder's shadow into powerful corporeal creatures. Shadows are referenced throughout Blue Dragon as \"magic power\" or just as shadows. People who wield these shadows are called Shadow Wielders.Video Games  Shadows are a form of power used by Ancients from their times that creates Soul Light, the power of emotion which then generate a shadow. After most of the shadows were eliminated by Deathroy, they never appeared again until Nene revealed himself. In the game events, Nene used five parts of his tainted soul as Light Spheres for consumption to obtain fighting and growing power, and curing his illness. He succeded in obtaining four of his scattered Light Spheres but Shu and his friends managed to make the shadows they obtained their own. Zola, the first among the people who obtained a shadow had already expelled Nene's power a long time ago and made Killer Bat her own. In Blue Dragon Plus, multiple characters have obtained or gained Shadows during their quest to destroy the Balaur, especially enemies in the mysterious cube including machines. By Blue Dragon: Awakened Shadow, nearly all lifeforms gained shadows becaming a part of their lives. However, the appearance of the Egg of Light, it absorbed the people's shadows. Luckily for the protagonist, he/she was able to keep his/her shadow and was able to share it in different forms with the other characters. Shadows are differentiated by their color, blue shadows (with the light attribute in the Blue Dragon TCG) are used by characters that use it for good. Purplish-red shadows (with the dark attribute in the Blue Dragon TCG) are used by characters who use them for evil purposes.Anime  In the anime, only the Seven Soldiers of Light and their descendants are able to wield true shadows, while most characters wield artificial shadows. These shadows have their own individual character and personalities of their own, compared to the games where shadows are just extensions of the wielder. It is revealed that shadows were once beings from the darkness until they were merged into beings from the light as shadows.Artificial Shadows  Through special machines in Gran Kingdom, artificial shadows are able to be created, while these shadows have personalities similar to real shadows, they are not as powerful and lack some of the abilities real shadows have (e.g. merging with their wielder).False Shadows  As seen with Zola and Killer Bat, Shadows with powers similar to real shadows but lack personalities exist after the wielder had absorbed some form of power (for example darkness) and is released in the form as one's own inner will.Other Shadows  From the darkness, shadow-like creatures appear and can absorb lifeforms just through touch. Investure Beings can use their dragon forms in the form of shadows and with some items like a Dragon Scale shadows as powerful as real ones can form from a person.Abilities  Shadows are acquired by Shu and his friends in Blue Dragon by swallowing light orbs which were actually Nene's soul. These granted them the power of Shadows. Each Shadow is different and manifests itself according to its user. Shadows grant their wielders immense strength, such as the ability to cast spells or attack with strength beyond that of a normal warrior. They also allow their users to fly mechats and operate ancient machines by using their immense power. Shadow Wielders can also use other classes onto their shadows, or alternatively use sealed shadows or shadows shared with another wielder to use other classes. Once Shu and his friends stop relying on Nene's soul, their Shadows can also use extremely powerful attacks, known as Corporeal attacks. During this phase, a Shadow temporarily becomes a real creature. This attack is more powerful than any other attack used by Shadows. Corporeal attacks also convert this damage into MP for their wielder. Shadows can also fuse with others as shown on Chimera as well as their own Shadow Wielders once their soul light has been honed to the limit. In the anime, shadows were passed down for generations and awaken when their current owner is in a dire situation. Shu, Kluke, Jiro, Marumaro and Bouquet master the ability to call their respective shadows forth in short time. Eventually, it was revealed Zola was manipulating events behind the scenes as she noticed the kids' shadows as the genuine shadows from real time.Classes  Shadows have various classes in Blue Dragon and can easily switch between them.Known Shadows Games and Anime Games Only Anime Only Blue Dragon  Blue Dragon (\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3 Buru Doragon) is a Japanese RPG developed by Mistwalker and Artoon and distributed by Microsoft Game Studios exclusively for the Xbox 360. It was based on a design by Final Fantasy series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi, who also supervised development and wrote the plot. The game was released in Japan on December 7, 2006, in Europe on August 24, 2007 and in North America on August 28, 2007. The game follows the story of five friends: Shu, Jiro, Kluke, Zola, and Marumaro, as they travel across the world to confront the evil King of the Grand Kingdom, Nene. The setting inspired separate anime and manga adaptations, although these follow the story to different degrees and feature a different cast of characters. The game follows a traditional role-playing design, based around exploration and turn-based combat, with turn speed modified by characters' agility. Blue Dragon is the first Xbox 360 title to make use of three disks. It was also the longest Xbox 360 game until Lost Odyssey was released with a story spanning four disks. Overall, the game has received a positive reception, with an average score of 77% on the review aggregator website Game Rankings. Blue Dragon was both applauded and criticized for its excellent adaptation of the traditional elements of role-playing games. In Japan, Blue Dragon was sold both as a stand-alone game and in a bundle with the Xbox 360 (including the game, the Xbox 360 system itself, and a Blue Dragon faceplate).Gameplay  The battle style is more traditional than many modern console role-playing games, because the game uses turn-based combat and a number of genre-standard elements. The game world consists of a mix of towns and dungeon-like areas, with the former having places to rest and purchase items, while the latter contains numerous foes to be defeated. Shortly after the beginning sections of the game, players gain the ability to \"warp\" to locations which they have previously visited, greatly reducing the amount of time spent wandering on foot.Shadows  The core mechanicis the use of magical blue Shadows, with each player character having a distinct shadow modeled after either a Dragon, a Phoenix, a bat, a minotaur, a sabretooth, or a bat. Each Shadow can be assigned to a single character class (from a number of such classes) at a time, taking on the attributes and abilities of that class. Class Experience points or \"ranks\" are earned only for the active class, but players are free to change classes at any time except in combat, allowing the group's Shadows to be customized in order to achieve the desired combination. As Shadows increase in rank in a given class, they learn new skills, which can then be assigned to a limited number of skill slots. Shadows can be assigned previously learned skills regardless of their current class. For example, if a Shadow is currently set to be an \"Assassin\", but has previously learned the ability to cast \"Barrier Magic\" while acting as a member of that class, the \"Barrier Magic\" skill can be set as an active skill. This allows mixing or hybridization, with the player able to pick and choose from among the skills known to a given shadow.Combat  Although combat in the game follows a strictly turn-based formula, the turn sequence of the combatants is calculated based on the agility of the character, and characters are allowed to take multiple turns before enemies can act if they are sufficiently quick. Different actions take different periods of time, so the turn order is not fixed even within a given combat session. One gameplay addition which adds to combat strategy is the \"Charge Meter\", which allows players to \"charge up\" spells or attacks by spending additional time preparing them. This meter is always used for spellcasting, as well as when using the \"Charge Attack\" skill of the \"Monk\" class. Although players can choose to act immediately, an ability will become more effective the longer that the player charges it. Depending on the ability, this will result in more damage or a greater area of effect. However, the greater the amount of time one charges, the greater the time before the next turn. As a result of this, players can choose to charge up an ability so that the ability triggers shortly before an enemy acts, or can instead aim for a special \"red area\" on the bar indicating an ideal charge. Overall, deciding on the correct amount of charge (and letting go of the button at precisely that time) can greatly influence the effectiveness of each character's attacks during combat.Plot Characters  The five main characters of Blue Dragon are: Both Shu and Kluke's parents were killed by the \"Land Shark\". Shu now lives with his grandfather Fushira, the village blacksmith. Shu thinks of both Jiro and Kluke as good friends. Jiro has feelings for Kluke, but does not reveal them to her. Marumaro has a crush on Zola (because her Shadow looks like a Devee god) and openly expresses this throughout the story. The antagonists are:Disc 1  Blue Dragon takes place in a fictional open-world environment where every year for the past ten years, purple clouds have mysteriously appeared in the sky, signaling misfortune and disaster for people across the world. For years, a terrifying beast dubbed the \"Land Shark\", came with the purple clouds, killing thousands of people and destroying a number of villages. At the beginning of the story, once again the purple clouds have arrived in Talta Village. As the clouds engulf the village, the villagers rush to seek shelter. Among them is Fushira, the grandfather of Shu. As he arrives at an emergency evacuation area, he asks the villagers if they've seen Shu, but none of them have. Then, as Fushira attempts to leave the area, he discovers friends Shu and Jiro confronting the Land Shark within the heart of the village. Working together, Shu and Jiro slow down the land shark, but encounter troubles and find themselves saved by Kluke. Together, the three lead the Land Shark into a net trap that they had previously set up and Shu closes in for the kill. However, as Shu approaches, the Land Shark breaks free from the net and rushes away, with Shu, Jiro and Kluke dangling from its back. The three friends are dragged into an area of ancient ruins which they briefly explore. Shu discovers that the Land Shark wasn't actually a shark, but a machine called a \"mechat\". Once more, the mechat comes to life, only this time sailing into the sky, again carrying the three with it. The party arrives at a giant mechat base in the clouds and are tossed into the throne room of Nene, the apparent leader by Szabo, his robotic general. Nene explains to them how he enjoys hearing the screams of the dying victims of the Land Shark. Outraged, the party confronts Nene in battle, but is easily defeated. They are thrown out of the base and start to fall to their deaths, but Shu's determination saves their lives, with him shouting that he \"will never give up\". The party awakens back in the base. They then find three floating spheres in the middle of the room, where a voice commands, \"Eat the spheres\". The party refuses and is forced to fight an army of Nene's robots. As they attempt to flee, they discover another mechat, which is their last hope of escape. Given no other choice, and with the unseen voice promising them knowledge of how to pilot the mechat, the party eats the spheres. As they consume the spheres, a strange transformation occurs to each, changing the forms of their shadows. Shu's turns into a blue dragon, Jiro's, a blue minotaur, and Kluke's, a blue phoenix. They escape the base in a mechat (which the Shadows make possible to pilot) and crash in a desert. The three friends then begin the journey back to Talta Village on foot. Along the way, Jiro finds that his Shadow, the Minotaur, is skilled at using healing magic, while Shu and Kluke cannot. Eventually, they see a storm of dirt and a series of large holes in the ground around them. After traversing the wilderness battling monsers with their Shadows and learning their new capabilities, they discover the Dill Machine as the source of all the holes and sandstorm. Recognizing Nene's symbol on the machine, they make up their minds to be careful of the inhabitants and to try to use it to get back to Talta. On board, they find only robots. When they reach the cockpit, with a voice shouting through the sealed door, \"Don't you dare mess with Maro\". The party unlocks the door and confronts Marumaro, a Devee tribe member who denies working with Nene. He attacks the three friends, who are startled to see that the Devee has a Shadow too, in the shape of a tiger. After a short battle, Maromaro flees into a hospital which the drill machine had burrowed to. Shu, Jiro, and Kluke follow him and eventually find the small warrior fighting alone against a giant wolf monster. After the party defeats the wolf and saves Marumaro, he allows them to help him. He reveals that Nene forced him to swallow a light sphere to save the Devee tribe, who are seriously ill. After finding the required medicine, they journey to the Devee city, Lago Village. After they use the medicine, it worsens the tribe's condition. Nene arrives and reveals he wanted the medicine for himself. After repelling the outraged party, he leaves. Shu and co. then agree to help Marumaro find the real cure, which Kluke reveals thanks to her parents being medical experts. After they acquire it, they return and heal the Devee tribe. Marumaro then joins Shu to help in the fight against Nene and to get revenge for his tribe. After they travel back to Talta, they find a horrible truth out: the villagers left the village due to the Land Shark. Monsters have overrun it and the village is in ruins. They find a letter from Fushira that tells them to go to Jibral, where the survivors of Talta Village were heading. The group leaves the village and takes a shortcut in an attempt to catch up to the villagers. They find a town of enchanted murals along the way that provides them with insight on the ancient civilization that created the murals. When they finally catch up to the villagers, Shu, Jiro, Kluke and Marumaro use their Shadows to repel some Steel-eating Tigers that were molesting the villagers. The villagers are amazed at the power that the party now possess. After they save the villagers, Shu, Jiro and Kluke reunite with their family and friends. The four party members then assist in protecting the vulnerable caravans the villagers travel in. Eventually, the traveling procession is attacked and surrounded by a mass of Steel-eating Tiger enemies. Fortunately, King Jibral and a group of his soldiers help the village. Among their ranks is a talented swordfighter named Zola. Zola then reveals her ability to wield a Shadow. The party joins her in confronting a group of Steel-eating Tigers. Marumaro develops a crush on her and Zola reveals her past to the party. Talta Village is then escorted to Jibral Castle Town. The party has an audience with King Jibral, whom they notify of Nene's existence. King Jibral knows of the violet clouds, which affect his kingdom as well as Talta and Lago. He agrees to attack Nene's giant Flying Fortress, providing that the party is willing to assist in the battle. After they agree the battle commences with the destruction of a nearby ancient cube Nene uses to flood Jibral. This brings out Nene and the Jibral army hook his fortress with harpoons and anchor it down. The boarding parties then attack the Flying Fortress. The party is joined by Zola, who explains that they need to enter the flying fortress and destroy its Eternal Engines. Along the way, the party is attacked by minions of General Szabo, each with their own element and powers. These are Silent Ku, Heatwave Sai, and other such elementals. With Zola added to their numbers, the party easily defeats the robotic minions. Along the way, they shut of the fortresses' multiple engines. They eventually come to a room with two teleporters. Zola takes one and the remainder of the party takes the other. Zola arrives in the room with the final Eternal Engine. She shuts it off and returns to the place where the boarding parties landed. Shu and his friends find Nene and Szabo near a mechat, which Nene exits the base in shortly after. Shu, Jiro Kluke and Marumaro then fight Szabo, who prevents them from pursuing their enemy. After destroying Szabo, the party commandeer a mechat and follow Nene. They succeed in damaging Nene's vehicle but lose him in the violet clouds. Meanwhile, Zola tells the Jibral soldiers to exit the Flying Fortress, which crashes into the water and sinks below the sea. All the inhabitants and staff of Jibral then attend a party. To follow this, King Jibral gives them the assignment to track down Nene. He sends Zola to aid the party in these exploits.Disc 2  After the celebrations end, Shu and his friends, now accompanied by Zola, travel to the north of the planet, where Nene was last seen traveling toward. To do this they must cross a dangerous wasteland called the Laser Fields. Filled with monsters and explosive elements, the place was rarely traversed except in emergencies. After traveling about halfway across the Fields, there are sudden laser blasts that begin to rain down upon the surface. These come from moons that have been modified with machinery to blend in, then attack unsuspecting enemies. The malfunctioning moons start to attack Shu and friends who run toward a mound in the distance, which has a hand waving to them. When they leap in, they find themselves in a city of robots. These robots were built by the ancients to serve various purposes and have built a replica of an ancient town called Baroy Town When the companions attempt to buy items or rest at inns, they must use computer terminals. Apparently, the robotic citizens of Baroy town have been awaiting the return of the one they call master for centuries. The party strikes up a friendship with a robot designated Sixty-one, who shows them the temple that their master lives. The companions note Nene's symbol on the communicator device shown in the temple before being thrown out by a bad-tempered robot designated Thirty-five. After this, Shu names the two robots Yasato and Hineto (in order of appearance) to the derision of his friends. The companions cannot leave Baroy Town the way they came due to lasers, so they search for an alternative route. A barrier blocks the way to the only alternate route, but Yasato tells them that their magic power could help if they were to travel to the bottom of Baroy Town. A monster named Blazing Kirrin held the key to deactivate the barrier. After defeating Blazing Kirrin, the party moved on to the surface, thanks to the deactivation of the barrier. They arrive in an Underground River, which they quickly traverse and arrive in an ancient factory. They encounter robotic warriors that seek to kill them. Shu realizes that they still think that the war is raging. They try to find a way back to the surface. When they do, they witness the entire ground beneath them erupt with robots from the factory. Each robot has a screen with Nene on it in place of a head. They use the special barrier activation device to create a barrier. the robots are unable to penetrate the barrier. Realizing the attempt is useless, Nene takes command of the citizens of Baroy Town and makes them attack the companions. Shocked when they see their friends destroying themselves, the party gets Jiro to shut off the barrier. They are then captured and taken to a prison. Shu awakens alone in his cell, with Hineto serving him food. Yasato arrives a short while after and frees Shu, explaining that Shu is his master too. Alone, Shu manages to free Jiro, Marumaro and Zola, but cannot find Kluke. After searching for a while, they see Kluke being removed from her cell on Nene's orders and witness Nene destroying Hineto. He begins threatening Yasato, which the party prevents him. Nene has his robotic servants attack the party while he flees in a giant machine made up of robots. Shu and his friends chase after Nene but fail in catching him. When Nene vanishes, they search in vain for a way to follow him and save Kluke. They eventually reach a town with a barrier around it called Pachess Town. Upon passing through the barrier, they learn from the residents that it is impossible to leave through the barrier and that it is Nene who put the barrier around the town. In an attempt to escape, Shu uses his Shadow to attack the barrier, but it does nothing to the obstacle. After witnessing this, the residents of the town become terrified and wary of the party, thinking that they are in league with Nene. The group head to the Elder's house and inform him of their affiliation to King Jibral via one of Zola's rings. The Elder ends the fear of the residents and the party sleep. They wake up seeing a light behind the Elder's house. They find the Elder manipulating machinery and looking at a mural of a terrible creature destroying the Ancient civilization. After listening to the Elder's tale, the party recovers a piece of machinery that lets them control the moon laser in the underground of Pachess. It is then used to successfully destroy the barrier that Nene erected. The Elder thanks them with a strange device and the party travel off in search of Kluke once more. After traveling a short way, the party witness Nene's fortress rise from a crater. Nene throws Kluke off the fortress, but Shu saves her. Nene than explains that the collar around Kluke's neck is a bomb with a 60-minute fuse. He promises to deactivate it if the party can reach him. With Kluke back in their ranks, the party race through Nene's fortress. Along the way, they encounter Szabo, whom Nene rebuilt following the encounter on the Flying Fortress. After defeating him and his lackeys, they finally encounter their friend, Yasato the robot. After freeing him from an imprisoning sweeper circuit, the party was ambushed by the wrecked Szabo. Zola tells them to save Kluke while she deals with the general. The remaining four travel upward on a lift to reach Nene in the nick of time. Nene laughs at the party and praises their progress. He then activates a choke function on Kluke's collar, prompting Shu, Jiro and Marumaro to try to pull it off. As they begin to succeed, Nene grants them collars of their own, which also choke them. Belatedly realizing that the collar was never meant to explode, the party also learn an amazing secret: the light orbs they swallowed were actually Nene's soul. The old man extracts the party's spheres and uses their accumulated growth to restore himself to his youth. He changes the party's Shadows into his own Chimaera Shadow and prepares to crush them using an ancient walker transport. The party, drained, falls unconscious. Shu suddenly wakes up. Although his light sphere was taken, he still has magic that isn't Nene's soul. He repels the walker and then teleports Jiro, Kluke and Marumaro away. He then flees along with them, promising to return, then Nene ponders how Shu retained his magic.Disk 3  He finds Jiro, Kluke and Marumaro, who are wondering about Zola, their escape, the collars around their necks and how to destroy the flesh-eating trees that prevent their escape from the village. Shu attempts to attack the monster tree, but without his Shadow, he is quickly knocked out. After reawakening in the same house where he originally woke, he ponders how to escape. He ventures out to look at the moon and meets an orphaned girl named Sahlia who is about to commit suicide as she no longer sees a purpose in life. Shu tries to stop her, but is unable to sway her mind. He triggers a strange knowledge in his head as Jiro arrives to witness an incredible event: the summoning of Shu's Shadow. Full of self-determination and fury, Shu summons his Shadow, which is far more powerful than the one Nene supplied him with. He is then confronted by his own dark side Dragon, which he easily defeats by unleashing the power of his heart. Traveling back, he finds Kluke ill and cures her. The remaining party members attempt to summon their own Shadow, to no avail. Shu then tries to defeat the tree, with the help of his friends. With Shu's Shadow, the tree is defeated and the party leaves. The party now travels to the world's polar regions, with Jiro, Kluke, and Marumaro trying constantly to regain their Shadows. Eventually, they arrive in the frozen Noluta Village, in this condition thanks to Nene. They try to free the frozen residents with a machine. It does not respond to Shu's magic, needing the power of more magic. After hearing the troubles of some of the residents, lights shine in the party's hearts. They all eventually summon their Shadows, defeating their dark sides and regaining their magic. Combining their magic, the group defeats Nene's mechat, and thaw the ice in Noluta. The grateful residents thank them and they travel through the mountains to make their way around. After a while, the party finds a group of large clear spires and Zola lands in a stolen mechat. With Zola back, they enter the mechat to find Nene. Their adversary actually entered the core of the planet and found a way to restore it to the modified version of the Ancients, with cube worlds at the center. he now makes an announcement to the world that he is the ruler. Zola pilots the party's mechat into the Cube World region. Landing on a cube with buildings, they find it reinhabited by the mechanical residents of Baroy Town. After resting, they visit a cube with ancient creatures populating it. After defeating a dinosaur, Nene challenges them to reach him. If they can, he will make them the rulers of the world for when he dies. Shu and his friends race through the cube, battling Nene's most elite minions and the cube's inhabitants. Nene bids his resurrected ally, General Szabo, to use his new parts to destroy the party. He confronts them, but has his new parts and weapons stripped. He is then badly crippled by Zola, who demands to be taken to Nene.Development  Blue Dragon was first revealed on February 24, 2005 as one of two unnamed role-playing games in development by Mistwalker Studios for the console which later came to be known as the Xbox 360. In an IGN interview following the unveiling, Peter Moore stressed the importance to Microsoft of having Japanese games available on the system, commenting \"... It's a main priority for me in the next 12-18 months to ensure Japanese developers are our partners.\" Contributors to Blue Dragon include a number of well known Japanese figures in the gaming industry. The title's original story was written by Hironobu Sakaguchi, the game director of the first five Final Fantasy video games. It also features art from Akira Toriyama, the creator of Dragon Ball and visual character and monster designer and illustrator of both the Dragon Quest series and Chrono Trigger. Much of the actual software development work on the game was done at Artoon, with Takuya Matsumoto serving as director and Manabu Kusonoki responsible for the game's worldview. Matsumoto previously worked as a designer on Blinx 2: Masters of Time and Space, while Kusonoki is known for his work at Sega, including the world of Panzer Dragoon. Near the end of November 2005, roughly a year before the title was released in Japan, Artoon's Naoto \u014cshima indicated that the game was around 40% complete. He also pointed out that Artoon had previously been known primarily for action titles, so that responsibility for Blue Dragon was originally somewhat frightening. Following this, a relative lack of media information for most of 2006 resulted in speculation that the title would be delayed until 2007, but Microsoft's Takashi Sensui confirmed in August 2006 that the game would indeed see a year-end 2006 release. In a November 2006 interview with IGN, Sakaguchi confirmed that the sequel, Blue Dragon 2, was in the planning stages, and would presumably start development shortly thereafter. Later in an issue of Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump, it was announced that Blue Dragon Plus is in the works for the Nintendo DS. This game will be a real-time simulation RPG and feature 2D sprite graphics.Audio  Blue Dragon's score was produced and composed by Nobuo Uematsu, who is famous for composing much of the music in the popular Final Fantasy series. One of the boss themes, \"Eternity\", was written by Sakaguchi, composed by Uematsu, and includes vocals by English singer Ian Gillan. Blue Dragon Original Soundtrack was released on December 13, 2006 and was arranged by Satoshi Henmi and Hiroyuki Nakayama. Music from Blue Dragon was performed live at the Play! A Video Game Symphony concerts in 2006.Manga and Anime  At first he is only able to use fire breath and a punch attack. But on episodes 11-12, he becomes able to materalize a sword made of something like energy. He is also able to use a new kind of blue firebreath which he calls his new finishing move fire crison . See also: Blue Dragon Ral\u03a9Grad, Blue Dragon ST, Blue Dragon (anime)Reception  Reviews for Blue Dragon have been somewhat mixed, although generally favorable. On the review aggregator Game Rankings, the game had an average score of 77% based on 64 reviews. While many of the reviewers praised the game for its traditional approach, a few reviewers criticized it for that very reason, with one reviewer remarking \"In fact, there is very little you can point to in Blue Dragon that hasn't been done multiple times over before\". The story also came under scrutiny from some reviewers for being too generic and too similar to existing Japanese RPGs, with slow pacing during the beginning of the game. Eurogamer noted that the apparent lack of effort put into the facial animations for each character resulted in a limited ability to express emotion. They also noted that the mouth movements are well timed, but that the rest of the characters' facial movements are \"static\". Game Informer commented that Blue Dragon lacked \"jaw dropping\" moments and was missing a nebulous \"key element\" to make it perfect. 1UP.com also picked up on this, adding that Blue Dragon was missing \"strong characters, gripping storytelling, and excellent pacing\". X-Play noted that the game was very visually pleasing but they said the game was like any other role-playing game. Though most of the reviewers criticized the title in one way or another, they also all complimented it for its excellent graphics and music. Game Informer also noted that \"the characters look like sculpted figurines wandering around a world built to scale\". GameSpy complimented the title's music and graphics saying the game had \"phenomenal music; and magnificently rendered cutscenes\".External links Jiro  Jiro (\u30b8\u30fc\u30ed Jiiro) is the deuteragonist and one of the main characters in the Blue Dragon universe. He was created by Hironobu Sakaguchi and drawn by Akira Toriyama.Overview Biography  In the game, he grew up with Shu and Kluke in Talta. He is easily claimed as the smart one in the group and is usually categorized as calm in nature. Rarely does this happen, but if in a stressful situation, he doesn't seem afraid to snap back at those who yell at him (Shu and Jiro during the event in Pachess Town). In the anime, both of his parents and his sister are dead. His village was burnt down when he was younger and he ran into Zola, where he learnt to summon his Shadow. Jiro has a hard time controlling his emotions in contrast to the game counterpart of himself. He's usually cold against the others, and the only one he seems to like is Zola. In the second season of the anime, he lives alone in the mountains and trains very hard to be stronger than shadow users. He often fights against Delphinium who has her shadow and tries to be better like her. When Shu arrives at his house in episode 6, he won't come with him and beats Shu in a fight. Later he is seen with Xi, the sister of the informant Homeron, returns his shadow and in the final battle against Rudolph and helped Shu and the others to defeat him. In the second season, he isn't seen as much as in the first season, like Kluke.Appearance  In the\u00a0video game, he has short, straight dark-brown hair and dark brown eyes. He has a normal complexion and a round face. Jiro wears white trousers, and a black turtleneck with a green tunic overtop - a belt around the abdomen. In the anime, he has dark-blue eyes, grey-brown longer hair and a pale complexion. Basically, he wears the same outfit as he does in the anime, only the shirt and pant colors are swapped. In Tenkai no Shichi Ryuu, he wears a white T-shirt, green coat-like overtop, and black pants. He has grown larger muscles and keeps his hood over his head most of the time.Blue Dragon Video Game  In the video game, he grew up in Talta Village along with his childhood friends Shu and Kluke. In contrast to the anime, his parents are still alive, but their status is unknown in Blue Dragon Plus and Blue Dragon Awakened Shadow. It is revealed that he has a crush on Kluke and usually competes against Shu for her affections. He assisted Shu in defeating Nene along with Kluke, Marumaro, and Zola in the first game. In Blue Dragon Plus, he was again a playable character and was the healer of the group (along with Himiko). His role isn't as huge as it was in the first game. In Blue Dragon Awakened Shadow, he is challenged by Shu to an herb-gathering contest; the winner getting a date with Kluke (he reluctantly agrees to this).Blue Dragon Anime  In the anime, he grew up in the village of Mafe, which was burnt down by Grand Kingdom. Jiro lost his parents and sister in the burning of the village and throughout the first season (until episode 32), was bent on killing Nene for revenge. He's usually cruel to the others (particularly Shu) but cooperates when necessary. He first met Zola after retreating from his destroyed village. Shown off-screen, Jiro was able to summon his Shadow, Minotaur.Blue Dragon Trails of the Seven Shadows  In the second season, Jiro continues to search for a new answer after losing Minotauros in the final battle. Since then, he trained vigorously for 2 years as a swordsman with his goal to defeat Delphinium in combat. Despite being unable to defeat her, Jiro proved himself remarkably as being able to best Shu and Blue Dragon in combat to hone his resolve. Since then, Jiro is the last of the Light warrior descendants to recover his shadow as he traveled independently while being an ally to Shu's party. After infiltrating the White Guardians' fortress, Jiro was rescued by Xi and the two cooperated since then while gathering info. In episode 39, Jiro regained his ability to summon Minotaur from Hildegard. Jiro joins Shu and the others in the final battle against Rudolph.Shadow  Jiro's Shadow is the Minotaur, from Greek mythology. Minotaur is (like all Shadows) blue in the game with frail arms and red eyes. In his Corporeal form, his physical appearance strengthens and he's able to summon lightning from the sky to attack enemies. In the anime, Minotaur seems to be more muscular and experiences in physical attacks such as punching. Unlike the game, his complexion is a tone of bluish-green and he has yellow eyes rather red. He is usually categorized as the wise-guy, always cracking jokes at the enemy or throwing in sarcastic comments against his enemies (Cynthia). Though sarcastic, Minotaur is serious when needs to be and usually chides Jiro for using too much energy in battle.Personality  In the game, he's categorized as calm and the \"smart-guy\" of the group. Temperate in nature, he tends to analyze situations before jumping into action like the brash Shu. Though not hinted at much in the first game, he seems to be experienced with technology and (first game only) seems to have an interest in reading/books. He has a crush on Kluke. In the anime, Jiro acts completely different and tends to let emotions get the best of him (until episode 31). He is unusually cold towards Shu and (usually) his other teammates besides Zola. After episode 31, he doesn't seem as cruel towards others, but still lacks trust towards other people. At the start of the anime, he believed power was the only way to prevail over enemies. When he was young his parents died, so he promised to himself that he will be stronger than he is that time. In Tenkai No Schichi Ryuu he's usually seen frowning and keeps to himself. He has improved his fighting skills without his shadow. Jiro also has a rivalry with Delphinium (it was also revealed by Delphinium that she and Jiro have\u00a0fought many times).Relationships Shu  In the first Blue Dragon game, the two are very close friends. In fact, they even planned to take down the Land Shark by building a net made of metals from the Ancient Ruins. Even though there was absolutely no reference to a school whatsoever, it is stated that Jiro is Shu's classmate. It could be easily said that Shu used to drag Jiro around in \"forbidden\" areas (Ancient Ruins) and not so much Kluke; thus showing their friendship. As the game progresses, the two start to drift apart due to the adventure and their harnessed feelings for their crush: Kluke. By the end of the first game, the two ask her who she likes better: Jiro or Shu. In Blue Dragon Plus, Jiro seems to have some hostile feelings towards Shu, which may be because of the KlukexShuxSahlia love triangle. In other words, it is possibly Jiro is jealous that Kluke was fighting against Sahlia for Shu's affections; meaning jealousy got the best of him in Plus. In Awakened Shadow, it is said by a Neo Jibral resident that the two are as close as brothers, but rivals. Their relationship in Plus and Awakened Shadow vaguely puts reference to their anime relationship. In the anime, the two are undoubtfully rivals. Jiro usually picks on Shu and calls him insulting names such as \"idiot\" and occasionally swears at him (uncut and subbed). By episode 31, Shu and Jiro seem to ease up on the rivalry and become a bit friendlier towards one another. In Tenkai no Shichi Ryuu, Jiro challenges Shu to a fight to prove how strong he's grown over the two years. Every once and a while, he and Xi help Shu and the others infiltrate White Brigade. He assists Shu in the final battleKluke  In the game, she was one of Jiro's childhood friends (the other being Shu). He has a crush on her, but due to analyzing every move, he hasn't told her anything. Jiro at one point in the first game told her it was okay to cry if others were around (see Kluke for more info.). In Blue Dragon Plus, Jiro's crush on Kluke is barely noticeable and the only noticeable hint towards any romance would be the Star and Moon spells. In Awakened Shadow however, his crush on Kluke returns as there is a quest called \"Jiro in Love\" where he competes against Shu for a date with Kluke. In the anime, he is a bit cruel towards her, but not as much as he is to the others. Jiro is usually comforted by Kluke whenever there's an issue going on. On a side note, he also seems to assist her in certain activities such as decoding the Extra Seven and repairing the Mechat. At the beginning of the anime, he didn't want Kluke to come along due to the fact she (at that point) didn't have the ability to fight/summon a Shadow.Marumaro  Their relationship in the game is a bit unknown as they do not interact much. In the first season of the anime, he is usually paired up with Marumaro to fight in battle. He also doesn't like it when Marumaro gets perverted.Zola  Their relationship in the game is a bit unknown as they do not interact much. However, Jiro does comment on Zola's skills in the first game. In Awakened Shadow, both he and Zola work together to assist King Jibral. In the anime, Jiro ran into Zola after the burning of his village. Since then, Jiro considers Zola as his personal mentor for the strength he pursues.Reception  Jiro has a somewhat minorly-positive reception. He is praised mostly for being a guy that is a healer, a rare ability to have in RPG games. Though he is often mocked for having \"Hitler-hair\" due to the identical hair-styles. He is also poked at for having an extremely identical outfit to the Great Saiyanman, a well-known character from Dragon Ball. Others usually hate him because he doesn't seem as powerful as Shu. His reputation seemed to get more negatives than positives because his personality was altered to fit a stereotypical \"rival\" for the main hero in the anime. Overall, Jiro doesn't have such a bad reception. He is commonly called \"cute\" among fans (more so the anime rather the game due to Tenkai no Shichi Ryuu). Most fans like his personality of the game rather the anime, but believe that the anime version of Jiro could survive a longer fight.Friends/Allies Enemies/Rivals Quotes  \"Tears can ease your sorrow.

He does this by establishing Gran Kingdom. Deathroy tends to ride on his left shoulder.Biography Shadow  Nene's Shadow is Chimera. In the video game, it was originally a red counterpart of Blue Dragon. After absorbing the Light Sphere's of Shu, Kluke, Jiro, and Marumaro, it ends up becoming a Chimera.Video Game  Nene runs Grand Kingdom and flies across the globe causing destruction and despair in a mobile air fortress surrounded by purple clouds. His main goal is world domination. Nene can fight without his shadow and suspend himself into the air, avoid energy blasts, and absorb others' shadow powers to increase his strength tenfold. His mastery over his magic was so great that it caused an illness that led to him rapidly aging. To deal with this problem, he manipulated events that Shu, Jiro, Kluke, and Marumaro would each take a light sphere and learning to use magic so he could eventuall take their power and develop a stronger soul to cure his illness. He eventually succeeds in this plan, but they manage to retain their power. When eventually faced at the end of the game, he offers them a chance to join, specifically offering Shu a chance to be his successor. When Shu turns his offer down, Nene attempts to take their power again, but finds that their power had matured and become their own, so he couldn't take it. He is fought and defeated, and after which is killed by Zola. His shadow, Chimera is a phenomenally strong shadow and puts up a fight agains Zola and the others. Nene also carries the power to make his shadow multiply. He has the power to contol up to seven Chimeras at once.Anime  Nene has been capturing children to power his artificial shadow machine. He was the one who gave General Logi some artificial Shadow Wielders to form his Independent Flying Squadron. He overwhelmed Shu and Co. at first until Kluke manifested her Phoenix shadow and got them out of there as Nene's air fortress (referred to as the Galleon) took off. Nene had used his Galleon to rip out cities from the ground. When it came to the Hippopotamus ruins, he ended up fighting Shu, Jiro, Kluke, Marumaro, and Zola while Bouquet was completing her testing. Nene retreated to the Galleon to drop the Hippopotamus Ruins on Coreed. Luckily, Bouquet managed to complete her test and the Ruins were redirected away from Coreed. It is later revealed by Zola that he is a descendant of one of the Soldiers of Light. As Nene unleashed his Black Shadow army upon Coreed, Shu and Co. rode Griff birds to it while Conrad and his army fight the Black Shadowarmy. By the next encounter on board the Galleon, Shu and the others fought Nene again. During battle, Nene merged with his shadow and Deathroy. He was finally destroyed by Shu and Blue Dragon with the attack powerful enough to cause Nene's Galleon to crash to the ground. With Nene destroyed, most of Gran Kingdom's forces were reported to either be fleeing or even deserting.Abilities Andropov  Zergei Andropov (\u30bb\u30eb\u30b2\u30a4\u30fb\u30a2\u30f3\u30c9\u30ed\u30dd\u30d5 ) or Sarre (in the english dub) is an anime-excluive character from the Blue Dragon (anime). and a member of General Logi's Independent Flying Squadron. He is the youngest member of General Logi's Mobile Unit serve as reconnaissance, thus being the most intelligent of the group.Overview Biography  Andropov first appeared where he used his shadow to oversee the fights between Zola's group and the Independent Flying Squadron members. When he was encountered by Shu, he left when General Logi came into view. As the fight progressed, he continued to survey the battle until General Logi ordered a retreat. Following an orchestrated prison break at a Gran Kingdom prison near Castle Des La Testa, he gives the coordinates to Gilliam to head there. When Cynthia and Zola's group ended up in Death Valley, she contacted Andropov to locate her and find her a way out. When Zola came up with a plan to raid General Logi's ship to reclaim the Extra Seven, Andropov was among the Independent Flying Squad members given a Power Booster. He, Lemaire, and Schneider served as the second defense (and provide additional help) should Zola's group manages to defeat the first defense consisting of Cynthia, Gilliam, Todd, and Bishop. While Lemaire was fighting Zola, he and Schneider fought Jiro and Marumaro. Andropov and Schneider combined their moves to defeat Marumaro. Just then, Zola arrived to help Jiro. When Shu's Blue Dragon started to unleash a lot of power, he and Andropov managed to get General Logi out of there at the last minute. Following Nene's destruction, General Logi announced his group's secession from Gran Kingdom and had Andropov attack some Gran Kingdom fleets. He then had Andropov and Schneider train hard for their next mission. After doing a reconnaissance on Zola's group, Andropov reported to General Logi (after he had established the Rosekstan kingdom) that Zola is leading them to the Sealed Grounds. When ordered to capture one of Zola's fellow Shadow Wielders, Andropov was successful at capturing Kluke. He also happened to be the one to let Kluke free when she was captured. Near the end of the first series, he starts to develop a crush on Kluke (even though he never told her at that time) after he used his shadow's ability to capture her for General Logi to interrogate. When it came to the battle\u00a0against Zola, he and Schneider fight two giant shadow monsters. Andropov fell unconscious as Schneider sacrifices his life to destroy them.Trial of the Seven Shadows  Two years later, Andropov was recuperating\u00a0under Kluke's care. Shu had arrived to look for Kluke only for Andropov to tell him that Kluke does not want to fight. He was also informed on what happened to General Logi at the time. When a Rosekstan airship appears in the village they are living in, Andropov defends Kluke the best he could until Shu and the Bouquet/Blue Dragon repel it. He and Kluke join up with Shu to help Rosekstan fight the White Brigade. Andropov later helps out in the fight against Rudolph.Appearence  Andropov has light blue jagged hair that sticks upwards (a constant joke would say it's similar to a Super Saiyan's hairstyle), slanted-rectangular sky blue eyes and a light tan complexion. In season 1, he wears a blue jacket with the Grand Kingdom symbol on his right shoulder, a white scarf, white pants and dark blue (purple) boots. He, like every other Flying Squadron Member, wears a 'scouter' to communicate with other members on his team. In the second season, he appears in patient's clothing from his severed injuries during the Darkness battle. It consists of a long-sleeved blue shirt with a small white-trimmed v-neck collar, and matching pants with white trim around the ankles. During his recovery, he's usually seen with a brown cane used to lean against for support.Shadow  Andropov's shadow is an artificial shadow named Alubujem, a four-armed crystalline creature who helps Andropov with his reconnaissance by launching out the crystals required for it. Alubujem can also launch an endless stream of crystal shards for rapid attacks. Its most unique ability is reassimilation into whatever shape if shattered and its pieces can be manipulated by Andropov. It can emit mid-range two crystal sword and can elongate it like hands to inflict piercing damage. Its body crystals are its projectile weapons, which can also monitor and project images at any distance for reconnaissance. Attacks:Relationships Shu  The two first met when Andropov ambushed Shu and prevented him from getting closer to Kluke and Marumaro. From there, Andropov was ordered to leave by Rogi, who showed up not so late afterwards. The two have fought in battle more than once during the first season, but their relationship (besides being enemies for the first half) is unknown. In season 2, they still seem to have a bitter relationship, which is most likely caused by Kluke for Shu is /jealous/ of his, Andropov, and Kluke's relationship. Not to mention the dour fact that he's one of the reasons why Kluke didn't want to join the resistance. The two get in a fist fight while Kluke is sleeping (due to using up so much power) and are broken up by Bouquet. From there, they go seperate ways (Shu pouts outside while Andropov pouts on the balcony). They fight seperately during the final battle against Rudolph; the only sign showing that he is an ally with Shu being defeating the dragons that appear.Jiro  In season 1, they've fought on more than one occassion in battle. Their relationship is unknown in season 1 and season 2 seeing how they rarely interact. However, when fighting in the final battle in Tenkai, their combined attack seems to work pretty well against enemies. When Jiro showed up in the end, Andropov seemed surprised, but other than that, no words were exchanged.Kluke  In season 1, he at first had no affections for Kluke. However, later in the season, he's currently using his Shadow's power to spy on the group of five and happens to see Kluke (in of the crystals) coming his way. Hiding behind a tree, Andropov looks around to see Kluke, who is knealt down in a field of flowers in the middle of the forest. He seems to grow a \"minor\" affection towards her, but is snapped out of his thoughts when Schneider calls. Later in that episode, he, Schenider, and Logi ambush the group and, under a command by their leader, Logi, are ordered to capture one of the group members. Schneider comments on \"which one shall it be?\", a somewhat sarcastic comment, but instead of receiving a verbal reply, Andropov charges over to Kluke and has Alubujem seal her in a crystal prison. She's knocked out and taken onboard their ship and from there, the remaining Squadron members leave. Andropov, who's currently assigned to guarding Kluke, exchanges a few /shy/ words to her as he has already developed feelings for the other. Without her knowing, Andropov later helps her escape by leaving the key to her bracelet on a desk when they arrive at the Sealed Grounds. Kluke later thanks him for letting her go, but he flushes and stubbornly replies that he \"accidentally forgot it there.\" After a few scenarios, Logi and Shu's group join forces and head out to seal the darkness. They come across a tough obstacle where Schneider tells the Warriors of Light to go while he and Andropov stay behind and fight the guards. Kluke is worried, but Andropov tells her to trust/believe in him and that they'd make it out in one piece. A reluctant Kluke leaves with the other group and pushes Shu onwards when the latter says they should go back \"because Logi knows something happened.\" She tells her friend that she believes in Andropov and that going back would only show her lack of trust. From that point on, Kluke is unaware of what happened to Andropov. In Tenkai no shichi Ryuu, Kluke works as a doctor and when one of the injured patients is rolled into the room on a cot, she recognizes Andropov and cries, glad to see that he's alright. During a flashback when Shu comes to invite Kluke to the resistance, she refuses him as she explains that she doesn't have a shadow anymore. Shu tries to convince Kluke but she refuses him in the end. From there the two reside in a village located in the mountains (which is speculated to be Andropov's hometown based on how he described it to her); she takes care of Andropov and looks after the village's children who have lost their parents. When Shu visits their house to try and invite Kluke once more, Andropov was the one to talk to him and strongly refuses him as of her previous answer to him. Later in the series, their house is destroyed and was aided by Shu and the others in the nick of time when they were attacked. Kluke regains her shadow here and decided to join Shu with the war. Andropov hesitatingly joins as well, telling Shu that \"I will follow her will\". With that, they're forced to seek shelter elsewhere. Seeing how Kluke and Andropov rarely appear in season 2, not much is known about their well-being.Marumaro  Not much is known about their relationship for they don't interact much. However, Marumaro does get a mischevious side towards the end of season 1, saying to Andropov (after noticing the latter's blush at Kluke's words) \"I think we could put aside our differences for the better good.\" Possibly implying that he wanted to get the part as \"match-maker.\" In Tenkai no Shichi Ryuu, they don't interact, but Andropov does come to Marumaro's rescue when he's losing a fight against the dragons attacking the village in the mountains.Zola  His relationship with Zola is unknown, but its possible he has some hostile feelings towards her for she summoned the darkness that nearly destroyed the world and killed Schneider.Bouquet  They rarely interact in season 1 but her and Marumaro do hold him back from attacking Zola (a little comical scene as Marumaro has him around the head and Bouquet the waist) In season 2 Bouquet breaks up his and Shu's fight and later talks to him about Kluke. She also pulls Andropov and Marumaro away from Shu and Kluke so the two can have some time alone. Bouquet hits him on the head with an \"unknown metal object\" (possibly a frying pan) when Andropov grows jealous of Shu and Kluke's interaction.Schneider  Schneider was first ordered by General Logi to look after Andropov. At first, he did it only out of orders, but he grew closer to Andropov and it no longer became a \"job\". Andropov usually goes to Schneider when an issue arrives (ex: when he asks what will happen to Kluke once they reached the Sealed Grounds) Schneider later admits to Andropov before he dies that he thought he was going to be the one looking out after Andropov not the other way around.Logi  Logi is Andropov's superior while also a father figure. In Tenkai no Shichi Ryuu, he didn't know Andropov was alive until he, Andropov, and Kluke went with Shu and the others to confront Logi. When Andropov was given a chance to talk to Logi, Logi asks Andropov where he has been and why he didn't come to him sooner. He also mentions that he has tried searching for them after the fight with the darkness. This proves that the general shows much concern towards the young boy, as he is the only survivor left of his Flying Squadron. After some exchanges, Logi asks Andropov of what he is going to do next. Andropov says, \"I'm not a warrior anymore. Furthermore, I found something more important than fighting\". With that, Logi dismisses Andropov and has been relieved of his duties in Rose Cross Army. In the final battle, Andropov expressed concern when Logi was attacked by one of the dragon's \"beams\" and no sooner was his Shadow smacked by an assaulting opponent.Trivia Noi  Noi (\u30ce\u30a4 Noi) is a new major character in the\u00a0Blue Dragon universe and the deuteragonist in Blue Dragon: Trials of the Seven Shadows. Appeared first as a mysterious character, it is eventually revealed as one of the Investiture Beings who chose to assist humanity by joining Shu and co..Biography  Noi has the distinction of being the first character viewers see in Trials of the Seven Dragons as he shown being chased by Mikhail. Despite being an Investiture Being, he has chosen to depart from the group and instead help Shu achieve his goals of defending Earth from destruction. It is shown he truly cared for the human world and humans. He didn't like the boredom up in the Castle Azure and decided to come to Earth and was made a traitor of the Legion of Elite Species. He last learned more about the human ways and thus, truly awoken himself, much earlier than expected. He is very good friends with Shu and the others after opening up about his true identity and is currently the new leader of the Legion of Elite Species as he knew most about humans out of the remaining members of the Legion of Elite Species, including himself, Rottarace, and Hildegard. At first, has shown himself to be very arrogant, rude (referring to Bouquet as 'busty'), and demanding. During their early friendship, Shu had referred to Noi as 'annoying'. He was also very secretive refusing to tell his compatriots anything about himself and much more about the situation than he felt needed to. Eventually, he does open up to the group and found himself as a part of their group. He found himself with a deep connection with everyone of the group and as said before, later awoken his true form at a very early state. He is also very wise and comes up with most of the strategies and giving advice to Shu and the others.Personality  Noi is extremely childish and immature, but also extremely intelligent and observant. He hates being called a child and will often get angry when anyone refers to him as such. He is also extremely stubborn, selfish and bossy at the beginning of the series, often only agreeing to aid the other characters in battle if the bribe him with sweets. Despite this, Noi later grows to truly care for his friends and becomes fiercely loyal to them. Despite leaving his kin, at the start of the second season, Noi initially continues to follow all of their rules, but later breaks off his connection with the Legion entirely in favor of his friendship with Shu and the others.Biography  Noi was the youngest member of the Investiture Beings, thus not allowed to leave Castle Azure. During his first trip to Earth, Shu catches Noi's attention and, though they never meet in person, Noi comes to respect Shu's positive attitude, loyalty, and determination. This causes him to take a more positive view of humanity than the rest of the Dragons. Eventually, before the events of the first season (shown in the last season epilogue), Noi learned of Rudolph's true intentions for humanity and fleed their lair st the start of the second season. He is pursued by Michael, who causes him to crash land on Earth, where he comes face-to-face with Shu and Bouquet. When Michael attacks them, Noi awakens Shu's shadow to help him fight him off. After Michael leaves, Noi awakens Bouquet's shadow and the three of them set off on a quest to awaken the shadows of Marumaro, Jiro, and Kluke. Throughout their journey, Shu and Bouquet try, without any success, to get Noi to reveal more about himself them. Despite having left the Legion, Noi continues to abide by their rules and does not reveal anything to anybody on Earth. When the trio encounters Michael again, Noi grants Bouquet the power to merge which allows, them to drive him off again. Upon the trio reaching Lago Village, a misunderstanding causes Noi and Marumaro to form a rivalry. Because of this Noi initially refuses to awaken Marumaro's shadow. The two participate in a series of contests, which Marumaro continues to win, however Noi wins the last challenge and ultimately awakens Marumaro's shadow, after which he joins them on their adventure. When the group tracks down Jiro, Noi reluctantly awakens Deathroy's shadow on Shu's orders when Bouquet is held hostage by Delphinium. When the group tracks down Kluke and Shu goes off with the intention of talking to her by himself, Noi ends up finding Kluke and having her mistake him for one of the children in the village. The two talk, after which Noi awakens her shadow, telling her that he gave her a special magic that would protect her when she needs it. After that, Noi leaves Kluke and returns to the group. Later on, after spotting Bouquet with Lotarus, Noi immediately rushes to warn Shu that Bouquet is in danger. During the battle with Michael, when it becomes apparent that Shu, Bouquet, and Marumaro are unable to win, Noi finally breaks off all ties with the Legion by breaking their rules and merging with Shu. This fusion grants Shu enough power to hold his own against Michael and manage to injure him. After Michael is driven off by the White Guardian's attacks, Noi finally reveals his connection to the Legion to his friends, who are okay with it.  When the group investigates the underground ruins with Conrad, Griz, and Daner, Noi's identity as a member of the legion becomes extremely useful, as he is the only one who can understand the various files on the computer in the ruins. This, along with some help from Lota, allows Noi to identify Zmey as a place that contains similar ruins, and would likely have something that would be helpful for the war against the Legion. In order to help prevent Rudolph from gaining an excuse to destroy humanity, Noi helps the others in trying to stop the war between Rosekstan and the White Guardians. Following Vermillion's death at Rudolph's hand, Noi goes to Zmey ahead of the rest of the group and joins up with Conrad, Griz, Daner, and Legolas. Together, the five of them discover the mass driver, which could be used to transport people to the Legion's lair. During the battle of Zmey, Noi fights alongside his friends and is chosen, along with Shu, Bouquet, Marumaro, Primella, and Dr. Tarkovsky, as one of the individuals to travel to the Legion's lair and confront Rudolph. Before they arrive at the Legion's base, Noi grants Shu the ability to fuse with his own shadow. During the final battle with Rudolph, Noi fights directly alongside Shu and plays a large role in the battle. When Rudolph knocks Shu out for the first time, Noi takes over fighting Rudolph one on one. During this fight, Noi's determination causes his dragon form to mature, however he is still nowhere near strong enough to match Rudolph. Following Rudolph's defeat, Noi catches Shu and prevents him from falling to his death. After the battle's end, Lotarus and Hildegard name Noi the new council chairman for his trust and understanding of humanity and the three leave.Abilities  As the youngest Investiture Being, Noi doesn't have as much power as the rest, but balanced by his smart intellect and tactics to support others. His most unique ability is his merging with other shadows to enhance their power, which he shares with Bouquet. With Shu being his main merging partner, Noi's fusion with Blue Dragon boosted him powerful enough to be on toe with Mikhail, enough to inflict a minor. Like the rest of the Dragons, he can reawaken shadows their wielders lost. His true form is that of a baby gray dragon with limited powers, albeit he is capable of taking on humans and machines.Dragon Form  Noi's True Form is a dark grey dragon in which he mainly transforms instead of a shadow wielder form. His shadow form was not shown but he looks like a baby dragon in his true form and enchants a spell to transform. He was way smaller than his fellow members having a small horn on his head, but larger than humans and not strong enough to battle powerful foes, though he could take on humans and machines. During the final battle with Rudolph, Noi's determination and desperation to assist eventually awakened and matured his dragon form. His form grew much larger becoming more suited for battle, growing three long horns on his head and spike-like horns from neck to tail. He can fire blue flame from his mouth and can create powerful gusts of wind by flapping his wings.Relationships Shu  Noi acted extremely rude and disrespectful toward Shu upon their first meeting. However it was all an act, as he greatly respected Shu and his boundless living for a long time, and this respect drove him to side with humanity against Rudolph. Noi and Shu eventually become close friends as the series progresses.Marumaro  When Noi and Marumaro first met, a misunderstanding caused them to form a fierce rivalry with each other. However, the two later make amends and become close friends.Kluke  During Noi's first meeting with Kluke, he seems to treat her with much more respect than he did with any other character. It's possible that this is because of the kind nature Kluke showed him, and the fact that she did not immediately look down on him for his childish appearance. Whatever the reason, Noi seemed to show legitimate concern for Kluke's well being.Trivia General Logi  General Logi is an anime-exclusive character in the Blue Dragon universe. He initially portrays as a villain in the first season but later revealed to be a descendant of the Seven Soldiers of Light, and becomes more supportive to Shu's party in the second season.Appearance  His regular appearance consists of long blond hair and grey/brown eyes, with a scar around his left eye caused by Zola. He wears a general's uniform with a black long-sleeved shirt with a golden top overcoat and a dark turquoise cape. On the right chest of his overcoat is the embedded Gran Kingdom symbol showing his affiliation. After Nene's defeat and Rosekstan's establishment, the red part of the symbol is inverted into yellow.Biography  General Logi is one of Gran Kingdom's elite generals and has known Zola for quite some time. He was the leader of her team when she joined the Gran Kingdom Army. It was during this time that he gained a scar on his left eye from her when she wasn't listening during one battle.Powers and Abilities  General Logi was the most powerful enemy face by Shu and his friends before Nene. His prowess and skills in battle were revered as legendary, making his reputation admirable to all who opposed Gran Kingdom. Logi still remained a primary adversary of the heroes, as any battle between them has yet reached a conclusion, even after Nene's defeat.Blue Dragon (anime)  During General Logi's first encounter with Shu and the others, he easily defeated them when he gained an artificial shadow named Valkyrie, and his power left the normally hot-headed Shu shaking in fear. General Logi is given some artificial shadow wielders from Nene to form his Independent Flying Squadron (consisting of Gilliam, Lemaire, Cynthia, Andropov, and Schneider). In his first encounter with Shu, his Valkyrie and Shu's Blue Dragon were equal in power. Blue Dragon managed to wound Valkyrie. When Zola appeared and told Shu to fall back, General Logi told his Independent Flying Squadron to retreat. It is later revealed that he had Gran Kingdom's Secret Intelligence Agent Delphinium orchestrated the theft of the Extra Seven so that his scientists can research them. Upon learning this, Zola leads her group to where General Logi's airship was last sighted. To prevent the Extra Seven from being reclaimed, he had Power Boosters made to enhance the powers of the Independent Flying Squadron's shadows. He assigned Gilliam, Todd, Bishop, and Cynthia to be the first defense while Lemaire, Andropov, and Schneider are to be the second defense. With Gilliam, Todd, Bishop, and Cynthia defeated and the other Independent Flying Squadron members occupied, General Logi fought Shu again with Kluke helping out while Bouquet infiltrated the airship. After Kluke tires herself out, Shu's Blue Dragon manages to cut off Valkyrie's left wing. When General Logi ends up doing a powerful attack on Shu, he managed to knock him down. Shu manages to go into overload endangering the area around him and managing to wound General Logi. Andropov and Schneider managed to get General Logi out of there at the last minute and retreat. In a status report when visiting Nene in his Galleon, General Logi mentions that he lost Lemaire and Cynthia in battle. Nene instructs General Logi to take a break while General Szabo advises Nene to have General Logi step down as leader of the Independent Flying Squadron. General Logi's scientists discover a strange temple somewhere in the north and inform him. General Logi tells Andropov and Schneider to watch over things while he's away. When it came to the battle against Nene's forces at Coreed, General Logi waited for the right moment to summon Arceus. After Nene's destruction, General Logi announced his group's secession from Gran Kingdom by having Schneider take over Castle Des la Teste and by having Andropov attack Gran Kingdom fleets. Upon being informed by Delphinium that some of Gran Kingdom's soldiers are either fleeing or even deserting, General Logi tells them that they are leaving Gran Kingdom. Later that night, General Logi is attacked by Delphinium who was displeased that General Logi is abandoning Gran Kingdom. When Andropov and Schneider arrive, Delphinium escapes while General Logi tells them not to go after her. The next day, he oversees Andropov and Schneider's training for what he has planned next. General Logi then establishes Rosenkreuz (an offshoot of Gran Kingdom that serves as a Shadow Extremist nation) in a Gran Kingdom-occupied town and persuades the civilians and Gran Kingdom army remnants there at the time to join his cause. He fights Zola again which ends with Kluke being kidnapped. He ends up interrogating her about what Zola is up to. In the next encounter, his true shadow is revealed and Zola was rescued by Kluke. It is later revealed that General Logi is one of the descendants of one of the Warriors of Light when Odin's statue emerges from the Sealed Grounds. When Zola goes rogue, he, Delphinium, and Deathroy help to fight her.Blue Dragon: Trial of the 7 Shadows  Two years later, General Logi is still in power and leading the Rosekstan forces across the four corners fo the continent, bent into establishing a new world order. He has his shadow reawakened by Lotarus when she arrives in Rosenkreuz' capital. After a fierce fight, Lotarus sets General Logi's castle on fire as General Logi is rescued by Matilda. General Logi hid out in the remains of Nene's fortress when he planned to stop the plots of the White Guardians. As his new dreadnought fortress Hraesvelg takes flight, he manages to fend off Furioso and the White Guardians soldiers with him.Trivia Marumaro  'Marumaro' (\u30de\u30eb\u30de\u30ed marumaro) is a character in the Blue Dragon video game and the Blue Dragon anime and metaseries created by Hironobu Sakaguchi and characters drawn by Akira Toriyama. Marumaro is one of the main characters in the Blue Dragon universe. In the game, he is voiced by Nika Futterman and Etsuko Kozakura. In the anime, he is voiced by R. Martin Klein and Sakiko Uran.Overview  Marumaro is a character from the Devee Clan, a race of creatures that wear pots for hats. He has a tendency to say \"Maro\" at the end of every sentence, except from in the game, where he says Maro instead of I or Me.In The Game  In the game, he is very loud and childish, very prone to dancing and often makes the other characters close their ears because of his loud voice. He first appears looking for a secret ancient medicine for his tribe, as they were all infected with a disease inflicted on them by Nene. He then joins up with Shu, Kluke, and Jiro and takes them to his home in Lago Village. When on the path to Jibral, he develops a crush on Zola when she, the King of Jibral, and his troops save the caravan they were in from Steel-Eating Tigers.Blue Dragon (anime)  In the anime, Marumaro is obsessed with girls (he also acts like a pervert in the original version) and his actions often end up angering Kluke and Bouquet. Most of this he inherited from his father.  He first appears when the village he was staying at was attacked by a Gran Kingdom fleet led by Ivanov and Gustav. When Shu, Jiro, Kluke, and Zola appear in the village and try to view what had happened from the memories of a damaged Mecha Robo, Marumaro attacked with his shadow, Saber Tiger. When it came to Kluke, he ended up pinching her boobs and commenting that she doesn't have much. When Kluke lunges herself toward him, he jumps and lifts her skirt grossing out Shu and Jiro. Marumaro comments about Kluke's white panties and asks if she has any better ones. Kluke ends up throwng rocks at Marumaro which he dodges before being grabbed by Killer Bat. Upon breaking free, Marumaro made off with their stuff. In order to bait Marumaro, they ended up using Kluke's panties which actually work as Zola and Killer Bat grab him. Still blaming them for destroying the city, Marumaro is told that they weren't the ones responsible. When Marumaro does find the ones responsible, he attacks. Things weren't looking good for Marumaro when Ivanov and Gustav were too much for him and Saber Tiger. The others catch up and Jiro and Zola unleash their shadows. Ivanov and Gustav withdraw from the fight when they got the captive villagers on board. He joins up with Shu and company while also managing to lift Kluke's skirt again. During the course of the adventure, he and Saber Tiger gain a rival in speed power in Gilliam of the Independent Flying Squadron. They clashed many times. On one occasion, Marumaro got separated from the others outside of Coreed and ended up using Saber Tiger to get him around when he got exhausted. They managed to find an inn and Marumaro was allowed to stay there for the night by it's innkeeper (who unbeknownst to Marumaro was a Shadow Wielder in Gran Kingdom's army who deserted Gran Kingdom). After being given a shower by Saber Tiger, Marumaro is attracted to the smell of the kitchen and runs out of the room with Saber Tiger running after him to re-towel him (his towel fell off when he ran out of the room). They end up outside of the kitchen where they peek at a pink-haired girl preparing a meal and Saber Tiger suspecting her to the wife of the innkeeper (in truth, she was his shadow). Saber Tiger pulled him away before he can do anything to her and told him to get dressed. When dinner was served, the innkeeper secretly put poison in the food and waited for Marumaro to collapse. When it happened, he and his shadow emerged only to be caught by surprise by Marumaro and Saber Tiger after flashing back to their desertion. After stating that his nose detected the poison, Marumaro and Saber Tiger told the innkeeper and his shadow that they aren't from Gran Kingdom. When a Gran Kingdom captain and his troops arrived at the inn, Marumaro posed as the chef when the Gran Kingdom Captain saw the food. At the point where the innkeeper's shadow blew the innkeeper's cover (she didn't like how the Wanted posters depicted her), Marumaro and Saber Tiger had to defend them and were able to send the Gran Kingdom Captain and his troops running. Marumaro and Saber Tiger reunited with Shu and the others and Marumaro ended up jumping onto Bouquet's boobs. When Marumaro and Saber Tiger wanted to get stronger by following the clues on his part of the Extra Seven, they decide to return to Lago Village. When it came to the instructions on the Extra Seven, they end up trying various things ranging from dropping the Devees' guardian statues onto the other Devees and Marumaro going on a panty-viewing activity in a nearby village. Zola managed to figure it out and had the others drive Marumaro and Saber Tiger to the ruins. Here they go through various obstacles which they complete, gaining a new power for Saber Tiger.Blue Dragon: Tenkai no shichi ryu  Two years later, Marumaro is back in his village until Noi reawakens his shadow. Upon joining up with Shu and Bouquet, Marumaro develops a rivalry with Noi. He also doesn't act perverted with Kluke anymore, and usually is only now perverted towards Bouquet or other girls.Quotes:  \"You...You...You so cool! It's loooooove!\" - Marumaro when he first sees Zola defeat the Steel-Eating Tigers \"Maro will call you Lady Zola!\" - Marumaro's new name for Zola \"The Devee Dance of Love!\" - After getting kissed on the cheek by Zola \"Thank you Kluke! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!\" - When Marumaro thanked Kluke for knowing the right medicine \"It's no good! Maro can't fight Lady Zola!\" - After the short battle against Zola ends \"But she sure has big boobs, maro!\" - Marumaro complimenting Bouquet in the Japanese version of Blue Dragon anime \"Huh? Hey Shu are you okay?\" - Marumaro after running over Shu in the beginning of Blue Dragon Plus \"You guys are the best little brother and sister ever!\" - When Marutora and Marumira meet up with Marumaro and Zola in Blue Dragon Plus \"Maro sorry, Lady Zola!\" - Marumaro when you make him attack Zola during their battle \"What? You saw Maro?\" - Marumaro at the end of Blue Dragon \"It's awful! Nene's so mean!\" - Marumaro before he gets his Shadow \"If you give me your panties, I'll tell you anything!\" Marumaro to Kluke in episode 4 \"Lady Zola...\" - when he runs out of health to fight (Awakened Shadow)Trivia Monsters  This is a list of notable monsters that are fought in the Blue Dragon video game. On some occasions, getting specific monsters to attack you will involve attacking another group of monsters. (E.g. Balloon Toad only appears within battles caused by attacking a Kelolon Defender).Classification  Each one is classified as Animal, Ghost, Magical Creature, or Mecha.Animal Ghost Magical Creature Mecha External Links Delphinium  Delphinium is a Character in the Blue Dragon anime who has served as both an antagonist and protagonist in the series. She is a former spy from Gran Kingdom, who later joined the White Guardians, which she would eventually defect from.Personality  Delphinium's personality is difficult to pinpoint, due to her mysterious demeanor, unknown origins,\u00a0and frequent changing of allegiances. During her first few appearances, she rarely speaks, and projects the image of a ruthless killer, who disposes of those she no longer has any use for, such as Salinas and, to a certain extent, Gilliam. As the series progresses, more of Delphinium begins to show through. In general, she is calm, cool, and collected, able to think clearly regardless of the situation. This was probably best seen when she fought Hildegard, as Delphinium was able to fool Hildegard in believing she was confident, despite knowing that she couldn't actually defeat Hildegard. In addition, Delphinium often taunts and mocks her enemies, seemingly enjoying getting a rise out of them. She does this many times throughout the series, particularly to Shu, Jiro, and General Logi. Delphinium's true loyalties and objectives\u00a0are left more or less unexplained, as she frequently betrays those who she has aligned with. When she was first introduced, she was working under the direct command of General Logi, whom she appeared to be loyal to. After Logi turned on Gran Kingdom and formed Rosekstan, Delphinium betrayed him and attempted to assassinate him, revealing herself to have actually been serving Nene. Later, she reveals her allegiance to Deathroy after freeing him, and seemingly remains loyal to him for the duration of the series, though her goals remain a mystery. She later joins the White Guardians, seemingly having some past connection with Dr. Tarkovsky, however, she later defects for unclear reasons and leaks information on the White Guardians to Rosekstan. Despite her negative qualities, Delphinium does, on occasion, display some positive traits as well. She seems to, at least to some extent, care about the world and desire to protect it. When Zola unleashes the Darkness upon the world, Delphinium becomes surprisingly emotional, seemingly consumed with the one goal of defeating Zola. This was to such an extent that Delphinium's confrontation with Zola became the only known occasion where Delphinium lost her cool and acted solely on impulse and emotion, allowing Zola to easily defeat her. Delphinium also showed some level of care for Jiro, repeatedly sparing his life despite his frequent attempts to kill her. After having Noi reawaken Chimera, Delphinium chose to hold true to her word an release Bouquet because the alternative would require her to kill Jiro. When Jiro was following her when she was first joining the White Guardians, Delphinium drove him off and gave him what appeared to be a genuine warning not to go any further because of the danger. When she finally arrived at the Legion's stronghold, Delphinium immediately saved Jiro's life and jumped into action alongside him.Biography Background  Almost all of Delphinium's background remains unknown. At some point in her life, Delphinium gained an artificial shadow and became a spy for Gran Kingdom. Eventually she was placed under the direct command of General Logi and partnered with Salinas in Jibral City, where they were to sabotage vital equipment and acquire the Extra Seven.Season 1  After Salinas\u00a0is imprisoned, Delphinium retreats to the outskirts of the city, where she observes\u00a0Lt. Dragnov's siege of Jibral. After Dragnov\u00a0is\u00a0forced to retreat, Salinas arrives, having broken out of prison and stolen the Extra Seven. After taking the Extra Seven from Salinas, Delphinium kills him and returns to Logi to deliver the documents on the battleship Norg. Later, Delphinium arrives in the city of Coreed, where she learns that Homeron has been hired to track down the Extra Seven. She confronts Homeron in a bar and attempts to use her shadow to kill him, but he warns her against it, noting that even she would have a difficult time escaping Coreed after killing him. Realizing that he is correct, Delphinium leaves, sparing Homeron's life for the time being. Hearing of the commotion in the area of Castle De La Testa, Delphinium realizes that Homeron is attempting to obtain information on her and the Extra Seven from the Gran Kingdom database. Delphinium breaks into the base and reaches the computer room, however Homeron manages to cloak himself and trick Delphinium into thinking he has already left. Irritated, Delphinium leaves, having failed to kill Homeron once again. Following this, Delphinium receives orders to ensure that the crew of the Norg is killed in the war between Gran Kingdom and Sabalu, so as to prevent Homeron from tracking the Extra Seven to Logi. After locating the Norg's crash site, Delphinium heads there and confronts Homeron for the final time. Homeron, having learned of Logi's involvement, attempts to send a messenger fly to Zola with this information, however Delphinium notices and destroys the fly before using her shadow to mortally wound Homeron just as Shu, Jiro, and Marumaro arrive. Shu attempts to attack Delphinium, however Delphinium easily blocks the attack and flees, believing the crew of the Norg to be dead. Delphinium returns to Logi's ship, where she stands guard over the extra seven during Zola's group's attack. When Bouquet uses her invisibility to steal the Extra Seven, Delphinium is able to detect her and chase her. Delphinium is just barely able to recover the Extra Seven from Bouquet as Logi's ship takes off and flies to safety. After this, Delphinium begins helping Logi translate the Extra Seven, as well as acting as a caretaker to Gilliam, who was severely injured by Zola during the battle. When it becomes clear that Zola's group has managed to obtain a copy of the Extra Seven, Delphinium decides to take matter into her own hands. Recognizing that the still-injured Gillam desires revenge against Zola for the deaths of Todd and Bishop, Delphinium provides him with Black Shadow Type 3's sends him to attack Zola's group. Delphinium later expresses shock upon learning of Nene's death, and even more so when Logi declares war on Gran Kingdom. Though Delphinium pretends to go along with Logi's plans, she attempts to assassinate him in the middle of the night while he is asleep. The attempt fails and Delphinium is forced to flee as Schneider and Andropov arrive to investigate the source of the disturbance. Delphnium then begins working to track down Deathroy. Eventually, Delphinium learns that Zola has imprisoned Deathroy at the sealed grounds and arrives to find Zola's group doing battle with Logi, Schneider, and Andropov. Interrupting the battle, Delphinium frees Deathroy and unleashes Chimera. With all seven shadows of light now gathered, the container imprisoning the Darkness rises, and Delphnium is forced to watch in horror as Zola tricks Shu into unsealing the Darkness, and then disappears into the darkness. After the battle, Delphinium overhears Jiro's story about his first meeting with Zola, and chastises him for his comments about her not seeming suspicious, attempting to convince him and the others to accept the fact that Zola had been using them from the start. Ultimately, Delphinium fails to convince them, and leaves. Now consumed with defeating Zola and stopping the Darkness, Delphinium realizes that the other soldiers of light will need Deathroy, and by extension her, in order to reseal the Darkness. Delphinium goes to Logi's airship to offer an alliance, but upon arrival, finds Logi and Shu fighting over who will get to lead the new alliance. Delphinium breaks up the fight, scolding both Shu and Logi for their childishness, convincing them to put aside their differences and work together. Following this, they all return to a Rosekstan base, where they await Logi's workers to finish creating a badge that will allow them to survive inside the Darkness. After the badges are completed, Delphinium and the other board a Rosekstan airship that will take them into the Darkness. While awaiting their arrival, Delphinium retreats to her room to take a shower. Coming out of the shower, Delphinium finds herself face-to-face with Shu, who intends to kill her to avenge Homeron, since they technically only need Deathroy. However, before the two can square off, the ship is attacked and they both run to the bridge to prepare to disembark. Delphinium, Shu, Logi, Kluke, Jiro, Bouquet, Marumaro, Schneider, and Andropov all exit the ship while the captain sacrifices himself as a distraction to the dark army that attacked the ship. The group begins to progress towards the Sealed Grounds, but are almost immediately attacked by two shadows. Caught off guard by the attack, Delphinium is nearly killed, however Shu tackles her to the ground at the last minute, saving her life. Surprised, Delphinium questions why Shu would save her, to which Shu replies that they do need her and offers his hand. Grinning, Delphinium takes his hand and he helps her to her feet. The group then continues on their way, easily defeating any shadows in their path, and, though they bicker, their teamwork improves tremendously. Eventually they arrive at a massive set of gates, where they are attacked by the Gatekeepers of Darkness. The group struggles against the two monster, which are much stronger than anything they've faced up to this point, however Delphinium and the others are able to make it through the gates thanks to a distraction provide by Logi, Schneider, and Andropov. Logi then joins Delphinium and the others, while Schneider and Andropov remain behind to fight the Gatekeepers.  At last, Delphinium and the others arrive at the Sealed Grounds, where they find Zola waiting for them. Delphinium sits by as Shu questions Zola as to whether this was her intention all along. After Zola confirms that she never though of Shu and the others as friends, Delphinium flies into a rage and attacks Zola, but is blocked. She attempts to use her shadow to attacks Zola from behind, but is repelled and thrown backwards. After Shu's badge is destroyed and he is consumed by the Darkness, Delphinium and the others rise and attempt to attack Zola again, but this proves futile as Zola destroys Jiro's badge this time. Delphinium and the others attempt one final attack,but Zola easily destroys all of their badges, and they are all consumed by darkness. Delphinium drifts alone in the Darkness until Shu's voice eventually reaches her and gives her the will to continue fighting. Delphinium and the others return to the Sealed Grounds, now able to remain in the Darkness without the badges. While Shu fights Zola, Delphinium and the others battle the shadows to keep them from interfering, and to clear a path to the altar. After Shu defeats Zola, Delphinium and the others run to the altar and begin sealing the Darkness, however they quickly realize that they don't possess the power to do so. Shu then instructs them to pour every last drop of power into sealing the Darkness, despite the fact that doing so will cause them to lose their shadows. Even after all this however, they still find themselves just short of completing the sealing process. A physical manifestation of the Darkness appears and taunts them for their lack of power, however Shu insists that they have to ignore it and continue pushing harder. Just as it seems they will not be able to finish the seal, Zola appears and sacrifices herself, providing the last bit of energy needed to seal the Darkness. After the Darkness is sealed, Delphinium and the others find Zola's headband on the ground, and mourn her death in silence. After this, Delphinium leaves with Deathroy.Shadow  Delphinium's shadow is a three-headed hydra/beetle-like creature whose legs Delphinium can partially bring out to defend herself. It shoots out laser beams from its mouth as a second attack.It is a false shadow like killer bat, not an artificial one from Nene. When she rescues Deathroy, Delphinium uses him to summon Chimera.Appearance  In season 1 she has fair skin and long lavender hair that comes down to her waist. She has blue eyes and wears an odd piece of clothing with a white pearl necklace around her throat. Around her waist is a pink belt. When Deathroy shares body with her he floats just above her left shoulder.Trivia Cynthia  Cynthia is a character exclusive to the Blue Dragon anime.Appearance  Cynthia is a young woman with long, reddish-pink hair. Her uniform consists of a mini skirt with a purple tube top and white jacket bearing her insignia.Personality  Cynthia is very similar to the witch in Snow White for she is constantly asking the Gran Kingdom soldiers \"who's the most beautiful girl in the world?\". (she gets mad if they say otherwise) Her temper is extremely short and she can't stand it when Minotaur or Jiro call her \"old lady\" (obaa-san in Japanese). She hates Bouquet because the guards \"fell in love with 'that girl' rather than her\". She might have possible feelings for Andropov, but annoys him a lot and often tries to get his attention by telling him that she loved.Biography  Cynthia is a member of General Logi's Independent Flying Squadron under the rank of Captain. She served as Jiro's rival in the first encounter. Minotaur had managed to call her old many times. After a fierce battle, General Logi ordered his Independent Flying Squadron to retreat. Cynthia tells Jiro that they will battle again another day. She was later seen at a local Gran Kingdom prison where Conrad L. Lawrence and some captive soldiers were held. When Shu and Jiro encountered her at a Gran Kingdom prison, Shu and Jiro fought her alongside Lemaire. Shu and Jiro managed to defeat them as Zola arrives to get them out of there. When she found out from some Gran Kingdom soldiers that Bouquet was more beautiful than her, she sought out Shu's group and attacked Bouquet. The attack caused everyone to fall into Death Valley. Cynthia had to contact Andropov to find her location and find her a way out. To stay close to Cynthia, Bouquet carefully followed her leaving a trail of her clothes for the others to follow before turning invisible. When it came to the exit of Death Valley, Bouquet's cover was blown and she was attacked by Cynthia. When it came to Zola's group planning to storm General Logi's airship to reclaim the Extra Seven, General Logi had her, Gilliam, Todd, and Bishop as the first line of defense. Each member was given a Power Booster to increase the strength of their shadows. In the final encounter with Shu, Jiro, Kluke, and Bouquet the children,\u00a0Cynthia was ultimately defeated by Jiro after overloading her Power Booster, which resulted in her death in episode 26.Shadow  Cynthia's shadow is Yarovit, a pink monster who can stretch its arms out and even turn it into tentacles. It can also sprout tentacles from it's back, and curl itself into a ball to ram at an enemy.Trivia Deathroy  Deathroy is a tiny creature attached to Nene's shoulder on a long gold stick. He appears arms folded and repeats what Nene says in a dramatic way. In the last part of the story, Deathroy becomes enormously important and becomes the last boss.Appearance  Deathroy has the appearance of a frog-like tiny creature, probably no bigger than 3 inches. His lower half is concealed by machinery, although this is actually merely used as a tether to Nene's shoulder. When released, Deathroy takes the full appearance of a Frog.Game Story  In the story, Deathroy is mainly Nene's sidekick with no\u00a0active role until the end. After Nene was killed by Zola and the collar of light was used, Deathroy tells his true story and origins, and, having swallowed Nene's light sphere, enters his true form: Destroy. He seems to liquefy like a caterpillar in a cocoon with Szabo in the center. He says in a deeper voice how he feels his power returning. After Destroy has fully transformed, cutscenes occur showing flashbacks of murals in areas like Pachess Town, Mural Town and the Talta ancient ruins. He says he was the most powerful biological weapon ever created, and the boss battle that ensues after proves this to be correct. He has incredible attacks, such as Final Judgment, which involves a massive thunder attack. Oddly, he seems to do less damage than Nene with the eternal engine, although he has a larger array of attacks.Anime Blue Dragon  Deathroy's role is the same in the anime minus the true last boss part. Following Nene's destruction, he partners with Delphinium and\u00a0is revealed to be the true wielder of Chimera and grants Nene the ability to manipulate it since Deathroy cannot summon him by himself. Zola abducted Deathroy without anyone noticing and hid him in the Sealed Grounds. He was rescued by Delphinium and by using her artificial shadow Chimera becomes hers to manipulate with Deathroy, while still having her beetle/hydra shadow. Deathroy and Delphinium join in the final battle, with Chimera sealed after Zola in demon form is defeated.Tenkai no Shichi Ryuu  Two years later, Deathroy continues to partner with Delphinium and regains Chimera by forcing Noi to after taking Bouquet hostage. When it came to fight with Hildegard, Deathroy directly uses his power to save Delphinium. He and Delphinium later help out in the final battle with Rudolph.Blue Dragon (character)  Blue Dragon (\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3 Buruu Doragon) is the mascot Shadow, belonging to the main protagonist, Shu in the Blue Dragon universe. In the anime, Shu and Blue Dragon's relationship started off rocky due to its rampaging behavior prior to its debut.Appearance  Blue Dragon's appearance physically is that of a very powerful and intimidating nature with his ripped arms and huge chest muscles, as well as the massive wings on his back. Like most other shadows, the dragon has aesthetic accessories on its body, this one being gold rings around the horns. Only in his merged and fusion forms, he gains powerful hind legs and spike tail to kick his opponents. In his fusion form with Bouquet and Hippopotamus, he is equipped with plated armor, with armguards and the left side with a sword attached. The sword can shoot energy bullets, and powerful enough to pierce shields depending on how much energy Shu inserts. In his fusion form with Noi, most of his limbs (head, chest, forearms and legs) are taloned with black and gold ornaments, increasing in both speed and agility. After achieving his true form upon merging with Shu, he has three horns on his head, two appendages under his jaws and horn-like appendages from neck to tail and a spike at the tip of his tail.Personality  Upon Shu's inadvertently summoning at first, Blue Dragon appears very violent and extremely cold, not caring about others but himself. But as the series progresses, Blue Dragon begins to respect Shu for his strength of the heart with the value of companionship.Background  Unlike some other shadows, this one seems to be almost humorous in end of battle statistics, although it is the most brutal of them and has the most brutal animations for physical and spell attacks. Shu is the first one to get back his shadow after Nene takes it. In fact, he may already have had a shadow before the Flying Fortress event. This is because he seems to have his instantly back just after Nene takes it. It is the only shadow in the game to fully mimic its master's movements once he wins the battle. The shadow has strangely different amounts of SP earned compared to others, even with the use of a Black Belt he seems to have a much higher rank than others by a considerable margin of 20 ranks if the player has a high-level party. The Shadow's corporeal form has him gain legs with two front toes and a back toe and a spiked tail, as well as green eyes. In this form, following Shu's movements as he normally does slashing at the enemy with two blades of energy from its claws forming a giant X in the ground. It then shoots a fireball at the center of the X causing massive damage to the opponent.Game  In Blue Dragon Plus, Blue Dragon's only class is the Magic Sword class, and its corporeal attack, exclusive to Shu (or an attack similar to it) named after the shadow itself like the other shadows, Blue Dragon, causes blue fire in the shape of itself to rise up then rain down blue and orange fireballs. In Blue Dragon: Awakened Shadow it appears for a short while in the beginning but then Shu loses the ability to use it just the other characters who originally had a shadow. A new version of this shadow controlled by the player and every other previous player character assigned to it appears in this game too. This one's horns were straighter, had bracelets around its hands, and lacked the spades on its back compared to the original.Anime  In the anime, Blue Dragon is a Shadow (originally a powerful dragon transformed into a shadow by a spell) that was admired, feared, and even worshipped as the embodiment of destruction, striking fear between friend and foe. It is revealed by Killer Bat that he is a direct descendant of the first Darkness, thus possessing power far greater than any mere shadow. At the start, Blue Dragon was summoned when Shu wanted to protect his village from falling debris. Shu finds him uncontrollable due to his violent and arrogant behavior. It was not later until Shu's fight with Ivanov and Gustav where he trained enough power to control him. While Blue Dragon still retained his arrogant behavior, he remained disobedient while awaiting the chance for freedom. But as the series progresses, the bond between Shu and Blue Dragon began to deepen saying he liked fighting alongside him. He and the other shadows were sacrificed to reseal the darkness at the end of the first season. In the second season, Blue Dragon was reawakened by Noi to fend off against Mikhael. After learning of the Investiture Beings and their plan eradicate humanity, Blue Dragon once gain assists Shu and the others despite facing off against actual kin. Throughout the series, Blue Dragon is given the ability to temporarily merge with various characters to battle stronger opponents. Finally towards the season's end, Noi reveals his last resort in order to defeat Rudolph. Shu and Blue Dragon must merge as one like the time inside the Darkness, with great risks of Shu disappearing forever. But Shu managed to sustain himself as Blue Dragon managed to successfully destroy Fagino with his true power unleashed and fully awakaened.Attacks (Anime)  He emits yellow flame from his mouth and can inflict powerful punches. When Shu and Blue Dragon were absorbed by darkness and after coming out of it, they gained a new level of power due to which Blue Dragon was able to create his colossal shadow from the power of darkness to counter demon Zola.True Dragon Form  First appears in Episode 50 after Shu was swallowed by the Darkness. Shu finally gained access to the ability with Noi's assistance to be on even terms with Rudolph. Blue Dragon becomes a full corporeal dragon with lower appendages, powerful enough to thrash enemies in close combat. His blue energy flame attacks have become powerful, lethal and penetrative enough to overpower Fagino and Rudolph's clones without any trouble. Also he can engulf his fists with blue energy to do a blaster punch and when given enough power can release the energy to do a kind of blue flare cannon strike attack which is Blue Dragon's most powerful attack to be known. It is to be noted that when he releases his energy in his true form, the sky and the surrounding will turn blue though it was shown only once when Blue Dragon was summoned by Shu when Noi awakened him. His unique ability is that he can enter overdrive when a huge surge of power is generated by Shu causing Blue Dragon to push his limits and obtain a tremendous amount of power that boosts all of his abilities to extreme levels giving him the name known as Heavenly Dragon. This ability is activated when Shu wants to protect someone when he doesn't have enough power. The mechanism behind overdrive is the unison <between light and darkness which in Blue Dragon's case is combined power of Shu's will to protect others and Blue Dragon's courage to take on any powerful foe. When Shu becomes weak Blue Dragon's body absorbs him due to which they become immobile and Blue Dragons body turns black. In the final episode, Blue Dragon can now summon himself at will without Shu's help.Trivia Blue Dragon Plus  Blue Dragon Plus (\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9 Bur\u016b Doragon Purasu) is a Japanese RPG designed by Mistwalker and developed by Feelplus and Brownie Brown and published by AQ Interactive in Japan, for the Nintendo DS video game console and is based on the Blue Dragon series. The game was revealed by the Japanese magazine Shonen Jump, and released on September 4, 2008. On December 13, the first screens were shown in Shonen Jump, showing that the game will use 2D sprite graphics. Also revealed was the game's true genre, which is TRPG (tactical role-playing game), likely similar to the Fire Emblem series.Story  One year after the events of the original game, the world continues to embrace and explore the cube worlds that resulted from the opening of the planet's core. One day King Jibral and Zola encounter a mysterious evil dragon shadow at one of the cubes. Zola has a bad feeling about it and after informing Shu and the party, they find themselves on another adventure to discover this new threat.Playable Characters  The following is a list of the playable characters in the game. Each character is able to wield their own Shadow.Trivia Sahlia  Sahlia is a native of Devour Village, town of the dead.Biography  Her parents died saving her from the flesh-eating tree Eat Yeet. She has a talent for baking cookies. Sahlia's usually detached from the rest of the town seeing how she just wants to die because her parents are no longer alive. If the player asks her where Jiro, Kluke, and Marumaro are for the second time when you first arrive, she'll get angry and say, \"I told you I don't know where your friends are! Stop bothering me!\" or something like that. The night after Shu fights Eat Yeet without his Shadow, Kluke goes into a coma and seeing how he can't use magic, goes up to the cliff where you can get a good look at all the moons aligned together. Sahlia then walks on the cliff and goes to the edge. She leans forward, but Shu saves her before she can fall to her death. Sahlia fights back, but ends up falling only to be saved by Shu. When she's pulled back up, she demands to know why he saved her. Shu tells her that she shouldn't give up on life and that she isn't the only person whose parents had died. Seeing how he no longer has his Shadow, he gives up on trying to persuade her to live and tells her to go ahead. Nothing mattered anymore. When the sun begins to rise, Jiro finds both of them on the cliff and Shu manages to get his Shadow back after he tells Jiro that Sahlia nearly killed herself. Thanks to Sahlia, Shu's able to get back his Shadow, but only him. Sahlia's only question towards them is, \"What are you people?\" The next day, after Shu, Jiro, Kluke, and Marumaro defeat Eat Yeet and leave Devour Village, Sahlia stops them and gives Shu and the gang a bag of her homemade cookies. Shu and Sahlia then shake hands, and Marumaro comes over. He asks Sahlia if she likes Shu (receiving a punch on the head from Shu himself), but her only reply is, \"I'd say...I respect him.\" She makes another appearance at the end of the game during Kluke's birthday party.Blue Dragon Plus  She makes an appearance in Blue Dragon Plus as a playable character. In the beginning, she snuck onto the Land Shark with Marutora and Marumira (Marumaro's brother and sister). She tells them to stay close, but all three trigger a trap and the floor opens underneath them. When Shu is looking for Nene along with his friend (or by himself), she falls out of an air vent if you take a specific route. If you head right to Nene without taking the path of enemies, Sahlia won't join your team. Shu tells her that it's dangerous and that she should go home, but Sahlia points out that he told her to never give up on life and summons a Shadow of her own. Shu then decides that she can come, and Sahlia says, \"As long as you're with me, I'm fine!\" Shu blushes and says back, \"Whatever.\" It is implied during Blue Dragon Plus, that Sahlia has a secret crush on Shu. Sahlia's Shadow takes the form of a fat cat known as Cat Genie. Her Shadow has the ability to lower defense, speed, attack, and magic. Better known as status killers. Defense Killer, Speed Killer, Attack Killer, and Magic Killer are the spells real name. She can also learn spells that can kill certain enemies in one hit like One-Hit Wonder, Beast Killer and Ghost Killer.Blue Dragon: Awakened Shadow  Sahlia appears again in the new game Blue Dragon Awakened Shadow as a character specialized in \"martial art\" weapons and healing magic. Throughout the game, she is trying to win Shu's love over Kluke, her rival. In the first quest you meet Sahlia (\"Shu's Birthday\"), she asks Shu what he'd like for his birthday. However, Shu, Sahlia, and the player's character are completely blind to the fact that Kluke is listening from the other end of the garden. Sahlia asks the main character (you; the player) if he/she could assist in finding the perfect present. Shu insists that you go, which starts the quest \"Shu's Birthday\". With that, he runs off and soon after, Kluke comes in. Her and Sahlia get into a bit of an \"argument\", but the tension is sliced away when Sahlia pops the big question: \"Hey, I've been wondering. Are uh, you in love with Shu?\" That's when Sahlia adds: \"I love him. And I have no intention of hiding my feelings from him. Because I've learned so much from him...\" Kluke, not expecting this, comes to the truth and says \"That's not what I was expecting.\" Sahlia asks why she's bothering to get him a birthday present to which she replies she's turning the favor. As the scene comes to an end, the player has a choice whether to get Kluke's materials for her present, or Sahlia's. To get Sahlia's, the player must first head to Fushira's workshop and receive the \"Large Box\". From there, head to the Jibral Grasslands to obtain the last material \"Lovely Lid\". If Sahlia wins, she combines the ingredients at Yasato's house which creates a \"Lunchbox\" which she plans on filling up with food for Shu. As a reward, Sahlia hands over a \"Barrier Hat\" (C ranked armor for the beginning) and promises that she'll fight by the player's side when needed. As the game progresses, the player will see Sahlia sitting on a bench, looking stumped. The character asks what's wrong to which she replies she saw Shu with Kluke. When the quest is accepted, Sahlia gets a sudden burst of joy, thinking that she won't get anywhere just sitting around and feeling sorry for herself. She plans on making \"Ultimate Cookies\" for Shu and the hero is suddenly dragged into yet another quest. The ingredients needed can be located on (in order) Jibral Castle Town Cube, Lago Village Cube, and the Desert Cube. After the ingredients are gathered, the player will wind up in Sahlia's house, where she begins baking cookies. Just then, Shu runs in and states that he saw the hero go in, but what really drew him was that \"delicious smell\". Shu begs to have a taste, but Sahlia keeps him away with \"it's a surprise\". Outside, Kluke happens to be walking by and is drawn in by the smell. Sahlia places the cookie on the table, and, from her position, Kluke tells Shu not to eat the cookie. If the player says \"yes\" to the question, then Shu will eat the cookie and get a bad stomach ache. In anger, Kluke charges down Sahlia's stairs and yells at her. She turns towards Shu and plans on bringing him to her hospital, but Shu cuts her off saying he \"faked\" a stomach ache to surprise Sahlia. Kluke then leaves, miffed about the fact Shu acted it out. Once she's gone, Shu collapses and Sahlia asks if he lied to protect her which he replies \"Well, I couldn't let you take all the blame\". The hero leaves and Sahlia hands him some medicine. She then thanks him with all her heart, handing over a \"Spell Heart\" and \"Guard Heart\". At the end of the game, if Shu ate the cookie, it shows Sahlia and Shu sitting next to each other in King Jibral's throne room. Sahlia asks if Shu would like to go somewhere far away with her after the banquet. To this, he asks \"Where too?\" but she replies \"As long as we're together, it doesn't matter where we go.\" The two move closer to each other while Kluke, sad by the fact her love and Sahlia are that close, sits there and watch.Quotes  \"I'd say...I respect him.\" - Before Shu and the gang leave Devour Village \"As long as you're with me, I'm fine.\" - When Shu tells her that she can come along \"You told me not to give up on life, so I'm coming!\" - When Shu tells her that it's dangerous where they are right now \"How can he not understand what she's talking about?\" - After Himiko tells Shu that Nene was the kindest person she met \"My parents...they died saving me from that monster...\" - When Sahlia tries explaining to Shu why she was going to commit suicide. \"All we do is wait to be eaten by that monster.

With her clairvoyant foreknowledge to alter destiny, she is always placed under intense security with the Guardians' commander Vermillion as her bodyguard, and with a rebuilt General Szabo as her personal attendant. She conducts in rituals to perceive into the future for the Guardians to plan their military tactics and strategic maneuvers.Plot  Primella is actually Zola's reincarnation after her good essence was expelled from the Darkness. The essence was eventually discovered by Dr. Tarkovsky who placed it into a homunculus vessel and later adopting the latter as her own granddaughter. Because of her origins, Primella's clairvoyance was used by Dr. Tarkovsky to change the world by eliminating all Shadows. Upon such, she would contact Shu in his dreams until they finally met in Nirvana. When it came to her latest visions revolving around Shu and the Guardians fighting Fagino and Rottarace killing Kluke in a flower field, she persuaded Vermillion to accompany to where Shu is and deliver the news. Following Vermillion's sacrifice, she and General Szabo traveled with Shu while Noi, Bouquet, and Marumaro went to see to their own missions. Upon reuniting with the White Guardians, she was able to persuade her grandfather to call a truce with both Shu and Rosekstan. During the fight with Rudolph, Shu learned about Primella's origins and her \"destined fate\" of sacrificing herself to release the energy in her body to destroy the Investiture Beings. But Shu managed to prevent that date from happening, where he managed to destroy Rudolph and ending the conflict. Following Rudolph's destruction, she gave medals to Shu, Bouquet, and Marumaro.General Szabo  General Szabo is a character in the Blue Dragon video game and anime series.History Blue Dragon (video game)  Szabo was the general of Nene's Mecha Robo army and confronted the heroes many times throughout the course of the game. When the heroes invade Nene's floating fortress, he is ordered by Nene to release the Demon King Robots in order to stop them from shutting down the fortress' Eternal Engines. Despite this, they are still able to shut all but one of the engines. When Nene attempts to escape, Szabo confronts the heroes only to get destroyed. Szabo later appears at Nene's base, having been reconstructed and upgraded to Grand Szabo along with the Demon King Robots, but are still defeated. During the final assault against on Nene, Szabo and the Demon Kings have once again been rebuilt, but then they fuse together to create Ultimate Szabo, and are once again defeated by the heroes. After this defeat, Szabo turns against Nene and assists the heroes during the final battle.Blue Dragon Plus  In Blue Dragon Plus we find out that Szabo is now working with King Jibral. Upon inspecting a cube with Shu, Zola and Marumaro he is ambushed by his former servants \"The Demon Kings\" and is forced to become ultimate Szabo again. Szabo pleas the robots to stop but then has his Soul engine ripped out and steals a light sphere that was thrown away by Zola in the previous installment of the games. Shu and the gang then find Szabo as he returns the light sphere that Zola had thrown away back to Nene. Szabo is then defeated and escapes. Much later in the story, Ultimate Szabo appears again and defeated once more upon which Szabo gets a new Soul engine, returns to his senses and rejoins the gang and makes it clear that he now has a shadow too.Blue Dragon (Anime)  In the anime, General Szabo was the one who attacked Muffei resulting in the death of Jiro's family. Shu and Co. encountered him within Nene's castle. After Shu and Zola defeated the Black Shadow Type-Two robots, Jiro and Minotaur destroyed him. General Szabo is later rebuilt when it came to Nene's attack on Jibral. Sometime later, he attacks Jiro with his Mighty Quartet: Sy, Kessou, Mike and Coop. General Szabo later merges with them to form \"Ultimate Szabo.\" Jiro and Minotaur manage to destroy General Szabo and his robots. General Szabo was salvaged and rebuilt again, but missing part of his left face. He briefly engaged Shu and Co. at the Hippopotamus Ruins, but fell back when Nene's fortress dropped the Hippopotamus Ruins from the fortress down toward Coreed. When Nene's fortress was stormed, General Szabo used Black Shadow Type-Three robots with nanobot technology on Shu and the others. Bouquet and Hippopotamus confronted him in the control room. In the form of one of those robots, Bouquet managed to copy their attack that sent General Szabo into the air where he exploded.Blue Dragon: Trials of the 7 Shadows  Two years later, he was rebuilt by Dr. Tarkovsky as a member of the White Guardians and Primella's servant with his memories reset. He was attacked by Jiro during their returning encounter until Primella covered for him, complying he has no memories before.", "WARFRAME Wiki": "WARFRAME Wiki ", "WARFRAME Wiki PT-BR ": "WARFRAME Wiki PT-BR  ", "Magyar Warframe Wiki": "Magyar Warframe Wiki ", "5 things to do to become a god in warframe Wiki": "5 things to do to become a god in warframe Wiki ", "\u041d\u0435 Warframe Wiki": "\u041d\u0435 Warframe Wiki ", "Tales of the Awakened: A Warframe RP Universe Wiki": "Tales of the Awakened: A Warframe RP Universe Wiki ", "SEO Internal Test WARFRAME Wiki": "SEO Internal Test WARFRAME Wiki ", "Swordz.io Wiki": "Swordz.io Wiki ", "Smallfish Chess Wiki": "Smallfish Chess Wiki ", "Yellow Dragon Chess Wiki": "Yellow Dragon Chess Wiki ", "The Elder Scrolls Wiki": "The Elder Scrolls Wiki ", "WikiCube": "WikiCube Rubik's Cube (3x3x3) Conception and development  The Rubik's Magic Cube was first released to Budapest toy shops in 1980. The progress of the Cube towards the toy shop shelves of the West was then briefly halted so that it could be manufactured to Western safety and packaging specifications. A lighter Cube was produced, and Ideal Toys decided to rename it. \"The Gordian Knot\" and \"Inca Gold\" were considered, but the company finally decided on \"Rubik's Cube\", and the first batch was exported from Hungary in May 1980. Taking advantage of an initial shortage of Cubes, many cheap imitations appeared. In 1994, Ideal lost a patent infringement suit by Larry Nichols for his US patent #3655201. Terutoshi Ishigi acquired Japanese patent JP55\u20128192 for a nearly identical mechanism while Rubik's patent was being processed, but Ishigi is generally credited with an independent reinvention.Popularity  Over one hundred million cubes were sold in the period from 1980 to 1982. It won the BATR Toy of the Year award in 1990 and again in 1991. Many similar puzzles were released shortly after the Rubik's Cube, both from Rubik himself and from other sources, including the Rubik's Revenge, a 4\u00d74\u00d74 version of the Rubik's Cube. There are also 2\u00d72\u00d72 and 5\u00d75\u00d75 Cubes (known as the Pocket Cube and the Professor's Cube, respectively) and puzzles in other shapes, such as the Pyraminx, a tetrahedron. In May 2005, the Greek inventor Pavina Verdes constructed a 6\u00d76\u00d76 Rubik's Cube; on May 23, 2006. Frank Morris, a world champion Rubik's Cube solver, tested this version. He had previously solved the 3\u00d73\u00d73 in 15 seconds, the 4\u00d74\u00d74 in 1 minute and 10 seconds, and the 5\u00d75\u00d75 in 1 minute and 46.1 seconds. The 6\u00d76\u00d76 took him 5 minutes and 37 seconds to solve. Morris himself thanked the inventor for making it and purportedly stated that the bigger the Cube is, the greater the pleasure. In July 2006, Mr. Verdes successfully constructed the 7\u00d77\u00d77 cube; on October 27, 2006. a video of Morris testing the cube was released. He solved this cube in 6 minutes and 29.31 seconds. Videos of these tests can be viewed at http://www.olympicube.com. In 1994, Melinda Green, Don Hatch, and Jay Berkenilt created a model of a 3\u00d73\u00d73\u00d73 four-dimensional analogue of a Rubik's Cube in Java, called the MagicCube4D. Having more possible states than there are atoms in the known universe, only 55 people have solved it as of January 2007. [1] In 2006, Roice Nelson and Charlie Nevill created a 3\u00d73\u00d73\u00d73\u00d73 Fifth dimension|five-dimensional model. As of January 2007, it has been solved by only 7 people. [2] In 1981, Patrick Bossert, a twelve-year-old schoolboy from England, published his own solution in a book called You Can Do The Cube (ISBN 0-14-031483-0). The book sold over 1.5 million copies worldwide in seventeen editions and became the number one book on The Times. He didn't reach the New York Times Best Seller list for that year [3]. At the height of the puzzle's popularity, separate sheets of coloured stickers were sold so that frustrated or impatient Cube owners could restore their puzzle to its original appearance. The name \"Rubik's Cube\" is common in many languages except Hebrew and in Hungarian. In the first, it is known as the \"Hungarian Cube\", whilst in the second, its name is \"Magic Cube\" (B\u0171v\u00f6s kocka). Recently, Greek inventor Panagiotis Verdes patented a method of creating cubes beyond the 5\u00d75\u00d75, up to 11\u00d711\u00d711 level. His designs, which include improved mechanisms for the 3\u00d73\u00d73, 4\u00d74\u00d74, and 5\u00d75\u00d75, are suitable for speed cubing, whereas existing designs for cubes larger than 3\u00d73\u00d73 are prone to breaking. As of April 2007, these designs are still being tested and are not widely available yet, although videos of actual, working prototypes for the 6\u00d76\u00d76 and 7\u00d77\u00d77 have been released. In more recent times, cube technology has developed to the point where these designs (known as V-Cubes) are inferior. Fully working cubes up to 11x11 have been constructed (from brands such as Shengshou). Other high-order cubes include the 13x13 (the largest mass produced cube), the 17x17 and 22x22 (as of June 2016, the largest NxNxN puzzle ever produced). Speedube brand Moyu are currently working on mass-producing a 15x15.Workings  A standard Cube measures approximately 2.25 inches (5.7 cm) on each side. The puzzle consists of the 26 unique miniature cubes (\"cubies\") on the surface. However, the centre cube of each face is merely a single square facade; all are affixed to the core mechanisms. These provide structure for the other pieces to fit into and rotate around. So there are twenty-one pieces: a single core piece consisting of three intersecting axes holding the six centre squares in place but letting them rotate, and twenty smaller plastic pieces which fit into it to form the assembled puzzle. The Cube can be taken apart without much difficulty, typically by turning one side through a 45\u00b0 angle and prying an \"edge cubie\" away from a \"centre cubie\" until it dislodges (however, prying loose a corner cubie is a good way to break off a centre cubie - thus ruining the cube). Recent speedcubes (as of June 2016) have more of an anti-popping mechanism, so it is advisable to instead take off a centre cap and unscrew/ loosen a side. It is a simple process to solve a Cube by taking it apart and reassembling it in a solved state; however, this is not the challenge. There are twelve \"edge pieces\" which show two coloured sides each, and eight \"corner pieces\" which show three colours. Each piece shows a unique colour combination, but not all combinations are present (for example, there is no edge piece with both red and orange sides, if red and orange are on opposite sides of the solved Cube.). The location of these cubes relative to one another can be altered by twisting an outer third of the Cube 90\u00b0, 180\u00b0 or 270\u00b0, but the location of the coloured sides relative to one another in the completed state of the puzzle cannot be altered: it is fixed by the relative positions of the centre squares and the distribution of colour combinations on edge and corner pieces. For most recent Cubes, the \"colours\" of the stickers are red opposite orange, yellow opposite white, and green opposite blue. However, cubes with alternative colour arrangements also exist, for example they might have yellow face opposite the green, and the blue face opposite the white (with red and orange opposite faces remaining unchanged).Permutations  A normal (3\u00d73\u00d73) Rubik's Cube can have (8! \u00d7 3) \u00d7 (12! \u00d7 2)/2 = 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 different positions (permutations), or about 4.3 \u00d7 10, forty-three quintillion (short scale) or forty-three trillion (long scale), but the puzzle is advertised as having only \"1000000000 (number)|billions]]\" of positions, due to the general incomprehensibility of such a large number to laymen. Despite the vast number of positions, all Cubes can be solved in twenty or fewer moves. To put this into perspective, if every permutation of a Rubik's Cube was lined up end to end, it would stretch out approximately 261 light years. If they were laid side by side, it would cover the Earth approximately 256 times. In fact, there are (8! \u00d7 3) \u00d7 (12! \u00d7 2) = 519,024,039,293,878,272,000 (about 519 quintillion on the short scale) possible arrangements of the pieces that make up the Cube, but only one in twelve of these are actually reachable. This is because there is no sequence of moves that will swap a single pair or rotate a single corner or edge cube. Thus there are twelve possible sets of reachable configurations, sometimes called \"universes\" or \"orbits\", into which the Cube can be placed by dismantling and reassembling it.Centre faces  The original and still official Rubik's Cube has no markings on the centre faces. This obscures the fact that the centre faces can rotate independently. If you have a marker pen, you could, for example, mark the central squares of an unshuffled Cube with four coloured marks on each edge, each corresponding to the colour of the adjacent square. Some Cubes have also been produced commercially with markings on all of the squares, such as the Lo Shu magic square or playing card suits. Thus one can scramble and then unscramble the Cube yet have the markings on the centres rotated, and it becomes an additional challenge to \"solve\" the centres as well. These cubes are known as 'supercubes'. Putting markings on the Rubik's Cube increases the challenge chiefly because it expands the set of distinguishable possible configurations. When the Cube is unscrambled apart from the orientations of the central squares, there will always be an even number of squares requiring a quarter turn. Thus there are 4/2 = 2,048 possible configurations of the centre squares in the otherwise unscrambled position, increasing the total number of Cube permutations from 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 (4.3\u00d710)to 88,580,102,706,155,225,088,000 (8.9\u00d710), an increase of more than 2000 times.Solutions  Many general solutions for the Rubik's Cube have been discovered independently. The most popular method was developed by David Singmaster and published in the book Notes on Rubik's Magic Cube in 1980. This solution involves solving the Cube layer by layer, in which one layer, designated the top, is solved first, followed by the middle layer, and then the final and bottom layer. Other general solutions include \"corners first\" methods or combinations of several other methods. Speedcubing solutions have been developed for solving the Rubik's Cube as quickly as possible. The most common speedcubing solution was developed, in part, by Jessica Fridrich. It is a very efficient layer-by-layer method that requires a large number of algorithms, especially for orienting and permuting the last layer. The first layer corners and second layer are done simultaneously, with each corner paired up with a second-layer edge piece. Another well-known method was developed by Lars Petrus. In this method, a 2\u00d72\u00d72 section is solved first, followed by a 2x2x3, and then the incorrect edges are solved using a 3 move algorithm, which eliminates the need for a 32 move algorithm later. One of the advantages of this method is that it tends to give solutions in fewer moves. For this reason the method is also popular for fewest move competitions. Solutions typically follow a series of steps, and include a set of algorithms for solving each step. An algorithm, also known as a process or an operator, is a series of twists that accomplishes a particular goal. For instance, one algorithm might switch the locations of three corner pieces, while leaving the rest of the pieces in place. Basic solutions require learning as few as 4 or 5 algorithms but are generally inefficient, needing around 100 twists on average to solve an entire cube. In comparison, Fridrich's advanced solution requires learning 53+ algorithms, but allows the cube to be solved in only 55 moves on average. A different kind of solution developed by Ryan Heise uses no algorithms but rather teaches a set of underlying principles that can be used to solve in fewer than 40 moves. A number of complete solutions can also be found in any of the books listed in the bibliography, and most can be used to solve any Cube in under five minutes. These solutions typically are intended to be easy to learn, but much effort has gone into finding even faster solutions to Rubik's Cube (see Optimal solutions for Rubik's Cube).Move notation  Article: Notation.Competitions  Many speedcubing competitions have been held to determine who can solve the Rubik's Cube in the shortest time. From 2003 - 2006 there have been 72 official competitions with 33 of them in 2006 alone. The first world championship organized by the Guinness Book of World Records was held in Munich on March 13, 1981. All cubes were moved 40 times and rubbed with petroleum jelly. Official winner with a record of 38 seconds was Jury Froeschl, born in Munich. The first international world championship was held in Budapest on June 5, 1982, and was won by Minh Thai, a Vietnamese student from Los Angeles, with a time of 22.95 seconds. Many individuals have recorded shorter times, but these records were not recognized due to lack of compliance with agreed-upon standards for timing and competing. Only records set during official World Cube Association (WCA)-sanctioned tournaments are acknowledged. In 2004, the WCA established a new set of standards, with a special timing device called a Stackmat timer. Currently, the official world record is held by SeungBeom Cho, at 4.59 seconds at the ChicaGhosts 2017 in USA. Feliks Zemdegs holds the official world record average at 5.80 seconds, set at Malaysia Cube Open 2017 in Malaysia.Rubik's Cube in popular culture Notes References External links Fridrich Method  Fridrich Method is one of the most commonly used methods in speedsolving a Rubik's Cube. This method is first developed by a group of cubers and popularized by Jessica Fridrich. It works on a layer by layer method, first solving a cross on the bottom (cross), continuing to solve the first two layers (F2L), orienting the last layer (OLL), and finally permuting the last layer algorithms (PLL). This method is commonly referred to as CFOP.\u00a0Basic Rules  The notation that will be used here is as follows:Layers  R - Right face L - Left face\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 U - Up face D - Down face F - Front face B - Back face M - Slice between R and L (Middle) E - Slice between U and D (Equator/ Equatorial) S - Slice between F and B (Side) x - whole cube in direction of R y - whole cube in direction of U z - whole cube in direction of FTurns  No Suffix - clockwise ' - opposite (ex. x' is turn the whole cube to the left 2 - half turn/180\u00b0 turn w or lowercase letter - double layer quarter-turn/90\u00b0 clockwise w' or lowercase letter - double layer quarter-turn/90\u00b0 counter-clockwise w2 or lowercase letter - double layer half-turn/180\u00b0 turnCross  Solving the cross is the first step in solving the Rubik's cube using CFOP. This involves solving the four edge pieces on one side. The cross can be solved on any side, although many people solve it on the white. The method that is preferred by most is solving on the bottom. The method explained here will solve the cross on the bottom. When solving the cross, you do not have to worry about matching the edges to the individual sides. You must only make sure that the pieces are correctly positioned in relation to all the other cross pieces. You can turn the bottom face to match the pieces after the cross is done. This is usually the simplest step and takes expert speed cubers 2-3 seconds.First 2 Layers  The first two layers, or F2L, is the next step in solving the Rubik's cube using CFOP. It involves placing the bottom corners and middle edges in one step. There are 41 algorithms to learn for solving this step, and seven or eight others that are useful to know. Some speedcubers recommend figuring this step out on your own, so that you can understand exactly why this step works as well as it does. This is the longest step in CFOP, due to the fact that you must perform four algorithms, one for each corner-edge pair, or c/e pair.Orienting the Last Layer  The Orientation of the Last Layer, or OLL, is the second to the last step to solving a Rubik's cube using CFOP. It is when you get all the yellow parts (or the opposite of where you started) of the individual Cubies on the top. This step involves manipulating the top layer so that the top is a solid color, even if the pieces are not in the right places. This step involves learning the most algorithms (57) of any step due to the fact that there are so many different combinations of the top layer.Permuting the Last Layer  Permuting the Last Layer, or PLL, finishes the cube by permutating the last layer. All of the last layer pieces are moved to their proper locations. This uses algorithms called \"perms\", which permute the pieces in the needed way.Roux Method Gilles Roux Method  The Roux method is not widely used, but has shown its potential through many sub 15 achievements by Austin Moore, Thom Barlow and Jules Manalang and sub 10 achievements by Alexander Lau.It works with block building, similarly to Petrus, but in a different fashion. You start by solving a 1x2x3 block on the left hand side, followed by an identical block on the right side. Thereafter you permute and orient all remaining Last Layer corners using CMLL. From here, only M and U turns are made. The next step consists of orienting all remaining \"bad edges\". After orienting the \"bad edges\" you solve the two edges simultaneously which belong above the 1x2x3 blocks. The last, and shortest step is permuting the final 4 edges.Basic Rules  One of the most important things to do before you start learning any speedcubing method is to know how to solve your Rubik's Cube a beginner way. If you know this, you will understand that you cannot just get all of one color on one side, but you have to put the pieces in the right place as well. Knowing this will also help you to understand why many of the algorithms of a speedcubing method work. You also need to know the color scheme of your Cube by heart. To get a fast time, you must be able to know where pieces go relative to each other without having to think about it.Notation  The notation that will be used here is as follows:First 1x2x3  Creating a block one cube wide, two cubes tall, and three cubes deep, is the first step. This step is simple enough, and most anyone who can solve the Cube in a simpler fashion can finish this. This step is pretty self explanatory, and there are many ways to go about it, you just have to find them. This step can usually be mentally achieved by longtime Roux uses but in the fifteen second inspection time before any given scramble. This step is mostly completed mentally, so it is almost required that you have a basic understanding of your cube before getting decent times with this method. Most speedcubers find this the easiest step.Second 1x2x3  This step seems just as simple as the first, but many aspiring Roux users have difficulty procuring the fluidity which they might have in the first step. The main reason would be that you have to keep intact your first 1x2x3 block on the left side. This is a simpler task than many think, but you have to be resourceful and understand your Cube and its moves to imagine what needs to happen to complete this stepFixing Bad Edges  During this stage, you need the U or D face center on top. From there, proceed to see if any of the edge cubes have the F or B stickers on the U or D face. Once you locate all the pieces that un-oriented, you must orient them. This can be done with a little logic, and knowledge of your Cube. (For beginners, this concept may be difficult to grasp.) But you will get it.Placing L and R edges  All this step does is place two edges, simultaneously, above the 1x2x3 blocks from the first two steps. There are small amount of cases for this step, seeing that there are only 2 pieces you need to work with. This is can be highly optimized, and brought down to only a few moves.Permuting M edges  A fairly simple process, using any variation of M and only U2, that will correctly place the remaining 4 edges of the M slice, and also finish the Cube.Algorithms  Algorithms (algs for short) are a set of moves that are done in a specific order to achieve a specific end result in orienting or permuting the pieces on a Rubik's Cube. A special notation is used to describe which face needs to be rotated in which direction. A list of algorithm notations are listed below.Notations One face/layer - F, U, R, B, D, and L  F - Front face clockwise F' - Front face counter-clockwise U - Up face clockwise U' - Up face counter-clockwise R - Right face clockwise R' - Right face counter-clockwise B - Back face clockwise B' - Back face counter-clockwise D - Down face clockwise D' - Down face counter-clockwise L - Left face clockwise L' - Left face counter-clockwise F2 - Front face rotate 180\u00b0 U2 - Up face rotate 180\u00b0 R2 - Right face rotate 180\u00b0 B2 - Back face rotate 180\u00b0 D2 - Down face rotate 180\u00b0 L2 - Left face rotate 180\u00b0Two layers - w, f, u, r, b, d, and l  w/w' - Adds on to a letter (example: Fw) to indicate to turn two layers f - Front face double layer clockwise f' - Front face double layer counter-clockwise u - Up face double layer clockwise u' - Up face double layer counter-clockwise r - Right face double layer clockwise r' - Right face double layer counter-clockwise b - Back face double layer clockwise b' - Back face double layer counter-clockwise d - Down face double layer clockwise d' - Down face double layer counter-clockwise l - Left face double layer clockwise l' - Left face double layer counter-clockwise f2 - Front face double layer rotate 180\u00b0 u2 - Up face double layer rotate 360 degrees r2 - Right face double layer rotate 180\u00b0 b2 - Back face double layer rotate 180\u00b0 d2 - Down face double layer rotate 180\u00b0 l2 - Left face double layer rotate 180\u00b0Layer slices - M, E, and S  M - Turn the layer between L face and R face down (in the direction of an L move) M2- Turn the layer between L face and R face twice M' - Turn the layer between L face and R face up (in the direction of an R move) E - Turn the layer between U and D face counter-clockwise (in the direction of a D move) E' - Turn the layer between U and D face clockwise (in the direction of a U move) S - Turn the layer between the F and B face clockwise (in direction of an F move) S' - Turn the layer between the F and B face counter-clockwise (in direction of a B move)Entire cube orientation - x, y, and z  x - Turn the cube to R/L' direction x' - Turn the cube in direction of L/R' y - Turn the cube in direction of U y' - Turn the cube in direction of D/U' z - Turn the cube in direction of F z' - Turn the cube in direction of B/F'PLL  The PLL algorithms finishes the cube by permutating the last layer. All of the last layer pieces are moved to their proper locations. The red arrows show movements of the edge pieces, and the blue arrows show the movements of the corner pieces.Main Page Rubik's Revenge  The Rubik's Revenge, also known as the 4x4, is the sequel cube to the Rubik's Cube. The idea of the Rubik's Revenge is that it has more combinations and ways to solve, which also makes it harder. Although it has 16 pieces on each side, it is solved with a very similar method to the 3x3x3. The unicode character U+25A6 (\u25a6) resembles this cube.History  The Rubik's Revenge was patented by P\u00e9ter Sebest\u00e9ny on December 20th 1981. It was originally going to be named the P\u00e9ter Sebest\u00e9ny Cube, until a last minute change was made to attract fans of the original Rubik's Cube.Design  Since the Rubik's Revenge has 16 cubies on one side, it is built differently than the 3x3x3. Unlike a 3x3x3 Cube, the RR has 4 center cubies on each side, and 12 edge cubies. The 3x3x3 is built on a cross-like object, with the center pieces fixed into place and the edges interlocking with each other, but the RR is built on a spherical body. The sphere that the RR is built on has 8 pieces lifted approximately 0.25\" off of the sphere. The 8 pieces can be loosened or tightened with a screwdriver. The center cubies are snapped in where 4 pieces make one point. The edge cubies then interlock with the center pieces from 2 sides. The corner cubies fit between 2 sets of edge cubies. This design makes it harder to speedcube. To speedcube the RR, people make their own custom built Rubik's Cubes or buy higher quality 4x4x4's.Solving the Rubik's Revenge  The Rubik's Revenge can be solved with formulas very similar to the 3x3x3 cube. The only two problems are that unlike the 3x3x3 cube, this cube has the center cubie is split into 4 smaller cubies, and 12 edge pieces split into 2 smaller cubies each. To solve the cube, you must solve the center cubies, by making a 2x2 square on the center of each side of the cube, each representing the color of that side in its solved state. You must then solve the edge pairs by placing each color pair on one edge of the cube together. After solving those, you can solve the cube with any method used on the 3X3X3 cube. The final step is to fix what is called a parity. The 4x4x4 can have two possible problems not found on the 3x3x3. The first is two edge pieces reversed on one edge, resulting in the colors for that edge not matching the rest of the cubies on either face. The second is two edge pairs, known as dedges, being flipped with each other. Two more algorithms are required to fix these parities.World Records  The world record for fastest solve is 18.42 seconds, set by Max Park of the United States on 27 May 2018 at SacCubing IV 2018. The world record for fastest average of five solves (excluding fastest and slowest solves) is 21.13 seconds, also set by Park on 27 May 2018 at SacCubing IV 2018. The world record for fastest blindfolded solve (including inspection time) is 1 minute, 29.42 seconds, set by Stanley Chapel of the United States on 18 May 2018 at Great Lakes Championship 2018.Trivia Petrus Method  The Petrus method was invented by Lars Petrus. It consists on blockbuilding, first a 1x2x2 block, then a 2x2x2, then a 3x3x2, then fixing the mis-oriented (bad) edges, then finishing the first two layers, then permutation of the corners, followed by orientation of the corners and finally permutation of the edges. Each step is merged as much as possible to the following, for example, many people fix all the mis-oriented edges while finishing the 2x2x3 block.Algorithms Blockbuilding  Some Blockbuilding algorithms include the followingOrientation / Permution  Some algorithms are Niklas, Sune, Allen, Bert, and Arne.Mastermorphix  The Mastermorphix (sometimes misspelled \"Mastermorphinx\") is a tetrahedral shape mod of a 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube.Steps  Here is a small step by step guide, based off of the Petrus Method, that may help you:#1 - Build a \"cross\" #2 - Build the corner and 2 outer edges of 2 colors #3 - Build the last layer Tips Notation  Most 3\u00d73\u00d73 Rubik's Cube solution guides use the same notation, originated by David Singmaster, to communicate sequences of moves. This is generally referred to as \"Cube notation\" or in some literature \"Singmaster notation\" (or variations thereof). Its relative nature allows algorithms to be written in such a way that they can be applied regardless of which side is designated the top or how the colours are organized on a particular Cube.Standard 3\u00d73\u00d73 notation  All letters mean to turn that face a quarter-turn clockwise as seen when looking at that face. (For instance, F'B does the same thing as turning the slice behind F a quarter-turn clockwise, then the entire cube a quarter-turn anticlockwise about the F-B axis.) When a prime symbol ['] follows a letter, it means to turn the face counter-clockwise a quarter-turn, while a letter without a prime symbol means to turn it a quarter-turn clockwise. Such a symbol is pronounced prime. A letter followed by a 2 (occasionally superscript) or by a second [\"] means to turn the face a half-turn (the direction does not matter). Likewise, a number following a bracketed sequence means to do that sequence that number of times: for example, (F2 R2)3 = F2 R2 F2 R2 F2 R2, which does the two swaps UF-DF and UR-DR. Cycles (exchanges of two or more pieces) are denoted by listing the pieces exchanged in order, with the facets ordered according to where they end up; thus the cycle (UF-DF) (UR-DR) above means that the UF edge goes to the DF position, with the facet that was at U going to D while the facet in F remains in F, and likewise for the other swap. The cycle UL-UF-UR below means that the UL edge goes to UF (and remains upright), the UF edge to UR, and the UR edge to UL. These are sometimes called straight cycles to distinguish them from twisted cycles. If a cubie flips or rotates as the result of a cycle, this is called a twisted cycle; for instance, the monoflip used in some Cube solutions, which flips the UR edge and several other edges not in the U layer, is denoted as UR+ or UR-. A monotwist of the ULF corner clockwise (U goes to F, F goes to L, L goes to U) is ULF+; anticlockwise is ULF-. This notation can also be used on the Pocket Cube. To extend this notation to the 3x3x3x3, for the fourth axis the letters A and K (ana and kata) could be used.More advanced notation (slice moves, 4\u00d7 and 5\u00d7)  It can also be used on the Revenge and the Professor, with additional notation. They not only have the F, B, L, R, U, D notation but also f, b, l, r, u, d. For example: (Rr)' l2 f'. (A word of warning here. Some web pages use the lower-case letters to denote double-face turns, for instance f (on the 3\u00d73\u00d73) as the equivalent of B followed by a whole-Cube turn; or to denote whole-Cube turns. Be wary, and be sure to read any introduction the page offers.) Note that \"f\" means to turn only that slice while keeping the F face still. If a turn of both the front slices is required, that is denoted by Ff or by F (not to be confused with F which is the traditional way of writing F2). Multi-slice turns are denoted using the notation in the previous sentence; for example, U means to turn all three U layers of a 5\u00d75\u00d75 (or larger) cube. Sometimes the middle slices are used: And of course, M', E' and S' have the same meanings but for anticlockwise turns. This notation also allows identification of the third slice in on V6 and V7 cubes. Less often used moves include rotating the entire Cube or two-thirds of it. The letters x, y, and z are used to indicate that the entire Cube should be turned about one of its axes. (This type of move is used infrequently in most solutions, to the extent that some solutions simply say \"stop and turn the whole Cube upside-down\" or something similar at the appropriate point.) In speedcubing involving the 3\u00d73\u00d73, lowercase letters f, b, u, d, l, and r signify to move the first two layers of that face while keeping the remaining layer in place. This is of course equivalent to rotating the whole Cube in that direction, then rotating the opposite face back the same amount in the opposite direction, but is useful notation to describe certain triggers for speedcubing.Even more advanced notation  Sometimes, face \"slice moves\" are denoted: These can be distinguished from the slice moves in the previous section by the use of the lower-case \"s\" suffix (slice) as opposed to the upper-case S (Standing slice). There are also antislice moves: This kind of notation can also be used for the slice moves in the previous section: M=Sl, M'=Sr, E=Sd, E'=Su, S=Sf, S'=Sb. Finally, [P*Q] (P and Q can be any sequence of moves) is sometimes used to denote a conjugate (a sequence of the form P Q P'; P' meaning \"do the sequence backwards\", for instance, (R F2)'=F2 R'), and [P;Q] to denote a commutator (a sequence of the form P Q P' Q').Other notations  Some solution guides, including Ideal's official publication, The Ideal Solution, use slightly different conventions. Top and Bottom are used rather than Up and Down for the top and bottom faces, with Back being replaced by Posterior. + indicates clockwise rotation and - counterclockwise, with ++ representing a half-turn. However, alternative notations failed to catch on, and today the Singmaster scheme is used universally by those interested in the puzzle.Example  For example, the algorithm (or operator, or sequence) F U' R' L F R L' U' F, which cycles UL-UF-UR without affecting any other part of the Cube, means: For beginning students of the Cube, this notation can be daunting, and many solutions available online therefore incorporate animations that demonstrate the algorithms presented. For an example, see the video to the right, and this list of notations with pictures. 4\u00d74\u00d74 and larger Cubes use slightly different notation to incorporate the middle layers. Generally speaking, upper case letters (FBUDLR) refer to the outermost portions of the cube (called faces). Lower case letters (fbudlr) refer to the inner portions of the cube (called slices). Again Ideal breaks rank by describing their 4\u00d74\u00d74 solution in terms of layers (vertical slices that rotate about the Z-axis), tables (horizontal slices), and books (vertical slices that rotate about the X-axis).Notations for other puzzles Cuboids  Cuboids can use a version of cube notation. For sides where one of the dimensions is even and one is odd, they can only turn 180\u00b0, so a \"2\" is not needed and the letter alone can just be used.Pyraminx  With the official WCA pyraminx notation, the puzzle is held with a face facing you instead of a corner. There are 4 letters: Capital letters indicate deep turns, lowercase letters indicate the trivial tips. The prime symbol works the same way as on the cube. Double moves are not necessary as they are equivalent to prime moves. The same notation is used for the skewb. Hold the skewb with a corner pointing towards you.Megaminx  The official WCA scramble notation for the megaminx uses only 6 moves: Such a notation is only used for scrambling. In algorithms, a 3x3-like notation can be used for the top face and those adjacent to it. D is meaningless, but U, F, R and L can be used like on a 3x3. B needs to be split into BL (for the back face on the left) and BL (on the right). No prime or 2 means 72\u00b0 clockwise, a 2 means 144\u00b0, and a prime means counterclockwise. Each turn has 4 forms (U, U', U2, U2'). Any notation for the Megaminx also works with any puzzle with the same cuts but shallower or deeper.Square-1  The Square-1 uses a notation different from other twisty puzzles. (A,B), where A and B are numbers, means to turn the top face A increments of 30\u00b0 clockwise, and the bottom face B increments of 30\u00b0 clockwise (negative numbers mean to turn counterclockwise). A slash (/) means to turn the entire left half of the puzzle 180\u00b0. In the newer WCA notation, the slash symbol is absent and every set of numbers is followed by a slash move.Beginner's Method  The Rubik's Cube has six sides. Every side is labeled U, F, R, D, B, or L. When holding the cube with one corner pointing at you, the top side is called the U face. The side facing to the left is called the F face, and the side facing to the right is called the R face. Opposite to the R face is the L face, opposite to the U face is the D face, and opposite to the F face is the B face. F stands for front.\nU stands for up.\nR stands for right.\nB stands for back.\nD stands for down.\nL stands for left.\n\n There are variations of the Beginner's Method, but the one taught here should be the easiest to learn.Notation Algorithms  Solving the Rubik's Cube requires the knowledge of algorithms. The algorithms look something like \"\". Algorithms are a set of moves of rotating faces in a specific order. The letters show which face needs to be turned (clockwise by default) and the apostrophe means to turn the face the opposite way, or counter-clockwise. If a letter has a \"2\" after it, it means \"turn the face twice, or 180 degrees\". If no number is attached to the letter, it means \"turn the face a quarter turn, or 90 degrees\". Example: The algorithm \"\" means to do the following in this specific order:Individual Pieces  When referring to an individual piece on the Rubik's Cube, two or three letters are used. The URF piece means the piece that is located on the U face, R face, and F face. Examples are shown in the pictures below. Pieces labeled with only two letters are called an \"edge piece\". Pieces labeled with three letters are called a \"corner piece.\" All six sides of the Rubik's Cube have one center piece which never moves no matter what you do; white will always be opposite of yellow, red will always be opposite of orange, and blue will always be opposite of green.Step 1: The Cross Choose a side  The very first thing to do when solving the Rubik's Cube is to choose a side. Most people begin on the white side or the blue side because those two colors stand out the most. Another reason is that Rubik's Cube solvers are used to the adjacent colors. For this tutorial, we will begin on the white side.Look for the Cross edge pieces  There are only four cross edge pieces, all of which have two colors: white and other. On a standard Rubik's Cube, the \"other\" color would be red, green, orange, or blue.\n First, hold the cube so that the white center piece is on the U face. The yellow side should be on the bottom. The R, F, B, and L faces does not have to be any specific color.Cases  While solving the cross, you may encounter any of the following cases. The following pictures below will help you deal with them.Step 2: Solve three corners Purpose  We only need to solve three of the four corners on the U face. The last unsolved corner will be used to substitute in and out pieces to solve the rest of the cube. This unsolved corner piece on the white face will be referred to as the empty piece throughout this tutorial.Remember  Whenever trying to solve corners, if the corner piece is on the D face, rotate the D face until it is directly underneath where you want the corner piece to go on the U face.Step 3: Middle Layer Turn the cube  To solve the middle layer, you must turn the cube upside down so that the white face is now the D face, and the yellow face is the new U face. Middle layer pieces are edge pieces that should not have white or yellow on them. (The white should all already be solved from Step 1).Note  In this tutorial, the empty piece is the white-blue-red corner piece.Step 4: Upper Cross Two parts in this step  In this step, there are two parts. The first part is the solve the UF, UL, and UB edge pieces (when holding the cube with the empty edge and corner pieces in the BR and BRD positions respectively). The second step is to solve the BR and the UR edge pieces all with one algorithm.Step 5: Position Corner Pieces How this step works  In this step, we only need to place the corner pieces in their correct locations, not necessarily solve them. The corner pieces in the ULF place (shown by the blue arrow) and the DRB place will be switched when you use the one algorithm need on this step: L D2 L'. After you use that algorithm, the cube will be messed up, but after you turn the U face the necessary amount of times to get another corner piece to the ULF position and apply the L D2 L' algorithm again, you will have switched three corner pieces and fixed the cube.Step 6: Rotate Corner Pieces  After this step, you cube should be solved!Your cube should look something like this  Your Rubik's Cube is near complete, although you may have more incorrectly rotated corner pieces than what this picture shows. Just use the two algorithms provided in this step to fix the errors, so all we have to do now in this step is to rotate the corner pieces to solve the whole cube.\n The algorithms rotate the corner pieces by pairs, one clockwise and the other counter-clockwise, or one counter-clockwise and the other clockwise.Third case  Well now your cube should be solved. Congratulations!Vandenbergh-Harris Method  The Vandenbergh-Harris Method (also known as the VH method) was developed by Lars Vandenbergh and Dan Harris. This method is similar to the Fridrich method and Zborowski-Bruchem method. Using this method, the cross is solved first, then three pairs of the F2L are solved next. The final F2L pair is solved while orienting the last layer edges in two stages, the \"pair-up\" and the \"insert\". Next, the last layer corners are oriented and permutated simutaneously, while keeping the last layer edge orientation intact. There is a 1/12 chance that the cube will be solved after this step, if not, a permutation of the edges is needed as the final step.Rubik's Triamid  The Rubik's Triamid is a puzzle similar to the Rubik's Cube but is tetrahedron shaped with hexagonal pieces. The puzzle was invented by the same person who invented the Rubik's Cube Erno Rubik.Pieces  Each piece of the puzzle has four faces. Of the ten pieces: In the solved state, the four pieces with three colours must lie on the end points of the pyramid.Junior Cube  The Junior Cube is a 2x2x2 size cube, made to introduce young children to the world of Rubik's puzzles. It is also dubbed as a cube that \"anyone can solve\".The Junior Cube (JC) has 3 types of sides. The first side is all green, the second is pink with a picture of a monkey's head on it, and the other 4 sides are all pink.Design  The JC structure uses the exact same structure design as the Pocket Cube. The JC is built upon a structure made with 3 circles. The 3 circles are built with pieces of plastic. The pieces for the circles are split in half, with two sides to each piece of plastic, and a groove on the inside. All of the cubelets are corner pieces. The edges of the cubelets fit into the grooves.Solving the Junior Cube  The JC can be solved with layer by layer method. Most people solve the monkey first, and then try to put the Green and Pink corners in place to solve the bottom side.Trivia OLL Shortcuts  For some people, learning the OLL step of the Fridrich Method can be difficult. By learning a few shortcuts, there won't be any need to learn all 57 algorithms. You can use just one algorithm: .\n This algorithm can take most OLL cases and solve them. But do note that that means you will be slower then learning all algorithms.The Sequence  By just knowing the  algorithm, you can get these cases solved. In first case or fourth case if you do F R U Ri Ui, you can get cross.Professor Cube  The Professor Cube is a 5x5x5 Rubik's Cube variant. It has many similarities to the Rubik's Revenge, but is fundamentally different due to having odd-numbered dimensions. Like the standard Rubik's Cube, the centers maintain their location no matter how you turn it.Naming  Early versions of the 5\u00d75\u00d75 cube sold at Barnes & Noble were marketed under the name \"Professor's Cube\" but currently, Barnes and Noble sells cubes that are simply called \"5\u00d75.\" Mefferts.com offers a limited edition version of the 5\u00d75\u00d75 cube called the Professor Cube. This version has colored tiles rather than stickers.Workings  The original Professor Cube design by Udo Krell works by using an expanded 3\u00d73\u00d73 cube as a mantle with the center edge pieces and corners sticking out from the spherical center of identical mechanism to the 3\u00d73\u00d73 cube. All non-central pieces have extensions that fit into slots on the outer pieces of the 3\u00d73\u00d73, which keeps them from falling out of the cube while making a turn. The fixed centers have two sections (one visible, one hidden) which can turn independently. This feature is unique to the original design. The Eastsheen version of the puzzle uses a different mechanism. The fixed centers hold the centers next to the central edges in place, which in turn hold the outer edges. The non-central edges hold the corners in place, and the internal sections of the corner pieces do not reach the center of the cube. The V-Cube 5 mechanism, designed by Panagiotis Verdes, has elements in common with both. The corners reach to the center of the puzzle (like the original mechanism) and the center pieces hold the central edges in place (like the Eastsheen mechanism). The middle edges and center pieces adjacent to them make up the supporting frame and these have extensions which hold rest of the pieces together. This allows smooth and fast rotation and creating arguably the fastest and most durable version of the puzzle. Unlike the original 5\u00d75\u00d75 design, the V-Cube 5 mechanism was designed with speedcubing in mind.Durability  The original Professor Cube is inherently more delicate than the 3\u00d73\u00d73 Rubik's Cube because of the much greater number of moving parts. Because of the fragile design the Professor Cube is not suitable for speedcubing. Applying excessive force to the cube when twisting it may result in broken pieces. Both the Eastsheen 5\u00d75\u00d75 and the V-Cube 5 are designed with different mechanisms in an attempt to remedy the fragility of the original design.Permutations  There are 98 pieces on the exterior of the cube: 8 corners, 36 edges, and 54 centers (48 movable, 6 fixed). Any permutation of the corners is possible, including odd permutations, giving 8! possible arrangements. Seven of the corners can be independently rotated, and the orientation of the eighth depends on the other seven, giving 3 (or 2,187) combinations. There are 54 centers. Six of these (the center square of each face) are fixed in position. The rest consist of two sets of 24 centers. Within each set there are four centers of each color. Each set can be arranged in 24! different ways. Assuming that the four centers of each color in each set are indistinguishable, the number of permutations of each set is reduced to 24!/(24) arrangements, all of which are possible. The reducing factor comes about because there are 24 (4!) ways to arrange the four pieces of a given color. This is raised to the sixth power because there are six colors. The total number of permutations of all movable centers is the product of the permutations of the two sets, 24!/(24). The 24 outer edges cannot be flipped, since the interior shape of those pieces is asymmetrical. Corresponding outer edges are distinguishable, since the pieces are mirror images of each other. Any permutation of the outer edges is possible, including odd permutations, giving 24! arrangements. The 12 central edges can be flipped. Eleven can be flipped and arranged independently, giving 12!/2 \u00d7 2 or 12! \u00d7 2 possibilities (an odd permutation of the corners implies an odd permutation of the central edges, and vice versa, thus the division by 2). There are 24! \u00d7 12! \u00d7 2 possibilities for the inner and outer edges together. This gives a total number of permutations of The full number is precisely 282 870 942 277 741 856 536 180 333 107 150 328 293 127 731 985 672 134 721 536 000 000 000 000 000 possible permutations (about 283 duodecillion on the long scale or 283 tresvigintillion on the short scale). Some variations of the Professor Cube have one of the center pieces marked with a logo, which can be put into four different orientations. This increases the number of permutations by a factor of four to 1.13\u00d710, although any orientation of this piece could be regarded as correct. By comparison, the number of atoms in the observable universe is estimated at about 10. Other variations increase the difficulty by making the orientation of all center pieces visible. An example of this is shown below.Solution  People able to rapidly solve puzzles like this usually favour the reduction method of grouping similar edge pieces into solid strips, and centers into one-colored blocks. This allows the cube to be quickly solved with the same methods one would use for a 3\u00d73\u00d73 cube. As illustrated to the right, the fixed centers, middle edges and corners can be treated as equivalent to a 3\u00d73\u00d73 cube. As a result, once reduction is complete the parity errors sometimes seen on the 4\u00d74\u00d74 cannot occur on the 5\u00d75\u00d75, or any cube with an odd number of edges for that matter. Another frequently used strategy is to solve the edges of the cube first. The corners can be placed just as they are in any previous order of cube puzzle, and the centers are manipulated with an algorithm similar to the one used in the 4\u00d74\u00d74 cube. A less frequently used strategy is to solve one side and one rim first, then the 2nd, 3rd and 4th rim, and finally the last side and rim. That is, like building a building. First the basement, then each floor, and finally the roof.World records  The world record fastest 5\u00d75\u00d75 solve is 37.28 seconds, set by Max Park of the United States at 'SacCubing IV 2018'. The world record for average of five solves (excluding fastest and slowest) is 43.21 seconds, set by Feliks Zemdegs of Australia at the 'Melbourne Cube Days 2017' competition. The record for solving a 5\u00d75\u00d75 cube blindfolded is 3 minutes, 46.56 seconds (including inspection), set by Kaijun Lin (\u6797\u607a\u4fca) of China on 24 February 2018 at Singapore Championship 2018.Zborowski-Bruchem Method  The Zborowski-Bruchem Method (also known as the ZB method) was invented by Ron van Bruchem and Zbigniew Zborowski in 2003. After solving the cross and three F2L pairs, the final F2L pair is solved simutaneously with orienting the last layer edges. This is known as ZBLS. The final step in the Zborowski-Bruchem Method (known as ZBLL) involves orienting of corners, and permutation of corners and edges of the last layer. This method of solving the Rubik's Cube requires memorization of approximately 840 algorithms.Ern\u0151 Rubik  Ern\u0151 Rubik (known in his native Hungary as \"Rubik Ern\u0151\" \u2014 Hungarian custom is surname-first) was born in Budapest, Hungary during World War II. His mother was a poet, his father an aircraft engineer who started a company to build gliders. Rubik's initial attraction to inventing the Cube was not in producing the best selling toy puzzle in history. The structural design problem interested Rubik; he asked, \"How could the blocks move independently without falling apart?\" In Rubik's Cube, 26 individual little cubes or cubies make up the big Cube. Each layer of nine cubies can twist and the layers can overlap. Any three squares in a row, except diagonally, can join a new layer. Rubik's initial attempt to use elastic bands failed, his solution was to have the blocks hold themselves together by their shape. Rubik hand carved and assembled the little cubies together. He marked each side of the big Cube with adhesive paper of a different color, and started twisting. \"It was wonderful, to see how, after only a few turns, the colors became mixed, apparently in random fashion. It was tremendously satisfying to watch this color parade. Like after a nice walk when you have seen many lovely sights you decide to go home, after a while I decided it was time to go home, let us put the cubes back in order. And it was at that moment that I came face to face with the Big Challenge: What is the way home?\" \u2014 Ern\u0151 Rubik That was how the Cube as a puzzle, was invented in the spring of 1974, when the twenty-nine year old Rubik discovered it was not so easy to realign the colors to match on all 6 sides. He was not sure he would ever be able to return his invention to its original position. He theorized that by randomly twisting the Cube he would never be able to fix it in a lifetime, which later turned out to be more than correct. He began working out a solution, starting with aligning the eight corner cubies. He discovered certain sequences of moves for rearranging just a few cubies at a time. Within a month, he had the puzzle solved and an amazing journey lay ahead... Rubik applied for his Hungarian patent in January 1975 and left his invention with a small toy making cooperative in Budapest. The patent approval finally came in early 1977 and the first Cubes appeared at the end of 1977. By this time, Ern\u0151 Rubik was married. Two other people applied for similar patents at about the same time as Rubik. Terutoshi Ishige applied a year after Rubik, for a Japanese patent on a very similar cube. An American, Larry Nichols, patented a cube before Rubik, held together with magnets. Nichols' toy was rejected by all toy companies, including the Ideal Toy Corporation, which later bought the rights to Rubik's Cube. Sales of the Rubik's Cube were sluggish until Hungarian businessman Tibor Laczi discovered the Cube. While having a coffee, he spied a waiter playing with the toy. Laczi, an amateur mathematician, was impressed. The next day he went to the state trading company, Konsumex, and asked permission to sell the Cube in the West. \"When Rubik first walked into the room I felt like giving him some money,\" he says. \"He looked like a beggar. He was terribly dressed, and he had a cheap Hungarian cigarette hanging out of his mouth. But I knew I had a genius on my hands. I told him we could sell millions.\" \u2014 Tibor Laczi on meeting Ern\u0151 Rubik. Laczi proceeded to demonstrate the Cube at the Nuremberg toy fair, but not as an official exhibitor. Laczi walked around the fair playing with a Cube and managed to meet British toy expert Tom Kremer. Kremer thought Rubik's Cube was the wonder of the world. He later arranged an order for a million Cubes with Ideal Toy. Rubik's Cube was first called the Magic Cube (B\u0171v\u00f6s Kocka) in Hungary. The puzzle had not been patented internationally within a year of the original patent. Patent law then prevented the possibility of an international patent. Ideal Toy wanted at least a recognizable name to copyright; of course, that arrangement put Rubik in the spotlight because the Magic Cube was renamed after its inventor. Ern\u0151 Rubik became the first self-made millionaire from the communist bloc. The eighties and Rubik's Cube went well together. Cubic Rubes or Cubists (the name of cube fans) formed clubs to play and study solutions. A 16-year-old Vietnamese high school student from Los Angeles, Minh Thai won the world championship in Budapest (June 1982) by unscrambling a Cube in 22.95 seconds. The unofficial speed records may be ten seconds or less. Human experts now solve the puzzle in 24-28 moves on a regular basis. Ern\u0151 Rubik has established a foundation to help promising inventors in Hungary. He also runs the Rubik Studio, which employs a dozen people to design furniture and toys. Rubik has produced several other toys, including Rubik's Snake. He has plans to start designing computer games and continues to develop his theories on geometric structures. Seven Towns Ltd. currently holds the rights to Rubik's Cube. One of Ern\u0151's quotes is \"A good puzzle, it's a fair thing. Nobody is lying. It's very clear, and the problem depends just on you.\"Megaminx  The Megaminx is a dodecahedron-shaped puzzle with 12 faces. It was made at about the same time as the original Rubik's cube. The Megaminx may seem more difficult than the standard Rubik's Cube, but in fact it can be easier - due to the large number of sides, one turn will not disturb as many faces, and all but the final face can be solved with similar algorithm usage to the regular 3x3. A center-less Megaminx (similar to the Void Cube) is also manufactured under the name \"Holey Megaminx\" or the \"Void Megaminx\". In 1982 The Meffert Company made a puzzle that is a lot like the Megaminx, called the Pyraminx Crystal.Trivia Megaminx-Variations  There are many variations of this puzzle with the Megaminx at its core such as the \"Starminx II\" or the \"Kilominx\", as well as a variety of shape moifications such as the \"Hexaminx\" and \"Reuleaux-Minx\". Higher layered variations include the Gigaminx, which has two rotating layers on every face, the Teraminx, which has three and the Petaminx, which has four.Megaminx Records  The current record for the Megaminx single is a time of 37.58 by Yu Da-Hyun of South Korea. She also holds the average record for the Megaminx of 42.89 seconds.Pyraminx  The Pyraminx is a puzzle similar to the Rubik's Cube but in the shape of a tetrahedron. It was invented by Uwe Meffert in 1969 a few years before the original Rubik's cube was invented. At first he made it for a stress-management tool. You would spin it to calm yourself down. It is thus the forerunner of the fidget spinner. The Pyraminx has 933,120 possible permutations (positions) and the lowest possible number of moves you need to do to solve it is 11 moves. It is simpler than the normal Rubik's Cube, but spinning one side will affect three other sides, meaning that using algorithms is a must in order to maintain already solved sides. There is also the Tetraminx, which is just a Pyraminx with the corners removed. This of course does not affect the difficulty of the puzzle.Skewb Diamond  The Skewb Diamond is an octahedron-shaped puzzle similar to the Rubik's Cube. It has 14 movable pieces which can be rearranged in a total of 138,240 possible combinations. This puzzle is the dual polyhedron of the Skewb.Description  The Skewb Diamond has 6 square-pyramid corner pieces and 8 triangular face centers. All pieces can move relative to each other. It is a deep-cut puzzle: its planes of rotation bisect it. It is very closely related to the Skewb, and shares the same piece count and mechanism. However, the triangular \"corners\" present on the Skewb have no visible orientation on the Skewb Diamond, and the square \"centers\" gain a visible orientation on the Skewb Diamond. Combining pieces from the two can either give you an unsolvable cuboctahedron or a compound of cube and octahedron with visible orientation on all pieces. A 3-layer analog exists, called the \"Super Skewb Diamond\" or \"Face-Turning Octahedron\" (FTO for short). Its cubic equivalent is the Rex Cube.Number of Combinations  The puzzle has 6 corner pieces and 8 face centers. The positions of four of the face centers is completely determined by the positions of the other 4 face centers, and only even permutations of such positions are possible, so the number of arrangements of face centers is only 4!/2. Each face center has only a single orientation. Only even permutations of the corner pieces are possible, so the number of possible arrangements of corner pieces is 6!/2. Each corner has two possible orientations (it is not possible to change their orientation by 90\u00b0 without disassembling the puzzle), but the orientation of the last corner is determined by the other 5. Hence, the number of possible corner orientations is 2. The number of combinations is therefore (4!/2)(6!/2)(2)=(12)(360)(32)=138240.\u00a0That is a lot of combinations, although nowhere near the number of the Rubik's Cube, which has 4.3x10 combinations.Jessica Fridrich  Jessica Fridrich is one of the inventors of the most common speed cubing method, the Fridrich Method. She also came second in the World Champoinship 2003 and tenth in the World Championship 1982. Fascinated by puzzles and complex geometry, Fridrich has Rubik's Cube inventor\u00a0Ern\u0151 Rubik's signature in her notebook, which he signed at the Rubik's Cube World Championship in Budapest in 1982, where she finished tenth. In the second Rubik's Cube World Championship in Toronto, Canada, she finished second, behind Dan Knights. In the speedcubing community she is considered one of the pioneers of speedcubing, along with Lars Petrus. Nearly all of the fastest speedcubers have based their methods on Fridrich's, usually referred to as CFOP (Cross, First 2 Layers, Orient Last Layer, Permute Last Layer).Fridrich Method  \u2007\u2007\u2007\u2007\u2007Main Article: Fridrich Method This method describes solving the cube in a layer-by-layer fashion. First a so-called \"cross\" is made on the first layer, consisting of the center piece and four edges. The first layer corners and edges of the second layer are put into their correct positions simultaneously (four pairs). The last layer is solved by first orienting and then permuting the last layer cubies using a large number of algorithms.Speedcubing  Speedcubing is a term meaning the activity of solving a Rubik's Cube as fast as possible. Speedcubing can be associated with many types of cubes. Usually only cubes that turn well because if it does not turn well the cuber could not solve it fast and would get frustrated. Example for cubes that turn fast the Moyu cubes ganz puzzle and maby a speed Rubiks brand cube.External Links Cubes  There are many different shaped / sized / colored / textured puzzle-cubes similar to the standard 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube, but which provide entirely unique challenges. Note that this category is strictly for puzzles which are in the form of a cube when solved (such as the Mirror Cube) or which have a cubic mechanism (such as the Pyramorphix, which is a shape mod of a Pocket Cube). Puzzles which are neither of these. such as the Megaminx, do not belong here (the Megaminx should be in Category:Dodecahedra).Rubik's Tower  The Rubik's Tower is an irregularly-shaped Rubik's Cube variant. It is a 2x2x4 square prism, and can be thought of as two Pocket Cubes stacked on top of each other. It can be arranged into many odd shapes during solving. Its construction is complex and you're best off not disassembling it or else you may not be able to put it back together. This cube does not follow the standard Rubik's colour scheme but it has the Rubik's sticker on at the top.V-Cube 7  The V-Cube 7 is the 7\u00d77\u00d77 version of Rubik's Cube. It was invented by Panagiotis Verdes and is produced by his company, Verdes Innovations SA. Like the 5x5x5 , the V-Cube 7 has both fixed and movable center facets. The puzzle consists of 218 unique miniature cubes (\"cubies\") on the surface. Six of these (the central tiles of the six faces) are attached directly to the internal \"spider\" frame and are fixed in position relative to one another. The V-Cube 6 and V-Cube 8 uses essentially the same mechanism, except that on the latter the central rows, which hold the rest of the pieces together, are completely hidden.Mechanics  There are 150 center pieces which show one color each, 60 edge pieces which show two colors each, and eight corner pieces which show three colors each. Each piece (or quintet of edge pieces and 25-set(biquintet?)) shows a unique color combination, but not all combinations are present (for example, there is no edge piece with both red and orange sides, since red and orange are on opposite\u00a0sides of the solved Cube). The location of these cubes relative to one another can be altered by twisting the outer layers of the Cube 90\u00b0, 180\u00b0 or 270\u00b0, but the location of the colored sides relative to one another in the completed state of the puzzle cannot be altered: it is fixed by the relative positions of the fixed center squares and the distribution of color combinations on edge and corner pieces. Currently, the V-Cube 7 is produced with white plastic as a base, with red opposite orange, blue opposite green, and yellow opposite black. The fixed black center piece is branded with the letter V. Verdes also sells a version with black plastic and a white face, with the other colors remaining the same, solid plastic versions with the plastic the colour itself and no stickers, flag variations of 7x7s including Germany, Poland, Russia etc. Unlike the flat-sided V-Cube 6, the V-Cube 7 is noticeably rounded. This departure from a true cube shape is necessary, since a 7\u00d77\u00d77 would be impossible to construct with uniform pieces. Note from the image at right that if a 7\u00d77\u00d77 were to be constructed with layers of identical thickness the corner pieces (shown in red) would lose contact with the body of the cube when a side was rotated 45 degrees and fall out. The V-Cube 6 and V-Cube 7 both solve the problem by using thicker outer layers. The rounded shape of the V-Cube 7 helps disguise this.Permutations  Disassembled there are 8 corner cubes, 60 edges and 150 centers (6 fixed, 144 movable). Any permutation of the corners is possible, including odd permutations. Seven of the corners can be independently rotated, and the orientation of the eighth depends on the other seven, giving 8!\u00d73 combinations. There are 144 movable centers, consisting of six sets of 24 pieces each. Within each set there are four centers of each color. Centers from one set cannot be exchanged with those from another set. Each set can be arranged in 24! different ways. Assuming that the four centers of each color in each set are indistinguishable, the number of permutations of each set is reduced to 24!/(4!) arrangements, all of which are possible. The reducing factor comes about because there are 4! ways to arrange the four pieces of a given color. This is raised to the sixth power because there are six colors. The total number of permutations of all movable centers is the permutations of a single set raised to the sixth power, 24!/(4!). There are 60 edge pieces, consisting of 12 central, 24 intermediate, and 24 outer edges. The central edges can be flipped but the rest cannot (because the internal shape of the pieces is asymmetrical), nor can an edge from one set exchange places with one from another set. The five edges in each matching quintet are distinguishable, since corresponding non-central edges are mirror images of each other. There are 12!/2 ways to arrange the central edges, since an odd permutation of the corners implies an odd permutation of these pieces as well. There are 2 ways that they can be flipped, since the orientation of the twelfth edge depends on the preceding eleven. Any permutation of the intermediate and outer edges is possible, including odd permutations, giving 24! arrangements for each set or 24! total, regardless of the position or orientation any other pieces. The entire number is 19 500 551 183 731 307 835 329 126 754 019 748 794 904 992 692 043 434 567 152 132 912 323 232 706 135 469 180 065 278 712 755 853 360 682 328 551 719 137 311 299 993 600 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 (roughly 19,501 sexvigintillion or 19.5 sexvigintilliard on the long scale or 19.5 duoquinquagintillion on the short scale). However, the fixed black center piece is marked with a V, which can be oriented four different ways. This increases the number of patterns by a factor of four to 7.80\u00d710, although any orientation of this piece could be regarded as correct.Solution  One strategy involves grouping similar edge pieces into solid strips, and centers into one-colored blocks. This allows the cube to be quickly solved with the same methods one would use for a 3\u00d73\u00d73 cube. Because the permutations of the corners, central edges and fixed centers have the same parity restrictions as the 3\u00d73\u00d73 cube, the parity errors seen on the 4\u00d74\u00d74 and 6\u00d76\u00d76 cannot occur on the 7\u00d77\u00d77 unless the cube has been tampered with. Another strategy is to solve the edges of the cube first. The corners can be placed just as they are in any previous order of cube puzzle, and the centers are manipulated with an algorithm similar to the one used in the 4\u00d74\u00d74 cube.Records for the 7x7x7 cube  The world record time for a single solve is 1 minute, 57.76 seconds, set by Kevin Hays of the United States on 9 June 2018 at Rose City 2018 in Portland, Oregon. The world record mean of three solves is held by Max Park of the United States with a time of 2 minutes, 4.32 seconds, set on 14 April 2018 at Cerritos Open 2018 in Artesia, California.Sources ", "\u0423\u0431\u0435\u0436\u0438\u0449\u0435": "\u0423\u0431\u0435\u0436\u0438\u0449\u0435 ", "Faer\u00fbnpedia": "Faer\u00fbnpedia ", "\u042d\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0434\u0438\u044f StarCraft": "\u042d\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0434\u0438\u044f StarCraft List of StarCraft II units  The following is a complete unit list for StarCraft II multiplayer game units to date. StarCraft II was announced on May 19, 2007. The unit list has undergone numerous changes since then. StarCraft II was released as a trilogy. With each installment, more units were released in a manner similar to the additional units added in StarCraft: Brood War. The first StarCraft II product, Wings of Liberty, was released on July 27, 2010. Units added in Heart of the Swarm and Legacy of the Void have been sub-divided from the base unit list. All three races are available in the Versus mode of StarCraft II.Terran Wings of Liberty Add-Ons  In StarCraft II, terran add-ons, the reactor and the tech lab, work differently. Instead of being specific to an associated structure, each add-on can be added to any barracks, factory or starport, granting a specific benefit. One structure may only have one add-on attached to it, so it cannot benefit from the reactor's bonus and the tech lab's bonus simultaneously.Campaign and Co-op Missions Units  StarCraft II has a number of campaign-specific units. Many can be controlled by the player.Scrapped and Unused Units  Some units that were cut in development will appear in the map editor and campaign. However, units that were completely cut did not appear in either.Trivia StarCraft Wiki Welcome to the StarCraft Wiki StarCraft II  StarCraft II is a sequel to the real-time strategy game StarCraft, announced on May 19, 2007, at the Blizzard World Wide Invitational in Seoul, South Korea. It is set to be released as a trilogy. StarCraft II is free to play; multiplayer and the Wings of Liberty campaign are free, and all Co-op Commanders free until level 5. Internet access is not required to play the game but is required for installation.StarCraft II is available through digital distribution. StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty sold 1.5 million copies in its first two days and 3 million copies in its first month. It was the best-selling game of July 2010. Blizzard intends to continue support StarCraft II years after release, in a similar manner to the StarCraft patches, which have been updated more than ten years after the release of the original StarCraft. As of 2011, there are no plans to port StarCraft II to any console platform.Overview  The game is split into three separate self-contained installment products. Blizzard Entertainment chose this route due to the challenges they faced creating the campaigns. Through a trilogy, they can create more content per campaign, such as movies, sets, props, characters, missions (including Easter egg missions) and so forth. Each character has their own arcs, missions and dialog. The story has been designed so that no previous knowledge of StarCraft is required to enjoy it. In-universe the campaigns occur in sequence, each campaign beginning immediately after its predecessor. Each campaign has 26-30 missions in total (including branching missions) and a set ending, rather than a cliff-hanger. All three races were completely developed for the multiplayer skirmish mode.Expansions  Heart of the Swarm and Legacy of the Void are considered to be expansion sets and are priced as such. Rob Pardo later described them as expansions from a multiplayer standpoint (much like Brood War) but sequels from a campaign standpoint. As of the announcement of the release date of Heart of the Swarm, the cost of the first expansion is $40 USD for the standard edition, and $55 USD for the deluxe edition. Each upgrades and expand multiplayer content in addition to containing a campaign, such as the possibility of new units, abilities and structures. New units available in the expansions can only be accessed if a player buys the expansion. Each product has upgrades to the multiplayer, \"that's the whole point of the expansion or the second part\". Each race has been enhanced in some way.Mission Packs  It was stated that StarCraft II would continue to receive downloadable campaign content post-Legacy of the Void in the form of \"mission packs\". The first of these, Nova Covert Ops, is a series of 9 missions released over a trio of installments. The first three missions were released on March 29, 2016, and the second three on August 2nd, 2016.\n After the release of the final part of the mission pack, fan reaction will be gauged to determine whether more mission packs will be released, or whether Blizzard should work on a new RTS game. At Gamescon 2016, Blizzard stated that they have no plans for additional mission packs moving into 2017. As of BlizzCon 2016, they are not working on any more mission packs. The reason for the shift was that there were observable spikes in Co-op Missions and Versus in terms of player engagement, hence the shift to cultivate these modes. Blizzard is not currently working on any new campaigns (as of BlizzCon 2017).Storyline Story and Lore  The trilogy takes place four years after StarCraft: Brood War. The storyline was written by Chris Metzen and Andy Chambers, concurrently with The Dark Templar Saga which was written by Christie Golden. Each of the three campaigns \u2013 terran (Wings of Liberty), zerg (Heart of the Swarm) and protoss (Legacy of the Void) \u2013 has been released as separate products. The trilogy has an overall arc of escalation, beginning small with Wings of Liberty (rebellion against the Dominion), escalating to Heart of the Swarm (where Kerrigan commands the fate of an entire race) and culminating in Legacy of the Void, in the final battle of the Protoss against Amon. StarCraft II takes place both on new worlds and on worlds that appeared in the original game. Char is back as is Mar Sara. One of the new worlds is Bel'Shir, a jungle-covered protoss-colonized moon that was a religious retreat until it was attacked by the zerg; it now houses many ruined temples. Other new worlds include Redstone III and Monlyth. Jim Raynor continues his adventures along with Kerrigan, Zeratul and Artanis. The campaign can be played without an internet connection, although Blizzard prefers that it be played online (to enable achievements and special save game features).Precursor Events Mythology  An overarching thread involving the xel'naga and rumors of hybrid creatures weaves through the campaigns. There are many connections between the StarCraft: Ghost franchise and StarCraft II. For instance, Gabriel Tosh, a character from StarCraft: Ghost Academy, appears on the Hyperion in Wings of Liberty and serves as a connection between the two storylines. The StarCraft: Ghost storyline, especially parts revolving around the Terran Dominion, acted as a building block for StarCraft II.Other Races  The xel'naga fits into the story \"in a rather epic tale\" and form part of the backbone of the trilogy.Units  StarCraft II only features the three original races in standard multiplayer: protoss, terran, and zerg. It has been confirmed that there would not been a fourth race introduced. Some units have animations such as air banking, starting and stopping. StarCraft II retains some units from the original game, although some of these units have been given new abilities. Due to story events from the previous game, some units have been phased out or replaced. For example, the conquest of the protoss homeworld of Aiur has prevented the creation of more dragoons \u2013 the transplanted forms of protoss warriors in exoskeletons \u2013 resulting in the remaining dragoons to be redesigned with different weaponry and a shield that absorbs heavy damage and renamed to \"immortals\". The number of units in the game did not significantly change from Brood War. For every new unit added, one \"underused\" unit has been removed.Gameplay  The StarCraft II experience places emphasis on three playable races locked in a cinematic intra-galactic warfare through an epic story Campaign, best-in-class multiplayer Versus competition, and collaborative Co-op Missions.[1] There are six levels of AI script difficulty: very easy, easy, medium, hard, very hard and insane. The insane AI mode is the only one which \"cheats\". StarCraft II features 20 unique tilesets, including the Shattered City environment.Customs  Custom games allow \"handicaps\" for different players. This is set before the match. Custom games give players the ability to play against chosen players or AI on the maps of their choosing. These custom maps allow players to set map type, game speed, AI difficulty and expansion level. AI can be customized to favor different builds and strategies. Mods may be added to these custom maps to change the game experience while still giving the player the ability to play on different maps.Collections  Collections allow players to customize their battle.net profile and race's army. From here, players can change their unit's skins, their consoles, announcers, portraits, decals and sprays. This menu also gives players the option to see what emoticons and /dance animations they have unlocked. For 3v3 and 4v4 games, only four skins can be set per race. This can be set in the \"Large Format Games\" box.Replays  Replays are available in StarCraft II as well, for both singleplayer and multiplayer games. Multiplayer games include menus, leaderboards and overlays displaying statistics. StarCraft II features seven observer modes: These are available in \"real time\". In Observer Mode, a viewer can watch in the \"old style\" or in a newer \"first person view\" in which they see the camera view, selections and commands issued from the player's viewpoint. An observer won't be able to see the actual mouse clicks, however. At the end of the game, build orders, an army graph showing the size of the army over time and a resource graph showing income over time can be displayed.Battle.net  Blizzard Entertainment released a new version of battle.net with StarCraft II.Metagame Functionality  Frank Pearce said they wouldn't be able to implement all plans by the time StarCraft II launches, but they can add more features to battle.net \"as we go\". StarCraft II does not have LAN support. Internet access is not be required to play the game but is required for installation. Blizzard expects requiring internet access for some features to not be a problem, since computers come standard with internet connections now (unlike when StarCraft came out). Players of StarCraft II and Diablo III share \"gamer achievements\", adding up to a Blizzard Level, in a similar manner to the system in World of Warcraft. While achievements can be accessed in the single-player game, this is only possible if the gamer is connected to battle.net. Players does not require internet access to play single-player games, but they are encouraged to do so. The game did not launch with the ability to display replays to multiple users.Teaching the Game  Blizzard intends to train new players for the multiplayer game, eventually transforming casual gamers into hardcore gamers. The campaign does not act as a tutorial for teaching game mechanics. Instead, the game includes pre-recorded tutorials which players can watch, as well as \"challenges\", small missions which train players in specific tasks suited for multi-players games such as efficient resource gathering. A challenge would last 5-10 minutes and the player would get a score. Challenges cover topics important to multiplayer, such as resourcing, hotkeys and counters. In addition, players receives help on why they won or lost a game. There are tutorials for protoss and zerg which players can view before playing them on battle.net. Blizzard expected players who start on Battle.net to play cooperatively vs the AI, then move into team play before finally graduating to 1 vs 1. Blizzard considers team play less hectic, as the teammates can support each other. Achievements are used to direct players along this path. Blizzard expects players to play 30-60 hours of the game before they begin playing 1 vs 1. By 2012 Blizzard changed its training techniques. As of patch 2.0.4 StarCraft II comes with a training mode. The training mode shows four windows going left to right\u2014Training, Versus A.I., Unranked, and Ranked. Each race has three training missions. For each there are three stages. The player is given simple goals against an AI opponent. Stage 1 goes at normal speed and gives ground units. Stage 2 gives more advanced ground units and increases the game speed to fast. At stage 3, all units are available and the speed is set to faster. The player can then play against the AI either singly or in groups. A matchmaking vs AI system has been introduced, where players matches against an AI level that matches their skills. This is called the AI Challenge Mode. This is determined by three placement matches. Next is Unranked Play, which do not affect a player's ladder ranking. Matchmaking is still be used to pair off players. The game uses the ranked ladder rating if the player already has one, but it begins to diverge at this point. Finally there is the traditional Ranked Play. This gives access to the ladder and leagues.MLG Leagues  Leagues are part of the tool system making multiplayer StarCraft II available for all skill levels, along with the automated matchmaking system. There are copper, bronze, silver, gold, platinum and diamond leagues. There is also a \"safer\" Practice League, which would involve players of lower skill levels playing on maps designed to prevent rushing at \"normal\" rather than a faster game speed. Blizzard intends to take steps to prevent \"smurfing\", when higher-skilled players participate in battle.net games they shouldn't be and disrupt other players.Media  StarCraft II features new soundtracks by Glenn Stafford, the soundtrack composer for StarCraft. In addition, edited versions of the StarCraft soundtracks are found in StarCraft II. The trilogy's lore lore is supported by several novels authorized by Blizzard Entertainment. The Dark Templar Saga serves as a prologue to StarCraft II,I, Mengsk is a tie-in to StarCraft II and the StarCraft: Ghost novel Spectres also served as a tie-in.StarCraft: Ghost in StarCraft II  Nova and Gabriel Tosh, the latter introduced in the Ghost Academy graphic novel series, feature in a subset of missions centered around spectres. Tosh hires Jim Raynor to collect jorium and terrazine to assist in the production of spectres, and the player may ultimately either side with Tosh and break Tosh's fellow spectres out of New Folsom Prison, or side with Nova to kill Tosh and destroy his spectre production facilities. The player receives the ability to use either spectres or ghosts depending on who they side with. Horace Warfield also factors prominently into the later stages of the campaign, being the general accompanying Valerian Mengsk. However, there is no mention of his connection to Nova or spectres. A Nova-centered cinematic appears on a TV screen in StarCraft II. Certain assets from StarCraft: Ghost, such as interior installation art, appear in StarCraft II.Technologies  StarCraft II supports the DirectX 9 (Pixel Shader 2.0) software. It is fully compatible with DirectX 10 as well, which provides access to enhanced graphical effects. The game is also compatible with DirectX 11, but it don't support features specific to it. The Mac client utilizes OpenGL, instead. The game also features the Havok physics engine, allowing realistic interaction with the environment, such as \"debris roll(ing) down a ramp\". The game supports a variety of video cards; old cards like ATI Radeon 9800/NVIDIA GeForce FX to ATI Radeon HD 4800s and NVIDIA GeForce G200s are also supported. StarCraft II supports screen resolutions from 5:4 to 16:9. Wider screens has a slightly larger viewable range. The game supports wide screens but not multiple monitors. The minimum resolution is 1024 x 768 x 32 bits. StarCraft II supports a windowed mode. Game unit models feature about 2000 polygons. During game design, 3DSMax was used to create low-polygon unit models, MudBox for high-polygon models, and Photoshop was used to edit textures. Gore can be disabled, but doing so requires restarting the game. StarCraft II is written in 32-bit code but supports 64-bit systems. It has multi-core capability. The game supports lighting effects, including a light/dark cycle used in some missions. Voice chat is enabled over battle.net, but the audio is not available in replays.Galaxy Map Editor  The game comes with a map editor. The StarCraft II Map Editor improves upon the World Editor from Warcraft III in every way. Blizzard supports the modding community with theirs Arcade program. There are plans to allow to sell some mods the future.Startools  Startools, a proprietary toolset, is included with Galaxy Map Editor. Startools lets modders design and create doodads.Development Conception  Development on the game began shortly after Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne in July 2003. The game entered full production c. 2004, codenamed \"Medusa.\" The development was ramped up shortly after the production of World of Warcraft which was when Blizzard Entertainment hired Dustin Browder: March 14th, 2005 to the position of senior designer. He later became the lead designer. The conception was for a re-imagining of the original game, having more units but staying true to its spirit. However, the developers didn't want each race's unit count to get too big. It was decided that if a unit was brought back from the original, another unit would have to be cut. Blizzard designed the races around \"cool units,\" rather than having specific plans for the races. The developers knew they had to create new units and buildings, as well as provide new gameplay approaches for each race, but also stay true to the setting's core mechanics. The game was designed specifically around competitive, skill-based e-sports. Blizzard discussed the possibility of a fourth race early on in the game's development. However, the development team felt that had a finite amount of ideas and wanted to make sure that they focused on the best ideas for the existing three playable races rather than diluting those ideas across four races. Over development, the idea of bringing in a fourth race made \"less and less sense.\" It has been indicated that the United Earth Directorate was considered for \"fourth power\" status within the game's framework. In August 2008, Frank Pearce stated that adding a fourth fully playable race would likely be discussed if Blizzard decided to make an expansion for the game, three months before the expansions were announced.Subsequent Development  When development on the game began, artwork from the original StarCraft was looked at. However, very little source art from the original was preserved. The artists were given free reign to iterate on the original designs. The game was updated approximately once a week during development. Addressing rumors, Karune stated that StarCraft II was intended to be released before Diablo III. Blizzard made the very first publicly playable demo of StarCraft II available at BlizzCon 2007. StarCraft II was featured at E3 2007, July 11th 2007. Only a demo was viewable, not a playable version. StarCraft II was featured at BlizzCon 2007, August 3rd to 4th, 2007. Terrans and Protoss were playable. The same two races were playable at GenCon Indy. The game was available at the 2007 Games Convention in Leipzig, Germany, August 22nd to 26th 2007. The game was still in internal alpha/pre-alpha in August, 2008. Two weeks before BlizzCon 2008, the entire company played StarCraft II, an important milestone. The exposition match played at BlizzCon 2008 was referred to as an \"alpha\" version but also a \"pre-alpha\" version and in Battle Report II it was referred to as an alpha version. Mike Morhaime expected the game to launch by the end of 2009 but this has been delayed to at least 2010 to give adequate time to prepare Battle.net.Approaching Beta  A StarCraft II beta key was released at BlizzCon 2008. In February 2009 Blizzard COO Chris Sams said the beta was \"months away\". That same month Dustin Browder addressed criticisms that the beta was taking too long to announce, saying they Blizzard still needed to do work on the campaign and on battle.net, and that the beta would be announced when they had an idea what the release date would be. He also believed the beta would be announced in 2009. In August 2009 Blizzard announced that StarCraft II would not be released in 2009, and would instead be released in the first half of 2010. The StarCraft II beta was announced in February 2010 and released on the 17th of that month. The beta closed on July 19th. It had a day one patch. As of August 2011 the \"Starter Edition\" became available. This gives access to the first three missions of Wings of Liberty plus either The Evacuation or Smash and Grab (player's choice), the first two challenges: Tactical Command and Covert Ops, access to terrans in Single-Player vs AI and Custom Games in the following maps: Discord IV, High Orbit, The Shattered Temple, Xel'Naga Caverns and the custom map StarJeweled, subject to change over time. Achievements and campaign progress are saved in case the player upgrades to the full version of Wings of Liberty or any other chapter.Free to Play Model  StarCraft II adopted a free to play model in November, 2017. It was anticipated that players new to the game would start with the campaign, then transition to Co-op Missions, then transition to Versus (under the premise that each transition would give the player a rise in difficulty). Analysis by Blizzard showed that this wasn't the case though, and there was no overall pattern of player preference as far as transitions went.Storyline  The generalities of the overall story were present before the decision was made to extend it over a trilogy. The trilogy's arc was designed by Chris Metzen, James Waugh, and Jason Huck. The larger points were agreed on and were given to the design team. One of the aspirations was the game was to do something different from StarCraft I, namely the briefing screen format. Metzen pushed for the game to be a \"living\" one. That the storyline was split over three games was a result of the sprawling narrative that was envisioned. The United Earth Directorate was originally going to play a significant role in the game, where the conflict between the terrans, zerg, and protoss, would spiral back to Earth, where the zerg would invade. But as the campaign developed, a number of things shifted, and this plan got scaled back. Furthermore, it was found that the conflict between the Terran Dominion and Raynor's Raiders was sufficient to define Wings of Liberty, without the need to bring in the UED.Developers  The lead designer for StarCraft II was Dustin Browder. The team devoted to StarCraft II consisted of only about 40 developers in 2008, including twelve people who worked on the original StarCraft. As of 2008, the team consisted of four or five managers, 12-14 programmers, 8-10 artists and the rest consist of designers. It has its own internal leadership structure. A \"couple\" of ex-progamers are part of the team, working on balance issues such as mutalisk micromanagement and creating strategies against each other. By June 2009 the team had expanded to about 50 members and by August it had expanded to 60 members. As of September 2009 StarCraft II has 58 unique voice actors. Some play more than one role.Regional Differences  As of July 18, 2011, six regions were merged into three: North and Latin America, Taiwan and Korea, and Russia and Europe. StarCraft II has both download and subscription models in Russia, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil and Chile. Players can either download the entire version of the game, or pay a reduced price (about half), which offers gameplay for 60 days. Players could then pay another fee for more gameplay. South Korean gamers are be able to play three versions of the game. The full game can be purchased for 69,000 won, but a monthly and daily pass version of the game are available (the game would be unlocked with purchased passes). South Korean players who own a World of Warcraft account can play StarCraft II for free without purchasing passes. Players can play at PC baangs for a low price. In China, StarCraft II's open beta started on March 29, 2011 for free. Chinese StarCraft II players pays 20 yuan (approximately $3) per month.Trailers, Demonstrations & Other Videos Official Videos  The official videos featured Blizzard Entertainment employees making official announcements. Most are stored on the official website for StarCraft II, established and maintained by Blizzard Entertainment.WWI 2007 Videos BlizzCon 2007 Videos  Blizzard Entertainment showcased several videos at BlizzCon 2007.March 2008 Videos  Blizzard Entertainment held a press event in March 2008 to showcase the zerg.WWI 2008  Blizzard Entertainment hosted the World Wide Invitational in June 28 to 29, 2008. Live streaming video of panels and games were shown.BlizzCon 2008  At BlizzCon 2008, Blizzard showed several videos, including the first minutes of the StarCraft II cinematic, The Prophecy. At the time, it may have been the game's opening cinematic.Commercials Ghosts of the Past Trivia  According to a poll conducted by Blizzard, StarCraft II players' primary interest in the game can be broken down as follows (as of January 2017):External links StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm  Heart of the Swarm is the name of the StarCraft II zerg campaign and episode. It is released separately from the other two games and was priced as an expansion. The basic set costs $40 USD and the deluxe set costs $55 to $60. The Collector's Edition costs $80. It has been collected into a battlechest alongside Wings of Liberty. On July 15 2015, Heart of the Swarm was made a standalone title, allowing play without having first purchased Wings of Liberty. After StarCraft II becomes free to play, Heart of the Swarm will be free for anyone who purchased Wings of Liberty prior to the F2P model. It follows Wings of Liberty and precedes Legacy of the Void chronologically and storywise. The game is so named as per it being the most in-depth look into the zerg that Blizzard has ever carried out, allowing players to look into the 'heart' of the Swarm.Description  The Queen of Blades is gone. On the hellish planet Char, Jim Raynor harnessed the power of an ancient Xel\u2019Naga artifact in a desperate bid to stop the zerg Swarm from overrunning the Koprulu sector, and the relic restored Sarah Kerrigan to her human form. Without their queen to guide and unify them, the Swarm has fractured into several broods scattered throughout the Koprulu sector. One of the greatest threats to the galaxy has been neutralized...or so it seems. Sarah Kerrigan is on the loose. Even without the terrible powers of the Queen of Blades or the might of the Swarm at her command, the former Ghost remains a foe not to be taken lightly. But if the artifact really did set her free, then why is Kerrigan seeking out zerg broods scattered throughout the Koprulu sector? What happened to Jim Raynor? Is she still pursuing her quest for vengeance, or has her transformation given Kerrigan a new purpose? Who is Sarah Kerrigan?Storyline  Heart of the Swarm is a sequel to Wings of Liberty. It focuses on Sarah Kerrigan and the development of a zerg empire. Kerrigan is no longer considered the Queen of Blades. Questions remain about why Kerrigan is no longer with Jim Raynor and whether her transformation has given her new purpose. It begins three weeks after the end of Wings of Liberty. Kerrigan is treated as an anti-hero storywise, and will have to make peace with her relationship with the Swarm over the course of the story. Themes of identity and responsibility will be present, of how responsible Kerrigan is for her actions and whether there are some crimes that can't be forgiven. She is torn in a sense, with her love for Raynor pulling her in one direction, and her hatred for Mengsk pulling her in another.Summary  Following the Dominion victory on Char, the Zerg Swarm was scattered, and Kerrigan was transformed into a human form but still has some infested elements (such as her zerg \"dreadlocks\"), and whether she had her original personality back. Kerrigan was taken by Jim Raynor and Valerian Mengsk to a Umojan Protectorate lab in order to escape the pursuit of Arcturus Mengsk, who wanted her dead. Valerian and the Umojan scientists experimented on her control of the zerg swarm, which angered Kerrigan, and she sent zerglings against the robotic defenses of the lab. Valerian later let her go, but a Terran Dominion force under Nova stormed the facility to capture Kerrigan. Kerrigan escaped, but Jim Raynor was captured. Kerrigan went to the rendezvous site to find Jim, but found only a Dominion force that had set up a Drakken pulse cannon. She reclaimed the Naktul Brood in the region, and destroyed the Dominion forces, but Jim was nowhere to be found. She tuned into a UNN broadcast reporting that Jim Raynor had been killed, which set her on the path of revenge against Mengsk. Kerrigan boarded a zerg Leviathan, and took control of the broods there. She found Abathur and Izsha aboard it, who had served as her assistants when she was the Queen of Blades. Kerrigan sought to regain the broods of the rogue broodmother Nafash on the planet Kaldir. When she arrived, she found the brood feral and scattered, and that the protoss colonists there had slew Nafash. They tried to contact Shakuras to bring their fleets against her, but she destroyed their psi-link spires and ark shuttles before they could contact the Golden Armada. The colonists then attempted to escape on the Daelaam Ark, but using a larva implanted in the protoss Lasarra, Kerrigan spawned a broodmother on the shuttle. All protoss on board the ship were killed before they could contact Shakuras. Kerrigan set her broods to reclaim the planet Char, which was under the control of the Terran Dominion under General Warfield. She first fought against the rogue Broodmother Zagara, who did not recognize Kerrigan's authority as the leader of the swarm. Kerrigan spared her, and began having Abathur manipulate her to make her more powerful. She then broke through Warfield's Bone Trench, and assaulted his base.  The Dominion on Char were broken, and Kerrigan killed Warfield. However, his last condemning words gave Kerrigan a moment of mercy, and she allowed the wounded Dominion forces to escape. In the aftermath, the Leviathan was boarded by Prelate Zeratul. Kerrigan was initially hostile to Zeratul, but he granted her a vision of Zerus, the zerg homeworld, and that the prophecy demanded that she be remade there as a primal zerg. Kerrigan was hesitant, but acted on the prophecy, and moved on Zerus, wanting the power to get revenge on Mengsk. She battled the pack leaders of the planet, and awakened Zurvan, the most ancient primal zerg on the planet. Zurvan told her of the first spawning pool, where she could be reborn as primal zerg. Kerrigan did this, leaving her assistants to defend her. After battling the pack leaders, Kerrigan was reborn with more power than she ever had as the Queen of Blades. A primal zerg named Dehaka saw her power, and offered his allegiance, but the other primals gathered their packs to challenge her. Kerrigan used her new power to defeat all of the pack leaders, including Zurvan himself, and gathered the primal zerg under her control. Kerrigan was then contacted by Mengsk, who told her Raynor was alive and if she attacked the Dominion he would kill her. Kerrigan could not sense Raynor, but swore to find him. She contacted Matt Horner and Valerian Mengsk, who knew only Colonel Orlan could get through the Dominions deep-encryption network to find Jim Raynor. The group met with Mira Han who had him in custody, but refused to give him up. Matt Horner lead the Hyperion against Mira Han, and destroyed her fortress, getting Orlan back. Orlan found Jim Raynor on the Moros, a secure Dominion prison vessel. Kerrigan raided the vessel and found Jim. Sadly, he believed that she had re-infested herself as he left the ship. The Swarm got a psionic message from an infested terran named Alexei Stukov, who told Kerrigan of the Dominion Hybrid Breeding Program on Skygeirr Platform. Kerrigan agreed to help Stukov, and boarded the platform, infesting the marines guarding it. She broke into the facility, discovering the ancient xel'naga Narud in the guise of a Moebius Foundation terran. Kerrigan destroyed the Hybrid dominators he sent to assault her, and pushed further into the xel'naga ruins the base was built on. The swarm engaged the Tal'darim guarding the inner ruins, and Kerrigan engaged with Narud in single combat. Stukov set about commanding the swarm to deactivate the xel'naga shrines powering Narud, allowing Kerrigan to push his null zone back at him. He was wounded, but not killed. Kerrigan then pursued Narud into the ruins, where he took the guise of Jim Raynor, then her in her uninfested form. After a close battle, Kerrigan slew Narud, but he told her of the fallen xel'naga Amon and his return. She was rescued by Zagara, who commanded the swarm while she recovered. Kerrigan swore that after she killed Mengsk, she would face Amon. Kerrigan then began her final assault on Korhal to kill Mengsk, bringing her broods in for the final battle. Valerian told Kerrigan to set her brood down outside the city so he could evacuate the civilian population, to which Kerrigan reluctantly agreed. Korhal's orbital defenses were heavy, and destroyed millions of zerg upon entry. Kerrigan engineered bile launchers that were able to destroy Korhal's defense network. As they closed on the capitol, Mengsk unleashed the psi destroyer, a platform that could destroy any zerg connected to the hive mind. Dehaka lead the primal zerg unconnected to the hive mind to destroy the power generators on the platform, allowing Kerrigan to destroy the weapon. In the final assault, Mengsk sent his elite guard against Kerrigan. Jim Raynor moved in with the Hyperion to support Kerrigan's forces. After fighting their way through his elite guard, Kerrigan entered the palace herself to kill Mengsk. However, Mengsk was prepared with the Keystone, which could still harm Kerrigan. Raynor was close behind, and crushed Mengsk's control device. Without his artifact, Kerrigan sent a psionic pulse through Mengsk, killing him. Kerrigan thanked Jim, then mobilized her broods to face Amon as Jim watches Kerrigan flies off.Gameplay  A few updates have been made to the game's graphics engine, including upgrades to the look and behavior of zerg creep, as well as some changes that allow Blizzard artists to better showcase the worlds in the game. However, Blizzard intends for the expansion to have the same minimum hardware requirements as Wings of Liberty. A new feature is the rock pillar/collapsable rock tower, which can be destroyed in order to block off a choke point. Main and gas-extracting structures now display by passing the cursor the number of workers related to it. For example, passing a cursor on a hatchery will show \"workers: 10/24\" and on an extractor will show \"workers: 0/3\").Singleplayer  Heart of the Swarm has 20 main missions and 7 optional evolution missions. It requires an installed version of Wings of Liberty to play. A canon choices are the default in regards to the events of Wings of Liberty, but the game reflects player choices. References are made in character dialogue to such events. However, the impact of individual choices in Wings of Liberty is only aesthetic. The campaign operates similarly to an RPG, in which Kerrigan is focused on increasing her personal power through mutations. Zerg armies protect her as she garners this power. The greater her power, the more zerg she's able to control. Like Wings of Liberty, the player is presented with choices as to which missions to carry out and which units to get, but such choices aren't be based on cash. Both the missions and their objectives are intended to be quite different from the ones featured in Wings of Liberty. She will instead worry about evolving the Swarm. The campaign features a branched storyline structure. Each planet gives access to multiple missions. The set pieces alter in accordance with planet and the results of missions. It is intended that the missions strike a balance in regards to foes, with terrans, zerg, and protoss getting equal limelight. Missions cannot be skipped, but their order can be changed. Browder expects that it will take the average player 20 or fewer hours to complete the campaign. Many hybrids will appear in the campaign as opponents to Kerrigan. The missions of the game are intended to have a different feel than those in Wings of Liberty. In the first game of the trilogy, the zerg were rarely engaged directly and instead, it was about Raynor side-stepping them while completing his objectives. In Heart of the Swarm, the missions are more offensive in nature, such as preventing anyone from escaping an invaded planet. It is intended that character lines will be altered slightly based on context\u2014not new scenes, but ones that will be contextually appropriate. There is little use for air-to-air units in the campaign. A full listing of the single player campaign missions can be found at Heart of the Swarm missions.Kerrigan's Evolution  Kerrigan can increase her stats in a manner similar to Warcraft III, but not to the same extent. She is present on almost every singleplayer mission. Unlike Raynor, Kerrigan is a creature of power that leads her army from the front and unlike Wings of Liberty, the mission isn\u2019t over if she dies. Kerrigan is able to revive at the nearest hatchery if she is killed, allowing players to use her aggressively. Kerrigan initially starts out looking very human and armed with a gun, though she can control zerg forces.\n\n Each battle focus allows Kerrigan to have a certain set of special abilities.Unit Evolution Mechanics  Regarding the evolution pit mechanic Dustin Browder said \"we are trying to focus the player on finding new DNA from exotic and strange creatures around the sector so that you really feel like the key to zerg success is finding and infesting the immense, deadly monsters that live on the most savage planets in the galaxy.\" The developers intended to make the choices of unit type/evolution by less clear-cut than in Wings of Liberty, with different options being equally viable. Mini-missions are available when a unit split is available. The evolution missions allow the player to use both types of units, enabling the player to make an educated choice by the end of it. These changes cannot be reverted. There are 14 or so short skirmishes far from the standard missions. In one example, zerglings can be upgraded into raptors by absorbing the genetics of leaping creatures, while the alternative is to absorb a strain of feral zerg that have developed swarmlings. This is a change from the old mutagen system of evolution, which developers felt was too similar to the system of upgrades in Wings of Liberty.Characters Units  There are new multiplayer units for each of the three playable races. It was Blizzard's intention to enhance the uniqueness of each playable species in regards to gameplay and to avoid redundancy. Units, which were cut from multiplayer, make their appearances in the campaign mode.Terrans  According to Dustin Browder, the terrans have \"enough stuff already\" and as such, it is difficult to know what to do with them. Terrans are more flexible in multiplayer than the zerg or protoss and the team doesn't want to add units/unit properties that increase this trend. Reapers gain an out-of-combat regeneration ability called Combat Drugs. At BlizzCon 2011, three new terran units were revealed\u2014the warhound, the shredder and the hellbat. However, the shredder was later removed. Overall, the new terran theme for Heart of the Swarm is a mech one, standing in contrast to Wings of Liberty which was more balanced around biological terran units. As of June 2012, the widow mine, which could attack both air and ground units, was introduced. As of September 2012, during the beta, the warhound was removed. However, it was used only in campaign. A general theme for terran units in the expansion is that they are more high-tech than units in previous installments.Zerg  At BlizzCon 2011, the viper and swarm host were added to the Swarm, while the overseer was said to be removed from multiplayer. The overseer made a reappearance in the game due to changes to the viper. Prior to this, numerous ideas have been tossed around\u2014the lurker is a possibility but has not been confirmed and a different unit may be created to take the role the lurker once had. At BlizzCon 2010, the infested bunker was touted as a possible campaign unit.Protoss  The protoss were to gain three new units\u2014the oracle, the replicant and the tempest, while the mothership and carrier were to be removed from multiplayer games. As of April 2012, the replicant had been removed. As of June 2012, the mothership core, a new unit built on the nexus that can later upgrade into a Wings of Liberty mothership, was named and displayed. The carrier reappeared during the beta. A general goal of protoss development in the game is to give them more aerial firepower.Multiplayer  Blizzard planed on adding \"drawing\" functionality for referees in Heart of the Swarm, but this was not available in the final game. From a multiplayer standpoint, Heart of the Swarm is an expansion, not a sequel. It has a separate ladder from Wings of Liberty. Heart of the Swarm will have the same e-sports focus as Wings of Liberty. The expansion added a leveling system, introducing a system of leveling and rewards. In this system, experience is earned while playing matchmaking and custom games. XP is given in accordance with race played, given at the end of the match, and is earnt through each unit built and destroyed. Levels range from 1 to 20 for each race. Bonus XP can also be earnt. Each level gifts the player with a new decal or portrait. These levels have a net total; by reaching level 20 for each race, a player has a net total level of 60 for instance. A clan system was added into the game. Players can form/join clans and assign tags accordingly.Reception  Heart of the Swarm was the best selling retail PC game in North America in 2013. The game sold approximately 1.1 million units on the first two days of sale. Heart of the Swarm maintains a 86/100 on Metacritic. PCgamer gave the expansion a 91/100, calling it \"A traditional RTS essential for anyone interested in competitive strategy games, and highly recommended for anyone who isn't.\" The cinematics from Heart of the Swarm received the 2013 Golden Reel Award for Best Sound & Music Editing: Computer Interactive Entertainment from the Motion Picture Sound Editors society.Development Development History  Blizzard's storyboard team was already working on Heart of the Swarm while Wings of Liberty's gameplay was refined. The development team numbers over 150, with a core team of 70 developers. It was deemed that the game's \"zerg fantasy\" (similar to the \"terran fantasy\" of Wings of Liberty) would be focused on adapting to hostile environments, picking mutations and evolutions to become a more efficient killing machine. As of March 2011 Dustin Browder expected Heart of the Swarm to finish development in approximately one year. As of July 2011, the first part of the campaign (including cutscenes) had been completed. In October of 2011, Blizzard began releasing preview art of new units.May 2012 Announcement  As of May 2012, Blizzard announced plans to include the following functionalities in Heart of the Swarm:Beta  The beta test went live September 4, 2012. It was expected to last 3-5 months. By June 2012 the missions were complete, and Dustin Browder believed the game would be released that year. However, there was a lot of multiplayer work, UI, art and debugging to work on. On November 13, 2012, the release date of March 12, 2013 was announced. Presales became available as of then. The beta ended on March 1st, 2013.Release  The game was released on March 12, 2013. With the game's release, many of those who had worked on it were transferred to work on Heroes of the Storm.Maps  Because of feedback from Wings of Liberty players, Heart of the Swarm received larger map sizes.Units  Browder was open to the idea of the defiler being playable in the campaign, but was more reserved about the devourer. Various new types of nydus worms were being planned as well. None of these were playable in the final product.Destroyer of Worlds  \"Destroyer of Worlds\" was a mechanic that existed in a pre-release version of the game. Here, Kerrigan could select from various worlds for a broodmother to destroy, said worlds being of tactical advantage to the Dominion. In the final version of the game, while broodmothers do destroy worlds upon Kerrigan's order, there is no element of player choice or gameplay effect.Storyline  The story was intended to have a darker feel than Wings of Liberty, due to the zerg being the protagonists. According to lead writer Brian T. Kindregan, the story was intended to be \"a complete story of Sarah Kerrigan and the zerg,\" and have \"its own satisfying ending.\" He intended for the story to convey the zerg mindset and their code of ethics, though not so far to convey the idea that the zerg are simply misunderstood. Striking a balance between the \"alienness\" of zerg characters yet also making them relatable was another issue. More emphasis was placed on mission cutscenes than Wings of Liberty in regards to conveying backstory, such as information about the zerg.Dustin Browder has acknowledged that Wings of Liberty suffered from a lack of clarity at times, that character motivations were vague and the story lacked central focus. In contrast, Heart of the Swarm was to keep its focus on Kerrigan much more and hopefully avoid those problems. Location-wise, Heart of the Swarm was intended to show more exotic locales than the ones featured in Wings of Liberty\u2014no \"farm areas\" for instance. Ideas for locations include gas giants, frozen and hot worlds, places where the zerg were first formed and Dominion labs. As Heart of the Swarm neared, the online StarCraft short stories series became zerg-centric, focusing on zerg evolution. Online zerg-focused stories such as In the Blood have been published. An ongoing blog, Project Blackstone, was created to represent changes in-universe. Light was shed on zerg biology and the protoss.Cut Content  It was deemed unlikely that many characters from Wings of Liberty would return for Heart of the Swarm bar Jim Raynor and Arcturus Mengsk. It was stated that characters from StarCraft: Brood War would make appearances, with Samir Duran cited as one such possibility. Creatures could be collected for DNA from places such as Terran Dominion labs. Creatures were collected from the Daelaam Ark but not a Dominion lab. Early versions of the story included a sub-plot where Kerrigan gained revenge on Abathur for his transformation of her into the Queen of Blades, and harsher treatment of Zagara in her instruction of tactics. Cut lines indicate that hybrids were set to have been encountered in a greater abundance than they were in the game's release version. In December 2010, a video was uploaded claiming to be the ending cinematic to the game. The video was a very early rendering of the video with a temporary sound track and a watermark for The Third Floor, a company known to have done some of the cinematic work for Wings of Liberty. Blizzard did not comment on the video as part of its general policy to \"not comment on rumors or speculation\". The final version of Heart of the Swarm's ending cinematic bears multiple similarities in characterization and dialogue with the leaked cinematic.Collector's Edition  Heart of the Swarm features a Collector's Edition. It includes custom in-game content: a torrasque skin, 3 Swarm-infested portraits, 3 Swarm-infested decals, a baneling pet in World of Warcraft, and a Blade Wings & Banner sigil in Diablo III in honor of the Queen of Blades. The product includes a Heart of the Swarm art book, a zerg rush mouse pad, a Behind the Scenes Blu-ray\u2122 / DVD set and a Collector's Edition soundtrack.Heart of the Swarm Videos  Blizzard has uploaded a number of videos to demonstrate Heart of the Swarm.Battle Reports  In addition, Blizzard hosted a series of Battle Reports in June 2012.Sarah Kerrigan  Sarah Louise Kerrigan was a psychic terran female. She began her career as a Confederate ghost and later became the second-in-command of the Sons of Korhal. Following Arcturus Mengsk's betrayal, she was captured and infested by the Zerg Swarm, ultimately becoming the self-proclaimed Queen of Blades (a.k.a. the Zerg Queen) and leader of the Swarm. At the Dominion Ghost Academy, ghosts in training are told the Confederacy allowed Kerrigan to \"defect\" to the zerg. Non-control zerg strains referred to her as \"the Kerrigan.\"Sarah Kerrigan Early Life and Ghost Training  Young Sarah Kerrigan's latent powers were demonstrated during an incident on TarKossia where she accidentally killed her mother (causing her head to \"come apart\") and damaged the brain of her father, Patrick. She was quickly taken in hand from her mother's burial by Confederate agents and conscripted as a child into the Ghost Program. At eight years of age she scored highly on all phases of the psi-evaluations. Indeed, the Confederacy had to readjust their entire psionic power measurement scale in order to account for her abilities. During ghost training, her most hated instructor was Lieutenant Rumm. Rumm attempted to break her sense of right and wrong and persuade her to demonstrate her psionic powers to prove to his superiors that she was psychic. Kerrigan refused, unwilling to relive what happened to her parents. In an attempt to coerce her into using her powers, Rumm injected a kitten with a tumor-causing chemical, then ordered Kerrigan to use her powers to destroy the tumor or euthanize the kitten. Still unsuccessful Rumm threatened to shoot the kitten himself. Kerrigan refused once again and Rumm decided not to shoot, leaving the kitten to die slowly and painfully. Rumm later discovered his pistol's firing mechanism had been destroyed. However, the malfunction could be plausibly attributed to non-psionic factors, and so could not be treated as incontrovertible proof of her psionic powers. A technician recommended the use of a neuro-adjuster, a device which would weaken a ghost's psionic powers and ensure their loyalty to the Confederacy. Rumm refused as a neuro-adjuster could kill the patient. Sarah was taken to another room and strapped to a chair with a needle against her skin. In another room, she could see her brain-damaged father, similarly strapped to a chair. Rumm's scientists were about to inject her father with the same substance that caused the growth of a tumor in the kitten unless Sarah cooperated with the Confederacy. Instead, Sarah said she would kill herself and her father rather than use the power for the Confederacy. She was injected with the needle and quickly lost consciousness. Rumm felt he had no choice now but to employ the neuro-adjuster. The neural processing treatments left her a withdrawn and introverted young girl. Kerrigan would spend a year undergoing mental torture at the hands of Lieutenant Rumm. Kerrigan's further training included a combat scenario between her and an elder opponent\u2014done with combat knives while scientists watched from overhead. Even at her young age, Kerrigan was able to defeat her opponent. In defiance, she used her psionic powers to shatter the glass of the viewing room the scientists were in. However, such defiance came to nothing\u2014the Confederacy broke her down even further, to the point where Kerrigan was able to kill without remorse.Confederate Ghost  Kerrigan was designated Ghost No. 24601 (often simply Ghost No. 24) following the successful completion of training. As a Confederate agent she would go on to assassinate many of the Confederacy's enemies. Her mental conditioning meant she was physically unable to refuse a direct order given by a Confederate superior.The Assassination of Angus Mengsk  In 2489, senator Angus Mengsk declared Korhal to be a free world, independent of the Confederacy. In response, the Confederacy assigned a trio of ghosts to assassinate him and his family. Kerrigan was one of the three, and was accompanied by ghosts 24506 and 24718. They easily bypassed his security system, killing him, his wife and young daughter. Kerrigan was the one who personally killed Mengsk, decapitating him. The ghosts disappeared and took the senator's head with them.The Umojan Mission  One of Kerrigan's missions involved the newly formed Umojan Protectorate. She took position above a political rally. She lined up her sights on the target, even as a child obstructed her view. She was seemingly able to make the kill.Xenomorph Research  Kerrigan later participated in the xenomorph experiments at the Fujita Facility on Vyctor 5. The creatures were found to respond to telepathic commands when drugged and isolated.Uprising  Arcturus Mengsk, leader of the recently-formed Sons of Korhal and son of Angus Mengsk, discovered Kerrigan was at Fujita through Umojan sources. He organized a raid on the facility to retrieve her, although the rebel soldiers were not told of Kerrigan's significance or presence. By this time Kerrigan was the only experimental subject left; the remainder, unable to elicit as strong a response from the xenomorphs, were killed to maintain secrecy. The rebel raid was successful and an unconscious Kerrigan, defecting Confederates, and research materials, were conveyed to the rebels' base of operations, the battlecruiser Hyperion. There Kerrigan's neural inhibitor was removed. A number of cybernetic implants were left; years later, Kerrigan suggested this was to prevent the onset of insanity by inhibiting her ability to read thoughts. Upon awakening in Hyperion's sickward, Kerrigan was greeted by Arcturus Mengsk and Somo Hung. While Hung was smitten from the outset, she sensed Mengsk's animosity. However, Mengsk assured her she was a guest with full access to the ship. Over the following intervals Kerrigan regained fragments of past memories. She welcomed the frequent visitations by Hung but always declined his invitations to \"hang out.\" Kerrigan was privy to the Sons of Korhal xenomorph investigation, and helped to spread rumors about the creatures amongst the troops to harden resolve against the Confederacy. The Fringe Worlds where the xenomorphs were first found had been depopulated by Confederate bio-chemical weapons to keep the aliens secret. Kerrigan's decision to join the rebels was aided by the knowledge that Hung's parents were among those killed. During an engagement between the Confederate battlecruiser Norad II and the Hyperion, Ghost No. 24506 boarded the rebel ship. Kerrigan detected and killed the ghost. The dead ghost's hostile environment suit was set aside for Kerrigan's use. After a return and second departure from Umoja, Kerrigan began a relationship with Hung, almost simultaneously getting on worse terms with Lieutenant Pollock Rimes. He was already frustrated at the level of confidence she possessed in Mengsk's graces and defending Hung from his verbal abuse only made matters worse. As part of the Sons of Korhal, she was involved in a nearly suicidal attack on the Ghost Academy on Tarsonis. She found Rumm, who had been promoted to Major, and took her rather messy revenge, both for herself and for Hung, who had been killed by the major. She subsequently returned to the Hyperion with a captured Ghost No. 24718, whom Mengsk killed as an act of revenge for the death of his family two years ago. To Kerrigan's disgust and horror, much of Mengsk's recent actions had been dictated by his search for vengeance for the three ghosts who murdered his family...and having delivered the first two to Mengsk, Kerrigan was the third. However, Mengsk found her to be more useful to him alive and decided to keep her around, claiming that he'd forgiven her. Kerrigan was extremely grateful for Mengsk's decision to spare her and now fully believed in the Sons' cause.Rebel Yell  By 2499, Kerrigan's dedication to the Sons of Korhal and her competency in the field were clear to all. However, her personal loyalties were hazy, and it remained to be seen if her fellow soldiers could be loyal to her in turn.Early Actions  In 2499, Kerrigan was sent to the moon of G-2275. She familiarized herself with the Confederate base there. By December of that year, with the outbreak of the Great War, knowledge of the xenomorphs, now known as zerg, was no secret, nor was the presence of a second alien race called the protoss. During this time, Kerrigan was on Mar Sara stirring anti-Confederate sentiments, meeting UNN reporter Michael Liberty in the process. A few days later, Kerrigan encountered Liberty again, who'd got on the wrong side of Confederate law. She got him into contact with Arcturus Mengsk, who wanted Liberty to spread pro-Sons of Korhal propaganda.The Antigan Revolution  Kerrigan resurfaced on Antiga Prime, whose colonists had become very tired of the Confederacy's heavy handed policies. She reported that Antiga Prime was ready to openly revolt against the Confederacy. However, the Confederacy was aware of this, and locked down the revolt with General Duke's Alpha Squadron, whose troops seemingly took over the Antigan revolutionary military base. Kerrigan scouted out the area, then linked up with Captain Jim Raynor. The meeting didn't go well, Kerrigan's telepathy sensing Raynor's less than pure thoughts. Kerrigan infiltrated the military base and assassinated the Confederate officer in the command center, placing the base under the control of the Sons of Korhal. The combined forces then descended upon Alpha Squadron's own base, destroying it. Immediately afterward, Duke's battlecruiser, the Norad II, was shot down by the zerg over Antiga Prime. Duke called for help from his position in the crippled vessel. Mengsk ordered a rescue, prompting a sarcastic response from Kerrigan; she wanted to know if Mengsk had lost his mind. If he had, it didn't matter, as Duke was rescued, and he and his forces joined the rebels. Over the course of the fighting on Antiga Prime, Raynor and Kerrigan worked together on numerous occasions, becoming a formidable team.The Trump Card  The Antigan campaign reached its end when the Confederacy's Delta Squadron launched a major assault against the Sons of Korhal. Mengsk called a meeting of his commanders to discuss the situation. He had access to the plans for the Transplanar Psionic Waveform Emitter, or psi-emitter, which his forces had stolen from the Confederates. The devices could attract the attention of zerg from across worlds. Mengsk told Kerrigan to plant the emitter in the Confederate base, which would lure the zerg to their position. As Kerrigan undertook the mission, she told Mengsk that she didn't think anyone deserved to have the zerg unleashed on them, but Mengsk seemed to believe her past was influencing her. Teaming up with Liberty, the pair made their way across the battlefield, encountering both zerg and Confederate forces before successfully planting the psi-emitter in the Confederate base. Kerrigan asked Mengsk to never again rely on this tactic, but he only mentioned that they would do whatever it took to save humanity. Arriving on the Hyperion as Antiga Prime entered its death throes, Kerrigan met up with Raynor. Both were experiencing doubts as to what Mengsk was having them do, and they headed for the ship's galley for coffee and talk, their former antagonism having evaporated. Despite his history with telepaths, Raynor possessed genuine sympathy for Kerrigan. Sympathy gave way to mutual friendship and they \"drew close\". At some point, Raynor was given or obtained a vidsnap of Kerrigan.Team Player  Mengsk had noticed the improved relationship between Raynor and Kerrigan, and in the interim period between Antiga Prime and Tarsonis, he assigned them on a number of missions. The first was a mission back to G-2275's moon, in order to retrieve Confederate goliath designs. Kerrigan was there when Raynor and his team arrived, and the mission was a success. Next, Raynor and Kerrigan were sent to raid a science facility on Orna III. Kerrigan, who knew her way around the facility, pretended to be a ghost who had arrested the criminal Raynor. The deception worked. Several scientists and all the test subjects were rescued. The corrupt scientists were killed and the facility destroyed. Afterwards, Raynor offered her a drink and a real date at Sam's Place. One thing led to another, and the two gave into their emotions. That night, as they lay in bed, Kerrigan made Raynor promise that if the darkness in her ever went out of control, he would stop it. Their relationship took a blow over the issue of Mengsk however. Raynor had come to realize that Mengsk was no better than the government that he was trying to overthrow, that he was in this for personal gain rather than higher ideals. Kerrigan conceded part of the point, but still believed that Mengsk could bring about a better future for humanity. She voiced her concerns that she and Raynor should have never got involved.New Gettysburg  Ten days after the fall of Antiga Prime, Mengsk's revolutionary movement had reached Tarsonis, the Confederate capital world. Duke planned to assault the central space platform, allowing a small force to penetrate to the surface of Tarsonis. Kerrigan, Raynor and Liberty fought their way through the streets of Tarsonis City and Mengsk's forces successfully defeated the Confederates, but his next move surprised and dismayed Kerrigan and Raynor; his forces planted psi-emitters. Billions of zerg were lured to Tarsonis, laying waste to the Confederacy's defenses. The protoss followed, descending upon the zerg's primary hive. Mengsk ordered Kerrigan to protect the primary zerg hive from the protoss Expeditionary Force, allowing the zerg to complete the Confederacy's destruction. Raynor was getting increasingly uncomfortable with Mengsk's leadership and motivations, but was unable to convince Kerrigan to allow him to accompany her. Kerrigan completed her mission but was in turn overrun by the zerg. Mengsk callously refused to assist Kerrigan's troops; instead, the rebel fleet disengaged from the Tarsonian system. Mengsk did so due to her lack of political reliability and because he wanted long-due vengeance for the deaths of his family. The abandonment was the last straw for Raynor. He and Raynor's Rangers left the Sons of Korhal. Their first action as an independent group was an attempt to rescue Kerrigan; rising zerg activity forced them to withdraw before they could locate her.Capture by the Zerg  As the terrans fled, the Zerg Swarm had captured Kerrigan. The Overmind sensed the ghost's formidable psychic powers and, on one hand, saw a great weapon against the protoss. More subtly, the Overmind realized Kerrigan was also the key to the zerg's salvation. The Overmind was unwillingly implanted with an overriding directive to destroy the protoss. It knew this was part of a greater apocalyptic plan by the fallen xel'naga Amon to destroy not only the protoss and zerg, but to remold creation in his own image. The Overmind believed it could resist Amon's control by infesting Kerrigan. The Overmind's plan was intended to save the zerg, but it had no concern over the other races of the galaxy. Kerrigan was placed within a chrysalis by the creature Abathur. The process was painful, and she suffered much physical damage. She was entrusted to the care of a cerebrate and its brood, and was taken to Char, where her telepathic powers reached out and contacted Mengsk and Raynor. The psychic link with Raynor would persist.Queen of Blades Overmind Agent of the Swarm  The terrans converged on Char. Mengsk ordered Duke to investigate, while Raynor followed in person at the head of Raynor's Raiders to attempt a rescue. The zerg repelled both in turn. Kerrigan emerged from her chrysalis as the Raiders attacked. She adopted the title \"Queen of Blades\" and helped push the terrans back. Kerrigan confronted Raynor and allowed him to leave. The Queen of Blades was not a separate entity within Kerrigan. However, the Queen could be considered Kerrigan under the influence of some devastating forces, such as zerg mutation.Breakthrough  The prior ghost conditioning continued to limit Kerrigan's psionic potential. To break it she raided the terran science vessel Amerigo in Char orbit for Ghost Program information.Zasz, a senior cerebrate, was dismayed by the initiative and self-aggrandizement displayed by the Swarm's newest power. Kerrigan quickly developed a dislike for the cerebrate. The Overmind consoled Zasz by revealing Kerrigan's personality was as intended. Not wanting to hamper Kerrigan's strategic and intellectual strengths, the Overmind had left her a degree of will that differed from other cerebrates. Kerrigan's psionic abilities developed rapidly after the Amerigo. One ability she developed was psionic storm. More importantly, she could now sense the presence of the protoss Tassadar on the planet. Tassadar goaded the impulsive Kerrigan into battle; this allowed Zeratul, a Dark Templar, to infiltrate and permanently slay Zasz. Zasz had sensed the protoss' duplicity but Kerrigan had ignored its warnings. The Queen of Blades was not perturbed by the cerebrate's death, but was annoyed from being tricked. She zealously led the counterattack against the protoss, and remained on Char to continue persecuting them when the Swarm departed for Aiur. Raynor and the surviving Raiders allied with the protoss to survive. During the running battles, Kerrigan tormented Raynor through the mental link, giving him pleasure and then guilt in his dreams. However, this untrained link allowed Raynor to interpret zerg communication and provide the allies with intelligence. After weeks of evading and wearing down Kerrigan's brood the allies counterattacked. First, they found a secure location, and destroyed Kerrigan's overlord after purposely allowing it to spot them. This allowed the allies to relocate without harassment. Next, Tassadar, having been taught to wield Dark Templar powers by Zeratul, slew the cerebrate directing the Queen of Blade's brood. This deprived Kerrigan of most of her forces, but she still managed to trap the protoss and terrans. During a heated discussion Zeratul vanished. The timely arrival of the Fleet of the Executor, led by Executor Artanis, forced Kerrigan to retreat, although she vowed an eventual reckoning. After the departure of the protoss from Char, the zerg attacked Maltair IV. Kerrigan was believed to be behind it.Ascension  The final battle on Aiur ended when the Overmind was destroyed by Tassadar which left the zerg Swarms scattered. Kerrigan was on Char at the time and became aware of the creature's death. In an instant, she learned the true nature of her creation and knew that the time for her ascension had come.Shadow of the Xel'Naga  During this time, Kerrigan had spent her time covering Char with creep and created the Kukulkan Brood. She felt a psionic pulse coming from a recently-activated xel'naga structure on Bhekar Ro. She sent the Kukulkan brood to take control of the structure, but it came into conflict with protoss who had also felt the signal as well as Alpha Squadron, which had been sent to help the colonists. However, the structure turned out to be a trap: it was actually a chrysalis who required the energy and DNA of both protoss and zerg to complete its transformation. The whole Kukulkan Brood was wiped out by the phoenix creature. Kerrigan considered this an acceptable loss.The Brood War Alliance with the Protoss  After the death of the first Overmind, many zerg cerebrates, commanded by Daggoth, merged into a new Overmind for the Swarms. However, Kerrigan, now in charge of approximately half of the zerg Swarm, began a campaign aimed at eliminating these cerebrates in order to rule over the Swarms by herself. As part of her plan, Kerrigan took control of the Dark Templar Matriarch, Raszagal, even before she arrived on Shakuras, homeworld of the Dark Templar. Shortly afterward Zeratul, Artanis and the protoss survivors of Aiur traveled through the warp gate which connected Aiur to Shakuras. They were closely followed by zerg which included two cerebrates allied with Daggoth's new Overmind. These cerebrates nestled around the xel'naga temple of Shakuras, a powerful artifact capable of wiping the zerg off the planet. Raszagal informed the newly-arrived protoss of the temple's powers which required the use of the two lost crystals: the Uraj and Khalis, but she ordered the protoss to first slay the two cerebrates around the temple, which was done. Kerrigan made an appearance right after this event, asking to be escorted to their Citadel. She claimed that with the Overmind dead, she was no longer being controlled. However, a new Overmind was growing on Char and when it reached maturity it would take control of her. The protoss, especially Aldaris, didn't trust her, but Raszagal (under her influence) welcomed her. Kerrigan was unsuccessful in convincing Zeratul to assault the new Overmind but she did garner good will with the protoss by helping them acquire the Uraj and the Khalis. Upon their return to Shakuras, Aldaris was in the midsts of launching an open revolt against Raszagal. He had discovered Kerrigan's influence on her, but he did not attempt to inform Artanis and Zeratul of this until he had been defeated. However, Kerrigan swiftly arrived and slew him as he tried to reveal the secret. A furious Zeratul ordered her to leave for her interference. Kerrigan bragged that she had forced the protoss to slay her enemies, the two cerebrates on Shakuras, before leaving the planet. Zeratul and Artanis activated the xel'naga temple and destroyed the zerg on Shakuras, but by this time Kerrigan had left. Due to her machinations, the cerebrates who refused to follow her lead were all but destroyed.Against the New Overmind  During the United Earth Directorate invasion of the Koprulu sector, it acquired the Psi disrupter, a powerful anti-zerg weapon, but the leader of the UED force, Admiral Gerard DuGalle, squandered its use due to the influence and advice of Samir Duran. Vice Admiral Alexei Stukov secretly disassembled the device and hid it from DuGalle, which would later spark charges of treason. The UED conquered Korhal, throne world of the Terran Dominion, and attempted to capture Mengsk. However, Mengsk was \"rescued\" by Raynor and Fenix, who transported him to Aiur. The UED pursued. The zerg, with help from Duran (seemingly an infested terran minion working for Kerrigan, who looked just like a regular terran) helped rescue Mengsk and Raynor from the UED. Exploiting the fear of the UED, Kerrigan had put together a coalition with Fenix and Raynor on Aiur. Fenix didn't trust her at all, but Raynor's fear of the UED was strong enough for him to persuade Fenix to fight alongside him and Kerrigan. DuGalle ordered the Psi disrupter to be activated, then his force descended upon Char to capture the new Overmind. His forces were successful in their mission. Kerrigan and Duran confronted him shortly after his victory, telling him that all of the zerg, plus Duran, belonged to her, and that she would defeat him despite his Psi disrupter, with the help of certain allies.Unlikely Alliance  Kerrigan had contacted Raynor and Fenix on Aiur, alerting them to the new Overmind and the UED's plans for controlling it. Contacting them again on Shakuras, she asked them for help. Kerrigan also struck an alliance with Mengsk, contacting them on Shakuras. Together they rescued the remains of the Dominion fleet from the UED. Mengsk was her prisoner, and she told him he could be emperor of his own eight-by-eight cell if he didn't agree to her proposal. The allies destroyed the poorly-defended external power generators for the Psi disrupter for her, and with the help of psi-emitters provided by Mengsk, she took control of nearby dormant zerg and used them to destroy the Disrupter. In order to enhance her Swarm for the upcoming attack on the UED on Korhal, Kerrigan proposed a resource raid on Moria. Her allies stood aside as she infested Kel-Morian Combine personnel. She led the attack on the UED forces on Korhal, defeating them. However, she and Duran quickly turned against her allies when they were resting from the battle, killing both Duke and Fenix. Raynor and Mengsk were left very bitter about this betrayal, and Raynor swore he would see her dead for it. Kerrigan let Mengsk live however, as he was no threat to her. And as payback for Tarsonis, she wanted to let him live, to see her rise to power, to remember that he was the one who had allowed her transformation to occur. She also brushed off Raynor's vow of vengeance, doubting that he had it in him. Regardless, her enemies decimated, she withdrew her forces to Tarsonis, weary of the slaughter.To Slay the Beast  Kerrigan managed to repel UED counterattacks on her forces on Tarsonis as she schemed for the destruction of the Overmind. She traveled to Shakuras and retrieved Raszagal. Kerrigan brought Raszagal to Char, followed by a vengeful Zeratul, demanding to know why his Matriarch had been taken. Kerrigan proposed a deal - she would allow Raszagal to return if Zeratul agreed to slay the Overmind. Raszagal convinced him to go, saying the Overmind was a threat to both Kerrigan and the protoss. Zeratul had no choice; though he knew killing the Overmind would only make the treacherous Kerrigan stronger, he consented. His Dark Templar participated beside her forces in the battle, killing renegade zerg and UED troops alike before ultimately destroying the Overmind. Then Zeratul again demanded the return of the Matriarch. Kerrigan agreed ... but Raszagal did not. Under Kerrigan's control, Raszagal said she wanted to stay. This did not fool Zeratul, who spirited her away and fled.Consolidation of Power  Kerrigan had killed the Overmind's cerebrates, using the Dark Templar she had manipulated, and brought virtually all the zerg in the sector under her control. Kerrigan gave orders to recapture Zeratul and Raszagal. Her forces were almost successful, but Zeratul chose to slay Raszagal rather than allow her to live as a slave to Kerrigan. The surprised Kerrigan let Zeratul leave Char to live with his guilt. Meanwhile, Duran disappeared. Kerrigan had no idea what Duran was planning. Kerrigan defended her base from a combined attack led by Mengsk, Artanis and DuGalle, leaving her as the ruler of the most powerful force in the sector. Kerrigan destroyed the remnants of the UED Expeditionary Force, but let the Dominion and protoss forces retreat. Standing alone on the platform, Kerrigan found herself the ruler of all she surveyed. Unable to shake the feeling that a great threat loomed just over the horizon, she could only stare off into the vastness of space where she beheld a great void. Or perhaps a reflection of a hollow victory and of the trials yet to come...Interbellum Post Bellum  By the end of the Brood War, Kerrigan had become the undisputed ruler of the zerg. Kerrigan pulled back to Char in the aftermath of the war, out of sight, but not out of mind. The Dominion considered the zerg to be \"too quiet\" and though Kerrigan was the one responsible for the apparent cessation of hostilities, her motives were unknown, although it had nothing to do with Duran (only known to Kerrigan herself). She learned something of Duran's activities and of a looming threat. Kerrigan believed herself to be the ruler of the zerg in the aftermath of the war, but this wasn't true, as a dark influence crept into her thoughts, exerting its will through the zerg mutagens within her. This influence was from Amon, though he did not directly control her. Over the next four years, she quietly prepared the Swarm.Chains of Command  Kerrigan no longer required cerebrates since the death of the second Overmind, the Overmind's cerebrates having been destroyed although at least one remained at her side in the war's aftermath. At least four cerebrates survived on Braxis for a time. She feared the cerebrates might once again try to form a new Overmind, and besides, they had no place in her new vision for the Swarm. At some point during this time, Jim Raynor attempted an attack on Kerrigan, trying to make good on his vow to see her dead during the Brood War. However, the attack failed. During this period, Kerrigan directed zerg evolution as per her own designs, sending out her forces to explore and exploit various worlds and assimilate new species. She paid particular attention to species with hyper-regenerative properties. Additionally, she carried out a project to devise more intelligent infested terrans. Eventually Kerrigan overcame her dislike of the idea of sapient zerg under her control and created brood mothers to fill the roles the cerebrates once maintained. She wished the Swarm to be able to survive even if she fell. Having sapient lieutenants would extend her control of the Swarm. The broodmothers were in service by 2501. Kerrigan utilized smaller operations to disrupt Dominion command. She allowed the Dominion to believe they had successfully weaponized captured hydralisks through Project Tamed, and when they attacked the planet of Thys, had them turn on the Dominion and their high ranking officers. Kerrigan personally oversaw the operation, relishing the kill of the project's director, Sandra Loew, who she saw as a \"false queen.\"Garrxax  Following the Brood War, Kerrigan became obsessed with the genetic codes of species with hyper-regenerative properties. In 2501, Kerrigan directed a wounded behemoth to the world of Garrxax. This gave the Swarm access to roaches.Artika  In 2502, Kerrigan's zerg took part in a battle on Artika, a planet housing a xel'naga temple. The protoss gained control of the temple, though Kerrigan was unfazed.Preserver's Saga  In 2503, Kerrigan's preparations to return to the Koprulu Sector were nearly complete, and she was enthused about the prospect of returning to slaughter. She still intended to carry out the original zerg mission, although had added revenge to her list of motives. Her preperations were interrupted when she became aware of a strange psychic phenomenon; a terran-protoss linking, similar to the Khala, emanating near the world of Dead Man's Rock (the originators were a terran named Jake Ramsey and a protoss preserver named Zamara). Several hours after detecting the psionic emanation, her forces arrived, capturing at least one terran, the crime lord Ethan Stewart. Stewart had been wearing a psi-screen at the time, leading Kerrigan to believe he was psychic (and the originator of the effect), and she realized the truth only after she had captured him. She transformed him into an infested terran so that he would serve her as a general and consort, and also to question him about the effects (the madness caused by the psi-screen prevented her from reading his mind without infesting him first). Stewart emerged from his cocoon and quickly fell under her control. After questioning him about Ramsey, she sent him to capture Ramsey on Aiur, since the preserver was valuable to her \"beyond measure\", but the attempt stalled, as his forces were unable to overcome Ulrezaj, a powerful dark archon who also wished to capture Ramsey. During the ensuring battle, Ramsey escaped, and the warp gate was sealed. Kerrigan took to berating Stewart for his failures. Kerrigan and Stewart jointly controlled their forces in a new operation; they would pursue the wounded Ulrezaj into his lair, as they believed he knew how to find Ramsey. Ulrezaj regained some of his energy, but constant zerg attacks eventually forced him to fight back (dismaying both zerg commanders) before fleeing. Stewart tracked him to Ehlna, a moon sacred to the Dark Templar. Ramsey was undergoing a ritual at a protoss shrine to remove the preserver from him there. Stewart's zerg tried to acquire Ramsey before Ulrezaj did, but Ulrezaj was too powerful for the zerg to defeat. Even the unanticipated arrival of the Terran Dominion and unexpected protoss resistance failed to stop Ulrezaj, but he mysteriously disappeared from the battlefield. Stewart's forces had been weakened during the battle, and the Dominion shot down his mutalisk, severely injuring him. As his former lover Rosemary Dahl approached, with backup from the protoss executor, Selendis, Kerrigan cut off contact with Stewart. She considered him to be a failure and allowed him to die, but the circumstances of his infestation a success. She could repeat it in order to create a new consort.Whispers of Doom  Under Kerrigan's leadership, the zerg were becoming \"much, much more\", the final metamorphosis having \"only just begun.\" Nonetheless, the feelings of unease Kerrigan had felt at the end of the Brood War continued to concern her. Insight gained of the coming threat during the interbellum caused only pessimism, and she was resigned to accept it, though wanted to send the zerg out in a blaze of glory in the final battle she knew was approaching. She had become fatalistic because her zerg mutagens still left her open to Amon's influence. Eventually she journeyed to Ulaan in search of an ancient prophecy. She was followed there by a protoss force led by Karass. As Kerrigan predicted, Zeratul was also drawn there searching for the same thing. The two sparred briefly, and Kerrigan ended up capturing Zeratul in a psionic prison. As Kerrigan discovered, the Nerazim was not prepared to give up all hope for the future. Zeratul escaped from the prison, severed the Queen of Blade's left wing, and fled. Kerrigan's wing promptly regrew. Zeratul recovered three fragments of the prophecy from the shrines but was intercepted by Kerrigan before he could leave the planet. However, Zeratul received aid from a protoss force led by Praetor Karass. Karass had pursued Kerrigan to Ulaan and willingly sacrificed himself and his troops to buy time for Zeratul to escape with the fragments. Following the line of investigation, Zeratul eventually discovered Kerrigan was the key to stopping the hybrids and their master, Amon. Zeratul passed this information to Raynor and instructed him to ensure Kerrigan's survival.Wings of Liberty  After four years of relative calm, Kerrigan drove the Swarm into a massive invasion of terran space and sparked the Second Great War. She sought a disassembled xel'naga device scattered throughout the sector in order to give the zerg as much of a chance as possible in the future conflict she had sensed. The Queen of Blades led from the front as the Swarm infested terran worlds, attacking research centers, and raiding archaeological sites. Her primary competitor was Raynor, commissioned by the Moebius Foundation to retrieve the same device. The terran rebels' ability to steal away with device components before the Swarm elicited Kerrigan's grudging respect. It was not long before Kerrigan struck at the Foundation directly; she recognized their pivotal role in the Raiders' success, and sought the Foundation's data cores on Tyrador VIII which would lead her to the remaining components. The timely intervention of the Raiders prevented her from acquiring any of the data. By this point, she was aware of the artifacts' true purpose, and saw through Dr. Emil Narud's \"pathetic charade\". The zerg conceded the race when the terrans retrieved the second last component from Typhon XI. The zerg invasion of the sector slowed and Kerrigan returned to Char. Ironically, the device would soon come to her. A joint Dominion and Raynor's Raiders battlegroup attacked Char, believing the device could deinfest Kerrigan. The zerg were prepared and the terrans suffered heavy casualties establishing a foothold and pushing to the primary hive cluster. The Queen of Blades was not overly concerned; both she and her opposites knew the terrans had little time to achieve their objective before being defeated by massive zerg superiority. When the terrans entrenched at the base of the primary hive cluster with the completed xel'naga artifact, the Queen of Blades saw an opportunity to seize the artifact and crush the invasion at once. She was impressed by the artifact's power, but this did not deter her from personally leading attacks on the terran defenses. As the battle progressed, elements of her old personality seemed to resurface, telling her foes to \"not give up\" for a brief moment. The terrans weathered Kerrigan's psionic prowess and activated the device. The resulting energy wave destroyed local zerg forces and deinfested the Queen of Blades, altering her DNA and making her more human than zerg. Raynor and Tychus Findlay led a small squad of Dominion and Raiders marines into the hive and found Kerrigan dazed and deinfested. She was unable to prevent Findlay from attempting to execute her; the former convict would win freedom from Mengsk with Kerrigan's death. She was saved by Raynor who blocked the would-be executioner's bullet before shooting and killing Findlay. Kerrigan was carried outside by Raynor. That Kerrigan had not been slain on Char was a point of divergence from a vision of the future glimpsed at by the Overmind.Flashpoint  Kerrigan's new state had a mostly human form, but still had some zerg traits such as her dreadlock-like antennae instead of hair, leaving open the question of how infested she was and whether she had her own personality back. While carrying her away from her hive, Raynor noticed that her \"dreadlocks\" felt the same as the rest of her skin. What was also noticeable was how weakened Kerrigan had become, as she began succumbing to Char's hostile atmosphere. After protecting her with insulweave, Raynor carried her to a waiting dropship, while fighting off the now leaderless zerg along the way. Kerrigan was taken aboard the Dominion flagship Bucephalus, commanded by Valerian Mengsk, son of Arcturus. Due to the arrival of his father and a battle-ready Dominion fleet, Kerrigan and her rescuers were forced to flee to Dead Man's Rock. While there, Kerrigan's health worsened, both physically and mentally, and she even tried to remove her \"hair.\" However, her powers began to return, and she was able to warn Raynor and co. of an ambush planned by Gary Crane. As the group left the world with Doctor Emil Narud, Kerrigan made it clear that she did not trust him, nor his scientists. Kerrigan and co. arrived at the Moebius Foundation station Prometheus. There, she underwent preliminary tests, but it wasn't long before Narud revealed that he was in league with Mengsk and sure enough, the emperor and his fleet arrived in the area. Mengsk contacted the station, saying he'd let his enemies live provided that Kerrigan was turned over. Becoming enraged at the sound of Mengsk's voice, Kerrigan let loose her fury, killing numerous Foundation marines and even engaged in battle with a hybrid. Kerrigan and her allies successfully escaped, but she accidentally killed one of the Raiders in the process. The group headed for a top-secret Umojan space station, where the rebels' battlecruisers could be repaired, and Kerrigan could be given treatment. The rebels had grown frightened of her and wouldn't have her on the Hyperion. Kerrigan swore vengeance against Mengsk.Hope and Vengeance  Kerrigan was incarcerated in Research Station EB-103 and given a hostile environment suit to wear. For the first two weeks she appeared to be in a comatose state, refusing any food or water. Valerian, intent on studying her and seeing how much zerg influence remained in her, ordered an assistant to administer an IV. Kerrigan lashed out\u2014instinctively, he believed, due to the lack of brain activity detected. However, that was cold comfort to the assistants, who were killed in the process. However, Kerrigan's brain functions began to recover. She recalled her past life, as a ghost, as the Queen of Blades, and all the horror both roles entailed. These shockwaves killed another of Valerian's technicians as she remained in a psychic coma. Kerrigan reflected on Raynor's rescue and de-infestation of her. She reasoned that she owed it to him to at least try and hope for a better future, but did not regard herself as human. During this, Kerrigan's psionic powers began to spiral out of control, and Valerian activated the destruct system. He called it off however, as she revealed that she'd used those same powers to reshape the explosive charges, which, if detonated, would kill him instead. Thus, the testing continued, though Kerrigan's hostility remained.Heart of the Swarm To Take the Queen  Kerrigan's personality reasserted itself, but she still felt guilty for her previous actions during the Brood War, even though she hadn't been in her \"right mind\" at the time. Regardless, she held a grudge against Mengsk. Her Queen of Blades persona had been unconcerned with revenge, but Sarah Kerrigan knew that Mengsk wanted her dead, and held a grudge against him for abandoning her on Tarsonis. Three weeks since her de-infestation, Raynor had enough. He visited the lab, ready to take Kerrigan with him\u2014the test Valerian would conduct would be the last. However, while Kerrigan had regained her cognitive functions, she made no secret of her desire for revenge. Raynor wanted her to let it go, but Kerrigan maintained that while Mengsk lived, the two couldn't have a future together. The test began. Kerrigan's memory of her time as the Queen of Blades was still patchy, but Valerian continued the experiment anyway, desiring to see how much zerg mutagen remained in Kerrigan's system. He provided her with some zerg to control, and despite her de-infestation, Kerrigan was able to control them and spawn more at will- even zerglings, despite Valerian's orders to the contrary. Determined to show the prince that the zerg couldn't be controlled, Kerrigan set them loose on the base's sub-level. No-one was killed, but there was much damage, including the destruction of the Eradicator. Her point made, Kerrigan sent the zerg back to the pens. Appreciating the point, Valerian agreed to release her. Raynor met up with Kerrigan afterwards. She expressed guilt for her past actions as the Queen of Blades, and commented that maybe Raynor should have let Findlay kill her on Char. Raynor insisted he had no regrets though\u2014Findlay had made his choice, he'd made his, and Kerrigan was no longer the Queen of Blades. He went to suit up. And it was just as well, for the Dominion had found them. The Dominion battlecruisers sent drop pods crashing into the facility. Under the command of Nova, they fanned out, looking for Kerrigan. One of the teams found her, but Kerrigan used her psionic powers to kill her attackers. Kerrigan reflected how the killing would never stop until Mengsk was dead. Raynor snapped her out of it by reminding her they had to leave, and would have to fight their way out. He tossed Kerrigan one of her attackers' weapons, and despite the 4 years of absence, Kerrigan instinctively got back into the game. The pair set out to make their escape. With the aid of the Umojan forces, the pair fought their way through the facility, taking out everything the Dominion threw at them. Nova was able to send them down to the sub-level, where not only did the pair have to deal with an impending lockdown, but the now feral zerg that Kerrigan had spawned. Still, they wouldn't be stopped, and kept moving. They reached the base's tram station, and after fending off more Dominion forces, they arrived at their destination\u2014the shuttle bay. However, Dominion forces had taken control of it, among which was the Archangel. The vehicle destroyed the bridge connecting the bay and the tram terminal, separating the pair. Raynor told Kerrigan he'd find another way around while Kerrigan and the Umojans were left to take the vehicle down themselves. The Archangel was destroyed, but Raynor contacted Kerrigan\u2014he was cut off, and he told her to take his ship. Kerrigan initially refused but Valerian, who was by now on the Hyperion, told her that he'd send a team to extract Raynor. Kerrigan agreed to take the ship, but warned Valerian not to mess things up, and that Raynor better not die on her. After a trip through warp space, Kerrigan docked with the Hyperion, now above Phaethon along with a number of other allied ships. Arriving on the bridge however, she found Raynor to be absent. Valerian uneasily explained that they hadn't been able to extract Raynor. Kerrigan lashed out, using her psionic powers to choke Valerian, ignoring Horner's demands for her to stand down, and sending the Umojan marines who tried to intervene flying against the walls. What made matters worse was the arrival of the Dominion Fleet, which opened fire and continued firing, even after Horner told them that Valerian was onboard the Hyperion. The distraction was enough to get Kerrigan to let go of the prince. But despite Horner's plan of leaving the rendezvous point and circling back to pick up Raynor, Kerrigan wasn't interested. As the rebel fleet warped away, she took the dropship down to the planet's surface. Dominion ground forces were already there however. Not only were they out in force, but they had set up a Drakken pulse cannon. Kerrigan knew that if Raynor warped into the space above the planet, it would shoot him down in an instant. Out of options, Kerrigan took control of a brood under the command of broodmother Naktul. The creature welcomed her \"queen\" back to the Swarm, but Kerrigan wasn't interested. The zerg were a means to an end, nothing more, to destroy the cannon and the Dominion forces guarding it. Both the cannon and the terrans were destroyed, yet Kerrigan was uneasy, as she found herself slipping back into her old persona. She took refuge in the dropship, hoping to contact Raynor. A zergling entered the dropship, and Kerrigan quickly grabbed her rifle and aimed at the zergling's head. The zergling backed away. Kerrigan tried to contact Raynor, but instead picked up a UNN broadcast. It declared that Raynor had been captured and killed, before showing a triumphant Mengsk declaring that the war was over. The zergling that entered the dropship earlier approached her and looked at her eye-to-eye. Distraught, and with nothing left save vengeance, Kerrigan embraced her darker nature. Seeking revenge on Mengsk, she nonetheless knew that few terrans would help her. Thus, she turned to the zerg. She set a course for zerg space, intent on rebuilding the Swarm and using it to make Mengsk pay for everything he'd done.The Queen Resurgent  Kerrigan took the dropship to a leviathan. There, she met with the creature Izsha, a creation of hers from her days as the Queen of Blades. Kerrigan wanted the Swarm to move on Korhal, but as Izsha informed her, the Swarm was in disarray, the broodmothers vying for control in light of the power vacuum Kerrigan's de-infestation had created. It was a situation Kerrigan resolved to rectify. Onboard the leviathan, Kerrigan also met Abathur, who would help her evolve the Swarm.Char  Kerrigan quickly brought Zagara to heel on Char, and then led an assault on Warfield's base, decimating it. Kerrigan confronted an injured Warfield, who begged her to allow the wounded to evacuate. When Kerrigan remained silent, Warfield called her a traitor, condemning her for abandoning her humanity over revenge. After asking how many innocents she murdered, and how many more had to die (and still being met with silence), he reminded her that she was throwing away what Raynor had done for her and asked her what he would think of her actions now. At this, Kerrigan became enraged and brutally finished off the general, but nonetheless withdrew her forces just as they were about to finish off the evacuees too injured to fight back.Kaldir  Kerrigan traveled to Kaldir, to reclaim Nafash and her brood. Unfortunately Nafash had been killed by the protoss, who quickly tried to alert Shakuras of Kerrigan's weakened state. Kerrigan stopped the first attempt, during which a protoss scientist named Lasarra was captured. Kerrigan destroyed the protoss shuttles that tried to warp to Shakuras and ultimately wiped out the final escape ship by implanting Lassara with a broodmother, Niadra. Letting Lassara be teleported to the ship, Niadra errupted from her body and, using the organisms stored onboard, was able to overrun the ship. Niadra was left to her own devices. Kerrigan later defended Lassara's memory from Izsha (who had called the protoss's presence disturbing), telling her she did not derive any satisfaction from her death.Zerus  During her resurgence, Zeratul had boarded Kerrigan's leviathan and after a brief scuffle, was able to convince her to travel to the zerg homeworld of Zerus to claim the power of the primal zerg. Kerrigan was skeptical of the prophecies, but agreed in order to gain the power she needed to kill Mengsk. Upon arriving at Zerus, Kerrigan learned from Zeratul that in order to gain the power of the primal zerg, she would first have to awaken Zurvan the Ancient One - a zerg older than the Overmind. Though suspicious of Zeratul's motives, Kerrigan's desire for revenge compelled her to take his advice. During this time, Kerrigan was attacked by the primal zerg, who regarded her Swarm as \"corrupt\". Kerrigan's forces fended off the primal zerg attackers, and successfully awakened Zurvan. Zurvan informed Kerrigan that the fallen xel'naga Amon was responsible for enslaving the zerg and corrupting them through the hive mind as part of his plot to destroy both protoss and zerg and remake all life in his image. Zurvan also explained that the few zerg who escaped Amon's influence became the primal zerg, and that Kerrigan must allow Zerus to remake her if she was to claim the power of the primals. Despite knowing that her humanity would be lost again, Kerrigan agreed to this. She allowed Zurvan to lead her to the first spawning pool where the zerg had first evolved. Against Abathur's advice, she entered the pool to begin her transformation. Before sealing herself within a chrysalis, she ordered her minions to defend her until she either emerged from the chrysalis or was dead. She hoped that in her new form, Amon would exert no influence over her mind. The primal zerg ferociously assaulted Kerrigan's position, but Kerrigan's zerg held them off long enough for the transformation to be complete. Kerrigan emerged from the chrysalis as the Primal Queen of Blades; making her presence known to all of Zerus. Upon returning to her leviathan, Kerrigan was met by Dehaka, a primal zerg pack leader who wished to join her Swarm, pledging to serve her in exchange for new sources of essence. Kerrigan accepted Dehaka and his pack into the Swarm. Dehaka informed her that the other primal pack leaders would not submit to Kerrigan and thus, had to be eliminated. Although Yagdra, Kraith, Slivan and their respective packs fought viciously against Kerrigan's Swarm, they were ultimately no match for the reborn Queen of Blades. After collecting their essences, Kerrigan was confronted by Zurvan, who initially acclaimed her for her victory. He then turned on her, with the intention of consuming her essence; explaining that he had \"no allegiance but to self.\" Kerrigan expected his challenge and killed Zurvan, thus fully claiming the power of all Zerus. With her mission on Zerus complete, Kerrigan ordered Izsha to prepare the leviathan to return to the Koprulu sector.The Queen's Return  Kerrigan's broodmothers delivered a communicator, and, on cue, a message from Arcturus Mengsk was delivered. Mengsk told her that Raynor was alive, but that if she brought her Swarm to bear against Korhal or him, Raynor would be killed. Kerrigan couldn't sense Raynor, but swore that she'd rescue him, and set a course for Dominion space.Skygeirr Station  Kerrigan was contacted by an unknown entity, who claimed to know of Kerrigan's desire to topple Mengsk. The figure told her that her chances of defeating Mengsk were nullified as long as his hybrid were alive and that defeating them was a top priority. Kerrigan tracked the figure to Skygeirr Station, and upon arrival, she questioned its identity. It revealed itself to be an infested Alexi Stukov. He told her that Narud was in fact a shapeshifter who \"had worn many faces over the years\" and served Amon. Stukov claimed that Narud had made him into whom he was and that he was the victim of countless experiments by Narud. To destroy the lab, Kerrigan first needed to destroy the Dominion garrison protecting the lab's topmost level, which was protected by infantry and heavy weapons. To this end, she utilized infestors to spawn infested terrans at the garrison's complement. The terrans used gas to wipe out the infested, but there was a delay between each usage of the gas. In the end, Kerrigan's zerg destroyed the garrison and then entered the lab. On the lower level of the lab, Narud unleashed eight hybrid dominators to psionically sap Kerrigan's life. They were defeated, as was the Dominion garrison entrenched at the same level. Kerrigan then ordered the Swarm to flood the remaining levels of the lab and eradicate everything within. However, the lab was built atop a xel'naga temple, and here the Swarm encountered protoss Tal'darim warriors who worshiped Amon and served him. Narud personally tried to kill Kerrigan with a null-zone, which Kerrigan countered with her own. Narud drew power from several xel'naga temples located throughout the level. With Kerrigan locked in combat with Narud, Stukov was left to lead the zerg to destroy the temples. The protoss attacked the zerg, reinforced by hybrid reavers, but ultimately, the zerg prevailed. Eventually, Stukov deactivated all of the xel'naga temples and Narud lost the null-zone battle. He retreated even deeper into the temple, where he was confronted by Kerrigan. Morphing first into Raynor and then Kerrigan's pre-infestation form, he nearly killed her with a psi-blade but in turn, Kerrigan fatally wounded him with her wings. Before dying, Narud told her that Amon was alive, and that she would encounter him soon. It was the truth, for as Kerrigan looked into Narud's mind, she realized that Amon had indeed been resurrected. Kerrigan was brought back to the leviathan to be healed. She revealed what she had learned from Narud, that Amon was alive, and was a threat to the zerg. Once Mengsk was dealt with, they would have to face him in turn.Reuniting with Raynor  Kerrigan made contact with the Hyperion. Matt Horner and Valerian Mengsk were shocked to see that Kerrigan had returned to her zerg form, but agreed to help her find Jim. After retrieving Colonel Orlan from Mira Han, they forced Orlan to hack into the Dominion's network and locate Raynor. They learned that Jim was being held aboard the prison ship Moros which was currently docked at Atlas Station. Kerrigan launched an assault on the Moros and boarded it. Mengsk attempted to kill both of them by triggering a self-destruct without the crew's knowledge, but Kerrigan was able to use her leviathan to stabilize the section where Raynor was being held. Raynor was horrified to see that Kerrigan had willingly reinfested herself, and brushed off her justifications by reminding her of Fenix's murder, as well as the millions of others she had murdered in cold blood, to which she offered no defense. Kerrigan gave him his gun, put it to her forehead, and told him that he was both the one who swore to kill the Queen of Blades and the one who believed in her. She asked him if he still believed in her. After some hesitation, Raynor fired...again and again. Yet for all that, he couldn't, or wouldn't, hit her. Kerrigan told Raynor that she would always love him, but he coldly declared their relationship was over.Vengeance  With Narud and his hybrids destroyed and Raynor saved, Kerrigan ordered the swarm to invade Korhal. The swarm surrounded Korhal with dozens of leviathans, preventing reinforcements from getting through. Kerrigan's first priority was to destroy Korhal's planetary defenses. She had Abathur devise the bile launcher, a modified virophage that could destroy the defense cannons from a long range. However, the launchers themselves had to be planted on the surface. Thus, Kerrigan unleashed millions of drop pods upon Korhal. Though many were shot down, a sufficient number landed on the outskirts of Augustgrad. Kerrigan herself entered the fray and secured the landing site of the bile launchers that eventually destroyed the Dominion defense, allowing the rest of the swarm to land and drive the Dominion into the city. At this time, Mengsk activated his newest weapon: The Psi Destroyer. This device emitted a field that could kill the zerg through their psionic connection to a hive mind. Having anticipated this, however, Kerrigan, sent Dehaka and his primal zerg (who had no hive mind connections) to take out the Destroyer's power generators. The swarm then eradicated the dormant weapon and its defenders. After conferring the final attack plans with her lieutenants and one last communication with the Hyperion, Kerrigan invaded Augustgrad. On Prince Valerian's request, Kerrigan slowed her invasion to let Korhal's civilians evacuate unscathed. The zerg encountered heavy resistance from the Dominion's elite guard, who possessed enhanced weapons, as well as the Odin. Unexpectedly however, Raynor and the Hyperion came to Kerrigan's aid. With the combined might of Raynor, Zagara, Dehaka and Stukov, Kerrigan eradicated Mengsk's defenders and breached the palace. She ordered Zagara to take command of the swarm while she entered the palace to deal with Mengsk alone. Inside the palace, Kerrigan cut her way through Mengsk's final defenses and made her way to Mengsk's office at the top where the emperor was expecting her. He brought his last weapon to bear: the xel'naga artifact, though this time he planned to use it to destroy her directly. Mengsk used the device to disable and torment Kerrigan while gloating, calling Kerrigan his greatest failure. Unfortunately for the tyrant, his gloating allowed Raynor to intervene in the nick of time; he crushed the control for the artifact and threw Mengsk across the room. Enraged, Kerrigan impaled Mengsk to the wall by his shoulders and after a final bitter exchange of words, overflowed him with her psionic energies. Mengsk exploded violently, blasting a massive hole through the wall behind. Though she departed Korhal immediately following Mengsk's death, she thanked Raynor \"for everything\" he'd given her before she left. Her vengeance fufilled, all that remained for Kerrigan was to send the Swarm against its true enemy, Amon.Legacy of the Void  Kerrigan took the Swarm away from the Koprulu sector as part of her attempt to find Amon, hoping to avoid the coming oblivion that awaited the galaxy.Whispers of Oblivion  Kerrigan led the zerg against a Moebius Foundation base which had fallen thrall to the mind control of hybrids within the facility. She was contacted by Zeratul, who told her that the Foundation had kidnapped Khalai that he wished to save. Kerrigan refused to call off the attack and told Zeratul to stay out of her way. The base and its defenders were destroyed, but not before Zeratul and his allies were able to free their breathren.Ulnar  During Amon's war against the denizens of the Milky Way, Kerrigan was attacked by a hybrid reaver, which was able to gain the upperhand over her. She also encountered Artanis during the conflict. Despite the initial hostility between them, Artanis, knowing that Kerrigan was somehow important, spared her life and even helped kill another hybrid reaver that heavily wounded her in a surprise ambush. Together they progressed through the various challenges set before them in an effort to reach the shrine where the xel'naga apparently slumbered. During this time, their hostility seemed to abate somewhat. Despite the intervention of Amon's servants in the form of Moebius Corps, Taldarim and hybrid forces, the pair eventually fought their way to the shrines and then to the xel'naga chamber, where they discovered, much to Artanis' horror, that the xel'naga had all been slaughtered by Amon. She witnessed Amon reveal to Artanis that he was building a new host body for himself using the possessed Khalai he had acquired (through corrupting the Khala with his rage and malice) and the Overmind's body, forcibly merging them into a new physical form on Aiur. Kerrigan and Artanis fled the Void rift opened in the chamber, and she helped the protoss reinforcments sent by Vorazun destroy the Void crystals powering the rift, closing it. Artanis contacted her afterwards, saying that they needed to work together to stop Amon, Kerrigan regretfully told him that her forces needed time to replenish themselves, as they had suffered greatly in the recent battles, and thus could not aid the protoss. Instead she offered Artanis advice, gather allies to his cause to oppose Amon and destroy his armies piecemeal to weaken him.Allied Commanders  Kerrigan fought alongside fellow commanders against Amon's forces throughout the End War.Ascension  Two years after Artanis's reclamation of Aiur, Kerrigan had rebuilt enough of her forces to assault and kill Amon in the Void. A voice from the Void called out to her, one that she sensed was benevolent. In order to guarantee her success, Kerrigan sent a psionic call to Raynor and Artanis for military assistance, with the three leaders heading a joint Dominion/Swarm/Daelaam armada to begin the invasion. There, they found Void forces being led by Duran\u2014the combined forces were able to defeat and slay him, and free Ouros, the last xel'naga, and the one who had contacted her psionically. He told Kerrigan that he could merge his essence with hers, in a bid to defeat Amon. Despite Raynor's pleas, Kerrigan agreed to do it, hoping to atone for her past sins. As Ouros began the essence transfer needed for her to ascend into xel'naga form, Raynor, Artanis and Zagara provided military protection from the legions of Void entities and even void thrashers Amon sent against them to stop the transfer. Ultimately however, with the combined might of all three races and Kerrigan's new powers, the transfer was successful. Kerrigan willed that Zagara should take command of the Swarm from now on, telling her to \"remember our lessons\". Now xel'naga, Kerrigan headed deep into the Void to confront Amon. Here, she was supported by her allies, and her zerg. Confronting Amon, she slew him, telling Raynor in her last moments to flee.Ghosts of the Past  After the battle, Raynor found himself in Joeyray's Bar on Mar Sara, reminiscing on the past. At this point, he saw (or believed he saw) Kerrigan return, appearing as she had prior to her infestation by the zerg. Whether real or not, Kerrigan asked him whether he was ready to \"get out of here,\" to which Raynor responded positively, exiting the bar.A Queen's Legacy  Kerrigan's fate remained a mystery within the Dominion. Only a few people knew of her battle with Amon, and they remained silent. After her ascension, she granted the Zerg Swarm under Zagara with the freedom of choice, and free will among the Swarm's broodmothers. In addition, she gifted Zagara with the essence of the xel'naga, allowing her to spread life to other planets through the creation a creature independent of the Swarm made from xel'naga essence, the adostra. She had Zagara promise her that the Swarm would not assimilate the essence into its genome, a promise she would keep, but that Abathur would see as a betrayal. Years after the End War, Niadra remained loyal to Kerrigan's final directive to destroy the protoss, even though she never heard her voice again since overruning the Daelaam Ark. Niadra led her brood into conflict with the Terran Dominion and Daelaam.Game Unit StarCraft  Sarah Kerrigan appears in StarCraft in two forms: that of a terran ghost and as an infested terran.StarCraft II  Kerrigan is available as an announcer for StarCraft II multiplayer.Achievements  In StarCraft II, Sarah Kerrigan's portrait is available on battle.net for players who complete the Solo Zerg 1000 achievement. Sarah Kerrigan's portrait is available for players who complete the Liberty Completionist: Brutal achievement. Her cheerleader portrait is available upon completion of the Back to School Feat of Strength reward.Other Games  Kerrigan in her Primal Zerg form is available as a hero in Heroes of the Storm. Her ghost version appears as a color variant for Nova\u2014she was once under consideration to be a separate hero. Kerrigan's Queen of Blades persona appears as a hero unit in RISK: StarCraft. Kerrigan (in her terran ghost form) is available as a skin for Widowmaker in Overwatch, for those who log in between March 6th and April 3rd, 2018. The skin has Kerrigan's ghost designation (No. 24601). Erroneously, the unlock message for the skin calls Kerrigan \"one of the Dominion's deadliest ghosts.\"Personality and Traits Personality  Due to ghost conditioning, Kerrigan was an introvert from a young age and arguably remained aloof when freed from Confederate control. Her life as a ghost gave her \"jaded sensibilities.\" However, she never fully embraced the darker aspects of her nature. As the Queen of Blades, Kerrigan was torn emotionally, and had to 'justify' to herself what she had become. During and after the Brood War, she had moments of what could be argued to be conscience/compassion, but became colder over time. Her actions were affected by Amon's influence. The Queen of Blades was not a separate entity from Sarah Kerrigan, but they were not quite the same person either. Rather, Kerrigan in her Queen of Blades persona was Kerrigan under the influence of some devastating forces such as zerg mutagen. After her de-infestation on Char, Kerrigan was angry and conflicted, feeling like she was being pulled in many directions at once. That practically everyone in the Koprulu sector wanted her dead also affected her emotions. Indeed, she no longer possessed the hatred for life that she once did and while she was willing to be ruthless, she had a human's perspective on such actions. However, her hatred of Mengsk remained, albeit contrasted with her continued love for Raynor. Kerrigan had suffered some memory loss from her time as the Queen of Blades. Most of her memory was a blur, and of what she could recall, the images were horrible. She considered herself responsible for what she'd done as the Queen of Blades, and possessed extreme guilt for her actions. While moving against Mengsk, she demonstrated moments of compassion, such as sparing Dominion forces on Char and guilt over Lassara's death. One of the core elements of Kerrigan's personality is that of her manipulation by others, and her lack of identity. Her reversion to human form by Raynor allowed her to finally develop an identity for herself, though found her emotions torn between a man that she loved (Raynor) and a man that she despised (Mengsk).Psionics  Sarah Kerrigan was an extremely powerful terran psychic. At a young age she fried her mother's brain accidentally with psionic powers and demonstrated telekinetic abilities. Indeed, her powers were so strong it forced a readjustment of the psionic measurement scale. Her powers were then rated at PI 10, making her the most powerful ghost on record. Her powers were reduced by both ghost conditioning and a neuro-adjuster but after the device's removal, she was powerful enough to throw Major Rumm around with telekinesis and fry his brain. Kerrigan was uniquely suited to controlling zerg even before she was infested. In experiments conducted with captured zerg specimens, the Confederacy terminated the other ghosts involved in the project because only Kerrigan could get the results they wanted. Following deinfestation during the Second Great War, she retained the ability to control zerg. Kerrigan's gene pattern enabled her retention of intelligence upon infestation. Prior to deinfestation during the Second Great War, she was at least an order of magnitude more powerful than PI level 10, possessing a \"class 12 psi signature\". After becoming a terran/primal zerg hybrid, her psionic power exceeded, and could not be measured by, the PI scale. Upon the transfer of Ouros's essence, Kerrigan gained immense psionic might, able to wield celestial energy as a cohesive beam and send it out as a wave of energy.Tactics  Kerrigan was a Confederate ghost and underwent the usual harsh ghost training. She was especially good at using knives, firearms, and driving vultures, and was skilled enough in martial arts to kill a terran officer by kicking him hard enough to break his neck. Kerrigan has also demonstrated competence in the areas of deception and strategy. When working with Duran, she often relied on him to come up with strategies, but was more than capable of creating her own complex plans. As the Queen of Blades, she was able to spin zerg DNA strands/sequences into her own creations.Zerg Abilities  Sarah Kerrigan was infested by the zerg as part of an experiment. Her new appearance was personally designed by Abathur, though the process was painful. The transformation occurred within a chrysalis and was completed on Char. Her stature increased, and she gained an armored carapace, claws, and \"wings\" usable as weapons and effective against psi-blades. Kerrigan was also able to cloak, despite no longer wearing a ghost's hostile environment suit. Unlike most infested terrans, Kerrigan retained her intelligence and at least some part of her personality. Her DNA also received telomeric additions. Kerrigan's full psionic potential was initially suppressed by residual ghost conditioning. Upon reversing the process, she gained enough psionic power to create psionic storms and could even sense the protoss hiding on Char. However, she was still not in full command of her powers, as she was unaware that she was giving Raynor a direct link to the zerg hive mind through the psychic link she had with him. By the time the first Overmind had been slain, Kerrigan was powerful enough to gain control of approximately half of the Zerg Swarm and seize the mind of Raszagal without even setting foot on the same planet. Upon the end of the Brood War, Kerrigan no longer needed cerebrates to help her control the zerg. By the Second Great War, Kerrigan had gained a psionic implosion ability. She also had very swift regeneration; a wing severed by Zeratul on Ulaan regrew in seconds. By this time, Kerrigan was the most powerful psionic in the universe, powerful enough to hold her own against 27 siege tanks. After gaining Zerus's powers via the first spawning pool, Kerrigan was even stronger than when she was as the Queen of Blades. Her psionic powers continued to develop and the \"boundless fury\" of the primal zerg allowed her to leap through the air and strike at targets with terrible force. As the primal Queen of Blades, her psionic might was unrivaled by any being.Notes Character Development  Chris Metzen has described Kerrigan as (alongside Jim Raynor) the \"loneliest person in the universe.\" In his mind, the possibility of her redemption and her rocky relationship with Raynor makes up the heart of the StarCraft universe. He has also hinted that Raynor's relationship with Kerrigan is drawn from personal experience, in regards to a man struggling with his own demons while saving a woman from her own.Brian T. Kindregan considers her to be the most complex character of the StarCraft setting.Valerie Watrous has cited Kerrigan as being her favorite character in the setting.StarCraft  Despite her important role in the StarCraft storyline, the character of Sarah Kerrigan was not conceived until the middle of work on the first campaign of the original game. The developers wanted a \"commando character\" in the game, but hadn't decided on a name. She was initially a \"thrown in\" character named after figure skater Nancy Kerrigan, as a nod to her rival Tonya Harding. This was in turn a reference to the character of Tanya from Command and Conquer, which was seen as a rival to StarCraft. Kerrigan was given the role of a covert physic warrior. Metzen further worked on her character and fleshed out her relationship with Raynor. As her character was being discussed, it appeared that her role as a character was having more bearing than previously imagined, courtesy of her position between Mengsk and Raynor. Likewise, her subsequent infestation was a late development decision. She was not initially concieved of as a villain, but the idea to have Kerrigan captured or killed arose in order to give \"some loss for the hero\" (Jim Raynor). The idea for Kerrigan's infestation came while working on the zerg campaign (this was about midway through development), as it needed a human-like character, as the zerg didn't have a lot of characters they could personify. Metzen came up with the idea of infesting Kerrigan at the end of the terran campaign, so as to allow this human lens to see the zerg. Kerrigan's role was expanded upon for StarCraft: Brood War, in which she became the primary antagonist. In the first game, Kerrigan (in both her forms) was voiced by Glynnis Talken-Campbell. She has described Kerrigan as being harder to voice than the medic (which she also provided the voice for) due to the role requiring her to \"bring out her inner warrior.\"StarCraft II  With StarCraft II, Kerrigan's design was established by Blizzard's cinematic department, and while the game design team was allowed a degree of latitude with how she'd be portrayed in the game engine, the design had to remain faithful to the high-resolution version. In-game, her athletic proportions were very subdued when viewed from a distance, and her feminine features did not stand out enough to clearly present her as a female character. A quick resolution to this for the real-time artwork was increasing Kerrigan\u2019s breast size and the width of her hips. A drawback of the design was the zerg-arms that protrude from Kerrigan\u2019s back which interfere with her silhouette and distracts from her slim waist. Creating the in-game version of Kerrigan was a balancing act between readable, overbuilt proportions while maintaining strong feminine features. The in-game model was reiterated numerous times to get the balance right. Kerrigan's de-infested form in Heart of the Swarm had similarly exagerated features in the game engine to help her stand out. Her primal form in the game was based on the Wings of Liberty model, but was slightly tweaked with some new texture work and slight geometry adjustments. Campbell initially voiced Kerrigan in the game. However, a new voice director at Blizzard replaced her with Tricia Helfer, and the lines were re-recorded. It was speculated that Kerrigan (at least during Heart of the Swarm) has two personalities, one as Sarah Kerrigan, the other as the Queen of Blades. Brian Kindregan speculated in an interview that if Kerrigan's Queen of Blades persona still remained after her de-infestation at the end of Wings of Liberty, it would end up taking over. What is known is that the original concept for Kerrigan's storyline in Heart of the Swarm was that she would slowly revert to her zerg state over time, her hostile environment suit deteriorating to reveal her re-emerging zerg characteristics. The idea was that by using her powers, the zerg side of her would start to show (whether she liked it or not). This was represented in initial game models and various pieces of concept art. However, the visual evolution was downplayed since it slowly took the edge of her climactic return to power, and all the evolution models were shelved. Additionally, during a previous version of Heart of the Swarm, Kerrigan was interested in creating a \"metamorph\", a breed which could guide its own evolution. The development team initially wanted Kerrigan's \"primal zerg\" model to be wildly different from her Queen of Blades form. However, the cinematic team did not have sufficient time to redesign Kerrigan with so many cutscenes propelling the story, and the need to synchronize with the cutscene teams means that such a wild redesign was impossible. According to Kerrigan's StarCraft II hero page, it was Amon who ordered her to retrieve the xel'naga device. This is in contrast to comments made at BlizzCon 2011, where her motives were established as seeking the artifact as part of her own volition, as well as comments in Heart of the Swarm, where she establishes that Amon never directly controlled her. Kerrigan's redemption arc was not planned by Chris Metzen during the development of StarCraft. Similarly, Brood War \"wasn't the place for it\" in his mind. Between Brood War and StarCraft II however, Metzen's opinion on Kerrigan and villains as a whole began to change, as the idea of villain redemption became a concept close to him. He reasoned that the Queen of Blades was not who Kerrigan truly was, that she had always been manipulated by one power or another. The exploration of this idea ran through the three installments of the StarCraft II trilogy.Other Appearances Merchandise Other Zerg  The Zerg Swarm is a terrifying and ruthless amalgamation of biologically advanced, arthropodal aliens. Dedicated to the pursuit of genetic perfection, the zerg relentlessly hunt down and assimilate advanced species across the galaxy, incorporating useful genetic code into their own. They are named \"the Swarm\" per their ability to rapidly create strains, and the relentless assaults they employ to overwhelm their foes. Alongside the protoss and terrans, the zerg stand as one of the three dominant species of the Milky Way and are universally feared, hated and hunted as such. The Swarm in itself makes up a third of the power of the Koprulu Sector. Zerg remain in areas of the galaxy outside the Koprulu sector.History Creation of the Swarm  Amon's xel'naga discovered the original zerg on Zerus. The fallen xel'naga directly intervened in the zerg's development to gift them with the purity of essence, making them the counterparts of the protoss, gifted with the purity of form; the zerg and protoss were intended to eventually merge to form a hybrid army for Amon. At this point the zerg species diverged into two distinct branches; the Zerg Swarm that had been altered and the primal zerg that managed to avoid the tampering of Amon's xel'naga. The xel'naga created the Overmind to control the zerg swarm and prevent a repeat of the protoss' Aeon of Strife. The Overmind oversaw the zerg swarm's rapid evolution, created the cerebrates, and divided the Swarm into broods. The primal zerg, meanwhile, went into hiding to preserve their individuality. However, the xel'naga in Ulnar caught wind of Amon's plan, and sought to stop Amon from ending the Infinite Cycle. The two factions fought in the space above Zerus, and the swarm was released on the xel'naga. Most were slain and their knowledge was assimilated by the swarm. Through this, the Overmind became aware of the existence of the protoss, and through them sought to make the Zerg Swarm perfect. However, it was aware of the directive implanted into it by Amon, and sought ways to subvert Amon's plans.The Great War  Having assimilated multiple species and evolved during the journey, the Swarm arrived at the Koprulu sector near the Protoss Empire. The Overmind ordered the assimilation of the terrans; their psionic potential was needed to fight the protoss. The protoss detected the zerg, learned of their xel'naga origins, and dispatched the Koprulu Expeditionary Force under Executor Tassadar to deny the zerg a foothold. The Great War broke out with the zerg invasion of the terran worlds. Protoss purification, and terran internal strife, failed to contain the invasion. The terran rebel group, the Sons of Korhal, used and manipulated the invasion to overthrow the Terran Confederacy and form the Terran Dominion. The zerg captured Sarah Kerrigan at the Battle of Tarsonis and withdrew to Char to transform her into the Queen of Blades. The Overmind intended Kerrigan to succeed it as the Swarm's leader, freeing the zerg from Amon. It had no concern over the other races of the galaxy. The zerg were attacked on Char by the protoss; a renegade Tassadar joined forces with Dark Prelate Zeratul on Char. Zeratul, wielding the Dark Templar's power of the Void, permanently slew Zasz. This created a brief mental link between Zeratul and the Overmind, through which the Overmind learned the exact location of Aiur. Kerrigan remained on Char while the Swarm invaded Aiur. Resistance against the zerg invasion was hampered by the protoss Conclave's overconfidence and a short protoss civil war. The planet was devastated. The Overmind relocated to Aiur, where it was slain by the protoss. The protoss subsequently withdrew to Shakuras, the Dark Templar homeworld.The Brood War  The Overmind's death left the Swarm divided between the cerebrate Daggoth and Kerrigan. Daggoth initiated creation of the second Overmind. Kerrigan sought to kill the Overmind before it could mature and resume control over the entire Swarm and her. The zerg civil war was complicated by the arrival of the United Earth Directorate Expeditionary Fleet in the Koprulu sector; the UED overthrew the Terran Dominion, and captured the second Overmind with the intent of using the zerg to maintain control over the Sector. The UED used the psi disrupter to fragment opposing zerg. Kerrigan manipulated both anti-UED terrans and the protoss to destroy the Psi Disrupter, break UED control over the sector, and slay the Overmind, thus bringing the entire Swarm under her control. Zerg betrayal dissolved the alliances of convenience. The reformed Terran Dominion, UED remnants, and protoss attempted, and failed, to oust Kerrigan. The war ended with all sides withdrawing to rebuild; the zerg remained in control of previously infested worlds.Interbellum  For the next four years, the Swarm avoided outright conflict with the terrans and protoss while slowly expanding and evolving. The remaining cerebrates died and were replaced by broodmothers. As the first hybrids became active, signs of Amon's machinations reached Kerrigan. While searching for clues about the hybrids, Zeratul discovered Kerrigan was essential to prevent the Swarm from fulfilling the Dark Voice's apocalyptic plans; the dark templar instructed Jim Raynor, of Raynor's Raiders, to ensure Kerrigan's survival.The Second Great War  The Second Great War began with the Swarm's invasion of terran space in search of a xel'naga device. Various terran groups used the upheaval to their own ends. Raynor's Raiders fomented rebellion against the Terran Dominion and, on behalf of Crown Prince Valerian Mengsk's Moebius Foundation, recovered the device before the Swarm. A joint Raiders and Dominion attacked Char and used the device to deinfest Kerrigan. The Swarm fragmented. Kerrigan was doggedly pursued by the Dominion, which led to Raynor's capture and reported execution by the Dominion. Kerrigan began reuniting the Swarm as a tool for vengeance, both for herself and for Raynor. During this period, the Swarm journeyed to Zerus, where it was reunited with the primal zerg and Kerrigan became a primal zerg-human hybrid. Her new form was more powerful than the previous hybridization, and free of Amon's influence. The Swarm discovered and destroyed a secret Dominion hybrid production facility led by Doctor Emil Narud, a servant of Amon. Kerrigan killed Narud, and learned of Amon's resurrection and the threat he posed to creation. She directed the Swarm to wage war against Amon after killing Mengsk. The campaign against the Dominion was a success. Raynor was found alive and rescued from a secret prison. The Swarm invaded Korhal, and Kerrigan personally entered the Korhal Palace and slew Emperor Arcturus Mengsk. The Swarm departed Korhal to fight Amon.The End War  Zerg under Kerrigan's command assaulted a Moebius Foundation base whose personnel had come under the thrall of hybrids. It was successfully destroyed. Afterwards Kerrigan sent the zerg toward Ulnar, but were engaged by Amon's hybrid. During the Reclamation of Aiur, the Daelaam fought what it thought was feral zerg on the surface of Aiur. However, these had fallen under the control of Amon's hybrid, and used tactics against the Daelaam. As Amon rose and corrupted the Khala, Amon Brood pushed Hierarch Artanis's few remaining loyalists with the help of the hybrid and corrupted Khalai, forcing him to leave Aiur on the Spear of Adun. Amon then reactivated the warp gate linking Aiur to Shakuras, and sent billions of zerg to Shakuras. The Daelaam evacuated what population they could, but the planet had been infested. In a last ditch move, Matriarch Vorazun ordered the xel'naga temple's phase prism overloaded, destroying Shakuras and all zerg on the surface. Kerrigan's swarm continued to battle at Ulnar, and were met with the Daelaam who helped her push into the Temple of Unification. They broke through Moebius Corps, Tal'darim and hybrid forces to get to the central chamber, but found the xel'naga inside dead. Amon revealed his trap, and opened a void portal.  The Zerg Swarm and Daelaam allied to destroy the void crystals powering the portal, but in the process Kerrigan's swarm took heavy casualties. The Daelaam once again came into conflict with Amon's zerg on the planet Endion, where the zerg infested the surface. The Daelaam pushed through their hives to activate the stasis locks keeping the Purifier station of Cybros in orbit, eventually clearing the hives. However then the stasis lock fell Amon's zerg and hybrid descended on Cybros, and began to attempt to destroy the station's power core. However, the Daelaam activated the Purifiers, who cleansed the zerg from the platform, then purified the surface of Endion of all life, destroying the zerg infestation on the surface. Upon the Daelaam's return to Aiur, Amon's zerg made up the bulk of the defenses. They had infested Antioch and fought to defend the khaydarin crystal that powered the psionic matrix there, but were beaten back by Matriarch Vorazun and Highlord Alarak. The zerg brought up heavy defenses for the last crystal as well, but a combined Daelaam force lead by Hierarch Artanis cut through them and destroyed the crystal. Amon's zerg served as part of his defensive line defending his host body, alongside shadows of the Void and corrupted Khalai protoss. These were no match for the Daelaam, who destroyed the host body. Amon's brood then converged on the Daelaam as they prepared the Keystone to pull Amon from the Khala, but even with the aid of the Golden Armada could not destroy the Keystone in time. Amon was pushed from the material universe, and the broods on Aiur were out of his control. In spite of their weakened state, Kerrigan's Swarm was able to mobilize throughout the End War against Amon, winning several key victories under the leadership of Sarah Kerrigan, Zagara, Abathur, Alexei Stukov and Dehaka.Into the Void  On Ulnar, Kerrigan had managed to rebuild her broods, and sensed a benevolent voice calling to her from the Void. She gathered together the Terran Dominion and the Daelaam, and the three factions pushed into the Void to end Amon and find out what voice was calling to them. They used the void portal in Ulnar to go into the Void, but were attacked by shadows of the Void. They kept on the trail of the voice, and found it to be of Tassadar, who was imprisoned by Narud. Kerrigan and Alexei Stukov lead the zerg in the offense against Narud and his Void forces, and with the help of the Dominion and Daelaam pushed to Narud and weakened him. Stukov personally delivered the killing blow as revenge for killing him years earlier. Tassadar's voice revealed himself to be of Ouros, one of the last xel'naga, who said Kerrigan needed to ascend to a xel'naga in order to continue the Infinite Cycle and beat Amon. Kerrigan began the process of absorbing Ouros's essence, but Amon sent shadows and void thrashers to stop the process. Zagara lead the swarm in the defense of their queen, and were aided by Jim Raynor and Artanis. The transfer of essence was completed, and Kerrigan ascended to become a xel'naga. She stated that Zagara was now in charge of the swarm, and that she needed to remember the lessons Kerrigan had taught her. Kerrigan took her broods and directly engaged Amon, supported by the Terran Dominion and Daelaam. Her swarm destroyed the void crystals shielding him, and Kerrigan delivered the killing blow against Amon. With Amon's fall, the swarm returned to the Koprulu Sector.A New Queen  By 2508, the Zerg Swarm was unified under Broodmother Zagara. This year, a ceasefire was declared between the Swarm, the Daelaam, and the Dominion. She forcibly laid claim to Char and all of the surrounding worlds, bringing the ceasefire into question. Before Kerrigan departed from the swarm, she gave Zagara two gifts, one was the ability to choose the zerg's fate for themselves, to potentially lead them away from their warlike ways. The second was the location of creature that could house xel'naga essence. Zagara had what essence she could gathered from Ulnar, but there was only a limited amount. At some point, the zerg attacked a Umojan Protectorate expedition to Jarban Minor, infesting most of the research team. Years later a terran separatist group known as the Defenders of Man began planting psi-emitters on Dominion planets, prompting feral zerg to attack. The feral zerg struck Antiga Prime first, then the colony of Bountiful. Emperor Valerian Mengsk affirmed to his people that the Dominion was not at war with the Zerg Swarm. Each time, the Defenders of Man would arrive to repel the zerg, as a motion to show how weak the Dominion was in the face of an alien invasion. Psi-emitters were planted on Borea, and the Dominion was forced to evacuate. Finally, the feral zerg struck Tyrador IX in number when several psi-emitters were planted, but were attacked by the Tal'darim Death Fleet. After the Dominion defeated the Tal'darim, the Defenders of Man fleet sent to rescue the civilians defeated the feral zerg. By 2512, Zagara's experiments with fusing zerg and xel'naga essence had seen fruition. Under the direction of Abathur, the swarm created the adostra, a creature that could generate life on planets passively as the xel'naga did. Abathur however despised these creatures, and Zagara's peaceful stance, which he saw as contradictory to the Swarm's purpose of domination. In response, Abathur siphoned off some of the xel'naga essence, and instead made a breed named the chitha, zerg that could be verbally commanded and had a strong psionic presence that could disrupt communication and other psionic beings. He modified a queen named Mukav, and brought her to his side, and set about his plot to spark a new war. Zagara used the adostra to regenerate the planet of Gystt, which had been purified in the Great War. The adostra turned the planet into a vibrant jungle, fresh with life. Soon the Daelaam arrived, seeking to purify the planet, so Zagara sent a message to Emperor Valerian Mengsk of the Terran Dominion asking for aid. He arrived, and she extended a hand of diplomacy, saying the Swarm had changed and that she would be willing to help the ailing factions rebuild their planets as she had Gystt. Though skeptical, Artanis and Valerian agreed to meet with her as long as they could survey the planet. However, Abathur soon put his plans into motion, using his chitha to force the terrans and protoss to destroy two of the three adostra nests, hoping to respark hostilities. This enraged Zagara, but the three factions were able to intervene before the last nest was destroyed, hold off the chitha, and discover Abathur's plot. Zagara and the survey team slew Mukav and the remaining chitha, and incapacitated Abathur. Zagara refused to kill Abathur, but said he would be kept in a place where he could do no more harm. With the One-Day War resolved and true war adverted, peace talks began between the three factions, with the Swarm offering to aid in reconstruction efforts if they Daelaam and Dominion provided aid for them as well. Gystt would become Zagara's hive world not long after. During the Battle of Adena, the renegade broodmother Niadra revealed herself yet again, ambushing a terran group to gain enough biomass for her true purpose given by Kerrigan years ago: to destroy the protoss. The resulting skirmish killed many protoss and terrans, though Niadra's true prize, a terran psionic named Elms, escaped the planet. Meanwhile, on Gystt, Zagara sensed the appearance of Niadra, and pondered what it meant for the sector.Characteristics  A great deal of information has been ascertained as to the nature of zerg physiology and psychology, such as through the Terran Confederacy's Project Bellwood, and the Terran Dominion's Project Blackstone. All zerg breeds are efficient killers and/or possess abilities that will aid the Swarm in the destruction of its enemies.Physiology  The primal zerg maintain the genome of the zerg species before the creation of the Overmind. After this, when the zerg deviated from their primal counterparts, the Swarm reduced their physical appearance to essential fighting components. They excel in proliferation, per their high rate of reproduction. The zerg as a whole are extremely tough, tenacious, and deadly. Their natural armor and weaponry is comparable to modern technology in terms of toughness and armor-piercing capabilities. One-on-one, zerg are not as strong as their terran and protoss counterparts. The zerg are extremely resistant to chemical agents, but their biological nature still renders them vulnerable to concentrated radiation, such as sigma radiation. All zerg strains are capable of operating in a variety of environments, and some can operate in the vacuum of space. Most zerg are not adapted for space travel by themselves, but are carried by larger zerg such as leviathans. Space-borne zerg either have vast stores of oxygen or have been adapted to not require it, while terrestrial strains are much less dependent on oxygen than other organic creatures, and take a very long time to suffocate. Zerg must eat and rest, but do not require extended hours of sleep and have no set periods of inactivity. Left unchecked, zerg multiply at an alarming rate. Zerg strains gain nutrients from creep, but can consume other animals for nourishment if the situation demands it. Zerg do not die of old age. Most zerg ground strains are also capable of burrowing and digging through virtually any surface, using groups of tiny muscles that vibrate at a low frequency and grind dirt and stone along their way, allowing them to \"swim through the ground\". This ability made them extremely deadly in ambush situations, as many terran or protoss forces suffered losses when suddenly being surrounded by a mass of enemy zerg units. All zerg ground strains move faster on creep than they do on normal ground due to microscopic filaments within the substance that allow them to 'skate' over it. In a protracted fight, one of the Swarm's greatest battlefield advantages is their underground rapid transit system which they can excavate with amazing speed. During the Great War and Brood War, this was provided for by the nydus canal. As of the Second Great War, this has been supplanted by nydus worms, spawned by the nydus network. Zerg possess remarkable regenerative capabilities. Their alpha amino acids possess unique R groups that allow dead cell matter to be combined with normal proteins to create new cells. Under normal circumstances, zerg may regenerate indefinitely; a radically changing cell structure is a by-product of the process, as well as high quantity of energy in the process. Given time, even a gravely wounded zerg will return to full health. Thus, a zerg colony remains viable if even one creature or structure survives. Few zerg survive for more than a few minutes in a given battle, but those that do evolve during the battle itself, becoming more powerful every hour. The zerg constantly study their enemies and adapt accordingly. Zerg structures have the ability to adapt while under fire, hardening their outer shell with bony plates when under fire in order to ensure its survival. Zerg structures are essentially giant organs and draw sustenance from creep, a thick carpet-like substance that integrates a colony's structures as one macro-organism.Compound B-5801 provides their structural basis. The zerg are obsessed with detecting subtler motions and more advanced camuflauge techniques.Genetics  Before hatching, a zerg specimen has two cell types in general: Type A creates random different mutations, while B cells hunt the new mutations. Upon hatching, the specimen of a certain strain is a result of the Darwin's theory of evolution on a cellular level; it is made of the strongest cell mutations that survived. Like terrans and protoss, zerg genetic material consists of DNA, seemingly in the shape of a double helix. However, when a zerg strain's DNA evolves, it becomes less flexible. Apart from the overlord, every zerg strain ever encountered by terrans has been a custom mix of DNA, to the extent that no non-overlord strain bears much genetic resemblance to the organism(s) that spawned it. Dr. Talen Ayers theorized that the zerg are unwilling to too deeply alter the genetic makeup of organisms with psionic potential, as even the slightest of genetic changes can remove said potential. This would, in his mind, explain the genetic similarities in this case. The zerg like to pit themselves against harsh climates, using a planet's harsh conditions to further their own evolution. In regards to assimilating the genetic material of other species, the zerg were initially very selective, assimilating only strong species at the top of their food chains and eradicating 'lesser species' lest they corrupt the purity of the zerg genome. Under Kerrigan, the situation changed, and the zerg were willing to assimilate any material they came across. The zerg genetic landscape is constantly changing, to the extent where using terms such as \"mutant\" (mutation being a permanant change to an organism's genetic code) can be considered to be a misnomer. Zerg DNA is \"antithetical\" to protoss DNA and they cannot infest protoss under normal conditions. In addition, protoss psionic powers (Khala and Void) protect the protoss. The protoss are the only known species that the zerg have failed to assimilate. However, their DNA can be artificially combined, creating hybrids. Hyper-rare mutant strains exist within the zerg gene pool.Psychology  It has been difficult for observers to determine the full extent of the zerg intelligence, but it is clear that they are a very cunning species, and they are capable of higher reasoning. Although they do not utilize technology, they demonstrate a clear understanding of it, and have been known to open airlocks and doorways in colonies that they have raided. As a group they also react intelligently to attacks and are adept at tactical combat. On an individual basis, though, the zerg seem to be hardly more than savage animals with little or no concern for self-preservation, exhibiting no initiative. Evolution is directed by \"Alpha Zerg\" strains, such as cerebrates and queens. Dr. Talise Cogan voiced the idea that the zerg, as a whole, can be considered to be a macro-organism. The zerg can be considered to be a \"slave race\" to whatever entity controls them. As a united body, zerg have been known to execute advanced combat tactics, setting up ambushes using burrowed units to disguise their ranks, or using layered defensive lines like the infamous Juno lines to draw out armored columns. Generally, communication between members of the Swarm is done through psionics, although higher command strains are able to process and understand vocal commands. After the End War, vocal and non-psionic communication became more commonly used by the Zerg Swarm. For the zerg, success on the battlefield comes down to overwhelming numbers and great mobility. For them, war is simply survival of the fittest. It is deemed mission critical by the Terran Dominion that zerg spawning centers be targeted as soon as tactically possible, for while the zerg can multiply at an alarming rate, their production of strains is centralized. Hence, the zerg will protect their hatcheries with fanatical zeal. The quest for perfection is rooted deep within the zerg psyche, and is a pseudo-religious concept for them. The core idea of this 'religion' is that there is a state that the zerg can reach where they would no longer need to evolve, that their evolutionary form would never have to change again because they could already adapt to any situation. Zerg have the ability to sense psychic power and, being sensitive to it, often respond to it (to the point of rendering themselves temporarily out of the control of a leader) and seek it out. This ability has a greater range than that of wranglers, weakly psychic terrans employed to find other psychics. In the rare cases the zerg's hive mind does communicate by a means terrans understand, they often refer to themselves as the \"We.\" Those undergoing infestation are beckoned to be brought into their collective, welcoming them as the \"Us.\"Control  The amount of control exerted over a zerg force also impacts on their intelligence. Without this control, the zerg will become little more than animals, attacking everything on sight, at times, even their own kind. These zerg are referred to as feral zerg and can generally only operate at the lowest level. In contrast, primal zerg are individuals, with no links to a hivemind. During the Brood War, the Queen of Blades became the uncontested leader of the Swarm. However, creating sapient lieutenants such as broodmothers extended her control over the Swarm even further. Zerg can be \"lobotomized\" to lose contact with the Zerg Swarm. The Terran Dominion conducted this experiment as early as 2500, using zerglings to seek psychic terrans.Warp Travel  The zerg are able to create rifts into warp space to transport themselves at faster-than-light speeds. These rifts have been utilized multiple times.Worlds  The zerg have demonstrated an ability to storm worlds, but are less well-equipped at holding them. After the Brood War, the Swarm pulled back to Char, but could have easily expanded to cover numerous worlds again. Over 100 worlds have been infested by the zerg. The following is a list of planets and moons that have been conquered by the Swarm, if only temporarily:Gameplay General Notes  The zerg as a whole use large numbers of fast, weaker units that can be built or rebuilt quickly as long as they can establish a good starting economy, which can be one of their toughest challenges. They excel at attacking but are much weaker at defense than the protoss and terran factions. Gameplay with and against the zerg revolves heavily around their economy; if playing as them one needs to aggressively grow their economy faster than the enemy, and conversely when fighting the zerg one should either grow their own economy quickly to keep up or hamper the opponent's as much as possible.StarCraft StarCraft: Ghost StarCraft II Notes Design Process  According to Samwise Didier, the zerg design process can be summed up as follows:StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty  Wings of Liberty is the name of the StarCraft II terran campaign and episode. It was released on July 27, 2010. It was the first StarCraft II product and was released separately from the two expansions, Heart of the Swarm and Legacy of the Void, occurring before them chronologically. Wings of Liberty has 29 missions (though a maximum of 26 are playable in a single playthrough). It has 13 minutes of pre-rendered cinematics and 32 minutes of in-engine on-the-fly cinematics. It has been collected into a battlechest alongside Heart of the Swarm. As of November 2017, Wings of Liberty will be free to play for all players.Campaign Campaign Overview  The terran campaign focused on Raynor's Raiders, which had become a mercenary force based in the Hyperion. The campaign started at Mar Sara, site of the start of the original StarCraft. Jim Raynor is \"the central hero and character of the campaign,\" which focuses on his fight against the Terran Dominion as well as his relationship with Sarah Kerrigan. Raynor's forces were out of money and morale, but Raynor had been trying to reverse this by acquiring alien artifacts and selling them to the mysterious Moebius Foundation.Mechanics  The campaign is expected to take 20-60 hours to complete, depending on how \"completist\" the player is. In the terran campaign, players could choose their own missions in the middle of the campaign rather than progress through a set series. The missions are designed to emphasize player choice, such as which technology to buy and which missions to play. The choices will be made obvious, and affect the fate of some characters. Mission and cinematic replays can be viewed and data displayed. Missions can even be played again in order to get achievements. All missions except the final Char missions, the prophecy missions and the secret mission add a new unit to the arsenal. The mission is generally tailored to be challenging when using the new unit. Delaying a mission to expand the arsenal by playing other missions first can alleviate much of that difficulty.Character Interactions  Jim Raynor is the main character, and the player will direct him, determining to some extent who Raynor will become based on their choices. This is different from the \"vague\" player character from StarCraft. The player will have the choice of bending Raynor's path in life (by taking missions from certain characters such as Ariel Hanson compared to taking missions from characters such as Tychus Findlay and Gabriel Tosh). Interactions in briefings also changed, as Jim Raynor can interact with those around him (e.g. he can walk around the Hyperion or talk to characters like Tychus Findlay and his second-in-command Matt Horner. The player can choose which characters to interact with. Often missions are associated with different characters. For instance, Jim Raynor can choose between allying with Gabriel Tosh or Nova. If the former mission is concluded, Raynor's Raiders can create spectres and Tosh remains on his team. If the latter mission is chosen, Raynor's Raiders can create ghosts and Nova kills Tosh.Sets  Numerous between-mission set pieces exist, such as the bar on Mar Sara where Tychus Findlay was reunited with Jim Raynor, and includes features such as a jukebox (which enables music to be turned on or off), a bulletin board containing useful information (such as wanted posters) and nostalgic pieces (such as a picture of Raynor and Findlay in the Heaven's Devils), and a TV set which showed newscasts informing Raynor about events affecting the Terran Dominion.Hyperion Sets Armory  The Hyperion's armory is the favored hangout of engineer Rory Swann. It also contains a simulator to test new units. In StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty, players can buy new upgrades here. Players can \"customize\" their selections which suit their playstyles, for instance buying defensive upgrades for bunkers would suit a defensive playstyle. When a new upgrade is bought, a short video of the unit or ability is shown.Bridge  The bridge of the Hyperion is where mission briefings take place. Matt Horner is usually stationed here. The Battle Report screen allows missions to be replayed. Alternate missions can be played and although doing so will not affect the plot of a particular run through of Wings of Liberty, the missions' achievements can be earned, and credit for doing them (for achievements that have you complete all 29 missions) are also earned. Battle Reports of each mission are generated with stats ranging from SCV count to the actual build order.Cantina  The ship houses an on-board cantina, where Jim Raynor has been known to drink. The cantina features TV sets (to watch the news) and a jukebox stolen from a bar on Mar Sara. Newly-introduced characters often congregate here, news reports can be watched and decorations for completing a particular arc of the campaign (such as the UNN plaque Findlay took after Media Blitz, or the banner given to Raynor by the Haven colonists after Safe Haven) can be viewed above the door. The game Lost Viking can be played here.Lab  The laboratory provides upgrades and additional units in campaign mode. There are two research trees: zerg and protoss. Progression up the zerg tree is through accumulating zerg research points in missions, with protoss research points being applied to the protoss tree. Collecting points and advancing up the trees are a type of quest. Points are applied to the tree cumulatively; points are not expended like credits. A tree level is unlocked for every five points accumulated. Each level has two upgrades/unit options, but only one may be chosen. An option must be chosen at each level for the tree to progress. Once a tree has reached 25 points there are no further upgrades or units. Points beyond the 25 may be sold to the Moebius Foundation for 10,000 credits each. Dr. Ariel Hanson and Egon Stetmann spend their time in the lab.Unit and Upgrade Availability  Units will become available in the campaign through missions. The player can also gain access to upgrades for them which are purchased outside actual missions in the Hyperion armory. Players will be able to \"customize\" their selections which suit their playstyles, for instance buying defensive upgrades for bunkers would suit a defensive playstyle. In addition, other upgrades that will never be seen in multiplayer, such as area-of-effect increases or the ability to add both a tech lab and a reactor to a barracks will be included in the system. Most missions completed gives access to a unit or upgrade to a unit. Each unit has two upgrades. There are only enough credits to purchase approximately 80% of upgrades in the campaign. Raynor's Raiders will have access to some older technology, such as Wraiths, goliaths and medics.Protoss Mini-Campaign  Wings of Liberty includes a protoss mini-campaign which must be unlocked. It consists of a series of missions, and includes other protoss forces. The mini-campaign is not separate from the main terran campaign; rather, there are missions where the player plays as protoss. The mini-campaign is presented as a flashback of Zeratul's actions.Mission Types  The mission types are varied; early missions are focused on acquiring credits and equipment, such as Liberation Day and The Outlaws. One mission consists of a series of train robberies (The Great Train Robbery). The third mission is a hold-out mission. Other missions include one where lava rises every five minutes, killing anything that isn't on high ground (The Devil's Playground); a mission where infested terrans emerge at night and force the player into a hold-out situation, but they become dormant during the day, during which the player tries to kill as many as possible (Outbreak); a mission where there is a invincible mothership and the player has to destroy the nexii powering its shield before it destroys all colonist outposts (Safe Haven); a mission where opposing terran and zerg forces seek to steal an alien artifact from within a hostile protoss fanatics base (Smash and Grab); a mission in which a lone \"ghost\" must influence a battle (Breakout & Ghost of a Chance); a mission on a xel'naga worldship where rip-field generators damages units (Maw of the Void), a mission on a scrap planet where the player has to compete with a mercenary to achieve a quota of 6000 minerals, scrap having to be collected (Cutthroat), the \"Thor\" missions (Engine of Destruction and Media Blitz) and one mission will have walls of fire burn across the map and the player must complete the mission before being consumed by a nearby supernova (Supernova). The mission design of the game was based on how Wings of Liberty was a story of \"one man and a group of rebels,\" and were designed to show how Raynor was in over his head, yet could pull off miracles even in the midst of zerg invasions.Storyline  Note: The storyline of Wings of Liberty contains branches, some of which are mutually exclusive. Information has been grouped by missions lines, but some overlap can still occur at the player's discretion.Mar Sara  After nine years of being a convict, Tychus Findlay was released from cryo-prison, but not without a price. Meanwhile, rebel leader Jim Raynor was present on Mar Sara, fighting against a Terran Dominion takeover of a local colony. Traveling back to Joeyray's Bar, he met up with Tychus Findlay, who was an old friend of his. Findlay offered Raynor a business proposal; \"liberating\" alien artifacts from the Terran Dominion. The Dominion had recently prohibited transportation of such artifacts, and had begun excavating them on planets such as Mar Sara. The artifacts would be sold to his contact, the formerly legitimate Moebius Foundation. Raynor and Findlay's forces teamed up to steal one such artifact from the Dominion. The zerg invaded Mar Sara en masse, starting at the location of the dig. The Raiders defended a town until the Hyperion could rescue them. The zerg had, in fact, struck many Dominion worlds. Afterward, Raynor had the choices of rescuing the colonists of Agria and retrieving an artifact from protoss fanatics at Monlyth.Tal'darim Troubles  On Monlyth, the Raiders had to contend with both the Tal'darim, a fanatical protoss splinter faction, and Kerrigan's zerg. They performed a quick smash and grab mission, wrestling the artifact and escaping before Kerrigan could arrive...but not before she could taunt Raynor. Afterwards, Findlay familiarized himself with the Queen of Blades via the Hyperion's archive, much to Matt Horner's irritation at the lack of permission granted for such access. Findlay saw Kerrigan as a threat to be dealt with. Horner however, was more sensitive and aware of Raynor's past with the former ghost. The next artifact uncovered was on the dead world of Xil, where a Moebius Foundation team had been wiped out. The Raiders descended to the surface and discovered why\u2014the Tal'darim. However, using the Drakken laser drill as both excavator and weapon, the Raiders succeeded where Moebius had failed and retrieved the artifact.Whispers in the Dark  After Xil, Raynor was confronted by another protoss, one who didn't want to kill him\u2014Zeratul. He gave Raynor a cryptic warning about Kerrigan, that for all her sins, she was the only one who could save them from a looming catastrophe. The rebel received an ihan crystal from the Nerazim, one that contained Zeratul's memories. Memories that would allow the terran to understand what his protoss friend had seen and experienced. Raynor stared into the crystal, seeing Zeratul arrive on the world of Ulaan, seeking a prophecy that heralded the return of the xel'naga. However, Kerrigan was present as well, along with her zerg. The two fought and Kerrigan held her own, but her heart wasn't in it. Like Zeratul, she had seen portents of what the future would bring. And unlike the Dark Templar, she was willing to let fate take her. Zeratul however, clung onto hope and retrieved the prophecy's fragments. He traveled to Zhakul, where the fragments might be translated. Raynor was losing himself in the crystal, prompting the concern of those around him. Nonetheless, he watched as Zeratul arrived on Zhakul, finding the three preservers he sought imprisoned by a hybrid and the local protoss corrupted by its influence. The prelate defeated the creature and freed the preservers, who in turn interpreted the prophecy. It spoke of a \"Fallen One\" and that what had begun with the Great Hungerer would end in utter darkness. Zeratul realized that the \"Great Hungerer\" might be the Overmind and departed for Aiur. Aiur was a ruined world, and the area around the corpse of the Overmind was no exception. Zeratul accessed its thoughts from its tendrils, sensing, strangely enough, fear of the future, yet also joy. Arriving at its cortex, the Nerazim was confronted by the spirit of Tassadar, thought dead four years ago. Tassadar had never truly died, and in the high templar's own words, never would. He explained that the Overmind was not always the monstrous creature the protoss had fought in the Great War. Instead, its personality had been altered by an outside force, the Dark Voice, compelling it to assault the protoss rather than merge naturally to perform the xel'naga's cycle of rebirth. The Overmind knew it had been corrupted, but had been created without free will and could therefore not fight its overriding directive. It could, however, create a being who might save its species from manipulation...the Queen of Blades. For it had seen what the future held. And through Tassadar, Zeratul saw it as well. In the present, Raynor took the final step and saw what others before him had\u2014Armageddon. Humanity had been consumed, the galaxy was in flames, the protoss were making a final stand on a distant, shadowed world and the Swarm had come under the control of the hybrids, as well as their mysterious leader. The Dark Voice mocked the protoss, revealing that in this future, Kerrigan, the one person who might have saved them, was dead, killed in the perception that she had been the true threat. The protoss were eventually overcome and darkness descended over the galaxy. And Kerrigan, the same being responsible for bringing death and destruction to the Koprulu Sector, was the only one who could avert this.The Final Artifacts  Sarah Kerrigan made another play for the artifacts. She personally led an invasion of Tyrador VIII, where the Moebius Foundation was based. Their own forces had managed to evacuate for the most part, but were unable to destroy their data cores which would reveal the locations of the rest of the artifacts. Raynor's Raiders were hired by the Foundation's leader, Dr. Emil Narud, to destroy the data cores before Kerrigan could get to them. The Raiders were successful in this action. However, this close call with Kerrigan caused Raynor to fall into a depression. The next artifact was located on Typhon XI. As the Hyperion neared the planet, the star it orbited began to fall into a supernova. Raynor's Raiders had to quickly descend, fight their way past Tal'darim and make off with the artifact before the planet was consumed. The Raiders once again stole an artifact from the Tal'darim. The Raiders, expecting to meet with the Moebius Foundation, instead came across a Dominion fleet, led by its flagship, the Bucephalus. Raynor and Findlay invaded the Bucephalus, intending to kill Arcturus Mengsk. Instead, Raynor found his son, Valerian, who offered to work with him in order to rescue Sarah Kerrigan from her infestation. Raynor agreed. Raynor's Raiders located the last piece of the artifact on a xel'naga worldship occupied by the Tal'darim. The Tal'darim Executor made a personal appearance in his own mothership but it was useless; the Raiders made off with the last piece.The Return to Char  Raynor allied with Valerian Mengsk to go down to Char to try to de-infest Kerrigan. Many members of his crew became distrustful of Raynor, especially Milo Kachinsky and Tychus Findlay, who drunkenly branded Raynor as a coward. Raynor overheard this, and after besting an armored Findlay during a fight, Raynor explained that the zerg invasion was the greater of two evils and doing so would save humanity, turning the crew back to his side. After an unpleasant meeting with General Horace Warfield, Raynor was briefed on the battlecruiser Bucephalus, the flagship of the Dominion fleet. Valerian received a transmission from his father, who was proud of his son's ambition, which was to prove himself a worthy heir by de-infesting Kerrigan and allying with the biggest terrorist ever, but believed he was in \"way over your head.\" Arcturus was then shocked that Raynor allied with his son, which Raynor assured Arcturus that they had a \"score to settle.\" After the transmission, Valerian was pleased. The zerg then launched a pre-emptive strike. The initial landing was a disaster. Many attack groups were destroyed while in-flight and those that landed were either wiped out by zerg forces on the planet or were scattered. Raynor and his forces were able to take a foothold on Char, soon afterward proceeding to rescue General Warfield and his men, who had crash landed in the initial assault. Warfield commended Raynor on his bravery. The zerg's ground or air support then had to be taken out. The terran forces could assault the main hive because of the massive number of zerg around it. More zerg were also incoming from previously invaded Terran Dominion worlds. Therefore, the zerg's nydus network had to be taken out or their air support. After the zerg's support was taken out, the terran forces rallied to launch the final attack on the primary hive, after an inspiring speech by Raynor. General Warfield, with a new cybernetic arm, delivered the fully assembled xel'naga artifact to Raynor, where the terran forces had to hold out against the zerg until the artifact was fully charged to de-infest Kerrigan. The artifact became fully charged and launched a powerful energy nova that destroyed the zerg forces and partially de-infested Kerrigan. Raynor and Findlay then led a small team of marines into the main hive to retreive Kerrigan. Tychus then tried to fulfill his deal with Mengsk by killing Kerrigan and earning his freedom. Raynor defended Kerrigan from Tychus and then shot him. Raynor then walked outside to a sunrise, carrying Sarah Kerrigan over a war-torn Char. Valerian Mengsk's gambit paid off; Kerrigan has been de-infested. While the zerg invasion was halted, Tychus Findlay is dead, and Arcturus Mengsk remains secure on his throne.Branching Paths Hanson's Saga  The Raiders aided the world of Agria, which had been abandoned by the Dominion. After the evacuation, Dr. Ariel Hanson joined the Raiders.Spectres  Gabriel Tosh, a former Dominion ghost turned anti-Dominion spectre, hoped to use the fighting to mask the acquisition of jorium, terrazine, and suitable candidates needed to augment Project Shadow Blade. He sought the help of Jim Raynor, hoping to use their alliance against Arcturus Mengsk.The Revolution  Although the Raiders had a low amount of funds as well as morale, these factors did not stop Matt Horner from working toward a better future.Collector's Edition  Wings of Liberty has a Collector's Edition, selling for $100 US dollars and is only available through retail stores. Bonus items include:Demo Version  On December 21st, 2010, a demo version of Wings of Liberty became available. The player could play through the first three missions, or play multiplayer (but only as terrans against a terran AI opponent). Unlike the original StarCraft demo, it doesn't have access to play through Battle.net. In the demo version there are only two Mar Sara maps available (Blistering Sands and Quicksand). All unit portraits are still (cannot be animated); the only exceptions are Jim Raynor (both marine and commander), Raynor's adjutant and Tychus Findlay. As of August 2011 the \"Starter Edition\" became available. This gives access to the first three missions of Wings of Liberty plus either The Evacuation or Smash and Grab (player's choice), the first two challenges: Tactical Command and Covert Ops, access to terrans in Single-Player vs AI and Custom Games in the following maps: Discord IV, High Orbit, The Shattered Temple, Xel'Naga Caverns and the custom map StarJeweled, subject to change over time. Achievements and campaign progress will be saved in case the player upgrades to the full version of Wings of Liberty.Reception Sales  Within one day of its release, Wings of Liberty had sold 1 million copies worldwide. After two days (during which period Blizzard began selling the game as a digital download on its website) it sold approximately 500,000 additional units, bringing the total up to 1.5 million worldwide and making it the fastest-selling strategy game of all time. After one month, it had sold 3 million copies worldwide.Scores Awards Nominations  At IGN in 2010, the game was also nominated for Best PC Soundtrack and Best PC Bang for Your Buck The British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) announced StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty will be nominated for the Strategy Category and the Multiplayer Category. The event is held March 2011. MI6, a game marketing organization, nominated Wings of Liberty for the following 2011 awards:Development  As per each installment of StarCraft II, Wings of Liberty was to focus on the fantasy of its playable race. In this case, the terrans\u2014building a stronger army through completing missions and earning credits. Most of the missions were designed to reflect that Raynor could not take on Mengsk directly, and as such, had to choose his battles tactically.Andy Chambers finished completion of the game's story, after most of the groundwork had been laid in. A storyline that was cut from the game was a drinking problem for Raynor. Raynor would be shown to make mistakes even as the player successfully completed missions. Raynor would overcome his personal demons and find redemption. Such was Chris Metzen's idea, but the development team reacted negatively, finding it unnecessary, citing issues of player empowerment. According to Metzen, the original concept was to portray Raynor as a full-blown alcholic. However, this was dialed back, as he didn't want to portray Raynor as being a man completely without hope. The United Earth Directorate was originally going to play a significant role in StarCraft II. However, this plot point was scaled back. In the context of Wings of Liberty itself, it was deemed that the conflict between the Dominion and Raynor's Raiders was sufficient without having to bring in the UED. The Wings of Liberty beta launched on February 17, 2010. The final release had been pushed back to at least the first half of 2010 to give adequate time to develop Battle.net. Development of the game itself is currently focused on polishing the singleplayer, specifically briefings, newscasts, outros and videos for unlocked technologies. As of March 2010, all missions were in, dialog was in, and all game mechanics were working. Its storyline had been fully solidified, and the team who developed it moved on to Heart of the Swarm. StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty was released on July 27, 2010. It had a day one patch.Notes Protoss  The protoss, a.k.a. the Firstborn, are a sapient humanoid race native to Aiur. Their advanced technology complements and enhances their psionic mastery. The main protoss cultural groups are the Khalai, who adhere to the communal Khala, and the Nerazim, who reject the Khala. In addition, another branch of the protoss separate from the Khala called the Tal'darim lives in various places in the galaxy. Protoss civilization was reunified when the Khalai and Nerazim, sundered since the Discord, were reunited after the devastation of Aiur by the zerg during the Great War. Alongside the zerg and terrans, the protoss stand as one of the three dominant species of the Milky Way. Protoss are not found outside the Koprulu sector.History  The protoss are an ancient race, and they consider themselves to be the \"firstborn\" race of the universe.Aeon of Strife  The protoss were discovered by Amon and his followers on Aiur, a world the xel'naga had previously engineered. The xel'naga, who were nearing the end of their life cycle, were in need of a race to achieve purity of form and intrigued by their mental connection, chose to use the protoss. Amon uplifted the protoss and manipulated their essence. Pushing the evolution of the protoss, the purity of form was achieved and the xel'naga eventually descended to Aiur. The protoss, who revered the Amon and his followers as gods, learned much from them. But in time, they began to grow wary of their creators, and rebelled from them, attacking their ships and killing hundreds. Amon and his followers left the planet as the protoss fell into the Aeon of Strife, a period of brutal civil war. Until the End War, history would hold that it was the xel'naga as a whole that were responsible for this uplift. The destructive civil war ended when Khas, using xel'naga-derived artifacts called khaydarin crystals, re-created the psionic link. It became the basis of a new philosophy called the Khala. Approximately 1500 by terran reckoning, the Conclave attempted to exterminate rogue heretics who had deliberately cut themselves off from the Khala and would later become known as the Dark Templar. They ordered Executor Adun to execute them, but Adun refused, instead teaching the rogues to hide from the Conclave. Eventually the rogues lost control of their powers, alerting the Conclave. They were secretly banished on a xel'naga ship. By 2499 the protoss became aware of a xenomorphic threat, the zerg, another alien species also created by the xel'naga. The zerg were attacking the terrans, a species which had traveled to the Koprulu Sector two hundred years previously. The Conclave dispatched Tassadar and a force of protoss to destroy the infestation by purifying the infested worlds.Fall of Aiur  Tassadar's force failed in its mission, and the remnants traveled to the new zerg homeworld, Char. There, Tassadar struck an alliance with the Dark Templar prelate, Zeratul. They discovered a weakness in the zerg command structure which could be exploited only by the Dark Templar, and clashed with their new leader, the Queen of Blades. Meanwhile, the majority of the zerg force traveled to Aiur. The protoss were losing the battle, but when Tassadar brought Zeratul to Aiur, a protoss civil war broke out between Tassadar's followers and the followers of the Conclave. Eventually Tassadar's faction won. Unimpeded by the Conclave, Tassadar's followers attacked the Overmind itself. Tassadar died during the battle. Seventy percent of protoss on Aiur were killed. The protoss fled to Shakuras, followed by a zerg faction. The protoss destroyed the renegade zerg, saving themselves but advancing Sarah Kerrigan's aims. With the assistance of her enigmatic minion Samir Duran, she would later force the protoss into destroying the second Overmind for her, making her the sole leader of the Zerg Swarm. As the protoss attempted a revenge strike on Kerrigan, Duran abandoned her to conduct protoss/zerg hybridization experiments, which were discovered by Zeratul. The latter exiled himself for several years following the discovery.End War  The protoss spent years rebuilding the Golden Armada to retake Aiur, and in 2506, the fleet was launched to retake their homeworld. However, this coincided with the return of Amon, who corrupted the Khala and possessed every protoss connected to it. Artanis gathered the survivors aboard the arkship the Spear of Adun, and set off to find the means to fight Amon. They followed Zeratul's lead to the temple of Ulnar, but found the xel'naga there dead. Artanis then united the ancient Purifiers and the Tal'darim, and moved to reclaim their home. The attack was successful; Aiur was reclaimed and Amon was thrust back into the Void. The protoss, with the aid of the Dominion and Zerg Swarm, pushed into the Void and slew Amon, ending his manipulations of the protoss.Physiology  Protoss are about two meters (seven feet) to three meters tall, with typical heights of eight to nine feet (2.4-2.7 meters). The height of researcher Ulavu was given as two and a quarter meters. A protoss would consider a human over six feet tall to be \"short\". While the average protoss weight has not been documented, Tassadar weighed 145 kilograms. They have two glowing eyes that blink normally, digitigrade legs, semi-permeable skin covered in scales, and toes, broad chests and shoulders, and narrow waists with slim midsections. Extending back from the crown of the head, protoss have a bony crest. Aside from their eyes, protoss possess no other orifices on their bodies. Beneath it, emerging from the back of the head, are the nerve cords, allowing them to access their racial psionic gestalt. This gestalt is the basis of the Khala. Protoss hands are notable for their variation, with some protoss having two fingers and two thumbs, and others having three fingers and only one thumb. This is a random hereditary trait among the protoss. The xel'naga considered these beings to have purity of form as the protoss are incredibly adaptable to harsh natural conditions and climates, and their strength and speed were unparalleled amongst the other races known to the xel\u2019naga. Protoss have sharp claws, which can be deadly weapons if a protoss is caught unarmed. Protoss derive sustenance from light, capable of living off moonlight (reflected sunlight), and can go without light for extended periods of time. What little water they need is absorbed through the skin. The Dark Templar modified themselves biologically and used other techniques to survive on the formerly lightless world of Shakuras. Protoss describe the principle of light absorption to be the same as plants, but over a much wider electromagnetic spectrum. Protoss require oxygen to survive. Protoss waste excretion occurs on a molecular level through the skin. The protoss used to hunt, but they did so to collect the blood and hides of animals for various purposes, not for sustenance. Protoss hear and smell through their skin, and it is believed that their primary sense is sight. Protoss have a sense of smell sharp enough to identify other protoss and see very well at night. A protoss' skin color may change in response to changes in its emotions. They are bereft of mouths, noses, or visible ears and are without a sense of taste. They possess three hearts, though they are located so closely together in the body, many protoss refer to it as one organ. Protoss sleep and dream in a manner similar to humans. When particuarly emotional, streams of energy have been observed to stream from a protoss's eyes, similar to how a terran might cry. Eye colors include blue, green, gold, violet, and red. The proliferation of eye color corresponds to kindred; Khalai eyes are predominantly blue, Nerazim are predominantly green, and red is present among the Tal'darim, though has also been observed for the Khalai. A protoss's maximum life expectancy is 1000 years, though exceptions exist. Like other creatures, protoss grow weaker with age, with physical and mental faculties degrading as they get late into their lives. Protoss are not a prolific people, to the extent that the xel'naga developed an artifact, the Kassia crystal, to counteract this. The population of Aiur, however, had reached billions. Before the Fall of Aiur, the protoss population was in decline due to systemic extermination; the protoss were passing away from sheer age. Their numbers have been further reduced through conflict, and their population continues to decline. Protoss blood is blue or a dark purplish color, almost black. Protoss can bear birthmarks. As in humans, skin color is considered a sign of ethnicity, with each protoss tribe having a specific subtly differing hue or typical pattern of markings associated with it. While the protoss are no longer a tribal society, the tribal bloodlines still run strong. As with terrans and zerg, protoss genetic material consists of DNA with helix strands. There is evidence that the protoss have yet to unlock their full genetic potential, but this theory died along with the Protoss Advance/Experimental Facility. Protoss DNA is \"antithetical\" to zerg DNA and cannot be combined through infestation under normal circumstances. Artificial methods can be used to generate hybrids however. A protoss may still serve as the host for a zerg parasite. Protoss possess a body part called a thylar, which may be held by their hand.Medical Care  On the battlefield protoss warriors are known to fight with tremendous power and grace, but despite the chaos they inflict on their enemies they are capable of being mortally wounded. When a protoss nears death, their foes often bear witness to a startling flash of bright light as the protoss warrior seemingly disappears. Primitive races are known to quail in superstitious fear upon seeing this, but it is actually another aspect of protoss technology at work rather than any sort of supernatural feat. Protoss armor is typically equipped with a complex teleportation mechanism that can detect when its wearer is grievously injured and automatically teleports the warrior to the nearest safe haven. This of course is dependent on the mechanism being fully functional, as there is the risk of being damaged during combat. Those protoss who are too badly injured after the battle but still wish to continue fighting are placed within the shell of a dragoon, immortal or vanguard, which allows them to serve their brethren on the battlefield. The choice is left to each individual protoss; whether to continue service or join with their ancestors in the Khala. Protoss that suffer injuries to their psionic appendages (such as the Nerazim) attach clamps to the remnants in order to prevent energy bleed. Terran understanding of protoss physiology is limited. Their respective biologies are similar enough for substances and drugs, such as Sundrop and a medic's medicine to affect both.Mental Abilities  Their powerful psionic abilities extend further than that of human ghosts. Protoss have been described as \"devastatingly intelligent\", and their thought processes work very differently than those of terrans. They are able to contemplate multiple scenarioes and run through many different lines of thoughts and memories in the span of a second. Protoss are natural mind-readers. They must learn to filter the thoughts they read, block and release (which would prevent other protoss from reading their minds). The ability to block thoughts is compromised by the Khala, which prevents the protoss which follow that philosophy from hiding from each other. During the Aeon of Strife, Protoss regularly used their mind-screening abilities to ambush each other. Protoss can use their psionic abilities to shield themselves, charge their tools and weapons, and to materialize, manipulate or meld matter. At least some of these abilities can only be used by a small minority of protoss without technological assistance (such as the creation of shields). Protoss can sometimes access memories and strands of experience from protoss who have died and entered the Khala, but only preservers have full access to this knowledge. Protoss warriors can learn from the spirits of fallen warriors at the Templar Archives. The powers of the Khala and the Void protect protoss from zerg infestation.Communication  Protoss can communicate telepathically with each other. They can do so through \"speaking\", a method that transmits little or no emotional content. Using their nerve cords they can also communicate in a manner which enables them to sense each others' emotions, a key part of their psionic gestalt, the Khala. During the Aeon of Strife this ability had fallen into disuse, but was restored by the mystic Khas. Protoss who follow the Khala use both methods of communication.Dark Templar ritually sever their nerve cords, which prevents the emotional link. Clamps are placed on these severed nerve cords to prevent energy bleed. Protoss can create a special kind of mind-meld deep within the Khala, where no one can lie. Protoss performing this kind of mind-meld hold up their hands and face their palms to each other; both palms softly glow. This kind of communication was also possibly held between Executor Adun and Raszagal, the latter not following the Khala. Protoss \"speak\" a language called Khalani, communicating through telepathic bursts. The privacy of the conversation is up to those involved on it. Even through communication, pain can be caused via this telepathy via mental spikes. Terrans exposed to protoss communication often hear nearly meaningless sounds. However, at least some protoss have the ability to \"translate\" the thoughts into a form which a terran can understand. There is a limit to how far a protoss can communicate through telepathy\u2014psychic boosters are used for ship-wide broadcasts, and psi-link spires are used for communication across interstellar distances. Protoss are capable of using their telepathic powers to directly interface with terran video communication systems. Often psi links are outfitted into protoss helmets and gauntlets to allow them to communicate over distances and in the mental chaos of battle. The protoss of the Aeon of Strife did not understand the concept of non-psionic communication. Khas effectively (re-)created the concept of reading and writing, a necessity for translating some xel'naga relics. In addition to telepathy, protoss possess a degree of body language used in conveying feelings, intent, etc. For instance, a bob of the head and movement of a protoss' nerve chords is a sign of contempt. Bowing of the head, shaking and/or mottling of the skin is a sign of emotional distress. Terran technology is able to detect and interact with long range protoss communication frequencies through use of a hyper-waveform emitter.Culture  Protoss culture is built around core philosophies that have been rigidly adhered to for over a millennium. As such, it is difficult for their society to adapt to changing circumstances. The integration of Khalai and Nerazim is a case in point in different cultural values. Khalai culture has its roots in the Aeon of Strife, the period of chaos following the retreat of the xel'naga. At the end of the Strife, the protoss were reunited under the precepts of the Khala (\"Path to Ascension\") as promoted by the mystic Khas. The Khala took advantage of the natural psionic communal link and established a caste system. Protoss can be fanatical when it comes to their religious beliefs. Not all protoss embraced the Khala. Many outcasts, eventually known as the Nerazim, were later banished from Aiur. Yet other outcasts, the Tal'darim, use drugs to cut themselves off from the Khala. Female protoss rarely attain positions of power, except among the Nerazim. They are rare among the Templar Caste and were never part of the Conclave. Many protoss have a prejudice against female terrans, as the only one they've had much contact with was Kerrigan (contrasted to Jim Raynor). Very young protoss are referred to as \"younglings.\" The protoss are considered a \"warrior race\", although they were not constantly at war. They trained incessantly for combat, however, and prior to the Great War warred with the kalathi and \"other types\" of protoss. Protoss have a strict code of justice and honor, and strongly believe in their responsibility to enforce it. They strive for glory in battle. For the protoss, discipline and advanced technology are the key to success on the battlefield, and dying with honor is preferable to surviving through cowardice. Protoss have always been willing to sacrifice their lives for other members of their species. Protoss revel in the glory of personal combat, and consider the ranged weapons of terrans to be cowardly. Nonetheless, they recognize the necessity of ranged warfare, hence the existence of technology such as the photon cannon. Aiur holds great, almost spiritual significance to all protoss. The protoss, or at least the Khalai, do not not have a concept of luck, instead seeing \"the synchronicity of events,\" and knowing there is a grander design behind them. Among the Nerazim, family ties are important, but among the Khalai and Tal'darim, family terms are indirect, and protoss do not form terran-like family units.Language  Protoss have a mental language, Khalani, and a written language, which the Nerazim maintained. Khalai can communicate wordlessly due to the properties of the Khala, while Nerazim must voice their words vocally.Religion  The protoss as a whole once worshiped the xel'naga as gods. In the present day, various protoss have also referred to the xel'naga as gods, and the Tal'darim have taken a hardline approach to worship of Amon and his follower xel'naga as a deities.Protoss Heroes  A number of protoss are highly regarded by both Khalai and Nerazim, and have become associated with honorifics (e.g. \"en taro\"\u2014\"in honor of\"):Factions  The extent to which the protoss have been a unified people has waxed and waned over time. Originally tribal based, the protoss settled under centralized rule with the coming of the xel'naga, only to revert back to tribalism in the Aeon of Strife, only to once again be unified after thousands of years. Under the Khala, the Khalai formed the caste-based Protoss Empire while those who refused to submit became the outcast Nerazim. In the aftermath of the Brood War, both lines of protoss were united under the Daelaam. However, internal tension once again led to tribalism and their civilization fractured. In the aftermath of the End War, the Daelaam united the remaining tribes, and reclaimed Aiur as the homeland for all protoss. The Tal'darim are a branch of protoss that were taken from Aiur during the departure of the xel'naga, and serve as a seperate culture from the Khalai and the Nerazim, unconnected to the Khala. They are warlike, and before his fall served Amon with a fanatical devotion, using terrazine to become closer to him. While not true protoss, the Purifiers were templar designed by the protoss who rebelled over not being treated as true templar. During the End War, they were absorbed back into protoss society with the promise of equal treatment to true protoss.Technology  Protoss technology is a blend of psionics and mundane technology and has shown itself to be far more advanced than many other species of the galaxy, including humanity, which was \"digging in the dirt for grubs\" by the time the protoss had achieved interstellar travel. They have been referred to as \"the most technologically advanced race in the universe,\" and their warriors are \"the best trained in the galaxy.\" Some protoss technology requires vespene gas as a catalyst. Protoss utilize cybernetic technology to save lives, and bolster their warriors' prowess. This technology is so advanced when compared to that of terrans that to some terran scientists, classifying it as \"technology\" at all seems inadequate, as protoss have displayed a cognitive, almost spiritual bond with their cybernetic machines. Protoss metals was particularly durable, not decaying or eroding even after hundreds of years of neglect. Even battlefield scraps of protoss metal can maintain their undiminished shine without signs of pitting, scarring, or scorching. Battlefield communications between protoss are efficient. The use of energy for defensive purposes is a standard protoss practice. Protoss armor contains teleportation technology which whisks the warrior away to safety when they are injured to the point of death. Injured and crippled protoss can be transformed into cybernetic warriors. Due to their low population, the protoss frequently use robots in their military. Due to their diminished population, the protoss are in a position of not being able to waste resources. Protoss pilots are an integral part of their ship, and using it drains their energies. Protoss aerospace craft utilize anti-gravity technology to keep them airborne when operating within a planet's atmosphere. The protoss developed powerful crystal technology and incredibly powerful weapons of war, such as the colossus and the mothership, and could develop more powerful technology if they wished. The protoss limit their use of technology, as they are frightened of what they could do with it and feel they have perfected a slow but steady and methodical system of technological development. The longevity of protoss history has allowed them to develop incredible weapons of war over the course of it. Despite the Fall of Aiur, the protoss can still produce starships on other planets, and they have also inventories of them in many places. Protoss excel in energy manipulation. Arcthium gems are key to their technology.Gameplay StarCraft StarCraft: Ghost StarCraft II Notes Development Xel'naga  The xel'naga were a highly advanced race. Described as \"the most powerful species the universe has ever known,\" the xel'naga have been referred to as \"wanderers from afar,\" but it has also been described as being their true name. The protoss referred to the xel'naga as the \"Ihan-rii\", the \"Great Teachers\", the \"Makers\", and the \"Guardians\", during the Aeon of Strife, and prior to it, worshipped them as gods. Some protoss still refer to them as such. According to protoss tradition, the xel'naga were peaceful, benevolent and utterly consumed with studying and propagating sentient evolution within the universe.History Origins  Originating from the Void, the xel'naga were incredibly long-lived even by protoss standards, but not immortal; eventually their species would come to an end. In the interest of survival they planned to create new xel'naga by uplifting two species. A pair of qualities was required and these were defined by the xel'naga as purity of essence and purity of form, and each uplifted species would be targeted for one of them. Over an extraordinarily long period of time, the two species would naturally come together and merge, forming the next generation of xel'naga and beginning the cycle anew. The cycle was repeated in numerous universes; at the start of a universe's creation, the xel'naga would take on physical form and enter the universe, seeding it with life. The cycle repeated so many times that time itself was affected by it. However, some among the xel'naga resented being uplifted into their god-like forms, and saw the Infinite Cycle of the xel'naga's reproduction as horrid, relying on the conflict of others for the benefit of the xel'naga. Under a powerful xel'naga named Amon, this rogue group of xel'naga sought to undo the xel'naga's work, purge the universe of their creation, and make a new perfect universe without the strife of the cycle.Arrival in the Milky Way  Using khaydarin crystals, the xel'naga carefully and indirectly steered the delicate evolutionary processes of their budding species for millennia, keeping a detailed genetic history of each race. Their protracted experiments produced many intriguing deviants and mutations, but the races that they cultivated always fell short of their enormous expectations. During their journeys, they learned of the Voice in the Darkness, a Void-based entity which consumed entire civilizations. The xel'naga, who cherished life, imprisoned it with an Argus crystal beneath a barren world at KL-2. The xel'naga found or created a powerful relic, the Argus Stone, which they valued over other artifacts, but left it on the world of Aridas. The zerg believe it had been used to create entire races.The Firstborn  The xel'naga slumbered within the Chamber of Ascension as the universe grew, waiting for the two destined races to assemble the Keystone and find their way to Ulnar. Seeing their opportunity, Amon and his followers left Ulnar and sought to personally uplift the evolution of two species to gain the xel'naga's purities.They focused their efforts on the jungle world of Aiur, one of the xel'naga's engineered worlds. Pleased with the progress of its most advanced native life-forms, the renegade xel'naga conceded that their latest creation was their first of all their experiments to evolve beyond the feral constraints of baser life-forms. They gave the new race the name of protoss, or 'the firstborn'. Unsatisfied with the slow progress of the protoss, Amon and his allies accelerated their evolution and spent a millennium subtly guiding their steps. They used devices such as the Kassia crystal to enhance their rate of reproduction. Eventually, Amon's xel'naga succeeded in leading the protoss to the state of total sentience and awareness. When the protoss became highly intellectual and introspective, Amon and his followers were exhilarated by their seeming success. Attempting to discern the full extent of protoss evolution, they made themselves known to the protoss and integrated into their culture. Amon's xel'naga constructed a temple to mark the site where they first set foot upon Aiur. They also dug vast subterranean caverns, vast cities where they experimented on the protoss. The protoss were united by their fascination with these new \"gods.\" They called their new benefactors the Ihan-rii, the \"Great Teachers\", the \"Makers\", and the \"Guardians\". Amon's xel'naga marveled at how driven the protoss were to plumb the mysteries of the universe around them. However, they reeled in frustration when the protoss tribes grew further and further apart. At first, Amon's xel'naga were intrigued by this ideological development, and conducted an experiment to see what effects the diverging tribes might have on khaydarin crystals. They created twin crystals, the Khalis and Uraj, from a monolithic crystal and gifted them to the Sargas and Akilae Tribe respectively. The crystals' powers and appearance diverged with their tribes.The Departure  Amon's xel'naga speculated that perhaps they had pushed protoss evolution too far. As individual egos arose to overpower the once primary communal link, many of Amon's followers believed that the protoss had lost their greatest strengths. With the loss of the primal psychic link, which the xel'naga considered the most fundamental element of their greatness, they deemed that the purity of form they sought to create had been sullied by a conflict of essence and thus decreed that the protoss were a failed creation as a result of their sentience being pushed too quickly. Amon's xel'naga were already done with the protoss, and needed to work on a new species. Hundreds of Amon's were killed in a protoss attack when they tried to leave, but they were fended off long enough for the greater number of their worldships to be launched. They left behind khaydarin crystals and at least one ship.Broken Cycle  Amon and his followers traveled to Zerus, where they dismissed their tenets of physical form and focused chiefly on the pursuit of a distinct purity of essence. They labored to advance the evolution of the zerg, which was the most insignificant life form on Zerus until their proto-genetic manipulations enabled the zerg to survive the torrential firestorms and thrive. The zerg ultimately developed the ability to assimilate other races into themselves, and Amon knew that they had achieved their goal when the zerg became conditioned to survive the harshness of space. However, the xel'naga were alarmed to discover that the original races assimilated by the zerg were almost unrecognizable after only a few generations of their inception. Amon desired their ability to steal essence, but the zerg were independent. Remembering their failure with the protoss, Amon's xel'naga attempted to waylay the potential hazards of differing egos by structuring the collective sentience of the zerg into a unified, amalgamated hive mind, creating a separate entity called the Overmind to control the swarm. They kept a constant watch on the Overmind via a psychic link. Feeling an absence within the Void itself as the protoss created the Khala, the other xel'naga were disturbed from their slumber. Discovering Amon and his followers at Zerus, a war erupted among the xel'naga; in response, Amon unleashed the zerg. The xel'naga attempted to stem the tide of the ever-advancing onslaught, but the reinforced hulls of their worldships were battered by wave after wave of zerg swarms with no signs of abatement. The xel'naga defenses were overrun within a few hours and the greater whole of the xel'naga race was consumed, an action which threw the xel'naga plan into turmoil. A fraction of the xel'naga remained within Ulnar, however, and Amon himself was felled in the final confrontation. He was thrust back into the Void and twisted it with his hatred, though the zerg continued to feel his influence. One of his surviving servants thereafter sought a body to sustain Amon. The Overmind assimilated some of the xel'naga's knowledge as it processed thousands of xel'naga into itself, and decided that the protoss would become the zerg's ultimate target.Creation's Vacuum  During the Golden Age of Expansion, Khyrador became home to the Uraj crystal. However, it was later abandoned during the Discord when a series of violent psionic storms rocked Khyrador and drove away its protoss settlers. Believing terrazine to be a gift from the xel'naga, Tal'darim mystics set up altars on Bel'Shir to collect what they called 'the Breath of Creation'. The Tal'darim also guarded pieces of the Keystone on Monlyth,Xil,Typhon XI and a derelict xel'naga worldship in the Sigma quadrant. When the Nerazim found a temple which the xel'naga had constructed above a nexus of powerful cosmic energies, they decided to remain on Shakuras to study it. During the Brood War, the temple grounds were infested by two cerebrates. The protoss scoured the infestation then secured the Uraj. On Char, several cerebrates locked onto the Khalis' energies and nested near it, but it too was retrieved by the protoss. The protoss used the crystals to channel the temple's energies. The resulting explosion obliterated the zerg on Shakuras. Terran explorers whispered of alien ruins uncovered along the fringes of space prior to the Great War, but these were dismissed as exaggerated rumors by the majority of the Confederacy. Shortly before the Brood War, the xel'naga temple on Bhekar Ro was unearthed. The temple housed a strange \"phoenix-like\" energy creature which absorbed the essences and genetics of both protoss and zerg. Duran used genetic manipulation to create protoss/zerg hybrids on a thousand different worlds. At the end of the Brood War, Dark Prelate Zeratul encountered Duran on a dark moon. He continued to seek answers for what manner of being Duran truly was, and what dark future he was working toward. However, he was suffering mentally for numerous reasons, such as the death of Matriarch Raszagal at his hand. Years after his discovery, Zeratul was located by a preserver, Zamara, and her terran \"host\", Jake Ramsey. They restored Zeratul's mood and exchanged information. According to Zamara, Samir Duran's experiments are a \"perversion\", and if his attempts to \"unify\" the species become successful, \"a monstrous and powerful perversion of both protoss and zerg will be set loose upon the universe, and all that [the protoss and terran] know and cherish will fall in their wake\". Zeratul traveled to the world of Pegasus, where a xel'naga temple hatched. He followed the energy creature through a wormhole to a mysterious planet on the other side.Return of the Xel'naga  After uncovering a revelation somehow related to the xel'naga, Zeratul sought additional clues to unravel the mystery. Both he and Sarah Kerrigan were drawn to Ulaan to uncover a prophecy, rumored to foretell the return of the xel'naga, that was divided into three fragments, each kept at separate shrines. Zeratul gathered the fragments and had them deciphered by the preservers of Zhakul. Crown Prince Valerian Mengsk used the vast resources of the Terran Dominion to scour the Koprulu sector for xel'naga artifacts. His Moebius Foundation sought the Keystone. The Dominion went to Mar Sara to excavate a piece of the Keystone. For months, Dominion engineers excavated it at White Rock Base. The Dominion forcibly shipped citizens there from Backwater Station to dig it up. As they were getting ready to move the artifact off-world, it was seized by Raynor's Raiders. Fearing the Keystone's power, Kerrigan dispersed the zerg to search for the various pieces. After Raynor's Raiders had collected the other Keystone fragments, it was assembled and the engineer corps moved it to the base of the primary hive cluster on Char. The terrans protected the artifact while it charged. It then extracted the essence that forged Kerrigan into the Queen of Blades. Narud used that energy to release Amon from the Void. The xel'naga wished Kerrigan restored as leader of the Swarm, and had Zeratul (by this point serving their interests, or at least what he perceived as the greater good) guide her to Zerus, where she was reborn as the Primal Queen of Blades, free of Amon's influence. Xel'naga relics which housed genetic information were also collected by Kerrigan on Zerus. Narud battled Kerrigan at Amon's temple, which he had built Skygeirr Station on top of. Alexei Stukov deactivated the five xel'naga temples that were amplifying Narud's power. Kerrigan killed Narud in the heart of the temple, but by this point Amon was alive again.Legacy of the Void Whispers of Oblivion  Zeratul, still searching for the last part of the xel'naga prophecy, came to a facility of Moebius Foundation for information and discovered that Amon had been revived on Atrias. Zeratul, together with the forces of Praetor Talis, reached Atrias and faced the Tal'darim to access the Temple of Erris. Inside the temple, Zeratul discovered that Amon was communicating with Highlord Ma'lash through a void catalyst. Zeratul destroyed the catalyst, at which point Ouros told him that the Keystone would \"usher you unto hope,\" showing its location on Korhal. Zeratul escaped the temple, despite Amon's efforts to stop him. During the Reclamation of Aiur, Amon corrupted the Khala, tethering the Khalai to his will. At the cost of his own life, Zeratul freed Hierarch Artanis from Amon's control by severing his nerve cords.Ulnar  The Keystone was taken by Moebius Corps. However, it was reclaimed by the Dominion at Bennet Port and handed over to Artanis. The Keystone guided Artanis into the Alterian Rift to Ulnar, where he and Kerrigan entered the Temple of Unification and, in accordance with the prophecies, worked together to seek out the Halls of Revelation. Upon entering the Chamber of Ascension, however, they found that those who slumbered within had been slain. Amon opened a portal to the Void, but the protoss were able to destroy the Void crystals which powered the gate, sealing the portal. Returning to Aiur, the protoss destroyed Amon's host body, then used the Keystone to extract him from the Khala. Once their nerve cords were severed, Amon was thrust back into the Void.Into the Void  Amon planned to return as his hatred festered within the Void. Ouros called to Kerrigan, who led an expedition into the Void with Artanis and Commander Jim Raynor. Narud was defeated by their forces, then finished off by Stukov. Ouros urged Kerrigan to merge with his essence and she agreed. Amon sent his forces against Kerrigan, but she was defended by Raynor, Artanis and Broodmother Zagara while Ouros bestowed his essence. With Ouros having given his life, the Infinite Cycle came to its end. Kerrigan ascended as xel'naga. With help from her allies, Kerrigan destroyed Amon's void crystals and defeated Amon.Children of the Xel'naga  Xel'naga corpses were gathered by the Daelaam for study, who gained insight into their biology. The Terran Dominion was unable to recover any bodies, but Emperor Valerian Mengsk desired to request the findings of the protoss. The Zerg Swarm also gathered what xel'naga essence it could from the corpses at Ulnar. As part of her parting gift to the Zerg Swarm, Sarah Kerrigan gifted Overqueen Zagara with the ability for the zerg to choose their own destiny, as well as the location of a sentience species who could house xel'naga essence. Zagara, seeking to have the zerg undo the damage of the past decade, had the Swarm take only a sufficient number of this species, and tasked zerg evolution master Abathur create a new species named the adostra, which could regenerate life on planets, from mixing xel'naga essence and the essence of the species that could house it. The life spawned on planets would also show signs of xel'naga essence within them. However, Abathur was displeased with the use of the Swarm to create non-zerg species, as well as the peace Zagara desired, and also used the essence to create chitha, psionic creatures of equal part zerg and xel'naga that could control nearby zerg, disrupt psionics and halt communications. Abathur sought to have the Dominion and Daelaam destroy the adostra, sparking a war between the factions to return the swarm to its former state. However, his plot was revealed, and his chitha were destroyed.Biology  Xel'naga biology varied based on the creature. Many, such as Ouros, Amon, and those depicted in the xel'naga temples showed a large squid-like creature with a bulbous body. Others such as Narud were large hunched creatures, similar to void thrashers. Sarah Kerrigan's xel'naga form was that of a flaming human with large wings. Creatures containing xel'naga essence echo numbers of the Cuccodujo series, as opposed to terran flora and fauna which echo the Fibonacci series. The xel'naga, and creatures that contain xel'naga essence, are able to passively facilitate the rapid growth of life around them, and cause extreme growths of flora and fauna even in dead worlds.Culture  The xel'naga cherished all life and refused to kill anything, not even the entity at KL-2. The protoss eventually followed a version of this philosophy, called the \"Dae'Uhl\". The xel'naga possessed some form of language exclusive to their species. At least some xel'naga buried and/or entombed their dead. The xel'naga used a \"universal natural\" code the protoss termed \"ara'dor\", which means \"perfect ratio\". Terrans call it the Golden Mean, symbolized by \u03c6 (\"phi\"). In mathematics and the arts, two quantities are in the golden ratio if the ratio between the sum of those quantities and the larger one is the same as the ratio between the larger one and the smaller. The golden ratio is approximately 1.6180339887. The golden ratio is related to the Fibonacci sequence and the Golden Spiral.Technology  The xel'naga understood that energy, essence, and information were all one, and mutable; they could convert material between these states with ease. The xel'naga left numerous artifacts on Aiur and other worlds, such as Ehlna,Roxara and Aridas. The xel'naga made liberal use of khaydarin crystals and other such crystals in their technology. One such crystal, the Kassia crystal, was used to regulate protoss fertility during their development. Some artifacts can be considered dangerous, since they can manipulate the minds of terrans. At least some are alive in a sense (once being described as an \"energy fossil\"). These artifacts are sought by protoss. The Nerazim especially have made efforts to track these down. To the protoss, much of the xel'naga's technology is akin to magic, and some of their shielding technology is immune to the psionic powers of the Khalai. The Terran Dominion made attempts to buy some from rival powers. Even the zerg have used spies in an effort to locate artifacts. Still more temples have appeared on worlds such as Nemaka,Aridas (where the powerful Argus Stone was stored) and Bhekar Ro; the latter disgorged a strange energy creature which collected protoss and zerg genetics for unknown purposes. Valerian Mengsk, the Heir Apparent of the Terran Dominion, has expressed interest in these temples, and Dominion forces have engaged in combat in an attempt to secure such temples. Watch towers seemingly crafted by the xel'naga have appeared. The xel'naga possessed the ability to create space platforms and artificial constructs, utilizing AI (or similar technology). Some pieces of xel'naga technology are immune to conventional weaponry. However, some xel'naga technology can disrupt the functions of other xel'naga technology, creating an opening for it to be dismantled or destroyed.Prophecies Braken Prophecies  There are prophecies relating to the planet Braken, a protoss world with religious significance. These prophecies claim that \"he who harnesses this world will someday wield a great power, sanctified by the ancient ones\".Kerrigan and Zeratul's Role  Kerrigan bantered with Zeratul on Char as a prelude to combat, where Zeratul told her: \"Your coming has been foretold... You are part of the culmination. But not the end of it. You shall show the way, the path that must be taken, the realigning of old truths no longer valid. Yours is not the hand, but your very existence provides necessary instruction.\" Kerrigan did not treat the pronouncement seriously at the time.Xel'naga Worlds  The following are worlds known to have been visited by the xel'naga, many of them possessing relics of their presence:Known Xel'naga Notes Development Jim Raynor  James Eugene\"Jim\" Raynor is a former terran marshal turned rebel, who has become one of the major figures in the Koprulu sector through his work to bring down the Confederacy and, later, in the struggle against the Confederacy's successor, the Dominion. Raynor is one of the few terrans to engage in a long-term alliance with the protoss.Biography  Jim Raynor was born a farm boy on Shiloh. In his youth, he was taught outdoor skills such as hunting and shooting by his grandfather, skills which would later prove useful as a marshal. The first eighteen years of his life were spent entirely on his homeworld, working on the farm. Raynor was good at both schoolwork and working farm equipment, and learned how to drive multiple vehicles such as the vulture and became an expert demolition player for the Centerville team. His father taught him how to brawl, and to stand up to bullies. Raynor would later say that his father taught him where to draw the line, rather than to take a stand.The Heaven's Devils Enlistment and Training  By 2488, the Terran Confederacy had been embroiled in the Guild Wars for three years. Resources were rationed, taxes were rising, and the military began to more aggressively recruit young folk, including Tom Omer, one of Raynor's friends. While waiting in his truck for fuel, Raynor encountered Hank Harnack, a rival demolition player. Harnack cut him off, prompting Raynor to beat him up. Later that day, Gunnery Sergeant Farley helped convince Raynor to join the Confederate Marine Corps. His parents objected, but eventually relented and accompanied him to his enlistment and affirmation in Centerville. Raynor had expected to be elated at the prospect of leaving his planet, but only felt a sense of dread. To make matters worse, he immediately ran into the bully Harnack again, who hassled him and made his position clear, leading to the other recruits ostracizing Raynor (including Omer) so as to not get caught up in their feud. Corporal Thaddeus Timson tried to keep them apart. The two exchanged beatings. Still, Raynor's standing up to Harnack did earn him the respect of his fellow recruits, who began talking to him. Eventually they (and Omer) ended up on the troopship Hydrus, where they would be shipped to the warzone planet of Turaxis II for basic training. Raynor was taken aback at the poor conditions, surprised to learn that despite the high taxes levied in the war, the Confederate military was still short of quality equipment. During the journey, hundreds of convicts intended for a little-known Confederate reform program broke out and began fighting. Harnack called one a freak, prompting several to attack him. Raynor jumped into the fray and fought alongside Harnack, while Omer won money betting on them. Raynor and Harnack then became friends. Raynor, Harnack, Omer and twelve other recruits rode in a dropship to the surface. However, it was shot down, killing the pilot and seriously injuring a recruit, Santhay. Raynor immediately took charge, helping move Santhay. Eventually they were rescued by Master Sergeant Hanson, who was impressed with Raynor's in-field leadership skills. The recruits were transported to Turaxis Prime for training, during which Santhay succumbed to his wounds. Raynor began to wonder what he'd got himself into. That it was announced that training was being shortened didn't help matters. During training, Raynor was made a \"recruit sergeant\" and led the first squad of 2nd Platoon, D Company. Harnack was also in the squad, and so fell under his command. While on a punishment detail with Harnack, he made the acquaintance of Ark Bennet, an Old Family scion who had been kidnapped and sold to the military under the name \"Ryk Kydd.\" They tutored him in a lifestyle away from the Old Families. On the night before their graduation, Raynor, Harnack and \"Kydd\" visited the town of Braddock, ready for some R&R. One thing led to another and they got drunk and fell into a bar brawl. They tried to escape by stealing a vulture but got caught by the police. However, they were released from the drunk tank the next day without incident. Before graduation, Raynor managed to get in touch with his parents, who tried to hide how poorly things were going for them financially despite the enlistment bonus they'd received. It was nice to know his parents were okay, but Raynor felt uneasy. Upon graduation, Raynor, Harnack, Kydd and numerous others were sent to Boro Airbase by air and then to Fort Howe by truck, where they made the acquaintance of Max Zander. Raynor noticed the adverse effect the war was having on the planet's population, and while he gave away his rations to starving children, he knew it wasn't enough, and knew that Shiloh could meet the same fate. Before long, the convoy was attacked by Kel-Morian Hellhounds and scattered. Their driver called the nearby Firebase Zulu and assigned Raynor to lead two squads of marines by foot while the others used the two remaining trucks. While hiking however, the sounds of battle to the south being heard, he realized that the flow of traffic had stopped. He ordered the squads to double time to the firebase. At the site, Raynor took command of his squads, operating under the designation of \"Zulu 23.\" He took Kydd and Zander into taking a sniper post and launching an attack which captured some Kel-Morian APCs. However, Raynor noticed Tom Omer suffering severe injury during the fight. Meanwhile, Raynor contacted Captain Senko at Zulu and kept him apprised of the situation. The Kel-Morians were driven off, though Omer was heavily wounded in the fighting and later died. Raynor offerred comfort in his last moments.New Friends  At Fort Howe, Raynor was promoted to lance corporal for his leadership qualities. However, he and his squad were frequently given boring assignments, such as handling supplies at Supply Depot 7. A soldier ranked private, looking for equipment to resupply himself, was disappointed when Raynor told him to return hours later. The large soldier, recently imprisoned and demoted Tychus Findlay, tried to intimidate him, with little success. When he grabbed Raynor's shirt, Hank Harnack came to his rescue. Findlay had to admit defeat and leave. Unfortunately for Raynor, Findlay had caught the attention of Howe's commander, Lieutenant Colonel Javier Vanderspool, who promoted him to sergeant and put him in charge of Raynor's squad. Findlay confronted them, but they were interrupted by Vanderspool's announcement of a Kel-Morian attack. Raynor suggested heading to the armory. There they noted Confederate marines loading civilian-driven trucks with valuable supplies. Raynor, Findlay and the others captured the trucks. However, Findlay took the opportunity to \"pursue the enemy\" out of the base; in practice, he intended to steal the loot, which he hid in Whitford. Findlay tricked Raynor into agreeing with a division of spoils, but consented to return the less valuable truck to keep up appearances. The newly-promoted full colonel Javier Vanderspool, leader of the 321st Colonial Rangers Battalion, a mixed-force unit of marines and rangers, created within it a Special Tactics and Missions Platoon. Lieutenant Marcus Quigby (whom Raynor was unimpressed with) was put in charge, and Findlay would lead the first squad within, which consisted of Hank Harnack, Ryk Kydd, Jim Raynor, Connor Ward, and Max Zander. Petty Officer Lisa Cassidy, a medic, became associated with the platoon, along with Hiram Feek, an engineer. Feek developed the CMC-230 \"Thunderstrike\" armor, designed to allow controlled descents from dropships. The platoon members were all expected to learn how to use the devices. The truck thieves, including Raynor, arranged to sell the loot. The deal went through fine, but shortly afterward they were attacked by hijackers, which the squad defeated. Quigby was unpopular with the platoon, especially Cassidy. She drugged his water, causing him to embarrass himself in a demonstration in front of his father. She was unofficially punished for this act, while Quigby was transferred elsewhere. This put Findlay in charge, at least temporarily. Zander used his earnings to buy food and give it away to refugees. Ward and Feek accompanied him to Finner's Crossing. While there, they were kidnapped by Silas Trask's gang, although Feek was able to escape and warn Raynor. Findlay and the others were drawn into the rescue attempt. Raynor suggested the countryside wasn't as empty as it appeared, so people would know about the captures. Raynor and Findlay bribed Hurley, a bar proprietor, for a map. While there, Raynor and Findlay exchanged life philosophies. Raynor's plan worked: Trask was killed and his gangsters defeated. Realizing Hurley had ratted them out to the gangsters, Findlay nearly beat him to death. Raynor was forced to pull him off.The Heaven's Devils' Legend Begins  Colonel Vanderspool planned an attack on a Kel-Morian military base, Kel-Morian Internment Camp-36 where hundreds of Confederate prisoners of war were being kept. He invited a former P.O.W., dropship pilot Clair Hobarth, to the briefing, where she gave them information about the camp and its commander, Overseer Hanz Brucker (aka \"Brucker the Butcher\"). The platoon was to train at \"Camp Crash\" for the assault. Raynor wasn't particularly skilled in the use of his Thunderstrike armor. Feeling guilty about the truck theft, Raynor came up with a plan to help with the assault. Believing the P.O.W.s would be weak and slow, Raynor would infiltrate the camp and organize them. He would disguise himself as a captured Kel-Morian Hellhound pilot, Ras Hagar, and memorized as much information about him as he could. Vanderspool agreed to drop him off a day early. \"Hagar\" met Brucker at his dinner, where numerous starving P.O.W.s were forced to watch and play music. Brucker realized that Raynor was a fake, however, and left the room to get help. Raynor took the opportunity to warn the prisoners. Brucker stormed back into the room with guards, who imprisoned Raynor. He was interrogated first about the upcoming attack by Brucker and Dr. Moller, and then about neural resocialization, something Raynor knew nothing about. Cole Hickson, another Confederate soldier from a different unit, was tortured alongside him and also questioned about resocialization. Hickson taught Raynor to \"hide\" in \"spider holes\" within his mind. Raynor believed he would have died or gone insane if it wasn't for Hickson. Eventually the two were tied to posts outside, in front of the other prisoners. This made it easier for the Thunderstrike-equipped platoon to rescue them. However, the rescue mission went awry when the Kel-Morians chased off the extra dropships. Raynor suggested stealing Kel-Morian ground vehicles and driving into the disputed zone instead. A saber command car was stopped, and Overseer Brucker was wounded and captured. While administering medical treatment, Lisa Cassidy poisoned Brucker. A large convoy of vehicles left the camp, carrying the former prisoners. Raynor, high on stimulants provided by Cassidy, led the way in a vulture. They were attacked by the Snakehead Kommando but were able to defeat them with help from Confederate reinforcements. The attack was considered a great victory, but at the cost of about half the platoon. At Three Fingered Jack's, Hobarth declared the platoon the \"Heaven's Devils\". Raynor and the others got tattoos to commemorate the name.The Battle of Polk's Pride  Colonel Vanderspool intended to capture a strategic resource depot in Polk's Pride, formerly the second most populated city on Turaxis II. The city was divided by the Paddick River into a north section (now dominated by the Kel-Morian Combine) and a south section (controlled by the Terran Confederacy). The Confederacy had tried to invade the northern section twice previously, but each time failed to cross the river. The Heaven's Devils platoon, now led by Lieutenant Samantha Sanchez, would follow right behind a large number of neurally resocialized troops led by the battalion's senior NCO, Master Sergeant Rockwell. Vanderspool devised a plan for crossing the river which worked. However, the Kel-Morians put up stiff resistance. Raynor watched as large numbers of resocialized troops were killed off. Sanchez was killed by an enemy sniper. Sniper Ryk Kydd vowed revenge but needed his friends to draw fire for a little while. Raynor did so, and was nearly killed by a shot to the head. Kydd took the opportunity to finish off the other sniper. At the repository itself, Master Sergeant Rockwell sent a large number of resocialized marines to their death. When he criticized their uselessness, Raynor lost his temper and punched him out. The combined Confederate forces, meanwhile, achieved victory. UNN reporter Max Speer took their picture.Devils' End  Raynor was arrested, demoted to private and jailed for a month for assaulting Rockwell. While serving his sentence, Hiram Feek frequently visited him. One day, he warned him of Colonel Vanderspool's treachery; the Devils' suits had been sabotaged. Feek discovered and fixed the suits. Feek also promised him a black, skull-faced suit. Meanwhile Vanderspool plotted a theft of ardeon crystals from Korsy's train system, with the collusion of Errol Bennet (father of \"Ryk Kydd\") and Kel-Morian Overseer Aaron Pax. Kydd and Max Zander brought the information to Tychus Findlay, who plotted to steal the crystals from Vanderspool. Vanderspool's force, including Raynor's platoon and a large number of neurally resocialized troops under the command of Lieutenant Fitz, disguised themselves as Kel-Morians and landed at Korsy's small starport. Raynor's platoon swept the western part of town, freeing citizens held captive by the Kel-Morians. They linked up with Vanderspool's force at the train station, and were ordered to stand in front. The train arrived, but Pax had double-crossed Vanderspool. His ripper force nearly won the battle, but Hank Harnack's flamethrower turned the tide. The train rushed away, taking away all the treasure, but Pax remained with some rippers. Vanderspool tried to kill the Devils by locking down their suits, but due to Feek's counter-sabotage, the move failed. Fitz was ordered to take Cassidy prisoner. Raynor and company managed to escape, steal several of Vanderspool's vehicles, and use their vehicles to pin them and the Kel-Morians inside the station. Kel-Morian sloths cut off the platoon's retreat toward the starport. During the battle, Connor Ward was killed, while Vanderspool escaped with some troops and personally slew Max Zander. At the starport itself, Harnack was killed when he set a lake of fuel on fire. Vanderspool arrived, but not under his own power. He and Cassidy had been captured by Overseer Pax. A firefight broke out, resulting in the deaths of both Pax and Cassidy and the wounding of Vanderspool. The colonel begged for his life, even offering to reunite Ryk Kydd with his father, to no avail. Vanderspool tried to take Pax's gun, but Raynor stepped on his hand, breaking it. Then Raynor shot him in the chest.Outlaws  Raynor, Findlay, and Kydd abandoned the military thereafter and the duo was charged with manslaughter in absentia. Findlay and Raynor stuck together while Kydd went his own way. Little communication was exchanged so they couldn't be traced. Over the years, the pair familiarized themselves with various ships and vehicles, often raiding shipyards to ditch their current ships for new ones. During this period, Raynor learnt of his father's death. Following the war, the pair became outlaws, conducting a series of heists over the years all across the Koprulu sector. One of their most regular targets was the Shale Express, hitting it at least a dozen times. Not even the deployment of outriders could stop them.Haji  Early in their career, in 2489, the pair were cornered on Haji by Confederate forces led by General Sol Kervock. Buildings around them were burned, causing casualties, but the pair escaped. The pair then brazenly stole a pair of Confederate vultures and began rescuing civilians caught in the fire. As the civilians rallied to them, the two even captured General Kervock. They released him, but Kervock plotted revenge along with his subordinate Ternas Shan and troops disguised as civilians. They ambushed the criminal duo, but the plan failed as the civilian populace killed many of them. Shan took the opportunity to murder Kervock. The duo were charged with Kervock's murder.New Sydney  In 2489, the pair established themselves on New Sydney and resided there for the next five years. Based in the Badlands, the two developed a routine of seizing Confederate credits (and in Raynor's case, antiques such as a Colt Single Action Army and jukebox), spending them and beginning the cycle over. A great deal of this spending was carried out at Wicked Wayne's, said spending mainly revolving around women and booze and becoming mutually acquainted with the staff in the process. This worked to their advantage as well when Marshal Wilkes Butler began hunting them in 2492, the staff never ratting them out. The pair had many encounters with the marshal over the years, but always managed to slip away. They managed to keep to a moral code during this time, never harming bystanders and usually disabling guards rather than killing them, George Woodley being a case in point of the former. During this period, Raynor always sent some of his loot to his mother on Shiloh. However, according to a message sent by old family friend Myles Hammond, Karol wasn't accepting the money. He also urged Raynor to return to his homeworld to discuss certain matters. Not sure what to make of it, Raynor refused, ordering Hammond to ensure that his mother took the credits. Hammond wasn't the only individual intent on contacting Raynor however, as the outlaw heard from Findlay not long after. Their criminal activities had caught the attention of crime lord Scutter O'Banon, who wished to hire their services. Raynor wanted nothing to do with the man however, having heard of O'Banon's savage reputation and his drug smuggling operations. The two agreed to remain solo for now, and Findlay suggested hitting Horley Barton Station for a shipment of crystals. The two stole a pair of planet-hoppers and by fixing the transponders onto their vultures, sent a pursing Butler forty killometres into the middle of nowhere. The two bluffed their way through the station and with a freighter full of crystals, headed to the moon of Hermes to meet their contacts. As a meeting in the Pit revealed, said contacts were a pirate group called the Screaming Skulls. Business was conducted and another offer was made, one which would involved the outlaws getting a significant share of profits and a new partnership. Raynor and Findlay accepted and headed back to New Sydney. However, they couldn't stay long\u2014one of Wicked Wayne's employees sold the pair out to the authorities, and the two were forced to retreat to their Badlands hideout. Weighing their options, they decided to do a mission for the Skulls, then find a new planet.Bounty Hunter  Given a starship of their own by the Skulls, Raynor and Findlay headed for Refurbish and Recovery Station 5034, posing as junk dealers. Their objective was to board the station, get access to the private offices and steal the port junker logs. During the trip, Raynor received a set of co-ordinates on his fone\u2014Hammond still wanted to contact him on New Sydney. The pair passed through the check-in station without a hitch, but upon docking, the doors were sealed. They realized that the Skulls had set them up for a fall. Making their way through the station, they heard the screams of what sounded like Hiram Feek and Clair Hobbarth. Following the sounds, they came across a hologram of Rykk Kydd, strangled to death by an unknown assaliant. The same assaliant who had killed Feek and Hobbarth, recording their deaths also. A bounty hunter by the name of Ezekiel Daun. Daun, using the holograms to spook the outlaws, had been hired to kill them and had already killed everyone on the station to achieve that goal. A gun battle ensued that developed into a brawl, but while the outlaws had the advantage in numbers, Daun's cybernetics gave him advantages of his own. The pair ended up retreating, Findlay manually opening the docking bay doors while Raynor prepped their freighter. Both succeeded in their tasks and Findlay made it onto the freighter without too much vacuum exposure. In the aftermath, Findlay told Raynor rumors of what he'd heard about Daun and stated that their only remaining option was to head for Deadman's Port and take up the offer O'Banon had made to them. Raynor wanted to head back to New Sydney to get in touch with Hammond, but, shaken with his encounter with Daun, bowed to Findlay's reasoning. The two thus set a course for Dead Man's Rock.Deadman's Port  Arriving at the city and selling their freighter, the pair were greated by Edward Baines\u2014the one who had made O'Banon's first offer to Findlay on New Sydney. They were taken to O'Banon's mansion and met the man himself. In light of Daun's pursuit of the duo however, the deal was changed somewhat\u2014O'Banon would give them protection, but in return, he'd have the greater share of the profits per job. Initially this worked out well, as the pair were able to walk freely through Deadman's Port and had access to a wide variety of goods and services. Findlay stripping naked in the middle of a stage performance, and giving a 'performance' of his own, was one such case in point. Fortunately, intoxication prevented Raynor from remembering most of it. While Findlay was okay with life under O'Banon, his friend remained uneasy. Daun weighed heavily on his mind, as did the deaths of Kydd, Feek and Hobbarth. Drug running for O'Banon got to him as well, as was the crime lord's use of torture. Added to which was Hammond's message on New Sydney (the one that he'd missed) and soon, his status in Deadman's Port had lost its appeal. Through a middle-man, Raynor managed to receive a message from Hammond, who revealed that his mother was dying, with only a few weeks to live. After some soul searching, Raynor resolved to head back to Shiloh. Findlay was against it\u2014O'Banon had given them a job, and he was tired of Raynor complaining about their benefactor. The two men almost came to blows, but Findlay eventually relented, seeing how important heading to Shiloh was to his friend. He agreed to drop him off there and give him a day to conduct his business.Return to Shiloh  Raynor returned to Shiloh and met up with Hammond, where he learnt of the dire straits of his parents, his homeworld and Hammond's intent to move to Mar Sara. He then reunited with his mother, who had contracted cancer from shipping material that had been used to store old Confederate rations as part of the Confederacy's half-hearted efforts to help its people recover from the Guild Wars. She then showed him a recording his father had made on his death bed, whose words explained why the Raynors had never accepted their son's money, along with their shame at the path he had chosen. Raynor was filled with shame and stayed with his mother until she died, which didn't take long. Afterwards, Raynor said his farewells to Hammond, who promised to take care of Karol's affairs and reminded Raynor that he'd be welcome on Mar Sara. Afterwards, as he returned to orbit with Findlay, Raynor reflected on all that had transpired, and how the life he'd led over the last five years had lost its appeal even further.Chasing Shadows  The job O'Banon had given Raynor and Findlay was to take place on Halcyon. Their mission was to extract Doctor Andrew Forrest from his facility. O'Banon ran drugs and rather than snaring the drugs themselves, he'd ordered the duo to extract the person who knew the formula of a new drug called utopia. Posing as doctors, the two took part in a tour conducted by Forrest and made contact with him at the earliest opportunity. The doctor had arranged this ahead of plan and was ready to leave. What none of them had planned for however was a power outage caused by a re-emerged Ezekiel Daun. Forrest was killed, but once again, the pair were able to escape with their lives, along with a sample of utopia. Raynor was rattled even more than we was after their first encounter and was skeptical that O'Banon could, or would do anything about it. It was skepticism that had merit\u2014O'Banon was unimpressed by their failure to extract Forrest and effectively skimmed over the fact that part of the terms of their employment included him keeping Daun off their tails. Peeved, Raynor drowned his sorrows and reflected that if O'Banon did live up to his end of the bargin, it would still end up costing him more than he bargained for. And all the while, his father's words played in his head. Still, as Raynor reflected, saying something was a lot easier than actually doing it. On his part, Findlay wasn't entirely opposed to the notion of ditching O'Banon, but pointed out that their exit strategy had to be well planned. And in the meantime, the crime lord had another heist planned that, if done right, could set the pair up for life.Outlaws' End  O'Banon's heist was to be carried out against the Covington Bank on Bacchus Moon alongside more of the crime lord's followers, most notably Ash Thompson. On the moon, they made contact with their contacts, who gave them the gear they would need to conduct the heist. However, their situation was further complicated by the presence of Wilkes Butler, who was attending the Interstellar Marshals Convention. They managed to shake his trail however, but during a dry run of the bank, ran into George Woodley\u2014recovered from his encounter with them on New Sydney. As such, the heist had to go ahead then and there. Still, it worked initially, with the patrons being sedate at gunpoint and spiders and the outlaws gaining easy access to the vault. However, to Raynor's horror, the money was intended for Farm Aid's charity work, and Findlay had known this all along. The two dissolved into bickering and fed up with their slow progress, Thompson used the spiders to kill the patrons then and there. This was the straw that broke Raynor's back and he reneged on his employment for O'Banon then and there. Thompson and his cronies opened fire, but Raynor and Findlay emerged the victors, though Raynor suffered a gunshot wound in the process. The pair made their escape to the penthouse above the bank as part of their escape plan, but were slowed down by Raynor's wound and a third appearence by Daun, who managed to corner them. Content in imminant victory, Daun revealed that it was a still breathing Javier Vanderspool that had put the price on their heads, as well as the rest of the Heavens' Devils. However, Daun's overconfidence got the better of him and Raynor managed to shoot him, downing him. A victory of sorts, but potentially a hollow one, as the authorities were closing in on their position. Making ammends for his previous deception, Findlay held them off long enough for Raynor to escape. Even nearly a decade later, Raynor would feel to be in his friend's debt for this sacrifice.Devil's Due  Remembering Hammond's offer, Raynor visited his friend on Mar Sara. Hammond, now the colony's magistrate, offered him the position of marshal in return for clemency, seeing Raynor's background as a useful commodity for a life in law enforcement. Raynor told him he'd consider it, but first, there was something else he had to do. Something that he'd been planning ever since he'd escaped Bacchus Moon. And after months of planning and research, he finally managed to gain access to that something\u2014Javier Vanderspool, confined to an iron lung after his wound in Korsy, but still malignant. The two men confronted each other, six years of mutual loathing bubbling to the surface. Vanderspool tried to bribe Raynor, even begged him to spare his life. Raynor would have none of it however, knowing that Vanderspool was still as dangerous as he was back on Turaxis II and would always be so, he shot Vanderspool dead. Not in anger, but in justice. Remembering his father's words, Raynor left the Colt on what had become Vanderspool's coffin and walked away. He could be who he chose to be.Civilian Life  After his ordeal with Vanderspool, Raynor returned to Mar Sara. At Janine's, he met Liddy, the two quickly warming to each other. They married soon afterwards and settled down as a couple. It wasn't long before Liddy was pregnant with their son, Johnny. The bought a house in the Diamondback Wastelands, though had to take out a large mortgage. Jim Raynor accepted Hammond's offer in 2496\u2014Hammond accepted, making Raynor a marshal and erasing his army record. However, he was disliked by his fellow law enforcement officers, such as sheriff Glenn McAaron, who thought he was still a criminal at heart. Raynor was assigned to transport a group of criminals to El Indio Prison, across a stretch of lawless land named Perdition's Crossing. However, along the way he ran across a scientific transport raided by a band of slavers named the Mazor gang, lead by a criminal named Mazor. Raynor offered his three prisoners a chance at redemption as he had if they would help him save the prisoners. The prisoners accepted, and raided the camp, but two of his prisoners, T-Bone Smalls and Rodney Oseen, betrayed Raynor and knocked him unconscious. The third prisoner, Marduke Saul, stayed true to his word however, and knocked out the two other prisoners and killed Mazor before he could kill Jim Raynor. True to his word, Raynor allowed Saul to be free while taking Smalls and Oseen to El Indio Prison. Raynor would later state that his tough guy reputation was such he never had to shoot any criminals, a statement contradicted by his actions at Perdition's Crossing. Lidya made Jim promise to always stand up for what he believed in. John was later born, and was considered \"gifted\" with psychic powers by the Tarsonis Institute of Health and Researchand in 2498, requested the Raynors hand over their son. Jim didn't like the idea, but Lidya believed Jim's distrust of the Confederacy was unwarranted. Months later, they received a letter from the institute saying John had been killed in a shuttle accident. Lidya, blaming herself, died of grief. Jim Raynor buried himself in his work to escape his losses. He learned how to describe plots for potential colony use as well.The Great War  Raynor was 29 years old when the protoss attacked his world's neighbor, Chau Sara, sparking the Great War. In the wake of the attack and the beginning of the zerg incursion on Mar Sara, Raynor received orders from the Office of the Colonial Magistrate to escort the core Mar Saran colonists to the outlying wastelands. Here he was partnered with the new Magistrate of the colony, with whom he would share a close working relationship. While safeguarding the colonists, the evacuation base received a distress signal from Backwater Station. Alpha Squadron commander Edmund Duke ordered the colonials to ignore it, saying that Alpha Squadron would handle it. However, Raynor believed that Confederate forces would be unable to respond in time, and set off to relieve Backwater in defiance of orders, the Magistrate sending in some militia as support. During a lull in the battle, he rescued Universe News Network reporter Michael Liberty at Anthem Base, who then joined the party. Arriving at Backwater they successfully drove the zerg from the immediate area and destroyed a nearby infested command center. However, this put them at odds with Duke. Raynor and his men were subsequently arrested for destroying Confederate property and taken to the prison ship Merrimack.The Sons of Korhal  Michael Liberty and a Sons of Korhal task force boarded Merrimack and rescued Raynor and the Mar Saran militia. Thoroughly dissatisfied with the Confederacy, and with the protoss sterilization of his homeworld imminent, it did not take Arcturus Mengsk much to persuade Raynor and the militia to join the dissident group. Raynor was awarded the rank of captain and assigned to lead the newest unit of the Sons of Korhal, unofficially named \"Raynor's Rangers\". He became acquainted with young Matt Horner, then second-in-command of the Cormorant, a Sons of Korhal merchantman which had assisted in the evacuation of Mar Sara. Raynor led a raid on the Jacobs Installation to access the Confederate network and retrieve what he believed to be weapon designs. Inside he discovered live zerg in captivity and was horrified when he realized that the Confederacy had known about the zerg but decided to keep that knowledge secret. In the aftermath, Raynor was ferried to the Hyperion, where he watched the protoss bombard the planet. He was sickened at the sight.The Antigan Revolution  The Sons of Korhal then withdrew to Antiga Prime, a border world whose colony was on the verge of revolt but effectively suppressed by Alpha Squadron. Along with a team of SoK members, Raynor and Liberty were assigned on a mission to free the Antigans from Alpha Squadron's grip. En route to the Confederate command center, they met Mengsk's second in command, Lieutenant Sarah Kerrigan. The meeting didn't go well. Raynor's first thoughts towards Kerrigan were desirous, but as she was a ghost, she could read his mind, and wasn't impressed by what she saw in it. Upon learning of Kerrigan's telepathic abilities, Raynor's attitude towards her soured in turn, as Kerrigan was a product of the Ghost Program. The same program that he'd lost his son to. Nonetheless, the mission was a success. The Antigans rose up and allied with the Sons of Korhal, and the local Alpha Squadron detachment was destroyed. Shortly afterward, Duke's command ship, Norad II, crash landed after a zerg attack in orbit and was then besieged by zerg forces on the ground. Raynor, under orders from Mengsk, unenthusiastically rescued the general, an act that directly precipitated Duke's and Alpha Squadron's defection to the rebellion. It was at this point that unease began to swell within Raynor. Although he believed in Mengsk's cause and felt indebted to him for his rescue from the Merrimack, he was uneasy at what Mengsk was asking of them. The fighting on Antiga Prime lasted for months, and over that time, Raynor and Kerrigan worked together many times, becoming a formidable team.The Trump Card  In the last days of Antiga Prime, Raynor, along with the rest of the Sons of Korhal, learnt of the arrival of the Confederate Delta Squadron and how the Sons of Korhal would use a psi emitter to send the zerg against the Confederates, allowing the rebels to escape the planet. With the Sons of Korhal preparing to evacuate the planet, Raynor led a force to rescue the remaining colonists. During the battle, the protoss and Executor Tassadar arrived and made contact with the terrans, even providing timely assistance.Push Toward Tarsonis  Raynor and the Sons of Korhal escaped from Antiga Prime and made their way to Tarsonis. The protoss then sterilized the world. Departing the planet, Raynor was disturbed, courtesy of Mengsk's hunger for power and his growing lack of scruples. Kerrigan was faring little better, haunted by her role in drawing the zerg to the planet. The two headed for the ship's galley for talk and coffee. Despite his history with telepaths, Raynor possessed genuine sympathy for Kerrigan. Sympathy gave way to mutual friendship and they grew close. At some point, Raynor was given or obtained a vidsnap of Kerrigan. Mengsk had noticed the improving relationship between Raynor and Kerrigan, and in the interim period between Antiga Prime and Tarsonis, dispatched them on a number of missions. The first involved Raynor with a Sons of Korhal team to the single moon of G-2275, in order to obtain goliath designs. Kerrigan, who had been at the facility the following year, was also present. The raid was successful. Next, Raynor and Kerrigan were sent to raid a science facility on Orna III. Kerrigan, who knew her way around the facility, pretended to be a ghost who had arrested the criminal Raynor. The deception worked. Several scientists and all the test subjects were rescued. The corrupt scientists were killed and the facility destroyed. Afterwards, Raynor offered her a drink and a real date at Sam's Place. One thing led to another, and the two gave into their emotions. That night, as they lay in bed, Kerrigan made Raynor promise that if the darkness in her ever went out of control, she would stop it. Mengsk voiced concern over their relationship, calling Kerrigan dangerous and nothing more than a weapon, which caused Raynor to begin to distrust of the general. Despite this, their relationship became strained over the issue of Mengsk. Raynor had come to realize that Mengsk was no better than the government he was trying to overthrow, that his rebellion was based more on a lust for power than justice. Kerrigan conceded part of the point, but still remained convinced that Mengsk could bring about a better future for humanity. She voiced her misgivings, wondering whether they should have ever begun a relationship at all. These were words that Raynor would reflect on for years.Tarsonis  Prior to their invasion of Tarsonis, the Sons of Korhal held a conference. Raynor remarked that he was \"impressed\" by Duke's strategy of frontally assaulting the central of the three primary orbital platforms. Once above the Confederate capital, General Duke led the attack to break through to the surface. Raynor, alongside Kerrigan and Liberty, found himself fighting tooth and nail in the streets of Tarsonis City. The means with which the rebellion would defeat the Confederacy became clear when Mengsk ordered Duke to activate psi-emitters on the secured space platforms. Raynor and Kerrigan protested the unleashing of the zerg on the Confederate capital but were coldly rebuffed by Mengsk. Raynor later brought his objections personally to Duke and Mengsk, coming to blows with the former. Anticipating trouble, he began gathering his men together. Raynor was angered and frustrated when Kerrigan was dispatched to defend the primary zerg hives at New Gettysburg from the pursuing protoss; Mengsk feared the protoss would prevent the zerg from delivering the fatal blow to the Confederacy. Raynor could not convince Kerrigan to refuse the order and later regretted not accompanying her.Raynor's Raiders  With Kerrigan's mission a success, the zerg suddenly began to attack her forces. To Raynor's disbelief, Mengsk ordered the Sons of Korhal to withdraw, abandoning Kerrigan and her troops instead of evacuating them. Raynor refused to obey orders, and he and Michael Liberty gathered the Rangers for a rescue attempt. They were intercepted on Hyperion by General Edmund Duke, and neurally resocialized marines using their stimpacks. Duke was prepared to arrest Raynor for mutiny, but was surprised by Liberty who injured the general with a needle gun. Duke's marines let the Rangers pass as they bore an unconscious Duke to a medical center. Horner was one of the first men to join Raynor as he left. Raynor attempted to rescue Kerrigan with a dropship but could not locate her. With the situation on the ground deteriorating, he instead evacuated a number of human troops. Mengsk's callousness led Raynor, the Commander, Liberty, and the remnants of the Mar Sara Colonial Militia to sever their ties with the megalomaniac Mengsk and the Sons of Korhal. Raynor was picked up by the former Confederate battlecruiser, the Thunder Child, on his way from Tarsonis. Raynor's Rangers, now known as Raynor's Raiders, had become a rebel movement of their own. The Raiders fought their way from Tarsonis, destroying the Ion cannon, before escaping out of the system. Although Liberty and the Commander left the Raiders, Raynor did not find himself without company. He had originally expected to be down to a handful of troops. Instead, virtually every member of his unit followed him, and even a few from outside it. Raynor soon found himself the head of a small army. But an army required transport, so to obtain it, Raynor led a raid on the Dylarian Shipyards, obtaining a number of transport vessels and the Hyperion itself. In the aftermath however, Raynor found himself without direction. While he'd made a few strikes against the forces of the Terran Dominion, he was at a loss as to how to proceed, especially with so many looking up to him. And the recurring dreams he was having weren't helping matters...Protoss Friendship  Six weeks after the fall of the Confederacy, Raynor's dreams led him to Char. The Raiders established themselves on Char, avoiding conflict with arriving Terran Dominion forces led by Duke, but were overrun by the zerg led by, much to Raynor's surprise and shock, Kerrigan. She'd been calling to him via her telepathy, but now possessed no desire to return to her former life. Kerrigan allowed Raynor to flee but the psychic connection between the two remained. However, Raynor and the surviving Raiders were temporarily stranded on Char when Kerrigan attacked the Raiders' ships. Hyperion was able to escape by making a risky emergency jump. Tassadar's forces arrived and began destroying the \"infested\" ships including escaping shuttles and escape pods. Raynor kept this knowledge from his men. Raynor used his tracking skills to find Tassadar (and his force) and, later, Zeratul. Despite initial animosity the three decided to cooperate out of necessity and fight the zerg together, aided by Raynor's psychic connection to Kerrigan; the mutual respect and friendship resulting from the alliance would be pivotal in the continuing struggle. Through the events that followed, Raynor gained an intimate knowledge of the zerg command structure, as well as of the history and differences in ways that binded together the Khalai and the Dark Templar. However, the motley force of Templar, Dark Templar, and Raiders were soon forced onto the defensive, with Tassadar's forces and Raynor ending up surrounded. There they awaited reinforcements which came in the form of a protoss fleet from Aiur sent to arrest Tassadar. The newcomers opted to join Tassadar instead. With the return of the Hyperion, the Raiders accompanied their protoss allies back to Aiur. On Aiur they were joined by Fenix who was rallying forces to resist the zerg invasion. Fenix would become another of Raynor's close friends. Raynor refused to be idle when Tassadar was arrested by the Conclave, and brought the Raiders into battle to help free him. The rescue succeeded with the timely intervention of Zeratul's Dark Templar. Raynor's Raiders joined Tassadar in the final assault that destroyed the Overmind.The Brood War  The death of the Overmind caused the zerg to rampage, killing seventy percent of Aiur's population. The only realistic option was for the protoss and the terrans to leave the planet through a warp gate to Shakuras. Raynor and Fenix remained behind covering the retreat, and for a time both were thought lost by their comrades. The two survived, with a small group of refugees on Aiur. They managed to establish an enclave on Aiur near a warp gate. Kerrigan contacted Raynor and Fenix there, warning them about the new Overmind and the UED's plan to control it. Raynor begrudgingly rescued Mengsk from the United Earth Directorate, traveling through the warp gate, which then self-destructed. They did so at the request of Kerrigan, who contacted them again on Shakuras. Assembling on Tarsonis, the four forged an uneasy alliance against the UED. Together they rescued the remains of the Dominion fleet from the UED. Raynor helped Kerrigan destroy the UED's psi disrupter and retake Korhal for the Dominion. After the victory on Korhal, Kerrigan promptly turned on her allies. Enraged and convinced of her treacherous nature, Raynor vowed to one day kill Kerrigan in righteous vengeance. In the aftermath of the Brood War, a grieving Raynor said his farewells to Zeratul on Shakuras, then vanished.Dark Times  Raynor continued his activities against the zerg after the Brood War. He was personally summoned by Artanis to aid in destroying the last renegade cerebrates under Kaloth on Braxis, and to help deliver an experimental nanite cure to the infested Alexei Stukov, who had been resurrected by the zerg. Alongside Praetor Taldarin, Raynor fought through Stukov\u2019s terran mercenaries and zerg broods, recruiting defectors and prisoners, including his old friend Bud Morris, along the way. Raynor\u2019s medics delivered the cure to Stukov, with the former vice-admiral expressing regret for losing the clarity the Swarm had given him. Raynor, Taldarin, Stukov and their forces escaped Braxis, as Artanis and his fleet purified the surface, ending the threat of Kaloth and his allied cerebrates. In the aftermath, Raynor pondered that if such a cure was possible, there my yet be hope to revert Kerrigan. At some point Raynor became affiliated with the Alliance, rising to the point of general and taking part in a mission on Dylar IV, though his time at a desk job did not do his physical state any favors. At some point he attempted an attack on Kerrigan, trying to make good on his vow to see her dead during the Brood War. However, this attack failed.Freedom Fighter  At some point, Raynor's Raiders attempted an attack on Kerrigan, trying to make good on Jim Raynor's vow to see her dead during the Brood War. However, this attack failed. In the end, exhausted and disillusioned, Raynor knew that his chances of achieving vengeance against Kerrigan were slender at best. He returned to terran space to lead the Raiders against the spreading power of the Dominion. Raynor networked and struck alliances with various anti-Dominion groups, including the Kel-Morian Combine, which he and his \"mob\" visited c. 2502. The Combine became very protective of this friendship. Raynor would frequently hide out on zerg-infested worlds.The War Pigs  In 2502 the director of the Dominion Internal Security Division, Tamsen Cauley, targeted Jim Raynor for assassination. Cauley believed this would increase his power, and contracted the outlaw War Pigs to do it. En route, the War Pigs' minds were read by Dark Templar. The Dark Templar warned the outlaws not to harm Raynor, before delivering a warning to Raynor about the impending attack.Raynor's Raiders were hiding on Urona Sigma, a zerg-infested world, within a water-access-only tunnel system. The protoss believed the planet to be lost, and the Raiders planned to leave before the purification. The War Pigs were captured by the forewarned Raiders. The War Pigs were led by Cole Hickson, Raynor's old friend. Raynor still trusted Hickson and left himself open to attack. Unknown to Raynor and the War Pigs, Hickson was altered by a subconscious form of neural resocialization to kill Raynor. As Raynor explained his relationship with Hickson, Hickson tried to shoot Raynor with a pistol. Raynor recognized Hickson's resocialization. The assassination was interrupted by a zerg attack. Raynor, separated from his crew, was forced to team up with the War Pigs. Together they escaped to the surface, with the War Pigs sealing the way behind them. However, Hickson ambushed Raynor again. Raynor made Hickson remember his sanity-saving techniques and the resocialization procedure. Hickson, overcome with stress, fell to the ground screaming. At that moment, the protoss began the purification of Urona Sigma. Raynor and the War Pigs were trapped on the surface, away from the Raiders' dropships and the War Pigs' transport vessel. The protoss only purified the area away from Raynor and the War Pigs (which was also the area of heaviest zerg concentration). While Raynor and the War Pigs prepared for the end, Romy Pyrius took his \"best\" drugs. Lars Trakken, unable to contain his hatred of Cole Hickson, descended to the surface with a dropship full of Cerberus heavies. He offered to take Hickson but leave the rest of the War Pigs. Raynor noted the odd behavior \u2013 Trakken could have just let the purification kill them \u2013 and proposed a ruse which would enable them to steal the dropship. They pretended to hand over the unconscious Hickson. While Trakken was distracted expressing his rage, Hickson awoke and began grappling with Trakken as Raynor and the War Pigs began killing Cerberus troopers. Then the zerg appeared on the battlefield. Pyrius rescued Hickson and injured Trakken, causing the latter to fall to the zerg. However, Pyrius was killed during the escape. Raynor and the surviving War Pigs made it to the General Lee, where Raynor revealed he believed the protoss were not attempting to kill them, but instead knew what was coming and had simply let the situation play out.Prelude to the War  Raynor's fight against the Dominion did not go well, Mengsk utilizing the state-controlled media, oratory and propaganda to marginalize Raynor's efforts. With Raynor and his faction viewed as a terrorist organization and \"public enemy number one,\" Mengsk took steps to keep Raynor and his followers constantly hunted and harried and deny them any chance to gain a respite and build their strength. While Mengsk refused to have Raynor assassinated in fear of turning him into a martyr, he forced Raynor to take up mercenary work to make the cut. That a price of 500,000 credits had been put on his head for crimes of mass murder, terrorism, sabotage, rebellion, incitement, grand larceny, piracy and sedition didn't help matters either. He was especially unpopular amongst Dominion marines, who would use his visage for target practice on firing ranges. Recruitment drives demonized him in a similar manner. Four years after the Brood War, Raynor was still active in the sector, though had begun losing faith, drinking heavily and blaming himself for Kerrigan's being taken by the zerg. His hatred for Mengsk became a festering wound. Horner still believed in him and in the revolution even though some of Raynor's doubts were spreading to his crew. Horner did a lot to keep things going over the years, always having faith that Raynor's innate heroism would resurface and lead the rebels to victory. And all the while, there was the matter of Kerrigan. Those who knew Raynor best knew that one part of the rebel wouldn't stop until she was dead. And that the other part refused to let go. Raynor's feelings about Kerrigan changed over the years, in part because she had been away and wasn't continually stoking his anger.Second Great War Return to Mar Sara  Raynor returned to his old home on Mar Sara, digging up mementos and reminiscing about his wife and child. He then turned up at Joeyray's Bar, where he watched a news report about the Terran Dominion annexing Mar Sara. Raynor admitted to the bartender that he wouldn't stop fighting until his ghosts lay silent. Raynor listened to a UNN newscast by Kate Lockwell as Mengsk described him as a terrorist. An angry Raynor shot one of the TV screens, then confirmed with his adjutant that the Raiders were in position to liberate Mar Sara. Raynor personally led the assault on Backwater Station, where the Dominion was enslaving civilians and forcing them to work in a mine. The station was liberated and Mar Sara declared independence from the Dominion. Not long after these events, Raynor reunited with his old friend, Tychus Findlay, at Joeyray's Bar. His companion offered him a business proposition to \"liberate\" alien artifacts from the Dominion to sell to the Moebius Foundation. After some bargaining, Raynor agreed. They were successful in recovering an artifact. Not long after this however, the zerg launched an invasion of Mar Sara. Raynor and Findlay escaped on the Hyperion, but learned from Horner that the invasion of Mar Sara was simply part of a wider zerg offensive against terran space. Caught up in the conflict, Raynor was presented with the choice of answering a distress call from Agria or retrieving another artifact located on Monlyth. Note that some overlap may be present for the following sections, which have been grouped through a combination of 'sagas' and DVD order.The Colonists of Agria  The Raiders aided the world of Agria, which had been abandoned by the Dominion. After the evacuation, Doctor Ariel Hanson joined the Raiders. Hanson developed romantic feelings towards Raynor over the course of her stay, but Raynor was clueless to this. Raynor helped Hanson's people again on Meinhoff and they found new sanctuary on Haven. Suddenly, all communications were cut off, and upon arrival, Raynor discovered why\u2014a protoss force under Executor Selendis had arrived, knowing that the colonists were infected. Hanson however, maintained that she was close to finding a cure for the virus and both Hanson and Selendis vied for Raynor's allegiance. Raynor decided to aid the colonists and fended off the protoss. Afterwards, Hanson decided to stay on Haven to help her people. She tentatively offered Raynor a new life on the world, but the rebel maintained that he had to finish what he'd started\u2014his revolution against Mengsk. Hanson revealed her affections, but accepted Raynor's decision. Raynor decided that the colonists could not be saved and agreed to purify Haven himself. Hanson saw it as a betrayal, and locked herself into the lab. The infestation was terminated, although a problem appeared into the lab. Raynor was forced to hunt and kill an infested Hanson.Artifact Hunt  On Monlyth, the protoss present, the Tal'darim, refused to turn the artifact over to Raynor and to make matters worse, the Zerg Swarm had arrived with the intention of retrieving the artifact as well. The Raiders managed to retrieve the artifact, prompting an annoyed Kerrigan to contact Raynor. She would not forget his perchance for resourcefulness a second time. Raynor once again encountered the Tal'darim on Xil, a world that housed a xel'naga temple, succeeding where the Moebius Foundation failed and retrieving the artifact inside. Findlay was pleased with the catch and the pay it would bring, but Raynor was less enthusiastic, wondering if retrieving the artifacts was worth his men's lives.Tidings of Doom  One protoss who wasn't interested in achieving vengeance on Raynor was Zeratul, who confronted the rebel on the Hyperion. He warned of an impending disaster and how Kerrigan was the key to preventing it. Raynor received an ihan crystal containing the dark templar's investigations. Zeratul implored the rebel to study it before swiftly departing. Raynor followed Zeratul's demands, and saw Zeratul's encounter with Kerrigan on Ulaan, learning of a prophecy which was later deciphered by preservers on Zhakul. Seeing a vision of the Overmind given to Zeratul by Tassadar's spirit, Raynor learned of the impending threat of the hybrids, and that Kerrigan was the only one who could save them. Despite Kerrigan's apparent role as saviour, her role in the present was anything but. She attacked the Moebius Foundation base at Tyrador VIII, intending to learn the location of the artifacts. However, Doctor Emil Narud hired Raynor's Raiders to destroy their data cores before Kerrigan could get to them. Afterward, Raynor suffered from a depression, blaming himself for what had happened to Kerrigan.Spectres  Gabriel Tosh contracted the Raiders to retrieve jorium-rich minerals from Redstone III and then terrazine from Bel'Shir, a move which aggravated the Tal'darim forces present on the world. Afterward, Matt Horner received a transmission from an unknown source, explaining terrazine's uses to enhance ghosts into spectres and accusing Tosh of being a threat to Raynor. Tosh admitted to being a spectre, but claimed the transmission came from the Terran Dominion in an attempt to divide them. Raynor agreed to let the matter pass, but wasn't sure if he could trust Tosh. Finally, Tosh tried to hire Raynor for a new mission: rescuing prisoners from New Folsom Prison. However, Nova, a Dominion ghost, contacted Raynor and told him Tosh wanted to rescue former spectres and turn them loose. They would invariably turn into psychopaths. She offered to turn over ghost technology to Raynor if he would instead attack Tosh's operation. Raynor had to choose whom to trust. Choosing Tosh's word over that of a Dominion assassin, Raynor directed the attack against the prison, releasing its prisoners. Horner was jubilant at the release of Mengsk's political opponents, while Tosh was far more cynical, reasoning that even if Mengsk was overthrown, another dictator would take his place. Raynor still believed in Horner's vision, but realized that vengeance against Mengsk was all he had left. Unable to trust Tosh and fearing the release of psychopathic spectres across the Sector, Raynor sided with Nova. His forces attacked Tosh's Goons at Avernus Station, destroying his spectre-creation facilities. Contacted by Tosh, Raynor watched as the spectre attempted to use voodoo on him, but it affected someone else. Threatening Tosh, who was feeling safe 6 light years away, Raynor watched as Nova sneaked from behind and killed him.Hearts and Minds  Horner told Raynor about an opportunity on Tarsonis\u2014the Dominion was excavating old Confederate technology there and moving it via lightly-defended trains. They planned a train robbery, giving them access to a Confederate adjutant. The adjutant considered Raynor a criminal and would not give up information, but Raynor knew of an old contact of his, Colonel Orlan, who was an expert at decrypting computers. However, Horner's \"wife\", Mira Han, knew that Orlan had double-crossed him. She offered the services of her mercenaries, but only if Raynor could meet her price before Orlan did. Raynor was able to do so, and the combined mercenaries and Raiders force defeated Orlan and captured him. He was forced to hand over the adjutant, which had recorded a conversation between Mengsk, Raynor and Kerrigan when he betrayed her. Han had another tip for Raynor: the Dominion was testing a new weapon of war, the Odin, at Valhalla. Raynor and Horner decided to steal it; they could use it to deliver the Confederate adjutant's information to the Dominion citizenry. The mission was successful; Tychus Findlay stole the Odin and used it to destroy five Dominion bases. The Dominion was unaware of the nature of the attack and had no idea their weapon had been subverted. Finally, the Odin was transported to Korhal, where Findlay took it on a rampage. During the battle, the Raiders uploaded the adjutant's information to UNN towers. This prompted Dominion civilians to revolt. While assaulting Korhal, the Raiders destroyed a science facility which held information about a secret installation on Castanar. Raynor led a small force to raid the installation, using the security overrides to get past obstacles. Finding a protoss/zerg hybrid cloned over and over, Rayor destroyed the facility's fusion reactor, but released a powerful hybrid and was forced to run from the facility using a Hercules dropship.Dealing with the Devil  Raynor pressed on, capturing yet another artifact from Typhon XI. When he took the Hyperion to the Moebius Foundation meeting coordinates, they instead encountered Dominion ships led by the Bucephalus, Mengsk's flagship. Against Horner's advice, Raynor ordered Hyperion alongside for a boarding action. Raynor and Tychus Findlay led the charge. The rebel leader broke into Mengsk's chambers intending to execute his long-time nemesis, and his pistol was loaded with a single bullet for the purpose. However, Raynor found Crown Prince Valerian Mengsk, who revealed he owned the Moebius Foundation, and the Raiders were unwittingly working for him. Furthermore, Valerian offered an alliance against the zerg; he believed a device could be created from the artifacts to deinfest Kerrigan. Raynor agreed to work with Valerian. This action provoked resentment from both Findlay and Horner, the former wishing Kerrigan dead, the latter thinking Raynor's emotions were clouding his judgment. Many other Raiders were also resentful of the alliance. Raynor still pressed ahead, acquiring the final artifact from a xel'naga worldship defended by the Tal'darim Executor. He regained the respect and loyalty of the crew by beating a fully-armored Findlay in a bar fight, and convincing them that a successful revolution also required the zerg to be dealt with. The crew were particularly impressed by the resurgence of Raynor's determinationThe Return to Char  Valerian intended to invade Char, a dangerous proposition. He took half the Dominion fleet with him, along with General Horace Warfield. Mengsk contacted him and told him he was in over his head. However, Valerian stood beside Raynor, telling his father he would defeat Kerrigan, something his father could never do. Raynor's forces landed on Char, establishing a foothold. They also managed to rescue Warfield, whose battlecruiser had crashed onto Char's surface. Afterward, they had to decide which method they would use to weaken Kerrigan's reinforcements; Raynor proposed assaulting tunnels that he was familiar with, destroying the nydus network. Warfield preferred to attack a massive space platform over Char instead. After weakening Kerrigan's forces, Raynor moved forward, taking the artifact near Kerrigan's primary hive. The artifact's power enabled it to destroy massive numbers of zerg, but Kerrigan's forces were still numerous and she herself attacked Raynor's base. Eventually the artifact completely charged up, unleashing its power, killing vast numbers of zerg and deinfesting Kerrigan. By the time Raynor entered Kerrigan's hive, he was commited to what he was about to do\u2014 to save Kerrigan, and not look back. It was faith that was rewared, as Raynor and Findlay found Kerrigan deinfested. While Raynor was amazed to see her human again, Findlay, under orders from Mengsk, tried to kill her. Raynor stopped Findlay's attempt and shot him with his revolver, using the bullet intended only for Mengsk.Flashpoint  Raynor was left shaken by what had just happened, but nonetheless ordered that Findlay's body be left behind, so embittered he was by his friend's betrayal. Contacting Horner, he ordered that a dropship be sent to retrieve them\u2014a task that wouldn't be easy, because while the zerg had just lost their queen, they were reverting to their primal instincts and ergo, were still a threat. Subsequently, Raynor took Kerrigan out of the hive, walking slowly across the battlefield and offering her comfort. However, Kerrigan had been severely weakened by the de-infestation process, and now in human form, found herself choking on Char's inhospitable air. Raynor had her protected by insulweave, but despite ordering his men to treat her like a human being rather than the monster she had once been, was left with similar misgivings himself. Yet at the end of the day, he was glad she was alive. Making their way to the drop zone, Raynor and his fellow Raiders were forced to fight a running battle with the zerg, a task not made easy in that he had to carry and protect Kerrigan at the same time. Still, they managed to make it to the dropship, but had to land on the Bucephalus, to give Kerrigan medical treatment. The situation was tense on the ship, not helped by the level of distrust that still existed between Raynor and Valerian. To make matters worse, the undamaged half of the Dominion Armada arrived in the Char System, led by Arcturus Mengsk in the White Star. The elder Mengsk demanded that Valerian turn over Kerrigan, but he refused, for like Raynor, he knew of the prophecy that pointed to the need for Kerrigan's survival. In the ensuing battle, the Hyperion and Bucephalus managed to escape. Raynor suggested hiding out at Dead Man's Rock, under Mira Han's protection. They hid their ships there and met Dr Emil Narud. Due to an ambush planned by one of Han's men however, the group had to flee again, traveling to Space Station Prometheus. There, Valerian and Raynor dined with their benefactor, but Narud betrayed them, revealing his true affiliation with Arcturus Mengsk. The rebel battlecruisers could not help due to sabotage from \"repair teams,\" and to make matters worse, the Dominion Armada arrived in the area. Mengsk contacted the station, telling his son and enemy that he'd spare their lives in exchange for Kerrigan's. However, Raynor and co. managed to escape on their own terms, though Narud escaped with the artifact that had de-infested her. Escaping the station, Raynor accepted Valerian's offer of taking Kerrigan to a top-secret Umojan space platform.Heart of the Swarm  Raynor became torn over Kerrigan's past actions as the Queen of Blades. On one hand he rationalized that she wasn't completely in control, but on the other he could not forget the crimes she had committed, including the death of Fenix. Three weeks after the Battle of Char, Raynor wanted to take Kerrigan away from the research lab, ready to start a new life together. After a final test, the two met face to face. Raynor reassured Kerrigan that Findlay's death wasn't her fault, and that she was not the same individual as the Queen of Blades, the one who had slaughtered millions. He left to get suited up. Before he could return however, a Dominion force arrived, intent on terminating Kerrigan. He witnessed her eliminate her would-be assassins. The two fled the base, but were separated when the Archangel destroyed a bridge that Raynor had yet to cross. Raynor was captured by Nova. Mengsk publicly announced that Raynor was dead, but secretly kept him alive in case Kerrigan returned. He was transferred to the prison ship Moros, but was freed when Kerrigan and her swarm attacked the ship. Raynor was horrified and disgusted to see that she had willingly reinfested herself, condemning her for Fenix's murder, as well as the deaths of millions more. Kerrigan moved his gun to her forehead, and told him that he was the one who swore to kill her, but that he also had been the only person who ever believed in her. She asked him if he still believed in her. Raynor hesitated and then fired, shooting to miss. Kerrigan told him that she would always love him as Raynor told her they were done, and walked off. Raynor was placed in the medbay of the Hyperion, but refused to talk to anyone. Events moved on ahead regardless however, as Kerrigan took her zerg to Korhal with the Hyperion following to provide evacuation for civilians. Raynor eventually came to realize that Kerrigan was not the same Queen of Blades she used to be after witnessing her intentionally hinder her own plans for the invasion of Korhal in order to minimize civilian casualties. He eventually decided to commit the Raiders to assist in her final attack on Mengsk's palace while Valerian and Horner continued with civilian evacuation. He managed to intervene in time to save Kerrigan before Mengsk could use the Keystone to kill her and crushed Mengsk's remote control. Kerrigan then finished off Mengsk by infusing him with psionic energy, causing him to violently explode, ending the tyrant's oppressive reign. Kerrigan thanked Raynor for his help as the Zerg Swarm departed Korhal, and departed with them. Watching her depart, Raynor commented that it had been his pleasure. And it always had been.Interbellum  With the collapse of Mengsk's regime, Raynor directed his attention (and those of the Raiders) to rebuilding terran civilization in the Koprulu sector. He worked with Valerian to reform the Dominion, and ensure it had a just government. With Mengsk dead, and Kerrigan's mind freed, he readied his forces for Amon's coming. He was given the position of \"commander\" (or retained it) in the Dominion Armed Forces.Legacy of the Void Attack on Korhal  In the early stages of the End War, Korhal was besieged by Moebius Corps, under the command of Amon. Raynor rallied the Hyperion and a group of battlecruisers to the planet's defense, but had only just managed to hold them at bay. Assistant arrived in the form of Artanis, who came in the arkship Spear of Adun. Artanis sought the Keystone, but offered aid to Raynor and his forces in defending Korhal. However, Moebius Corps attacked the space platform Sky Shield and disabled its atmospheric stabilizer with the objective of crashing the platform into Augustgrad. The Daelaam cleared the stabilizers while Raynor sent repair crews to stabilize the platform. With the two forces combined, Sky Shield was repaired before it impacted the planet, and Raynor turned control of the platform to Horner. However, Raynor discovered that Moebius Corps had raided Korhal Palace in the confusion and had made preparations to ship the Keystone offworld. Raynor lead a force to Bennet Port, with the support of Valerian and Artanis, to stop Moebius Corps and their hybrid masters, but the hybrid channeled psionic energy into the keystone, stunning all terrans on the field. The protoss fought through this psionic disturbance, preventing Raynor's forces from falling to the hybrid. The Keystone was retrieved, and Moebius Corps was pushed off world, but at a great cost; Korhal had been devastated far worse then it had during the zerg's previous invasions. While Valerian and Horner tended to the wounded and dying, Raynor buried the dead defenders of the city. He discussed the conflict with Artanis, and stated that if Zeratul believed in him, he could end this conflict with Amon. Artanis left for his arkship, leaving Raynor to rebuild Augustgrad. Raynor assigned Swann to give the Daelaam all information they had on the Keystone and Narud.Allied Commanders  Raynor commanded terran forces alongside fellow commanders during the End War.Into the Void  Two years after Amon was banished back into the Void, Raynor was summoned by Kerrigan alongside Artanis and Selendis, the four met to discuss the final destruction of Amon; who the protoss had sent back to the Void. Kerrigan revealed that a mysterious voice had been calling out to her since Amon's destruction. Originally believing it to be Amon himself, she later was able to sense that the force was benevolent and could be the key to destroying Amon. Bring a portion of the Dominion fleet with him, Raynor and Horner pushed into the Void alongside their allies. As their forces delved further through Amon's realm, Artanis discovered that the voice seemed to be that of the deceased Tassadar. Finding Samir Duran to be alive within the Void, Raynor and his allies pushed through hostile void thrashers and shadows of the Void to reach him, allowing Alexei Stukov to deliver the final blow. Freeing the voice from Narud's grasp, the allies discovered that source of the voice was revealed to not be Tassadar, but the xel'naga Ouros. Revealing that he had used Tassadar's image to influence Zeratul on Aiur and to urge Artanis to find him; Ouros stated that Kerrigan was the only one who would be able to kill Amon. Ouros stated that he would give his essence to Kerrigan and thus put an end to the eternal cycle of the xel'naga with his and Amon's death, though this revelation disturbed Raynor. Having witnessed Kerrigan be mutilated and changed through her life, he urged her to reconsider and find a different way, though she could not be swayed. Unable to talk her down, Raynor resolved to protect her as she absorbed the xel'naga's power. Holding out against waves of void apparitions alongside Broodmother Zagara and Artanis, Raynor's forces were ultimately tasked with ensuring that the greater plateau did not fall. Successful, Kerrigan ascended into a xel'naga. In the moments after her transformation, she visited Raynor's mind in her pre-infestation form, stating that the moments they had together would be with her forever. Saddened, Raynor nodded and told her to finish the fight, and Kerrigan sped off to finally defeat Amon. Following Kerrigan as she delved further into the Void, Raynor and Artanis aided Kerrigan with destroying Amon's protective Void crystals in the final battle. Suffering losses as Amon ripped the ground from under the ally's command structures, the three forces were ultimately successful as Kerrigan delivered the final blow to Amon. Raynor was embraced in a white light.Reunion and Farewell  Following the destruction of Amon, the Dominion entered into a Golden Age under Valerian's reign, with Horner asserting the continued support of the Dominion military. Finding himself back in Joeyray's Bar on Mar Sara, Raynor found himself in reflection, alone. Staring at his Confederate marshal's badge, Raynor saw (or believed he saw) Sarah Kerrigan enter the bar, appearing as she had prior to her infestation. Kerrigan asked if he was ready to leave, to which Raynor smiled, stated he was, and headed out of the bar. Raynor was never seen again. Only his marshal's badge was found in the barOther Appearances Battle.net  As of October 9th 2005 the classic battle.net web site contained a hidden image of Kerrigan (as the Queen of Blades) saying \"Help me Jim Raynor...you're my only hope!\".

He is variably a marine, a vulture, or piloting the Hyperion battlecruiser. In Episode I he was first depicted piloting a vulture hover cycle, and later as a marine during the raid on Jacobs Installation. In Episode II he was seen as a vulture pilot once more, after Kerrigan's rebirth and her defeat of his forces. In Episode III he was first depicted as a vulture pilot once again and later represented by the battlecruiser Hyperion. In Brood War he also appeared in all three forms but was rarely a playable character. During the first mission of Episode IV Raynor was playable as a vulture, and was also notable for being the only time in Brood War that players could command an invincible hero. He reappeared in the secret mission Resurrection IV as a marine. Backed up by medics and capable of using a stimpack, he made a formidable hero.StarCraft II  Raynor appears as a hero unit in several missions with varying abilities. Raynor is also available as an announcer for StarCraft II multiplayer, and the rattlesnake logo from his armor is available as a spray.Achievements  Jim Raynor's regular portrait is available on battle.net for players who complete the Wings of Liberty achievement. His marine portrait is available for players who complete the Devoted Fan achievement by purchasing the Collector's Edition of Wings of Liberty. His \"geek\" portrait was briefly available in September, 2013.Other Games  Raynor appears as a hero unit in RISK: StarCraft. Raynor is a playable character in Heroes of the Storm. Raynor cameos in Overwatch as the protagonist/mascot of 16-bit Hero.Personality and Traits  Raynor is simple, honest, direct and passionate. He does what is right, even if it's the difficult choice. He won't go looking for trouble, but he won't run if it comes looking for him. Raynor developed a very close relationship with Tassadar, Zeratul and Fenix; Fenix considered him to be \"as valiant as any Templar. His close relationship allow many protoss to consider him like a brother. From there he was one of the few terrans to gain widespread trust and respect amongst the protoss, to the point of some considering him a hero as well. Raynor's musical preferences lie in country rock. As a teen, he wasn't fond of classical music. He doesn't hate easily, but when he does so, it's intense. His favorite drink is Scotty Bolger's Old No. 8 Whiskey, though it took some time to grow on him. Raynor is uncomfortable with formal wear, prefering casual clothes, but with rarely dress up for a formal occasion when necessary.Tactical Abilities  Raynor developed good leadership and excellent tactical acumen through practical experience; a lack of formal training allowed him to avoid the preconceived notions of \"accepted\" knowledge. Rather than plan in depth, Raynor is an excellent improviser able to achieve victory by using what is on hand.Zeratul recognized Raynor to be highly resourceful, and even Arcturus Mengsk considered Raynor a grave threat. He has a casual confidence in command that inspires others to follow him. Ariel Hanson commented that Raynor's knowledge of the protoss and zerg exceeds that of many other terrans, even \"experts.\" Raynor is competent in the operation of ground vehicles, able to operate \"just about anything\", as well as being an able pilot. In addition, Raynor was highly proficient with a revolver.Notes Character Development  Raynor is considered to be the overall lead character of the StarCraft storyline. Chris Metzen describes Raynor as an \"honest cop in a universe full of demigods walking around.\" He has no superpowers and isn't the brightest guy, but he's just a cool cat and doesn't give up. He is the \"loneliest person in the universe\" and his journey for redemption and rocky relationship with Kerrigan makes up the heart of the StarCraft universe in his mind. Metzen has hinted that Raynor's relationship with Kerrigan is drawn from personal experience, in regards to a man struggling with his own demons while saving a woman from her own.StarCraft  Jim Raynor was created by Chris Metzen and James Phinney. He is based on the undercover police officer of the same name in the film Rush. Metzen and voice actor Robert Clotworthy based his character in part on an image of a space cowboy riding a hover cycle. In Metzen's words, Raynor was originally conceived as a space cowboy with \"more space than cowboy.\" Clotworthy gave him a quiet, raspy voice to signify that he is a \"badass\"; it is up to the others to shut up and listen to him.StarCraft II  During development of StarCraft II, Chris Metzen considered portraying Raynor as a full-blown alcoholic. The idea was toned back, as he didn't want to portray Raynor as a man completely without hope. That aside, storyline that was cut from the game was a drinking problem for Raynor. Raynor would be shown to make mistakes even as the player successfully completed missions. Raynor would overcome his personal demons and find redemption. Such was Metzen's idea, but the development team reacted negatively, finding it unnecessary, citing issues of player empowerment. A number of individuals have expressed confusion as to the nature of Raynor's personality in Wings of Liberty, how in regards to his relationship with Kerrigan, he had apparently drifted from his vow to kill her. Writer Brian Kindregan has defended the shift, arguing that it was unlikely that Raynor would remain in \"emotional purgatory\" for four years, that it would be expected his attitude would change over this time. However, he did concede that because players did not experience this shift with Raynor as a character, confusion could arise from the two personalities. His middle name used to start with \"C\".Alternate Histories  Raynor's original StarCraft II bio differs significantly from current accounts of his actions in the Guild Wars. According to early accounts, he first met Tychus Findlay in the brig of Camp McIntyre on Mar Sara. Their first meeting was in the brig at Camp McIntyre while serving 30 days apiece for insubordination. Both men were listed as missing in action for almost nine months after a reconnaissance mission into Kel-Morian territory in the latter stages of the fighting on Mar Sara. Raynor succeeded where Findlay failed and escaped incarceration, eventually landing a position as marshal. In a \"what if?\" scenario for Co-op Missions, Findlay survived the Battle of Char and eventually mended his relationship with Raynor.Collectibles  The following Raynor collectibles are/were available:Thor  The thor is a huge and powerful terran mechanical siege walker. Despite the thor being smaller than the Odin, the thor is still heavily armed and armored, and known to be one of the most heavy and powerful mechanical units in the Dominion Armed Forces.Overview  Named after the Norse god of thunder, the thor is a class of siege-walker. Those in service during the Second Great War were more maneuverable than the Odin incarnation. Pilots of thors were referred to as \"controllers.\"Design  Heavy composite neosteel-ceramic armor protects the thor. The plates are modular and can be replaced easily if damaged, or exchanged for thicker versions depending on battlefield conditions. Designed to defeat high-explosive armor piercing rounds, as well as disrupt the searing beams of energy-based weapons, the thor's plating offers unparalleled protection to the pilot and the mech\u2019s internal systems. Its innermost layer has a heat-resistant kinetic mesh that prevents damage from shrapnel, slugs, or even sheared armor fragments.ATVX has also developed an \"immortality protocol,\" allowing a thor to repair itself in the field as long as its hull remains intact. The thor's cockpit is pressurized and protected by a military-grade steelglass canopy, as well as thick layers of composite neosteel-ceramic armor. At its center lies the pilot's seat, which helps prevent operator injuries through powerful inertial dampeners and a foam-padded six-point harness. Multiple gauges and screens monitor the mech's systems, and the main holographic display projects computer-generated imagery of the terrain. Were this screen to fail, the steelglass canopy has a fully integrated heads-up-display, a navigation screen, and a basic targeting system. Improving the Thor has become somewhat of an informal competition amongst Terran Dominion engineers. The Dominion's top brass is content to allow this trend to continue, as it results in more powerful siege walkers. Meanwhile, improvements in neosteel plating and innumerable upgrades made the thors of the Dominion Special Forces a signature achievement in weapons engineering. The Defenders of Man experimented with utilizing cloaking devices on thors in Davis's compound.System  The thor is equipped with different types of heavy weapons, and has enough artillery to take down an entire enemy army by itself. It is armed with four \"Thor's Hammer\" particle accelerators (two are fired from each arm). Originally, four 250mm strike cannons resided on its back, but these have since been replaced by Punisher cannons. These fire 250mm anti-aircraft shells fitted with advanced electronics to minimize wasted shots. Their depleted uranium cores allow them to punch through the plating of heavily armored aerial targets, causing serious damage. Each shell is individually chambered by a basic auto-loading mechanism that simplifies maintenance and repairs. The cannons' rate of fire is capped to avoid malfunctions and to extend the service life of the ordnance. Bypassing the limit is not recommended, as the cannons may melt or explode. For aerial opponents, the thor is equipped with Javelin missile launchers. These are located on both sides of the steelglass canopy, and fire four small, IFF fragmentation warheads that can rip through multiple, lightly armored aerial targets on a single salvo. Due to the missiles\u2019 small size, the thor can carry a large payload, ensuring it will be fully prepared to deal with groups of flying bogeys even in drawn-out engagements. The thor can be optionally outfitted with 330mm barrage cannons.History  The thor stemmed from the Terran Dominion Thor Project, a program that resulted in the creation of the Odin. When the thor made its public debut, military analysts were stunned, and embedded UNN reporters described it as \"a huge bipedal war machine armed with a dorsal artillery that wouldn't be out of place on a battleship.\" Thors were being used in the field by 2502. During the Second Great War, the Terran Dominion utilized the thor in defending areas such as New Folsom Prison. The Odin, a particularly powerful prototype, was developed by 2503. A Protectorate shadowguard stole intelligence on the Odin, which was later taken to Valhalla. After years of fervent exploration, the Umojan Protectorate finally came up with its answer to the thor. Its impressiveness is only matched by the number of Umojan symbols it sports.Criminal Acquisitions  Mira's Marauders long sought a thor of their own, but construction routines reguarly set them back. Chief Engineer Rory Swann reverse-engineered a schematic of the thor from examining the Odin prototype. He refined a design that had millions of credits of R&D poured into it. His efforts focused on making it cheaper. The Raiders received their first thors during the attack on the UNN Studios.Game Unit  The thor can be transported by the Hercules dropship and medivac dropships. One thor fills up the medivac's entire capacity, transforming into a cube-like shape and hanging from underneath. As of StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm, the thor can switch between Javelin missiles (which destroy light air units) and Punisher cannons (which are single-target attacks designed to take on powerful air units). A thor's primary role is to act as the spearhead: a big tough unit that can push past an artillery barrage or fortified positions or push into an enemy base and lead marines into battle. Its other primary role is to defend allied units from air attacks with its powerful anti-air weaponry. It works well against light air units like mutalisks, but the attack is not as effective against heavily armored air units such as battlecruisers. The thor is one of the only terran units that can withstand a single nuclear missile strike besides battlecruisers. The thor is countered by range, mobility, and certain anti-armor units. It doesn't deal splash damage to ground units, therefore, it cannot effectively deal with massed units such as marines, zerglings, and zealots. A popular strategy with the unit is the \"thor harass\" (sometimes called \"thorship\"), similar to the reaver harass of StarCraft. It involves pairing the thor with a medivac dropship, combining the thor's power and the mobility of the latter. Some features that existed on the thor in previous builds led to a concern that its role was overlapping with that of the siege tank. Unlike the siege tank, the thor is an assault unit rather than a siege unit. Its ground attack has much less range than a siege tank's 180 mm cannon, so it is exposed to enemy fire while attacking. Another difference from the siege tank is that the thor can also function as a ground to air attacker.Wings of Liberty  The thor can be unlocked after playing the mission \"Media Blitz,\" and made available after Chief Engineer Rory Swann scanned the schematics of the Odin and made it less expensive to produce.Co-op Missions  Thors are exclusive to Rory Swann in Co-op Missions, unlocked once he reaches Level 6.Quotations Known Thor Pilots Known Thor Variants Notes Nova Terra  November Annabella \"Nova\" Terra (designation: Agent X41822N) is a ghost who served the Terran Dominion.Biography Early Life  November \"Nova\" Terra was a member of the Terra family, one of the Terran Confederacy's rich and powerful \"Old Families\". She is the youngest child of Bella and Constantino Terra, and had two siblings -- Clara and Zeb. The family lived in the Terra Skyscraper in Tarsonis City, Tarsonis. She possessed a degree of empathy that was generally lacking in the Old Families, a trait that did not go unnoticed. She also believed strongly in the concept of fair play. She was regarded as the \"golden child\" of the family. Unknown to Nova, much of her empathy was attributed to her telepathic abilities. Her father, Constantino, was aware of her abilities, if not the full extent of them. Without training she could only sense emotions and at seven years of age was told that she was \"empathetic\". Normally, psychic children were conscripted into the Ghost Program by wranglers. However, Constantino and Bella kept Nova's abilities a secret, even from Nova herself, telling Nova that she was naturally \"empathic\". At her fifteenth birthday party, Nova learned that she was psychic by reading the lecherous thoughts of Morgan Calabas, a \"suitor\".Betrayal and Flight  The Old Families began planning to send some of their children away from Tarsonis to the relative safety of a resort on Tyrador IX, due to the rising number of attacks against the Old Families and the escalating war the Confederacy found itself in against alien invaders and numerous rebel groups such as the Sons of Korhal. Nova Terra's parents agreed to send her away. Despite her protests, and Edward Peters' support, three days after her fifteenth birthday party she boarded a vessel for Tyrador IX. However, Nova felt her parents' minds as they were killed by anti-Confederate rebels and she quickly disembarked. Nova returned to find that Edward Peters, Gustavo McBain, and other rebels were murdering her family and their employees. Peters ordered McBain to shoot Nova but now, with her psychic powers elevated by the mental stress caused by the carnage she had just witnessed, she unleashed powerful telepathic and telekinetic abilities without any control. A large section of the Terra Skyscraper was destroyed, and all of her would-be murderers, as well as many hundreds of nearby people, were killed. Nova then fled to \"the Gutter\", as far away from her former life as possible. The trauma of recent events led her close to suicide. The destructive spectacle was proof enough that Nova Terra would be a valuable addition to the Ghost Program. Director Ilsa Killiany ordered wrangler Malcolm \"Mal\" Kelerchian to bring Nova in, assigning her the code X41822N even though the wayward psychic was not yet formally part of the Program.The Gutter  Shortly after Nova Terra arrived in the Gutter, two men attempted to rape her. They were unsuccessful and severely injured by Terra's telekinesis. The goons worked for the crime lord of the Gutter, Julius Antoine \"Fagin\" Dale. Monitoring her through traffic monitors, Fagin resolved to \"acquire\" her for her psychic abilities and, deducing from her expensive clothing, a ransom. Terra was brought before Fagin but, despite being in a fragile state of mind, refused to serve him. Reading minds she realized that Fagin's chief lieutenant, Markus Ralian, wanted him dead. However, Terra was unable to intimidate Fagin nor provoke him to kill her. Instead, Fagin let Terra go and ordered the shopkeepers not to feed her. Fagin was confident that starvation would force Terra to serve him. Four days later Nova gave up on starvation. While seeking food, she saw a UNN newscast featuring Clara Terra, who claimed that her entire family had been killed. Nova lashed out mentally. Fagin, who was watching through cameras, learned Nova Terra's true identity. Realizing that he would be unable to ransom her, as he would be destroyed by the retaliation of the Old Families, he ordered a reliable enforcer, \"the Pitcher\", to kill her. Despite four days of starvation and partial dehydration Nova Terra easily killed the Pitcher by destroying his brain with her mental powers. She carried on by stealing food and resolved to go after Fagin for ordering her death. Fagin responded by acquiring a psi-screen from Confederate Army Supply Sergeant Morwood (the device rendered him immune to telepathy), then surrounded himself with insane heavily armed guards, drug addicts who desperately needed a fix, and children. Although distracted by the thoughts of the drug addicts Terra defeated the ambushing gunmen and confronted Fagin again. Fagin ordered his men to kill the children one by one until she surrendered while he used his psi-screen to torture Terra at range. Unable to bear more, Terra surrendered.Escape from Madness  Fagin used Nova as a \"loyalty detector\" and assassin. Those who failed to pass Terra's test were murdered. She was prevented from going outside which made it difficult for Malcolm Kelerchian and his allies to locate her. Over that same time Fagin had become progressively more unpredictable, killing people, even his own children, almost on a whim, due to overuse of the psi-screen. Markus Ralian's desire for Fagin's death only grew, but he could not bring himself to do it. Terra had no trouble reading this from his mind. Terra knew the psi-screen couldn't protect Fagin from her telekinesis, but she never had the opportunity to use it on him. Meanwhile Agent Kelerchian discovered her location from contacts in the police force. To help him secure Terra, he was ordered by Ilsa Killiany to take with him Major Esmerelda Ndoci and her \"Annihilators\", a marine unit ill-suited for such a delicate mission but they were all that was available. The Sons of Korhal offensive on Tarsonis' space platforms were not an ideal theater for a ground-based unit like the Annihilators. With ghosts in short supply acquiring a powerful psychic was an \"alpha priority\" and they were ordered to bring Terra in unharmed. Kelerchian resolved to bargain with Fagin first, and if that failed then he would \"summon the marines\". As the wrangler discovered, Fagin's mental faculties made bargaining difficult if not impossible. As the crime lord ranted Terra used her powers, forcing Ralian to shoot and kill Fagin. Kelerchian let Terra scan his mind and she learned that if she went with Kelerchian she would become a ghost. She also learned that a memory wipe was a standard part of the training regimen. This Terra saw as an incentive, as she did not want to remember the deaths and murders. A satisfactory end to the operation was interrupted by the penetration of the orbital defenses by the Sons of Korhal. Killiany transferred oversight of the operation from Kelerchian to Ndoci, who directed her troops to kill everybody except for Terra (no exception was made for Kelerchian). In the ensuing firefight Fagin's compound collapsed. Ralian was killed, while Terra and Kelerchian were trapped together, and Ndoci was trapped elsewhere in the building. Terra used her powers to rescue herself and Kelerchian, but the latter was severely wounded. Terra forced Ndoci to summon medical aid for Kelerchian by threatening to reveal her dangerous tactics (nearly killing an alpha priority target) to Ilsa Killiany. Then the zerg attacked, but Terra, Kelerchian, and Ndoci survived.Ghost Training  Nova Terra was taken the Ghost Academy based on Ursa. Despite her considerable psychic power she started at a disadvantage due to the ill-effects of months of abuse and malnutrition and she barely handled Sergeant Hartley's physical training regime. She was the focus of resentment, jealousy and sexual desire from many of her fellow trainees. Six months into training Terra met Kelerchian again, and discovered (through mind reading) that the wrangler was being sent on a one way mission to Sakrysta Mining Base by Emperor Arcturus Mengsk. They said their farewells and parted ways.Team Blue  As her training progressed, Nova Terra became part of Team Blue as part of the Academy's curriculum of team-based training. This presented a challenge for Terra as her experiences in the Gutter had taught her self-reliance \u2013 a strength that became a weakness in the squad. One of her first training missions was the Valerian hostage rescue scenario. While Gabriel Tosh directed fellow teammates Kath Toom and Lio Travski, Terra ran off and tried to complete the mission by herself. Her teammates messed up and \"died\", enabling Terra to almost succeed. \"Sparky\" and Preceptor Lagdamen both rated her highly, something which Terra herself disagreed with. As Terra headed to her next class, she thought she saw a child, whom she would notice several times during her stay. Terra was rudely confronted by Dylanna Okyl, the leader of Team Red. While Okyl hadn't scored as highly, she hadn't let her whole team \"die\". Terra ignored her. Tosh privately tried to convince Terra to display teamwork, but she brushed off his advice. Toom was left upset by the encounter. Terra displayed high competence but a lack of teamwork in other training scenarios. After several encounters with Okyl, in which Terra blamed her team for their poor performance, Tosh shouted at her that if she had worked with them, their poor performance wouldn't have mattered. The lesson finally sunk in. Terra cooperated with Kath Toom on an assignment and later, upon meeting new trainee Delta Emblock, whose background had left her without schooling (which Terra learned by accidentally scanning her), Terra helped her with her literacy test. Toom was so surprised by this new attitude she asked what happened to the old Nova Terra. While celebrating Emblock's successful literacy test, Toom and Tosh discussed similarities between their backgrounds and Terra's. However, Tosh's comments hit too close to home, prompting Terra to run off. She suffered nightmares that night, which Tosh felt because he didn't sleep with a psi-screen on. Terra participated in another Valerian scenario. This time she worked with her team, including new teammate Aal Cistler. However, as the scenario finished, Lio Travski suffered a bad reaction from drug abuse. Terra, recognizing the symptoms from her days in the Gutter, called for medical assistance. This brought her to the attention of Superintendent Sarco Angelini, who had been secretly testing the effects of drug abuse on Travski's psychic abilities. He memory wiped Terra and Travski so they would forget that experience. Terra now found herself uncomfortable with the prospect of memory wiping, as she would forget friends like Kath Toom. Angelini watched this conversation through the surveillance system. Meanwhile, Terra was promoted to third-class due to her new positive attitude and high scores. However, Terra's attitude toward the Ghost Program had worsened. She thought they were sloppy about numerous things, such as their psi-screens.Mind Games  Terra's abilities made her Team Blue's \"ace in the hole,\" at least in Tosh's mind. However, despite the teamwork, Team Blue began to fall apart, the reasons including Tosh's admiration for her turning into distracting attraction. This was one of the reasons Dylanna Okyl was so aggravated by Terra; Okyl had a crush on Tosh. During a training scenario against zerg-bots, Terra detected a \"controlling consciousness\" behind them\u2014Sarco Angelini\u2014and psychically attacked him. Angelini quickly ended the scenario, but was very impressed. He wished the other ghosts were as powerful as her. As Okyl ranted about their performance, Terra read her mind, learning about her attraction to Tosh. Okyl was humiliated. Aal Cistler used his father's influence to return to the Academy, and immediately joined Okyl's Team Red. At martial arts training, a bitter Okyl challenged Terra to a \"duel\", but Tosh stood up for her. Okyl beat him up. Afterward Tosh and Terra kissed while out of the view of security cameras, even though Academy policies forbade dating between students. When Delta Emblock asked her about it, she said she just wanted some happiness now, and they technically weren't dating anyway. Tosh feared what could happen to them if Okyl found out and reported them. For this reason he rejected Nova's further advances to protect her. An emotionally stunned Terra then ran into Okyl and Cistler; the latter promised to ruin her. Terra then stumbled across the \"spirit\" of Colin Phash, who was using his astral projection ability to ask for help. He lured her to a restricted area. Terra warned her other team members about Cistler's plans while meeting up with a newly-confident Lio Travski. Teams Blue and Red were taking part in a \"live fire\" (but non-lethal) exercise. Okyl arranged for her entire team to focus on Terra, believing her to be the only threat on Team Blue. She wanted to be the one to beat up Terra. Team Blue, except for Terra and Travski, were taken out. Okyl and Cistler skirted a group of abandoned SCVs in order to reach Terra, but Travski used his technopathic abilities to activate them and capture the entirety of Team Red. The exercise was terminated, and both teams informed they would join into a new team and take part in a training mission away from the Academy, on the fifth planet of The Baker's Dozen.The Battle of Shi  Team Purple, overseen by Preceptor Lagdamen, was transported to the star system on the battlecruiser Cyrus, commanded by Commodore Georg Darabont. During the trip, Nova learned from a crew member that the ship was significantly underpowered as the crew were trying to not think about the ship's history. Other trainees also learned that the crew were regarded as \"cowards\" for retreating at the Battle of Tarsonis. At The Baker's Dozen star system, the ship diverted to the fourth planet when Lio Travski picked up a distress signal via his technopathic abilities. Darabont was swayed due to the chance to fight the zerg and prove he wasn't a coward, but Lagdamen opposed going into combat on the \"wrong\" planet. Upon the realization that it was being sent from a mining post by the Kusinis Twins\u2014friends from Nova's life as a child of the Old Families, Nova demanded that she personally take part in their rescue. The marines landed on Shi but were inundated by waves of zerg from a hatchery cluster south of Mandible Canyon. Darabont ordered the use of Apocalypse-class nuclear missiles. These would be fired by Dylanna Okyl and Aal Cistler and guided by Nova. The mission was a success, allowing a landing zone to be established. Afterward, through her telepathy, Nova discovered that more Old Family scions, Morgan Calabas and Antonia Tygore, were also alive on the world. As Team Purple and the marines cleared out the remaining zerg from the area, Nova came across the Kusinis Twins while the rest of the troops found Calabas and Tygore. Nova and the Kusinis Twins linked up with the other troops. However, more zerg arrived in force from previously undetected hatcheries on the far side of Mandible Canyon, destroying the transports. The cloaked ghosts were discovered by overlords, forcing a hard fight. The Cyrus was itself shot down by spore cannons. The zerg invaded, killing both Darabont and Mirne. Gabriel Tosh took the opportunity to rekindle his relationship with Nova. He said he had broken up with her to protect her, but realized this had only hurt her. Nova was receptive to his advance. Morgan Calabas, who had carried a keepsake of Nova, apologized for his previous behavior. Nova forgave him. Meanwhile Travski used his powers to track the Cyrus. It was damaged but still \"alive\", and he believed he could use his abilities to repair it. However, making it there and keeping it safe would require time and protection. Nova Terra's psionic abilities, which could inflict massive damage in a four-block radius, would be useful here. Aal Cistler suggested she lure the zerg, but Lagdamen and Tosh disapproved of the plan. Terra decided to go through with it. She would attack the hatchery cluster. Tosh decided to go with her. The terrans headed to the Cyrus while they were cloaked by Travski. He then used his powers to begin repairing the ship. Toom used her shooting skills to take out overlords. As Tosh and Terra headed out, Lagdamen gave the cloaking device controls to Tosh. Along the way they encountered walking spore crawlers, which they had to avoid. The Cyrus fell under attack, but eventually the zerg retreated as Nova Terra was \"powering up\" her psychic abilities there. Tosh had to flee the area as Terra was charging up. He ran out of energy for his cloaking device and had to fight zerg. As he struggled to get clear, Terra was also under attack. When she alerted him to this fact, he told her he was clear but he hadn't actually made it out of the blast radius. Terra unleashed her power, frying the zerg and hatcheries. She found a crippled, barely alive Tosh. A distraught Nova kept Tosh alive through psychic healing. The Cyrus, now repaired, picked up the two ghosts. Tosh's brain was scanned. The Cyrus was able to leave Shi now that the zerg had been reduced in number or eliminated. For all of Team Purple's efforts however, they weren't to remember it, as per Arcturus Mengsk's orders. Within a few days of the battle, the entire team bar Tosh had been memory wiped, Nova included. In the same period, UNN announced that the Old Family children the ghosts and marines had rescued had been killed by the zerg nearly a year ago during the Great War. Nova, remembering her Old Family friends but not the part she'd played in her rescue, went to visit Tosh. He tried to tell her about what really happened, but Nova was entrenched in the cover story of the \"accident\" that had injured Tosh and the \"delusions\" he was having as a result. With each ghost entrenched in his/her own truth, the two failed to reconcile. Tosh said everything would be like before, as if nothing ever happened.War Pigs  Later, in 2502, Nova was assigned to shadow the War Pigs\u2014a group of outlaws gone rogue from the Dominion.Graduation  Nova pulled through and completed her ghost training in a record two and a half years, whereas it normally took four years. Nearing the end of her training Nova Terra was met by Emperor Arcturus Mengsk himself, who gave her a final training assignment: kill Cliff Nadaner, a former anti-Confederate terrorist turned anti-Dominion terrorist. Nadaner had led the group that sent Edward Peters, Gustavo McBain and others to kill her family. Terra was to go to Tyrador VIII alone and kill Nadaner with only her mental powers. She was inserted via drop pod with only some of a ghost's standard equipment. Terra successfully located her target, eliminating the defending troops. She verbally confronted Nadaner for ruining her life and killed him last. Upon completion of her training, Nova was designated Agent X41822N and received a memory wipe, becoming yet another ghost single-mindedly focused on serving the Dominion and destroying the Dominion's enemies.Ghosts of the Past New Sydney  During a mission against the Koprulu Liberation Front on New Sydney Nova would again meet the Annihilators. Esmerelda Ndoci recognized Nova but due to the memory wipe Nova no longer recognized Ndoci, nor did she particularly care.Other Missions  Terra would encounter Ndoci at least one more time. During this mission, Ndoci died during transport in a zerg firefight. Captain Spaulding would blame Terra for this death. Terra conducted a number of assassination missions (including one in an Agrian slum) and even encountered the protoss on the world of Braken. Her operations sent her to hunt down AWOL members of the Dominion Marine Corps, traitors to Arcturus Mengsk, and leaders in spies leftover from the UED Expeditionary Fleet. She participated in Operation: Rabid Dog and Operation: Toolbox during this time.Altara  Sometime after New Sydney, Nova was attached to Nova Squadron as part of a mission to Altara to investigate the disappearance of a fellow ghost and a wrangler sent to locate her. She was granted her own quarters on the battlecruiser Palatine. Arriving at the world, it was discovered that a zerg force was en route to the planet as well. Through her telepathic abilities, Nova could sense that the zerg were here for a specific reason, and that their presence was not a coincidence. She informed Colonel Jackson Hauler of this development. Aware that the marines of the Palatine had little experience against the zerg, she requested that she be sent in solo, in order to do reconnaissance and to give the marines time to prepare, to provide support if necessary. Hauler agreed to her request. Nova made her way across the surface, keeping in contact with Hauler as she did so. She made it to the site of the wrangler's ship, but against her advice, Hauler began deploying ground forces, stirring up the zerg. To make matters worse, the marines had little experience against the zerg and their CO, Lieutenant Chet Ward, was oblivious to the effects this lack of experience could have on the outcome of the battle. He ignored Nova's advice for the most part and the marines he sent to scout the zerg position were quickly overwhelmed by roaches and zerglings. The bulk of the ground forces were hard pressed by the xenomorphs, but Nova was practically unstoppable, her psionic powers and C-20A rifle felling numerous zerg. She turned the tide by acting as bait for the zerg, drawing them into a crossfire. Nova emerged unscathed and the zerg were mowed down in a hail of gunfire. Ward grudgingly thanked her, but Nova brushed him off, ordering him and his men to set up a defensive perimeter while she headed off to find the wrangler. The wrangler turned out ot be Kelerchian, though while he recognised her, a history of mind wipes prevented Nova from doing the same. She used her telekinetic abilities to get him to safety, though this was a task not made easy by the zerg closing in on her position. During the fighting, a hydralisk damaged the filters of her face mask, which left her exposed to the terrazine gas present. Nova kept fighting, providing a distraction to let the Grizzlies carry the marines to safety, but the terrazine started to rejuvinate her memory, granting her flashbacks of her time with Fagin, her mission to Shi and the death of her family. Nova finished off the zerg with a mind blast, then passed out.Whispers and Memories  Nova awoke in the medical bay of the Palatine, and was greeted by Captain Rourke and Doctor Shaw. The CO explained that her mind blast had eradicated the zerg forces present, saving the Nova Squadron ones. Nova however, still had problems, namely hallucinations and flashbacks\u2014the consequences of her terrazine exposure. Shaw brushed her concerns aside, though was also hiding something from her, aside from his obvious contempt for the ghost, as sensed by her telepathy. Regardless, Rourke took Nova to see Kelerchian and while she didn't immediately recognise him, the flashbacks filled in some of the blanks, how Kelerchian had been the one to recruit her into the Ghost Program. He went on to provide an account of his mission to Altara until the pair were summoned to the bridge for a report on the effects of terrazine and how it had lured the zerg in. During this period, Emperor Arcturus Mengsk contacted the vessel, ordering that he be allowed to converse with Nova and Kelerchian privately. Although aggravated, Hauler agreed and granted the pair the comm. room in privacy. Nova could sense unease from both Mengsk and Kelerchian. There was good reason for it, as Mengsk revealed that there'd never been any report of a UED cell on Altara, nor had he given the order to send a ghost in to investigate. Mengsk elaborated on the shadow war the Dominion had been waging over the last few months and wanted the perpetrators stopped before the truth was revealed. The pair were ordered to find the missing ghosts and shut down those responsible for the abductions. The pair's first order of business was to make inquiries in the Altaran town of Oasis. While few of the townsfolk had any useful information, they heard from a smuggler that an Umojan spy had appeared in the town several weeks ago. Kelerchian was feeling the psionic effect of fellow ghosts assigned to help them and Nova began to feel something too, its psionic nature standing out from the rest of the town. It was a spectre, one that supposedly got the best of fellow ghost, Agent X72341R. It was also at this point that she encountered a young telepath named Lila, who had had a brush-in with the spectre as well. Nova learnt of her past through telepathy and developed an attatchment to her, given that her circumstances were akin to her own ordeal in the Gutter (so remembered due to her terrazine exposure). Nova offered to take her back to Korhal, but was slightly uneasey at the prospect, knowing that Lila would likely be conscripted into the Ghost Program. Nova and Kelerchian returned to the Palatine where they met the assembled ghosts assigned to them and, as per their real names being classified, assigned nicknames\u2014 \"Bones\" (from the surface), \"Lethal\", \"Rook\", \"the Veteran\", \"Rip\" and \"Guns.\" Along with Rourke and Hauler, they discussed the information that had been gathered on the surface. Despite Rourke's suggestions to the contrary, Nova maintained that the disapearences were related, and that the UED wasn't responsible. Kelerchian voiced his theory that the insurgents were using a mobile base of operations, but either way, the meeting was called to a close as the Annihilators arrived alongside the Palatine, demanding permission to board. It was granted and Nova once again found herself in the presence of Annihilator members, namely Major Spaulding and Captain Vincent. It was a presence that she didn't enjoy\u2014thanks to her terrazine exposure, she vaguely recalled the unit rescuing her from Fagin, their heavy-handed M.O. not exactly endearing them to her. Hauler reinforced the fact that Nova and Kelerchian were in charge, but as Nova began experiencing hallucinations of Fagin and Markus Ralian, it wasn't a position she was in perfect condition to take on. A concerned Kelerchian made her take a return trip to visit Dr. Shaw. Shaw however, had little to offer bar psychiatric platitudes and barely concealed thoughts of fear and loathing. However, he did offer the information that the gas she'd been exposed to was repairing her brain tissue, reversing the effects of her memory wipes. Shaw was clearly hiding something, but it became moot as Kelerchian received an encrypted message, warning them that Augustgrad had come under attack.Augustgrad  Emperor Arcturus Mengsk managed to hide in his panic room and get a message off. Colonel Hauler dispatched Terra and her ghost team, and would send Lt. Chet Ward and then other forces afterward. The ghosts were dropped off at the outskirts of Augustgrad and took vultures to the palace. On the way, Terra noticed that \"Bones\" could sense her presence even when she was cloaked. She realized that \"Bones\" was the spectre who had attacked her on Altara. Bones was standing by a fountain, and Terra, using her terrazine-enhanced senses, could locate him well enough to telekinetically throw water on him, revealing him more fully. She used a psychic attack to \"cook\" his brain, killing him. That's when the spectre team led by Gabriel Tosh arrived. Four spectres launched mental attacks which disabled the ghosts' suits. All the ghosts but Terra were immobilized as well. Terra broke the spectres' grip and started killing them. The spectres fled, but the other members of Terra's team were all killed or taken away by the spectres. Tosh mentally introduced himself to Terra. She wasn't interested and telekinetically threw a statue at him. Terra escaped and entered Mengsk's palace, but another spectre, Dylanna Okyl, was waiting there. Okyl ambushed Terra, cutting her back with a knife and spraying her with terrazine. Okyl mocked her with the words \"breathe deep\" before leaving. Terra woke up with Okyl and Tosh standing there. Tosh tried to recruit her, claiming that with her help they could get to Mengsk. However, marines entered the palace, prompting the spectres to flee. Terra waited outside Mengsk's panic room, guarding it. A medic treated Terra's wound. Emperor Mengsk met with Terra and Malcolm Kelerchian, and threw everyone else out. He was impressed with Terra's loyalty. The Annihilators leaders boarded the Palatine. They insulted Terra, who snapped back mentally. Spaulding demanded a meeting. They were angered because they had wanted to immediately descend and attack, but Hauler had refused due to the communication breakdown. Spaulding had gone to a meeting with Mengsk in order to gain control of the operation, but Mengsk preferred to leave control with Hauler. Spaulding then accused Terra of being a spectre. He accused her and Kelerchian of hiding evidence and manipulating the situation, such as blowing up the Altara refinery. Ward gave an edited account of Terra's threats against him, making it nearly impossible to refute. Dr. Shaw also gave evidence against her. Hauler was angered at his subordinates Shaw and Ward, as they hadn't spoken to him first. He had Spaulding thrown off his ship. Afterward, Terra asked him for information about Project Shadowblade and the Battle of Shi. Terra and Kelerchian discussed their next moves. Terra had also come to realize that Kelerchian was in love with her, the reason he had named his ship the November. During their conversation, knockout gas entered the room, knocking them out.Gehenna  Hauler and Terra talked. Terra realized that Hauler was also General Bennett, but couldn't attack him as he had dosed her with anti-psi neuroleptics and also removed her ghost suit. He told her about the background of Project Shadowblade. He also confirmed the deaths of the Old Family children after the Battle of Shi. He showed Terra a holo of Malcolm Kelerchian, being held prisoner on Gehenna Station. Unless Terra agreed to work with him, Hauler would have Kelerchian killed. She agreed, temporarily, to fool Hauler's mind-reading abilities. The Palatine would return to Korhal, where Terra would capture Mengsk and force him to deliver a confession which would eventually result in Hauler being put into power. Terra was handed to Dr. Shaw. However, Dr. Shaw intended to slowly kill her, as when she was a child, her powers had killed his parents. Shaw drugged her, but Lio Travski was able to reach her through the electrodes. Terra was able to escape, killing Shaw and slipping away. Terra remained aboard the Palatine. The November was launched, while Travski shut down the battlecruiser's tracking and comm systems shut down. Benett was fooled. Meanwhile Terra contacted Major Spaulding of the Annihilators and, after convincing him of Bennett's guilt rather than her own, planned an attack on Gehenna Station according to a strict schedule. The Palatine came to Gehenna. Travski announced that he had found the November with one life sign, and had shut down its comm system. Bennett checked the ship but couldn't find Terra there. Travski warned Terra that her deception had been detected. Terra slipped into Gehenna. She ran into a crying Kath Toom. Terra told her what had happened. Toom was still in love with Tosh, however, and the two fought. Terra used her telekinesis to knock Toom unconscious. She then stole Toom's needler gun and spectre suit. Terra slipped into Kelerchian's cell and freed him. Travski told them of the plot to frame her. Travski manipulated the lights, enabling Terra to escape. Outside she fought Lt. Ward, several marines, and two spectres. Terra and Kelerchian eventually won the battle. Lt. Ward admitted to the murder in Hudderstown before Terra killed him. She also learned a little about Bennett's tactics from him. The station came under fire. Captain Rourke reported that Gehenna's weapons were down. Bennett believed Travski was behind this and ordered Rourke to set off the EMP. Rourke did so. Major Spaulding contacted them; it was his battlecruiser which had begun the assault. Terra had asked Travski to contact Spaulding, and while he was angry, she furnished him with enough proof of Bennett's treachery to convince him. Terra tried to reach the Palatine, but Hauler intercepted her. He used psionics to daze Kelerchian and tried to use his telepathic powers to charm Terra, but she eventually snapped out of it, remembering he was General Bennett. He cloaked and escaped. Terra noticed Lila aboard the station, and frantically pursued her, but it turned out to be an illusion created by Bennett. Separated from Kelerchian, she was vulnerable to Bennett's pyrokinesis attack. Terra fended the attack off, but Bennett was able to cut her mask and force her to decloak. He then began shooting at her, forcing Terra to throw blast doors at him in order to escape. Terra found herself among rows of \"stasis chambers\", many of which were occupied. Bennett told her these were psi indoctrinators, used to modify the brains of people with even the slightest psionic talent to become powerful weapons. Resocialized terrans were being made psychic, and became teeps close to but not at the level of ghosts. Bennett could even control the victims from anywhere. Bennett threatened to release them, but Terra called his bluff. He blew up some of the equipment in order to escape. Kelerchian arrived at the scene, and General Bennett ambushed and grabbed him. He told Terra to get into an indoctrinator tank, or he would attack her like he had Toom. Terra got in. While there, Travski contacted her. He had survived the EMP attack. She told him to feed footage of Bennett's admission of murder to Tosh. An angry Tosh barged in. As he and Bennett used their psionic powers against each other, Terra was able to use her own powers to throw a stalactite at Bennett, killing him. Terra and Kelerchian fled before Spaulding would begin firing nuclear at the station. Tosh stopped them, though, and told them that Toom and Travski were aboard the Palatine, and they could go with him. Terra said that Kelerchian needed treatment, and she would take them into the infirmary. Instead, they escaped on the November. Travski sent her a message, saying he would go into the datastream. She decided to stop off at Altara and give Lila a good home.Aftermath  Nova ended up capturing numerous spectres. They were imprisoned in New Folsom Prison.Second Great War Wings of Liberty  During the Second Great War, Nova moved to assassinate spectre Gabriel Tosh and stop his spectre program. This operation was not approved by Dominion command, and was listed as an unauthorized solo operation. Tosh was working with Raynor's Raiders and had so far neglected to inform the rebels of his true nature or intentions. Nova attempted to dissuade further cooperation by sending an anonymous message to the Raiders exposing Tosh as a spectre. Raynor was prepared to continue working with Tosh, especially as they both had anti-Dominion goals. Nova learned of the operation to raid New Folsom Prison and decided to contact Raynor directly in an attempt to forestall the operation. She revealed the prison held captured spectres, which Tosh wanted to reactivate with the jorium and terrazine the Raiders had procured for him. Furthermore, she claimed all spectres became psychopathic killers, and that Tosh would inevitably crack and betray Raynor. The ghost exaggerated the risk posed by spectres. Finally she warned a jailbreak would inevitably release prisoners better left imprisoned. Raynor was disappointed by Tosh's secrecy, but was willing to continue working with the anti-Dominion spectre, rather than with a Dominion agent. The prison guards were forewarned of the impending raid by Nova, but were ultimately unable to prevent the breakout. Raynor was convinced by Nova's argument. The ghost and Raynor's Raiders destroyed the spectre's training facility. Tosh himself was killed by Nova while arguing remotely with Raynor. She told Raynor that she'd be seeing him again. For their assistance, Nova gave the Raiders the material needed to train ghosts. She sometimes appeared in the armory afterward, randomly cloaking and uncloaking. The ghost gave the Raiders Tosh's knife and voodoo doll as trophies.Heart of the Swarm  Nova led the raid on Research Station EB-103. When Bravo Team failed to report in, she ordered all units to sector six. Once her forces had taken control of the security hub, she called upon Sarah Kerrigan to surrender. Though Kerrigan escaped, Nova managed to capture Raynor. At some point, Nova took part in combat against the zerg.End War  Alongside fellow commanders, Nova commanded terran forces during the End War.The Keep  Sometime after the End War, Nova participated in an operation to retrieve a prototype terran phase disruptor. Her mission was successful, and she subsequently underwent a voluntary memory wipe to forget the mission details. Afterwards, she was personally contacted by Emperor Valerian Mengsk, who discussed with her that his connections to the Moebius Foundation were never made public. However, the Umojan Protectorate had managed to find files linking him to the organization, and he feared they planned to use them against him. He tasked Nova with entering their neigh-impenetrable space fortress the Keep and retrieving the disks. Nova commandeered the freighter Charon, and made it look as it if it was offline. She then injected herself with a toxin that would fake her death, and set the freighter on a course for the Keep. Her ship was picked up by security, and she was brought in for an autopsy. As she was brought in, the toxin worse off, and Nova used her psionic powers to give the doctor preparing to operate on her a nosebleed and a headache. The doctor left the room, giving Nova time to get into her hostile environment suit. Nova cloaked, and moved through the keep trying to get back to the Charon. However, on the way a shadowguard psionically sensed her, and contacted her, saying she had been behind the attacks on Zanadar Prime that destroyed a tenement house full of innocent people. Nova reflected that she did not remember this due to her mind wipes, but figured that it could also be psychological warfare. Nova lured the shadowguard down a hallway, and dropped from the ceiling on him. After a brief physical confrontation, Nova shot him in the neck. This however alerted security, and experimental black widow drones were deployed to Nova. Nova ran down a hallway, and noted life support lines in the station filled with liquid oxygen. She shot one of the lines, freezing the black widow swarm. She then ran back to the Charon, and grabbed the gear she needed for the operation. Nova set up a bomb in one of the maintenance shafts, in plain view of the Umojan security. The Umojans began to evacuate to the nearby sentinel watchtowers, but unbeknownst to them the explosives were fake, and real ones were aboard the evacuation ships. The explosives destroyed the four watchtowers. Noting five minutes until Umojan reinforcements arrived, Nova moved to the vault and set up a phase disruptor to pierce the meter thick wall. However, she was ambushed by the same shadowguard from earlier. Nova overcame him, and threw him into the line of the phase disruptor's fire, vaporizing both of them and opening the way for the vault. With the way clear, Nova took the disks and fled aboard the ship carrying the Charon before reinforcements arrived. Nova gave the disks to Valerian, who reflected that he regretted his connection to Moebius, and he had turned a blind eye to their creation of the hybrid. Nova told Valerian that memories and secrets could not simply be buried, that they would always be there to haunt him. Valerian reflected on this, and asked her to leave. Later, Nova prepared to be mind wiped of the mission, when she heard on UNN that Valerian had made the documents public, and announced his connections to Moebius. Nova then turned around, deciding against the mind wipe.Covert Ops Lost Memories  Several years later after the End War, Nova came to be involved in the activities of the Defenders of Man, a terran separatist group. Nova, along with Stone, was assigned to work with the Defenders of Man by the Dominion. During her operation, she set out to plant anti-zerg devices on Antiga Prime. However, she and Stone soon discovered the devices were psi-emitters. Nova and Stone attempted to retrieve their mission files and tell the Dominion of what the Defenders had done, but she was soon captured by her wrangler, Maxwell. Maxwell deferred to the Defenders of Man Leader, General Carolina Davis, who ordered her mind wiped. However before she did, Nova planted a message in her visor stating \"YOU ARE IN DANGER. THEY WILL KILL YOU.\" Nova, under the command of the Defenders of Man, was later trailed by Michael Liberty. Liberty left tips to Radio Liberty listeners leading them to a secure Defender of Man database, where they discovered her profile and footage showing Nova having assassinated undercover Dominion agents in the base. This caused a stir as this footage leaked to Dominion public, leading Kate Lockwell to ask if Dominion soldiers had gone rogue. Later, Nova found herself in a Defenders of Man facility, unaware of where she was. A servo, through which Maxwell's voice spoke, ordered her to put on her visor for software calibration. Doing so, a message appeared within the HUD, telling her that she was in danger, and that she had to escape. She cloaked, despite the voice's protests. She then attacked the camera, and confronted Maxwell, who was running the diagnostic, demanding to know where she was. Maxwell refused, and she killed him. Nova escaped the facility and contacted Stone, who had also escaped. The two fought their way through the facility, reclaiming her C-20A rifle and pulse grenades and came in contact with Delta Emblock and Theodore Pierce, who had been assigned to Nova's team. Nova's team escaped from the facility on vultures, with Nova and Stone splitting up on their own through the Sharpsburg freeway. They fought through Defender of Man vultures, hellions, banshees, and a Warhawk to reach the spaceport. The two reached the port, with Stone demanding to stay behind for the next ship. Nova left on her own, and was escorted by a Dominion battlecruiser to Borea. At the Dominion base there, she was confronted by Admiral Matt Horner, who informed her she had been missing in action for months and had been wanted for treason against the Dominion. However, just then feral zerg invaded Borea and attacked their base. Horner said he believed her when she said she had no memory of the past few months, and asked her to help defend their base. Nova took her forces to the hills, and defended the Dominion base, using the canyons to her advantage. The zerg attack was slowed, but just then a Defenders of Man fleet arrived and attacked the zerg, informing the population of the planet that the Dominion had failed them and the Defenders of Man would protect them. The Defenders of Man then contacted Horner, demanding he surrender Nova. In the chaos of their attack, Nova and the Dominion escaped the planet. Nova met with Emperor Valerian Mengsk, who offered her a Covert Ops Crew and a new ship, the Griffin in return for her loyalty. She accepted, and Valerian introduced her to her new weapons and technology specialist, Reigel. Reigel informed her he could try to make her removed memories resurface by stimulating her neural inhibitor. This was attempted, and she remembered going to Tarsonis City after its fall to the zerg. Nova and her crew moved in to find the Defenders of Man base she suspected was there. Her forces secured garrisons surrounding the base while she infiltrated in. The Defenders of Man discovered her presence, and activated a psi emitter in the base. Nova continued on in spite of the zerg attack, and discovered the command room. Killing the technician manning it, Nova discovered that the Defenders of Man were planting psi emitters to attract feral zerg to planets, and they intended to send the zerg to Tyrador IX to show how weak Valerian's regime was. Nova swore she would put a stop to their operation.Plots and Manipulations  Nova and her Covert Ops Crew quickly moved to Tyrador IX, but found it overrun by the zerg. Reigel noted that they could not engage the zerg directly, and that there were high casualties. The Defenders of Man fleet arrived, saying they would help shelter any civilians who needed evacuation. Nova decided that she would engage the zerg first, then deal with the Defenders of Man. Nova arrived on the surface with a group of banshees while Reigel set up her base. Nova and her banshees began engaging zerg hatcheries in the area, but Reigel noticed warp signatures, and thought they were zerg reinforcements. They were not; these forces were the Tal'darim Death Fleet under First Ascendant Ji'nara. The Death Fleet fired on the zerg, then brought down their Tal'darim mothership. Ji'nara contacted Nova's forces, saying they were after the Defenders of Man, and telling the Dominion to stay away from their forces. Nova noted that though the Tal'darim would deal with the Defenders, they would likely kill the civilians they were defending in the process. Nova decided that could not happen, and attacked the four shield projectors defending their mothership. Enraged, Ji'nara sent the mothership after Nova's forces, but without the shield projectors Nova's forces were able to destroy it. With the Tal'darim defeated, the Defenders of Man were able to rally and push the zerg off of Tyrador IX. However, they also took credit for the victory, a fact Nova bemoaned. Nova returned to the Griffin, but noticed a strange psionic signature coming from the bridge. She leveled her gun to find the Tal'darim Highlord Alarak waiting for her. Reigel stopped her before she could fire, saying he was a guest. Alarak explained the Defenders of Man attacked a remote Tal'darim outpost and fled, and he desired vengeance. He noticed she once worked with the Defenders of Man, and offered her a bargain, Alarak would lead Nova to terrazine to unlock her memories, and in return she would lead Alarak to the Defenders of Man. Nova agreed, and Alarak took her to Jarban Minor. There Nova found extraction devices set up by the Umojan Protectorate to extract terrazine from the Jarban gliders in the area. However, they were surrounded by the infested remains of the Umojan team. To make matters harder, Alarak allowed Ji'nara to challenge Nova, and she deployed her forces to destroy the extraction devices. Nova rescued the surviving members of the Umojan expedition, and Reigel noted that there were potential technologies in a nearby cave and science facility. Nova was successful in extracting the terrazine before the devices were destroyed by the infested and the Tal'darim. Alarak met Nova, and said that provided the terrazine didn't kill her it would undo her memory wipe. Nova asked she would contact Alarak when she found the Defenders, and Alarak simply said he'd know. With that, the two factions parted ways. Nova contacted Valerian, who was dealing with protests outside of Korhal Palace. He was trepid about Nova using terrazine, and told her to be careful. Reigel noted that he could prevent the side effects of terrazine if he administered it to her in microdoses, and she agreed. Upon taking one does, she remembered a briefing by the wrangler Maxwell sending her to Antiga Prime. Nova took the Griffin there, and remembered being in the city of New Andasar. Nova and her forces landed in the city and engaged the feral zerg, and Reigel noted that if the feral zerg structures were destroyed it would limit what forces they'd send against Nova. Nova moved through the city, gradually administering terrazine and remembering aspects of her operation, including working with Stone and uncovering the psi-emitters. Nova then remembered that Stone had not wiped the mission files from their operations center, and fought through the feral zerg to reach them. Upon taking them, she took one last dose of terrazine, and remembered that General Carolina Davis was the leader of the Defenders of Man who ordered her mind wiped. Enraged, Nova reported this to Valerian, and insisted the Davis had to be killed for using her. Valerian stated that he had a plan, and that Nova needed to play her part in it. Nova reluctantly agreed. Valerian later contacted Davis, saying he was stepping down as Emperor of the Dominion.Broken Alliances  Valerian made public his plans to announce his stepping down on the planet of Vardona, and he ordered Nova to aid him in a plot to expose Davis. Valerian would make his speech, and the Defenders would be focused on him and his military convoy. Meanwhile, Nova would infiltrate Davis's compound and apprehend Davis, bringing her before Valerian, where he'd announce her arrest. Nova infiltrated through the sewers, and Reigel noted a power source coming from a lab nearby. Nova slipped past the light defenses guarding the sewers, and made it into Davis's compound. There she unlocked the two doors leading into Davis's main chamber. However, inside the facility she found Delta and Pierce locked in holding pens, with Delta having no memory of Nova. Nova was concerned, but Reigel assured her that a rescue team would be on their way for them. As Nova entered Davis's chambers she found Stone, who had his memories altered to insist she abandoned the Defenders and betrayed them. Nova incapacitated him, but did not kill him, and told Reigel to send a force to retrieve her old comrade. Nova pushed into Davis's office, and apprehended her. Nova then dragged Davis out in handcuffs before the people of Vardona, where Valerian announced that he was arresting her for crimes against the Dominion. However, just as she was brought out, Alarak arrived with the Death Fleet and began assaulting the city. He psionically informed her that this was their bargain, but Nova stated he'd refuse to let him harm the city's civilians. Nova, Valerian and Horner prepared a defense of the city. Nova and her Covert Ops Crew were aided by lower ranking members of the Defenders of Man who were unaware of Davis's true agenda. Reigel noted that the science center in the middle of the city was close to a breakthrough and should be defended. Nova and her forces supported the terran lines against the Tal'darim, whethering the brunt of their attacks and grinding their forces down. Admiral Horner called in the Dominion Fleet, which supported the ground forces with Gorgon-class battlecruisers. Ji'nara attempted to exact revenge on Nova through her motherships, but she was unable to defeat the terran defenders. Evewntually, the lines proved too much for the Tal'darim, who suffered defeat after massive casualties. In the chaos however, General Davis took the Medusa and fled the planet. Nova got into the Griffin and gave chase. As Nova left the planet, she was contacted by Alarak, who told her she had just made a powerful enemy. Nova told him likewise, and told him to never come back, before shutting off communications. She then contacted Valerian, who was infuriated with Davis's tactics, which were similar to her fathers, and told her to bring Davis in alive. Nova strongly objected, as they had tried that and failed, but Valerian stated that was her orders. Nova begrudgingly agreed, and stormed off. After hours of losing the Medusa, Reigel found a lead as the top secret Cerros Shipyards were under attack by a lone ship. With her target in sight, Nova gave chase. Nova arrived to find that Davis and her loyalist Defenders had taken part of the shipyard and activated the Xanthos, an experimental war machine. They intended to destroy the Gorgon-class battlecruisers stationed there, crippling the Dominion Fleet and preventing Emperor Valerian from ruling effectively. Nova and forces under Admiral Horner came to the defense of the station. Though the Xanthos could not be damaged by small arms while activated, its weapons could be destroyed, which would leave it exposed and in need of repair. Nova defended the battlecruisers, while Horner took the Hyperion to push through the Defender's lines. Eventually, Nova and her allies were able to push to the Xanthos, but it activated a mode secret even to Reigel. This and the deployment of Davis's remaining forces were still not enough, and the Xanthos was destroyed. Davis was still alive inside, however, and Nova went in to pursue. Inside, Davis told her she knew the Terra family, and that they all used to be on the same side. She also stated that if Nova killed her, she'd be no better than her. Nova openly defied Valerian's direct order, and killed Davis. Later, aboard the Griffin, Nova began to stock up on what weapons she could when Reigel entered. Nova hid and prepared for a fight, when Reigel opened up to her about his history, about how his career was ruined by his connection to the Moebius Foundation. He also told her that he and the crew were loyal to her first and foremost. Nova stated that the Dominion would always have enemies, and that they would need to fight them their own way. Now branded fugitives of the Dominion, the two went to the bridge and sped off into an asteroid belt, abandoning the Dominion and becoming a vigilante division.Shadow Wars  After she became a vigilante, Nova and Reigel visited the mercenary outpost of Last Junction seeking out Elms and her crew, who had survived the Battle of Adena with a large amount of jorium in tow. Reigel found Elms and told her that he knew someone who would buy her jorium. Elms guided Reigel to her ship, and Nova uncloaked, saying she wished to buy their stockpile.Game Unit StarCraft II  Nova is available as a announcer with Patch 3.9. She was initially only purchasable in a bundle alongside the D.Va announcer, but became purchasable for those who purchased Nova Covert Ops.Heart of the Swarm  In Heart of the Swarm, Nova appears in-game in \"Back in the Saddle\", but only in a cutscene.Heroes of the Storm  Nova appears as a character in Heroes of the Storm.Personality and Traits Skills and Powers  Nova is the best ghost within the Terran Dominion. Indeed, her ghost profile labels her as \"the best of the best.\" She is skilled in all areas of operational performance.\" Nova has a good sense of balance. She underwent physical training at the Ghost Academy. She found it very difficult at first, not being accustomed to exercise and having still suffered from malnutrition and dehydration at the time, but eventually excelled at martial arts, the use of weapons, and driving a vulture. She was given permission to learn some skills earlier than usual, and undertook the four-year program in only two-and-a-half years; a record. Nova is a skilled hacker; she can take control of a nuclear silo in only a few minutes. Nova often instills lust and fear in males around her, her physical appearence driving the former emotion, and her telepathy instilling the latter one. At fifteen years of age, she was considered to be tall.Psionic Abilities  Nova has a Psi Index rating of 10 and as such, is one of the most powerful ghosts in existence. Her PI is only just surpassed by Sarah Kerrigan's rating as a ghost. She is so powerful that she finds it difficult not to read minds. She can even read minds through some types of psi-screens (such as those worn by the Annihilators) but was unable to read or attack the mind of Fagin while he wore one. Nova has the ability to telepathically communicate, at least with other psychics. Her abilities first manifested as \"empathy\" at age seven; her parents hid this from her. On her fifteenth birthday she found she could read one person's mind at close range. A few days later she discovered she could read her family's mind from a considerable distance away. Nova developed a powerful attack which can destroy the brains of up to a dozen opponents while leaving an individual in their midst unharmed. Nova's telekinetic abilities can slowly lift her (and others), is powerful enough to uproot shrubs, and she was able to briefly hold up part of a fallen building. She eventually learned to focus these abilities, and has frequently \"jammed\" firearms with it. She once used the ability to physically force someone to shoot another opponent. She could use her power to fire guns \"remotely\", open and damage metal doors and destroy combat robots. Her telekinetic abilities can improve her accuracy with firearms, her teeking guiding the bullets to an extent. Unlike other teeks, using telekinesis gives her a headache. The more effort she uses, the worse the pain. Nova's psionic training at the Ghost Academy progressed rapidly, and she found it much easier than the physical aspect. After her family died, Nova uncontrollably unleashed a massive telepathic and telekinetic blast which damaged the Terra Skyscraper and slew hundreds of people. Afterward Nova could reliably generate a mind blast with a four-block (or greater) radius, but at the cost of a prolonged charging time.Personality  Even through her ghost training (before the memory wipe) Nova's personality generally remained the same throughout her late teen years. She possessed a degree of empathy that was generally lacking in the Old Families (a trait that did not go unnoticed) and believed in the concept of fair play, or at least had an aversion to \"cheating\" (eg. considered attaching gliders to her shoes at her birthday to walk elegantly to be \"cheating\"). Although willing to deal death to those she believed to deserve it (e.g. Fagin and Cliff Nadaner), she wanted to avoid harming those who fell outside this definition (she did not want to harm Fagin's associates, regretted having to dispatch the rest of Nadaner's group, and wanted to spare Stone when Davis had altered his memories into thinking that she's a traitor). As of becoming a full fledged ghost, after undergoing a memory wipe, Nova's personality became colder. Due to much of her memory wipe being undone, Nova remains psychologically scarred by the murder of her family and has trouble connecting to people as a result. Not that she particularly desired to, however\u2014for the most part, she was content to be regarded as a merciless killer and remain isolated from her fellow soldiers, not wanting to forge attachments that could be broken. Kelerchian noted in their Altaran reunion however that she'd become more open from when he'd last seen her. Nova later noted that Kelerchian himself was \"the only man who meant anything to her.\" As a child, Nova had a liking for framberries. She dislikes sushi. An psyche profile of Nova conducted by a Dominion wrangler concluded that Nova is fiercely loyal to the Dominion, though noted that she had a slight tendancy to deviate from mission parameters based on personal evaluation of the situation. The wrangler noted that this might be due to residual subconcious memories of her past prior to entering the Ghost Academy.Other Appearances  Blizzard Entertainment employees have stated that they definitely want to continue Nova's story, either in novel or comic format. At BlizzCon 2011, Brian T. Kindregan asserted that Nova is an important part of the StarCraft universe, and that she would be appearing in future expansions and stories. It was indicated that she would have a role in Legacy of the Void as well, though she makes no appearance in the game. Nova was expected to appear in StarCraft: Issue 9, trailing the War Pigs, a group of outlaws, for unknown reasons. However, the issue was canceled. She was scheduled to appear in the graphic novel that would continue the series, but the project has since been put on the backburner. Nova made early cameos in StarCraft II before the release of the game, seen on a flatscreen in the Hyperion. The images were of gameplay from StarCraft: Ghost. A Nova skin is available for Widowmaker in Overwatch.World of Warcraft Easter Eggs  Nova's tomb had been spotted at a strange stone in the Netherstorm of World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade at location 41, 83.Drysc, a Blizzard World of Warcraft Community Manager later stated that  A cloaked blood elf figure resembling Nova can also be found near the tomb. Drysc used the lyrics of Kansas song Dust in the Wind to describe her: Another blood elf character named Nova can be found in World of Warcraft. She is a child who keeps a pet cat.Notes Collectables Hybrid  The protoss/zerg hybrid is a perverse fusion of the protoss and zerg species. Described as \"false xel'naga\", they were the ultimate weapons of the fallen xel'naga Amon and were key to his plan to remake creation in his image.Overview  The xel'naga regularly seeded the universe with life as part of their Infinite Cycle. Over many generations, two species, one with the \"purity of form\" and another with the \"purity of essence\", would come together naturally. Their xel'naga progenitors would then transfer their essence to them, giving rise to a new generation of xel'naga, which would repeat the cycle. The xel'naga Amon, however, viewed this cycle as corrupt and flawed. He desired to remake the universe in his own image. To this end, he and his followers violated the xel'naga's rule of non-intervention, and uplifted the protoss and the zerg, with the intention of merging the two species to create the hybrid. Contrary to the xel'naga's intent, the hybrids were the result of a perversion of their Infinite Cycle, as their creation would not lead to the rebirth of the true xel'naga. Overt knowledge of the hybrids began spreading among the terrans, protoss, and zerg, after the Brood War, and most who knew understood the dire threat the hybrids posed to the universe. Hybrids possess a Consume DNA ability which inflicts harm on whatever it is used against. Hybrids would preferentially attack protoss and zerg with it and in an apocalyptic future, they used this ability to finish off the Zerg Swarm. The thoughts of hybrids have been described as \"red hate\".History The Grand Experiment  The xel'naga were a species that reproduced by seeding the universe with life. In time, two species would emerge, one that was \"pure of form\" and the other \"pure of essence\". Inevitably, these two species would, through peaceful means, come together and merge enabling their xel'naga creators to pass their essence onto them, thus giving rise to the next generation of xel'naga. Although the xel'naga watched over the younger races, they never interfered with their evolution or development. One xel'naga, Amon, viewed this cycle as corrupt and saw it as the source of all suffering in the universe. After gathering a group of like-minded followers, Amon set out to find two races he could uplift and groom to create the perfect life form that would end the cycle. He first uplifted the protoss of Aiur to be pure in form, before departing to the world of Zerus where he uplifted the zerg, which he considered to be pure of essence. As part of his plan, he created the Overmind, a collection of zerg sentience, in order to enforce a purity of essence. The Overmind's free will was undermined by an overriding directive to destroy the protoss. This was part of a greater plan by Amon to remold creation in his own image. The Overmind defied Amon's manipulations, but could do little to resist. It would later attempt to undermine Amon by creating the Queen of Blades as a way to bypass its directive. When the other xel'naga discovered Amon's experiments and tried to put a stop to them, Amon unleashed the Overmind and the Swarm against the xel'naga worldships over Zerus. The Swarm wiped out the majority of the xel'naga, throwing the Infinite Cycle into turmoil. The Swarm then embarked into space to \"complete\" the xel'naga's work by absorbing the protoss. The protoss became aware that it wished to finish the xel'naga experiments. Tassadar destroyed the Overmind, believing it would \"run rampant throughout the stars, consuming all sentience &ndash; all life.\" Although the zerg desired to assimilate the protoss, the Khala and the Void protected the protoss from infestation, preventing the zerg from absorbing the protoss into their fold.Duran's Experiments  Fulfilling the machinations of Amon, Samir Duran worked to produce a perfected protoss/zerg hybrid as part of a stepping stone in order to create a much more powerful host body in order to sustain his master. By the end of the Brood War he had established development bases on multiple worlds and successfully created numerous specimens. The work was accelerated by Sarah Kerrigan's assimilation by the zerg. Duran claimed that \"this creature [was] the completion of a cycle. Its role in the cosmic order was preordained when the stars were young.\" One base on a dark moon was discovered accidentally by Dark Prelate Zeratul. He was en route from Char having killed the second Overmind for Kerrigan, and slain Matriarch Raszagal to save the Matriarch from Kerrigan's influence. The prelate sought to find and rendezvous with Praetor Artanis and thought the protoss energy signatures emanating from the moon were from protoss stragglers or the praetor's forces. Zeratul led a party to the surface and found not protoss but a hybrid development base instead. He was puzzled by terran mercenaries seemingly using protoss technology, and the protoss, zerg, and infested terran specimens in stasis cells. Zeratul was horrified when they discovered the hybrid specimen's cell. The prelate was disturbed further when he was contacted by Duran, who told him the experiments were being sponsored by a greater power and specimens were secreted on multiple worlds. Zeratul destroyed the hybrid before departing. Zeratul was unable to explain his unnerving discovery and kept it secret but embarked on a solitary fact finding journey in 2503.Zeratul and Ulrezaj  Ulrezaj created strange creatures which he kept in vats in an underground city underneath Aiur, sometime after the Fall of Aiur. Their true nature is unknown, but they have psionic powers and his loyal Tal'darim were taught to trap zerg for him. The creatures were kept secret from the Tal'darim, whom Ulrezaj was draining for their energy. Jake Ramsey, a terran archaeologist with a preserver, Zamara, embedded in his mind, located these creatures in 2502. Zamara suggested they may be a type of hybrid. Zeratul encountered Zamara shortly afterward, and they exchanged information. He told her about the hybrid he saw on the dark moon, and she told him about the xel'naga cycle. According to Zamara, Samir Duran's experiments are a \"perversion\" of what was to be, and if his attempts to \"unify\" the species become successful, it will result in \"a monstrous and powerful perversion of both protoss and zerg will be set loose upon the universe, and all that we know and cherish will fall in their wake\".The Second Great War Zhakul Hybrid  The hybrid were released on the eve of the Second Great War. The hybrid destroyer Maar went to the protoss archive world of Zhakul and attempted to leech the energies of preservers. It also subverted the planet's defenders, the Zhakul Guardians, into protecting it. The hybrid was ultimately stopped by Zeratul who came to the planet to consult with the preservers regarding the ancient xel'naga prophecy which Zeratul had recently discovered.Terran Dominion Experiments  By a few years prior to the Second Great War, the Terran Dominion had initiated a Hybrid Breeding Program, based out of Skygeirr. The Dominion also conducted hybrid experiments at a secret facility orbiting Castanar. The gene splicing technology was far more advanced than anything the terrans had, suggesting the Dominion had help. Discovering the facility, Raynor's Raiders attacked it, discovering numerous hybrids being \"cloned\" within. They destroyed the fusion core, causing a containment field to weaken and a particularly powerful hybrid reaver emerged. The Raiders fled as it went on a rampage, attacking protoss, zerg and terrans alike.Transfer of Energy  Alexei Stukov theorized that hybrid collected the energy used when the Keystone deinfested Sarah Kerrigan. This energy would later be used to resurrect Amon.Moebius Foundation Experiments  Prior to 2504, Dr. Emil Narud of the Moebius Foundation created at least three hybrid on Space Station Prometheus, something which he did not keep secret from his benefactor, Valerian Mengsk. However, Narud concealed from him how far his experiments had gone. Each of the hybrid had a markedly different appearance. During a conflict following the Battle of Char, Narud betrayed Valerian Mengsk by unleashing the hybrid against him and Raynor. Arcturus Mengsk, who also knew about these hybrid, contacted Valerian and Raynor and informed them that Narud could pacify the hybrid with a specific psionic signal - if the two surrendered to the Dominion. However, an uninfested, recovering Sarah Kerrigan unleashed her psionic powers on the hybrid, killing two of them. The third hybrid protected Narud as he escaped the station with the xel'naga artifact. The dropship Fanfare then killed the final hybrid.Skygeirr Station  Hybrid dominators were encountered by Kerrigan and her forces on Skygeirr Station, led by Narud. They broke free of containment, overcame the Dominion forces assigned to oversee them, and remotely attacked Kerrigan through psionic means. However, the zerg were able to overcome them. Narud made a final stand at a series of xel'naga shrines further in the station. His loyal Tal'darim faced Stukov and Kerrigan, and many hybrid reavers fought alongside the Tal'darim. Stukov led the zerg to victory, however. Kerrigan faced Narud in single combat, where Narud revealed his shapeshifter abilities. Kerrigan stabbed Narud, but as the shapeshifter lay dying, he revealed that Amon had already been revived.Legacy of the Void Prelude to Oblivion  In the aftermath of the Second Great War, the hybrid began to awaken and seize control of the Moebius Corps and Moebius Foundation terrans that were creating them, turning them into thralls. One such facility was the Revanscar facility, where the majority of hybrids were created. A number of hybrids controlled Moebius Corps troops at a base. Zeratul and Kerrigan discovered them. They killed many of the thralls and Zeratul's troops slew the hybrids. Zeratul was there to find Amon's rebirth place, and believed that slaying the hybrid was meaningless, as he needed to find the xel'naga to defeat Amon instead. Zeratul and Praetor Talis's forces later attacked the Temple of Erris on Atrias. The Tal'darim had failed to keep Zeratul out, and attacked Talis's forces outside the temple. Hybrid joined in the assault. Within the temple, Zeratul fought more Tal'darim troops, including hybrid. Highlord Ma'lash, seemed to hold hybrid reavers in high esteem, but Zeratul could still fight them. Amon emerged from the void, summoning shadows of the void to attack Zeratul along with hybrid. Zeratul was forced to flee before Amon destroyed the temple.End War  Meanwhile, the Daelaam launched their first attempt to reclaim Aiur. Hierarch Artanis was warned by Zeratul of Amon's plans, but chose to ignore him. During the battle to reclaim the warp conduits on the planet, Amon's hybrid forces began to coordinate the Amon Brood zerg attacks against the protoss. When the Daelaam sieged the final warp conduit, hybrid forces appeared to directly intercede in its defense. The appearance of the hybrid convinced Artanis to act against Amon, and prepared his forces for the coming war. However, Amon seized control of the Khala, and sent hybrid forces alongside corrupted protoss and Amon Brood zerg against Artanis's few uncontrolled protoss forces. He then released the hybrid alongside of his armies to begin his galactic conquest. During Amon's assault on Shakuras, Amon held his hybrid forces back and used zerg forces to test the Daelaam defenses of the planet. During the final assault on the xel'naga temple of Shakuras, Amon sent his hybrid through the planet's warp gate and used them to besiege the temple. The assault was unsuccessful in destroying the temple in time, and Amon's forces on the planet were annihilated when the temple's overloaded phase prism destroyed the planet. Hybrid were also present during Moebius Corps's siege of Korhal. When Moebius Corps retrieved the Keystone and retreated to Bennet Port, hybrid appeared to aid in its defense, and Hybrid dominators channeled void energy into the Keystone to stun all terran forces. This attack did not effect the Daelaam forces aiding the Terran Dominion, which were able to push through the energy surges and retrieve the Keystone. The hybrid and Moebius Corps were pushed from Korhal. When Artanis found his way to Ulnar with the intention of resurrecting the slumbering xel'naga there, he found Sarah Kerrigan engaged with hybrid forces. The two fought them off, and she revealed she had been fighting them off for days. The two fought through hybrid that barred their path to uncover the secrets of the ruins, but found the xel'naga already dead when they arrived. When Amon opened a rift to the Void to destroy Artanis and Kerrigan, he sent hybrid forces to stop them from destroying the void crystals powering the portal. The defense failed, and the crystals were destroyed. When the Daelaam attempted to reawaken the Purifiers on Cybros, hybrid forces were sent to reinforce the Amon Brood that landed on the platform. These were destroyed alongside the zerg when the Purifiers awakened and cleansed the station. During the Daelaam's attempts to instate First Ascendant Alarak as Highlord, hybrid forces guarded the Guardians of Ma'lash and supplemented the Tal'darim forces. When Alarak finally fought Ma'lash in Rak'Shir, hybrid channeled their psionic energy to Ma'lash to help him defeat Alarak. However, this failed, and Alarak revealed that Amon's promise to the Tal'darim that they would ascend into hybrid was a lie. As such, he commanded the Tal'darim to destroy Amon and his forces. During the conflict, Matriarch Vorazun sent her best dark templar to track down the facility where the hybrids were being created. Her scouts eventually discovered Revanscar, and the Daelaam set a course for the facility. However, Moebius Corps battlecruisers trapped them, and hybrid forces began to board the Spear of Adun. Phase-smith Karax lead the assault on the facility itself, destroying its power generators. The Spear of Adun fired on the facility, ending Moebius Corps as a threat and destroying their hybrid breeding operations. As the Daelaam returned to reclaim Aiur, they first sought to delay the corrupted Golden Armada's arrival by destroying the planet's psionic matrix. After the first khaydarin crystal powering the matrix was destroyed, hybrid defenders were sent alongside corrupted Khalai protoss to defend the second. Karax and Talandar reclaimed a force of robotic units, and used them to break through the hybrid lines and destroy the second crystal. At the site of the dead Overmind, Amon had created a hybrid body from protoss flesh combined with that of the Overmind. Hybrid attempted to stop the Daelaam from destroying the void crystals defending Amon's host body, but the Daelaam broke through and unleashed a massive orbital bombardment on it, destroying Amon's host and leaving only the Khala left for him to inhabit. Over the course of the End War, Amon deployed hybrid across the sector, and were forced to be defeated the commanders of the different factions of the sector. Amon attempted to summon a voidshade hybrid on a protoss colony world, but it was discovered by the Nerazim Lyrak, who alerted two allied commanders. The commanders were successful in destroying the void slivers protecting the voidshade hybrid and bombarding it before it could be resurrected. Terran Dominion forces under General Carolina Davis discovered that the Moebius Foundation were breeding Moebius hybrids in a secret facility. The general called on two allied commanders, and acquired an experimental Archangel named the Balius to destroy the hybrids. The combined forces were successful in slaying all Moebius hybrid in the facility.Armageddon  The Overmind's apocalyptic vision of the future remained unknown at large until Prelate Zeratul sought out the creature's memories. He sought greater understanding to a dire prophecy from Ulaan foretelling the end of the xel'naga cycle. The prelate learned of the Overmind's vision through Tassadar's spirit. In it, the zerg were enslaved by Amon and the hybrids after the death of Kerrigan. The terrans were soon annihilated. The combined hybrid-zerg force destroyed the protoss, before turning on and eliminating the zerg as well.Known Hybrid Types  Three other types of hybrid were bred aboard Space Station Prometheus but were not named. One was a six-legged creature with mutalisk features. The other was a squat, blue iridescent creature with the skull of a protoss and the jaws of a zergling. One had a serpentine body, with pincers and bone wings similar to that of Sarah Kerrigan.Individuals Notes Zeratul  Zeratul was a revered Nerazim mystic. During the Great War, Zeratul allied with the Khalai Tassadar, despite his hatred for the Conclave that once banished his forbears. The Dark Templar personally slew the cerebrate Zasz, but in turn accidentally gave the Overmind the location of Aiur. Zeratul was manipulated by Sarah Kerrigan during the Brood War into killing the Second Overmind and Raszagal, the Dark Templar Matriarch. These events, and the discovery of the hybrids, led Zeratul to go into seclusion to contemplate his actions and investigate. As the Second Great War approached he began to take a more active role once again.Biography  By the Great War, Zeratul had spent \"many decades\" away from Shakuras on missions. When Zeratul reached the rank of prelate, he was presented with a custom set of armor, as was tradition among the Nerazim. This was the Shadow-walker's Embrace. However, he would rarely don the armor, as he preferred less formal attire.The Great War Char  During the Great War, Zeratul reacted to Sarah Kerrigan's psionic call from Char by taking his small force there, seeking to end the zerg's expansion. On Char, Zeratul met the former protoss executor Tassadar, a member of the Templar Caste, and the terran Jim Raynor. Tassadar reacted badly upon his meeting with this leader of a forbidden caste and attacked Zeratul. However, Zeratul refused to take offense, even attempting to teach Tassadar the art of combat (while avoiding being struck). Eventually Zeratul overcame Tassadar's prejudice, beginning to heal the rifts between the Khalai and the Dark Templar. The two leaders (and Jim Raynor) came to an understanding, joining forces and hiding from the zerg. After the rebirth of Sarah Kerrigan as the Queen of Blades, Tassadar distracted her long enough for Zeratul to slay Zasz, cerebrate and leader of the Garm Brood. This created a connection between Zeratul and the Overmind, which enabled Zeratul to discern the Overmind's motives and the Overmind to discern the secret location of Aiur. Not all the Overmind's secrets were learned at the time, as its mental defenses were still active. As their friendship grew, Zeratul also began teaching Tassadar how to use the Dark Templar's Void-based psionic energies, a task that was considered blasphemous by Judicator Aldaris. During the teachings, Tassadar underwent a Shadow Walk. He would meet the preserver Zamara and revealed to her a pair of secrets; that Dark Templar could store memories and that he sometimes used a pink-skied world as a sanctuary. Kerrigan led a devastating attack against the protoss on Char. Kerrigan and Zeratul exchanged words and insults during the battle. Zeratul told her of a prophecy: \"Your coming has been foretold... You are part of the culmination. But not the end of it. You shall show the way, the path that must be taken, the realigning of old truths no longer valid. Yours is not the hand, but your very existence provides necessary instruction.\" Tassadar escaped due to the arrival of protoss reinforcements while Zeratul and a small number of other Dark Templar were captured and herded into a terran installation. Meanwhile the victorious zerg traveled to Aiur, where they won many victories against the protoss defenders.Rescue and Rebellion  Tassadar, reinforced by protoss troops sent from Aiur (in order to arrest him), launched an attack on the zerg guarding the infested installation. Once inside, he allied with stranded terran troops, fought his way past the zerg inside, and found Zeratul and his Dark Templar. Tassadar convinced him to return with him to Aiur. Together they fled to Aiur, where they gained the support of Praetor Fenix. The Conclave had branded Tassadar a traitor and sought to arrest him and execute Zeratul. Tassadar was shocked that they would \"cling to their failing traditions\" even as the zerg threatened them with annihilation. Tassadar decided he would fight the Conclave, as they threatened the very warriors that could defeat the zerg. Together, Tassadar, Zeratul, and Fenix assaulted Kor-shakal, but Tassadar was distraught by the infighting and surrendered himself to Aldaris. Zeratul and his Dark Templar vanished, leaving the new Executor and Fenix to continue their rebellion with little support. Fenix's forces, with the help of Raynor, attacked the stasis cell in which Tassadar was incarcerated and was awaiting trial and execution. Fenix and Raynor defeated the Conclave forces and destroyed the cell, freeing Tassadar. Aldaris then reappeared, leading a last-ditch attack to recapture Tassadar, but he was in turn ambushed by Zeratul and his Dark Templar. Zeratul demanded that Aldaris's guards stand down and Tassadar be released. Aldaris was not forthcoming, but Zeratul and Tassadar were able to depart.The Fall of the Overmind  Zeratul and his allies survived Aldaris' attack, and plotted their attack on the zerg. Zeratul told the allies the real reason the Overmind was so dangerous; it had attacked the xel'naga, and if it defeated the protoss it would consume all sentient life throughout the stars. Fenix planned to lead his forces against the primary zerg hive clusters, thinning out their numbers, while Zeratul would infiltrate the clusters and slay a pair of cerebrates. Zeratul successfully assassinated the cerebrates, weakening the Overmind's defenses. As the protoss led by Zeratul and his allies, along with Raynor and his troops prepared the final assault, Aldaris apologized to Tassadar, admitting that the Dark Templar really were required for fighting the zerg. During the battle, the Gantrithor was critically damaged. Tassadar sacrificed himself to destroy the Overmind, using the Dark Templar techniques taught to him by Zeratul.The Brood War Dark Refuge  The zerg ran rampant over all of Aiur, killing almost seventy percent of its population. Zeratul, striking an alliance with Aldaris and the new Praetor Artanis, concluded that the protoss must retreat to the Dark Templar homeworld of Shakuras through the last remaining warp gate, abandoning Aiur. Aldaris reluctantly agreed, after Zeratul convinced him that the Dark Templar would be more welcoming of him than the Conclave would have welcomed the Dark Templar. Zeratul personally led the refugees to the warp gate, where Fenix and Raynor, were awaiting their arrival. They stayed behind to protect the refugees. The zerg followed the protoss through the warp gate to Shakuras. Zeratul eventually met with Matriarch Raszagal and informed her of the fall of Aiur. Both Raszagal and Aldaris agreed that the zerg were a great threat to Shakuras, and Raszagal proposed a solution; activate the xel'naga temple which could scour the zerg from Shakuras. However, activating it required using the lost twin crystals, the Uraj (laced with Templar energies), and the Khalis (which used Dark Templar energies). First, she required that the zerg, especially their two cerebrates, be removed from the grounds of the temple. Following the deaths of the two cerebrates at the hands of the Dark Templar, Kerrigan made an appearance, saying she had information to deliver. Zeratul and Aldaris were not trusting of her, but Raszagal wished to speak with Kerrigan at her Citadel. Kerrigan told the protoss that a new Overmind was growing on Char, created from the merging of a number of cerebrates. Zeratul found this hard to believe, and in any event his first priority was protecting Shakuras. Kerrigan offered to help him in this task. Meanwhile, Aldaris had stormed out the meeting because Raszagal was willing to listen to Kerrigan. Raszagal insisted the former enemies worked together. She told them to find the Uraj crystal on the world of Braxis, and \"let nothing stop you from recovering it.\"Uraj and Khalis  Kerrigan personally assisted in the mission on Braxis, an icy world recently settled by the Terran Dominion; the crystal was recovered. When the protoss tried to leave Braxis, however, they met a surprise: the United Earth Directorate. Vice Admiral Alexei Stukov had constructed a series of missile turrets on a space platform over Braxis, which would prevent the protoss from escaping. Stukov demanded the surrender of the protoss. Zeratul wondered why these terrans had come all the way from Earth; Artanis thought Zeratul had no reason to fear them. Zeratul counseled Artanis on this attitude. Artanis, incensed at Stukov's attitude, personally lead the protoss forces against the UED from his Scout. However, his assault bogged down as the UED defended the fusion reactors which powered the missile turrets, with Zeratul dispatching reinforcements when necessary. With this aid, Artanis destroyed the fusion reactors, shutting down the missile turrets, and allowing the escape of the protoss. The next destination was Char, where Zeratul had felt the emanations of the powerful Khalis crystal during his previous adventures there. Unfortunately, the Overmind had nestled quite close to it. Kerrigan suggested snatching the crystal, while Artanis preferred doing enough subdual damage to the Overmind in order to pacify its minions. Zeratul complimented Artanis on his plan, saying he had as much courage as Tassadar. The protoss descended on the world, and, after Kerrigan granted them assistance by taking control of a zerg hive cluster, retrieved the crystal.The Insurgent  Upon his return, Zeratul found Shakuras in a state of uproar. Aldaris had taken control of the Judicator and Templar refugees, and led them in an attack against Raszagal herself. Raszagal claimed they were being driven by their old prejudices, and ordered Zeratul and Artanis to terminate Aldaris. She would tolerate no dissent while the zerg were poised to strike. Zeratul felt that something was wrong. Raszagal had always been a gentle soul, he told Artanis. Still, he followed her orders. Aldaris' forces were defeated, and Zeratul and Artanis closed in on him. They tried to convince him to return to the fold. However, Aldaris revealed that someone was manipulating Raszagal... but Kerrigan arrived and killed him before he could say more. For this act, Kerrigan was ordered to leave the planet. Kerrigan boasted that she had manipulated the protoss into killing her enemies, the cerebrates of the new Overmind, and told them she would see them \"real soon\". Raszagal assured him that, now that Kerrigan had left, she was back to herself.Fury of the Xel'Naga  The final assault was made against the zerg on Shakuras. While the main forces would surround and protect the temple, Zeratul would personally bring the Khalis inside it, while Artanis would bring the Uraj. The protoss successfully defended the temple from the zerg as it \"powered up\". The temple was activated, destroying the zerg invaders.Dark Vengeance  Following the scouring of the zerg from Shakuras and the destruction of the warp gate on Aiur, Zeratul took part in a conflict with the Fist of Ulrezaj, a Dark Templar terrorist movement devoted to the destruction of the Templar Caste. Zeratul and Artanis planned to retrieve a number of fallen heroes stranded on Aiur. The warriors had been stored in a trio of stasis cells which were now surrounded by renegade zerg broods, and so Artanis ordered Zeratul and Executor Selendis on a covert mission to rescue who they could and ascertain if a greater rescue mission was possible. Zeratul's forces cut through to the stasis cells, but when they did so a quartet of Dark Templar appeared, destroying two of the cells and cursing the high-born Templar before they were arrested. The remaining hero, Eredas, was rescued. Zeratul, Artanis and Selendis became aware of protoss survivors stranded on Aiur but, believing they could not be rescued, let them be and kept their existence a secret. At Shakuras, Zeratul and a Tribunal deliberated on the fate of Ulrezaj and the other three captured Dark Templar. Zeratul called Ulrezaj a traitor to his race for murdering the warriors, and was angry at him for clinging to his old hatreds. Ulrezaj and his warriors were sentenced to death. However, a mysterious terran force attacked the protoss, interrupting the conversation. The terrans freed Ulrezaj and his companions from the stasis cells being used to imprison them, and during the confusion of the battle they were able to steal a khaydarin crystal. Zeratul's forces pursued the stolen crystal, tracking its signature to Korhal. It was guarded by a number of zerg, who were working with renegade terrans. Zeratul was surprised by this development, and after being told that the terrans may be using the crystal to control zerg, ordered it retrieved. The crystal was successfully retrieved, only to reveal a shocking development; it wasn't the stolen crystal. Instead, it was a \"dark copy\" made from a fusion of Dark Templar and Zerg energies. Five strange copies were tracked to Char, where they were being used to control several zerg hive clusters. Zeratul wanted to destroy the crystals, and stated that only a dark archon was capable of this. A small force of heroes, including a Dark Archon Hero, were inserted onto Char while Zeratul's main forces distracted the enemy. Zeratul believed he could only keep the enemy away from an hour. The five crystals were destroyed. Meanwhile, Ulrezaj and his terran minion, Alan Schezar, had hatched a second plot. They created a powerful EMP generator, placing it on a space platform over Shakuras. The Generator weakened the shields and energies of Shakuras' troops. Zeratul asked Ulrezaj to give up his hatred of the protoss of Aiur, stating that he had learned to fight alongside them, but Ulrezaj replied that the wounds could never truly heal. Zeratul ordered his forces to destroy Schezar's Scavengers and the Fist of Ulrezaj forces. Slaying Alan Schezar caused his forces to surrender. Zeratul's forces were victorious, destroying the Generator and defeating the Fist of Ulrezaj.Kerrigan's Betrayal  Kerrigan wasn't done with the protoss yet. Her forces, led by Samir Duran, invaded Shakuras and kidnapped Raszagal from the well-fortified city of Talematros (and destroying it in the process). This drew an immediate reaction from Zeratul, who appeared at Char in an \"unidentified\" Carrier. Zeratul demanded an explanation from Kerrigan. She replied that she wasn't really interested in Raszagal, but in him and his brethren. She intended to use Raszagal as leverage; if Zeratul's Dark Templar slew the Overmind, she would \"allow\" the Matriarch to return to him. Zeratul didn't trust her, but Raszagal convinced him to work with Kerrigan, stating that the Overmind was their common enemy. Kerrigan's forces launched a joint attack with the Dark Templar against the second Overmind, which was protected by its Zerg minions and the UED forces which had taken control of it. The zerg/protoss \"alliance\" was successful; Zeratul personally slew the Overmind, then demanded the return of the Matriarch. However, Raszagal refused to return. Zeratul's forces whisked Raszagal away, infuriating Kerrigan. Zeratul placed her in a stasis cell as he awaited dimensional recall, which took at least half an hour. However, this was enough time for Kerrigan to defeat his forces, but forced her to place the majority of her forces on the surface of Char, and away from the space platforms (her first line of defense). In anguish, Zeratul broke the stasis cell and killed the Matriach. With her dying thoughts, Matriach Raszagal made Zeratul the leader of her people. Nonetheless, the death of Raszagal caused Zeratul immense guilt and had prolonged psychological effects. Kerrigan derived sadistic pleasure by allowing him to live with that burden. Zeratul felt unfit for Raszagal's gift of leadership.Dark Origin  Zeratul fled with his small warband, attempting to find Artanis and other protoss warriors, but failed. Instead, he located a dark moon with protoss energy signatures. On the moon he fought terran mercenaries and rescued several protoss prisoners, including an archon. He also discovered experiments performed on zerg for the creation of a zerg/protoss hybrid. He was even more surprised when Samir Duran revealed himself as the mastermind of this grand experiment, despite his former status as a member of the Zerg Swarm. Duran told Zeratul that Kerrigan was not in charge of his experiment, \"although her rebirth into the Zerg Swarm has sped up [his] progress.\" Duran also told him that he was \"a servant of a far greater power\". Zeratul felt the hybrid was a great threat, and Duran agreed, saying \"this creature is the completion of a cycle. Its role in the cosmic order was preordained when the stars were young. Behold the culmination of your history.\" Its coming would \"change the universe ... forever.\" Zeratul stared at it in horror before destroying it, along with the rest of the facility. Zeratul left the dark moon, troubled and unable to tell the other protoss what he had experienced. He returned to Shakuras, made his farewells to Raynor, then departed. He entered a self-imposed exile with only a handful of followers at his side as he began searching for the truth of the xel'naga's apparent return. He believed that this prophecy of their return had been imparted by a benevolent force in a bid to provide assistance to the protoss (and perhaps, multiple races) in a time of need. He came to suspect that the zerg had fallen under the control of dark forces.Travels in the Dark  In 2503, a soul sick Zeratul was found on a pink-skied planet by an unlikely pair: Jake Ramsey, a terran archaeologist, carrying within his brain the mind of Zamara, a protoss preserver. Zamara's presence was killing Ramsey. The duo convinced the solitary dark templar to talk by recounting how they had been merged together. In return Zeratul shared a Nerazim tale about Adun and the Nerazim belief that Adun would one day return to save the protoss. When told of Rosemary Dahl, Zeratul wondered if she was trustworthy. This was a sentiment shared by other protoss on Shakurus as the only noteworthy terran female they had encountered was Sarah Kerrigan. This led to a discussion about Matriarch Raszagal. A reluctant Zeratul eventually revealed to Ramsey and Zamara that he had killed the Matriarch upon her request, which he considered an act of dishonor forced upon him by Kerrigan. Ramsey's shock at this revelation was tempered by the reasoning behind the act; he believed it was an honorable act because Raszagal requested it in order to be freed of Kerrigan's influence. Zamara repeated Raszagal's final words and shared them with Ramsey. The archaeologist angered Zeratul by insisting Raszagal would have been disappointed with the dark templar, as he hadn't taken her place as leader of the Nerazim as she had requested. Zeratul lost control, strangling Ramsey but not killing him. He sent them away. In time, Zeratul realized the truth of Ramsey's words and went to find the pair in the jungle. The prelate told them of his first encounter with the dark archon Ulrezaj, and then requested Zamara to share a secret she had been safeguarding. The preserver revealed xel'naga were long-lived but not immortal, and could no longer breed. They intended to preserve themselves by uplifting two species, embodying the purity of form and the purity of essence, and then over eons peacefully merging the two to create the xel'naga \"reborn\". This was \"as natural to them as breathing is to [terrans], or as gathering nutrients is to [protoss]\". This put some perspective on Zeratul's experience with Samir Duran at the end of the Brood War. Zeratul, Ramsey, and Zamara traveled together for the settlement of Alys'aril on the the moon Ehlna. Alys'aril was where the Dark Templar stored their memories in special khaydarin crystals and Zamara could be removed. Once there the preserver shared with Zeratul the location of a xel'naga temple with a live energy creature still inside. Ramsey was familiar with the nearby planet and identified it as Pegasus. Zeratul arrived on Pegasus just in time to witness the energy creature emerge and depart into space. The prelate followed it to a gathering of dozens, possibly hundreds, of other energy creatures. The creatures then created a wormhole through which Zeratul traveled to the mysterious planet at the other end. He found something that put him on the path to finding the prophecy he searched after.Resuming the Search  As the Second Great War approached, Zeratul returned to the stars aboard Void Seeker to search for clues into the hybrids and Samir Duran. He dedicated himself to finding the prophecy he sought, believing it could aid his people in the dark times to come. He tracked the prophecy he sought to Ulaan, where it was stored in fragments. Kerrigan was searching for the prophecy as well and arrived before him. The two sparred briefly. The prelate learned Kerrigan was pessimistic that the coming darkness could not be stopped, but eventually slipped away after inflicting superficial damage on the Queen of Blades. With the aid and sacrifice of a protoss force led by High Templar Karass, Zeratul escaped the zerg with the prophetic fragments. He took them to the archive world of Zhakul where preservers would be able to decipher the fragments' meaning. However, darker forces reached the preservers before Zeratul. Upon arriving at Zhakul, he encountered his greatest fear: a hybrid. This hybrid destroyer, Maar, had imprisoned the three preservers the prelate sought and was leeching their energies. Maar had also corrupted the Zhakul Guardians to serve him. Zeratul's forces fought and defeated Maar and freed the preservers. The mystics deciphered more of the prophecy. It mentioned the \"Great Hungerer\", which Zeratul took to mean the Overmind. Zeratul departed for Aiur to extract the memories from the dead creature's cortex. When he attempted to commune with the cortex, Zeratul was surprised to be met by Ouros using the guise of Tassadar who conveyed the Overmind's memories. The Overmind was an unwilling pawn of Amon, the same entity behind the recent rise of the hybrids, driven to destroy the protoss by an overriding directive implanted when it was young. It had foreseen that final victory for the Dark Voice and the hybrids would result in the destruction of the terrans, protoss, and zerg. To prevent that future, the Overmind created the Queen of Blades. Zeratul was only convinced when, through who he believed was Tassadar, he experienced the Overmind's apocalyptic vision of the future and the last stand of the protoss. Without Kerrigan, the Dark Voice had taken control of the Swarm, and used it and the hybrids to destroy the protoss.The Second Great War  Zeratul recorded what he had learned into an Ihan crystal. During the Second Great War, he clandestinely boarded the Hyperion and gave the crystal to Raynor. Zeratul warned Raynor to ensure Kerrigan's survival, and cryptically alluded to both her pivotal role and the coming struggle with the hybrids. He urged Raynor to review the crystal's contents and then departed. When Zeratul boarded Kerrigan's leviathan, she attacked him on sight. After enduring a brief beating, Zeratul telepathically showed her Zerus, the birthplace of the zerg. The primal zerg that reside there constantly fight to survive and evolve. He told her to go there to gain the power to challenge the fallen xel'naga, Amon. On the surface, Zeratul explained that the xel'naga wished to see her restored as the leader of the Swarm. He acted on behalf of the greater good, even if his actions would earn him the hatred of his people. When they were done on Zerus, he would return to his kind and face their judgment.Whispers of Oblivion Dark Whispers  Having delivered his warnings to both Raynor and Kerrigan, Zeratul was left to wonder what part the protoss would play in the looming conflict. Before returning to his people, he embarked on a search to find the last part of the prophecy, hoping they would provide insight into how to stop Amon. It was said that on the world were Amon was reborn, the last light would be revealed. At some point, he learnt of the death of Duran (or Narud, as he had called himself at the time of his death). With the end of the Second Great War, Zeratul learnt of Artanis's intent to reclaim Aiur. He set off alone in his search, hoping that Artanis was not making a terrible mistake. One year later, as Zeratul's search continued, he was contacted by Praetor Talis, who requested his aid. An unknown force had been abducting Templar from Daelaam worlds. They had traced them to a Moebius Foundation base, but were under attack by the zerg. Zeratul took the Void Seeker to her location. Arriving at the base, Zeratul was contacted by Kerrigan, demanding to know why he was here. He gave his reasons, but Kerrigan did not stay her attack\u2014the facility was being used to breed hybrids for Amon, and she would destroy it. She warned Zeratul to stay out of her way, and continued the assault. Not discouraged, Zeratul and Talis led their forces to free their breathren, timing their attacks so they avoided being caught up in the Swarm's rampage. As they freed their breathren, they learnt that the Templar had been captured for experimentation. Moving on, Kerrigan contacted Zeratul, who told her that slaying the hybrid was meaningless, and that they had to awaken the xel'naga. Kerrigan fell silent for the rest of the battle. Reaching the last group of prisoners, the protoss learnt that the Tal'darim had been behind the abductions, delivering the Templar to terran stations for transformation into hybrids. Zeratul realized that Amon was involved. The Templar told him that they had been held in the Temple of Erris, and by using the station's data, Zeratul was able to deduce that the structure was located on Atrias. The planet where Amon was reborn. Talis pledged her services to Zeratul, intent on repaying him for his aid.The Battle of Atrias  The protoss arrived at Atrias, finding the planet in its death throes. They deployed outside the temple, finding the Tal'darim in force under the command of Highlord Ma'lash, intent on repelling them. The Daelaam fought their way to the temple entrance. Talis and her forces held the entrance against counterattack, while Zeratul and a force of stalkers entered the temple. They made their way through as Talis and her forces came under counterattack. Despite this, she offerred support to Zeratul if he could take out the temple's particle cannons. Eventually, Zeratul caught sight of the central chamber. There, he observed Ma'lash communing with Amon via void catalyst. Amon ordered that the Tal'darim make ready for war, and await his command. At Talis's suggestion, Zeratul decided to destroy the conduit, as through doing so, it would cripple the Tal'darim's command structure long enough for him to warn Artanis of the coming invasion. Zeratul and his warriors fought their way to the Void conduit, but Ma'lash escaped at the last moment. With all resistance eliminated, the Nerazim proceeded to destroy the conduit. With that done, a ghostly figure appeared before Zeratul, bearing the voice of Tassadar. Telling him that \"the Keystone shall usher you unto hope.\" He was granted a vision of the device's location on Korhal. Returning to the present, Zeratul declared that he had seen the means to his people's salvation. But then, Amon's voice boomed across the chamber. Salvation would come by his hand alone. And on that note, the temple began collapsing, as Amon dispatched shadows of the Void against the protoss. Zeratul and his companions were forced to flee, as Amon mocked them all the while. Zeratul managed to make it to the Void Seeker in time, as Talis and her forces stayed behind to hold off the Tal'darim. Zeratul departed, and gave thanks to Talis. As he piloted the Void Seeker, he reflected on what had transpired, believing that he had been given a vision from the xel'naga. While he mourned her loss, he resolved to find Artanis, and make the protoss understand the threat they faced. For in his mind, only Artanis could unite the protoss factions before Amon's wrath engulfed the galaxy. As he now had all the information he sought, he felt he could now warn Artanis of the threat.The Return to Aiur Dark Tidings  Believing that time was running out, Zeratul headed out to warn the protoss of the threat Amon represented. As the Golden Armada stood ready to launch its reclamation of Aiur, he appeared on the bridge of Artanis's ship. Executor Selendis ordered her zealots to arrest the prelate, but Artanis held them back, willing to hear Zeratul out. Zeratul warned them of Amon's return, and asked that the invasion be stopped so they could focus on the larger threat. Selendis refused to listen, calling Zeratul a traitor, and mentioning how his actions in the Great War had allowed the zerg to find Aiur all those years ago. Artanis, while more cordial, stated that too many had already given their lives for them to back out now. Thus, he ordered that the invasion commence. Zeratul observed how the protoss fought their way through the feral zerg in Kherrisan. He noticed, however, that one brood was showing signs of coordination, and that an unseen hand was guiding them. Artanis agreed, and the hand was soon revealed as hybrid reavers, much to Zeratul's shock. Nevertheless, the protoss were able to overcome their foes and gain control over the warp conduits on the surface. Artanis turned control of the invasion over to Selendis while he discussed matters with Zeratul further. Zeratul and Artanis came down to the surface of Aiur. He told Artanis of the Keystone, and how the prophecies spoke of xel'naga aiding the protoss in the end times. He believed that the Keystone would lead the protoss to their makers. Artanis instructed Zeratul to go to Korhal and obtain the Keystone from Raynor, while he marshaled his forces for the looming conflict.Death  Zeratul and his forces headed for the Void Seeker, only to find it had been destroyed by the zerg. Zeratul was perturbed\u2014the zerg in the area should have been eradicated. He ordered his stalkers to head to the nearest nexus point while he investigated further. Coming across the base, they found it abandoned, and the Templar without presence in the Khala. Something that should have been impossible without the severing of their nerve chords. To make matters worse, Selendis informed Zeratul that Artanis too was absent from the Khala. Selendis ordered Zeratul to raise an army to find Artanis, which he did so with the aid of Phase-smith Karax. As they moved on, Zeratul and his forces came under attack by corrupted protoss. Zeratul suspected that a hybrid had enslaved them. He contacted Selendis, but she too had fallen silent. He was contacted by Artanis, who was in the midst of succumbing to Amon's corruption of the Khala. Zeratul's own Khalai allies turned on him, and he was forced to flee. He headed for Artanis, forced to battle against his former allies. Eventually, he made it to Artanis. Zeratul urged Artanis to sever his nerve cords, as they were the Khalai's gestalt to the Khala. Zeratul moved to remove them, but Artanis parried his blow. With red eyes and a red psi-blade, Artanis rose, as Amon spoke through him. Soon, Amon had the upperhand. With a final blow, Zeratul was able to sever Artanis's appendages, freeing him from Amon's grasp. However, it was at the cost of Zeratul's life. Artanis rushed over and cradled Zeratul's body, watching as it collapsed to dust in his arms. All that was left was Zeratul's warp blade gauntlet, which Artanis took with him and wielded on his right hand until the end of the war.Legacy  Artanis carried the burden of Zeratul's death throughout much of the End War, and swore to carry out what he had begun. He retrieved the Keystone from Korhal after wresting it out of the control of Moebius Corps, and followed it to the xel'naga temple of Ulnar in hopes of gaining the aid of the xel'naga. However, when he arrived there he found the xel'naga had already been slain by Amon. Through much of the conflict, Matriarch Vorazun would to talk down on Zeratul's legacy, blaming him for the death of her mother Raszagal in spite of Artanis's protests. As the End War dragged on and the influence of Zeratul's intervention came clear, Vorazun began to concede that he was closer to the truth than anyone. By the conflict's end, Zeratul was mentioned via the \"en taro\" honorific, as Tassadar, Adun, and Khas had before him. Artanis would gather allies, destroy Amon's host body on Aiur and use the Keystone to remove Amon from the Khala. In the aftermath of the protoss victory, Artanis stated that it was all due to Zeratul. His warp blade gauntlet was placed on a grave overlooking one of the first cities to be rebuilt upon Aiur. Years later, as Raynor was reminiscing on his friends who had fallen, Zeratul's words from their last encounter ran through his head.In Utter Darkness  In the Overmind's apocalyptic vision of the future, Zeratul was present on a distant, shadowed world for the protoss' last stand against Amon. He led the initial army of the protoss. As several protoss heroes led reinforcements to Zeratul's position, he greeted each of them warmly. For all of their efforts, it was useless, as the protoss fell bravely. As he died he felt remorse that the protoss didn't act sooner against Amon.Game Unit StarCraft  Zeratul appears in StarCraft as a playable dark templar hero. Zeratul also appears in the form of the archon Tassadar/Zeratul. It does not appear in canon, but it is placeable in StarEdit.StarCraft II  Zeratul is playable as a hero unit in the protoss mini-campaign in Wings of Liberty. In Legacy of the Void, Zeratul appears in the Whispers of Oblivion prologue as well as in the main campaign. He is also set to be a commander in Co-op Missions. He can be purchased as an announcer for Versus mode.RISK: StarCraft  Zeratul appears as a hero unit in RISK: StarCraft.Heroes of the Storm  Zeratul is a playable character in Heroes of the StormPersonality and Traits  Zeratul has been warrior, vagabond, and mystic. Much of his life was spent in solitude, but this gave him unique insights into the art of battle, and the forces at play beneath the surface of any conflict. An enigmatic individual, Zeratul was somewhat secretive and calculating, but was nevertheless honorable and loyal to his species. He would have gladly risked anything to safeguard Aiur. He often spoke in riddles, preferring that others come up with the answers to the questions he put forward rather than answering them himself. He was a master of protoss psionics. He preferred to wear informal attire, and rarely donned his personal armor. Birthmarks were located on Zeratul's chest. Zeratul viewed himself as being responsible for the zerg's discovery of Aiur during the Great War, per his slaying of Zasz and through him, his mind connecting to that of the Overmind.Notes Hydralisk  The hydralisk is the zerg basic front-line creature, forming the backbone of their onslaughts with its resistant carapace and ranged spine attack.Overview  The hydralisk is a zerg evolution of the slothien. While slothiens were peaceful herbivores, the hydralisk is noted as being one of the most fierce and sadistic of the zerg strains. Hydralisks are a versatile combat strain, and form the backbone of the Swarm, acting as shock troops. To terrans, hydralisks symbolize the Swarm's power more than any other strain.Physiology  Hydralisks are covered in armored plates. The average hydralisk in 2499 was 5.4m long, 2.1-3.5m tall, and weighed anything from 390 kg to 3500kg. At \"cruising speed,\" they could move from 13-24 kph. The hydralisks of this era were smaller and leaner than the creatures that would follow them, which also possess tri-bladed scythes instead of the single ones used by the hydralisks of the Great War and Brood War. Despite their relatively sluggish nature, hydralisks can climb vertical surfaces and continued evolution of the strain through muscular augmentation through genetic manipulation has resulted in faster hydralisks, increasing their locomotion by up to 25%, both on and off creep. Hydralisks muscles and tendons are strong and impenetrable by a number of weapons, but have the flexibility of leather.Dominion Intelligence Section published reports that hydralisks had a weak spot in their head, though many marines attest to such a weak spot being the creature's chest. The hydralisk's endocrine and adrenal were altered as part of their evolution. The chemicals pumped into their bloodstream effectively force them to live in a perpetual \"fight response.\" Some hydralisk variants seem to be able to overcharge their specialized endocrine system, substantially increasing aggression and savagery. As the backbone of the Swarm, hydralisks are subject to constant evolutionary improvement. Prior to the beginning of the Brood War, hydralisks gained the ability to mutate into lurkers. Hydralisks changed drastically in the transition to the Second Great War, and evolved more bone claws as well as a bulkier figure. During the Second Great War, the ability of hydralisks to metamorphose into lurkers was temporarily lost. The Leviathan Brood was the exception, due to the inherent link between hydralisks and lurkers within the brood. After the End War, some hydralisks were given the essence of the noxious strain of ultralisks, giving them new toxic abilities and changing their appearance. By the Battle of Adena, the hydralisks of the Niadra Brood possessed a different physique from their Swarm counterparts, being longer, slimmer, and possessing shorter, less curved scythes. They fired their spikes from their hands rather than their upper carapace plates.Tactics  Since hydralisks move relatively slowly over open terrain, it is common for hydralisks to burrow and await their prey to enter killing range before attacking, destroying their enemies in a deadly crossfire. Current terran tactics for dealing with the creatures stress the need for siege tank support, and are only to be approached by trained soldiers. Hydralisks are sometimes supported by infestors.Attacks  Hydralisks may attack directly with tri-bladed scythes Grown from the relatively soft ribs of the slothien, they were hardened through genetic manipulation. The high-density bone blades are connected to a set of fast-twitching, striated muscles, which allow for great striking power with a modest range of motion, deadly even in restricted mobility scenarios such as tight corridors or trenches. More commonly though, hydralisks strike from a distance with volleys of armor-piercing spines, 30cm in length, and is their deadlier form of attack. Hundreds of these spines are stored in the upper carapace plates and covered by flaps. The flaps fold back before the spines fire, and the hydralisk's head is dipped beforehand. These physical signs give a hydralisk's foes a few seconds warning before they launch their volley. The hydralisk has 4,000 muscles, compared to a terran's 629, and a portion of these may be used to launch the spines with enough force to penetrate 2 cm. of neosteel at a range of over 300 meters or even half a kilometer at a velocity greater than that of the C-20A rifle, moving at near hypersonic speeds. The spines were evolved from the slothien's defensive urticating hairs; they may be \"grooved\" for increased range and are highly poisonous. The hydralisk may also use its jaw as a weapon. With an estimated bite force of 5000 pounds per square inch, the hydralisk's jaw can easily cut through flesh, bone, and even neosteel. Hydralisks have also demonstrated the ability to spread a webbing that encases and constricts a target, allowing them to be restrained and transported for infestation.History  The first recorded encounter between terrans and hydralisks was aboard a cargo vessel. The hydralisk was recorded by the derelict ship's security cameras. Since then, hydralisks have established themselves in terran culture to a notable extent. Sometimes colloquially called \"hydras,\" hydralisk skulls have been mounted akin to trophies in Joeyray's Bar and on an ore loader on Sorona. The Annual Hydralisk Derby has also become an established event. Project Tamed was a Dominion project that attempted to use controlled hydralisks as living weapons, but it backfired, as the control was feigned, and they had in actual fact never been removed from the control of the Queen of Blades.Game Unit StarCraft: Ghost  Hydralisks were featured as a player unit in StarCraft: Ghost, in addition to acting as enemies. Hydralisks maintained their StarCraft abilities but also gained a powerful claw attack. Their poison quill attack interfered with terran vision. They moved more slowly than zerglings. In Invasion mode, transforming a zergling into a hydralisk cost one point.Heroes of the Storm  The Hunter Killer strain of hydralisk can be summoned by Zagara in Heroes of the Storm. Hydralisks can be spawned on the map Braxis Holdout, and are part of the zerg attack waves that are sent against opponents.Warcraft III  The hydralisk appears as an Easter egg unit in Warcraft III and its expansion, The Frozen Throne.Diablo III  A hydralisk skull can be found in the second and fifth acts of Diablo III.Known Hydralisks Variant Strains Evolutions Individuals Notes Merchandise Ultralisk  The ultralisk is a zerg heavy ground unit.Overview  Ultralisks are the most powerful ground strain the Swarm possesses and their DNA is the \"final viable code\" utilized by larvae. Living battering rams, ultralisks serve as the backbone of the Swarm, and serve as its siegebreaker. When dealing with these creatures, Dominion marines are advised to maintain a wide perimeter and call in air support.Physiology Attacks  Fast for their size, ultralisks attack using large, bone-like scythes which protrude from their backs. Known as \"kaiser blades\", these scythes are nearly indestructible. Possessing monomolecular edges, these scythes are able to tear through most substances with ease, able to slice through armored vehicle and eviscerate entire squads of light infantry in just a few swipes. The density, bevel, and edges of these organic weapons are honed at the genetic level. By 2500 at least some ultralisks sported four kaiser blades as opposed to the usual two. By the Second Great War, four blades were the standard. The ultralisk's size in of itself is also a weapon\u2014they can charge with enough ferocity to even destroy protoss force fields.Defenses  Ultralisks possess an exceptionally thick carapace.Dominion scientists suspect that the larva's highly resistant carapace served as a template for enhancements to the creature. Preliminary tests on the carapace itself proved that the diamond-shaped, chitinous scales of the creature were combined with foreign compounds and organic tissue multiple times, resulting in very light plates with an unmatched level of hardness. A gene also exists within the ultralisk's genetic code that exists with the sole purpose of growing heavily armored copies of the beast\u2019s primary organs in random locations of its body. The brontolith's immune system was improved on for the ultralisk, allowing it to thrive in the most toxic and inhospitable environments the galaxy has to offer. The ultralisk's weak spots are located in its head (particuarly the mouth and eyes), and its underbelly. By the Brood War, prolonged exposure to vespene gas had resulted in an enhancement to the ultralisks' physical capabilities, among which was the evolution of a more hardened exoskeletal shell and the ability to carry out anabolic synthesis, alterations being made to the glands that produce endorphins and adrenal fluids. By the Second Great War, the strain had received substantial additions to its internal structure\u2014a complex sensory system, an auxiliary nervous system, and specialized muscle fibers that expand or contract in reaction to stimuli. Through this, an ultralisk can maintain speed even with its hind legs severed. During the Second Great War, some ultralisks were combined with the\u00a0essence of\u00a0Zerus's\u00a0primal zerg, making them truly unstoppable killing machines. Ultralisks birthed by the Leviathan Brood are terrifying vistages of spines and blades, monsters worthy of legend.History  Ultralisks evolved from the docile brontolith; a creature that the ultralisk now bears little resemblance to. The brontoliths' genetic code was dissected, rebuilt and repurposed multiple times. Each phase of the process served to eliminate less desirable traits, as well as augment the creature\u2019s ability to withstand severe punishment. This included the creature's superb immune system. As a finishing touch to the ultralisk, the Swarm added the gene that would replace the creature's organs. When terrans first encountered ultralisks on the battlefield, they observed that the creatures seemed to suffer balance issues, and were easily toppled by artillery fire or loss of limbs. By the Second Great War, \"unstoppable\" ultralisks had been observed. The additions to their internal structure were revealed, but the data offered very little in the way of finding a counter to the creature. Second Great War ultralisks were also noted to have a greater amount of Kaiser blades, as well as a higher amount of carapace armor. Ultralisks have been submitted to countless genetic experiments. Ultralisks have been studied by terrans to a significant extent, Avernus Station and the Castanar space platform serving as examples. During the final stages of the Second Great War, Sarah Kerrigan was able to reconstitute the Ultralisk strain from test subjects at the Skygeirr Platform laboratory. Research stations in Korhal allowed Kerrigan to also assimilate the Noxious strain of ultralisk, as well as reconstitute the Torrasque strain.Other Information  The ultralisk is 20 meters long and 5 meters tall.Game Unit StarCraft: Ghost  Ultralisks appeared in StarCraft: GhostDiablo III  An ultralisk skull can be spotted in the background of the first act of Diablo III, in the Ancient Pyre, an area that sometimes appear within the Southern Highlands.Heroes of the Storm  Kerrigan can summon an Ultralisk in Heroes of the Storm. Ultralisks can be spawned on the map Braxis Holdout, and are part of the zerg attack waves that are sent against opponents. An ultralisk skin is available for The Butcher.Known Ultralisks Variant Strains Individuals Trivia Samir Duran  \"Samir Duran\" and \"Emil Narud\" are but two of the many names used over the millennia by a xel'naga in service to Amon. Millennia after the fall of his master Amon, Duran manipulated the conflict between the terran, protoss, and zerg in order to bring about his master's return and the creation of the hybrid. Duran took many guises and roles throughout the conflict, including a member of the Confederate Resistance Forces, an advisor in the United Earth Directorate, an infested terran consort to Sarah Kerrigan, head of the Moebius Foundation and the Terran Dominion Hybrid Breeding Program, and finally a xel'naga and jailer to Ouros. All these roles were used to manipulate events to bring about Amon's return.Biography  Duran/Narud was the devoted servant of Amon, trying to resurrect him for millennia after his master died.Confederate Warrior  Duran claimed to have served in Alpha Squadron before Arcturus Mengsk brought down the Terran Confederacy. Duran, sensing a shift in the power structure, assumed command of a small commando squad called the Confederate Resistance Forces that was dedicated to striking at Mengsk and his new Terran Dominion.The Brood War  As Duran, the xel'naga claimed to be thirty-three years old during the Brood War.A Meeting on Braxis  When the United Earth Directorate launched its first attack against the Dominion on Braxis, Duran monitored the attack before offering his services to Vice Admiral Alexei Stukov. Stukov accepted, but only because both men had the same enemy. Even though Duran had the potential to be a valuable asset, Stukov was nevertheless suspicious. However, Duran won him over, and provided the UED with a route to the 'back door' of Boralis, aiding the invaders in capturing the planet's capital. The UED gained access to confidential Dominion information from Braxis. Duran used the information to plan an assassination attempt on Arcturus Mengsk, who was visiting Umoja at the time. He did not take part in the operation as he was required to journey to Dylar IV for the UED's attack on the Dylarian Shipyards. Instead, the failed assassination mission was led by Captain Angelina Emillian \u2013 Mengsk's former instructor.Special Advisor to the UED  The UED sought to steal Dominion battlecruisers dry-docked at the Dylarian Shipyards. During operational planning, Duran warned DuGalle that the Dominion could reinforce its outlying bases within sixteen hours. The stolen battlecruiser fleet was ready in time to defeat Dominion reinforcements led by General Edmund Duke. Duran accompanied the UED fleet to Tarsonis. His research team located the psi disrupter, a lost Confederate weapon capable of disrupting zerg communication. Duran advised that it be destroyed, and DuGalle concurred; if it was captured by the Dominion, it would jeopardize the UED's plan to enslave the Second Overmind. Stukov's dissenting opinion, to use the disrupter against the zerg, was overruled. As Duran had shown such concern over the matter, DuGalle ordered him to personally secure the disrupter. Duran's strategy of destroying surrounding hives to render surrounding the zerg dormant was successful. Duran's preparations to demolish the disrupter were interrupted by the intervention of Stukov's ghosts, who had orders to relieve Duran and take over the weapon's disassembly. Duran did not challenge them. Duran participated in planning the UED assault on Korhal, the Dominion throne world. He suggested destroying a large cluster of missile silos on the outskirts of Augustgrad, the capital city, to disable the defender's core nuclear capabilities. The UED subsequently captured Augustgrad. Mengsk escaped capture with the aid of Raynor's Raiders and a small protoss fleet.The Turncoat  The UED pursued Mengsk and his rescuers to Aiur, where the fugitives prepared to escape through the warp gate. The UED's quarry were entrenched in a large protoss base, surrounded by nesting, but apparently passive, zerg. While one UED force struck for the gate and the fugitives, Stukov and Duran were assigned to guard the flanks and prevent potential interference by the zerg. As the main attack neared its objective, the warp gate activated and incited the zerg. Duran's forces were out of position as a large zerg force swept in from the northeast. He claimed not to detect the enemy force, and claimed communications difficulties prevented him from receiving Stukov's frantic warnings. The ensuing chaos allowed Mengsk and Commander Jim Raynor to escape through the gate in a dropship. The gate subsequently self-destructed. Stukov took an unauthorized leave of absence to Braxis as the operation on Aiur concluded. DuGalle and Duran tracked him there and found the vice-admiral had secretly had the psi disrupter reassembled, in contravention of previous orders. Duran convinced DuGalle that Stukov was acting treacherously, and was authorized by the aggrieved admiral to find and execute the vice admiral. Duran and a marine strike force entered the disruptor and broke through the Stukov's Elite Guard to confront Stukov. Duran shot Stukov and disappeared to activate the disruptor's self-destruct. A dying Stukov convinced DuGalle that the psi disruptor was critical to defeating the zerg and that Duran was the real traitor, and possibly infested. So alerted, the UED quickly shut down the self-destruct.Infestation  Duran escaped to join the zerg. The UED used the disrupter to severely weaken the zerg and claim the second Overmind on Char. As the UED claimed victory, Duran appeared to introduce DuGalle to Sarah Kerrigan. After some verbal sparring with DuGalle, the two departed, as a swarm of mutalisks covered their retreat from the UED forces. Kerrigan and Duran traveled to Tarsonis, where Duran interrupted a conversation between her, Raynor, and Fenix to inform Kerrigan that the psi disrupter's signal had reached them on Tarsonis and shattered the unity of her broods. Aboard the Hyperion, in orbit around Moria, Duran and Kerrigan discussed whether Raynor, Fenix, and Mengsk suspected them of anything. Kerrigan said they must suspect something, but preferred working with her rather than with the UED. The Swarm traveled to Korhal and assaulted the UED forces there along with Raynor's Raiders and Fenix's troops. After the main UED base was destroyed, Kerrigan decided to eradicate her allies. Duran suggested the strategy of attacking while her allies were resting, allowing them to whittle down their defenses with relative ease. The ploy was successful. After the destruction of Duke's and Fenix's bases, they returned to Tarsonis to rest. Two days later, the UED, intent on forcing Kerrigan's hand, tested out their control of the Overmind by sending hundreds of zerg to Tarsonis. As they began attacking their outposts, Duran informed her of the situation and rallied her forces. Kerrigan's forces secured their perimeter when Duran noticed a small UED encampment which protected a number of scientists. Kerrigan said the \"scientists\" were helping the UED command these Renegade Zerg at such a great distance from the Overmind; they had to be eliminated. Kerrigan's zerg took the fight to the UED Slave Brood hive clusters and the scientists, destroying them. Duran then accompanied Kerrigan to Shakuras to kidnap Raszagal. Kerrigan did not reveal her interest in Raszagal to Duran, however. Duran informed her that the pylon clusters were generating some sort of electromagnetic field that prevented their flyers from maneuvering. Duran suggested staging a diversion and claiming Raszagal during the confusion, namely causing a surge within the pylon clusters adjacent to the outpost of Talematros, causing its power grids to overload. The resulting explosion will be the perfect cover for retrieving Raszagal. Kerrigan agreed, calling Duran's scheme \"Clean, simple, devious.\" A cerebrate provided cover for Duran as he infiltrated the pylon clusters, set the charges, and ignited them. Duran soon discovered that Raszagal was captured so as to provide Dark Prelate Zeratul and his brethren the incentive to kill the new Overmind for them. After this was done, Duran informed Kerrigan that with the Overmind and its cerebrates destroyed, all of the zerg in the sector had reverted to her direct control. In addition, the remnants of the UED fleet had fled the planet (although he had no idea how many functional ships they still possessed), and the zerg had finished relocating Kerrigan's primary hive clusters to Char Aleph. However, Zeratul and his brethren were able to bypass their defenses and steal Raszagal away from them. They had regrouped with a number of protoss survivors on the surface of Char and would be capable of dimensional recall to Shakuras within thirty minutes. Kerrigan had all of her broods mobilized and sent to the surface of Char. During this time, Duran had disappeared.The Mystery Deepens  Duran traveled to a dark moon where he and a team of Clandestine Mercenaries worked on a protoss/zerg hybridization project at the behest of a \"far greater power\". Duran would refer to the hybrid as the \"completion of a cycle, a reference to the life cycle of the xel'naga, in which the long-lived but not immortal race would regenerate itself by modifying two species with purity of form and essence to naturally over eons evolve into a new incarnation of the xel'naga. According to the preserver Zamara, however, Samir Duran's experiments are a \"perversion\", and if his attempts \"unify\" the species become successful, it will result in \"a monstrous and powerful perversion of both protoss and zerg will be set loose upon the universe, and all that [the protoss and terran] know and cherish will fall in their wake\". Zeratul discovered the project when investigating the source of protoss energy signatures on the dark moon. Duran himself uncloaked in front of a stasis cell holding a successful specimen and spoke to Zeratul. From the manner in which Duran replied to Zeratul, claiming to be many millennia old (and having had many names over these millennia) and serving \"a far greater power\", Duran's background became even more enigmatic. Duran, referring to the hybrid, said it was a \"completion of a cycle. Its role in the cosmic order was preordained when the stars were young\".Interbellum  During the years after the Brood War, Kerrigan learned something of Duran's activities. His position as consort was briefly taken by Ethan Stewart.Creating Monsters  Prior to the Second Great War, the xel'naga, calling himself Dr. Emil Narud, was made the head of the Dominion's Hybrid Breeding Program, combining protoss and zerg DNA to create alien supersoldiers. Technology was utilized that was well beyond the scope of terran capabilities. Narud built Skygeirr Station on top of a xel'naga temple. There, more hybrids were created with Dominion support. Narud devised a plan to modify a xel'naga relic named the Keystone that could convert the zerg mutagen in Sarah Kerrigan and her Swarms into energy, providing enough power to resurrect Amon.Crafting Enemies  Alexei Stukov was infested and reanimated, and eventually deinfested and rescued by Jim Raynor and the protoss. Stukov held Narud responsible for his infestation, which was spun on a micro scale not possible for the zerg. Stukov's deinfestation eventually failed, and he was imprisoned and experimented on by Narud and the Dominion at Skygeirr Station. During the Second Great War, Stukov escaped and contacted Sarah Kerrigan, his former enemy, seeking revenge.The Good Doctor  Narud made friends with Valerian Mengsk, an aspiring archaeologist and Heir Apparent to the Terran Dominion. Valerian became convinced that Narud was a genius about the zerg and the xel'naga, the latter a subject of keen interest to Valerian. Together they founded the Moebius Foundation. Narud was viewed as an expert on protoss/xel'naga technology. The two designed Space Station Prometheus, a secret research laboratory in the difficult-to-navigate Kirkegaard Belt. While there, Narud worked on hybridization experiments. He let Valerian know about them, but not about how far they had progressed.The Second Great War  Narud's Moebius Foundation hired Tychus Findlay and Jim Raynor to recover the xel'naga device. This was in contravention to an official Dominion ban on the trade of alien artifacts. As Raynor's Raiders continued to pick up pieces of the artifact, they clashed with Sarah Kerrigan's Zerg Swarm and the Tal'darim who were holding most of the pieces. While affiliated with the Tal'darim, he did not inform them that the artifact was essential to his plans to revive Amon.The Moebius Factor  When Kerrigan attacked the Foundation's main research campus on Tyrador VIII, Narud sent three Moebius Security teams to purge the Foundation's data cores. When none of them reported back, he asked Commander Jim Raynor to destroy the cores. He warned that if Kerrigan found them and discovered the coordinates of the remaining pieces of the xel'naga artifact, the fate of the entire Koprulu sector could hang in the balance. He gave Raynor control of the Foundation's medivac dropships to transport his men around the city and avoid most of the zerg. Kerrigan claimed that she saw through Narud's \"pathetic charade.\" Once it was confirmed that the final data core had been destroyed, Narud ordered an evacuation and told Raynor why Kerrigan wanted the artifacts: she feared the power of the xel'naga. In a statement, Narud credited Raynor's Raiders with keeping Kerrigan from achieving her goal. He was unavailable for comment when the Universal News Network broadcast its report on his run-in with Kerrigan.Flashpoint  The first phase of the war ended with Kerrigan's defeat and de-infestation at Char due to the device's effects.Hybrid located nearby collected the energy which could be later used to resurrect Amon. Seeking to keep Kerrigan out of the reach of Arcturus Mengsk, Raynor and Valerian Mengsk fled to Deadman's Rock in the battlecruisers Hyperion and Bucephalus. Both vessels had taken significant damage. On the way there, the rebels decided to take Kerrigan to see Dr. Narud, due to his reputation as a zerg expert, as well as his expertise about the xel'naga artifact. Dr. Narud appeared at a meeting with the rebels there. When he wanted to begin examining Kerrigan, Raynor told him that Kerrigan was refusing to be examined. They were interrupted when criminals tried to capture them. Dr. Narud pulled a small pistol. During the battle, rebel commander Matt Horner was injured. Dr. Narud helped treat him. Dr. Narud and the rebels took Kerrigan to Space Station Prometheus, where Narud was situated. Along the way, his repeated attempts to examine Kerrigan and hide information about the space station annoyed the rebels. Valerian Mengsk even told Narud that he wasn't popular in his sickbay or bridge. In addition, Kerrigan believed his psionic resonance was familiar, but didn't recognize Narud, causing her to wonder if he was disguised. A frustrated Narud ordered a hostile reception for the rebels, but Valerian talked him down. Kerrigan went to the station's sickbay, where her blood was tested but nothing else was done to her. The xel'naga artifact was also brought the station, where Dr. Narud examined it. Narud assigned repair teams to their ships and invited the pair to dinner, although these teams were really out to sabotage the vessels. In addition, he had Dr. Chantal de Vries \"persuade\" rebel scientist Egon Stetmann to visit his laboratories, but it simply enabled Narud's men to capture him. He invited Raynor and Valerian to a dinner meeting, where he questioned Raynor so thoroughly the latter felt annoyed, as if he were being interrogated. The dinner turned into an ambush, as Narud was revealed to be in contact with Arcturus. In the resulting skirmish, Narud cloaked and fled. The ambush failed in a sense, in that Kerrigan and her protectors were able to escape Mengsk's grasp and rescue Stetmann, even when Narud released a trio of his hybrids against them. Narud took the artifact to the station's loading bay and put it aboard a warp-transport when Raynor, Valerian, Stetmann and Kerrigan arrived there. One of the hybrids was present, along with many of Narud's troops, and during the battle Narud abandoned the station with the artifact. At the last minute, the Raiders dropship Fanfare, newly armed, arrived. It fired on Narud's transport, but he managed to escape. Narud would go on to resurrect Amon at Atrias, a Tal'darim-guarded world.Heart of the Swarm  In the final stages of the Second Great War, Kerrigan led the Swarm against Skygeirr, having been requested there by an escaped Alexei Stukov. When she entered Narud's lab and killed one of his hybrid dominators, Narud told her she was not welcome there. He then proceeded to awaken seven other hybrids, telling them to fulfill their purpose and kill everything. He prattled that the Swarm had served its purpose and was a broken tool fit only for the scrap heap. He asked Kerrigan if she could feel the hybrid's hatred coursing through her mind. Although Narud was surprised that Kerrigan managed to kill several of his hybrid, he told her that she still had no hope. Narud held his best troops, the Tal'darim, in reserve in the depths of the station. When Kerrigan breached the sanctum, Narud drove a null zone beam towards her, which she tried to hold back with a beam of her own. He ordered the Tal'darim to destroy the zerg hive, and unleashed numerous hybrid to support the Tal'darim. Narud's strength began to slip as Stukov deactivated the five temples that were amplifying his power. The null zone left him weakened and vulnerable. As Kerrigan entered Amon's temple, Narud caught her off guard by appearing as Raynor. In the middle of their fight, Narud changed his appearance to that of Kerrigan's human form and impaled her on a psi blade. In response, Kerrigan fatally wounded Narud with her wings. With his dying breath, Narud revealed that Amon was alive and that she would see him soon.Into the Void  After Skygeirr, Narud returned to the Void, where he served as the jailer of the xel'naga Ouros. Later, when Kerrigan, Raynor, Stukov, and Hierarch Artanis led a joint invasion into the Void to seek out and destroy Amon, they came upon Narud. Despite resistance from void shades and thrashers, the allied forces pushed through Narud's defenses and cornered him. Stukov stepped forward and asked Narud if he remembered him, calling him \"Duran\". When Narud assumed that Stukov was there to gloat, Stukov simply said, \"No. I've come to say goodnight, you son of a bitch.\" He then destroyed Narud/Duran with a psychic blast, finally exacting revenge for their confrontation on Braxis six years ago. This time, Narud's death was permanent.Game Unit StarCraft  Duran appears in StarCraft: Brood War missions as a ghost hero unit.StarCraft II  Narud appears in all three installments of StarCraft II.Heroes of the Storm  Lines exist for Duran in Heroes of the Storm data.Personality and Traits  Duran considered himself superior to other beings as he manipulated them to his own ends. He has let this condescension shine through when not masking his own nature. This low opinion of other lifeforms extended to the zerg as a whole, regarding them as \"a broken tool, fit only for the scrap heap.\" As Duran he spoke with a \"liquid\" accent and favored the C-10 rifle in combat. While masquerading as an adviser to DuGalle and later Kerrigan, Duran presented the facade of being dutiful and loyal, frequently offering information and suggests for plans of attack. His knowledge of tactics made him invaluable in the campaigns of both commanders. As Narud, he was also apt at displaying earnest humility to those around him when he needed to. Few were aware of Duran's true nature before his demise in the Void. Sarah Kerrigan was unaware of who or what he was until shortly before the Second Great War. Zeratul only became suspicious after personally meeting Duran at the end of the Brood War. None of his former Confederate Resistance Forces comrades would have believed the truth.Abilities  Duran was a powerful and vastly intelligent being. He was knowledgeable about the zerg, and protoss technology. He was powerful enough to generate a null zone, survive being hit by it, generate psionic bolts, and survive all manner of psionic and physical attacks before finally succumbing to his injuries at the hands of Kerrigan, only to later have survived and retreat to the void. He also demonstrated the ability to generate a psi-blade without any apparent technological device to focus the energy. He also possessed shapeshifting abilities.Notes Immortal  The immortal is a protoss cybernetic war machine.Overview  Immortals stem from dragoons. Their pilots live in a sterile nutrient solution saturated with microscopic machines, which helps preserve their mangled bodies. The machines repair aging tissue, destroy any foreign matter that might penetrate the cockpit (usually due to hull breaches) and regulate the pilot\u2019s heart rate, brain activity, and biological functions. Immortals are some of the most advanced hardware ever devised by the protoss. Upon transplantation, immortals are consecrated in the name of Adun, as he was the one who best understood the meaning of self-sacrifice.Design  Immortals stand over twice as tall as a terran wearing CMC armor. They are outfitted with two twin phase disruptors as their primary attack form; they give critical fire support to legions of zealots against ground targets, deployed when the protoss are faced with heavy enemy firepower. These blasts can easily punch large holes in heavy plating, but their limited field of fire prevents Immortals from engaging aerial targets. When deployed, immortals give critical support by eliminating enemy artillery and ranged attackers. Immortals are equipped with armor weave that mitigates impacts through energy dissipation. Additionally, the hardened shields used by immortals are created by intertwining spectrums and wavelengths of varying intensity. Through this, these shields are incredibly dense, able to mitigate powerful impacts such as siege tank rounds or the blades of an ultralisk, through energy dissipation. When the remaining dragoons were turned into immortals, the protoss decided to outfit them with these shields in an attempt to further preserve their most ancient and venerable warriors. Originally, the shields only activated when struck by powerful attacks, which left immortals more vulnerable to the pinprick attacks of lesser foes. By 2505, immortal shields were heavily reinforced, making the immortal invulnerable to enemy attack for short periods of time. These shields were impractical for mass production.History  Historically, crippled veteran Templar could volunteer to continue serving by being transplanted into dragoon exoskeletons. This honored tradition was broken by the fall of Aiur when the shrine dedicated to dragoon creation was infested by the zerg. Following the Brood War, crippled templar were transplanted into the new immortal exoskeletons instead. The first were in service by 2502. The remaining dragoons were transformed into immortals. As a result, immortals house some of the most skilled and venerable warriors of the protoss military. Ultimately, immortals are a dying breed. Soon, none will remain. By 2506, only the most revered heroes of the Templar were allowed to become immortals, due to the resources required to produce them. In the aftermath of the End War, Purifiers began to re-purpose the shells of fallen immortals into fully automated combat walkers. After the End War, some fallen templar elected to use ancient exoskeletons to show their dedication to ideals that united the protoss in their times of trouble.Game Unit  Immortals dropped by warp prisms may conduct raids against enemy structures and expansions. Immortals are a good counter against roaches and ravagers. If a zerg player is using these units in excess, immortals can be considered a core unit.Wings of Liberty  Immortals are usable in the StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty protoss mini-campaign, available during and after the \"A Sinister Turn\" mission.Legacy of the Void  In the single-player campaign, the player may choose between the immortal, the annihilator, and the vanguard for their robotic walker unit. The vanguard has superior attack power and the annihilator has a heavy-damage shadow cannon ability, while the base immortal has its Barrier ability for superior durability and tanking abilities. The hardened shield trait is removed, replaced by a barrier ability. In the campaign, the barrier initially absorbs only 100 damage, but lasts 10 seconds. Later, after \"Brothers in Arms\", barriers can absorb up to 200 damage. This makes the immortal the toughest of the three variants with an effective total health of 500 and the second toughest unit the protoss can field, only beaten by a mothership, and their hardened shields allow them to take on heavy terran armor such as siege tanks without trouble. However, note that the immortal has to survive the hit that finishes their normal shields to activate the barrier; if they take a single hit strong enough to burn through the rest of their shields and their full health the barrier will not activate in time, and they will be destroyed.Co-op Missions  Artanis, Karax, and Fenix can build immortals in Co-op Missions. Artanis is able to upgrade his immortals from the start, while Karax unlocks immortal upgrades at Level 9. Fenix unlocks the ability for his immortals be controlled by Taldarin at Level 5, allowing one of them to pull targets together and the researchable ability to store damage within a target that explodes out to surrounding enemies upon death. Alarak can utilize the vanguard immortal variant. Zeratul can utilize a variant of the immortal named the xel'naga enforcer.Development  The immortal carried the \"thematic spirit\" of the dragoon from the original game from a development standpoint. From a gameplay standpoint, immortals were conceived to act as \"meat shields,\" as per its hardened shields acting as a counter to siege tanks. However, it was found that players used them more aggressively than initially conceived. The immortal's barrier ability was temporarily removed during development. It received a buff during the Legacy of the Void beta in order to encourage warp prism drops. The barrier originally gave the immortal 200 HP.Known Immortals Variants Trivia Terran  The terrans (or humans) are a young species with psionic potential. The terrans of the Koprulu sector descend from the survivors of a disastrous 23rd century colonization mission from Earth. Compared to the protoss and zerg, the terrans are highly factionalized and endure frequent wars amongst themselves in addition to the more recent conflicts with their alien neighbors. Nevertheless, terrans stand as one of the three dominant species of the galaxy.Namesake  The term terran generally refers to the humans descending from the survivors of the \"Long Sleep\" and consequently to the human inhabitants of the Koprulu Sector. The term may be used synonymously with human and terrans of the sector may extend its meaning to encompass those not descending from the \"Long Sleep\". Humans of the Earth-based United Earth Directorate refer to themselves as humans, mankind or humanity, although they are sometimes referred to as terrans by Blizzard Entertainment.History  The terrans arrived in the Koprulu sector via supercarriers in 2259, landing on three separate planets \u2013 Tarsonis, Moria and Umoja. They were cut off from Earth. The terran colonists had access to stores of fertilized eggs and frozen embryos, and even extensive cloning, using technologies found on the supercarriers. The terran population expanded rapidly for at least three generations, and for the first five or six generations there was pressure to have many children. Eventually the supercarrier technology broke down. Prior to the Great War, the terrans were primarily divided into three factions in the Koprulu sector, each based on one of the original settled planets \u2013 the Terran Confederacy, Kel-Morian Combine and Umojan Protectorate. The Confederacy was the strongest faction. During the Great War, the Terran Confederacy, experimenting with psi emitter technology, bore the brunt of attacks by the zerg (infested planets were frequently purified by the protoss) while facing the Sons of Korhal. The Sons of Korhal eventually destroyed the Confederacy by using stolen psi emitters to lure the zerg to Tarsonis; the rebels created the Terran Dominion, based on Korhal, to replace the Confederacy. Unknown to the terrans of the Koprulu sector, the humans of Earth were aware of their existence. However, no interference came from Earth until the discovery of the alien invaders, sparking panic. The new Earth government, the United Earth Directorate, dispatched an Expeditionary Fleet to take control of the sector and defeat the aliens. After approximately six months of stability, the Dominion came under attack by the UED. Ultimately the sector escaped UED control, but it left the Dominion weak and with the zerg as the sector's dominant power. By the Second Great War, the Dominion was the strongest terran force in the Koprulu Sector, vying with the Kel-Morian Combine and the Umojan Protectorate for influence. On the eve of war, Raynor's Raiders resumed its anti-Dominion campaign after a period of relative inactivity. The terran polities were engulfed at the start of the Second Great War by a massive zerg invasion. Sarah Kerrigan's objective was the recovery of the Keystone, and the invasion was a way of searching for it. Billions of terrans were killed. Ultimately, the terrans survived the conflict, but at great damage to the Dominion, and the loss of Emperor Mengsk.Physiology  The average terran is 1.8m tall. Maximum human life expectancy is at least 150 years, without any mental degradation, though few terrans live over a century and terrans over the age of 80 are still considered old. Blonde hair and blue eyes still occur naturally in terrans though these traits (and others) can be altered by gene therapy and/or augmentic surgery. This can lead to a certain uniformity of appearance for those wealthy enough to afford such treatments.Abathur considers the terrans to be a doomed species due to their lack of genetic diversity and the proliferation of recessive traits in their gene pool. Physically, terrans are inferior to species such as the zerg and protoss. However, terrans are known for their tenacity and ability to adapt to harsh circumstances. In addition, terrans are only a few steps away from developing into a formidable psionic power. Terrans are a suspicious species by nature, and their inner thoughts rarely correspond to how they present themselves to others. Parts of the human brain give predisposition to ritual behavior. Terran brains are adept at seeing patterns, even if they aren't there. Advancements in terran medical technology has removed many issues terrans faced during their development. Cybernetic implants and advanced surgeries have allowed for quicker recovery from injuries that would be permanent or fatal hundreds of years prior. Terrans often make use of medical nanomachines in order to heal injuries, both on the battlefield and in civilian infirmaries.Retinor has eliminated the need for corrective eyewear, though some still wear glasses. Cosmetic surgery is widespread and common among many wealthy terrans. However, issues such as cancer still plagued humanity, some cancers being still inoperable. Some genetic distinction exists between the terrans of the Koprulu sector and their Earth-born counterparts, due to the former's genetically aberrant ancestry.Culture  Terrans are an ingenious and industrious species. It can be said that for terrans, honor is less important than getting results. Before the founding of the United Powers League, terrans possessed a diversity of beliefs; beliefs that were subsequently repressed. This remained true with the Terran Confederacy, which had limited tolerance for \"other faiths\". However, a few planets in the Koprulu Sector, notably the Fringe Worlds, have resurrected old Earth religions, Christianity among them, in addition to creating cults, the Church of Besainted Pelagius being one example. For more agnostic societies, some terrans still believe in the existence of a monotheistic deity, though others are distinctively skeptical. Despite fragments of Earth's history being absent from terran records, some ancient mythologies are still remembered. These include tales of various afterlifes and their dark alternatives, including Hell, Tartarus and Sheol. \"Warrior women\" are remembered from at least one mythology and elements of Greek mythology have been retained also. At least in the Koprulu sector, terran cuisine is highly varied. Many terrans pursue consumerism. Both protoss and zerg individuals have noted that terrans are a species driven by greed. One belief, or rather hope that has remained more-or-less constant for humanity is a fascination with the existence of other sapient life \u2013 a hope that remained unfulfilled until contact was made with the protoss and zerg. The leaders of the United Powers League were of a different mindset than their Koprulu counterparts, demonstrating a purely militaristic and xenophobic approach to the discovery of alien species. If one takes an outsider's view on humanity, (e.g. a protoss's), then humanity possesses a wide, puzzling spectrum of morality. When compared to the elder species, terrans are far more obsessed with the notion of private thought and personal freedom and are \"not meant for\" the unity the Khala brings. Having experienced it however, a terran ghost theorized humans could become a better people were they able to share the psionic link. Terrans have displayed disregard for the natural world in a manner anathema to the protoss.Factions  The terrans are a heavily-factionalized species, with many different governments and even more groups trying to overthrow said governments. The three dominant factions in the Koprulu sector are the Kel-Morian Combine, Terran Dominion and the Umojan Protectorate, the Dominion having taken the place of the now defunct Terran Confederacy. Earth and its colonies are controlled by the United Earth Directorate, though this is not absolute. It has been speculated that if ever humanity united under a single banner, it could become an unstoppable force. Many rebel groups sparr(ed) with colonial powers, which have had varying degrees of success in achieving their goals. Hardly a week goes by without there being some military or policing action being reported in the Koprulu Sector. Military cohesiveness within units however, makes terrans a force to be reckoned with.Technology  On the galactic scale, terrans are perhaps a \"middle of the road\" species and something of a paradox technologically. Of the galaxy's sapient species, terrans are significantly inferior to the likes of the protoss yet (seemingly) more advanced than other sapients. From an outsider's point of view, humanity has paradoxically improved its technology despite being in an apparently constant state of conflict. From an insider's point of view, such development has been possible not in spite of conflict, but because of it. Terrans have a vast assortment of weapons and vehicles at their disposal, and they're always trying to create more powerful weapons. Fare gauges, terrain mappers, and targeting systems are standard for terran fightercraft. Their armies possess both adaptability and resilience. Terran technology includes FTL transmission and sensor technology. Terrans have yet to crack quantum computing.Gameplay StarCraft StarCraft: Ghost StarCraft II Notes Development StarCraft: Ghost  StarCraft: Ghost was a tactical action game for video game consoles, announced on September 19, 2002, under development by Blizzard Entertainment and Nihilistic Software. Development later shifted to Swingin' Ape Studios, which Blizzard eventually bought. The game was based in the StarCraft universe. Blizzard, known for computer games, took a step in a different direction by developing it exclusively for the Xbox and PlayStation 2 video game consoles. A GameCube version was also planned, but it was cancelled in November 2005. The development of the primary version of Ghost was infamously delayed and plagued with issues, becoming one of the most famous examples of vaporware. As of 2014, the project has been officially classified as canceled.Gameplay  Ghost's gameplay centered around a single-player campaign, in which the player controlled Nova, a ghost agent. The game was stealth-based, meaning Nova would frequently stealthily approach objectives, using darkness, shadows and cloaking to avoid detection. However, the opponents could sometimes use decloaking devices to detect her. In addition, opponents who couldn't see her would still try to hunt her down if they detected her in some way. The player would need to solve simple puzzles in some parts of the game in order to bypass security \"locks\". For instance, in order to bypass zerg security, Nova must match her psi energy with the system code, and the player must work out color wave patterns to simulate this. Nova was capable of a wide variety of combat moves, including climbing and sliding down ziplines. Nova can use techniques such as \"dangle snipe\" (in which she hangs from a pipe with her legs and snipes an opponent) and also make instant stealth kill attacks in a mini-game in which the player uses different button combinations against different opponents. Nova can even kill an opponent by forcing a grenade into an opponent's helmet and then sealing it shut. In addition, a variety of vehicles played a role in the game, some of which could be directly controlled by the player; Nova could direct other vehicles to strike enemy targets. Nova was typically equipped with an AGR-14 assault rifle and a sniper rifle, but could carry a variety of other weapons and grenades. She sometimes used the psyblade, a melee weapon designed using protoss technology. Nova has powerful psionic abilities, including cloaking, psionic sight (which enables her to see heat signatures through walls) and psionic speed (which quadruples her speed).Multiplayer Modes  In multiplayer mode, players could play (as terrans) light infantry, marines, firebats and ghosts. They could drive or fly vultures, stingers, siege tanks and Grizzlies. As zerg, they could play zerglings, hydralisks, infested marines and mutalisks. Several multiplayer game modes were available, such as Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, King of the Hill and Capture the Base.Mobile Conflict  Capture the Base, also known as Mobile Conflict, involves two teams of up to eight players trying to capture a mobile factory and bring it to their own side using infantry units, which can fight inside it; they would be dropped off using Grizzlies. The battle takes place on Mar Sara.Invasion  Another game mode was Invasion, in which players attempted to take control of resource nodes for points, gaining more powerful units which could be used to destroy the enemy base. Points can be gained for killing enemy units. Taking control of an unoccupied node requires a player unit to remain near the point until a control meter fills up. If the node has already been occupied, the panel controlling it must first be destroyed. The bases are connected by a web of these interconnected nodes. Each node must be captured in turn, which enables dead characters to respawn at a point closer to the front line. This game mode includes a minimap. Players start as the lowest ranking unit on each side; light infantry for terrans and zerglings for the zerg. Gaining access to higher ranking units requires an expenditure of points: a marine costs two points, a firebat costs three and a ghost costs the most at five, while a hydralisk costs one point, an infested marine costs two points and a mutalisk costs the most at five. Respawning takes 0 points. At least one Invasion Mode scenario would take place on Helios over a khaydarin crystal.New and changed units Terrans  Player Units: Player Vehicles: Non-Player Units:Zerg  Player Units: Non-Player Units:Protoss Storyline  Blizzard declared the storyline of the unreleased game non-canon in 2012.Background  The story was supposed to take place four years after the Brood War. However, this appears to have been retconned to 2503. Emperor Arcturus Mengsk has rebuilt much of the Terran Dominion and built up a new military, despite having to worry about the zerg. Smaller factions have been taking this opportunity to seize power while larger factions are otherwise distracted. Mengsk and his new adviser, General Horace Warfield, have begun a secret project codenamed \"Shadow Blade\". The project uses protoss technology. The program uses terrazine gas to alter the genetic makeup of ghosts. These ghosts are transformed into spectres \u2013 shadowy superhuman beings bent on executing the will of their true master. In addition, a Blizzard panel at BlizzCon 2005 revealed that Kerrigan was massing her forces on Char and was strong enough to \"crush the entire sector\", Mengsk rebuilt the Dominion military with robotics and stolen protoss technology and has retaken a number of worlds, while Artanis was trying to merge the two groups of protoss, made more difficult because many Dark Templar hate the protoss who had banished them from Aiur. The main character of the game is Nova, a terran ghost (psionic espionage agent) in the employment of the Terran Dominion squadron, Nova Squadron, working for Colonel Jackson Hauler in his ghost squad. She used to be a member of the Confederate Old Families, but has since undergone a memory wipe. Nova is about to embark upon a perilous mission to uncover the frightening truth behind Project: Shadow Blade \u2013 this conspiracy will cause her to question her own identity while embroiled in a struggle between the Terran Dominion and the rebel Koprulu Liberation Front. She was expected to have to make a choice between her loyalties to Jackson Hauler and to Arcturus Mengsk.Campaign  The opening video shows a group of Terran Dominion marines (and a few firebats) assaulting a zerg-infested \"vespene\" refinery (actually a terrazine refinery) on Mar Sara. Captain Bock leads the group, but is incompetent and refuses to listen to Lieutenant Haggs' suggestion to scout the area first, and when HQ says it will send three dropships with reinforcements, one with a black ops unit, Bock tries to cancel the order. Bock's forces promptly fall into a zerg ambush. He pleads for reinforcements, which arrive in the form of the dropships, one of which is carrying Nova and a black ops team. Two of the dropships are shot down by mutalisks but the third safely lands, disgorging the black ops unit and Nova.Storyline Notes  StarCraft: Ghost \"had a killer plot and a really good bad guy,\" according to Blizzard Entertainment. It was unrelated to the main storyline of StarCraft. Robert Clotworthy was hired to voice act for Jim Raynor in the game. Other characters connected to the major protoss and zerg plotlines were not projected to play a role in the game.Characters of StarCraft: Ghost  Characters Based on Concept Art:\nTerrans ProtossPlanets Visited in StarCraft: Ghost  A protoss starship would also be infiltrated in one mission.Development Origins  Ghost has its origins in the late 90s/early 2000s. The Playstation 2 and Xbox had launched, and in 1998, Blizzard, who desired to enter the console market, had released the original StarCraft to positive reception. It was in this context that the idea for Ghost was pitched to Blizzard by Nihilistic Software. Exactly who came up with the idea for Ghost is unknown, but according to Robert Huebner, Nihilistic had been greatly influenced by the rise of stealth games in the late 90s. They presented their idea to Blizzard, based on the concept of players taking control of a ghost, but as a player on the battlefield rather than from a god's-eye view. A demo was pitched that involved a character in a trench along with zerglings coming overhead. The demo included siege tanks and an air strike. Bill Roper could see Nihilistic's passion for the project, but Blizzard itself had its hands full with its own projects, as in the early 2000s, much of its staff was working on Diablo II. The two companies struck a development deal whereby Nihilistic would contribute the main work on the game and Blizzard would guide development with constant feedback. Blizzard would also provide cinematics. No specific deadline was given to Nihilistic.Course of Development Nihilistic  Nihilistic began development on Ghost in 2001. Nihilistic aimed to release the game for the Xbox, PlayStation 2 and Nintendo GameCube consoles in late 2003. The team put a lot of effort into making the character, and by extension, the player, feel as though they were in control of a ghost. Abilities like cloaking and swift movement would make the player feel like a combat veteran, and the power to call down nukes (as in the original game) would provide a feeling of battlefield domination. The plot in this stage of development underwent numerous revisions, but it was quickly agreed upon that Nova would encounter enemies from all three of the first game's playable races. However, at some point, development began to go awry. Interviews conducted with Nihilistic staff members have demonstrated that this exact point can't be agreed upon, but according to Huebner, trouble began when regular meetings with Blizzard became more about adding new features and experimenting and less about perfecting an established idea. The game's open-ended development timeline allowed for lengthy debates and significant iteration to occur without the team making progress toward a shippable title. When Splinter Cell was released in 2002, Huebner noticed that some of Blizzard's feedback was mirroring the features contained in the game. Metal Gear was likewise an influence. Furthermore, Ghost suffered from a number of producer changes, which meant that no one person at Blizzard was responsible for the entire life of the project. This also made the Nihilistic developers feel as though Blizzard wasn't making Ghost a priority, as large gaps between feedback was occurring. Another change was that while Ghost had started off as a stealth title, Blizzard was demanding more action in the game. The stealth-action spectrum wavered over feedback, and the question of multiplayer was brought up. Nihilistic delivered demos quickly, but this led to very different feedback from Blizzard's \"strike teams\" as the game's style (stealth or action) differed between builds. When James Goddard was hired as a consultant, he pushed the game towards the action end of the spectrum, which, in Huebner's mind, was to the game's detriment. Goddard's appointment, among other decisions, contributed to the cumulative feeling at Nihilistic that no one at Blizzard took the project under their wing. Among team members, there was a collective feeling that Rob Pardo provided much-needed guidance and specific feedback before Goddard came on board, but this didn't last long. During the summer of 2002, the entire Nihilistic Software development team quit en masse. Following the resignations, Blizzard reassured their customers that there was nothing to worry about, that Nihilistic Software had merely finished the job they were hired for, that there were no power struggles inside the company and that the game will be delivered on time. After the 2002 Tokyo Game Show, the art style was changed, a multiplayer mode was implemented, and a team co-op multiplayer was \"being chased.\" However, the game was entering a point where Blizzard was starting to feel that it wasn't shippable, either (in Huebner's view) due to lack of resources or too many decision-makers. A Nihilistic staff member has claimed that the story had undergone numerous rewrites, which exacerbated the development issues. In 2003 and '04, the issues came to a head. No progress was being made, and Nihilistic was looking for a partnership with Electronic Arts. The levels were playable, but felt cobbled together from different games. By 2004, according to David Paul, the game was in a shippable state, but had a lot of missing content. That same year, a meeting occurred between Nihilistic and Blizzard. According to Huebner, both sides felt that production needed to wrap up. At some point afterwards, Nihilistic ceased work on the game.Swingin' Ape  According to Goddard, when Nihilistic ceased work on Ghost, Blizzard considered the project was in good enough shape to hand off to another studio. In July, 2004, Blizzard Entertainment employed Swingin' Ape Studios to work on the game, almost immediately after Nihilistic ceased development. According to sources, when Swingin' Ape took over, development became less stressful, and feedback became more streamlined and consistent. While Nihilistic had introduced some multiplayer elements, there had been pushback due to team members feeling it was moving away from their original vision. With Swingin' Ape, according to Goddard, the multiplayer could be given more attention. Reportedly, Swingin' Ape moved to make the game \"its own,\" repairing what it saw as being broken in Nihilistic's version of the game. Blizzard bought Swingin' Ape outright in May, 2005. However, Swingin' Ape still worked in their own facilities, separate from Blizzard. However, Matthew Bell has since claimed that under Swingin' Ape, Blizzard was making Ghost a priority. Feedback was carried out directly, and a cinematic was released at BlizzCon 2005. However, the Gamecube version was canceled in the same year. Reportedly, the 2005 build elicited generally positive feedback, though some Nihilstic members have mentioned that they felt resentment to the more action-focused game Ghost had become, rather than the stealth game they had originally conceived. There was also the issue that World of Warcraft had launched in 2004, and by 2005, had over a million players. Consequently, staff had to be diverted from other teams to maintain the game, Swingin' Ape included. Furthermore, Ghost had begun life at the start of one console generation, but by 2005, the next console generation was about to be launched with the Xbox 360. During the summer of 2006, Blizzard announced that StarCraft: Ghost would be indefinitely postponed while they examined the capabilities of the Playstation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii systems. According to Goddard, Blizzard was faced with the question of whether to devote even more resources to Ghost to make it ready for the new console generation, or shelve the game and possibly return to it at a later date. Bell has further commented that Ghost had been designed for consoles, but Blizzard was seeing such success on the PC that pursuing a console game no longer seemed an essential proposition. Blizzard eventually decided not to continue producing the game, as it was in internal competition with World of Warcraft and StarCraft II. Reportedly, Blizzard gave the development team the option to continue development and to bring Ghost to the current console generation. However, Bell has expressed doubts that if this had been pursued, it might not have been completed, as so many different projects (World of Warcraft, StarCraft II, and the new iteration of Diablo III) would mean that the Ghost team would struggle to get things done. Eventually Blizzard chose not to continue the game because they didn't believe it could succeed. It was supposedly 6 months away from completion at the time of its cancellation. The development team was dissolved, and assigned to other projects within Blizzard.The Aftermath  Blizzard employee Rob Pardo suggested that Ghost had failed but could be brought back; Blizzard has explained that the game was never announced as canceled or dead and it is simply focusing on other games. At the World Wide Invitational 2008 Rob Pardo has suggested that the game was a \"miss\" and so was canceled. The console division appears to have been canceled; Blizzard has no plans to reopen it and as of August 2008, no-one is working on it and it wasn't even on the radar, Blizzard having its hands full with other projects. In July 2008 the Guardian newspaper reported that Blizzard had quietly shelved StarCraft: Ghost due to the economy. At BlizzCon 2008 Mike Morhaime said that StarCraft: Ghost was losing resources in competition to World of Warcraft, StarCraft II and Diablo III, and Blizzard decided that \"now is not the right time\" for StarCraft: Ghost. At BlizzCon 2009 Chris Metzen said Ghost would \"rest in peace\". However, Michael Morhaime also suggested it could return when a team becomes available. By 2011, he stated that the game had fallen into a position where it could not succeed. Occassionally the development team behind the game has been talked to, as to whether the project could be finished. In 2011, Blizzard confirmed that StarCraft: Ghost was not in development for financial reasons. The lack of development remained true in 2012\u2014the game has no development team, and was not discussed, though according to Dustin Browder, it was not impossible that the game could be resuscitated at some point in the future. At PAX East 2013, Blizzard employee Matthew Burger stated that the project was on hold, had never been canceled, and did not rule out the game being released one day. In an interview explaining the cancellation of Titan in 2014, Mike Morhaime described StarCraft: Ghost as canceled. The game was described as being \"indefinitely postponed\" in 2015. As of BlizzCon 2015, there are no plans to continue the game, and Team 1 remains focused on StarCraft RTS games. Assets from the game, such as interior installation art, were used in StarCraft II. In 2016, an expose by games journalist Patrick Stafford featured interviews from Nihlistic, Swingin' Ape, and Blizzard staff members, detailing the history of the game's development. In 2018, an article by games journalist Jason Schreier touched on the issue of Ghost, that it and Project Titan had contributed to Blizzard's current policy of not commenting on unannounced games and keeping development on said game secret.Legacy Licensed Fiction  StarCraft: Ghost can be considered to form a sub-series of its own in the realm of tie-in StarCraft fiction, with novels and manga designated as such. According to James Waugh, the story is split into a \"meta-tale\" involving a long series of products. StarCraft: Ghost: Nova, a Keith R. A. DeCandido-authored novel and the prequel to StarCraft: Ghost, was published after development on StarCraft: Ghost was put on hiatus. It was intended to be published alongside the game (and its release was delayed in an attempt to ensure this). Focusing on Nova's backstory, the novel's plotline largely took place during the Great War. Several stories in the StarCraft: Frontline series featuring Colin Phash were linked to the graphic novel series, StarCraft: Ghost Academy. Ghost Academy is based on the adventures of Nova during her training at the Ghost Academy, taking place at the end of StarCraft: Ghost: Nova. The StarCraft OGN was to be part of the subseries, but was itself placed on indefinite hold. Plot elements of the StarCraft: Ghost storyline were revealed in a novel entitled StarCraft: Ghost: Spectres. In it, Agent Nova is sent to investigate incidents of ghosts being kidnapped.StarCraft: Ghost in StarCraft II  Elements of Ghost's featured in StarCraft II. Gabriel Tosh, a character from the subfranchise, appeared on the Hyperion in Wings of Liberty and served as a connection between the two storylines. The storyline of Ghost, especially parts revolving around the Terran Dominion, acted as a building block for StarCraft II.Horace Warfield also returned, albeit with a redesigned appearance and backstory. As revealed through optional missions offered by Tosh, Project Shadow Blade, led by Gabriel Tosh, had rebelled against the Terran Dominion, but many of its spectres were captured and put into New Folsom Prison at the hands of Agent Nova. Tosh hired Raynor's Raiders to collect materials needed to create spectres: jorium and terrazine. However, his secretiveness worried Jim Raynor. Tosh tried to hire him for a final task, a raid on New Folsom Prison. However, Nova contacted Raynor, telling him that Tosh and his spectres were psychotic, and he should help her shut down Tosh's spectre-making operations on Avernus Station. Raynor could choose to either help Tosh or Nova.Trivia  In February 2009 China banned StarCraft: Ghost's name as an e-sports brand due to issues involving \"superstition\".Nerazim  The Nerazim, or the Dark Templar as they are known to outsiders, are a number of protoss tribes who shun the Khala. The Nerazim use a verdant green as their tribal color while platinum is the dominant color on the field of battle.Overview  The Dark Templar have \"sharper\" features than the Khalai, and perceive things differently. Nerazim often cut off their psionic appendages, and developed the use of special clamps to control the energy bleed. The style of these clamps has changed over time. They can also be used for Khalai protoss who lost their own psionic appendages by accident or in battle (particularly with the zerg). Nerazim technology is similar enough to Aiur technology that these protoss can intuit how to use the technology. They are masters of time manipulation. Dark Templar, alone or in groups, have sought xel'naga artifacts. Nerazim eyes are predominantly green. Nerazim warriors have undergone centuries of discipline and training.Terrans possess a limited number of technologies that are capable of dealing with these warriors. Nerazim warriors utilize a fluid combat style that cannot be mimicked exactly by terrans.Culture  Driven by individuality and a thirst for knowledge, the Nerazim developed along a very different path than the Khalai. Nerazim work in smaller groups than the Khalai, and are far more individualistic. With a less monolithic culture, each Nerazim is encouraged to forge their own path, and they believe that fostering this attitude leads to their great successes. They remain willful and often fiercely independent, with their closest allegiance being first to clannish warrior bands and then to the Nerazim, the great tribe to which all Dark Templar belong. By their nature the Nerazim are a diverse group of freethinkers motivated by their regard for one another and tribal bonds rather than abstract notions of authority.  As such, many Nerazim develop skills outside their chosen professions, unlike in the strict caste system of the Khalai. Examples include some of their engineers also having knowledge in combat. Different clans take great pains to distinguish themselves through variations in weapons, armor, markings, and dress. Regardless of clan, reputation and personal responsibility are paramount in the eyes of any Nerazim: individuals must always be accountable for their actions. As a result, deeds rather than words act as the Dark Templar's guide. Individual clans can be prone to feuding and rivalry, but they are quick to band together against a common threat, such as that presented by the zerg. Family is important to the Nerazim, and the family unit is part of their social structure. They are less demonstrative than the Khalai when it comes to the display of emotion. The Nerazim sever their nerve cords in order to fully separate themselves from the Khala. To prevent energy bleed, the Nerazim put clamps on the cut cords. This severing leads to a weakness where Void energy channeled through the exposed nerve chords can knock a Nerazim unconscious, serving as a nonlethal way to incapacitate a Nerazim warrior. The Nerazim maintained the same system of writing as the Khalai. Unlike the Khalai however, female Nerazim are able to become figures of authority. Some Khalani phrases are exclusive to the Nerazim's vocabulary, while others that are also used by the Khalai have a different meaning to the Nerazim than their counterparts. The xel'naga retain the position of \"gods\" in Nerazim religion. They consider anything that \"taints\" the Void to be unholy. Funerary rites are conducted for the deceased. Some, if not all Nerazim appear to store their dead in mausoleums and crypts. Before officially becoming a Dark Templar, one undergoes a Shadow Walk. Only one leader of the Nerazim exists at a time.Psionic Abilities  Dark Templar were taught to hide from the Conclave by the powerful Templar Adun. This ability has been described as \"bending light\" and \"merging with shadows\". Dark Templar wield the energies of the Void. These energies are harmful to the zerg cerebrates and Overmind due to the similarities of the cosmic energies they wield. The Dark Templar consider their powers to be the \"true gifts\" of the protoss, and consider the Khala to be diluted and narrowed by the (former) leaders of the protoss, and the robbing of individuality. Their own powers are considered \"wider\". This power protects Dark Templar from zerg infestation. However, those who walk the path of the Void do so with diligence and reverence, for they know full well the dangers lurking in the shadows of the Void. Dark Templar are cut off from the preservers; they have no preservers of their own, and their memories cannot be accessed by the preservers. As they are severed from the Khala, communicating with the Nerazim via telepathy requires Khalani to actually be spoken rather than the essence of thoughts being expressed. A group of protoss survivors stranded on Aiur, the Tal'darim, were cut off from the Khala and developed abilities similar to those of the Dark Templar. All Nerazim possess a \"shadow essence.\" This essence can be fused into the stalker.History Origins  A few rogue tribes refused to submit to the Khala, believing that their individual identities would be erased to further promote the rule of the Judicator Caste. Although they were not hostile or militant, they believed that the communal agenda of the Conclave would be the eventual doom of the protoss. The rogues held no ill-will toward their brethren and attempted to live their lives unnoticed as best they could. Nonetheless their existence was known to the Conclave. They were joined further by individuals from other tribes who did not follow their kin's embrace of the Khala. More Nerazim stemmed from the Sargas Tribe than any other Khalai tribe. Approximately one thousand years before the Great War, the Conclave, under the leadership of Kortanul, had collected records on the locations of the Rogues. The Conclave ordered the Executor Adun to report to the Conclave so they could tell him about this new threat, which they believed could cause a new Aeon of Strife. Adun was given Raszagal, a young prisoner, to question. He brought her to the Citadel of the Executor so the other Templar could question her. The Conclave gave him their information so he could quietly track down the rogues, abduct them, and execute them. Adun was unable to bring himself to execute the Rogues. He transmitted fake recordings of the executions to the Conclave and hid the Rogues, even teaching them how to cloak. The Rogues ended up developing these abilities more quickly than Adun could teach them. Unfortunately, the Rogues, still learning their powers, lacked the discipline of the Khala. They inadvertently unleashed psionic storms, which spiraled out of control on Aiur. The Conclave discovered the corpses of dead Rogues, only to realize these Rogues had been depicted in the execution recordings.Exile  The Conclave could neither punish Adun nor slay the Rogues, as he would force them to publicly admit the existence of the Rogues. The Conclave decided to banish the wayward Rogues from Aiur forever on an ancient, but functional xel'naga ship, along with other protoss ships which Adun insisted they be allowed to take with them. However, last-minute squabbling threatened the Rogues\u2014Kortanul attacked Adun, prompting a psychic battle between the Rogues and the Conclave\u2014and Adun feared the Rogues might accidentally create psionic storms again. Adun created a blue mist with a combination of Khala and strange energies, which covered and protected the Rogues. However, the power caused Adun to burn out like a star. They then took the name Nerazim, to signify that they were now a new tribe of the protoss, united in their exile Shortly afterward it was discovered that the exiles had stolen the powerful Khalis crystal from the Sargas Tribe and taken it with them. The Nerazim ceremoniously cut off their nerve cords to show their disdain for the Conclave and the Judicator. This act cut them off from the Khala, forcing them to draw their psionic energies from the Void. Forevermore they would be known as the Dark Templar, as they had forsaken the Khala's light. After leaving Aiur, they adopted the name \"Nerazim,\" to give name to the new tribe that had formed from the exiles. As their legend spread across Aiur, sparking the imaginations of many young protoss, this tale worked to incriminate them. Although they were hunted and feared by their own brethren, the Nerazim never abandoned their love of Aiur and worked to safeguard it in any way they secretly could. During this time the creation of the dark archon was banned. During their exile from Aiur, the Nerazim were free to experiment with new technologies. They developed their fleet of corsairs; vessels designed to defend themselves as they had traveled through the stars. Onboard the xel'naga ship they had been exiled on, the Nerazim were able to gain access to new knowledge, which helped them create warp blades.Into the Stars  The first step on the Dark Templar's journey was the moon of Ehlna, which they discovered shortly after leaving Aiur. It had a xel'naga-crafted warp gate, so the exiled protoss stayed. They discovered the moon had a combination of energies which altered khaydarin crystals, making them quite efficient at storing memories. Without preservers, the Dark Templar had no other way to store memories, so they used this technological means. After more than two centuries, the Dark Templar departed, but some remained to operate a shrine, the Alys'aril, where the memories could be extracted from pilgrims and stored. Numerous vessels remained behind as well. Upon finding a xel'naga temple on Shakuras, the Dark Templar decided to remain there to study it. Struggling to adapt to their harsh and nearly lightless environment (protoss feed on light), the Rogue Tribes altered their skills and even their biology to cope. The abilities that Adun had taught them served them well on their adopted homeworld, and their culture flourished. Some tribes would live in other star systems and aboard small ships. During this time, both the Khalai and Nerazim fought a running conflict with one another. In 2497, Nerazim terrorists attacked a Conclave tower during the celebration of Khas'mas. Praetor Fenix fought through the terrorists, and slew them with their own warp blades. Eventually Raszagal, age 1045 in 2500 and one of few Dark Templar who was old enough to clearly remember Aiur, became Matriarch of the Dark Templar. She ruled for approximately five hundred years before the outbreak of the Brood War.The Great War The Coming of the Zerg  The Dark Templar learned of the zerg from discovering their probes and in 2500 Dark Prelate Zeratul was drawn to Char by a powerful psionic call. On Char, he encountered Executor Tassadar and overcame his prejudices. The Dark Templar were greatly concerned about the zerg and chose to test themselves in battle against small bands of zerg on Char. The zerg proved frighteningly resilient and numerous, and so the Dark Templar brought the Khalis to Char so that they might try to wield its energies against them. While Tassadar diverted Kerrigan, Zeratul killed Zasz and became temporarily linked with the Overmind. Once the Overmind's silence was broken, Zeratul's army was trapped by a cerebrate and devastated by Sarah Kerrigan. They lost the Khalis crystal. Zeratul was found by Tassadar in an installation and convinced to return with him to AiurReturn to Aiur  On Aiur, Zeratul and his dark templar helped Tassadar's followers destroy the Heart of the Conclave. However, Tassadar surrendered and Zeratul slipped away in the chaos. but they returned in time to rescue Tassadar from Judicator Aldaris. Zeratul infiltrated the primary zerg hive clusters and assassinated two cerebrates. The Conclave saw the results of this and admitted via Aldaris they were wrong about the Dark Templar. Zeratul participated in the assault on the Overmind, which ended when Tassadar channeled Dark Templar energies through the hull of the Gantrithor and crashed it into the Overmind, destroying it.The Brood War Stand on Shakuras  Zeratul banded together with Aldaris, Praetor Fenix and Commander Jim Raynor in order to unite and lead the Khalai survivors. He offered to shelter them on Shakuras and found them passage to the warp gate. On Shakuras, the Dark Templar rescued the refugees when they were ambushed by hydralisks. Raszagal welcomed the Khalai to Shakuras and ordered the death of two cerebrates who had infested the temple grounds. The Dark Templar were instrumental in this. It was then that Kerrigan arrived and Raszagal, who had been mentally enslaved by Kerrigan, asked the protoss to accept Kerrigan's assistance. While Kerrigan and Zeratul assisted Praetor Artanis and the Executor in securing the Uraj and Khalis crystals, Aldaris began an open revolt against Raszagal, who in turn ordered his death. Zeratul felt something was wrong with Raszagal, who was normally gentle, but followed her orders, even authorizing the creation of dark archons to match Aldaris' forces. Kerrigan killed Aldaris before he could reveal Raszagal's secret, and Zeratul banished her from Shakuras. Raszagal claimed that she was wearied by recent events. With her encouragement, Zeratul carried the Khalis to the temple while Artanis carried the Uraj. They channeled the temple's energies, resulting in an explosion which obliterated the zerg on Shakuras.Ulrezaj's Rebellion  A combined Templar and Dark Templar force left Shakuras to conduct a mission on Aiur; the rescue of a number of wounded protoss warriors abandoned in stasis cells on the world. The protoss had to fight their way past zerg colonies to do so, but when they reached the stasis cells, a quartet of Dark Templar appeared and destroyed two of them (killing the protoss within). They were forced to surrender before they could destroy the third cell. These Dark Templar were led by Ulrezaj, who hated the thought of harboring Khalai on Shakuras. He claimed that slaying the high born Templar was a sacred act. In a demonstration of protoss unity, a tribunal consisting of protoss from Aiur and Dark Templar sentenced Ulrezaj to imprisonment. The trial was interrupted by an attack of terrans. Early in the attack, they freed Ulrezaj and his minions, who stole a number of khaydarin crystals before fleeing. Ulrezaj had created an alliance with Alan Schezar and his Scavengers, who had previously used khaydarin crystal-based techniques to control a cerebrate and thus an entire brood. Their plots included using warped khaydarin crystals to control and mutate zerg until they could withstand the power of the xel'naga temple and to use a powerful EMP Generator during battle against the protoss of Shakuras. Their plan involved unleashing the enhanced zerg upon Shakuras, which would cause the Dark Templar to flee to their hidden places, leaving the protoss from Aiur exposed to assault. However, the plan partially failed; a combined Khalai/Dark Templar force destroyed his warped crystals. Ulrezaj and Schezar still tried the second part of their plan, using the EMP Generator to weaken the opposing protoss forces, while Schezar's Scavengers and the Fist of Ulrezaj attacked, but they were defeated.Web of Treachery  Raszagal was kidnapped by Kerrigan's minions when Talematros was destroyed. Zeratul traveled in a carrier to Char Aleph, demanding to know why Raszagal had been taken. Kerrigan revealed that she stole Raszagal to use as leverage in getting him and his brethren to kill the Overmind for her, but Zeratul had reservations. He obeyed only when Raszagal asked him to do it for the sake of the protoss. Zeratul and his dark templar went to the surface of Char and killed the Overmind. Zeratul then demanded that Kerrigan release Raszagal at once. However, when Kerrigan asked if she wished to return to her people, Raszagal replied that she wished only to serve Kerrigan and remain at her side. Zeratul realized that Kerrigan had corrupted Raszagal's mind, explaining Aldaris's earlier rebellion. Zeratul circumvented Kerrigan's defenses and rescued Raszagal before regrouping with a number of protoss survivors on the surface of Char, but Kerrigan and her broods closed in before they were capable of dimensional recall. Zeratul dealt Raszagal a mortal blow rather than let her be recaptured. In her last moments, Raszagal thanked Zeratul for freeing her from Kerrigan's control and named him the new leader of the Dark Templar. Feeling unfit to succeed Raszagal, Zeratul went into self-imposed exile.Reunification  Following the death of Raszagal, Mohandar was chosen to speak for the Nerazim on the Hierarchy. He supported Artanis to lead the Hierarchy, and though he initially was resistant, Artanis accepted. In the proceeding years, leadership of the recombined protoss civilization fell to Hierarch Artanis, who struggled to maintain unity against the deep-seated distrust and resentment between the Khalai and Nerazim. Raszagal's name was frequently invoked to keep the peace. Wishing to preserve the old ways of the Nerazim, Matriarch Vorazun had many disagreements with Artanis during debates in the Twilight Council. While the Nerazim were initially welcoming of the Khalai, their brethren's demand for resources soon stirred tensions. The prior zerg invasion of their world caused the Nerazim to become more battle-hardened. The Nerazim combined their technologies with those of the Khalai. Their collaboration produced astonishing new developments, including the void ray and the stalker. Although the Nerazim were counted as part of the Daelaam\u2014a united protoss people, internal tensions led to tribalism in both the Nerazim and Khalai.The Second Great War Maw of the Void  A group of dark templar were imprisoned by the Tal'darim on a derelict xel'naga worldship in the Sigma Quadrant. They offered to assist Raynor against the Tal'darim if he released them.Children of the Void  As the Khalai rebuilt the Golden Armada with the intention of reclaiming Aiur, tensions rose between the Nerazim and Khalai protoss. The Nerazim began to feel the Khalai's presence was eroding away at their culture, and that the Khalai's obsession with reclaiming Aiur was causing unneeded misery upon the Nerazim. Vorazun, the daughter of Raszagal, was outspoken critic of the Khalai and Hierarch Artanis. Vorazun and Mohandar would get into verbal sparring matches, and she viewed the aged Nerazim as a puppet of Artanis. Vorazun's activism prevented the Khalai from mining the Naszar, a holy site for the Nerazim. An accident occurred where a squadron of phoenixes collided with a Nerazim transport, killing twenty three Nerazim civilians. Artanis did not attend their funeral, causing Vorazun to view Artanis as one who cared little of Nerazim culture. Tensions came to a high when Vorazun's student, Taelus, seized control of the Citadel with the intension of sparking conflict between the Khalai and Nerazim, so that the Khalai would be repelled from Shakuras. Vorazun and Mohandar went in to negotiate with them before Executor Selendis could raid the Citadel with a squadron of zealots. Taelus refused to back down, forcing Vorazun and Mohandar to fight Taelus and his followers. At first they attempted to take them down using non-lethal means, but Taelus killed Mohandar. Vorazun then fought Taelus, killing him and ending the crisis. Later, Vorazun met with Artanis, stating he would carry out the funeral rites for Mohandar. Taelus was buried beside him as a sign of respect. Artanis stated he would support Vorazun's ascension to Matriarch, and Vorazun agreed that she would commit some of her forces to the upcoming invasion of Aiur, but stated she had to leave some of her forces behind on Shakuras. Vorazun's ascension to Matriarch would later go through, making her ruler of the Nerazim.End War  The Nerazim tracked the reclamation of Aiur until they were cut off and the warp gate linking Shakuras to Aiur was reopened. The Shadow Guard was decimated by hybrid and zerg under Amon, who proceeded to obliterate Shakuras's cities. Vorazun's dark templar aided Artanis in clearing the infestation from the launch bays in the southwest quadrant of Talematros, allowing Vorazun to complete the evacuation. The Nerazim then fought alongside Artanis's warriors unto the destruction of Shakuras. Vorazun sent her most elite dark templar scour the Koprulu sector. They tracked Moebius Corps to their base within Revanscar. Nerazim born on Shakuras saw Aiur for the first time when they came to strike at Amon, having only heard tales of their homeland. Vorazun purged Antioch of the zerg with Tal'darim Highlord Alarak, then sent her dark templar to aid Artanis in the xel'naga caverns. The Nerazim assisted in destroying the Void shards surrounding Amon's host body and held the northern entrance to the temple where the Keystone charged. In the aftermath of their victory, the Nerazim had successfully reclaimed Aiur alongside their protoss brethren. In the months to come, Nerazim structures were seen among those being rebuilt on Aiur. When Artanis led the Daelaam into the Void for the final strike against Amon, they were accompanied by dark templar, stalkers, annihilators, and dark archons.Observers in the Shadows  After the defeat of Amon, the Nerazim began developing new technologies, including a throwing weapon named the warp disk. In addition, the Nerazim wished to observe their terran neighbors, to ascertain whether they would be a long term ally or a future threat. With the blessings of Hierarch Artanis, the Nerazim sent a dark templar named Ulavu to both observe the terrans and find how the telekinesis of their psionic ghosts could be used with the warp disk. As the rebuilding of Aiur commenced, a cultural movement to artistically move back to the protoss's ancient days of the Golden Age of Expansion occurred, something that deeply disturbed many Nerazim. When Khalai phase-smiths and craftsmen redesigned Nerazim war machines such as stalkers and oracles in the Khalai style, it was met with offense by many Nerazim. Some dark templar threw their support behind the artistic movement and embraced the Golden Age in their armor and armaments, but some Nerazim speculated that these warriors were bribed. Matriarch Vorazun refused to comment on this movement, and it was not officially recognized by the leadership of the Daelaam.Nerazim Organizations  Judging the total power of the Nerazim is almost impossible, for most are nomadic folk scattered across dozens of star systems in small ships and hidden enclaves. It's quite possible that their combined strength is enormous.Clans and Tribes Warbands  The Nerazim often operate in independent warbands. Known warbands include;Notable Nerazim Nerazim Technology Terrestrial Aerospace Notes Roach  The roach is a zerg ground unit in StarCraft II.Overview  The roach is a particularly tough, armored breed which possesses a high-speed regeneration ability when burrowed. This quick regeneration is due to the constant breakdown to the roachs's own modified pharynx, a natural byproduct of the zerg's acid production, an intentional design by the Swarm in order to facilitate quicker regrowth. A roach is slightly shorter than a terran wearing CMC armor. Roaches evolved from the fast-healing zantar slug of Garrxax and were in use by 2501, taking part in a battle on Shi. Their ranged acid saliva attack is capable of penetrating neosteel and armor, and violently dissolving flesh on multiple entry points. This saliva is derived from the zantar slug and is expelled with considerable force through the muscles that surround the roach's salivary glands\u2014highly specialized striated ducts that produce a unique enzyme that weaponizes the creature's already corrosive saliva. This acid contains viroids that propagate through their victem's nervous system, which can only be either addressed through heavy bachteriophage treatments or by removal of the affected limb. Due to their heavy armor, roaches are unable to aim their acid at aerial targets. If pressed into close quarters, roaches use scythe-like blades on their backs to dispatch the enemy. The hardness of these scythes allows roaches to scythe through neosteel and armor with ease. Roaches have the ability to evolve into ravagers, a fierce artillery strain that lobs corrosive bile at a long range. The roach's metabolism is ten times greater than that of the zantar slug (increased through assimilation), and gained the ability to quickly regenerate even the most grievous wounds when burrowed. This is through a process known as osmotic epithelium. The absorption of soil compounds, especially rare earths and metals, has allowed roaches to develop extremely thick carapaces. Some Dominion scientists have theorized that the roach is not immune to the ravages of its acidic body fluids, and the creature's potent regeneration capabilities ensure tissue integrity in spite of constant corrosion. The roach's thoracic acid bladder is similar to those organelles found in mutalisks. The Leviathan Brood roaches are known to be incredibly aggressive due to vespene exposure. After the ascension of Zagara to supreme ruler of the swarm, Abathur was ordered to continue to experiment with the roach genome in a continuing pursuit of perfection. This resulted in variant strains of the roach. Sometime after the Second Great War, roaches gained the ability to evolve into ravagers.Tactics  One on one, few are capable of taking on a roach and winning. They are deployed when zerglings start to be thinned out and are sometimes supported by infestors. When paired with zerglings, they can be nearly unstoppable against marines bereft of siege tank or bunker support. Roaches are nearly impervious to small-arms fire, and nigh immune to flame-based weapons, and explosives and artillery are a must for terran forces when these creatures are deployed.Game Unit Versus  The roach is a ranged unit, giving it added utility at choke points. The roach rises slightly when it attacks. It also has a melee attack that it, like the hydralisk, performs at close range for the same damage as the ranged attack. Roaches are strong against hellions, zealots, and zerglings, and weak against MMM, immortals, and ultralisks. Thors, stalkers, and siege tanks also pose a strong threat to roaches due to their bonus damage against armored targets. They have no anti-air attack. Roaches inherit the roles of medium attacker and ambusher from the original StarCraft's hydralisk and lurker. To compensate for its lack of anti-air attack, it is common to see roaches combined with hydralisks. A common strategy is for roaches to absorb damage while hydralisks deal it.Heart of the Swarm  In the campaign of Heart of the Swarm, roaches may be evolved into either corpsers or vile roaches after completing the required evolution mission.Co-op Missions  Zagara is able to summon sacs of roaches with timed life in Co-op Missions. Otherwise, roaches are exclusive to Abathur. Abathur is able to evolve his roaches into ravagers, and they upgrade to the vile strain when he reaches Level 14. Additional upgrades for roaches and ravagers are unlocked when Abathur reaches Level 4. Dehaka has access to primal roaches, which can evolve into primal igniters or primal guardians.Roach Strategies  On normal and rush maps, roaches are well suited for the early and mid-game.Zerg vs Terran  A roach/baneling combo is very powerful against terrans, as the roaches will soak damage, enabling the banelings to get close to the enemy and deal their high damage attacks.Zerg vs Zerg  Roaches and zerglings are used early in ZvZ matches. Roaches are a more defensive unit compared to zerglings. Cost for cost, roaches win against zerglings at chokepoints but lose in open areas. Later in the game, numerous roaches can defeat numerous zerglings even in open areas.Zerg vs Protoss  Roaches are a great way to defend an early expo against 2 Gate zealot push. Mass overwhelming roaches is also quite strong against a fast teching opponent, even one who goes air. Use roaches to soak up colossus damage until ultralisks or air units can support.General  Roaches, coupled with their speed and burrow move upgrades, make great harassment units at exposed bases. Roaches are a great staple unit and have great value for cost, but take up control quickly. In direct encounters with enemy armies of equal supply, mass roach is more likely to lose.Special Roach Strains Marauder  The marauder is a terran infantry unit in StarCraft II. It replaced the firebat in multiplayer during development.Overview  Primarily a support unit for marines against heavy ground targets, the marauder arose from post-Brood War studies by the Dominion Armed Forces, showing a greater need of combat units better able to defeat zerg carapaces. To meet this requirement, the 5-4 Armored Infantry Suit was developed from the firebat's CMC-660 and equipped with two Quad K12 \"Punisher\" grenade launchers on each arm. The suit's grenade auto-loader is stocked with components that allow it to manufacture and load hundreds of standard Punisher grenades. By 2503, marauders were being fielded. The troops manning the suits are quite different to their firebat counterparts. As of 2504, 47% have never been to jail, and only 23% have ever been accused of murder. Marauder fatalities were commonplace prior to the implementation of kinetic foam into their suits, which allowed them to survive impacts that had previously killed operators, even while leaving the suit unharmed. A more powerful version of the CMC-660s used by marauders was approved for field testing, and any marauder who volunteered were compensated with credits. The Dominion Special Forces surveyed marauders on how to improve their hardware, and the resounding answer was to increase the size of their guns. This feedback was taken in account when creating a Special Forces variant of the marauder's armor. Marauders make up some of the original crew of Mira's Marauders. It has been speculated that these marauders are either extremely loyal compared to other mercenaries, or Mira just has exceptionally compelling blackmail on them. The Umojan Protectorate also has access to marauders, which are equipped with more advanced suits than their counterparts.Game Unit StarCraft II  The marauder can only attack ground targets. Its attack is more powerful against armored units; it may slow units, except for massive units. The marauder is an early-game support unit, useful for supporting marines by slowing fast melee units. It is effective against armored units, like the roach. They are also powerful against stalkers, and, to a lesser extent, siege tanks, immortals and thors. Marauders can destroy buildings very quickly. The marauder is vulnerable to zealots, marines, and zerglings. As a general rule, a player battling zerg should build fewer marauders than usual, while against the protoss, marauders are effective, though work well with medivac dropships as a \"commando force\" when battling the former. Marauders without medivac support are not ideal for attacking photon cannons.Wings of Liberty  Marauders are unlocked by playing the mission \"Smash and Grab,\" available after Rory Swann was able to procure them for Raynor's Raiders. In the Wings of Liberty campaign, marauders cannot use stimpacks. A variant of the marauder appears in the mission \"The Great Train Robbery,\" designated as a Dominion kill team. They deal slightly more damage than normal marauders and have a unique color scheme, but are otherwise identical to the normal marauder.Nova Covert Ops  In Nova Covert Ops, marauders can equip one of various provided upgrades and abilities for each mission.Co-op Missions  Marauders appear in\u00a0Co-op Missions\u00a0on the\u00a0Miner Evacuation\u00a0map as part of the infested. These Marauders are identical to regular Marauders, except with a neural parasite attached to their model. In Co-op Missions, marauders are able to be constructed by Jim Raynor. Nova gains access to the advanced Marauder commando, with enhanced life, damage and abilities. Tychus can field an elite hero outlaw marauder named Rattlesnake.Development  The idea behind the marauder was to act as a sort of middleground between marines and vikings\u2014mechanized infantry, yet not an actual mech. The marauder was originally equipped with dual concussion-grenade launchers which reduce a biological unit's speed immediately by a set percentage. A charging zealot would still move quickly after being struck by a grenade. Prior to StarCraft II beta patch #8, Concussion Grenades was an automatic upgrade. It later became a researched ability. The Kinetic Foam upgrade in the single player campaign was originally known as \"Ablative Scales\". The original design for the button was even completed but was never used in the final product. In Legacy of the Void, the marauder's attack was modified; it now deals 2 hits per attack instead of 1, but has the same DPS - this makes armor more effective against them. This was primarily meant to nerf marauders versus Protoss, but also makes the marauder much less effective against fully-upgraded ultralisks than in Heart of the Swarm.Heroes of the Storm  Marauders appear as melee minion units on the maps Braxis Holdout and Warhead Junction in Heroes of the Storm. A marauder skin for Muradin also appears in game, and references the Hammer Securities marauder mercenaries.Known Marauders Specialists Trivia StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void  Legacy of the Void is the name of the StarCraft II protoss campaign and episode. It is the third and final StarCraft II product, released separately from the other two games, Wings of Liberty and Heart of the Swarm, occurring after them chronologically, beginning immediately after the ending of Heart of the Swarm. It was expected to be priced as an expansion in 2009. However, it was released as an independent installment, not requiring any previous version of StarCraft II to run. It has received a simultaneous PC/Mac release. The game's beta began on March 31, 2015. Pre-purchasing the game gives access to the beta and to the Whispers of Oblivion mini-campaign. The game was released on November 10, 2015.Storyline  The story of Legacy of the Void concludes the StarCraft II trilogy, picking up where Heart of the Swarm ended. It contains three mission prologue campaign Whispers of Oblivion, featuring Zeratul as he attempts to make sense of the scattered prophecy that spoke of the return of Amon. The central campaign begins with the reclamation of Aiur, which goes awry due to the return of Amon and the corruption of the Khala. As Hierarch Artanis, the player must unite the scattered protoss factions, and find a way to force Amon back into the Void. The campaign features planets from previous games such as Korhal and Shakuras, as well as new locations such as Ulnar and Glacius. The main campaign features 19 missions, with an additional two extra mini-campaigns featuring three missions each. An additional three mission campaign, named Into the Void, serves as an epilogue for Legacy of the Void, and as a conclusive end to the story arc started in StarCraft.Reclamation  Reclamation shows a conversation between Artanis and Kaldalis on an asteroid or planetoid orbiting Aiur. The protoss reclamation of Aiur from the zerg begins the next day. Artanis doubts whether it is right for many protoss to die to reclaim the symbol of the old protoss civilization, one that lost Aiur due to its own critical flaw of disunity. Kaldalis counters that the reclamation is for the new unified protoss civilization, and that its future is worth fighting for. Artanis is placated, and the two return to the Golden Armada.Unity  The opening cinematic, as narrated by Artanis, shows a protoss force battling against the zerg in an effort to retake Aiur. Kaldalis stated that with the Khala they couldn't lose. During the battle, the group's high templar merged into an archon. The protoss appeared to lose, when more were warped into combat to confront the zerg.Gameplay  The attack speed of units in the game has, as of February 2015, been reduced by 40% when compared to Heart of the Swarm, while adding damage to compensate. Scan range has also been increased in order to increase unit effectiveness in combat.Singleplayer  Legacy of the Void is primarily a singleplayer expansion. The campaign was intended to focus on Zeratul as its main character but the focus later changed to Artanis by 2014. The game features a prologue named Whispers of Oblivion, which was released early for those who preordered the game. Much like the Hyperion and Kerrigan's leviathan in previous expansions, Artanis travels on the arkship Spear of Adun during the campaign, where he can with characters such as Phasesmith Karax and Grand Preserver Rohana. The ship can be upgraded by obtaining solarite. The campaign features the ability to choose between units and technologies from four different protoss factions, each with varying abilities and roles. These units can be changed at any time between missions, and more options are unlocked as the campaign progresses. Units from StarCraft: Brood War, including the corsair, dragoon, reaver, dark archon, and arbiter reappear as unlockable unit options. Legacy of the Void's campaign was to designed to own feel distinct from Wings of Liberty and Heart of the Swarm. In the latter, Kerrigan composed a great portion of her forces' strength by herself. For Legacy of the Void, while Legacy of the Void was designed so single protoss warrior would be comparable to her in that regard via gameplay. The game contains several missions where the player controls powerful heroes, such as Artanis. The player is able to choose the order of visiting planets in a manner similar to previous games. Bonus objectives can be completed within missions for solarite, which upgrades the support abilities of the Spear of Adun. The game features a three mission epilogue Into the Void, in which the player uses factions and abilities from all three previous campaigns. It is designed to conclude the story started in StarCraft.Characters Multiplayer  New units were confirmed at BlizzCon 2014, along with Archon Mode and Allied Commanders, later renamed Co-op Missions. The game features automated tournaments; Blizzard is considering a 30 minute maximum to prevent drawn out tornument matches, at which point, the side that has gained the most XP in the match will be declared the match winner. New tilesets has been implemented. Blizzard evaluate to add or remove units prior to and during the game's beta. Many of the new maps in the game are protoss-themed. Blizzard hopes that the maps are of greater diversity than previous installments, especially in regards to rush maps vs. macro maps. Blizzard intended to focus on micromanagement (to avoid simply using large unit clumps), harassment, and constant attacks with the new expansion. \"Passive time\", such as the low-activity early-game, will be avoided. Changes include reducing the amount of minerals and vespene gas in order to encourage the creation of new expansions. The starting worker count has been increased from 6 to 12, and the starting buildings (command center, nexus and hatchery) creates more supply, psi and control to make creating new workers possible. The game's multiplayer is intended to give a sense of constant combat. Game speed has been reduced to be syncronous with real-time. This affects speed values, movement speed values, cooldown times, research times, upgrade times, and unit build times, which brings the need to re-memorize them. Players were encouraged to offer feedback as to whether this change is preferable. Mech and air upgrades are split in this game. Blizzard considered making adjustments to the game's ladder system. At the start of multiplayer matches, all (possible) enemy positions on the map are highlighted by a red circle. This circle disappears after 25 seconds. In an upcoming update, MMR will be separated by race in both ranked and unranked play.Protoss  The following protoss units are added/altered in the game:Terran  The following terran units are added/altered in the game:Zerg  The following zerg units are added/altered in the game:Development  By 2013 Blizzard Entertainment had begun working on Legacy of the Void's story, scripts and missions. The development team (at least for the singleplayer) is mostly the same as the one that worked on Wings of Liberty, though new artists were brought onto the game's art team that had not worked on Heart of the Swarm. Additionally, prior to the summer of 2013, members of Team 4 who had worked on Titan were transferred to work on Legacy. By February 2014, Blizzard was \"hard at work\" on the game, and work on the game's cinematics was well underway. By August 2014, the development team was in discussion concerning community suggestions pertaining to the expansion. The game was formally revealed at BlizzCon 2014. The game will continue to be supported post-release.Storyline  The story of Legacy of the Void was the first point of development for the game, as the gameplay of StarCraft II had been solidified with the previous titles. The story was worked on collaboratively between James Waugh, Chris Metzen, Samwise Didier, Jason Huck, Allen Dilling, Justin Thavirat, Matt Morris, and Dustin Browder over the period of several months. Waugh served as the lead writer, while the overall story arc was created by Metzen, who had a more hands off role when compared to previous installments.Valerie Watrous served as a co-writer. One of the original writing inspirations was Seven Samurai. It iwas intended to be a protoss story first and foremost, that it service the protoss primarily, while also wrapping up lingering threads from the previous games. As of August 2013, the game's story had been written, many of the cinematics had been completed, and voice actors had begun work. The story was intended to capture the tragic nature of war, and to have a dark tone, as per it being the final installment in the StarCraft II trilogy. It was thematically based around the idea of a race that needs to change, how the protoss have been bound to a method of thinking that has served its time. It was intended for the story to have the following tenants: Through the nature of the Khala, it is intended that the game explore themes of collectivism vs. individuality. Per the above \"fantasy\" tenant, the overall fantasy of Legacy of the Void corresponds to the protoss returning to the fore, for one last battle. A challenge for writing for the game is that the protoss do not possess the same kind or amount of body language as humans. The writers watched episodes of ER, for as it per its nature as a medical drama, the characters' faces are often covered bar their eyes. Eye movement was studied in regards to how it could apply to protoss characters, as their eyes are their main conveyers of emotion. While the protoss are intended to be \"unkowable\" (in regards to humans/terrans), it was also intended that elements of humanity still shine through. Zeratul was originally the protagonist of the game - he had featured prominently in the previous installments of the StarCraft II trilogy. However, the protagonist role was changed to Artanis, as the developers felt that as Legacy of the Void was a protoss story, Artanis was in a better position to represent the protoss race as a whole. It was decided that Zeratul's role was best served as a mentor figure in the game's story, said role likened to that of Obi-Wan Kenobi from the Star Wars universe in this regard. Originally, characters from The Dark Templar Saga were to feature in the game. However, according to Waugh, their inclusion felt forced, and the idea was abandoned.Tie-in Media  Similar to previous installments, Legacy of the Void has received tie-in media. Reclamation is a prequel short that takes place just prior to the game's opening cinematic. A quintet of short stories will be released in the leadup to the game.Singleplayer  By BlizzCon 2014, work was still being done on balancing the campaign. By June 2015, the game's Brutal mode was being balanced. The developers are open to including Easter eggs in the game. However, Easter eggs are usually inserted towards the end of production, and as of the above date, had not been considered. A focus of development was that gameplay drive story in the game, and that the two mesh well together. As of November 2013, Dustin Browder was satisfied with the game's story, but felt the missions and campaign mechanics needed more work, to make them \"feel\" like protoss missions.Multiplayer  In 2011, Chris Sigaty expressed doubt that new units would be added to the game, and that if they are added, it is likely that other units will be removed from multiplayer. This was refuted by Blizzard employee Kevin Johnson in 2013 stating that \"no new units isn\u2019t a direction we\u2019re considering or have ever considered.\" New units were revealed at BlizzCon 2014. The game's beta was announced in March, 2015.Collector's Edition  The game has a collector's edition. It includes the following:Reception  The game sold 1 million copies within its first 24 hours of going on sale after release.Ratings Trivia Tychus Findlay  Tychus J. Findlay was a terran marine with a larcenous attitude. He was an old friend of Jim Raynor.Biography Early Life  Tychus Findlay was born on Mar Sara in a very small, boring town where truckers often stopped. He ran away from home at the age of twelve and never looked back.Confederate Marine Operation Early Retirement  By 2488, midway through the Guild Wars, Tychus Findlay, based on Raydin III, had reached the rank of staff sergeant. He had little love for the military however, seeing the Terran Confederacy government it served as corrupt and the people as weak for allowing the government to fool them. Findlay was the second-in-command of Captain Jack Larimer's Tactical Response Squad, a position which enabled him to monitor Larimer's communications and gave him access to valuable information, such as the movements of materials captured from the Kel-Morian Combine at Prosser's Well. The treasure had yet to be inventoried, so he hatched a deal with Master Sergeant Calvin (commander of a military transportation company) and Gunnery Sergeant Sims (the supply sergeant in charge of the treasure). Findlay would be paid in silium crystals. However, Findlay was dragged into one of Captain Larimer's schemes. The Tactical Response Squad flew a Kel-Morian-marked dropship to a civilian dissident's house and attacked, making it seem as if the Combine was opposed to the dissidents as well (or at least covering up Confederate involvement). Larimer's tactics put the squad in severe danger, prompting Findlay to punch him. Loyal Corporal \"Troll\" Wasser and other marines captured Findlay.Down and Up  After a tribunal, Findlay was demoted to private and ordered to serve three months hard labor at Military Correctional Facility-R-156, a converted mine. He was singled out for punishment by Sergeant Bellamy, who liked to use a swagger stick to punish larger inmates. Findlay was ordered to pull a mine cart by himself. Bellamy also drew the ire of Sam Lassiter, whom he had imprisoned in a box for several days. Lassiter used a fork to stab Bellamy, causing him to temporarily retreat. Findlay used the opportunity to steal Bellamy's swagger stick and place it on the cart's rail path. When Bellamy returned, he began looking for his stick. When he found it, Findlay shouted out a \"warning\" and disabled the cart's brake (ensuring another prisoner would draw the blame). Bellamy was killed. The other prisoner was boxed as punishment and died as a result. Findlay was eventually released and sent to Fort Howe, Turaxis II. Once there, he tried to resupply himself, but was ordered to come back later by a young lance corporal, Jim Raynor. Findlay's attempts to intimidate Raynor failed, in part because Raynor's friend, Hank Harnack, pointed a weapon at Findlay's head. He left and was able to retrieve his gear later, but his pride remained wounded. Findlay was later ordered to report to Lieutenant Colonel Javier Vanderspool, the commanding officer at Howe. Vanderspool threatened Findlay with being made a prisoner in his own body but decided to give him another chance, \"promoting\" him to sergeant (one rank below his original position). Now-Sergeant Findlay found himself in charge of Raynor and his friends \u2014 Hank Harnack, Ryk Kydd, Connor Ward and Max Zander \u2014 and immediately set out to make their lives miserable. They were interrupted by an announcement from Vanderspool, reporting a Kel-Morian attack. Raynor suggested heading for the armory, and Findlay, while taking charge, agreed. During the battle, Findlay used his rifle to beat Kel-Morian ripper foreman Oleg Benson to death. At they armory they discovered Confederate marines loading civilian-driven trucks with valuable equipment. Findlay and Raynor captured the trucks and were surprised to be let free. Findlay reported that the enemy had looted the armory and his troops were in pursuit of the trucks. \"Hotel-One\" ordered him to stop but Findlay claimed technical difficulties. The two trucks were driven to Whitford where the treasure was hidden in a chapel. Raynor realized that Findlay had simply stolen another criminal's scheme but couldn't find a way out of his dilemma. He suggested returning one truck to allay suspicion, while the 8 million credits worth of stolen jammers would be sold off. Two days later, Findlay was once again summoned to Vanderspool's office. Now a colonel, Vanderspool told Findlay about a new initiative, creating a Special Tactics and Mission Platoon within the newly formed 321st Colonial Rangers Battalion that he led. Lieutenant Marcus Quigby ended up in charge. However, Vanderspool didn't trust Findlay or his new friends, so he sent a spy, crab-addicted Petty Officer 3rd Class Lisa Cassidy, a fleet medic, to watch over them. The platoon was introduced to the CMC-230 XE armor by Technician Hiram Feek. The armor was capable of \"jumping\" great distances and slowing down falls from dropships. Findlay easily adapted to the new equipment. He also struck up a romantic relationship with Cassidy. Findlay arranged to sell the jammers in Whitford. While the trade was successful, hijackers attempted to rob them afterward. However, Findlay and friends fought them off.Betrayals  Max Zander sold his take of the proceeds of crime for food, which he would give to the refugees. He took Connor Ward and Hiram Feek with him for assistance. They were captured at the town of Finner's Crossing by Silas Trask's bandits, although Feek escaped. Jim Raynor proposed going to a pub, Hurley's, to collect information about their missing comrades. Feek armed the squad with experimental weapons. The off-duty troops raided the house, killing bandits and rescuing their friends. Days later, Findlay returned to Hurley's and nearly beat the proprietor, Hurley, to death for ratting them out to the bandits. Meanwhile Cassidy reported the squad's \"earnings\" to Vanderspool, who plotted revenge. However, the squad was too valuable to immediately throw away (due to their specialized armor training).A Legend is Born  Now-Colonel Javier Vanderspool presented the Special Tactics and Mission Platoon to Captain Clair Hobarth, a dropship pilot who had been captured by the Kel-Morians and taken to Kel-Morian Internment Camp-36. She had escaped and brought intelligence on the facility. The platoon was given special training at \"Camp Crash\" to prepare for assaulting it. During training, Findlay clashed with Max Speer, a recently-arrived embedded UNN reporter. Meanwhile, Jim Raynor planned on infiltrating the facility. Findlay brought the plan to Vanderspool, who agreed with it. At the command center, Findlay encountered Private Sam Lassiter, who was acting \"too\" politely and couldn't even remember his previous imprisonment. The special platoon dropped out of the sky and assaulted the internment camp. Findlay and his friends in the First Squad rescued Raynor and Cole Hickson, another prisoner, from their public torture. However, they were unable to bring in other dropships to rescue the hundreds of prisoners due to Kel-Morian Hellhound counterattacks. Instead, Raynor suggested stealing the Kel-Morian vehicles and traveling into the disputed zone. During the journey, they were attacked by the Snakehead Kommando as well as Hellhounds, but held out long enough for Confederate Avenger support and troops dropped off by dropships to rescue them. The Snakeheads were wiped out and the prisoners rescued. The media began publicizing the \"Heaven's Devils\" as a result.Sacrifices  Colonel Javier Vanderspool planned the third assault on Polk's Pride, a city split by the Paddick River. The Kel-Morian Combine controlled the north, while the Confederacy controlled the south. The STM platoon, now led by Lieutenant Samantha Sanchez, would fight near the front, crossing the river and aiming for a strategic resources depository which fueled the Kel-Morian war effort. The platoon fought its way past numerous Kel-Morian barriers. Findlay, sometimes toting a gauss cannon, displayed his own heroics, in one case throwing a grenade into a dropship's air intakes, causing it to explode. After a sniper killed Sanchez, putting Findlay back in command of the platoon, they reached the repository itself. It was defended by Guild Guards, who were renowned for their martial arts training. Findlay managed to defeat their taskmaster by shoving a grenade into his helmet, sealing it and watching the resulting explosion. Eventually the Confederates captured the repository but at great cost in neurally resocialized troops. In celebration of victory, Findlay's squad had their picture taken.Devils' End  Max Zander and Ryk Kydd had overheard a conversation between Colonel Vanderspool, Old Family member Errol Bennet (the father of Kydd) and Kel-Morian overseer Aaron Pax. They intended to hijack a Kel-Morian ardeon crystal train shipment at the town of Korsy and split the proceeds. Vanderspool planned to murder the Heaven's Devils platoon after the fighting. Findlay and Raynor plotted revenge; they would steal the crystals for themselves. Findlay coopted Second Squad leader Sergeant Pinkham and even found a buyer at Free Port. Pretending not to know anything was amiss, they cooperated with Vanderspool as they took control of Korsy's small starport. Vanderspool ordered the Heaven's Devils to sweep the western part of town while his team, including Lieutenant Fitz and numerous neurally resocialized marines, would take control of the train station. While he was gone, Findlay disabled his platoon's dropship and put it under the control of Private Haster. The Heaven's Devils sweep went easily for the most part, as their opposition consisted of unarmored guards who were being used to control the civilian populace. In one engagement however, Pinkham was killed. Reaching the train station, the Heaven's Devils were put in front of the resocialized marines. When the train arrived, Overseer Pax executed a double cross, forcing Vanderspool's troops and the Heaven's Devils to fight side-by-side against the Kel-Morians. The train escaped, taking with it the treasure. Enraged, he turned on the Devils. He knew much of their plotting, as Petty Officer Lisa Cassidy had betrayed them in return for access to crab. Findlay tried to attack, but Fitz stopped him by taking Cassidy prisoner and threatening to kill her. The First Squad escaped, with an enraged Findlay providing covering fire. The retreat to the starport was a disaster, with several members of the squad being killed; only Findlay, Raynor and Kydd made it alive. There they found Vanderspool and Cassidy, who had been captured by Overseer Pax and a small number of rippers. During the firefight Pax, the rippers and Cassidy were all killed. Raynor and Findlay went AWOL. The Confederate military charged the duo in absentia with manslaughter.Outlaws  Following the Guild Wars, Findlay and Raynor became outlaws, pulling off thefts across the Koprulu sector. Findlay developed a habit of exaggerating his exploits. One of their most regular targets was the Shale Express, hitting it at least a dozen times. Not even the deployment of outriders could stop them.Haji  In 2489, the pair were cornered on Haji by Confederate forces led by General Sol Kervock. Buildings around them were burned, causing casualties, but the pair escaped. The pair then brazenly stole a pair of Confederate vultures and began rescuing civilians caught in the fire. As the civilians rallied to them, the two even captured General Kervock. They released him, but Kervock plotted revenge along with his subordinate Ternas Shan and troops disguised as civilians. They ambushed the criminal duo, but the plan failed as the civilian populace killed many of them. Shan took the opportunity to murder Kervock. The duo were charged with Kervock's murder.New Sydney  By 2494 Findlay and Raynor had been robbing trains on New Sydney for nearly five years, drawing the ire of Red Mesa Municipal Enforcement Department marshal Wilkes Butler. During this time he and Raynor sometimes accused each other of cheating the split of their earnings. He and Raynor frequently spent their money at Wicked Wayne's, whose employees always warned them when Marshal Butler was on his way. Findlay frequently slept with exotic dancer and prostitute Daisy, but would often neglect to pay her, only offering promises. In one mission that year, they found a jukebox on the train which Raynor just had to have, and at the vault full of credits they were stopped by Confederate Bureau of Protection of Monies and Valuable Items agent George Woodley. Findlay wanted to shoot him, but Raynor pistol-whipped him instead. Afterward Findlay loaded the jukebox on Raynor's vulture, then led a posse led by Marshal Butler on a \"merry chase\" away from Raynor through dangerous badlands. This forced all but two of the police officers to crash their own vehicles before Findlay himself was forced to bail. Facing two cops and without a vehicle, he simply threatened one, forcing Butler to give up his own vulture, which Findlay promptly stole. He and Raynor quickly reunited. Findlay partied with four women at Wicked Wayne's. He was rudely awakened by \"Cadaver\", a minion of crime lord Scutter O'Banon of Dead Man's Rock. Cadaver offered him a job with O'Banon. When Findlay told Raynor about this, the latter refused, as O'Banon had a poor reputation. Instead, Findlay lined up a job offer at Horley Barton Space Station with the Screaming Skulls. This required them to steal a pair of planet-hoppers. Findlay chose the Red Mesa Municipal Enforcement Department as a source of spaceships. In order to rub this in, he asked Daisy to \"distract\" Marshal Butler as they made off with the ships. At the space station they stole a freighter and its cargo by posing as police officers. They then took the freighter to Hermes, where they met up with the Skulls. Findlay made especial friends with Alli, a warrior woman/torturer. The Skulls offered the duo a job on good terms. Back at Wicked Wayne's, Daisy offered Findlay a \"surprise\". This resulted in him being chained naked to a bed. As she threatened him with a needle filled with knock-out drugs for never paying her, telling him she'd betrayed him to Marshal Butler, Findlay exploded with rage, breaking the cuffs and knocking Daisy out. He then ran, without clothes, into Wayne's and took Raynor with him. They were forced to flee to their secret cave. On the journey, Findlay found some clothes which ill-fit his large frame.Dealing with the Devil  The pair traveled to an orbital scrap yard, Refurbish and Recovery Station 5034, with the aim of stealing junker logs. Station attendant FitzGerald warned them of communication problems. Unfortunately they had fallen into an ambush laid by bounty hunter Ezekiel Daun. The bounty hunter had murdered and tortured their friends from their marine days, Ryk Kydd, Clair Hobarth and Hiram Feek, and used holos of their deaths to unnerve and distract the duo. They were locked into one section of the station. Findlay operated a crane to attack the station while Daun attacked. The crane drew FitzGerald's attention. When he tried to ask what has happening, Daun killed him too. Findlay and Raynor quickly used his corpse to absorb Daun's bullets and even catch his cybernetic arm. Findlay threw Daun into a console as Raynor got FitzGerald's key. Raynor fired up their freighter as Findlay was forced to jump from the bay door through open space into the freighter. Now on the run, Findlay decided to go to Dead Man's Rock and seek Scutter O'Banon's protection. Raynor was notably unenthusiastic about this prospect. At Deadman's Port, Dead Man's Rock, Findlay sold the freighter for an insultingly low bid. As the duo walked through the streets, they were accosted by many children, who pushed them into a trap in an alley. As the children scattered, the freighter purchasers attacked the duo. However, they were in turn ambushed by Cadaver and his own goons and told to go back to Paradise (another town on the planet). They were taken to O'Banon's massive complex where they had their first meeting. Findlay admitted they had sought him for protection from Daun, leaving them in O'Banon's power. For the new few weeks, the duo tried to enjoy life. Findlay especially liked to hang out at the Silver Belle, where the exotic dancers actually took part in a play. Findlay watched enough to memorize the lines and even paid the proprietor to take over the lead for a time. However, Raynor was bothered by being unable to contact Myles Hammond on Shiloh and arranged for a private encrypted communication. O'Banon found out about this and was annoyed, and dispatched Cadaver to make his feelings known. Meanwhile, Raynor learned through the communication that his mother was dying. Raynor and Findlay had an argument over their \"deal\" with O'Banon when Cadaver took a number of thugs to \"greet\" Raynor. The confrontation quickly became a brawl, with Findlay dealing most of the damage himself and rescuing Raynor from a grapple. Cadaver and his thugs were knocked out. O'Banon wanted the duo to carry out an extraction mission at Halcyon. On the way, Raynor insisted he be able to visit his mother on Shiloh. Findlay gave him a day to get his things in order. They met up again at Skyway Starport at Halcyon. There they read the data, which showed they were to make off with Andrew Forrest, a pharmacologist who invented a drug called Utopia. Posing as academic visitors, they infiltrated the facility. They met Forrest in a sealed room, who told them he had written most of the formula down, in order to guarantee he wouldn't be murdered. That's when the power went out. Ezekiel Daun was back. Findlay and Raynor moved away from the door but Forrest wasn't fast enough, and was killed when it exploded. Daun attacked and unleashed his holograms. Raynor started to lose it until Findlay got him to focus on retrieving the drug sample. Raynor tried to pretend to surrender, but Daun saw through it. However, this gave Findlay enough to cut the sample briefcase from Forrest's arm. Raynor through acid in Daun's eye, and the duo fled as the lab blew up behind them. They stole an executive's groundcar and escaped. O'Banon was displeased at not getting the whole formula. Findlay pointed out that O'Banon had failed to protect them, and they came back with the formula and a sample of Utopia. He also expressed his opinion that Dr. Forrest was a liability. He pretended not to have known about the missing element. However, O'Banon was inconsolable and Raynor stormed out of the meeting. Findlay finally agreed with Raynor about O'Banon, but said they needed an escape plan. The duo had another meeting with O'Banon. He complained about Daun having ambushed Cadaver, and about a bank robbery job on Bacchus Moon, a gambling mecca. The bank would hold over 700 million credits for 37 hours, but had a weak point due to a damaged sewer system. They would work with Ash Thompson, one of O'Banon's minions. Findlay said the plan was weak. The duo met with Thompson and his minions, Rafe and Win, at Jack's Spot. Thompson tried to take over the meeting but Findlay wouldn't allow it. Thompson showed off a holo of the Covington Bank building. It had good physical security but one of O'Banon's minions was renting an apartment building above the bank. Worse, the Interstellar Marshals Convention was going on, but Thompson believed this would only make security lazy, and the marshals would be off-duty and partying. Findlay explained how he intended to rob the bank. As the duo left, they paid for a performance from \"Kyttyn\" to Cadaver. The year was now 2495.Capture  The robbery team traveled to Bacchus Moon, but they were secretly pursued by Ezekiel Daun. The duo met up with Findlay's own contact, an Umojan high tech criminal named Jennifer. She and her husband had invented an EMP device and other tools hidden in elaborate costumes for helping with the robbery. Findlay even enjoyed a dance with Jennifer. Unfortunately, he and off-duty marshal Wilkes Butler spotted each other. The duo fled, with Findlay leading the way, and Jennifer headed in a different direction. They lost the cops. The bank robbers planned a \"dry run\" with their equipment. Butler figured out where the robbery would take place and put the bank under a stakeout. As Findlay cased the joint, they met George Woodley, who had been transferred there after losing to the duo. Woodley reached for his comm, and Findlay activated the EMP device. This had the side effect of shorting out Butler's radio. The robbers released mechanical spiders around the crowd, which would poison anyone who tried to move. They closed up the bank and blew the vault, catching Butler's attention. As they stole the money, Woodley told them it was intended for Farm Aid. Findlay had known about this and hadn't told Raynor as he anticipated a negative reaction. Raynor tried to leave the robbery. However Thompson, disgusted by the argument, released the spiders, killing the innocent people. Raynor noticed a spider attacking Woodley and rescued him. Thompson then shot Raynor in the arm. A brawl broke out between the duo and the rest of the robbers. Findlay slammed Thompson into a wall, killing him. During the battle, Findlay punched Win to death while Raynor dealt with Win. They stole Thompson's apartment key, tied up Woodley and left. However, they couldn't go up the stairs or use the elevator. Findlay pulled Raynor up fourteen stories to the apartment, a task made more difficult due to Raynor's injury and Raynor's frequent fainting. Raynor doubted anyone but Findlay could have done it, but they did. The duo made it to the safety of Thompson's apartment, only to find a corpse and numerous holos. Ezekiel Daun was waiting for them. Daun revealed who his employer was\u2014Javier Vanderspool! Raynor was able to shoot Daun down before fainting. When Raynor awoke, Findlay told him the situation. The police were trying to break down the door. There were supposed to be five suits of \"slow-fall hardskins\" which they would use to escape, but in fact, O'Banon had only provided one for Thompson's use. Findlay said he was sorry about lying about the money, but he would still take it. They agreed they'd never cheated each other. Findlay and Raynor had both previously agreed that Findlay had never done a noble thing in his life, but now he would do so. As Raynor escaped, Findlay took on as many as twenty police officers. Butler injured Findlay, who pointed his guns at Butler, only to find he had run out of bullets. Findlay immediately charged Butler, but numerous police officers jumped him. By the end of the fight, almost twenty cops had been injured. Butler put Findlay under arrest... as well as Daun, who had somehow survived. Vanderspool found out about the arrest afterward, and said that Findlay would \"rot\" in prison. Raynor did not forget his friend's sacrifice.New Folsom Prison  Findlay was sentenced to cryonic imprisonment, designated as Convict 626. His rap sheet included convictions for narcotics violations, theft, jailbreak, piracy, grand larceny and murder, and he was a suspect in other murders. He was sentenced to death, but the sentence was later commuted to solitary cryogenic incarceration for life. He was still a prisoner after the fall of the Confederacy, in the era of the Terran Dominion. Eventually, in 2504, Emperor Arcturus Mengsk offered Findlay a deal. In exchange for freedom, Findlay would assassinate Sarah Kerrigan or possibly have him attack Raynor. Findlay agreed and was released, sealed inside his old Confederate CMC armor; only upon completing the task would he be freed from the armor. If he refused to follow his orders, the suit would shut down his major organs. The release was masked as another convict becoming an indentured marine. Findlay could communicate with Mengsk with infrequent encrypted communications. For his part, Findlay initially claimed to have escaped from New Folsom Prison while being transferred and killing a dozen guards with his bare hands. Later Findlay claimed he was freed by the Moebius Foundation, and he was sealed in his armor until his debt to them was repaid.Wings of Liberty  Tychus Findlay found Raynor again in Joeyray's Bar on Mar Sara. The rebel was surprised to see his old friend out of prison. Findlay offered to act as a middle man set up a business deal between the formerly legitimate Moebius Foundation and Raynor's Raiders. The Foundation was willing to pay handsomely for any alien artifacts recovered by the Raiders. As Mengsk had outlawed all trade in alien artifacts and made efforts to procure them for themselves, this meant fighting and stealing from the Dominion. Raynor agreed and after some wrangling allowed Findlay to have thirty percent of the proceeds. Findlay's deal with Mengsk remained a secret from Raynor. The first artifact found was stolen from a Dominion dig site on Mar Sara. Findlay and the Raiders fled the world aboard Hyperion when the zerg invaded, sparking the Second Great War. From the outset, Captain Matt Horner became suspicious and antagonistic towards Findlay, constantly referring to him as \"convict\". Regardless, Findlay directed the Raiders to another artifact on Monlyth, located in a protoss shrine guarded by the Tal'darim. Later, Findlay hacked into ship's database to research his target. The ex-convict was unaware of the Queen of Blades' personal relationship with Raynor. The unauthorized access was discovered by Horner. Horner tolerated Findlay as Raynor continued to vouch for his old friend. In general, Findlay was more concerned with amassing credits than assisting the besieged Koprulu sector. He thought it best if Raynor was less concerned with the Terran Dominion. He pushed Raynor towards cutting corners and acting like a pirate. Still, Findlay did help the Raiders capture the Odin from the Dominion and piloted it in their mission to seize UNN Studios. By this point, Mengsk considered the zerg to be a greater threat than Raynor, even with the damage done to his image, and believed that having Findlay sabotage Raynor's mission would prevent him from killing Kerrigan, the more important goal.Breakdown  Eventually, payday arrived. However, instead of meeting the Foundation at the given coordinates, the Raiders were confronted by Dominion battlecruisers, led by Mengsk's flagship, the Bucephalus. Findlay boarded it with Raynor, believing it to be the only chance they have for the revolution, the pair fighting their way through it. However, it wasn't Emperor Mengsk aboard, but his son, Crown Prince Valerian Mengsk. He was the one behind the Foundation, having sent the Raiders to retrieve the components of a xel'naga artifact that could de-infest Kerrigan. When Raynor agreed to partner up with Valerian to assault Char, a drunken Findlay accused Raynor of being a coward to Rory Swann and fellow crew members inside the cantina. Swann defended Raynor, which caused Findlay to go in a rage, lifting Swann into the air and throwing him down on Kachinsky. Raynor stepped in and the two had a brief fight, Findlay throwing various objects including the jukebox at Raynor, which the commander all evaded. Findlay was defeated when Raynor electrocuted him with a displaced cable. The crew regained their faith in their commander and Findlay was left to fix up the damage he caused. On Char itself, Findlay and Raynor arrived in time to save the wounded General Horace Warfield when zerg overran his position. He stayed in Raynor's command group, keeping the zerg at bay with a gun turret in the \"biggest turkey shoot in the galaxy\". As the battle for Char progressed, Findlay suggested the Raiders target the nydus worms, while Warfield preferred to strike a blow against enemy air support. When Raynor decided to assault the nydus network, as Findlay suggested, Raynor led a small squad including Findlay himself, which excited the ex-convict. Findlay aided the squad with his shredder grenades and was annoyed almost every time Egon Stetmann spoke. The Dominion finished assembling the artifact and presented it to Raynor. Findlay was not keen on putting his faith in such an unproven device. Regardless, the device worked, defeating the zerg assaulting their position. Raynor, Findlay, and a team of Dominion and Raiders marines advanced into the area cleared of the zerg and discovered a human Kerrigan. With Mengsk observing remotely through his suit, and able to contact him using short range communication as his fleet was hidden nearby, Findlay at last had his chance to kill Kerrigan and regain his freedom. The ex-convict finally revealed to his old friend of his debt and his true mission. Mengsk's orders, coming from his helmet, were audible to the troops around him. Raynor shielded Kerrigan from the would-be executioner's bullet, which did nothing but caused a dent in his suit, before turning and shooting Findlay in the face with his revolver, which killed Findlay.Legacy  Findlay's corpse was abandoned by the Raiders in the zerg hive upon their evacuation of Char. After Raynor and Kerrigan retreated to XT39323, Kerrigan expressed remorse that Raynor had to kill his friend in order to save her, stating that maybe he should have let him kill her. Raynor said that they had both made their choices. In 2508, Raynor returned to Joeyray's Bar and reflected on his past. One of the pictures he reflected upon was of Raynor and Tychus in the Heaven's Devils, while Tychus' last words ran through his head.Game Unit StarCraft II  Tychus Findlay's portrait is available on battle.net for players who complete the Artifact Mastery achievement in StarCraft II. Tychus is available as a purchasable announcer.Wings of Liberty  Tychus Findlay appears in Wings of Liberty as an uncontrollable hero in the \"Engine of Destruction\" mission and as a controllable one in the \"Belly of the Beast\" mission. He is ranked as a \"scoundrel\" instead of using traditional ranking methods. He controls the Odin, a powerful thor prototype, in Engine of Destruction (uncontrollable) and Media Blitz.Abilities  Tychus Findlay uses these abilities in \"Belly of the Beast\".Development  Tychus Findlay was also intended to have been given a variant of the Stimpack ability named \"Tychus' Secret Stash\". It is described instead as a mix of rocket fuel, methamphetamine and various chemicals. Only the button remains in the map editor.Co-op Missions  Tychus is available as a commander in Co-op Missions.Heroes of the Storm  Tychus appears as a hero in Heroes of the Storm.Personality and Traits  Findlay's true personality is a matter of debate\u2014some describe Findlay as a scoundrel who would sell his own mother to the Kimeran Pirates for the right sum while others see him as a loyal soldier who risked his life for fellow marines in the Guild Wars. Not even Jim Raynor can say for sure, though believed Findlay to have a \"heart of gold\" due to several friendly gestures Findlay made during the Guild Wars. He has shown xenophobic tendencies and wasn't afraid to speak his mind. Possessing a large ego, and loving nothing more than getting into a fight, he relished combat and was very enthusiastic about piloting the Odin, joyfully unleashing its power on the Dominion. He had an unsubtle combat style, and was known for bearing large firearms; the chain gun was his weapon of choice. In spite of his brutish appearance, Tychus is deceptively intelligent and resourceful, even in hectic situations. While he was an adamant user of tobacco and alcohol, Tychus eschewed harder drugs, not wanting to be beholden to \"anything or anyone.\" Findlay was distrustful of former UED members.Appearance Physical  Findlay massed 165 kilograms (363 pounds). On the knuckles of his left hand there was a tattoo of the word \"PAIN\", as well as a snake around a cross above his index finger. Additionally, he had a scar across his stomach, as well as a tattoo on his back and shoulders which is believed to say \"HEAVEN'S DEVILS\". His shoulders were nearly 40 inches across.Armor  Findlay appeared to have been \"sealed\" into his armor (he wears only prison pants underneath). His armor number was displayed as 435, and a pin-up of Kyla Velassi was painted on the left pauldron. There was a tally mark of 13 on his left wrist and his armor had many other decorations, including a skull and bones insignia (very similar to the insignia of Omega Squadron). On the back of Tychus's leg armor are markings of various zerg creatures. However, Tychus was in cryogenic sleep during first contact with the zerg.Notes Character Development Alternate Histories Merchandise  Blizzard Entertainment announced the Tychus J. Findlay Limited Edition Statue. The polystone collector's item is 18 inches tall and portrays Findlay standing atop a freshly killed hydralisk. The statue was available for pre-order but has since sold out. A Tychus Findlay toy is also available. DC Direct released a 9\" high collectible statue in March 2012. A Sideshow Collectibles Findlay statue was unveiled in November, 2013. It will be released in Q4 2015. A statue of Findlay was on display at Blizzard's GamesCom 2015 booth.Related videos ", "Top Trumps Wiki": "Top Trumps Wiki Main Page About Top Trumps  Top Trumps is a card game that has been going for many years now.

Trumps feature (normally) 30 cards with (normally) 6 stats. They have a subject eg. Marvel Comics. And some trumps are mixed with other card games such as ordinary playing cards and Quartets. Each attribute is followed by a number and usually, highest wins. Some packs of trumps feature descriptions to give information on the certain cards title. All the cards are dealt among the players. There must be at least two players, and at least one card for each player. The starting player (Normally the person to the left of the dealer) selects a category from his or her topmost card and reads out its value. Each other player does the same. The winner of the round is the one with the highest (or otherwise best) value for the chosen item. That player wins the topmost card of all the other players and places them at the bottom of his pile. He then chooses the category for the next round. In the event of a draw, the cards are placed in the centre and a new category is chosen from the next card by the same person as in the previous round. (Some house rules require that the same category be chosen for the round following a draw.) The winner of that round obtains all of the cards in the centre as well as the top card from each player.History  Top Trumps have been going for many years. They originated from the game 'Quartets'. In 1999, Winning Moves took over the world of Top Trumps releasing mainly licensed packs as opposed to the previous companies focusing mainly on unlicensed including fantasy and horror packs. But the world has been changed, everyone after the latest fad such as Power Rangers, Star Wars, The Lord of the Rings and The Simpsons. However there is still hope for the unlicensed classics as Winning Moves still spend some of their time making it. And there's always a chance that other companies will still produce them.External links The Avengers  The Avengers was an STT for Marvel Comic Heroes 3 and was released in 2005. Some of the characters on the card have appeared as individual cards in the pack, but here they make a single card together as a team. \nThe Avengers's stats are impressive, although not the most powerful card in the deck.See Also ", "Rule of Rose Wiki": "Rule of Rose Wiki Characters  List of characters in Rule of Rose.Diana  Diana is one of the orphans at Rose Garden Orphanage and a member of the Red Crayon Aristocrat Club. Ranked Duchess, she has the highest social placement in the Aristocracy, and is also the highest ranking member of the Red Crayon Aristocrat Club, under the Princess of the Red Rose. She is usually seen with Meg and Eleanor. She is very devious and cruel, even toward the other members of the Aristocracy, and could be viewed as a developing psychopath; her first appearance in the game (apart from the opening video) is her apparently beating an animal in a bag to death with a stick. She often adopts a nonchalant attitude and is uncaring of the thoughts of others. She is the object of affection for Meg. She is the oldest member of the Red Crayon Aristocrat Club (when the events of the game actually occurred, instead of in a surreal mental memory). While her age is uncertain, she is estimated to be in the 13-15 range.Biography  It is unclear when Diana arrived at the orphanage, although she had clearly been there for a long while when Jennifer arrived. Diana is the self-proclaimed leader of the Aristocrat Club under the Princess of the Red Rose. Although messages from the Rose Princess are given to Meg, it is Diana who dispenses punishments and rewards on the other members of the Club. Despite her arrogance and cruel tendencies, Diana appears content in following the Princess of the Rose's orders and does not seem to have any desire to take the position herself. Diana learned about the legend of \"Stray Dog\" from Wendy. When Wendy issued a Rule of Rose to the other orphans not to speak to Jennifer to make her feel isolated, Diana obliged by ignoring Jennifer all the time. Wendy's final Rule of Rose to murder Jennifer's pet dog Brown was also partially obliged by Diana. Even after Jennifer violently lashes out at Wendy and shows her hatred towards the other orphans, Diana remains stoic. Diana, along with the other orphans, chooses to elect Jennifer as their new Princess of the Red Rose, but shortly afterwards is murdered by Gregory M. Wilson as \"Stray Dog\" during the orphanage massacre.Rule of Rose  Diana appears as a mental construct, as the game is a re-enactment of Jennifer's childhood set in her adult mind. As such, Diana is akin to a dream character, although from a real world perspective, there is a theory that posits figures in dreams are the true selves of the deceased, and it is unknown if the game's writers had this theory in mind. Diana is first seen beating something in a bag with a stick, perhaps Brown or a live animal. Diana is among the rest of the orphans who abduct Jennifer and take her to the airship. On the airship, Diana is seen in various areas, mainly in the Sector 10 Crew Cabin sitting at the table. She is also seen in the Aristocrat Club meeting area where she attends the meetings and watches the punishments take place. Her chapter is \"The Mermaid Princess\", which is also shared with Clara. Hoffman's koi goes missing. It is implied Eleanor and Meg took Hoffman's koi, sliced it in half, combined it with a doll to make the \"Mermaid Doll\" as mermaids do not really exist, and donated it as the Monthly Gift. Diana was in charge of caring for Hoffman's koi, so she was blamed by Hoffman. Diana searches for it, but her absence makes him suspect her of taking it. After the defeat of the Mermaid Princess, Hoffman interrogated Diana about his koi to no avail. While interrogating a crying Diana, Hoffman began stroking her body suggestively and could be perceived as crossing the line on how much an adult should touch a child. When he leaves the room, Diana is clearly disgusted by his touch, calling it 'disgusting'. Diana then blames Jennifer for the whole incident. In response for appearing bad in front of Hoffman, Diana took out her anger at getting into trouble on Jennifer, smearing her face with a dirty rag.Personality  Jennifer thought Diana was the prettiest and most \"mature\" of the Aristocrats, although Jennifer likely means mature in the physical aspect, as Diana could be perceived as immature behaviorally, as she is a terrible role model for the younger children of the orphanage. Diana could be viewed as a developing psychopath who does not seem to care about the emotions of others, or the welfare or suffering of animals. It is also implied that Diana has been involved in acts of abuse, torture and cruelty against animals. She is seen beating something in a bag, involved with the death of a rat, was responsible for killing Eleanor's bird, condoned the killing of Brown, and may have killed Wendy's rabbit Peter. Diana is very devious and a troublemaker, which is shown by the way she tricks others. She has badmouthed Eleanor and Meg, though she pretends to like them when she is in their presence. She once pulled a prank on Eleanor by stealing and killing her red bird. Afterwards, she and Meg made a bet to see if she would cry or get furious, which ended up with both of them losing since Eleanor didn't get angry or cry. Her cruelty can be shown again when she undertook another prank during September. After Meg gave her a love letter, Diana ripped it in half and stuffed it into a stuffed goat doll. When Meg learned of what had become of her letter, Meg only cried in Diana's arms, believing Jennifer did it. Diana appears to have a strong dislike for Jennifer, likely due to the whole koi incident, despite that Jennifer was wrongfully blamed and she was actually innocent. Diana looks for any opportunity to bully her, torment her, make her feel terrible, and ruin her self-esteem with insults. However, when Jennifer is declared the new Rose princess, Diana asks for Jennifer's forgiveness for her previous behavior and is willing to follow Jennifer's orders, although it could be argued her apology does not seem entirely sincere. Diana is proud, selfish and sadistic in personality, often looking forward to punishing people or hurting them mentally as seen when Jennifer gave the Aristocrats the gift of a butterfly and she shouted that it was worth nothing. Diana even goes as far as to stand up on a chair for the sake of being able to look down upon Jennifer and make her feel inferior. Diana despises adults, and it is shown in how she reacts when Hoffman treats her suggestively. Ironically, Diana actually dreams of becoming an adult, however, there were times when she was afraid of growing up as well and growing up too fast. Jennifer spoke poorly of her, saying that Diana was trapped by her own ideals. Diana liked to spend large amounts of time sitting in one of the cells in the basement, thinking about growing up. Diana apparently wanted to be beautiful and pure but was self-conscious in believing that every day she separated from her ideal self. Most likely, her fears about losing her ideal self and not growing up into the adult she wanted to stemmed from Hoffman's possible growing sexual interest in her and her revulsion at this. It is unclear if Diana ever had lesbian feelings for Meg which turned from love to annoyance, or if Diana simply pretended to have them the entire time in order to manipulate Meg. Despite her dislike for Meg, Diana is shown in the opening movie first causing Meg to prick her finger on an offered rose before Diana sucks on it, suggestively. This alludes to Meg's feelings for Diana, Diana's awareness of this, as well as Diana's compulsion to be cruel to others and put herself in a position of control over them. It also suggests Diana might be more familiar with sexuality, possibly at the hands of Hoffman, and uses this knowledge to further manipulate and control Meg.Etymology  The name \"Diana\" probably derived from an old Indo-European root meaning \"heavenly, divine\", related to dyeus (Zeus). Diana was a Roman goddess of the moon, hunting, forests, and childbirth, often identified with the Greek goddess Artemis. This reflects Diana's vain, proud attitude and the fact she thinks she is more important than everyone else. In addition, Diana/Artemis was the goddess of virgins and maidens, and legends of her chastity are prominent in Roman/Greek myth. She preferred hunting and venturing into the woods to marrying and settling down to have children as many of the other goddesses did. This could reflect Diana in the game's own desire to remain 'pure'. It could also be seen as an ironic name, as Diana was the most sexually aware of the children. There are also strong implications that Hoffman had started violating her the same way he had been doing to Clara. The Greek myth of Diana states that while the goddess Diana was bathing naked in the forest with her escort nymphs, she is discovered by a hunter named Actaeon. Furious and humiliated, she transforms him into a deer before he escapes into the forest, where he is killed by his fellow hunters. This reflects Diana's relationship with Hoffman, who seemingly violates her on a regular basis, leaving her feeling embarrassed and vengeful. As such, she sends the other girls to spy on Hoffman, supposedly looking for opportunities to get back at him. Hoffman's boss form can then be taken as a manifestation of one of Diana's revenge fantasies. It is also worth noting that Diana's name, when spoken, begins with \"die\". If language is viewed from a more abstract perspective that affects the subconscious, Diana can be seen as someone associated with death, which may refer to her acts of animal cruelty. Her attitude towards Jennifer can be seen as killing Jennifer \"inside\".Quotes Trivia Jennifer  Jennifer is the main protagonist of Rule of Rose. Very little is initially known about her in the beginning of the game, other than that she is a young woman who is described by the unseen narrator as a \"poor unlucky girl\". At 19, she is still a teenager, although her teen years are almost over and she is entering adulthood. Jennifer is abducted while exploring the seemingly abandoned Rose Garden Orphanage, and subsequently trapped on a surreal airship by a ragtag mob of disobedient orphaned children known as the Red Crayon Aristocrat Club who force her to do their commands under the threat of death. If the player did not catch it by the end of the game, it is revealed that Jennifer is actually lost inside her dark, disturbing and fractured amnesiac childhood memories in a psychologically-damaged version of her mental hell full of monsters and bullying. Rule of Rose is focused on Jennifer's stay at Rose Garden Orphanage and her post-traumatic stress disorder, and is focused on Jennifer remembering, processing, comprehending, understanding and accepting the suffering she experienced as a child. Her Social Rank in the Red Crayon Aristocrat Club is the lowest in the aristocracy: Beggar, and later, Irritating.Personality  Jennifer is a demure, passive, gloomy and scared soft-spoken young woman who believes herself to be a coward. Jennifer speaks very little and distances herself from her own emotions in an attempt to distance herself from others in turn. She is the type who is not very talkative and tends to only speak when necessary or when she has something she really wants to say, making her thoughts to the player often a mystery, making her a bit similar to Eleanor. After discovering the truth about her backstory, it is revealed that Jennifer's behavior during the game is the result of a teenager processing her traumatic and painful memories. As such, Jennifer is emotionally-stunted. She seems weak and can be easily pushed about and ordered by others, although this is understandable considering the situation she is forced in. If Jennifer disobeys and misbehaves, she will be killed, as mentioned by the prince; as a result, she is submissive and lets herself be bullied and tortured by the other ten members of the Red Crayon Aristocrat Club. In addition, one must also consider the time period Rule of Rose is set in and the expectations of women and their behavior (very outspoken women were frowned down upon). Despite Jennifer's quiet, stoic demeanor, she is also exceptionally kind, good natured, and caring. She never bears any ill will towards her tormentors - she instead puts on an adult, mature, emotionally repressed front in order to cope with her fears and trauma instead of stooping to the level of her fellow orphans. In addition, the game is set in Jennifer's mind and Jennifer was a child during the events of the game and it is unreasonable to expect a little girl to be able to stand up to a mob of other children, especially since some of them, like Diana, were older than her and Jennifer was the \"new girl\" at the orphanage. Jennifer's lack of strength and inability to stand up for herself and being unable to say \"no\" to evil, wrongdoings and injustice led to Brown's death. This eventually taught her an important lesson about asserting her true feelings, confronting bullies and why they should be stopped instead of ignored, and refusing to accept abuse. However, she is actually very determined and loyal, being able to endure the bullying and punishments. In this regard, she can be viewed as strong. By the end of the game, Jennifer eventually finds the courage to stand up for herself. When Jennifer was a child, she was the orphan who was most aware of her surroundings. She seemed caring and thoughtful of the others. Even when the other orphans bullied her, she wouldn't retaliate. She is loyal to her friends, including Wendy and Brown, and even to those who do not like her, such as the Aristocracy and the adults in the orphanage, fulfilling their orders and demands. Jennifer states that she thought of herself as a grown-up compared to the other orphans, when, in reality, she was a child like the rest of them. All of the children, except for Wendy, portrayed her as \"filth\" and called her \"Filthy Jennifer.\" Ironically, Jennifer did the orphan's laundry. Hoffman didn't stop their bullying, even calling Jennifer a \"filthy wretch\" when he scolded her in his office. Hoffman's dislike of Jennifer was likely because she was often late and didn't care about being scolded for not doing her assigned chores. Additionally, Hoffman notes in his diary that it was after Jennifer's arrival that the other orphans began to act up uncontrollably. The maid Martha Carol was not fond of Jennifer either, but helped teach Jennifer how to clean.Biography  Jennifer was born in England around the year 1921. In June 1929, Jennifer and her parents were traveling on an luxury airship headed toward India from Cardington, however, the airship crashed and everyone on the airship, except Jennifer, died. Jennifer claims she lost her memories, but it is unknown which memories she lost. The media presumed that everyone on the airship was dead. However, Jennifer miraculously survived and, before the ruins of the airship were found by the police, a lonely pea farmer named Gregory M. Wilson found her and kidnapped her. For about half a year, Gregory held her captive in the basement of his rural house located on the outskirts of Cardington, believing she was his son Joshua, even calling her by 'Joshua'. It is implied he made her dress in Joshua's clothing and cut her hair. He would also read her plenty of storybooks he wrote himself, and they would usually contain dark and sadistic plots. Gregory and Jennifer lived in poverty. Gregory was depressed, suicidal, and alcoholic, and seems to have become delusional after the death of his son, the real Joshua. Jennifer, who had lost her memory, pitied him and empathized with him, though he wouldn't allow her to leave. In November 1929, a young girl named Wendy, a resident of the nearby Rose Garden Orphanage, saw Jennifer through the window of Gregory's basement. The two began exchanging letters (presumably through a crack in the window) and two became friends and then lovers. Eventually, in the spring of 1930, Jennifer fled Gregory's house with Wendy's help and they went to the orphanage. Just before they did, Wendy gave Jennifer her rose brooch in exchange for a stuffed bear. The orphanage accepted Jennifer, and she was put under the care of Hoffman, Martha Carol, and Clara. Jennifer also became involved with the Red Crayon Aristocrat Club, and became acquainted with the orphans. Jennifer states that she \"couldn't bear\" playing airship with the other children as an airship's fatal crash caused the ill fate of her parents. Although Jennifer got along with Wendy the most, she also got along with Amanda, and there are implications she and Meg respected each other, and that Jennifer and Meg linked the friend circles with Diana and Eleanor. Jennifer and Susan were friendly, while Olivia is implied to have been mean. In July 1930, Jennifer found a puppy and named him Brown, and decided to take care of him. Jennifer kept Brown in a shed located close to the orphanage. When Wendy found out about Jennifer's love for Brown, she became jealous, angry and hateful, especially when Jennifer spent more time with Brown instead of her. Jennifer had broken the promise she had made with Wendy known as the Rule of Rose; a pledge of everlasting true love. Even though Wendy despised Jennifer, she still believed that Jennifer would come back to her. Unfortunately for Wendy, Jennifer never did stop caring for Brown. The Aristocrats began to bully Jennifer in several ways (some of these are implied), such as: Finally, in November 1930, Wendy ordered that Jennifer either let the Aristocrats kill Brown or die in his stead, hoping to force Jennifer to come back. Brown was killed by the Aristocracy who invited Jennifer to see her dog's body. This backfired when Jennifer, enraged, slapped Wendy to the floor in front of the other girls and shouted how much she hated Wendy, declaring her hate for Wendy and the club, claiming that they are the opposite of aristocrats and that she hates them all. Wendy, humiliated and devastated, fled the room in tears. Later, Wendy was demoted and Jennifer was invited to become the new Princess of the Red Rose by the other members. Deranged and distraught, Wendy manipulated a mentally unstable Gregory as Stray Dog to come to the orphanage in December of 1930, in order to prove to them that Stray Dog was real, and to scare them for demoting her. However, Gregory ultimately killed everyone but Jennifer and Wendy. After realizing the intended consequences of her actions, Wendy apologized to Jennifer before she was pulled into the orphanage by Stray Dog and killed too. Gregory stopped himself from killing Jennifer during his rampage on the orphanage. When he came to his senses, he apologized to Jennifer, still convinced that she was Joshua, and completes suicides with his own pistol. It was initially reported by the media that there were no survivors, however, an officer named Anthony Dolittle found Jennifer at the crime scene. It was then discovered that Jennifer was also the sole survivor of the airship accident that occurred a year and a half ago, and the media went into a frenzy and focused less on the orphanage murders until they were forgotten. What happened in Jennifer's life afterwards remains a mystery. At 19 years old, Jennifer still carries Wendy's rose brooch with her. Jennifer became so traumatized that she repressed the memories of her childhood. Sometime later, it is presumed that Jennifer either fell asleep on a park bench or while taking a bus trip and the memories of her childhood slowly began coming back. This is when Rule of Rose begins, and Jennifer relives her childhood in the form of her older self, with Wendy disguised as Joshua acting as her guide.Rule of Rose  In the dead of night, Jennifer sleeps at the back of a bus traveling along a rural country road. At the front of the bus, a young boy sits, reading a handmade storybook. He awakens her and begs her to read the rest of story to him. Jennifer takes the book, but to her surprise, most of the pages are blank. The bus comes to a stop and the boy suddenly runs out of the bus and down the road. Jennifer yells for him to wait, and follows the boy off the bus which, immediately after, speeds away, leaving Jennifer all by herself. The events of Rule of Rose begin and Jennifer explores her fragmented childhood memories. She is constantly attacked by monstrous Imps. The Imps attempt to stop Jennifer from recalling her lost memories. They are a hallucinations of Jennifer's; they represent her fear of discovering the truth. Jennifer weak heart is what attracted them. Throughout the game, the narrator constantly refers to Jennifer as a \"girl\", rather then a woman. This subtle choice of wording can be seen as foreshadowing to the player that Jennifer was a child when the events of the game occurred. At the end of the game, Jennifer finally remembers that Gregory was responsible for the orphanage massacre. If Jennifer kills Gregory through fighting, then the game ends on an ominous note. However, if the player gives Gregory his gun, he kills himself with it. Jennifer and Brown are then seen running into a bright portal, returning to an earlier time in Jennifer's memory. The player can explore the \"Once Upon a Time\" chapter as child Jennifer, which is set in her memories, and a happier time before the massacre. Jennifer fully remembers her past, including her interactions with Hoffman, Martha, Clara, and the rest of the orphans. Jennifer decides to lock away her memories, including Wendy and Brown, deep within her mind so that she will never forget them until her death. In the shed, Jennifer creates a Bucket Knight which symbolizes that she is creating a save point so that she will never forget Brown and can return to her memory of him in her mind.Etymology  The name Jennifer is a Cornish form of the Welsh name Gwenhwyfar which is composed of the elements gwen meaning \"fair, white\" and hwyfar meaning \"smooth.\" These characteristics can refer to Jennifer's physical looks and her gentle personality. The \"white\" meaning also appears in Wendy's name. Another form of Gwenhwyfar is the French name Guinevere. In Arthurian legend, Guinevere was the wife of King Arthur. She engaged in an adulterous affair with Sir Lancelot and her betrayal of her husband with Mordred prompted the Battle of Camlann, which led to the deaths of both Mordred and Arthur. This legend reflects Jennifer's \"cheating\" on her friendship with Wendy when she starts to turn her attention to Brown, which later brings the death of Brown, Wendy, and the other children.Quotes  W & J Letters Rule of Rose Once Upon A TimeTrivia Wendy  Wendy is a character in Rule of Rose. She is introduced as a sweet and kind girl who is the only one pleasant to Jennifer, and could be thought of as Jennifer's childhood girlfriend due to scenes of them kissing each other and telling each other they love each other. However, it is eventually revealed she has a secret darker side and she is arguably the main antagonist, and she is the reason behind much of Jennifer's suffering. The secret founder of the Red Crayon Aristocrat Club, Wendy is perhaps the most sinister and cruelest club member of them all. Wendy uses her innocent appearance to her advantage in order to avoid suspicion. Wendy is a frail sickly child who often coughs because of her unspecified sickness. She is often bedridden and is known as the \"girl who always lays in her bed\" or, to older Jennifer, as \"The Lonely Princess.\"Biography  A lot of Wendy's early history is unknown, except that she is an orphan at Rose Garden Orphanage. In November 1929, Wendy explored the rural area outside of the orphanage when she found \"The Gingerbread House\" where Gregory M. Wilson lived. She saw a basement window, and inside, saw what appeared to be a boy, who was actually Jennifer dressed in Joshua's clothing. She started to pass notes through the window, presumably through a crack in the window, back and forth between herself and Jennifer, while eventually Jennifer revealed herself to be a girl. She and Wendy were such close friends that they nicknamed each other Prince and Princess, and Jennifer did not mind being the Prince. One night (implied to be January 28, 1930), Wendy helped Jennifer escape the house and move into the orphanage. Just before leaving Gregory's house, she took his gun in a bag. She gave Jennifer her rose brooch in exchange for a stuffed bear. Wendy was the girl who started the Stray Dog rumors, leading to the foundation of the Red Crayon Aristocrat Club. She probably began it because she was bedridden and lonely, and if other children listened to her, she could receive attention. After the incident when she rescued Jennifer, she told everyone in the orphanage the rumors about how Stray Dog would kidnap children. Due to the fright and curiosity that it caused them, they allowed her to become the Princess of the Red Rose. Due to Wendy being bedridden most of time, she was substituted with a doll resembling her. Jennifer eventually found another companion - an abandoned puppy she later named Brown. Wendy became increasingly jealous because Jennifer gradually spent more time with Brown instead of Wendy, apparently considering Brown to be nothing more than a filthy animal. In a fit of rage, Wendy demanded that all of the orphanage belittle Jennifer and treat her poorly, so that she would eventually forget Brown and return to her side. This failed, however, so Wendy demanded that they kill Brown as a last resort. In late November 1930, When Brown was killed and Wendy revealed herself to Jennifer as the Princess of the Red Rose, Jennifer slapped Wendy to the ground, telling her to \"go away!\" and swearing to never forgive her. Heartbroken and humiliated, Wendy ran out the room in tears. Wendy was dethroned from the Aristocracy, and Jennifer became the new Princess of the Red Rose. On December 20, 1930, Wendy returned to the orphanage disguised as Joshua. Everyone saw Wendy outside, and the orphans of the home ran outside to presumably mock her. However, Wendy had a mentally unstable Gregory M. Wilson (Stray Dog) with her, whom she had trained to act like an animal and obey her orders. Stray Dog kills all of the orphans, excluding Jennifer who was still inside. It is likely that Wendy simply wanted to prove to the orphans Stray Dog as real and that she never intended for him to murder everyone, since Wendy says, \"I brought Stray Dog here... But, I... I...\" with a sad expression when she learns the orphans died. After Jennifer saved herself from Stray Dog, she made it outside, where Wendy apologized in tears, and handed Jennifer the gun she took from Gregory's home. After that, Gregory noticed that the one imitating Joshua was not actually his son and dragged her inside the orphanage, killing her.Rule of Rose  Years after the orphanage massacre, Jennifer has grown up but has forgotten her childhood memories. She apparently still carries Wendy's rose brooch with her. Since the game is set in Jennifer's mind and much of it is a re-enactment of Jennifer's childhood memories, the Wendy seen in the game is akin to a dream character, although from a real world perspective, there is a theory that posits figures in dreams are the true selves of the deceased, and it is unknown if the game's writers had this theory in mind. \"Wendy\" is first seen on the airship feeding the rabbits (excluding Wendy-dressed-as-Joshua, who is seen at the very beginning of the game). Caring for the rabbits may be one of the chores given to her by Martha Carol, or merely one of her favorite hobbies. Peter was Wendy's rabbit, and she obtained him around the same time Jennifer found Brown, but Wendy eventually had to give Peter away. In the \"Sir Peter\" chapter, Peter goes missing and it is up to Jennifer to find him. She does so, and Wendy (as the Princess of the Red Rose) rewards Jennifer. In the \"Gingerbread House\" chapter, which is Jennifer reliving her memories of living with Gregory, Jennifer becomes locked in Gregory's basement. Wendy, seeing Jennifer in Joshua's room, sneaks into the house and unlocks the door. Jennifer meets with Wendy, and just before they make their escape, Wendy swipes Gregory's pistol. In the rose garden, Jennifer exchanges stuffed bear she found inside Gregory's house with Wendy's rose brooch. Wendy then names the bear Joshua. In the \"Rag Princess Sews\" chapter, Amanda accuses Wendy of stealing Joshua the bear. In Wendy's room, Jennifer finds her lying on the floor, out of bed. Helping her back into bed, Wendy reveals that the Aristocrats came and accused her of stealing Joshua the bear. Since Wendy is \"Joshua\", this is true in a way. In \"The Funeral\" chapter, when the orphanage becomes swarmed with Imps, Jennifer sees Wendy through a window. The door to the courtyard is shut and after defeating various types of Imps scattered through the orphanage, the door becomes unlocked. In the courtyard, Wendy tells Jennifer that an important Aristocrat Club meeting is about to take place. Jennifer reads the storybook entitled \"The Funeral\", and when she is finished, she realizes that Brown and Wendy have disappeared. In the club room, Jennifer has a hallucination of Brown's corpse. The Aristocrats appear, and Wendy reveals to Jennifer that she is the Princess of the Red Rose. Amanda whispers into Jennifer's ear that Brown is dead and points towards a bloodied sack with a large lump inside. Jennifer, fueled with rage, slaps Wendy several times, calling her a liar and vows to never forgive her. Jennifer then stands up to the Aristocrats, calling them monsters for siding with Wendy, and throws her rose brooch towards them. Wendy, humiliated and heartbroken, runs out the room sobbing. In the \"Stray Dog and the Lying Princess\", Susan sees Wendy outside the orphanage window. The girls, prepared to go outside and ridicule Wendy, head outside the orphanage. Jennifer, however, decides to stay inside. This is when Stray Dog, who came to the orphanage with Wendy, kills everyone. Jennifer hears screaming outside and silently stands in fear of what to do. Suddenly, the front door to the orphanage opens. Joshua and Gregory are there, and Gregory is now \"Stray Dog\". Joshua sets him to attack Jennifer and after a battle, Brown (symbolically making her stronger) aids Jennifer. After defeating Gregory, Jennifer proceeds outside to find Joshua. Joshua reveals to Jennifer that he is actually Wendy, and she tells Jennifer that she brought Stray Dog for her own selfish reasons. Wendy apologizes and gives Jennifer Gregory's gun. Gregory, still alive, kills Wendy and faces Jennifer once more. In the \"Once Upon a Time\" chapter, Jennifer seems to feel sorry for Wendy, stating that she was \"always so lonely\". In the end, she locks Wendy inside her memories, as she does Brown and the rest of the children of the orphanage, remembering her for the good times they had together, rather than her wrongdoings.Personality  Wendy is initially seen as admirable, sweet and caring, and is the only one who is nice to Jennifer - at least for a while. She appears innocent because of her gentle and frail appearance, yet there is a dark side to her that makes her cruel and secretive, and she is incredibly two-faced. Wendy and Jennifer were the best of friends. Wendy had to stay in the sick room due to her frail health, which was why she was always lonely and had few friends. This caused her to be unhealthily obsessed and infatuated with Jennifer, to the point of wanting no one to have Jennifer's attention but herself. It also likely contributed to her attention-seeking personality. Wendy can be perceived as extremely possessive, insecure, and envious. This is first shown when young Jennifer introduces Brown to her. Wendy hides her jealousy and anger over Jennifer's attachment to the dog, and instead, temporarily accepts it and considers the dog of no importance. Despite the jealousy that festered inside of her, Wendy may be viewed as misguided, overprotective, and clingy; rather than truly evil and malevolent. Her over-protectiveness may have even been a result of her losing something very important in her life, although apart from being an orphan, there is nothing in the game to suggest this. Wendy seems very desperate for love and affection, possibly due to being an orphan with no sources of love in her life. Due to how envious Wendy becomes of Brown, it is heavily implied that Wendy was in love with Jennifer, due to Jennifer calling herself Joshua when they first met and naming herself Wendy's prince and also making an \"everlasting love\" pact with one another. It isn't known however if Jennifer felt the same way for Wendy. Wendy's feelings may also be an overreaction to her loneliness, rather than being truly in love or her having an innocent wish of true friendship and companionship.Etymology  The name Wendy was a created name in J. M. Barrie's 1904 play Peter Pan. It was from the nickname \"fwendy\" (friend), given to the author by a young friend. This can relate to the friendship between Wendy and Jennifer, and - ironically - her unfriendly behavior when Brown comes along. Likewise, Jennifer can be seen as symbolic of Peter Pan (for more info, see Jennifer's Trivia). Wendy also relates to the Welsh name Gwendolen, meaning \"white, fair, blessed.\" These elements can relate to her physical looks, or it could be in reference to her sinful, cruel behavior in the game compared to her innocent appearance. The \"white\" meaning also appears in Jennifer's name.Quotes  W & J Letters Rule of RoseTrivia See also Rule of Rose  Rule of Rose is a\u00a0psychological survival horror video game for the PlayStation 2. It was developed by Punchline and published by Sony\u00a0on January 19, 2006 in Japan, by Atlus\u00a0on September 12, 2006 in North America and by 505 Games\u00a0on November 3, 2006 in Europe (excluding the United Kingdom). Despite that the story of Rule of Rose is set in the United Kingdom, the game was banned in the United Kingdom due to controversy and misinformation - some officials claimed that the purpose of the game is to \"rape, beat up and kill a little girl\", which is untrue, but the controversy was enough to ban it. It was still released in the rest of Europe with a PEGI rating of 16+, a year lower than the ESRB \"mature\" rating of 17+.Plot  Rule of Rose is set in 1930 in the rural Cardington, Bedfordshire, England, a few years before World War II broke out. The game tells the story of a 19-year-old young woman named Jennifer, whose parents were killed in a tragic airship accident. During a bus ride along a moonlit road, Jennifer is awakened by a mysterious boy who presents her with a storybook. The storybook is blank and the boy runs away off the bus. Jennifer follows him to the Rose Garden Orphanage, located in a remote portion of the countryside. Jennifer discovers the orphanage to be a dilapidated building with no adults around and a ragtag mob of orphaned children who call themselves the Red Crayon Aristocrat Club. The demented residents of Rose Garden kidnap Jennifer and take her into an impossibly large zeppelin filled with monstrous creatures called Imps, on a meandering course for a distant land. Jennifer ends up being forced into the Aristocracy as part of their \"lower class\". On the airship, Jennifer saves a dog who was bound by rope by the Aristocracy and names him Brown. With the help of her new canine companion, Jennifer must find valuable gifts for the Aristocracy in order to survive, or suffer death for her insolence. Throughout the game, Jennifer recovers the forgotten memories of her childhood and remembers the people she knew at the orphanage. Because the plot is based on Jennifer's fragmented memories alone, what really happened is not always obvious to the player due to the fact that Jennifer's memory can alter or distort events and dates. The fact that the plot is only based on Jennifer's perspective also stops the player from seeing all sides of the story as well. A lot of what happened before, during and after the events of the game is not revealed, although many hints are given. The player must \"connect the dots\" and infer the story through dialogue, memos, notes, visual cues, etc.Endings  Rule of Rose has two possible endings, but it is unknown which one of them is canon. There is only one factor which decides the ending: whether or not Jennifer kills Stray Dog through giving him a revolver (leading to the Good Ending), or killing Stray Dog through regular combat means.Themes  Rule of Rose is a game very much carried by its themes, many of which can be seen as distressing and taboo for video games at the time of the game's release in 2006. Being a horror game, it is designed to make the player feel uncomfortable. Rule of Rose touches upon topics such as human indifference towards animal suffering, animal cruelty, traumatic childhood memories, bullying and peer pressure, mental disorders and psychology, rankism and societal inequality, death, addiction (alcoholism and smoking), gun violence, murder, suicide, death, grief and coping with loss, and implied cannibalism. There are also some minor sexual themes and implied rape, but nothing explicit is seen. Due to the heavy psychological themes which feature children, the game focuses on how children grow up, what sort of experiences they may have, and how this can factor into their development. This involves what activities children do to cope with boredom, how children behave and influence other children, how children differentiate between \"friend\" \"enemy\" \"role model\", trauma, maturity, the development of sociopathy and psychopathy, as well as how empathy can either grow or become repressed, whether it be towards other people or animals. One of the dynamics in the game also revolves around how children learn they have the ability to create and destroy, and what consequences may occur. One of the characters in the game, Thomas, is also implied to have some sort of neurological disorder such as autism, and he is portrayed as a lonely child in a somewhat sympathetic way. Rule of Rose is a dark and twisted coming-of-age story, in this case, Jennifer's. The game is centered on Jennifer's point as view, coming to terms with her forgotten past and childhood traumas. The morals of the story, in regards to Jennifer, include the importance of keeping promises, as well as questioning authority and the dangers of being passive. The game occurred because Jennifer ignored her bullies as a child, instead of seeking more proactive ways to deal with it, such as finding help from adults. One theme is the difference between a child's and an adult's way of thinking and how children might treat adults if they were given power over them. Players are unable to prevent Jennifer from being bullied by orphaned children who lack parental restraint. One theme is how people, especially children and girls, can be two-faced and hide under the guise of innocence. The children portrayed in Rule of Rose are extremely sadistic, savage and cruel, and wear innocent facades when adults are around. This certainly applies to Wendy. Vice-versa, the adults in Rule of Rose also have their own facades around children. There is a noticeable gender slant in the game as most of the cast are girls. This is because the developers wanted an unpredictability in the world based on the mysterious nature of girls, as they felt that boys are more simplistic in relationships, while girls tend to hold onto grudges longer, be more into psychological bullying than physical bullying, etc.[4] Xavier and Nicholas are often seen swordfighting, adding a contrast to the differences in rivalry between how the boys and girls in the game are portrayed. Despite the game's darker themes, one of the major themes of Rule of Rose is the concept of love and the exploration of love. Apart from the love between couples, the game also includes the love between parent and child (i.e. Gregory and Joshua), and even the love that comes with friendship; in the \"Once Upon a Time\" chapter, Jennifer remembers a lot of her childhood memories and the camaraderie with the other children she had at the orphanage. There are some LGBT themes, as there is implied lesbianism between Diana and Meg, and Jennifer and Wendy, and the aforementioned implications of sexuality. A theme is how attachment to one thing can bring out the worst in people. This certainly applies to the theme of unhealthy love and the concept of unhealthy obsessive infatuation. One facet of the game's story is the recurring theme of bondage and constraint. The game makes heavy use of rope symbolism, with Jennifer and Brown being tied up several times throughout the story. Additionally every single enemy in the game besides two (three excluding promotional material) feature rope in their design, as does every single boss in the game. This is probably symbolic that the characters are figuratively constrained and tied down by something major. As the player progresses through the game, the environments become more and more covered in rope. This is likely representative of how the story treats the orphanage like a prison for its residents, \"tying\" everybody together against their will. The goal of the game was to make it so that depending on the player's personality, they will walk way with different feelings. However, the developers really wanted the player to think about not just the game, but to take the ideas from the game into their everyday life. The developers wanted the player to think while playing, emphasizing Rule of Rose isn't designed to be mindless entertainment. Although the game may appear similar to other games in the survival horror genre at first glance, the developers insist it's not.Gameplay  Rule of Rose plays like a typical survival horror game. Jennifer explores the environments and searches for items around the airship, furthering the plot by accomplishing tasks, solving puzzles, as well as encountering random enemy battles and a few bosses. The player, as Jennifer, is forced to find the monthly gift of the chapter to appease the Aristocracy and donate it to the Gift Box, or die. Jennifer's health is displayed as a red line in the inventory screen, and after every chapter, her health bar will automatically replenish. In order to survive her hellish predicament, Jennifer must locate health items, such as lollipops, candy and scones, which heal varying amounts of health. After every chapter, the player must drop unneeded items in the inventory to make space for more as there are only 12 slots. If the player becomes lost during the game and doesn't know what to do next, they can ask a Bucket Knight for clues which also act as save points.Combat  Jennifer does not have access to weapons like grenade launchers and machine guns because it does not make sense from a tonal and narrative perspective, and the developers wanted the player to feel as helpless and weak as Jennifer. As such, combat is almost exclusively melee with a variety of improvised makeshift weapons available such as a dessert fork, a knife and a pipe. Since Jennifer is scared and timid, even to the point where she covers her face in fear while attacking, her melee attacks are neither powerful nor very long-ranged. Due to this, Jennifer needs to be close to attack enemies and may become seriously injured, especially against large groups of Imps. Jennifer is also very vulnerable and can easily die after a few hits, especially after being stunned by hoards. As such, it is recommended to ignore enemies when possible, although there are times (such as Jennifer being locked in a room, or during boss battles) where Jennifer must fight. The only ranged weapons are the Revolver and Gregory's Gun: a simple handgun which isn't achieved until the final battle against Stray Dog. The pistol gives Jennifer a longer-range and no real need to get close to the boss unless needed.Brown and item hunting  Early in the game, Jennifer encounters her dog Brown, who accompanies her and will respond to commands such as tracking items by scent, being commanded to 'stay' and being called to Jennifer's side. Brown cannot attack enemies (except for Hoffman's boss fight in which he can bite his leg three times), but can growl, which distracts some Imps and bosses, allowing Jennifer to retreat or attack without retaliation. He can be injured to the point of collapsing, causing him to stop distracting enemies or tracking an item. Brown's ability to locate items is an important part of the game. The same system allows Jennifer to find health restoratives and other items which, while not essential to complete the game, can help Jennifer and unlock hidden items. Animal Bones and meat can be used to restore Brown's health if he becomes injured. Other items, such as marbles and ribbons, have no immediate use, but may be traded with the Gift Box to obtain food, unlockable items and weapons. Finding items is very much like a treasure hunt: the player selects an item from the inventory for Brown to locate another, which is then connected to the 'find' command until changed or removed. Brown will lead Jennifer through the environments, scratching at doors in his way for Jennifer to open. Most items are hidden and must be uncovered by Brown, though the player can choose to avoid searching for these items in order to progress quickly.Music  The musical score was composed by Yutaka Minobe, who also composed the music of Skies of Arcadia and some tracks from the Panzer Dragoon Orta soundtrack. The entire score was created without electronic instruments - most of the music was produced by musicians, the Hiroshi Murayama Trio, using pianos and string instruments such as violins and cellos. According to the game's developers, the music was intended to bring a human element to the atmosphere in the game. The theme song is A Love Suicide, performed by The Hiroshi Murayama Trio with Hiroshi Murayama on piano and vocals by Murayama's wife, Kaori Kondo. A 6-track promotional soundtrack CD produced by Atlus was issued to customers from certain retailers when Rule of Rose was pre-ordered. However, it lacks much of the music from the game. A digital re-release was created, now featuring 18 pieces. This version is superior as it has everything from the original release, plus all the main music from the game.Development  Originally, the game's protagonist was a boy who is kidnapped by a \"big man\" and becomes a victim. The boy becomes chased by boy ghosts who are are really the ghosts of the boys kidnapped by the man. The idea was refused by producers for unknown reasons.[8][9] Some aspects of this idea are still in the final game, as the kidnapped \"boy\" could be thought of as Jennifer as Joshua, and the \"big man\" could be Gregory. When designing Rule of Rose, the developers decided to focus on an adult's view of \"the theme of darkness within children.\" They drew on the \"mysterious and misunderstood\" nature of girls and the cruelty from fairy tales. The story formed through trial and error as the developers figured out how to create fear. They added the children's secret society to the story to give it the sense of fear that they wanted. The developers researched the behavior of children, monitoring a group of European and American children, and photographed references for the game\u2019s textures and models; for the motion capture, the team had Japanese children act. At the request of the developers, the group of children also expressed through drawings or written words what caused them to be happy or afraid. Originally not in the game, Brown was added to balance Jennifer's \"helpless and unhappy\" personality. Because of budget and time constraints, the combat system was left a little rough, including collision and hit detection.Reception  Upon its release, initial reaction to Rule of Rose was lukewarm with mixed reviews. The game has also obtained a Metacritic score of 59/100 and a GameRankings average ratio of 61%. Soon after the game's release, IGN gave it a \"bad rating\" with a 4.9/10.[11] However, its Metacritic user rating is 8.6/10.[12] Despite the average reception that the game received, it has become rather infamous in the survival horror genre for being a polarizing and decisive game. However, many fans of Rule of Rose revere it as misunderstood, overlooked and underrated, and consider it as one of the most tragic, depressing and beautifully dark video games ever created, with an intelligently written storyline, gaining Rule of Rose a cult classic status, with many calling it \"art\". On the positive side, it is generally agreed that the game has an interesting, deep, emotional and meaningful story which touches on some serious themes. Some fans feel it is a game worth playing for the story alone, and that those interested in mature and emotional stories should not pass it. The CGI cutscenes were praised for their ambitious style which tries to be photorealistic; with even a mere scene 3 second scene of Jennifer's clothed being wet showing an incredible amount of effort put into it. Many enjoyed the game's moody atmosphere, and that the music was well-done and added to the somber and surreal world of Rule of Rose. Kotaku featured a retrospective, commenting that Rule of Rose is still savagely twisted, inviting gamers to admire its macabre charm.[13] A common criticism of Rule of Rose is that some players found the gameplay to be clumsy, archaic, boring, and unrewarding. This is often associated with combat (see below). Reviewers were generally divided upon how much the gameplay detracts from one's ability to enjoy the story itself. It has been suggested that Rule of Rose might have been better if it was an animated CGI movie series, instead of a video game - or at the very least, should have been a more polished game. A mainly negative 2 out of 5 review by X-Play claimed the game lacked the \"survival\" in \"survival horror\", despite that the game can be hard and Jennifer can die a lot. They expressed annoyance at Jennifer's slow walking speed and the loading times between rooms were criticized, comparing it to a video game full of endless loading screens. The game contains hundreds of rooms, and loading times can be 5-15 seconds on a PlayStation 2. When the game is played via emulator, the loading times are reduced to around 2-5 seconds. X-Play did, however, praise the CGI cutscenes.[14] Criticized elements include:Controversy and banning In Europe  Rule of Rose raised controversies in Poland, where the Ministry of Education raised questions concerning the game's suitability for minors because of the themes of child violence and sexuality - the game was rated 16+ in Europe and 17+ in North America. In November 2006, three French deputies introduced a bill asking for the game to be banned for sale, arguing that the goal of the game was \"to violate a little girl in the most horrible conditions, then torturing her before killing her in the worst of sufferances.\" They argued that if nothing was done, video games could become an \"uncontrollable factor of decadent violence in our society.\" The European Union justice minister Franco Frattini attacked the game, saying that it contained \"obscene cruelty and brutality\". He also called for changes to the PEGI rating system in place across Europe and for government officials to engage in discussions with industry representatives. According to news site The Register, Frattini received a letter from European Commissioner for Information Society and Media, Viviane Reding, who criticized Frattini's actions: \"It is...very unfortunate that my services were not pre-consulted before your letter to the Ministers of Interior was sent out.\" Reding reminded him of the commission backed self-regulating ratings system called PEGI that has operated across the EU since 2003. The PEGI system of classification, according to Reding's letter, offers \"informed adult choice\" without censoring content - \"This is in line with the Commission's view that measures taken to protect minors and human dignity must be carefully balanced with the fundamental right to freedom of expression as laid down in the Charter on Fundamental Rights of the European Union\". On March 7, 2007, a group of MEPs presented a Motion for a European Parliament resolution on a ban on the sale and distribution in Europe of the game and the creation of a \"European Observatory on childhood and minors\". The game's publisher for Europe, 505 Games, chose to cancel the release of the game in the United Kingdom in response to the complaints by Frattini and other European officials, and \"largely misleading\" commentary from the press. It was released in the rest of Europe. Review copies of the title had already shipped to United Kingdom journalists when this was announced. The Video Standards Council, the United Kingdom rating body which had granted the title its 16+ PEGI rating, responded to the press and Frattini's comments:In Australia and New Zealand  In November 2006, 505 Games' Australian and New Zealand distributor, Red Ant Enterprises, confirmed that the release of the game had been canceled in both territories. Red Ant stated that the game had not been submitted to the Australian Classification Board for approval, without which the game cannot be sold in Australia. Rule of Rose had a Australian release in February 2007.In the United States  At E3 2006, Atlus announced that they would be releasing Rule of Rose in the United States, following Sony's decision to pass on a US release. Sony's decision was on the grounds of the game's erotic undertones involving a cast of female minors. Punchline disagreed with this, saying that the sexual themes are only a small part of the game.Future and possible HD remaster  Fans have requested an HD remaster of the game, possibly with improved controls and graphics. This is ultimately up to Sony and Atlus, and potentially Sega since Sega acquired Atlus. Due to the lukewarm reception and enormous controversy that the game received, along with the questionable state of the game's developing company Punchline, chances for an HD remaster or a sequel are slim. Physical copies of Rule of Rose tend to be expensive, due to the limited copies, turning Rule of Rose into a rare collector's item. Copies are usually often around $150 USD to even upwards of $500 USD on sites like eBay. Rule of Rose is not on the PlayStation Store for PlayStation 3 or PlayStation 4, or any digital distribution sites, leading many interested in the game to pirate it and play it on an emulator.Emulation  The closest thing to an HD edition of the game is the latest version of the PCSX2 emulator, along with a widescreen patch for it. Some PCSX2 users may experience an FMV issue in which they do not work in hardware mode as it will result in a black screen - the system can be switched to software mode whenever a cutscene appears with the F9 keyboard button. This issue seems to have been entirely fixed in newer PCSX2 builds. It is recommend to decrease the Noir Filter for a clearer picture, or use a code to disable it entirely which is included in the widescreen archive.Deleted and unused content  Rule of Rose contains various deleted and unused content not seen in the final release.Trivia External links Clara  Clara is a character of Rule of Rose and a nightmarish form of her, the Mermaid Princess, is one of the bosses of the game. Clara has little screentime, likely because child Jennifer did not know her very well. Clara is a quiet girl who is a resident of the Rose Garden Orphanage. Although she is technically a minor, she is not one of the participants in the Red Crayon Aristocrat Club, and it seems she is unaware of its existence, or perhaps views it as an innocuous club for children having fun. It is strongly implied that Clara was raped or sexually abused by Hoffman over a long period of time, but this has never been confirmed. Clara displays body language that evokes feelings of fear, shame and discomfort whenever Jennifer encounters her. There is evidence she suffers from low self-esteem and poor mental health. There are also implications that Clara may have had an abortion, possibly via a C-section. Diana may be another of Hoffman's victims.Biography  Born in the year 1914, Clara was around 15-16 years old by the time Jennifer had arrived at the orphanage. She was a quiet and lonely girl, dubbed \"The Frightened Princess.\" She seemed oblivious to the antics of the other children and did not attend Aristocrat Club meetings or take part in their cruel hazings and punishments. It seemed that she spent quite a number of years at the orphanage, and by the time Jennifer arrived, she began to assist Hoffman in his work, and at one point, even asked him for a permanent position. Mr. Hoffman took this into full consideration, reflecting in his diary at how he has watched his \"little Clara\" grow, suggesting that Clara had been living at the orphanage since her early childhood. Clara is perceived as a nurse-like character, as she tended to the orphans' wounds when they were hurt and took care of them when they were sick. In November, Hoffman left the orphanage, stating \"Clara's here to look after things.\" Clara mysteriously disappeared shortly after Hoffman and Martha Carol, leaving the orphans all alone without any adult supervision. It is unknown what happened to Clara. It is possible she ran away from the orphanage after Hoffman and Martha were gone, possibly because it was too painful for her to stay. It is also possible she ran away with Hoffman. It is unlikely she would have been able to mentally or emotionally cope with looking after the children while Hoffman and Martha were gone. Clara's fate is ambiguous. It is possible Clara was secretly murdered by the Aristocrats for refusing to join. It is unlikely Clara was present during the orphanage massacre as she already left and Jennifer does not mention Clara returned, but were she present, she may have been murdered by Gregory M. Wilson. It is also possible Clara killed herself in suicide, although one could hope she lived a happier life away from the orphanage.Relationship with Hoffman  There are implications that Hoffman began to take a sexual interest in Clara, much against her will, and that Clara was too frightened to tell anyone or stop him. In \"The Clover Field\" if Jennifer should open the drawers in the Sick Bay of the Airship, Clara will rush to Jennifer stop her, shouting \"Don't look in there!\" There is also unused audio of Clara saying this with a nervous stutter.[1] This is possibly where some evidence to a sexual relationship between her and Hoffman lies, likely condoms, as birth control pills did not exist at the time. After Clara does this, Hoffman's voice can be heard saying, \"Mmhmm...\", as if he is agreeing with Clara.. Clara is seen shuffling her feet when she walks. She is only ever really seen walking when she is following Hoffman, so it is unclear if her movement is due to her fear of him, or if it indicates some kind of pain she might be experiencing. Clara is surrounded by implications of pregnancy and abortion, which may also explain her movements. In her unused audio, she mentions at one point that something is hurting her. Most of the events in the game are from young Jennifer's point of view, where she probably didn't understand the things Hoffman may have done to the girls at the orphanage; and because of this, she probably interpreted Clara in the appearance of a mermaid. During \"The Mermaid Chapter\", it can be interpreted that during one night at the orphanage, child Jennifer saw Hoffman leading Clara to his office (which doubles as a bedroom). Jennifer likely followed them, peered through the keyhole, and saw Clara shirtless in Hoffman's office while her lower body was covered by a bedsheet. Since Jennifer had mermaids on her mind because it was the monthly gift, Jennifer probably imagined Clara as secretly being a mermaid. Clara has gills on her wrists, stitching on her stomach, and gills at the sides of her stomach and rib area when she is in her boss form as a mermaid. She constantly vomits, and as well when she is lifted into the air, there is a mixture of random laughter that sometimes turns into crying. The rope that bound her legs together is supposedly a symbol of Clara being unable to escape her fate. The \"gills\" on Clara's wrist could be young Jennifer's interpretation Clara's self mutilation. The \"gills\" at the sides of her body were possibly from surgery, and the cut on her stomach from a supposed abortion. The scar across her chest could be seen as a symbolism to stop the growth of her breasts. It is rumored that Hoffman got Clara pregnant, and to prevent her from having a child, he performed an abortion himself. Her legs bound together via a mermaid's tail possibly symbolizes of Clara's inability to give birth. Her vomit attacks may be from \"morning sickness\", a common nausea while pregnant. It may also be hinting that Clara was bulimic, as bulimia is commonly co-morbid with other disorders, such as depression and anxiety. She randomly cries and laughs, which is a sign of mood swings common during pregnancy, as well hinting to her crumbling sanity. Clara's Mermaid Princess boss, unlike Clara herself, is almost constantly screaming. Apart from the rope tying her legs together, the Mermaid Princess is shown to be completely unclothed. The bed and nightstand in the Mermaid princess room are the same as the ones in Hoffman's bedroom in the orphanage. This hints that Hoffman would take Clara into his bedroom at night and possibly molest her while she laid in his bed; it also hints that Jennifer followed them one night, peeked through the keyhole, and saw something she didn't understand as a child. In \"The Funeral\" chapter, Clara can be found in the Sick Room, scrubbing one of the cots. The cot she is scrubbing has raised pads, suggesting gynecological examinations. Clara is seen scrubbing an area of the cot exactly where the pelvis would be. When Jennifer turns to leave the room, Hoffman enters the Sick Room and calls to Clara who reluctantly leaves with him into the adjoining room. She also seems to tense up when her name is called. If Jennifer looks through the keyhole, she can see Clara on her hands and knees scrubbing the floor. Her movements may be seen as unnatural and almost sexual looking while Hoffman stands in front of her, pointing to the ground. He then says to her in a low, menacing, yet seductive tone, \"Look, there's some... dust over here... give it a wipe.\" This may be Jennifer repressing memories of what really happened, or simply not fully understanding what she saw. Loud music is constantly played over the intercom during this chapter. Some have suggested this might be another hint to the situation, as Hoffman may have deliberately done this to cover up any troubling noise.Personality  Although Clara is rarely mentioned or shown, it can be taken that she is shy and quiet. Her body language evokes feelings of shame, anxiety and fear. Clara also has a habit of turning away from Jennifer and avoiding eye contact. Jennifer remembers Clara as \"The Frightened Princess\", although she never directly says why. If Jennifer decides to talk to her near the beginning of the game, she seems to refer to her as dirty, as most everyone else does. It is unclear if she is directly referring to Jennifer though, as she simply says \"How dirty...\" and does not elaborate. She avoids making eye-contact with Jennifer as she almost always keeps her head low, a sign of low-self esteem and shame. If Jennifer tries to talk to her in \"The Funeral\" chapter, Clara ignores her just like all the other children. However, as Clara is never shown taking part in any of the Club's other games, it is implied her reasons for not speaking and avoiding eye-contact might be personal. There are strong implications that Clara was suicidal, most likely because of the implied sexual abuse she suffered. Her Mermaid Princess boss has several cuts along its arms, and in her unused audio for the game, she sounds close to a complete breakdown. At one point, she says, \"I don't want to go outside, but I don't want to stay in here either.\" as well as several other phrases as to how she feels alone and feels confused about what is happening to her.Etymology  The name Clara is a feminine form of the Latin name Clarus - borne by a few early saints - meaning \"clear, bright, illustrious, famous.\" Clara was popularized by the 13th-century Saint Clare of Assisi, a friend and follower of Saint Francis, who left her wealthy family to found the order of nuns known as the Poor Clares. The \"famous\" element to the name could possibly be ironic, as Clara was very much ignored by the children of the Rose Garden Orphanage. There could also be irony found in the \"clear, bright\" meaning of the name Clara, as Clara had a very solemn and mysterious disposition.Quotes Trivia References Gregory M. Wilson  Gregory \"Greg\" M. Wilson, also known as\u00a0Stray Dog later on, is an important character in Rule of Rose. He is a very mysterious figure seen lurking around the airship. During the game, he occasionally meets Jennifer and hands her one of his homemade storybooks, which usually contain dark and sadistic plots. For some reason, he addresses her by the name \"Joshua\". In actuality, he is responsible for murdering the orphans of Rose Garden Orphanage (approximately 24 children), with the sole exception of Jennifer. As Stray Dog, he is the final boss.Biography  Gregory M. Wilson lived in the \"Gingerbread House\" in the rural countryside somewhere near Cardington. Gregory's appearance is very simple and disheveled, reflecting his life as a poor pea farmer. According to the manual, he would give children treats, presumably candy, akin to the Stray Dog legend. It is unknown if this is a simple act of kindness, or intention to lure with malice. Any information on Gregory's partner, such as even if he had one, is unknown. Gregory had a son named Joshua, although it is unknown if Joshua is his biological son or another adopted child like Jennifer was. Gregory loved Joshua dearly. He tried his best to give Joshua a wonderful life despite living in poverty, and he did his best to stay close to his son, as well as attempt to get Joshua out the house, either to go and play, or work on the farm with him. But when Joshua was too sick to leave his bed, Gregory would simply do his best to take care of him. During the time that Joshua was ill and bedridden, Gregory would often make him storybooks and read from them. Joshua liked the stories his father told him. After Joshua either went missing, was kidnapped or died from an illness (it is unknown what happened to Joshua), Gregory was absolutely heartbroken and began drinking and smoking heavily. He kept a gun in the house and would often contemplate suicide, and so desperately seemed to want to use it on himself. In June 1929, Gregory found a young amnesiac Jennifer, who was the sole survivor of an airship crash. He took good care of her for months, and as Jennifer states, he was very nice. However, he treated her as if she were Joshua, and it is implied he had her dress in Joshua's clothing and cut her hair. Gregory also read her the storybooks he wrote for Joshua. In early 1930, with the help of Wendy, who found her through a window in a basement room, Jennifer fled Gregory, deepening his grief. Wendy also went into Gregory's study and took his gun in a bag. Gregory's sanity deteriorated and he was under influence of alcohol. Wendy came to Gregory and she may have disguised herself as Joshua, although much of Gregory's and Wendy's interactions are unseen. Gregory was turned into Stray Dog by Wendy, a tool for the seething orphan. On November 23rd, 1930, Martha Carol saw Wendy dog-training Gregory, describing it looked like \"dog training gone wrong\" and reported it to the police in a letter. However, it was too late. On December 20th, 1930, Wendy brought Gregory to the orphanage in order to get revenge on the orphans, although she simply wanted to scare them and prove she was not a liar, not kill them. His noose implies Wendy found him just before he was about to kill himself. He has numerous red scratches, injuries, and rope-like burn markings all over his body, implying self-harm or abuse from Wendy. Wendy may have manipulated Gregory by telling him she (or he, in her disguise) was abducted, bullied and abused by the orphans. Upon arriving at the orphanage, the girls (except Jennifer who was hiding) found Gregory and Wendy outside. However, he was apparently provoked by them and went on a murder spree, killing the orphans relentlessly. Gregory also killed Wendy after she took off her Joshua disguise, likely angered he was manipulated by a fake Joshua. Little Jennifer found Gregory outside. It is possible they may have fought each other. He may have eventually accepted Jennifer was never truly Joshua or a replacement for him, as she was not in disguise, and he chose to spare her life. He said, \"I'm sorry, Joshua\", and it is unknown if he meant Jennifer or his son. Immediately afterward, he completes suicide using his gun, perhaps in hopes of being with his son again in the afterlife, or to atone for his actions, or both.Rule of Rose  Jennifer encounters Gregory a few times throughout the game, although he usually gives Jennifer a storybook and quietly walks away. Because Rule of Rose is assumed to be set in Jennifer's mind, she is recovering her memories of who he is, as he is already deceased. As such, he is akin to a dream character, although from a real world perspective, there is a theory that posits figures in dreams are the true selves of the deceased, and it is unknown if the game's writers had this theory in mind. After the three chapters for the three Aristrocrat girls, Gregory abducts Jennifer in the Club Room. He brings her to a memory of his house where she remembers living with him and leaves her in the rose garden. Throughout the chapter, entitled \"The Gingerbread House\", Jennifer can remember many figments of living with him, such as his addictions and suicidal ideations. After encountering him in the basement, he stops his suicide attempt and locks Jennifer in Joshua's bedroom, calling her Joshua. After Wendy comes to Jennifer's rescue, the player must avoid him or he will capture her, lock her in Joshua's room, and the process will repeat. In the \"Stray Dog and the Lying Princess\" chapter, Gregory comes to the orphanage and kills everyone. He is the game's final boss. It is recommended the Lumberjack Axe be used against him. In the Good Ending, Jennifer helps Gregory kill himself with his gun by giving it to him when he says, \"I'm sorry, Joshua\" which unlocks the way to the rest of her childhood memories. However, in the Bad Ending, Jennifer simply kills him and the game abruptly ends. In the Good Ending route, \"Gregory\" appears in the \"Once Upon a Time\" chapter at the bus stop, writing \"The Little Princess\" storybook. It is unclear if this is a recreation of a real memory that happened, perhaps showing the first time Jennifer met Gregory, or if this never happened. Gregory comes up with the idea of creating a storybook about Jennifer. If Jennifer talks to him enough, he will eventually have a conversation with her. He comes as very misanthropic during this conversation, saying humanity will always lie, betray and hurt each other, and that relationships are only about people trying to get others to serve their desires, and \"everlasting love\" isn't real. This could be considered a rather inappropriate, cynical and awfully pessimistic thing to say to a child. While it is true to a degree, an optimist would argue that humans are more complex than Gregory thinks. After the conversation, Gregory apologizes for coming off as too preachy.Possible murdering, kidnapping and cannibalism  If one looks only at Gregory's Diary, they would come to the natural conclusion that Gregory was a kind, earnest man. However, if the player talks to the Bucket Knight after obtaining Gregory's Gun, it says that Jennifer has taken his \"instrument of justice.\" This implies that Gregory is guilty of something so terrible that he deserves death. It is rumored that Stray Dog kidnaps and eats children by the orphans. This could be an allegory for Gregory. Following this logic, Gregory could easily be the kidnapper mentioned in a Daily Flamingo Newspaper article found in Gregory's house. In the \"Stray Dog Will Have His Peas\" it is commonly theorized that Gregory is Stray Dog and the \"peas\" are children. His diary also mentions making hot pea soup. This can either be taken literally or as further evidence of cannibalism. It is also important to note that Gregory's house is called the \"Gingerbread House\", and is depicted as such by Wendy. The story of Hansel and Gretel involved a cannibalistic witch in a gingerbread house who lured children with candy and ate them. It is said that Stray Dog gives children treats. An unused cutscene found in the game's files suggests a possible game over, or another way of ending the Gingerbread House chapter if Jennifer goes back to Gregory instead of escaping with Wendy. The cutscene also implies that Jennifer hasn't moved on from Gregory's massacre and deep down, still fears him. Gregory seems to be dropping a bloody child's shirt in a dug hole in his backyard. It is truly unknown what happened at Gregory's House. What the player sees could simply be the result of Jennifer's subconsciousness twisting her memories to suit the story of the Hansel and Gretel story or Stray Dog legend.Etymology  Gregory is the English form of Latin Gregorius, which was from the late Greek name \u0393\u03c1\u03b7\u03b3\u03bf\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 (Gregorios), derived from \u03b3\u03c1\u03b7\u03b3\u03bf\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (Gregoros) meaning \"watchful, alert.\" This could refer to the dog-like traits he possessed, the attention and doting Gregory gave Joshua while he was alive, or it could ironically refer to his late inability to tell other children from his son in his grieving state.Quotes Trivia Meg  Margaret, more commonly called Meg, holds the third spot in the Red Crayon Aristocrat Club. Intelligent, but inflexible, she considers herself faultless and carries a notebook containing club rules, notes, and punishment plans with her everywhere. She invents the torture instruments that Jennifer and Amanda are punished with. Meg adores Diana, and follows her around like a puppy, however this relationship is very one-sided. Meg is usually seen with Diana and Eleanor.Biography  Meg is a resident of Rose Garden Orphanage. She loves to read and is called a \"know-it-all\" by Jennifer. During the game, Meg can usually be found reading in the library. She is also close to Susan, often helping her read. Although intelligent, she is still a naive child in many ways and believes Wendy's legend about Stray Dog, just as Diana and the other children do, and takes researching Stray Dog very seriously. She often writes her reports about the Stray Dog legends in her notebook and gives orders to the other members of the club to investigate. When Wendy issued a Rule of Rose to the other orphans not to speak to Jennifer to make her feel isolated, Meg obliged by ignoring Jennifer all the time. Wendy's final Rule of Rose to murder Jennifer's pet dog Brown was also partially obliged by Meg. When Jennifer violently lashes out at Wendy and shows her hatred towards the other orphans, Meg seems frightened and guilty, shaking in fear behind her notebook. Meg, along with the other orphans, chooses to elect Jennifer as their new Princess of the Red Rose, but shortly afterwards is murdered by Gregory M. Wilson as \"Stray Dog\" during the orphanage massacre.Rule of Rose  Meg appears as a mental construct, as the game is a re-enactment of Jennifer's childhood set in her adult mind. As such, Meg is akin to a dream character, although from a real world perspective, there is a theory that posits figures in dreams are the true selves of the deceased, and it is unknown if the game's writers had this theory in mind. Meg is among the rest of the orphans who abduct Jennifer and take her to the airship. In the \"Sir Peter\" chapter, if Jennifer talks to Meg before meeting with Amanda, then she will fault Jennifer and Amanda for not having participated in today's search for Peter and announces that she will report to the Red Rose Princess. In \"The Bird of Happiness\" chapter, Meg and Diana pulled a cruel prank on Eleanor by taking her bird, wrapping it up in her dress, and putting it in a box in a box in a box. They apparently did this, knowing that the bird may die from suffocation if Eleanor did not find it in time. Meg and Diana backtalked Eleanor, saying she \"deserved\" it and they don't really like her. In \"The Mermaid Princess\" chapter, it is implied Eleanor and Meg took Hoffman's koi, sliced it in half, combined it with a doll to make the \"Mermaid Doll\" as mermaids do not really exist, and donated it as the Monthly Gift. Diana was in charge of caring for Hoffman's koi, so she was blamed by Hoffman. Diana blamed Jennifer. Meg's chapter is \"The Goat Sisters\", which is also shared with Diana to a degree. The storybook for Meg, and to a lesser extent Diana, is entitled \"The Goat Sisters.\" Meg fell in love with Diana, and in September of 1930, wrote her a love letter expressing her feelings. While Meg was away, Diana ripped the letter in half, humiliating her and mocking her when talking to Eleanor about the love letter. She kept one half of the letter and stuffed the other half into the stomach of a ragged goat doll. Diana told Meg that someone had taken the letter, and this made Meg become paranoid, as she couldn't find the halves of the letter and was afraid that someone else would read it. Her fears were confirmed when Jennifer found both halves of the letter and read it in full, embarrassing Meg and reducing her to tears, and also made Meg blame Jennifer for ripping it when Jennifer was innocent. As punishment for Jennifer's \"actions\", Meg stuffed Jennifer into an Onion Bag outside the orphanage, while she and the other orphans put an array of disgusting insects and horrible items in with her before abandoning her outside.Personality  Meg is a prim girl with a certain preoccupation with rules; for example, her notebook contains lessons on how to properly curtsy. In her effort to please Diana and fit in with the Aristocrat Club, her devotion becomes \"foolish\", as Jennifer puts it, seeming to ignore the sociopathic, perhaps psychopathic, path the group's hazing has taken. She is intelligent and articulate. Jennifer, perhaps condescendingly, thought of Meg as a \"know-it-all\", likely because Meg can be interpreted as having an elitist and arrogant attitude when it comes to her knowledge, as if she is superior to other people simply because she has more knowledge about certain topics. Meg has the mechanical mind of an engineer or inventor, but uses her talents to create torture devices like the Torture Stick and \"icky water\", rather than improve conditions on the airship. One of her sketches, entitled \"Torture Stick 2\", depicts a decapitated goat head and limbs, illustrating the depths of her creative sadism.[1] Despite Meg's role as antagonist, there's evidence that she's not all evil. Both Diana and Eleanor take advantage of her need for affection and perfection and thus her actions, although largely malevolent, could also be seen as the misguided, attention-seeking behavior of a neglected child. Compared to Diana and Eleanor, Meg seems to be the most empathetic, or at least, the most capable of emotional vulnerability. When she discovers Jennifer with her torn love letter, Meg is heartbroken and cries. Later, when Jennifer stands up to The Aristocrat Club, Meg is seen cowering in fear behind her notebook, whereas Diana and Eleanor are nonchalant, suggesting that Meg, unlike the others, has not yet learned to cope with stress by detaching from her surroundings. It is known that Meg has an emotional connection with Diana (\"I love you with all my heart\"), though whether or not Meg's relationship with Diana has an underlying physical or sexual attraction is open to interpretation. Her devotion could be seen as simply the result of Diana's emotional manipulation and Meg's desperate need for affection.Etymology  Margaret has been an English name since the 11th century, becoming popular throughout the Middle Ages. It derives from the Greek words \u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2, which means \"pearl\" and \u03bc\u03ac\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, meaning \"mother-of-pearl.\" Pearls are very rare treasures, just like Meg, who is gifted with tremendous intelligence and a talent in inventing. The term \"pearl of wisdom\" can also reflect her cleverness. However, pearl oysters also have big, hard shells to protect themselves, which exactly represents Meg's nature and personality: she puts on a tough, proud persona to protect herself, keeping her self-disappointment inside. Her name may also be an allusion to Margaret \"Meg\" March from the classic novel Little Women, which also shares some themes with Rule of Rose such as girls growing up, their camaraderie despite their rivalry, learning about societal expectations, etc. Meg March fulfills the role of the \"perfect\" woman from the time period, much like how Meg of Rule of Rose is a perfectionist. Meg March also teaches some children, while Meg of Rule of Rose acts like a teacher and helps Susan to read.Quotes Trivia Eleanor  Eleanor is a character of Rule of Rose and is a high-ranking member of the Red Crayon Aristocrat Club. She is an orphan at Rose Garden Orphanage. She is often seen holding a cage containing her red bird. Eleanor is known as the Cold Princess, and is given the rank of Countess in the Red Crayon Aristocracy. She is one of the three Aristocrats in the Refined Class including Diana and Meg, with Diana ranking higher than her and Meg, ranking lower.Personality  Eleanor is an aloof and introverted girl who never shows her true feelings to anyone, making her seem unfriendly, distant, and hard to understand. She is quiet and tends to avoid eye contact. Because of her lack of emotion (reduced affect display) and quietness, no one really knows what's on her mind. She is often lost in a world of her own, perhaps daydreaming, and ignores other people. Although she is generally quiet, she is not mute, and speaks when necessary. However, her lack of emotion often seems inhumane and very abnormal for a child\u2014especially when she shows no emotion at the death of her bird, suggesting Eleanor has a neurological disorder. These signs are alarming and could be early symptoms of sociopathy and/or psychopathy. She also does not smile even once during the entire game. Eleanor attends meetings for the Aristocrat Club, and still participates in the other children's twisted \"games\". Eleanor also openly supports and takes part in the Aristocrat Club punishments towards the other children. This is shown when she cheers both to Amanda and Jennifer when they punish each other (on two separate occasions), as well as when Eleanor puts an insect in the Onion Bag while Jennifer is inside it. Eleanor's fascination with birds stems from her wish to \"sprout wings like a bird and fly away to wherever she pleased.\" Birds are a source of happiness for Eleanor. As evidenced by the Bird of Happiness storybook, it is possible that she believed her pet bird would take her to a happy world named Forever Land, where she could escape the troubles of normal life in the orphanage and live in everlasting happiness. The memos in her chapter may be drawn by Eleanor. If so, it could be inferred that Eleanor wishes she was a bird; the Land Sketch would symbolize desire to live in an land of birds while the Family Sketch symbolize her desire to live in a bird family (as opposed to being an orphan). This belief is shortly abandoned after her pet bird is killed, which conveyed to her that \"everlasting happiness is a joke.\"Biography  It is unknown when Eleanor exactly arrived at the orphanage, but it is obvious that she was there before Jennifer's arrival. When Jennifer arrived at the orphanage, Eleanor rarely spoke to her. Eleanor neither became her friend nor her enemy; although Eleanor engaged in many of the punishments, there are moments when Eleanor speaks to Jennifer normally. Wendy's final Rule of Rose to murder Jennifer's pet dog Brown was also partially obliged by Eleanor along with Diana. Even after Jennifer violently lashes out at Wendy and shows her hatred towards the other orphans, Eleanor remains stoic. Eleanor, along with the other orphans, chooses to elect Jennifer as their new Princess of the Red Rose, but shortly afterwards is murdered by Gregory M. Wilson as \"Stray Dog\".Rule of Rose  Eleanor appears as a mental construct, as the game is a re-enactment of Jennifer's childhood set in her adult mind. As such, Eleanor is akin to a dream character, although from a real world perspective, there is a theory that posits figures in dreams are the true selves of the deceased, and it is unknown if the game's writers had this theory in mind. Eleanor is among the rest of the orphans who abduct Jennifer and take her to the airship. In the \"Sir Peter\" chapter, Eleanor can be found in the salon. If Jennifer talks to her, she will ignore her and continue to stare at her red bird. In \"The Mermaid Princess\" chapter, it is implied Eleanor and Meg took Hoffman's koi, sliced it in half, combined it with a doll to make the \"Mermaid Doll\" as mermaids do not really exist, and donated it as the Monthly Gift. Diana was in charge of caring for Hoffman's koi, so she was blamed by Hoffman. Eleanor's storybook and chapter is \"The Bird of Happiness\". In July 1930, the monthly gift for the Aristocrat Club was to be a \"Bird of Happiness\". Since Eleanor was the only person in the orphanage to own a pet bird, Meg and Diana decided to pull a \"prank\" on Eleanor by taking the bird, wrapping it up in her dress, and putting it in a box in a box in a box. They apparently did this, knowing that the bird may die from suffocation if Eleanor did not find it in time. Meg and Diana backtalked Eleanor, saying she \"deserved\" it and they don't really like her. Jennifer managed to find it, but Eleanor entered the room to see her holding the bird corpse straight afterwards. Jennifer quickly claims that she was not the one who killed the bird, but instead of getting angry or upset, Eleanor merely took the bird, put it in its cage carried it to the club door and put it into the Gift Box with no particular reaction, countering Meg and Diana's bet of whether Eleanor would cry or become angry should she find her little bird. From then on, Eleanor always carried around her pet bird's cage, empty. In the \"Rag Princess Sews\" chapter, Eleanor can be found in the salon. If Jennifer talks to her, she will tell her that the thief of Joshua the Bear will be punished. In \"The Funeral\" chapter, Eleanor can be found on the balcony with her empty cage. If Jennifer talks to her, she merely ignores her and continues to stare at the sky. In the \"Once Upon a Time\" chapter, Jennifer expresses pity towards Eleanor, saying, \"Poor Eleanor... She was burdened by her own frozen heart.\"Etymology  The English name Eleanor comes from the Old French form of the Proven\u00e7al name Ali\u00e9nor. The first known bearer of the name was Eleanor of Aquitaine. She was named after her mother, A\u00e9nor de Ch\u00e2tellerault, and called Ali\u00e9nor (from Alia-Aenor, which means other-Aenor in Occitan). It became \"El\u00e9anor\" in the northern Langue d'o\u00efl and in English. Therefore the meaning of the name is sometimes given as \"The Other.\" In Greek, the meaning of the name was \"compassion, pity.\" In Arabic, it means \"God is my light.\" Compared to the other children, Eleanor can be seen as the \"Other Child,\" as in the one who is not like the others. The \"compassion\" element to the name clashes with her cold, indifferent attitude to everyone else and most of the events of the story.Quotes Trivia Enemies  Enemies of Rule of Rose.Amanda  Amanda is one of the main characters of Rule of Rose. Prior to Jennifer's arrival at Rose Garden Orphanage, Amanda held the lowest Social Rank, Poor, in the Red Crayon Aristocrat Club.Biography  Little is known about Amanda's background. She is, from what has been seen in the game (other than Xavier), the most overweight child at the orphanage (which is made even more notable considering the time period the game is set in), so her appearance, as well as her self-esteem, may be another hint towards her past and life at the orphanage, perhaps implying she grew up in a wealthy family that may have been obsessed with the idea of being upper class. Amanda's parents probably died (perhaps in the same airship crash which killed Jennifer's parents), leaving Amanda to go to the orphanage. Amanda has been dealing with the Aristocracy for a long time to the point where they have mentally broken her down, and continue to mock and torment her behind her back. When Jennifer arrived at the orphanage, Amanda welcomed Jennifer, and they were both at the bottom tier in the Aristocracy. Later, Jennifer rose above Amanda's rank, making Amanda jealous and slowly hate Jennifer. From March to October 1930, she kept a diary, venting her frustration at Jennifer. Amanda even used her sewing talents to create a life-sized rag doll of Jennifer to use as a punching bag.[1] After Brown is killed and when Jennifer is invited to the new Aristocrat Club, a remorseful Amanda gives Jennifer a curtsy and asks for Jennifer's guidance. However, Amanda is soon murdered by Gregory M. Wilson as \"Stray Dog\" during the orphanage massacre.Rule of Rose  Amanda appears as a mental construct, as the game is a re-enactment of Jennifer's childhood set in her adult mind. As such, Amanda is akin to a dream character, although from a real world perspective, there is a theory that posits figures in dreams are the true selves of the deceased, and it is unknown if the game's writers had this theory in mind. Amanda is first seen among the girls who abduct Jennifer and take her to the airship. In \"The Unlucky Clover Field\" chapter, Amanda locates a butterfly for the monthly gift and refuses to help Jennifer look for one. Later, Diana and the rest of the Aristocrats encourage Amanda to poke a stick with a rat tied onto it onto Jennifer's face, and she faints. This could imply that this scene really happened in the past. In the \"Sir Peter\" chapter, it is revealed that Amanda felt remorse about it after. Amanda writes Jennifer an apology letter, saying, \"I'm so sorry, Jennifer. Meet me where you can see the sky. Your friend, Amanda.\" Jennifer finds Amanda on the roof where Amanda desperately begs for forgiveness. Later on, when Peter is found by Jennifer, Amanda attempts to make it seem like she found Peter. Jennifer is promoted and Amanda is demoted by the Aristocrats. The Aristocrats repeat the rat punishment with Jennifer giving the punishment to Amanda this time. For the next few chapters, Amanda's role is rather irrelevant, although she does drop something into the Onion Bag. Amanda becomes relevant again in the \"Rag Princess Sews\" chapter. In this chapter, the player can truly see Amanda's insanity and hatred of Jennifer grow. The storybook for Amanda is entitled \"Rag Princess\" and is about a girl who was always a sewer of rags. She makes herself a rag dress to go to the ball like everyone else, but because her dress is filthy, and smells the part, she wasn't allowed to attend. She tried to force another girl to wear the dress instead, and pass the filthiness to her. The Rag Princess and the girl in the rag dress become close friends. This story relates to how Jennifer was the newcomer, and was forced into Amanda's position, causing Amanda to actually like her, since she's more liked by everyone now that Jennifer has taken her place. This story refers to Amanda, her being the Rag Princess, since she's always seen in the sewing room, and refers to Amanda's hatred towards Jennifer, since Jennifer is the girl who wears the gray \"rag\" dress. This story could be a combination of Cinderella, a story that Gregory may have read to \"Joshua\" (Jennifer), combined with Jennifer's memories of Amanda and how she was treated by her. During the chapter, Amanda steals Joshua the Bear and seems to rip off its tail, likely done because of Amanda's increasing annoyance towards Wendy (and perhaps as a symbol of hatred against Jennifer, due to the connections between Jennifer and Joshua). However, it can also be deduced that Amanda wanted to use the cotton to build a life-sized punching bag of Jennifer. When confronted by Jennifer, Amanda accuses Wendy of stealing, but Jennifer eventually discovers Amanda stole it, as Amanda left the tail in her sewing box. Upon being confronted on the airship, Amanda gives the bear to Jennifer so she can be \"Miss Popular\" again, and continues to beat her Jennifer punching bag. When Jennifer donates the bear, Amanda claims to Diana that Jennifer stole it, but fortunately for Jennifer, the \"Princess of the Rose\" has said otherwise. In \"The Funeral\" chapter, Amanda whispers into Jennifer's ear that Brown is dead and points towards a bloodied sack with a large lump inside. In the \"Stray Dog and the Lying Princess\" chapter, Amanda becomes remorseful of killing Brown. She asks for Jennifer's guidance to direct the club, but Amanda is killed by Gregory/Stray Dog.Personality  Amanda is often seen sewing on a sewing machine, and she seems to be quite talented when it comes to creating things made out of fabric. Amanda is selfish and secretive, often hiding things from Jennifer and refusing to help her. Initially thankful to Jennifer for lessening the ill-treatment she received, Amanda expressed remorse for following the Aristocrat's orders at the end of April. However, as time went on and Jennifer succeeded Amanda's ranking, a new-found hatred grew within her. Due to the Aristocrat Club's abysmal treatment of her as if she is a less valuable \"lower class\" human being, Amanda suffers from low self-esteem. She is mostly a lonely outcast who is desperate to be accepted by the other orphans. Amanda longs to be accepted by the higher members of the Aristocracy, but can never seem to do anything right in their eyes, even when she works hard to fulfill her monthly tribute. Amanda has become very sensitive about herself and how others treat or react to her. It is unknown why she is self-conscious, although it is possible she may be a victim of bullying and name-calling. In the \"Once Upon a Time\" chapter, Jennifer states that Amanda was the most self-conscious about her looks than anyone else, and that she would often see her applying Martha Carol's stolen lipstick, late at night. She tends to shift personalities and has mood swings, as she goes from helpful and friendly, to cruel and angry, and so on. She also seems to be mentally unstable, as she takes on a psychotic attitude, and a psychopathic attitude after being demoted to \"Miserable Amanda.\" In her diary, she is seen wishing for the other orphans to \"go to hell\" and die in horrible ways, and comments on hanging one of them herself. After the last entry, Amanda is shown to have made several drawings of a princess growing wings and flying through the sky, similar to a flipbook. However, the further the diary as paged through, the messier and more unstable the drawings become, eventually devolving into meaningless scribbles, referencing the death of her dreams and mental instability.Relationships Jennifer  Before Jennifer came to the orphanage, Amanda was the lowest ranked member of the Aristocrat Club. Once Jennifer becomes a part of the club, she takes Amanda's place, and Amanda is moved up a position. At first she is grateful towards Jennifer and thinks of her as a friend. However, after Jennifer succeeds in finding Sir Peter, she is once again demoted and punished. From then on, Amanda began to harbor a deep hatred for Jennifer, even going so far as to make a stuffed doll of her and beat it with a stick, and later, kill Brown. When Jennifer stands up the Aristocrats, Amanda seems to be trembling and shaking with fear and shame, implying that she feels remorse, regret, and guilt about her treatment of Jennifer.Diana  Amanda seems to have a great fear of Diana, and so acts very timid around her. She is most likely afraid of upsetting her or disappointing her and the higher-ranked club members.Wendy  Wendy seems to harbor ill feelings towards Amanda, considering how Wendy rules over the club and lets Amanda be treated like garbage. The reason why is unknown as their relationship is not explored in-depth. The animosity seems to be reciprocated, as seen when Amanda accuses Wendy of stealing Joshua the bear.Etymology  The name Amanda is, in part, feminine form of Amandus. The meaning of the name comes directly from the Latin word amanda, meaning \"lovable, worthy of love.\" This seems to be ironic with this character, as Amanda is forever striving and working very hard to be loved by the others but never seems to gets any affection from anyone. It also reflects how Amanda did everything to deserve love, but never received any.Quotes  Amanda's DiaryTrivia Hoffman  Hoffman, also known as Mr. Hoffman, was the headmaster and teacher of the Rose Garden Orphanage and is Clara's guardian during Jennifer's stay at the orphanage. He constantly frowns upon the children's mischievous activities, but does not give a second thought to whether or not he should help the children who are being picked on. He seems oblivious to the existence of the Red Crayon Aristocrat Club. He also notably dislikes Jennifer, blaming her for the children getting out of control, despite that it wasn't really Jennifer's fault and the orphanage children were inherently dark inside. He also thinks poorly of her because she was often late and didn't care about being scolded for not doing her assigned chores. Jennifer admits this is true and she was lazy to a degree, as she just didn't care and see the value in trying to make the orphanage as clean as possible - the exception being laundry as she likes clean clothes. Hoffman is theorized to be a \"pedophile\", which generally refers to pre-pubescent children. However, he is probably a hebephile or ephebophile instead which refers to teenage children, due to his suggestive behavior toward two of the teenage girls at the orphanage (Diana and Clara). It is never actually confirmed that Hoffman sexually abused the girls, and it is still possible that Hoffman never laid a finger on the girls in such a way, but the implications are still strong.Biography  He disappeared along with Martha Carol and Clara. It is unknown what happened to him when he left the orphanage in November as he wrote in his diary. He wrote, \"I'm leaving the orphanage. Clara's here to look after things, and the children are quickly growing up. I've done right and fulfilled my duty. Bloody hell! All the trouble started when that wretched child arrived... I've done nothing to deserve this!\" It is most likely that he abandoned the children at the orphanage, however, there is a slim chance that the Red Crayon Aristocrat Club may have murdered him, as well as Martha. It is also possible Hoffman became too scared of the Red Crayon Aristocrat Club, who were becoming increasingly sadistic, and left. Hoffman was absent when Gregory M. Wilson (Stray Dog) murdered the orphans the following month. In the Once Upon a Time chapter, Jennifer comments Hoffman used to be a \"kind and admirable teacher,\" though he supposedly made a transition into a cranky and perverted man in the time that Jennifer was at the orphanage. Because of the chapter's reflective atmosphere, it is possible that Jennifer is trying to remember the positive side of him. Jennifer comments, \"That day, Mr. Hoffman disappeared, like he was running away from something. He had tried too hard to be someone he wasn't. The expectations were too much for him... and he wanted to escape those restrictions. However, children and adults live in the same world, and we must both play by society's rules.\" It can be theorized that Hoffman truly wanted to be an admirable teacher and assistor/helper of unfortunate children, but his possible fetishes got in the way of it, and it was too difficult to \"keep up the hero act\" due to his possible feelings of shame and guilt, so he left.Rule of Rose  During the game, when the opportunities to talk to him arrive, he either insults Jennifer or complains about her, constantly telling her she has to stop playing truant when it comes to chores. In the \"Sir Peter\" chapter, he is seen bound to a chair by Imps and walking in a abnormal way. Later on, he then becomes a boss battle. His boss battle is notorious as it is quite difficult (some players even ragequit), mainly because he is very unpredictable, often retaliates when attacked, has a surprisingly wide range, hits Jennifer hard in rapid succession, etc. Even attacking him from behind is dangerous. Hoffman will try to leap on Jennifer and attack her with his stick. As for the strategy, there really isn't a fool-proof one. There are some tips: Once defeated or \"killed\", the Imps are seen sweeping up his blood. However, he (along with Martha) are inexplicably seen in later chapters alive and do not mention these previous events. After Hoffman's defeat, Jennifer must take the Warm Bag to the Gift Box. Even if Jennifer's health is low or if she is limping, it is recommended the player do not heal, as the chapter ends when the Warm Bag is donated and Jennifer's health is restored after each chapter, so it would be a waste of a health item since all enemies have disappeared. In the \"Mermaid Princess\" chapter, Hoffman's koi goes missing. It is implied Eleanor and Meg took Hoffman's koi, sliced it in half, combined it with a doll to make the \"Mermaid Doll\" as mermaids do not really exist, and donated it as the Monthly Gift. Diana was in charge of caring for Hoffman's koi, so she was blamed by Hoffman. Diana searches for it, but her absence makes him suspect her of taking it. Hoffman is seen in the chapter leading Clara around. After the defeat of the Mermaid Princess, Hoffman interrogated Diana about his koi to no avail. In \"The Funeral\" chapter, Hoffman orders Jennifer to clean the orphanage. Clara can be found in the Sick Room, scrubbing one of the cots. When Jennifer turns to leave the room, Hoffman enters the Sick Room and calls to Clara who reluctantly leaves with him into the adjoining room. In the \"Once Upon a Time\" chapter, Jennifer comments Hoffman used to be a \"kind and admirable teacher,\" though he supposedly made a transition into a cranky and perverted man in the time that Jennifer was at the orphanage. Because of the chapter's reflective atmosphere, it is possible that Jennifer is trying to remember the positive side of him. She also comments that on the day Hoffman disappeared, it seemed like he was running away from something and he tried too hard to be someone he wasn't, and that the expectations were too much for him and he wanted to escape those restrictions.Relationship with Clara and Diana  Hoffman may have sexual interest in Clara and Diana because of the way he acts towards them.Clara  In the Mermaid Princess chapter, he is seen escorting Clara into a bedroom. When Jennifer looks through a gap in the door, she can see Hoffman suggestively stroking someone. Clara is later revealed to be the person in the bed. There are many possible hints on Hoffman and Clara's relationship. In her boss form as a mermaid, Clara has gills on her wrists, stitching on her stomach and gills at the sides of her stomach and rib area. Most of the events in the game are from young Jennifer's point of view, and she likely didn't understand any sexual things Hoffman may have done to Clara, and therefore, interpreted Clara as a mermaid. In The Funeral chapter, Clara is led from the Sick Room by Hoffman into another room, which he then locks. When Jennifer looks through the keyhole, she can see Clara scrubbing the floor, her movements unnatural and sexually suggestive while Hoffman stands near her face, pointing to the ground. He then says to her in a low, menacing and seductive tone, \"Look, there's some... dust over here... give it a wipe.\" There is also an unused audio file in the game's data files that consists of nothing but the sound of Hoffman's voice in what can only be interpreted as him in the middle of a sexual act (although his voice is the only one on the audio file that we hear). In the Sick Bay, it can be noted that there are raised pads on the cot, suggesting Hoffman gynecologically examining Clara. Clara is also seen scrubbing a spot towards the end of the bed. Clara is also seen shuffling her feet whenever she is required to move. This suggests she is experiencing pain in some form around her abdomen. Apart from the implied sexual interaction, it has also been suggested Clara at one point became pregnant which also would account for the raised pads on the cot in the sick bay, and her scrubbing of the mattress. It is also thought Clara might have had an abortion at the hands of Hoffman, himself. There is even unused audio of Clara crying for help in the game's data files in which she constantly asks to be forgiven for something, promising never to do it again.[1] She also cries and laughs hysterically as she repeats that something hurts and how she is alone. In the audio file Clara speaks with in a broken stutter, although this is probably more to do with her mental state as she speaks and is not indicative of her normal speech pattern. It does, however, suggest she is extremely emotional in the scene the audio was meant for. The bed and nightstand in the Mermaid Princess room are the same as the ones in Hoffman's bedroom in the orphanage.[2][3] This hints that Hoffman would take Clara into his bedroom at night and possibly molest her while she laid in his bed; it also hints that Jennifer followed them one night, peeked through the keyhole, and saw something she didn't understand as a child.Diana  Diana is Hoffman's favorite orphan, but the reason why is unknown. Diana also has a bandaged thigh which can only be seen when she lifts her skirt to curtsy, suggesting some sort of injury or bruise, but could also hint at some sexual injury. It is mentioned Diana would spend a long time in the basement thinking about growing up. Jennifer comments, \"She wanted so much to be an adult... and yet she was also afraid of growing up too fast.\" Diana apparently wanted to be beautiful and pure but was self-conscious in believing that every day she separated from her ideal self. Most likely, her fears about losing her ideal self and not growing up into the adult she wanted to stemmed from Hoffman's possible growing sexual interest in her and her revulsion at this. Once the mermaid boss has been defeated Jennifer observes a scene where Hoffman is interrogating Diana about making a mess in the room. He appears to be caressing Diana throughout this conversation in a suggestive way, and could be perceived as crossing the line on how much an adult should touch a child. When he leaves the room, Diana is clearly disgusted by his touch, calling it 'disgusting'.Etymology  The surname \"Hoffman\" refers to the word, \"steward\" of which there are many meanings to. However, Hoffman seems to fit nearly every meaning in one way or another. A steward (from Old English st\u00edweard, sti\u021dweard, from sti\u021d \"hall, household\" + weard \", keeper.\" The general meaning of \"steward\" is someone who manages property or other affairs for someone else. This could refer to how he managed the children at the orphanage. Another meaning of the word \"steward\" refers to a farmer who owns land rather than rents it. This could refer to how he thought he \"owned\" the children at the orphanage (Clara, for example), rather than that he was merely the one in charge of caring for them. Another meaning of the word is \"custodian\": one in charge or buildings, grounds, or animals, of which all were Hoffman's duty. Steward also means \"an attendant on an airplane,\" which is similar to what Jennifer was in the airship crash that killed her parents.Quotes Trivia Mermaid Princess  The Mermaid Princess is encountered in the airship during the \"Mermaid Princess\" chapter. She is the boss form of Clara.Rule of Rose  Before the boss battle, Clara is seen being led miserably into a bedroom by Hoffman. The battle occurs in a room with a bed looking very similar, if not, the same as the one on Hoffman's study, where the scene after the battle takes place; this may be another hint at Clara's backstory. A pair of feet attached to a long rope are viewed at the head of the bed. The rope is attached to a strange, pulley-like mechanism which starts to spin, and the Mermaid Princess is then lifted up from the bed via the rope.Appearance  The boss appears to very much resemble Clara in a horrific mermaid form. Her mermaid-like appearance is possibly the possible sexual abuse as perceived by Jennifer, who, at the time of her experiencing the traumatic event, could not understand what was going on. The boss is topless and unlike Ariel from The Little Mermaid, Clara is not even given a clam-shell bra or any bra of sorts. She appears to have slits and stitches all over her body, which could possibly represent mental scarring, self-mutilation, or suicidal ideation; she also has very long nails. She has red gills on the sides of her torso. On her abdomen area, there is one long vertical slit which seems to be stitched or stabled shut, possibly hinting at a c-section or abortion from Hoffman. She is bound by a rope, which could symbolize Clara's inability to be free and escape the orphanage and her sexual abuse by Hoffman. The rope may also symbolize Clara's wish to \"keep her legs together\"; or even to not have a human reproductive system for Hoffman to violate in the first place, which may be why she and Diana had dreamt of becoming mermaids.Character  Her attacks consist of swinging her arms in order to hit anyone in the way, and vomiting a toxic, green substance on the floor. The amount of health she has left sometimes determines the spill of the vomit. The vomiting could be interpreted as a case of morning sickness, a result of pregnancy, from the possible sexual abuse she suffered from Hoffman. It could also be interpreted as a representation of bulimia, a mental illness that is very commonly co-morbid with depression and anxiety. During the battle, Clara's laughter can be heard, which morphs into screaming and crying, resembling mood swings.Strategy  Some useful preparations before fighting her: Clara is somewhat infamous to players of the game as being one of the harder bosses, even to the point of ragequit. As there is no difficulty level in the game, the requirements to defeat her are the same for every player. This battle can also be considered an endurance test. It should not take more than about 10 minutes. 5-10 minutes should be the average length of the battle.Imp  The Imps, also known as the Little People according to \"The Funeral\", are child-sized, disfigured creatures and the most common enemies of Rule of Rose. Throughout the game, hundreds of these monstrous little beings stalk and attack Jennifer and Brown, especially in hoards. Imps are seen on the airship and in Rose Garden Orphanage, cleaning up blood and, occasionally, bodies.Appearance  The Imps vaguely resemble children, with distorted faces and bodies. The normal Imps are completely white, and wear black clothing. Some of the other Imps resemble animals, having animal heads and features. Some Imps are occasionally seen with paper bags over their heads.Character  While individual Imps are rather easy to deal with, the danger of Imps stems from their high amounts of numbers. Passing through narrow hallways with lots of Imps is a recipe for disaster. Often times, figuring out another way to Jennifer's destination and avoiding Imps, while navigating through Imps when forced to, is the real challenge. Many Imps attack with weapons such as brooms and knives. They tend to swarm Jennifer in groups and jump on her, latching onto her. If Jennifer is being strangled by an Imp, wiggling the analog stick will get them off faster and lessen the damage. Some Imps will attempt to bite Jennifer, while others simply clap their hands in excitement. In one instance, in the Sector 8 Cargo Bay after obtaining the Blue Butterfly during \"The Clover Field\" chapter, four Imps can be seen cleaning the floor in unison. In the \"Sir Peter\" chapter, knocking on one of the Imp's bathroom stall doors will result in the Imp knocking back.Varieties Symbolism  Throughout the game, the Imps attempt to stop Jennifer from recalling her lost memories. In that sense, they are a hallucinations of Jennifer's; they represent her fear of discovering the truth. Jennifer comments on this, stating that her 'weak heart' is what attracted them. The way they gang up on Jennifer in numbers may symbolize how Jennifer felt the children of the orphanage would gang up on her and bully her. The Imps were originally creatures from a scary story that the girls told at the orphanage, relating to Wendy and Stray Dog. It was rumored that they swept away naughty children who didn't do their chores. According to Jennifer, the story spread like a wildfire. The Imps love to clean which is why they carry mops and brooms, and kidnap those who don't clean. In one of the cells in the basement of the orphanage is a small table with what appears to be figurines of the regular Imps. This may reveal where the appearance of the Horrible Imps come from. They seem to be surrounding a doll of Peter being hung. The animal heads represent the paper bag masks that the children wear, hinting that the Imps are based from the children that wear the masks. They are usually heard whispering gibberish. When it is reversed, the phrase \"A bright red crayon, just for you\" can be heard.[1]Red Crayon Aristocrat Club  The Red Crayon Aristocrat Club, also known simply as the Aristocrat Club or the Aristocracy is a small society in Rule of Rose made up of and run by the children of the Rose Garden Orphanage. Their headquarters in reality is located in the orphanage's attic. In Jennifer's mind, it is the lounge by the first class guest sector of the airship. Each member has a title referring to them as a prince or princess and a red crayon, which is one of the club's symbols. Similar to a hierarchy, some members also have a rank title, which gives them a place in the pecking order and tells them how powerful they are in the club. Although officially called a \"club\", it may be considered a \"cult\" more than a \"club\". The club members are unruly and unadulterated from normal society, and it is implied the club members try to hide its existence from the adults. They are two-faced and act well-mannered around adults, but act horrible and violent when they are not around, bullying Jennifer relentlessly. Some methods used within the club can be seen as sadistic, cruel and inhumane, such as their punishments and activities, including harming animals or torturing members who have broken the rules. It has been speculated that the club is responsible for the \"disappearances\" (possible murders) of Hoffman, Martha Carol and Clara.History  The club never truly existed until Wendy introduced all the orphans to the rumors of Stray Dog. She told them the story of Stray Dog luring children out of the orphanage with candy, and eating them up when the Stray Dog had the chance. In fear of the 'animal', the children agreed to do exactly as Wendy said, and so Wendy was the Princess of the Rose. The Aristocrat Club was supposedly created a little while before Jennifer was introduced, and when Wendy and Jennifer (\"Joshua\" at the time) became close friends, Wendy made Jennifer her Prince of the Rose. Jennifer did not know there was an actual club since she hadn't been to the orphanage, but she gladly accepted. The two of them named a stuffed bear after her, naming it Joshua. Wendy brought Jennifer to the club, and though Jennifer had to start at the bottom, Jennifer was glad to make friends with Wendy's help. Though when Jennifer introduced a puppy named Brown in the picture, Wendy became unbearably jealous, and told the other members to treat her poorly so that she'd have to give up on her dog. Jennifer endured various ways of bullying over the months. It eventually lead to the murder of the dog by the Aristocrats, who invited Jennifer to his \"funeral\" in the Club Room. Jennifer, sick of the Aristocracy, finally stood up for herself and told them how much she hated their guts, and that they're the opposite of Aristocrats. This also resulted in the lost friendship of Wendy with everyone at the orphanage, especially Jennifer. Jennifer scolded Wendy and all of the Aristocracy for believing in Wendy, and for Wendy being so selfish. The Aristocracy demoted Wendy from Princess, and she was kicked out of the club. A while later after Wendy's fall from the throne, Jennifer was promoted to the Princess of the Club. However, Wendy returned with her rumored 'Stray Dog' on a leash and had killed all of the orphans except Jennifer in a massacre.Members  Refined Class: Lower Class: Other members:Social Rank  Due to the elitist mindsets and superiority complexes of the \"Refined Class\", the club is divided into \"Refined Class\" and \"Lower Class\" Refined Class: Lower Class: After Jennifer locates Peter, she is promoted while Amanda is demoted.Rules and rituals The Rule of the Rose  The Rule of Rose is said to be an eternal vow sworn to by the young girls of the club to never part from each other. It is said that the vow is taken by girls who yearn for love more than anything else. This vow is where the game draws it name from.Monthly Gift  The Monthly Gift is a ritual where each member must find a specific item and donate it to the Gift Box before the month was over. If the item from the person was not given, they are either punished or demoted. These include:Punishments  Punishments are created by the Baroness (Meg). The aristocracy has the power to deal out punishments to its members whenever they fail to bring forth a gift each month, or if one member disobeys any of the rules, or if a lower member is promoted, thereby punishing the newly demoted member. For example, in the Sir Peter chapter, Jennifer is promoted from the rank of Beggar to Irritating, thereby demoting Amanda to the lowest rank in the aristocrat. Diana forces Jennifer to shove a stick with a dead rat on it in Amanda's face as a punishment. The Onion Bag is a punishment where the one being punished is shoved into a sack. The Aristocracy would then find numerous, disgusting items such as insects, dead animals, rotten food, and drop it into the bag.Trivia Joshua Wilson  Joshua Wilson is an unseen yet important character in Rule of Rose. Although it is certain that he never physically appears in the game himself, his bodily image, name, and spirit live on throughout the story. He is Gregory M. Wilson's son, although it is unknown if Joshua is his biological son or another adopted child like Jennifer was. Gregory loved Joshua dearly.Biography  The true Joshua was a young boy, and seemed to be the only child of Gregory. Gregory was a poor farmer who grew peas. Gregory lived with Joshua at a rural house. What truly happened to Joshua remains a mystery. It appears Joshua became seriously ill, and was often bedridden and unable do much of anything. It is said in Gregory's Diary that Gregory attempted to get his son out of bed to help him or play out in the fields, but Joshua was too sick and so Gregory did all he could to help him. This included writing him stories. It is heavily implied Gregory kidnapped children. It is theorized that they were intended to be either playmates or food for Joshua. The \"Stray Dog Will Have His Peas\" poem lends evidence to this theory when interpreted where the peas are children. After Joshua presumably died (either from his illness, or by a mercy killing), Gregory began to feel completely alone and depressed. Gregory was absolutely heartbroken and began drinking and smoking heavily. He kept a gun in the house and would often contemplate suicide.Jennifer's Joshua  When the airship crashed, making Jennifer the only survivor, she was found by Gregory M. Wilson, who took her in and cared for her as his own child, addressing her as \"Joshua,\" and having her dress in his son's old clothes. Gregory viewed Jennifer as a replacement for his lost boy. Jennifer did not mind this as she understood that Gregory was merely lonely, but she eventually became frightened by his behavior, feeling the need to escape. She eventually met a mysterious girl named Wendy, and they communicated with letters until Wendy set her free and brought her to the Rose Garden Orphanage. As soon as Joshua, as well as Jennifer were gone, Gregory went ballistic. Jennifer's disappearance, as well as Joshua's death/disappearance, affected Gregory's mental health to the point of insanity, and the actions caused by this mental illness led to a violent end for all of the children at the Rose Garden Orphanage excluding Jennifer (and possibly Clara).Wendy's Joshua  Wendy, jealous of Jennifer's relationship with Brown, returns to Gregory's farm under the guise of Joshua in order to manipulate him to the point where Gregory becomes her own twisted version of Brown, living up to the Stray Dog legend. At one point, maid Martha Carol takes notice from afar and describes their interactions as being like \"dog training gone wrong\". At the end of the game, Wendy disguises herself as Joshua once again, this time to bring Stray Dog to the orphanage in order to kill everyone in it. The \"Prince Joshua\" that is seen and heard on the bus and the air ship is actually this version of Joshua (or at least the construct of Wendy as Joshua that is in Jennifer's subconscious), who sends Jennifer on a journey through her suppressed memories to help Jennifer find the forgotten promise she had made to Wendy. While \"his\" original intentions were to have Jennifer remember her oath to Wendy, \"he\" actually ends up helping Jennifer remember the promise she had made to Brown instead.Joshua the Bear  Joshua the Bear was a stuffed bear that Jennifer gives to Wendy after she rescues her from Gregory's house. Wendy names the bear Joshua, and in the \"Rag Princess Sews\" chapter of the game, Joshua the bear goes missing after it is stolen by Amanda. Jennifer is ordered to find it by Diana, and temporarily retrieves it before it is taken by Wendy dressed as Joshua, who states that she has grown rather fond of it. Joshua the bear also serves a symbolic purpose. Toward the end of the game when Jennifer discovers that Brown has been killed by Wendy, after Wendy runs out of the room, a glimpse of the two chairs at the top of the altar is seen. One holds Joshua the bear in it while the other is empty, representing how the friendship of Jennifer and Wendy has been broken, as Joshua the bear, representing Jennifer, is now, once again, all alone.Etymology  The name \"Joshua\" means salvation. This fits in the story because after Joshua was gone, there was a lack of salvation, as Gregory went insane and massacred the children at the orphanage.Trivia Martha Carol  Martha Carol is the housekeeper and cook of the Rose Garden Orphanage, and has been dubbed \"The Queen of Cleaning\" by the members of the Aristocracy. It is rumored by the children that she is a witch.Personality  Although she is a seemingly strict character, she appears to be the only one of the adults who lovingly cares for the orphans. Martha appears to be very suspicious when she witnesses the strange behavior of Gregory M. Wilson, and sends the police (Anthony Dolittle) numerous letters addressing the subject, stating frequently that the children's safety is at stake. Despite her determination in the matter, her pleas are ignored.Biography  Martha appears to have a dislike of Jennifer, as she addresses her as a \"filthy wretch.\" This could possibly be due to the fact that Jennifer would often neglect her cleaning duties, leaving Martha to be the one to tend to her mess. Near the end of November, Martha reported Wendy for exhibiting strange actions, as Wendy had been training Gregory M. Wilson to act like a dog. Her last letter ends abruptly. It is possible that Wendy called forth for Martha's death, due to the possibility of Martha revealing her secret. It is also possible that Martha ran away while attempting to finish her letter, under the threat of Wendy or Gregory. Jennifer mentions when Hoffman left the orphanage in November, Clara and Martha soon followed.Rule of Rose  In the Unlucky Clover Field chapter, Jennifer first encounters Martha cleaning the airship. Later on, Martha is abducted by the Imps and the player must use her hat left behind to find clues. After finding the Blue Butterfly, it is revealed that Martha has been apparently killed by the creatures. In the Bird of Happiness chapter, the player finds her body tied with rope with a Daily Flamingo Newspaper wrapped around her head in Clara's cabin. Somehow, Martha appears to still be alive as she is seen squirming, although this is never explained in the game. This could simply be a result of Jennifer's subconscious mind. In the Funeral chapter, she can be found scrubbing a urinal. She appears to be in good health.Etymology  The meaning of the name \"Martha\" is \"lady; mistress of the house.\" This applies to Martha's character very well, seeing as how she was the oldest and most dominant female at the Rose Garden Orphanage, and was in charge of the cooking and cleaning.Trivia Brown  Brown is one of the main characters of Rule of Rose and was Jennifer's pet Labrador Retriever and her loyal companion. He was very protective of Jennifer, helping her throughout the game and was essentially her only true friend. Brown is also used as an important gameplay device. His sense of smell helps Jennifer find hidden items.Gameplay  Brown accompanies Jennifer throughout the game after she frees him from rope using scissors in the Sector 9 Turbine Area and returns his collar. Brown will respond to Jennifer's commands. Jennifer can command Brown to track items by scent, \"stay,\" and be called to her side. Brown cannot attack enemies (except for gnawing at Hoffman's leg, although this only stuns him and does not damage him). Instead, Brown growls, which distracts some Imps and bosses, allowing Jennifer to retreat or land a few blows without fear of retaliation. Brown can not die; he can only be injured to the point of collapse, causing him to stop distracting enemies or tracking an item. Brown's ability to locate items is an integral part of the game, used in every chapter of Rule of Rose to progress further. The same system allows the player to find health restoratives and other items which, while not essential to complete the game, can help the player. Players select an item from the inventory for Brown to locate, which is then connected to the \"find\" command until changed or removed. Every item selected this way can be used to find at least one type of item. When tracking items this way, Brown can lead the player through the game environments, scratching at doors in his way for the player to open. Most health restoring foods and all tradable items are hidden and must be uncovered by Brown, though the player can choose to avoid searching for these items in order to progress quickly. Dogfood and other items can be used to restore Brown's health if he becomes injured.Biography  Around July 1930, when Brown was still a puppy, he was found by a little girl named Jennifer. Feeling pity for the lonely animal, she decided to adopt him. Jennifer brought him to a nearby shed, which became his home. Jennifer named the puppy \"Brown\" and eventually came to love and care for him as her best friend. Because of him, Jennifer felt something that she never felt before during her days in the orphanage: happiness and love. She gave him a collar with his name engraved on it, and the bond between the two grew stronger as Jennifer visited him every day. Jennifer decided to introduce Brown to her only human friend, Wendy, another child at Rose Garden Orphanage. Jennifer felt happy introducing her new friend to such a lonely child, suggesting both of them care for Brown together. But sensing that Jennifer loved the dog more than her, Wendy became angry and jealous. Wendy kindly asked Jennifer if she could get rid of the puppy and give it away, in hopes that Jennifer would forget about Brown and continue to have herself as her only companion. Wendy also said that such a \"filthy dog\" did not deserve to be Jennifer's friend. Unfortunately for Wendy, Jennifer refused her request and continued to take care of Brown. Wendy gave orders to the Red Crayon Aristocrat Club to make Jennifer suffer in order to make her abandon Brown, but Jennifer never gave up, as she still had the dog to keep her strong. Wendy found her plans weren't going as well as she had thought, so as a last resort, she decided to make a final plan: to kill Brown. One night in November 1930, the children secretly took Brown and put him inside a bag. Because Jennifer's memories are fragmented, it is never explicitly shown how Brown died. One theory is that the children beat him to death with sticks, as seen in the beginning of the game if Jennifer looks past the orphanage gate. The bag is later buried in a coffin in the courtyard, so if Brown was still alive by that point, he would have suffocated. Diana, Meg and Eleanor are seen building this coffin in the introduction of the game. It appears Jennifer then dug up the coffin to discover her dead friend. Another possibility is that Brown was strangled with rope due to the rope imagery throughout the game. A final possibility is that Brown was beaten with hammers, as seen in the opening. \"The Funeral\" storybook also implies Jennifer sacrificed Brown. In the chapter \"The Funeral\", which is set during November in Jennifer's dreamscape of memories, Jennifer finds scattered papers addressed from the Aristocrat Club, reading \"This month's gift: Filthy Jennifer.\" Brown's whimpers lead Jennifer to the attic, and on the door, she finds the message \"This month's gift: Filthy Brown.\" Fearing what might have happened to her dearest friend, Jennifer hesitantly enters the room. Inside, Jennifer sees Brown dead inside a bloody bag. Jennifer collapses to the ground as Wendy reveals herself to Jennifer as the leader of the club, and the murderer of Brown. Enraged, Jennifer cries, sobbing angrily before standing up and slapping Wendy to the ground. She then sits on top of the collapsed Wendy and begins to slap her repeatedly, demanding that Wendy \"go away\" and shouting that she'll never forgive her. Jennifer then retaliates against the Aristocrats, stating that they are far from aristocrats, and are merely a bunch of fools for believing Wendy's lies. Wendy then runs out of the room, sobbing and humiliated.Rule of Rose  After Jennifer rescues Brown from being tied with rope, Brown helps Jennifer survive in her dreamscape of childhood memories, helping her on the airship and protecting her against Imps. Brown doesn't have a particularly strong role in most chapters until \"The Funeral\" chapter when he disappears and a mentally distraught Jennifer begins to hallucinate Brown's body all around the orphanage, eventually being forced to confront and accept her repressed memory of his death. In the next chapter, when Stray Dog appears and assaults Jennifer, Brown's memory appears as Jennifer's strength to help assist her. If the player gets the Good ending, they unlock the \"Once Upon a Time\" chapter, which explains how close Jennifer and Brown were. Jennifer locks Brown inside her memories, promising to protect his memory forever and ever until she dies.Etymology  It seems that young Jennifer named him Brown because of the color of his fur. This has led fans to joke about how Jennifer is unimaginative and simple, as she is the type who sees a brown dog and would name them Brown just because of that. In a way, this could be seen as something a child would do, and Brown is a major part of Jennifer's childhood. Brown's simplistic name adds to the theme of the game concerning childhood. The color brown represents wholesomeness and earthiness, as well as steadfastness, simplicity, friendliness, dependability, and health. So not only does his name Brown represent him literally, but also his nature and attitude. The term \"to brown someone\" means to depress or irritate. This could relate to Wendy's feelings towards him.Trivia Olivia  Olivia is the youngest resident of the Rose Garden Orphanage and member of the Red Crayon Aristocrat Club.Personality  Olivia's main objective seems to seek attention, which was most likely the thing she lost when she was sent to the orphanage, and constantly cries in order to obtain attention. She also seems to be very impressionable, which is not a good quality when surrounded by the sadistic and bullying Aristocracy. It could be deduced that she, like the rest of the orphans, also has a malevolent personality that she is developing from witnessing the other children's mischievous behavior, as seen when she tells Jennifer she deserves to be gobbled up.Biography  Olivia is in the Bourgeoisie class of the Red Crayon Aristocrat Club. She can be seen as the \"partner\" of Susan, as they are usually seen together.Rule of Rose  Olivia is seen crying in various places throughout the game. If Jennifer tries to comfort her, she simply cries harder. During the \"Unlucky Clover Field\" chapter, she is first seen crying over a dead green butterfly. When Jennifer bends down to pick it up, she shoves a dessert fork into the ground, nearly stabbing her hand. She then leaves the room with the words: \"You deserve to be gobbled up.\" Olivia is seen standing in front of a blackboard in the \"Sir Peter\" chapter, on which are some simple mathematical equations. If Jennifer attempts to talk to her, she immediately hunches over and says, \"Mr. Hoffman is really scary when he's mad...\" after which, she begins to sob. This could possibly mean that Mr. Hoffman was trying to teach Olivia, and became frustrated due to her not understanding the material. In the \"Goat Sisters\" chapter, if Jennifer attempts to enter the filth room, Olivia and Susan will keep her out. If Jennifer goes into the next room and peeks through the crack in the wall, Olivia can be seen playfully running around and around the post. Later on, Olivia drops an item into the Onion Bag. In \"The Funeral\" chapter, Olivia can be seen in the kitchen, attempting to reach a pot, which is up on the counter. There seems to be no apparent reason for this, as there is nothing in the pot; thus it can be deemed as another one of Olivia's attempts to receive attention. It may also be noted that if she were to jump up, she would have indeed been able to reach it. As soon as Jennifer approaches her, Olivia hunches over and begins to sob once again. When Jennifer attempts to comfort her, Olivia simply cries harder - this could suggest a spiteful characteristic. She and the other girls attempt to apologize to Jennifer by showing her great respect before her life is ended in the Rose Garden Orphanage massacre at the hands of Gregory M. Wilson. In the \"Once Upon a Time\" chapter, Jennifer states: \"Olivia, the one who cried all the time, stopped crying completely when all the adults were gone. With no teacher to give her attention and no cleaning lady to scold her, there was no point in crying anymore... Poor Olivia.\"Etymology  Olivia's name was most likely derived from the character, Olivia, from William Shakespeare's play, Twelfth Night. Much like the Olivia from Rule of Rose, this Olivia is a very emotional character, who also allows her feelings to get the best of her. In the play, Olivia has lost her brother and remains grief-stricken, rejecting all visitors that come to console her, claiming that she will remain in mourning for the next seven years. In Rule of Rose, Olivia is often crying for various reasons, and like the Olivia from Twelfth Night, she also refuses consolation.Quotes Trivia Susan  Susan is a character in Rule of Rose. Her task in the Red Crayon Aristocrat Club is to gather information on Stray Dog, and she is most likely the second youngest of the orphans after Olivia.Personality  Susan is perceived as an impetuous girl with a very vivid imagination. As her title suggests, she is very impulsive and quick to jump to conclusions. This is shown in how often she spreads rumors and takes part in gossiping. She can be viewed as clumsy, as while attempting to do a curtsy, she stumbles and almost trips. She has difficulties with communication, as she speaks with a lisp and a stutter. She also often repeats things that she has already said, and is usually seen sucking her fingers. Like Olivia, Susan is also somewhat of a kiss-up to the higher members of the Aristocracy, perceived as rather a \"servant\" in contrast to an actual valued member.Rule of Rose  Susan is first seen spying on Jennifer with Meg as she first approaches the gift box. As they escape into the Library giggling, they leave part of the Two-Leaf Key behind. The player can then view them through the keyhole of the library door, where Meg seems to be teaching her how to read. Later, she can be heard reading a story, after which she runs out of the room with Meg, and down the stairs to the main floor. It is unknown where she goes after the said event, but the next time she is seen is on the Aristocrat altar of the Club Room, after Jennifer offers her butterfly gift. The next time she is seen is in the \"Sir Peter\" chapter, where she complains that Peter \"smells like poo,\" and she appears later on with the rest of the club members as Peter is sacrificed. In the \"Bird of Happiness\" chapter, Susan is seen whistling bird-calls over the banister of a long, staircase. When Jennifer approaches her, she says: '\"Why won't the birdie fly to me? ...Why does it have to be you? Stay away! I said stay away!\" This could possibly be a reference to the expression, \"a little birdie told me,\" a metaphorical and comic remark used by ones who don't want to reference their stated information. This could mean that Susan was literally searching for a \"little birdie\" to give her information that she could use for rumors. Susan also appears in \"The Goat Sisters\" chapter. If Jennifer should attempt to enter the filth room, Olivia and Susan will keep her out. If the player should choose to go to the next room and look through the slit in the wall, Olivia can be seen running around the post, while Susan seems to be standing still with her fingers in her mouth. Later in the chapter, Susan is seen with the rest of the children, dropping insects and other disgusting items into the Onion Bag, with Jennifer inside. After this, Susan is not seen until the \"Rag Princess Sews\" chapter. When Jennifer talks to her, she expresses concern over the disappearance of Joshua the Bear. At the end of the chapter, she and Olivia are the ones to forcefully pull Jennifer into the Club Room, after which she resumes her place on the altar. Near the end of the scene, she slowly walks away, as the rest of the children do, leaving Jennifer alone to be attacked by the Imps. In \"The Funeral\" chapter, Susan is first seen doing chores with a few of the other children. Later, she can be seen in the library with Meg, reading, and ignoring Jennifer. Much later in the chapter, Susan can be seen next to the rest of the girls in the Club Room, after Jennifer discovers that they had killed Brown. It is unknown how she felt about this, as her expression is indeterminable. In the \"Stray Dog and the Lying Princess\" chapter, Susan is seen gossiping with Amanda, after which, she curtsies to Jennifer and runs downstairs. Downstairs, she and Olivia curtsy to Jennifer yet again (Susan stumbles while doing so), and allow her to pass between them. About a minute later, Susan advises everyone that she sees Wendy from out the window, and they all run outside to possibly mock her. Susan seems to pick something off the floor on her way out. When the girls arrive outside, they are massacred by Gregory M. Wilson under Wendy's command.\ufeff In the \"Once Upon a Time\" chapter, if Jennifer should examine the blocked-off toilet stall in the men's lavatory, she will say: \"Once, Susan started a rumor about voices coming from this room at night... It turned out it was only the door creaking in the wind, but one night, sounds came from the room even with the windows shut. Susan jumped out of her bed and screamed. It was really just a prank by Nicholas and Xavier. From then on, the room was believed to be haunted and was considered off limits.\" This is the only thing she has to say about Susan.Etymology  The origins of Susan's name may have come from the Book of Tobit, in which the woman, Susanna, is required to defend herself against wrongful accusation.\ufeff This is similar to Susan's character, for Susan was known for spreading rumors, and may have frequently had to defend herself by getting the others to believe that the rumors were true.Quotes Rule of Rose Original Soundtrack  The Rule of Rose Original Soundtrack is the soundtrack of Rule of Rose. The musical score was composed by Yutaka Minobe, who also composed the music of Skies of Arcadia and some tracks from the Panzer Dragoon Orta soundtrack. The entire score was created without electronic instruments - most of the music was produced by musicians using string instruments. According to the game's developers, the music was intended to bring a human element to the atmosphere in the game. A 6-track promotional CD produced by Atlus was issued to customers from certain retailers when Rule of Rose was pre-ordered. The CD also included exclusive content in the form of wallpapers, music sheets and a promotional video. A digital re-release was created, now featuring 18 tracks. This version is superior as it has everything from the original release, plus all the main music from the game.[1][2]Original tracklist Re-release tracklist  The original release of the soundtrack is missing much of the music from the game (now added in the re-release). The majority of the missing music can be found on the records:Missing songs  Two pieces of missing music cannot be found on the records:The Goat Sisters  The Goat Sisters is a storybook vital to Jennifer in remembering her promise in Rule of Rose. It is presented to her by Joshua Wilson in the Club Room along with The Bird of Happiness and The Mermaid Princess.External links Rose Garden Orphanage  The Rose Garden Orphanage is the orphanage at which the members of the Red Crayon Aristocrat Club reside. The orphanage is located in the village of Cardington, Bedfordshire, England. It is an important location in Rule of Rose and a few of the chapters are set here. It was run by Hoffman with Martha Carol as the cook and cleaning lady, with some assistance from Clara. However, all three of them mysteriously left, leading fans to speculate if they were murdered by Gregory M. Wilson or the Red Crayon Aristocrat Club. When Jennifer lived at the orphanage as a child, the orphanage housed 25 orphans, including her. It is unknown if the orphanage has an adoption process, or if children leave once they become teenagers/young adults who are of age to live on their own, or both. However, given that Hoffman tells a crying Diana, \"No new mummy or daddy will ever want if you look like that.\" it would seem that it does have an adoption process. Due to Jennifer's memories, many rooms of the orphanage appear in the airship. Rose Garden is also the site of many of Jennifer's traumas and painful memories suffered there, however, as seen in the \"Once Upon a Time\" chapter, she also had many heartfelt and treasured memories with the orphans there.Massacre  On December 20th 1930, Wendy brought Gregory M. Wilson to the orphanage, whom she trained to act like a dog. As \"Stray Dog\", Gregory murdered all of the orphans (excluding Jennifer) before suiciding with a revolver. The fate of the orphanage is unknown, but it presumably closed after the massacre.Layout  The orphanage is a large building, consisting of 3 stories (including the attic and ground floor), and it also has a basement.Ground Floor  On the ground floor is the entrance hall, in the first section of which are shoe lockers. In the second section, there are four doors and a front staircase leading to the first floor. Three of these doors lead to hallways while one leads to the reception room. The ground floor rooms are: The ground floor has two staircases.First Floor  The first floor has two staircases but there is nothing notable about either of the landings. The rooms on the first floor are:Attic  There are two doors opposite to each other that lead to the attic; both are usually locked. The one on the left side includes the Club Room and the hallway leading to it (which includes another entrance to the other section of the attic). The door on the right side leads to a place of storage as well as several other doors that lead to small rooms, one of which is the Prince and Princess' Quarters.Basement  The rooms in the basement are referred to as cells. These cells are:Known orphans  The last orphan's names were inspired by a poem called The Gashlycrumb Tinies by Edward Gorey. [1] They are mentioned in Amanda's Diary, and Una and Victor can be seen written in the 1st Passenger Corridor.Trivia Aristocrat Club Members  Characters who are members of the Red Crayon Aristocrat Club.", "Phantasy Star Universe Wiki": "Phantasy Star Universe Wiki Phantasy Star Universe Wiki Featured article  Fill me inFeatured media  Fill me inHelping out  To write a new article, just enter the title in the box below.Weapons  There are 27 weapon types in the game ranging from knifes to swords, pistol to shotgun and rifles. The weapons use photon energy power to work. The photons also give the weapon its color based on its element it uses. There are seven different elements the weapons can use fire, ice, lightning, ground, dark, light, or just neutral. Weapons can also be grinded to improve their power and effectiveness. Grinding can be done at the shop in which the weapon was made. If Tenora Works created that weapon type you must go to there to have it grinded. Also you must have the proper grinder for that weaponItalic text See bottom for grinding details, Note: To grind a weapon, you must first have a grinder board, and the matching grinder base. Then, you must go to your robot and synthesise your grinder. Grinding be from +1 to +10  Note: C Grade weapons can use any grinder Note: B Grade weapons can use B grinders to S Grinders Note: A Grade weapons can use A grinders to S Grinders S Grade Weapons Can use S grinders Bold textonlyCASTs  One of the four PSU playable races. CASTs are androids. CASTs are unique in that they are able to use SUV Weapons. CASTs are quantitatively not the dominant species on any of the planets, but on Parum they make up most of the government.Strengths General statistics Beasts  Beasts are one of the four playable races available in Phantasy Star Universe. A genetically engineered race, they exhibit high physical strength and endurance; meaning they are suited for physical labor. Their weaknesses are their low mental abilities and accuracy.Races  There are four different races in PSU: Humans, Newmans, CASTs and Beasts.Newmans  One of the four PSU player-races, Newmans are generally seen as being adept in Techniques, as a result of the increased mental abilities of this race due to genetic engineering. However they are the least physically imposing race.Strengths General Statistics Humans  One of the four playable races in Phantasy Star Universe, Humans are the 'original' race in the Gurhal Star System and the creators of the other races - the Newmans (to make a mentally proficient super-race), Beasts (engineered for physical labour) and the Casts (made to serve Humans). These races were originally oppressed or enslaved by Humans, but now Humans co-exist as equals with the other races. Humans are known for being Jacks of all trades, but masters of none.SUV Weapons Description  SUV Weapons are weapons exclusive to CAST use. During battle, a CAST can use satellites to summon large, powerful weapons that they cannot otherwise store on their person. These weapons can deal a significant amount of damage and have the ability of inflicting status effects.Obtaining SUV Weapons  SUV Weapons are only available to CASTs of level 20 or higher. In Network mode, players can obtain SUV Weapons from the GRM Unit Shop on Parum, costing between 2500-120000 meseta. In Extra mode, however, SUV Weapons cannot be bought from stores and can only be obtained through achieving an S-Rank on certain missions. In Story Mode of Ambition of the Illuminus, SUV weapons are sold at the GRM Unit Shop on Parum, similar to Network Mode. Players can only use SUV Weapons if they are equipped with a line shield that has an Extra slot. In addition the line shield must match the letter grade of the SUV or exceed it.Using SUV Weapons  Once a SUV Weapon is equipped, a blast gauge at the bottom of your character's status bar will fill up as you take and deal damage, similar to the Photon Blast system in Phantasy Star Online. When full, the gauge will glow brightly. Once the character is standing still, a button combination (this varies between platforms) will appear next to the Weapon information bar. Pressing this combination will activate the SUV Weapon. After a short summoning sequence, the SUV Weapon will appear and begin attacking. Once the attack has begun, the player cannot assume control over their character until the attack sequence is completed. There is only a small window of time during the summoning sequence that the player can fine-tune the direction that their character is facing. The final outcome of the attack depends wholly on the SUV Weapon used, so players must be careful when activating it. During the summoning and attack sequences, the player is completely invincible to enemy attack (though the character may be pushed around a little).Tenora Works  Tenora Works is a weapons manufacturer on Moatoob. They produce Sabers, Handguns, Daggers, and many other weapons. This is where most, if not all rouges get their equipment from.Weapons  Weapons are a character's basic equipment, used to deal damage, inflict status effects, or to cast TECHNICs. There are 27 weapon types in the game, which can be classified either by their basic function (striking weapons, ranged weapons and TECHNIC weapons), or by what hands they are used with. The following chart shows the distinct weapon types, according to their classifications.Rifles  Rifles are two-handed ranged weapons usable by Rangers, Fortegunners, Guntechers, and Gunmasters. They have long range and the ability to go into first person shooting mode, and can be used with several elemental Bullets. They are considered to be the ranger's signature weapon.Ethan waber  Ethan Waber eine Hauptperson in der PSU Reihe. Ethan Waber Eine Hauptperson in der PSU Reihe.

If you feel that a template belongs on this page, do not hesitate to add it.What are templates?  Wiki templates provide a means to insert the same content over and over in different (or the same) pages. This saves editors the hassle of duplicating the same text again and again, and also helps ensure consistency. Templates are generally shown with the format required to use the template (i.e. ). Clicking the template name takes you to the template's page, where you can see what it looks like and how it is used. Detailed instructions on the usage of each template should exist either on the template page, or the template's talk page.Article management templates Nominate an article for deletion  {{delete}}Disambiguation articles  {{disambig}}Stubbing  {{stub}}Category templates General category template  {{category}}Template category template  {{templatecategory}}General wiki templates Clear  {{clr}}, plus {{clrl}} and {{clrr}}For  {{for||}}Main article  {{main|}}Right-aligned Table of Contents  {{tocright}}Sandbox  {{sandbox}}T is for template  {{t|}}Welcome  {{welcIP}} and {{welcome}}Wikipedia  {{wikipedia}}, {{wikipedia-deleted}}Races  Final Getsuga Tenshou Ichigo gets stabbed by Aizen then Ichigo becomes Zangetsu, but then he loses shinigami powers.TitleTemplate.png Summary  Title image template for use on Main Page.De Ragan De Ragan  De Ragan is A level 20 dragon and is the boss of the level \"Ruler of the plainsGetting there  Getting to De Ragan can be a long and hard process unless proper precaution is taken into the matter, The most effective weapons are rifles with an ice photon art, Machine guns with lots of power points with a ground or ice photon since the enemies are fire ( Koltova's and Distova's ) and lighting ( Polty's and Vahra's ) And shotguns with ice or grounds photonsDefeating De Ragan  Defeating De Ragan can be both very easy and next to impossible, some good tactics to easily take him out are using rifles while he is in the air and machine guns/Shotguns while he is landed.

There may be errors or omissions that need fixing, or pages that clearly need improvement. Whenever there is nothing in subcategories or articles below, such contributors are urged to look at:Administrators  Different users have access to different functions of the site. While anyone can do most things on the site, including reading and editing, administrators can access a few additional functions.Administrator abilities  These additional functions are: A bureaucrat can make other users into bureaucrats or administrators on their own wiki. However, he or she is not currently able to remove admin access from any user; please contact one of the community staff if you need that done. Some Wikia staff members have full access to all Wikia. They will be shown in Special:Listusers/staff on any wiki. Wikia janitors have limited administrator access to all Wikia for cleanup purposes. These users will be shown on Special:Listusers/janitor on any Wikia. Please see the Central Wikia contact page for details on how to contact Wikia staff.Who are this wiki's administrators?  The \"founder\" of a wiki, the person who first requested it, is given administrator access automatically. Founders are also given bureaucrat access so they can make any other user on their wiki an administrator or bureaucrat.

If there are no active bureaucrats and you wish to become an administrator, please contact the community staff on the Central Wikia.What can administrators not do?  Administrators should not use their administrator powers to settle editing disputes; for example, to lock a page on a version he or she prefers in an editing dispute that isn't vandalism. Administrator powers should be used to help keep the wiki clear of vandalism, spam, and users who make malicious edits, but not for simple disagreements between users acting in good faith. Ideally an admin shouldn't be considered \"in charge\".

The 72 Clan was founded on July 26, 2011, and since then, its leaders and members have helped it flourish within the community. The clan aims to nurture as many productive people as possible, and to establish one of the most organized clans on Runescape. The main goal of this organization is to encourage and educate people into becoming more productive within the RS community. Similarly, it discourages gambling, floor selling, and other forms of malicious acts within RS. To promote entertainment, the clan hosts events.

Be it within Clan Chat or Teamspeak; be it your points missing or your name not appearing on the prestige document. Maybe a staff member is not doing their job as they were expected, or maybe an event leader didn't treat the attendees nicely.

Prestige and Events Led documents are the most bookmarked ones.Teamspeak Server  Our clan uses Teamspeak for communication. It is used frequently as it's a great way for members to talk, discuss different things, and enjoy the game further. Teamspeak is an essential requirement for Rots, Interclan Minigames, Daily Teamspeak Gathering events and Monthly Staff Meetings. Having a microphone is not mandatory, but having speakers is. Teamspeak is 100% free, and easy to use, so do not worry. To Setup Teamspeak, please take the following steps: 1- Download Teamspeak\u00a0Client (not server) that is compatible with your Operating System (e.g. Windows 7 32-bit).

Everyone is welcome to help and contribute! Contributions can be made directly to Teamspeak, or indirectly to clan's Paypal account \" 72clan@gmail.com \".Teamspeak Rules Teamspeak Server groups (icons)  To see all icons available on ts, Right Click on your name, and then hover over \"Set Server Group\".\u00a0You may only receive icons (Server Groups) based on your current rank in 72. Acknowledge that icons that start with \"72 Clan\" do not count as your chosen icons, hence you may have 5 of them even if you're a recruit. All server groups that begin with 72 Clan may be given to members at no cost. You must make sure to click on \"Main Channel\" on teamspeak for further information on the icons. To receive teamspeak icons, contact Captain+ on teamspeak.  \u00a0Google Calendar  As everything is meant to be extremely organized in 72 clan, the clan's daily events are moved to Google Calendar for max efficiency and accessibility. All members can see the events that took place in the past, present or the future simply by one click. To be able to set it up, we have provided you with a step-by-step guide. If you don't have a Google account, please set it up by clicking here . If you have a Google account: Note: If the Calendar is not on your time zone, then you have made a mistake at setting your Calendar up. Simply go to settings and play around until you get it fixed. To be sure that it is correctly adjusted, look for the exact date and time -right now- on the calendar. It should be represented by a dynamic red line that moves by your time, and is displaying your current time. If that red line is not correctly adjusted, you would need to go to settings to sort it out.Screenshot Tools (Puush or Gyazo)  Being able to effectively screenshot your game experience is vital. Maybe you got an awesome drop at a boss that you want to share, or there is a cool glitch you would want to share with people on Teamspeak or Facebook. Or perhaps there is an incident in the public or clan chats from a clan member that you feel a high ranked member should be notified about in order to help keep our community strong. Having a fast and effective screenshot tool can be very handy! It may be a good idea to have both Puush and Gyazo, as each has its own advantages, but if you want to stick with one, just get Puush. Instructions to set Puush Up:Ranking System  Every rank has a role in this clan. Higher ranks have more responsibilities. The higher ranks are expected to carry out tasks such as setting up events, settling disputes and recruiting more members for the Clan. Higher ranked players may help less experienced ones and guide them through their new experiences but are not forced to do so. You may earn a higher rank by receiving Prestige, Diligence, and Valor. Your earned Prestige will stay saved for that duration. If you had to leave Runescape for more than 1 week, make sure you let us know in here . Members who aim to aid the clan in the most efficient manner and earn ranks in a faster rate are able to apply to join the Clan Staff by clicking here .Ranking Table  If you are currently a member, please visit this\u00a0Facebook's document\u00a0to find your current Prestige and Diligence.Prestige  The Prestige is earned by your activity and participation in the clan. The more active you are in the clan, the more respect you earn. Attending events, collecting resources at citadel when needed, and helping the clan members are one of the many ways of earning Prestige. If you are currently a member of the clan, click on each hyperlink for further info.Exp for Prestige  You may also earn Prestige dependent on how much xp you have earned while you\u2019ve joined the clan. To see your current xp Click here Reaching 100M xp will yield in +20P Bonus. Reaching 200M xp will yield in +30P Bonus. Reaching 500M xp will yield in +40P Bonus and +1 Diligence. Reaching 750M xp will yield in +45P Bonus. Reaching 1B xp will yield in +50P Bonus and +1 Diligence. One may not\u00a0stay\u00a0solely dependent on XP for prestige, as this is just a supplementary prestige addition If you are eligible for Prestige, please inform us today by commenting herePrestige for Name Change  Runescape Name is a very important part of every player's character. Some players honor the clan by adding the name of our clan to their names. Depending on the rank of the player, he/she may receive bonus prestige by doing so. You must report your name change on Facebook, or you will not receive any bonus prestige for your name change! Reverting your name back will result in loss of cumulative amount of Prestige, depending on your rank. It can be done once, so having a name of 72 72 72 72, will not grant you 4x the Prestige. To be eligible for the prestige, the name change must be reported on the document, by commenting on the target's name. Contact a high rank for more info.Diligence  All members require more than just Prestige to earn their relatively high rank. Diligence is like a Medal of Honor granted to those members who achieve outstanding accomplishments. There are several ways to earn Diligence. The main ones include having exceptional Integrity, Activity, and Mentality. Members with at least one are eligible for Sergeant Rank. Members with at least three are eligible for Lieutenant+. Members who are highly trustable, active, wise, and loyal will be given the chance to earn Admin+ Ranks. It is important to note that all Captain+ regularly monitor and provide feedback about people who they consider as diligent-worthy.\u00a0  \u00a0 If diligence is what is preventing you from being promoted, be sure to comment on your name on the Prestige, Diligence and Valor document and request \"Diligence Investigation\". Be sure not to comment if you have received diligence sometime in the past two months. If you have, then that's ordinary. If it has taken longer, then you may be doing something wrong. \u00a0 The following will increase your chance of receiving diligence: 1- Proving yourself trustworthy 2- Helping event leaders in several occasions 3- Always trying hard to make the clan a better place 4- Attending Clan Wars events and other special events. 5- Actively taking part on Skilling and other special competitions. 6- Being always polite in chat and ready to welcome new members 7- Actively guiding and helping people in the clan chat or Teamspeak 8- Helping in reporting the rule breakers and encouraging the helpers 9- Showing and proving your leadership abilities by making the difference in any event 10- Always solving issues and never been in a dispute with anyone. No clan rules broken  \u00a0 The following will decrease your chances of receiving diligence: 11- Being negative and pessimistic about current state and future of the clan. 12-Trolling, being disrespectful, or being immature will make it rather impossible to receive Diligence. 13- Being one part of any argument for any reason will decrease your chances of receiving diligence. 14- Requesting clarification on how diligence is earned or requesting making diligence easier to earn. 15- Constantly bringing up problems and things that are wrong within the clan without providing viable solutions. 16- Violating any clan rules in any way, in clan chat, teamspeak or other places will result in much lower chance of getting diligence. 17- Contacting leaders directly or indirectly about your diligence. [You're encouraged to talk to provide feedback and promote other people to the leaders, but never promote yourself directly or indirectly for diligence] Mentality (3) Having logical, innovative, and leadership abilities can earn you up to three Diligence. Activity (3) Being outstanding and regularly active at events will earn you up to three Diligence. (Mainly taking part in Skilling competition, High level PVM, Wars, and other events) Integrity (4) Being honest, polite and welcoming, in addition to encouraging clan rules for an extended period can earn you up to four Diligence. Others Having 72 on your name and achieving Coordinator rank will award you +1 Diligence. Receiving 500M and 1B clan xp will grant you +2 Diligence overall (+1 each). Being a staff member with at least 20 Staff Points and having been in the clan for at least 3 years will grant you +1 Diligence. You are required to provide concrete evidence as your name being listed on Events Led of the past, your application being present on forum, your name found on a capping document on Facebook, your date of joining Facebook, or any other concrete proof. Annual Diligence Rewards: The accomplishments listed below may give you only one diligence in a lifetime. That means you cannot receive best skiller of the year diligence twice in two years. In addition, you may only receive +1 diligence and not more from the ones with asterisk in a given year. That means if you were both the best skiller and the best staff, you may only choose to receive diligence from one of the two! Every year, the most distinct staff member receives +1 Diligence. That staff member is chosen by having at least 10SP, been part of the staff for at least 8 months in that year, and maintained the highest average PF of anyone else until the end of that year. Becoming the best skiller of the year will grant you +1 Diligence. Being one of the two people with the most appearance at Special events in a year, will grant you +1 Diligence. Special events include all inter-clan events, and high-level PVM. (Clan Wars, Minigames with other clans, Vorago, Rise of the Six). Note: Diligence has a certain limited time of upkeep. Members who do not have their activity requirements met for an extended period tend to lose Diligence over time.Valor  Ranking up in The 72 Clan requires more than just Diligence and Prestige. Members are also required to gather Valor points to be able to rank up within the clan. Valor is earned by joining the 72 Clan Staff. All members, regardless of their rank are capable of joining the Staff and signing up for positions. Valor Points System is in position to ensure that there will always be people who help provide for the community, and that all our Staff get rewarded based on their performance and commitment. Please note that Valor gain begins after trial for a position has been passed, so if you are aiming to achieve a high rank in 72, you might want to think ahead of time as passing trial and learning the basics of a position may take some time. Every rank above Captain requires a certain amount of Valor. Every month, all Captain+ lose a very small portion of that Valor as depicted in the cart below. Valor can be gained depending on the amount of responsibility successfully held by a Staff member. Valor gained in a month is calculated by the following formula: [Number of Staff Points]*[Performance Factor]*[0.5]Valor Maintenance Chart  The table above illustrates the minimal amount of Staff Points required by a staff member, given the hypothetical Performance Factors. The first column on the left represents the amount of Valor that is lost monthly depending on your rank. The chart on the right simply shows how much responsibility, measured in Staff Points, a staff member would need to hold, in order to maintain his/her Valor. To help understand the table, here is further explanation. If you are currently a General who has 10 Valor in the clan, you will lose 2 Valor every month that goes on. That means if you're a General who has no affiliations with the clan, you will lose your Valor in 5 months, since you are losing 2 monthly. Therefore, in order to maintain your Valor, you will most probably need to take a position or different positions that sum up to somewhere between 5 to 10 Staff Points. To gain more Valor for your future rank, say you're aiming for Coordinator, you're recommended to take somewhere between 12 to 25 Staff Points. Staff Members with Valor below their rank's minimal requirement for 2 months will lose their rank! All Staff Members are obligated to provide feedback about their own or someone else's PF if they noticed an error.Responsibilities of All Ranks Recruit  Being a recruit is being the foundation of the clan. If recruits know and understand all the main things required for earning higher ranks, they will be able to succeed and climb the rank hierarchy in no time! All recruits must have read and understood Recruits' Preparation and Admission Details. Recruits are also expected to inform the leaders about anything that may bother them or may need improving in the cc. Staff positions as Event Leader Assistant, Clan Chat Assistant, Teamspeak Assistant, Vexileer, Warlord Assistant, Staff Board Secretary, PVM Leader, Warbands Assistant, Recruitment Secretary, and Clan Chat Organizer are all available to Recruit+ members.Corporal  Achieving corporal may be an easy task for most of the members. Corporals are generally of the members who occasionally attend events, cap at citadel, and aid the recruits and guests with possible questions. Corporal+ have the ability to lead official Dungeoneering events for the clan. Every 2 weeks, two of the most polite and friendly Corporals+ are chosen to be promoted to admin for 5 unlimited length times within 2 weeks (logout limit of 20mins), just to thank them and encourage their outstanding behavior. In the Staff Positions, Teamspeak Organizer, Wikia and Docs Editor, Dungeoneering Leader, PVP Leader and Minigames Leader are also available to Corporal+ members of the clan.Sergeant  Sergeants are the newly selected diligent members. They will be expected to keep their clan leader added on Facebook. This enables them to pm the leader about the possible problems that occur away from his presence within the clan. Sergeant Rank in 72 is comparable to Captain Rank in ordinary Runescape clans. Sergeant+ in 72 are generally required to host at least one event every three weeks, be highly active in clan chat, or recruit active members for the clan. Sergeant+ in 72 will be able to take on positions as Recruitment assistant, Facebook and Docs Secretary, and High-level PVM Coordinator.Lieutenant  Achieving the Lieutenant rank is a huge step into becoming part of the main leaders of 72. Becoming a Lieutenant in 72 would take lots of effort, time, and dedication. Lieutenant+ in 72 are members whose existence will always be felt within 72, as they have brought certain eternal changes to the clan, in one way or another. Members who achieve Lieutenant+ will not be able to lose their rank within 72, unless they are demoted in certain rare cases. Lieutenant+ in 72 are generally active in either hosting events, recruitment, clan chat, or organizing Facebook and other key departments of 72 clan. All Lieutenant+ of 72 clan have the right to take on constructive positions as Impromptu Event Organizer, Warbands Coordinator, Competition Organizer and Recruitment Coordinator, within the 72 Clan Staff Organization.Captain  Captains tend to take more responsibilities and dedication into organizing events, assisting guests and members in clan chat, and overseeing the current staff, in comparison to Lieutenants of the clan. Captain+ have the capability to oversee and replace almost all Event Leaders. They also are given the ability to edit the 72 Clan Calendar; therefore, you will be able to ask them for moving or editing your Official Events on Google Calendar. Captain+ members are given the opportunity to vote for three of the most sociable Corporal+ members to be given the opportunity to hold avatar for 5 times within 2 weeks. The most beneficial aspect of receiving Captain Rank is the ability to be promoted to Admin for any given time. Captain+ may ask Organizer+ ranks to be temporarily given Admin rank to hold avatar for certain needs. Certainly, as all high ranks, those who take advantage of their power will be instantly demoted. Captain+ members of the clan has the potential to sign up for positions as Calendar Organizer, and Event Coordinator.General  Generals in 72 are generally considered the most prestigious members after the Deputy Leaders of the clan (Admin+). Positions as Warlord and Citadel Organizer are available only to General or higher ranked members in 72.Admin  Admins are considered as lower ranked deputies, but maintain their abilities as full leaders of the clan. All Admin+ have the privilege of taking roles as Clan Avatar Warden and Facebook and Docs Coordinator.Organizer  Organizer ranks are considered as mid-level Deputy Leaders of 72 Clan. Very few players have ever been able to achieve this rank. Organizer+ members are generally contacted by Captain+ for being temporarily promoted. Organizer+ are also in charge of temporarily promoting the Corporals who are voted out for being outstanding in Clan Chat. Members who have achieved this rank may apply for every single position available to Staff Members, including Staff Coordinator position.Coordinator+  Coordinator, Overseer, and Deputy Owner ranked members are considered as the highest ranked players of 72 Clan. A person who actually achieves any of these ranks in 72 will be considered as the highest ranked member of the clan. These ranks provide nothing but more authority/responsibility in the clan.Ranking Advantages  As you earn promotion, you'll indeed be gaining more responsibilities. Aside from that, you'll be receiving respect, due to your higher rank, and also certain extra privileges in the clan. Any person misusing his rank will be demoted instantly. As a Recruit, you are given the advantages of: As a Corporal, you are given all advantages of Recruits plus: As a Sergeant, you are given all advantages of Corporals plus: As a Lieutenant, you are given all advantages of Sergeants plus: As a Captain, you are given all the advantages of Lieutenants plus: As a General, you are given all advantages of Captains plus: As an Admin, you are given all advantages of Generals plus: As an Organizer, you are given all advantages of an Admin plus: As a Coordinator, you are given all advantages of an Organizer plus:Prevailing Staff Members  This list is based on the people who have passed trial for joining the Clan Staff with more than 10 Staff Points as the sum of their Trial and Passed trial. This section remains under construction due to the update in clan staff system.Events Concept General Concept  Our clan events are considered extremely important. Each day that goes by, at least one event has been led within the 72 Clan. The event leaders are required to have an outstanding consistency, determination, and patience in order to be part of the clan's leaders and staff. Overall, events are considered as one of the most important segments of the clan. Within the clan we have official and unofficial events. Official events are events that happen with a trend (once weekly, twice weekly, etc), while unofficial events have no specific trends and can be led by any clan member, at any time. An event may only be considered as Offiical only if it has a trend, or if it is being completed as part of Supplementary Operations in Clan Staff. To become a part of the 72 staff (events or otherwise), apply here.PVM Events  As PVM are considered to be one of the most popular kind of events, certain factors are to be noted to all clan members regarding these entertaining yet sometimes controversial events. The 72 clan members are essentially forbidden to crash other teams while PVMing since they represent the clan, and we as a clan aim to improve the community. Hence, we do not want people who enjoy crashing others representing us. During clan events, official or unofficial, event leaders are not allowed to crash other teams, however, peaceful resolution and agreement with the other PVM parties is totally acceptable. In order to enhance the concept of fair gameplay and equal loot distribution, 72 clan members should always be cautious about their LSP (Lootshare Points) and be sure to have low LSP before attending events. Basic ruling on high lootshare points is that depending on the attendees and leaders, we may allow people with high lsp to stay, but only if 70% or more of attendees want them to stay. Minor Staff's opinion is considered as +5%, Major Staff and event leader's is taken as +10%. For example, if Ebram 72 has high lsp and there are total of 11 attendees including him, one event leader, one major staff and one minor staff, if seven people want him to stay he can stay. If six people including a major staff want him to stay, he can stay. If six people, including two minor staff members wanted, he can stay. We can judge a person's LSP by either having them admit, or noticing that every single drop for four kills went to them, or a significant share in all valuable drops in six kills. If a person misses a huge split for turning off lootshare, all attendees are required to give him an equal share. Anti-crashing is a commonly disputed concept in our PVM events. It is highly encouraged between all clan members, and awarded with an attendance permit in addition to two Prestige points, for your short but valuable service. The attendance permit will award you from one to seven Prestige points, depending on the event that you attend. Clan leaders are always highly encouraged not to call for anti-crash, and to try their best to form a peaceful resolution. If in distress, the leaders must remember to call for anticrash, put down current attendance, note the newcomers, and award them with anticrash recognition. Members who get there later than required will not be awarded any points, so before calling anti-crash, leaders must organize the numbers and be sure to get confirmation from those who are coming to help.Unofficial Events  As already mentioned, all clan members are able to host events unofficially within the clan. Although the are usually less organized than official events, there are some guidelines that can be followed in order to achieve better attendance and integrity for these events, such as: The attendees and leader of an unofficial event are able to get Prestige Points only if the 5 or more people attended the event, including the leader. If the leader is a Staff Member, the minimal amount of people is reduced to 4. If the event lasts less than 60 minutes, it will not be considered as an unofficial event. If you manage to host an unofficial event, following all guidelines above, definitely consider becoming a part of the Clan Staff!  \u00a0Special Events  Certain events, such as learner events and Inter-clan events, provide leaders a higher level of difficulty when it comes to hosting. That is why these events have a mandatory requirement for Teamspeak and early preparation. The top two members of the clan to have attended and led these events each year will be eligible for 1 diligence!  \u00a0Avatar Wardens  In 72 clan, all members, regardless of their rank, have the possibility of taking on the role of an Avatar Warden through the biweekly merit system. The merit system enables Corporal+, and very rarely Recruits, who are highly social, hospitable, and friendly in clan chat and/or teamspeak to be voted for by Captain+ (and Corporal+ with given Staff Points listed below), and given the opportunity to hold an Avatar during a two weeks period. The voted members are required to inform any Organizer+ whenever they want the avatar, and they will be given the permission while they are holding the avatar. The permission will be revoked if the nominee is not holding avatar for 30mins. Once a member achieves Captain rank in 72, or are a\u00a0Corporal who has passed 20 Staff Points, a Sergeant with 15SP, or a Lieutenant 10SP, \u00a0they are able to hold avatar for any length (unlike the voted people who get 2 weeks period). The aforementioned have to follow the same procedure and contact Organizer+ for the rank, and will also get demoted for not holding avatar for 30mins. Admin+ reserve the right to hold avatar whenever they want, and may go outside clan homeworld with avatar, if they need it for a special purpose that can't be done in W72, or if there is an Avatar already available on W72. Due to the temperamental nature of the avatars, the water avatar should always be on w72 or in the citadel, and if an avatar is to be taken off-world, another avatar should be used. In order to help keeping world 72 under the effect of an avatar, Organizer+ may have any past Avatar Warden hold it in world 72, if there is none out there already. These selected Avatar Wardens will get temporary permission to hold avatar, and they may hold it only in world 72. Past Avatar Wardens should not ask for temporary admin rank to hold avatar in any world other than 72; they also should not ask for temporary admin rank to hold avatar in world 72 if there is no avatar in this world; they may, though, inform Organizers+ that there is no avatar bonus within world 72, leaving with them the responsibility of having someone hold it there. This system has the potential to affect the incentive people have for ranking up, which is why anyone who is higher rank may request avatar from lower ranks at any time if the pool is empty. Alternatively, the lower ranks can take the avatar to where the higher rank requests if they are not willing to dismiss it for the higher ranks to hold. So in summary, if you want to hold avatar in 72, you need to meet the following criteria: Recruit+ => Voted through merit Corporal => Voted through merit or passed 20 Staff Points Sergeant => Voted through merit or passed 15 Staff Points Lieutenant => Voted through merit or passed 10 Staff Points Captain or General => Able to ask for avatar from Organizer+ Admin or higher => Able to hold avatar at any timeSkilling Competitions and Daily XP Attainment  In 72 clan, there are 2 types of skilling competitions: Weekly Elected Competitions and Monthly Overall Competitions.

Thank you to Div and Litewarior for putting them together. If you have never done Vorago before, please be sure to check a guide before you go. To see a great written guide on Vorago, please click here, phase 3 depends on the week, ask your host for info. Please feel free to do some research outside of the game as well through\u00a0 twitch.tv or youtube. A series of all inclusive guides can be found here. A new dps guide can be found here, this details how to do 4 mans but it is very very informative.Roles  There are 4 roles required to fight Vorago, some are harder then others, but all are extremely necessary as you will need to work together to win the fight. A team typically consists of 6-8 people, 1 base tank, 1 bomb tank and the rest DPSers.The first two roles are that of a tank.Base Tank  The first tank is referred to as the base tank, his/her job is to absorb the majority of the melee damage so that his team can focus on damage output. Base tanking should not be done without knowledge on the topic. Although it is a more forgiving position, it has many jobs that need to be accomplished for a successful kill. Some of which include, luring for the jumper, organizing and being the first in the voke order, and standing on the north end of the island on the final phase so that his teammates take less damage. The base tank is to use a shield every phase but the final one, as his damage is required to finish the kill. A strategy that can be used by a base tank is to use heal other on his team mates when he uses the defensive ability barricade, this will make for much easier kills. It is highly advised that an experienced player takes this role.Bomb Tank  The second tank is referred to as the bomb tank. Their job is to stand the furthest away from Vorago, as Vorago normally targets the farthest target with bombs. The bomb tank can either have Sagaies or a Seismic wand, but a shield is REQUIRED for the ENTIRE kill. The bomb tank typically survives off shield abilities such as resonance or reflect, as well as doing as much damage they can muster whilst staying at a comfortable level of health and prayer. Blue bombs can be resonanced and have reducible damage. Red bombs will deal more damage based on however many players they hit, and they can not be blocked with any means other then barricade, as they deactivate defensive abilities. ALL players should stand closer to Vorago then the bomb tank, or else they will be doing the tank's job for them. The use of a Ascension crossbow allows for the casting of heal other much like stated in the base tank's section. It is also important to note that if a team has 11 or more people, 2 bomb tanks will be required. It is highly advised a somewhat experienced player does this role.DPS  As a damage dealer, you have two jobs. Kill Vorago, and don't kill anyone else. Damage dealers make up the majority of the team. Typically the one who does the most damage in a phase, will get a drop to show for it, so do as much damage as you possibly can in all phases to maximize profit. Every phase but 3 and 5 can be done with a shield as damage doesn't matter, but it is recommended that you do as much damage as you can while taking into account reflects and the weekly rotation, as you may kill a teammate and lose the kill. Something to note, is that if you are using magic or range: you wont take much - or any damage. You can stand away from the bomb tank and the base tank, and turn on soul split or even use zealots freely. Just be weary of your role in the voke order, random red bombs, and weekly attacks.Jumper/Mauler  The role of a jumper is simple, but it requires a ranged weapon. Your only job is to help lure, and then jump on Vorago in phase one. The second the first phase begins, make a break for the rocks on the west wall. From there you will agility your way to the ledge as the base tank/lurer will line Vorago up for you to attack and provoke it into position. You are to stand 2 spaces north and 2 spaces west of the peak when you attack/provoke Vorago so that when you do, he lines up just right for you to jump. The base tank will then provoke from the south, allowing him to be jumped on. It is best to jump when he is around 30,000 health, as he will regenerate if he is lower. When you jump, drop the maul piece and resume your role as a DPS. The role of a Mauler can be given to anyone but the bomb tank. Your only job is to take the maul on the final phase, and spam click it when Vorago nears the edge of the island. If you miss a chance to finish the kill, the kill can easily be lost. So try extremely hard to finish it before and when the opportunity arises.Equipment Base Tank  Helm:Tetsu > Malevolent >Torva Neck: Amulet of Souls>Reaper Necklace>Dragon Rider/Whisper > Fury Body: Tetsu > Malevolent > Torva Legs: \u00a0Tetsu > Malevolent > Torva Primary Weapon: Drygore Mace > Drygore L/R Offhand options(For final phase): Drygore Off-H M/L/R Shield options: Divine Spirit Shield/ Malevolent Kiteshield> Chaotic Kiteshield\u00a0 Cape: Comp > Tokhaar-kal-ket > Max Cape > Skill Gloves:\u00a0Static > Razorback Boots: Torva > Steadfast Ring: Vigour > Ring of Death > Warriors(i)/Onyx(i) > Sixth age circuit > Warriors > Berserker Auras:\u00a0Invigorate > Vampyrism > Penance > Reverence Pocket slot: Attacker's Insignia > Scrimshaw of attack WITH 99 DIV > Scrimshaw of vampyrism > Sign of life Note:Bomb Tank  Helm: Seasingers / Death Lotus Neck: Amulet of Souls > Arcane Stream > Hiss >\u00a0Dragon Rider/Murmur > Ranging > Fury Body: Seasingers / Death Lotus Legs: Seasingers / Death Lotus Primary Weapon: Seismic wand > Sagaies > Virtus wand / Ascension Shield options:\u00a0 Arcane/Elysian > Merciless / Vengeful Cape: Comp >Tokhaar Mej/Tokhaar-Kal Xil> Max > God/avas>skillcape Gloves: Tracking Gloves/Static Gloves Boots: Glaiven Boots/Ragefire Boots Ring: Vigour > Ring of Death > Leviathan > Onyx(i) >\u00a0Sixth age circuit/Berserker(i) >\u00a0Seer's(i) > Berserker\u00a0>\u00a0Seer's\u00a0 Auras:\u00a0 Penance > Reverence > Vampirism Pocket slot: Attacker's Insignia > Sign of life Note: For Beast of Burden, it should be filled with rocktails with a unicorn pouch and scrolls for when it runs outMelee DPS  (REQUIRES SPECIAL DISPENSATION BY THE EVENT LEADER TO USE) Helm: Malevolent > Torva > Tetsu Neck: Amulet of Souls > Reaper Necklace > Dragon Rider > Fury Body: Malevolent > Torva > Tetsu Legs: Malevolent > Torva > Tetsu Primary Weapon: Drygore Mace > Drygore L/R > Noxious Scythe Offhand options: Drygore Off-H M/L/R Shield options: Malevolent Kiteshield > Chaotic Kiteshield > Divine Spirit shield Cape: Comp >\u00a0Tokhaar-kal-Ket > Max > Skill Gloves: Razorback > Torva >Pneumatic Boots: Torva > Steadfast\u00a0 Ring: Vigour > Ring of Death > Warriors(i)/Onyx(i) > Sixth age circuit > Warriors > Berserker Auras:\u00a0Invigorate > Vamp >\u00a0Penance\u00a0>\u00a0Reverence Pocket slot: Scrimshaw of Attack > Attacker's Insignia > Scrimshaw of Vampirism > Sign of life Note: For Beast of Burden, it should be filled with rocktails with a unicorn pouch and scrolls for when it runs outMage DPS  Helm: Void (With full set) > Tectonic >\u00a0Virtus\u00a0 > Subjugation > Seasingers\u00a0 Neck: Amulet of Souls > Reaper Necklace > Dragonrider > Fury Body: Void (With full set) >\u00a0Tectonic >\u00a0Virtus\u00a0 > Subjugation > Seasingers\u00a0 Legs:\u00a0Void (With full set) >\u00a0Tectonic >\u00a0Virtus\u00a0 > Subjugation > Seasingers\u00a0 Primary Weapon: Noxious Staff > Seismic wand Offhand options: Seismic singularity/Virtus Book WITH SEISMIC WAND Shield options: Merciless Kiteshield > Farseer's Kiteshield > Arcane Cape: Comp > Tokhaar-kal-mej > God > Max \u00a0> Skill Gloves:\u00a0Void (With full set) > Spellcaster > Celestial Handwraps > Virtus > Subjugation >\u00a0\u00a0Static Gloves Boots: Virtus > Subjugation >\u00a0Ragefire Boots Ring: Vigour > Ring of Death > Onyx(i) >\u00a0Sixth age circuit/Berserker(i) >\u00a0Seer's(i) > Berserker\u00a0>\u00a0Seer's\u00a0 Auras:\u00a0Runic Accuracy > Invigorate > Dark Magic > Vamp >\u00a0Reverence Pocket slot: Scrimshaw of Magic > Scrimshaw of Elements > \u00a0Sign of life Note: For Beast of Burden, it should be filled with rocktails with a unicorn pouch and scrolls for when it runs outRanged DPS  Helm:\u00a0Void (With full set) >\u00a0Sirenic > Pernix > Armadyl > Death Lotus\u00a0 Neck: Amulet of Souls > Reaper Necklace > Dragonrider > Fury Body:\u00a0Void (With full set) >\u00a0Sirenic > Pernix > Armadyl > Death Lotus\u00a0 Legs:\u00a0Void (With full set) >\u00a0Sirenic > Pernix > Armadyl > Death Lotus\u00a0 Primary Weapon: Ascension Crossbow/Noxious Bow > Death Lotus Darts Offhand options: Ascension Crossbow > Death Lotus Darts > Offhand Chaotic Crossbow (WITH MAINHAND ASCENSION) Shield options: Vengeful Kiteshield > Eagle-Eye Kiteshield > Elysian Spirit Shield Cape: Comp > Tokhaar-kal-xil >\u00a0Ava's\u00a0 >\u00a0Max\u00a0> Skill Gloves:\u00a0Void (With full set) >\u00a0Ascension grips > Deathtouch Bracelet > Pernix > Armadyl Gloves Boots: Pernix > Armadyl Boots >\u00a0Glaiven Boots Ring: Vigour > Onyx(i) >\u00a0Sixth age circuit/Berserker(i) >\u00a0Archer's(i) > Berserker\u00a0>\u00a0Archer's\u00a0 Auras:\u00a0Sharpshooter > Invigorate > Vamp >\u00a0Reverence Pocket slot: Scrimshaw of Ranging > Scrimshaw of Cruelty> Attacker's Insignia > Sign of life Note: For Beast of Burden, it should be filled with rocktails with a unicorn pouch and scrolls for when it runs outVorago FAQ  1.

These camps are founded to gain an advantage for the followers of a particular God once their God returns. They will set up camp in the Wilderness every 7 hours, one time at each of the three locations. Quercus, an ancient seer Ent, will send out adventurers to fight in the camps to balance the followers of the different Gods in Guthix's name. Quercus can be found just outside the Grand Exchange agility shortcut. Warband events are synchronised on each world and can give you up to 300k experience per day depending on your skill level. Warbands grant experience in a number of skills, depending on which tents are available at the time and which tents you choose to take loot from. You can loot 25 different supplies from one camp (only 3 kind of supplies available in the camp) and if you're lucky, you can loot Wand of treachery. You can trade your supplies for rewards with quercus; the maximum number of supplies you can have is 75 supplies per day. Besides the experience reward, the supplies can also be handed in for 4,000 coins each, totaling 300,000 coins per day if you get all 75 supplies. If a player manages to kill someone with supplies in the Wilderness they can pick them up. The supplies can be given to Quercus for either experience in the skills the supplies belong to or 4000 coins for each item. Since skills like smithing and farming are considered expensive skills to train trading in supplies for XP is by far the most common option especially since the coin value is significantly less than the XP is worth (based on coins per xp in those skills). Several different rewards may be acquired:Locations  Warbands happen in 3 locations:Minimum Requirements  \u00bb Weapon: 70+ melee, 75+ ranged or 70+ magic \u00bb Helm: 60+ \u00bb Body: 60+ \u00bb Legs: 60+ \u00bb Cape: Current Team Cape only \u00bb Gloves: 60+ \u00bb Boots: 60+ \u00bb Ring: Ring of Wealth with charges \u00bb Amulet: Phoenix necklaces \u00bb Familiar: Beast of Burden - War Tortoise / Pack YakRecommended Gear setup Scouts  Scouts are extremely helpful and necessary for a warband to be successful. They give up their time and possibly loot in order to allow the looters to have a successful warbands and get their 75/75. Please thank the scouts whenever you can as they have given up their time and loot so you can have the higher amount of experience as possible. Always\u00a0listen out for scout calls, the scouts will usually repeat themselves so do not ask for location, tents etc. We also have a guide underneath for all first time scouters and those scouts who aren't 100% confident of what to do.Scout Guide  Okay so you've decided to scout but you're not sure what to do. This guide should take you through the basics and what you should do if it doesn't go smoothly.Final Notes  If scouting, try and keep yourself cool and stay focused on the objective. If the beam gets broken, do not blame yourself, it happens all the time and you shouldn't feel bad about it. However, try your best to kill the people who break the beam and try to get people there as quick as possible as the camp only lasts for 5 minutes if the beam gets broken (10 minutes for beam complete). Finally, just have fun, scouting is an enjoyable thing to do and if you enjoy what you do, you will be sure to succeed, just don't panic, keep your cool. Your BOB familiar carry food, potions and phoenix necklaces (you should have 25 free spaces in your inventory if you are going to loot the supplies). Always be ready for war and help your Friends Chat to kill all white dotes, but do not chase them and stick together as a team. if u get the wand be aware of wand pkers because you will be without prayers and a player with any combat level can attack you. If you need help finding a FC for warbands or have any questions, please contact the Staff Members that hold the positions Warbands Assistant or Warbands Coordinator. Contact any Staff Member to know who these assistants/coordinators are. Last Observations:The 72 Clan's FAQ  1- How did you guys come about calling the clan 72? Number 72 is totally a symbolic number. It includes the two numbers of 7 and 2. 7 is symbol of luck, wisdom and consciousness, while 2 represents balance, union and partnership. Having a clan name with only two letters will also reduce the possible spam in the clan chat. Random cool facts about the number itself: 2- Can I start my own events? Yes, you can. We have an unofficial and official events' systems, which allows for staff and non-staff to host events. Official events are very organized, take place on a certain time and day, and led by experts who pass the event leadership trials, while unofficial events are led by anyone who has basic idea of what the event should focus on and are more casual. All events should be fun and interesting to the attendees. If you feel you want to step up your responsibilities and rewards up, you are able to apply to join for 72 Clan Staff. By doing so, you will be recognized as a staff member and gain many bonus previliges, such as moving people on Teamspeak, having your own specialized Teamspeak Icon, getting the right to take clan avatar out, and much more! 3- What is the clan motto? What does it mean? \"Honor for all, hatred for none; power in Integrity, Unity, Felicity and Liberty\" is our clan's motto. Honor for all signifies that we show respect and honor for all people regardless of who they are or what they own. We never hate other people. We believe that educating the ignorant will solve many problems; hating makes them worse. Our strength comes from four main pillars. Integrity or honesty between the clan members is a must. Unity makes progress. Liberty and freedom motivates the members to be their best and achieve their maximum. Felicity or happiness, being the most important pillar, is the main reason for our clan's existence. The clan is supposed to enhance the joy one can earn from the game; if it fails to do so, there will be no reason for someone to stay in our clan. 4- How old is our clan? Our clan was founded by the day of release of Clan Citadels (26 /July /2011). Our clan was initially a 0+ clan which was made mainly for simple fun events, a social community and an active citadel. Later we added PVM and Minigames to our events. Having determined members, the clan grew with time. New systems and constitutions were formed to enable a successful and a flawless future. Many members left and many new ones joined; many hardships and burdens have been endured for us to be where we are now. We are thankful to all our members who were loyal to, and believed, in us. Clan 72 shall never perish\u00a0:). 5- How do you track the Prestige, Diligence and Valor? Everything is led through Google Docs and Facebook. That includes announcements, Prestige, voting system, temporary idle list, Diligence, Valor, event attendance, and suggestions. Click on the following hyperlink to be redirected to the Facebook Page. 6- Who made this wikia page? The events section requires constant update done by our Event Coordinator and our Event leaders. Overall proof-reading and quality assurance has constantly been provided by various staff members and even ordinary clan members, with Elf Mathews providing possibly the most amount of feedback and modifications. Besides that, 'along with Facebook, Google Docs, Google Calendar, and Teamspeak, this wikia page has been designed by Ebram 72 for the most part. Many others have been also helpful in the creation whose names can be found on the credits section.'Credits  Ebram 72 Uaexkiller RawrKyle Hooded Roar Div Elf Mathews Cla rk Doomles 72Player vs Monster  Player vs. Environment, colloquially known as PvE, is the aspect of killing monsters as opposed to Player killing. PvE events are very common for clans with higher level members.PvE Events  Many players often choose to battle multi-combat bosses, which occur in large-scale areas, such as the God Wars Dungeon. PvE groups, in which players team up to conquer a single boss, often use the combat triangle to provide effective killing.List of Common PvE events Clan  A Clan, sometimes known as a player Guild or Nation, is an organised syndicate of players who choose to participate in one or more group events such as: player killing, training skills, and other activities. Clans often have complex relations with others (such as rivalries and alliances) and some participate within a Union or Alliance. There are two main classes of clans. The newer-class clans are based on the RuneScape clan forums, and commonly referred to as RSB clans (RuneScape Boards). The older-class clans pre-date Jagex's clan support features, and many had separate forums and websites. For multi-clan communication, these clans based themselves on the forums of popular fansites, and were referred to for whichever they advocated: main ones being RSC clans (Zybez/RuneScape Community), TIF clans (Rune Tips/Tip.It) and RHQ clans (RuneHQ). It should be noted that while many clan websites and forums are totally harmless, players should still exercise extreme caution.Introduction  Clans are a group of players who strive for one or more goals, which vary between the different types of clan. Warring is a big part of the clanning community, as the goal of many PvP clans is to constantly grow in terms of strength, numbers, organisation, and other clan vs clan attributes (These clans who focus on rank-climbing are known as powerhouse clans). Traditional wars often occur at the Clan Wars Arena or the Wilderness. There are many different types of wars - typical varying elements of a war are the clan's Pay-to-Play or Free-to-Play status, member caps and the use of returning (and in some cases time caps). Clans will often use a ranking scheme within the Clan Chat. This will often mean the General (Gold star) in the clan chat is most probably a leader or higher ranked, more experienced player in the clan compared to a Recruit (One stripe). With a higher rank you may get the ability to kick other players out of the clan chat, which is often used to remove rule-breaking members or spammers. Another feature of a Clan Chat is Lootshare or Coinshare which converts valuable drops from high-level monsters into gold, and splits it respectively to the clan members. The killing of high level monsters within a clan often means it is a PvM (Player vs Monster) clan - however it is not uncommon for other types of clans such as PvP to host \"boss-hunting\" trips.Jagex Clan Support  In recent years, Jagex has recognised the clan world with the introduction of clan support, mainly with in-game features such as the Clan Wars arena and Clan Camp.Clan Chat  Clan Chat, initialised CC, is an in-game feature created by Jagex, based around organisation and communication withing a clan. It requires the registration of the clan in-game, which takes at minimum five players (see Clan Camp). All members in the clan will be displayed and able to speak in the CC while online (there is currently no feature to hide one's self from fellow clanmates), and will be displayed on the clan's on-site member list. The feature is considered a crucial element to clans, and plays a vital role in aspects such as Clan Wars. The old Clan Chat was renamed to \"Friends Chat\" with the release of the Clan Camp. It offers similar facilities such as Loot/Coinshare and the ranks system - however there are less restrictions. Interaction with a Friends Chat does not affect one's Clan Chat.Clan Camp  On 12 April 2011 Jagex implemented a game update that added various features to the game to support clans. These features include:Off-Site Software  Before the release of Clan Support, clans had to find other ways of supporting themselves. The use of off-site features has always been very popular. Separate forums (and in past years entire websites) are the most common. For real-time communication, chat programs such as IRC (Internet Relay Chat) are used, and for voice communication (a crucial element in PvP and PvM situations), programs like TeamSpeak, Ventrilo, Skype or Mumble are advocated. It should be noted that players should exercise extreme caution when considering the use of third-party software.Types of Clans  There many different types of clans that help their members do/achieve different things. The four most prominenent groups are PvP (Player vs Player, or Warring), PvM (Player vs Monster, or Boss-Hunting, Skilling and Community.PvP Clans  A PvP or Warring clan's main focus is combat-based, generally in the Wilderness or Clan Wars. The clans of the PvP clan world have many variations in style and features, and the top clans can mass hundreds of members to a battle and fight for hours on end.PvM Clans  A PvM (Player vs Monster) clan is a group based on killing high-level monsters such as the Corporeal Beast or Nex, a practice commonly known as \"boss-hunting\". Elite PvM clans are known to have high requirements (such as the use of Overload potions and the Turmoil curse).Skilling clans  A skilling clan is a clan that trains non-combat skills together. They have events where the clan will go to a RuneScape city/location and train a variety of skills that can be found there (e.g. Catherby, Falador, Rogue's Den). Other events include Skill Wars.Community Clans  These clans are very popular in RuneScape. Community (or Social/Chat) clans are clans of varied (race, gender, nationality) people that join a certain clan to chat. Chat discussions vary from Star Hunting to real-life business (although this is against Jagex rules).Merchanting Clans  A non-combat clan that focuses on playing the market to gain profit from investments in in-game commodities. Historically they were a collaboration of players who attempted to predict natural market shifts and making advantageous investments. They used to be fairly rare, since solo-trading was easier and in some cases more profitable. However, their numbers have gone up dramatically since the introduction of the Grand Exchange. These second generation merchanting clans (also known as \"price manipulation clans\") are significantly different than their predecessors. They do not rely on natural market fluctuations to raise and lower prices. Instead they pool their wealth together and buy out the entire stock of a particular item. This is intended to trigger a massive price increase due to the Grand Exchange picking up the increased (albeit artificial) demand. When the increasing price hits a certain mark, the clan sells their items, netting a profit.Activity clans  An activity clan is a clan of people cooperating in activities. In PvM activities such as Pest Control, this almost always entails winning the game. In PvP activities, however, they often deliberately tie games, which yields fewer points than playing an activity well and winning every time, but is guaranteed and requires little effort. Castle Wars, Stealing Creation and Soul Wars are the most common (safe) activities for clans to play. These types of clans often don't have very many requirements because they are based on fun, instead of winning, as is seen in PvP/Warring Clans.Questing clans  A questing clan is a clan with the sole purpose of doing quests together. This type of clan is normally very supportive and will have no requirements except for the skills needed to complete quests. These clans are rare to find because once the clan does a quest, they normally don't repeat it.Role-Playing clans  Role-playing clans, sometimes referred to as RP, is when players within a clan assume the identity of their RuneScape account as if it were real life. Players who role-play often develop non-canonical back-stories and histories for their characters. Many times they assign their character a home town and even an actual home, such as a mostly empty building. They may also assign their character a job whilst in game, dressing and acting as one would act if they really had such a job, sometimes by running personal shops.Player Owned City clans  Player Owned Cities (POCs), sometimes called Player Owned Countries, are a type of Role-Playing clans. Generally, player owned cities claim a certain area of land, ranging from a single city such as Keldagrim or Varrock to entire parts of Gielinor. In this area, the members role-play as though they actually live in the city, hosting events, opening shops, creating jobs, and governing their nation. POCs normally have a home world. In player cities, players generally take on one or more jobs, such as a fisherman, merchant, or warrior, which they do to gain personal wealth while aiding the city. Many cities also have military units and/or guards, which are stationed at entrances or key points of the region to watch for enemies and monitor the flow of visitors. Cities often try to distinguish themselves from clans, emphasizing their role-playing goals over more standard clan activities. The line between city and standard clan, however, is often difficult to distinguish. However some Player Owned Cities do normal clan events like Clan Wars or Castle Wars and do very little Role-Playing. Instead they use their \"territory\" as a base of operations.Help clans  Help Clans are clans dedicated to assisting players with any questions that they might have in game. A common misconception is that these clan are for new players, but they usually accept higher level players wholeheartedly. So as to answer their questions, and/or further the overall knowledge of the clan.Clan War  One of the oldest clan events is the clan war. While the Clan Wars Arena (CWA) is one option for wars, many fights are still done in the Wilderness because of tradition. Clan Wars is preferred though because clans can choose custom settings, such as the arena, if food/potions are allowed and even if player lose items upon death (which isn't used unless stakes aren't high). Another noteable feature of the Clan Wars arena is that it prevents interference from a non-participating clan, commonly known as \"crashing\". A typical war involves 2 or more clans meeting in a designated location at a designated date and time. The preparation and rules (such as boundaries) can vary, from a short-prep (less than an hour) to up to two or more weeks. The clans will then engage in battle. The definitions of a victory vary depending on the type of war. Usually wars are hosted between two clans (1v1), however in some cases aid can be provided from other clans (typically allies) if agreed upon.Full-Out War  A full-out war is one of the oldest types of fights hosted. Each clan will attempt to pull as many members as they can to the battle. Returning is not allowed in a full-out fight - once a member dies, they are \"out\", and may only return to watch. The clan who defeats all members of the opposition is declared the winner. In the Clan Wars Arena, a full-out is referred to as a \"Knock-out\".PK Run-In  A PK Run-In, or PKRI, is one of the more common types of fights, in which players are allowed to return and fight again upon death. A PKRI may have a time limit (cap), usually set between 30 minutes and two hours. If there is no limit (uncapped), the fight will go on until one clan stops returning (\"ending\") or they have no remaining fighters on the battlefield (\"cleared\"). The record time for longest PKRI is twenty-four hours between The Titans and Divine Forces.Union War  Union wars (or Ally Wars) are often fought in huge (sometimes 1000s of players) in either Clan Wars or in the Wilderness. They can be organised weeks in advanced between two or more unions which will have many clans in them. These wars can last hours because of the amount of people and are often very publicized within the RuneScape community. Winning a Union war could mean many things including 'ownership' of a particular RuneScape city (Player-Owned city, POC) or just to say that one union is better then another.Skill War  These wars do not involve player killing at all, but are instead a race. Clans compete against one another to determine who can gain the most experience or resources in a set amount of time.Metal War  Metal wars (also known as \"fun wars\", though the term does not strictly imply metal) are when clans agree to only wear a certain type of metal (i.e. Bronze, Iron, Steel, Black etc.) and are often carried out in the Wilderness due to tradition. Sometimes clans agree to use a better weapon (such as a Rune scimitar), in order to speed up the kill process. The presence of metal wars has diminished over the years, with more clans seeking out \"real\" fights - however, they are not extinct entirely.See also Guthix Blade  take a quick quiz!Recent News Intro  Guthix Blade is a clan created by Airblade86 (Sjblade on RuneScape). It is a F2P clan but included some P2P members.Naming  The clan name Guthix Blade is derived from:Our Motto  Being that it's our motto, we try to balance everything out.History  Here is a collection of the events in the making of the Guthix Blade.Rise of Dragon Blade  It was the first day when Jagex decided to create clans and Sjblade created one. It was originally named Dragon Blade but due to future events, it was changed.Forming The Alliance  It was during this time that Sjblade had invited some of his friends to this clan. No one knew it would have much members and the only few were low level players.Banishment of DanGK96  It was a normal day when we rendezvous in Varrock. DanGK96, a now banned member of our clan, started talking saying all these obscene and otherwise racist words in Clan Chat. Seeing that we cannot have such people in our clan, the Guthix Blade banned him forever.Reforming Dragon Blade  Due to the amount of \"noobs\" on the clan, some had to be taken off and after that, Sjblade added a new name to the clan and hoped to get some good members.Elite Bladers  The name Sjblade came up with was Elite Bladers and Sjblade started finding some more people.Sjgrenade's Proposal  One day, a player, Sjgrenade, wanted to join the Elite Bladers. He did not fit the requirements but offered some GP and was part of the clan. After a while, he asked if he could take the name of Elite Bladers and make it the name of his own clan. Sjblade who was already bored of the name said yes and now Sjgrenade is the owner of the Elite Bladers.The Third Name  The clan name was hard to come up with but Sjblade wanted it to have the word \"Guthix\" in it. The concept would not work because Guthix was a god of balance. The clan only had low level players and they were only warriors.TheMan0186 and Zwarrior1234  During a trip to Draynor Village, Sjblade met TheMan0186 who was desperately in need of armour. Sjblade gave him his Bronze Longsword and other various armours. (We were only level 20 at the time.) TheMan0186 was added to the clan and plus, he was a mage. TheMan0186 later led us to Zwarrior1234, another mage, who formerly was the most powerful member of the clan.Guthix Blade  The name Guthix could be used so many words were tried and only one sounded good enough\u2026Guthix Blade.Rise of Guthix Blade!!!  Guthix Blade today is receiving more and more players and will get better as time goes on\u2026The End of Guthix Blade?  Due to issues, Sjblade has decided to stop the clan and move on.

We have a variety of members in our clan, from level 3, to 132, to level 9002. The clan is mainly for chatting, but we play minigames often, and occasionally PvP and go revenant hunting. We don't wage wars on other clans, because wars usually end in gay spammings. No offence, but we like the peace.The TOTALLY EPIC HISTORY DOODZ In the beginning...  \"Hey, I decided to create an account named Bzpchat, to host its namesake\"\n- BZPower member Ziv, creator of our original clan channel. BZPchat was a clan channel created by Bio Raptor (named Ziv on BZPower) for the members of BZPower who enjoyed RuneScape to chat in. In its starting days, the chat gained a few members, but was soon forgotten and emptied out. One member remembered this ancient relic. In 2008, the time came for the First Annual BZPower Halloween Party. The attendees needed a clan to speak in, and the member put the name forward. Since then, it has become the home of the BZP'ers and an excellent community. A newer clan chat, known as BZP_Chat, was created by Kardas58 as a place where the members are ranked, for activities such as clan wars and lootsharing.The First Annual Halloween Party  \"fr33 muny plz@@@@@@@@@@@@@\"\n- about half the people that showed up at our f2p drop party. In October of 2008, it was decided that the need existed for the BZPers to meet up and engage in one of their favorite activities.... PARTY!!! Kayteen7 chose to organize the event (afterward he chose to no longer organize events). The party was to consist of a segment in FTP and PTP, each with a drop party. The first obstacle was time, as the BZPers are spread across the world and finding a time to suit all their needs was difficult. Kayteen picked a workable time, but misjudged the difference between Denmark time and EST, but disaster was evaded. Once everything was settled, members grabbed their costumes and prepared to meet up. The party started at Kayteen's house and people came. Most were dressed up, and only two *loljagexcensorlol* cool guys came as \"barrows brothers\" (yeah right...) and cheated in the dungeon onslaught. Much partying was there and general happiness. After festivities the clan decided to go to F2P and host a drop party. In total the members had accumulated over 3 million coins worth and went to drop it in Free to play. The following 10 minutes went from member's partying, to becoming a living hell of free players wanting to hoard rune daggers, runes and 700k gp.  After the party, the BZPers learned that three million coin drop parties in FTP were too terrible to be discussed, and that partying was a great deal offun. Kayteen developed a fear of developing events. But what the members didn't see, until it was too late, was that a new root of flaming evil missed the free party and was about to unleash months of splitting in the community...The Ice/Matas - P2P war  \"Why is it that all you guys talk about is members stuff?! I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE STRONGHOLD OF PLAYER SAFETY GOSH DARNIT!!!\"\n-Matas Shadeslayer/Icecold531 raising a philosophical question. In the beginning of November a massive flame war was started by the member Icecold531. Icecold felt that most members had forgotten that they were once f2p'ers, supplemented by the fact that he and Kay had met several members that thought free-players were tools for their own gain or just scum. This caused people to flame him back, and the war went on for months. To this day, most of it it forgotten as a thing of the past. Icecold is no longer a threat to the community of BZPchat as his computer was destroyed  in a horrible accident by a massive virus.The C O R S A M War  \"I DECLARE WAR ON THIS CLAN\"\n-C O R S A M, after joining our clan channel and shouting at us about a war. He was somehow talking in all caps. On July 1st BZPChat was feeling good. We had just gotten featured on the Runescape Clans Wiki and were slowly becoming respected. However lots of non-bzp noobs tried to join BZPChat, although they were denied they were all very respectful. One day, a member of the clan C O R S A M came into our clan channel requesting an alliance. We refused, and then after some events that I would appreciate somebody else filling in since I forget them, he declared war on us. After a secret meeting of the BZP council where nothing releveant was discussed it was decided that BZP would go to Clan Wars with C O R S A M. C O R S A M never showed up as Grunge Devil decided to call off the war. When asked for comments their leader, Grunge Devil, had the following to say (see pictures). Afterwards C O R S A M became extremely paranoid that BZP Chat would start a new war with them. We have no such intention of doing so. Some misleading rumors concerning another clan were also spread, but soon stopped. After the war, several members of BZP were bitter towards Corsam and continued insulting them, and not even as a joke. This was soon cleared up, however.The Second Matas Vs. Everyone Else War  \"Hey guys, my computer's fixed an-... WHY ARE YOU ALL TALKING ABOUT MENAGERIE'S GOSH DARN YOU!!!!\" - Matas saying hi to the members of BZPChat after getting a new computer. After C O R S A M asploded BZPChat was in it's 4th golden age. Then Matas's computer unasploded. For a while he seemed to have his memory erased by our s00pah secret ninjas \"forgiven our past sins\". However when the word noob was tossed around and Eey joke kicked him his head re-asploded and all of his memories of past \"torment\" came back like a flood of manufactured memories he declared war on us again. This conflict ended thanks to Reload's sensitive side, and Ice becoming a member.The Relocation  After a few more arguements with Ice and a staged fight between Law and Kay, BZPChat's headquarters (the Official RuneScape Topic on BZPower) was closed by an admin, forcing all of the members to relocate to a web forum created during one of BZPower's many downtimes, known as RunePingas. It is a thriving community where we discuss everything. Why we still call ourselves BZPChat, we may never know.The Many Quits, Returns, Requits, and Rereturns of Vaa  Over the course of several months after the closing of ORT (see The Relocation), Vaa repeatedly claimed to be quitting the clan. He succeeded on RS, but he still sticks with us. Who knows when he'll ever leave. Nowadays all he does is complain about us talking about RS, put his two cents into conversations about updates he's never tried, and posts hundreds of RunePingas topics about his games and rants.The Clan Today: Details and General Information  \"You guys can't take anything seriously, can you?\"\n\"No.\"\n- Grunge Devil and Kayteen7 after the former being met by spam and sailing while paying a visit. If you were to join BZPchat today, we have an average of 3 to 4 players in the channel. On busier days, we may have 10 or more people. Our home world is 67. For the most part, clan members train the Slayer skill and participate in conversations. Often, members will also be playing a minigame, such as the TzHaar Fight Caves or Soul Wars. The most unique thing about this clan stems from the personalities of its member, being odd, funny, and even rather insane at times. Members travel the world in groups, claiming areas as designated \"BZP Hideouts,\" spreading the good news of Sailing, and trying to create a happy atmosphere. The clan has since died out,RETURN OF THE CHAT AND DUBSTEP  After being horribly inactive for months, member Kayteen7 decided to follow up the huge succes that was the 2008 Halloween party and so hosted the event 2011 Halloween party (we're so good at coming up with original names). The party started in Kayteen7's 99 construction house where everyone was killing iron dragons in Kay's basement. The attenders also dressed up, and the award for the best costume went to Law who dressed up as Vegeta from Dragonball Z. The party went smoothly and was accompanied with the best dubstep. When the people decided they had had enough of partying they decided to do what they do worst: going to the Wilderness to kill people AKA pk'ing AKA pvp pk pro pvp kid imo tbh pvp pro sad dds pro. They suited up in their best gear (bronze) and headed out for the far-ends of the Wilderness. The Wilderness trip, however, didn't go as well as the party, since the only people they were able to kill were their own clan mates. This event will hopefully mark the return of the greatest clan in the history of RuneScape, so beware. Some Favorite Clan Activities Include:BZP's 99er Noobs Ranks  Everybody is ranked as a General to prevent arguing. If someone breaks the rules outlined below they will be de-ranked as soon as somebody with the power to do so is available, and can be kicked to stop the nuisance.Rules of BZPChat  The following rules must be obeyed or else there is no entry.Member List Most active members (not including alternate accounts)  Text in bold is nicknamesOther members Joining  If you are a member of BZPower, feel free to join us! We have a lot of fun together. (just in case this article didn't clue you in).Hideouts  BZPChat has a munber of hideouts, some of which are never visited. Mostly epic and/or deserted places where people never come. Some of them are as follows:Picture Galleries  Far too many pictures exist to place here, but to see the full galleries, visit the following:Boss Monster Hunting  For non-player character (NPC) Bosses click here. Many clans have Boss Monster Hunting as a regular event. This can be to try to get a good drop, to improve teamwork or just for fun. Usually, a group of 5-10 players will go to one of these events depending on the difficulty of the boss.King Black Dragon  Main article: King Black Dragon Hunting A very common monster hunted is the King Black Dragon. This is because it is quite easy to kill, and many kills can be made each trip. It is usually killed for profit, as it drops the draconic vsage, which is worth alot to a large clan. Most people melee the King Black Dragon, as the shield slot is taken by an anti-dragonfire shield, meaning no two-handed bows can be used. However, some rangers will use a rune crossbow, as it is one-handed. Magic is rarely used, due to it's ineffectiveness against dragons.Kalphite Queen  Main article: Kalphite Queen Hunting Another less commonly hunted monster is the Kalphite Queen. It is harder to kill than onther monsters because it has two forms. The first uses Protect from Missiles and Magic, and the second uses Protect from Melee. Because of this, players have to bring two sets of combat equipment, one for each form. Player who have the right level will bring Verac's. The advantage of Verac's is that it can hit through prayers, meaning no second combat equipment is needed.God Wars Dungeon  Main article: God Wars Dungeon A commonly visited area is the God Wars Dungeon. The monsters in this area are very high levelled, but the drops obtained from killing the monsters are worth a lot of money. As the monsters are almost impossible to solo, people often go in teams. A level of 60 Strength or Agility is needed to enter, as well as other levels required to get into other parts of the dungeon. The God Wars Dungeon is often only ever attempted by higher levelled clans.Elven Elite  The Elven Elite is an organized, fun, and friendly clan led by Nicolo77. It is small, but growing. Its members are helpful, friendly, and experienced Runescape players. We are always recruiting those who have 50+ combat, and are temporarily recruiting those who have 40+ combat. The only exception to this is our pures policy: If you have one skill that is at least 10 levels higher than all of your other stats, I consider you a pure. The one skill must be in the high scores and be at least 40. If you wish to sign up, post your name in the discussion page. I will then review your high score stats, and then add you to the members list if I feel that you will be a loyal member of the clan. The clan is mostly for members only, but we have a small free-player sub-clan. It is sponsored by us, and all members are allowed to attend free-player events while being in the members clan. The free-player sub-clan also has a requirement of having a combat level that is 50 or higher, unless you are an eligible pure. A member may participate in any event, while a free-player may only participate in free-player events and members events that are taking place on free-player worlds.Standard Clan News New  8-22 Pures Policy is Established To make this clan more open, I have created a pures policy to allow non-combat dedicated accounts to join. The policy is: If you have 1 skill that is at least 10 levels higher than all of you other stats, I consider you a pure. The 1 skill must be in the high scores and be at least 40. 8-21 Free-player Sub-clan Formed Recruitment is now open to free players to join the Elven Elite. This message effcts those you recruit, and also those who have applied and been declined because of their free-player status. 7-02 Emergency Draft: Clan Requirments Temporarily Lowered In an attempt to get this clan up and running, I have lowered the recruitment to 40+. This applies to both members and free players.

The clan was founded in March 2006 and focuses on the skills of Agility and Thieving. While these skills were paramount in the earlier parts of the clan's life, the clan, since the removal of Rogues' Den, has shifted more to a generalist community. We exist to provide our members an experience that will define their RuneScape experience \u2013 one that will provides our members with friends and a community that will even go beyond their time on RuneScape.\u00a0 Any level is permitted to join, so if you are interested please visit our clan chat in-game, Rogue Ninja Civ. The rest of this wiki page covers most of our clan history, as well as some of our pictures, videos, and fun facts.2006 The Beginning  The clan's origin starts after Shikimoko4, commonly referred to as Shiki, obtained his first set of Rogue Armor in March. After training many weeks for the quest Desert Treasure, which he would not go on to beat until a year later, he managed to satisfy the minimum requirements of 50 Agility and 50 Thieving for the Rogue Armor. The very night he got the armor, he decided to make a thread for a clan on the RuneScape Forums. His intent was to make a clan that would help serve others through protection and rescuing (mostly in the wilderness).The Original Members  First to join the Rogue Ninja Civilization (RNC), was Food Dealer7 (no longer playing), a friend of Shikimoko4. Food Dealer7 was also a former worker of Shikimoko4's previous organizations, Skywalker Industries and Dungeon Doctors. Following Food Dealer7 were multiple students that included Alchen (now playing as \"Sullied\"), Yugi385 (no longer playing), and Yon Kyu (no longer playing). This was Shikimoko4's original group, one that is commonly referred to as \"the Original Five\" (Shikimoko4 being included). With Shikimoko4's leadership, the group did rescue missions and planned to start a protection service.  It was also in this time that the clan's mascot, the Chaos Elemental, was coined its eternal name, Kibbles by Yugi385The Fall  Towards the end of May, life was getting complicated for the RNC's leader. After losing his membership, Shikimoko4 decided to quit without warning anyone. He left the RNC in the hands of Alchen, whom he considered to be his most promising student. Alchen and other students attempted to keep it running, but without the proper leadership skills or the devotion that Shiki had to the clan, the RNC quickly fell.2007 The Comeback  In late summer of 2006, Shikimoko4 appeared online one day and hinted that he may come back to the game. However, this didn't happen until December 31st, 2006. The former leader decided to get on for New Years, which he celebrated with members, Yon Kyu and Food Dealer7. The next day, January 1st, 2007, he made it offical that he would come back as soon as membership became avaliable to him; the RNC would make its return. Three months of planning went by until Shikimoko4 managed to get his membership. During that time, Yon Kyu became an important figure in the RNC's recreation. For his dedication and contributions, Shikimoko4 decided that when the RNC was restored, Yon Kyu would serve as its Co-Leader. The Rogue Ninja Civilization finally became restored on March 14th, 2007.The War  Although predominantly a peaceful clan, the Rogue Ninja Civilization ran into some problems with another ninja academy back in 2006 before Shikimoko4 left. The Ninja Academy Hidden in the Leaves was ran by Link Playa, who had started a fight with the RNC and was still active upon the RNC's remake. When the RNC returned, so did that conflict. Shikimoko4 was given ten days after he received membership to round up an army of at least 50 people before engaging in war with Link Playa's academy. Fortunately for the newly revived clan, the other academy backed out and disolved later. There were a few other wars involving less known ninja academies that the Rogue Ninja Civilization easily won, but like The Ninja Academy Hidden in the Leaves, they soon all dissolved and the Rogue Ninja Civilization remained as the longest living as well as the only ninja clan existing, which remains true to this day.New Students  The first student of the RNC's revival in 2007 was none other than Hunter Due 6 (currently known as CovertHunter Muffincake). CovertHunter has remained one of the clan's most loyal and faithful students through the RNC's journey. This year also brought some more memorable faces including Tyrandee (no longer playing), Escaflown01 (no longer playing), Aragorn93907 (currently known as Wolf Soul who is still very active), Kill9er5 (currently known as Killmander who is still very active), Dog Evil 321 (no longer playing), Pieman605 (no longer playing), 14321 (no longer playing), Scyther57 (very inactive), Stonegirl67 (no longer playing) Man of War87 (no longer playing), Tipaper (now known as Niiklause and is still very active), Rexboy200 (no longer playing), Basebalfan (no longer playing), Smilieboy34 (currently known as El Derpy, no longer playing due to a ban), Werewolf2 00 (no longer playing), and Takeshi370 (no longer playing).All of these students contributed something unique to the clan and they are remembered to this day.The Rise  2007 was the RNC's most treasured year yet. It got much success and fame, and had over 100 active members. Many people who are present to this day, joined during the 2007 time period. The range of activities expanded during 2007. King Black Dragon (Larry) trips and Chaos Elemental (Kibbles) hunts were done frequently. Plans for the Dagannoth Kings (Obama, Elvis, Rick Atsley) were also made. Stories regarding this time period written by Shikimoko4 himself can still be found at the clan's offsite forums on shivtr . More events were done, relations were good, and the year proved to be very successful.The Problems  It seems with every good there comes a bad. Towards the beginning of September, the RNC's activity began to decrease due to school returning for many of the members. People were getting on less often, dedication was decreasing, but the most significant blow to the RNC's state would be the loss of its co-leader Yon Kyu. Aside from being a close friend to the RNC's leader Shikimoko4, Yon Kyu served as an icon for the RNC. Many of the students were heavily attached to his presence and as he began to appear less and less, it hurt the RNC. By November of 2007, Yon Kyu had quit RuneScape. December was a very inactive month for the RNC. Everybody was confused as to what had happened to the clan. Only a few months ago, everything was perfect, where as now, there appeared to be nothing left. With only a few members, and one leader who was incredibly wounded by the loss of such a significant friend, the RNC was on its death bed.2008 A Story that Inspired  On January 1st, 2008, Shikimoko4, very hurt at the loss of his friend Yon Kyu and imminent doom of his clan, put his pen to paper as he began to write one of his most influential stories yet. The account summed up the RNC's history and good times that they had all shared. It also managed to bring back the RNC's co-leader for a brief time. For the first half of January, false hopes were presented. People came back, such as Yon Kyu and Yugi385; however, they didn't remain until the end of the month. By the end of January, the RNC was back to its inactive state of December.The Remainder of the Year  The RNC was considered inactive for most of 2008. By June of that year, Shikimoko4 decided to quit RuneScape. He left the clan in the hands of Hunter Due 6, Wolf Soul, and Tyrandee. Even after multiple attempts to recreate the clan, it continuously died. Many members left RuneScape or became incredibly inactive and their leader, Shikimoko4, was not to be seen again for a very long time. During these \"dark ages,\" various students joined, such as Dalek Cookie (very inactive), DarkDoomOrb (still very active), and AvatarFriday (no longer playing), but many of their names were soon forgotten because they either quit RuneScape or became very inactive. However, like Dalek Cookie, a few key students of this time are still active today.2009 The Reconnection  On January 1st, 2009, Shikimoko4 logged on RuneScape to see how it had changed. After spending much time with Takeshi370, Tyrandee, Wolf Soul, and Scyther57, he decided that he wanted to have contact with his former clan, but not necessarily bring the RNC back. This contact would not happen until four months later. Shikimoko4 got on RuneScape randomly every now and then. Most of the time his appearances would only be for a few minutes. In April of 2009, Shikimoko4 decided not to attempt to bring the RNC back, but to reconnect with his former students. He created a LiveJournal account ( http://shikimoko4.livejournal.com ) and a video that pleaded students to come into contact with him again. Despite having loose connections with his students, he managed to round up all those who remained. The sparse few remained in contact for the remainder of the year.  On July 18th of 2009, the clan made a transition to a community of LiveJournal, http://rogueninjacivilization.shivtr.com/ . Although the community has since been moved to shivtr, live journal paved the way for Shikimoko4 to connect with everyone. Shikimoko4 wanted to use it to keep a yearbook-like reminder of the RNC's doings and to continue to keep in contact with everyone. The clan still remained inactive, but they did begin to transition back to the home site of RuneScape. With the change in the system of RuneScape's Forums, which allowed free to play accounts to post comments and create threads, Shikimoko4 created a thread for the Rogue Ninja Civilization once again. The clan also began to pick up on some activity. The RNC had a Christmas event in which their former co-leader appeared, and the clan was able to see him after years of his absence. All of this new activity contributed to the decision that would later be made. During the month of December, the clan began to get on RuneScape more frequently. Shikimoko4 started coming online everyday as he did in 2007, communicating and socializing with his students. They did multiple Wilderness Survival type activities and the possibility of the RNC returning did not appear so far away as it did before. On December 31st, 2009, the question was finally asked to the RNC's former leader. \"Will you bring it back?\"2010 The Rebirth  January 1st again proved to be a changing moment for the RNC's history. After thinking the decision through thoroughly, Shikimoko4 decided he would remake the RNC on the conditions of: 1) That the RNC members would be more active on the RNC's home site. 2) Shikimoko4's sense of fashion would not be insulted. After the final decision was made, the remaining members of the RNC knew that a change was needed with its third recreation. After spending multiple nights planning and thinking of new ideas, Shikimoko4 suggested an elemental system be thrown in. Rogue Haven (no longer playing) elaborated on the idea, suggesting chakras. With a combined version of those suggestions and a few other additions, the clan's chakra system was born.  On January 4th, 2010, Shikimoko4 received membership. More plans and ideas were continuously added until the RNC's first meeting back on January 9th, 2010. The clan has been running and increasing in numbers since that time. The first exams were held on February 13th, 2010 where the first RNC Tscuchinin (earth ninjas) were inducted. The second were held on May 1st, 2010.  On February 14th, 2010, CovertHunter was inducted as the RNC's first Alpha. He received Shikimoko4's Dragon Dagger as a gift and show of trust. On February 20th, 2010, Nite Angel (no longer playing), Friarturky (no longer playing), AvatarFriday (no longer playing), and DarkDoomOrb (still very active) became the first Mizunin (water ninjas). On May 2nd, 2010, Nite AngeI and DarkDoomOrb become the first Kajinin (fire ninjas), The Blue G (still very active) reached the newly acquired rank shortly after. Soon after, on May 6th, 2010, Nite Angel and DarkDoomOrb ranked up to Kazenin (wind ninja), becoming the first Kazenin. The Blue G has also achieved this rank a few weeks later. On May 8th, 2010, the first RNC award ceremony was held (note, this was not the BDA). Many students received amulets to show the hard work they put in the RNC. The amulets would later be used to represent rank when the meeting attire had been changed. This ceremony also recognized Scyther57's promotion to Alpha.Mid Year  By the middle of 2010, the RNC had over 60 students. This was the most active the clan had been since 2007. With summer starting, the RNC planned to have their first open house party. They expected many new players to join. On August 3rd, Nite AngeI and DarkDoomOrb were finally promoted to Sensei after a long seven month journey. On September 7th, Waffleking3 and The Blue G upranked to Sensei as well.End of the Year  The RNC continued to shine with devoted sensei and students. One last sensei was inducted to the ranks as the year came to close: Starfire5557. The clan became very powerful as many new students joined the ranks; some which showed incredible admiration and devotion to the RNC. Notable students during this time are Put208, Ashandarei, Granite31, Fatal State and many more. The clan hosted many events which included a fantastic 3-part video, \"RNC Paranoia\" which was a huge success. There was also much revising, editing, and introductions to parts of the clan system. To top it off the clan, through many weeks of espionage and tactical set-up, with the efforts of major RNC figures such as Wolf Soul, DarkDoomOrb, Dalek Cookie, The Blue G, Shikimoko4 of course and Ashandarei (a student at the time) waged war on the Kingdom of Varrock. Thanks to the spies that had infiltrated the KOV, the RNC knew everything they need to know to hopefully take the Rogues' Castle from the hands of the Kingdom of Varrock. The war continued to bring the RNC closer then ever. The RNC being a clan that loves to joke around would often hang out in the Kovians' chat in order to find ways to crack jokes about the Kovians. The jokes were taken the wrong way though and the Kovians became very upset especially when the RNC released a certain video about their guards (lol). This initiated quite the stir among the RNC, as the Kovians threatened to use a mod's power to stop the RNC. The Rogue Ninja Civilization, always being a clan that loved to joke around, was disgusted with the way the Kovians handled the situation and made a promise that it would not be shaken by such a low ball move. The new year began and the R.N.C was a powerhouse waiting to test it's muscle.2011 Another Golden Year  At the beginning of the new year, many changes were made to the exams given to the students. These new exams incorperated the chakra system that had before been somewhat neglected. Behind the new masterpieces was Ashandarei who was only a Kazenin at the time. Another sensei, Killer19508 was inducted into the sensei ranks as well. To top it all off Wolf Soul, a veteran sensei of the R.N.C for almost five years as well as the creator of many new R.N.C. features, became the new Alpha giving the clan another leader to depend upon as Stoner Rogue and Scyther57 became less and less active. There were a few sad moments as the new year began as well. Veteran Sensei of three years, Dalek Cookie retired from the clan and remained in contact with only a few people. Although the loss of such a great sensei was hard on the clan, the RNC marched on and continued to strengthen itself. The war between the Rogue Ninja Civilization and the Kingdom of Varrock had also ceased due to a certain \"Romeo and Juliet\" incident (Shiki and Emu *cough*). In all seriousness though, the R.N.C and the K.O.V became close allies and started doing many group events together. From enemies to best of friends the two clans vowed to help one another and eliminate all tensions between each other. On February 26, 2011, the RNC had a ceremony honoring Wolf Soul's uprank to Alpha. Wolf Soul was also given his new unofficial nick name: \"Hotcakes\". On March 5, 2011, The RNC proudly recognized Ashandarei for having worked so hard creating new and improved exams, as well as submitting a myriad of other improvements to the clan's structure. Because of this and Ashandarei's great work giving missions to the students he became the second new Sensei of the year.New Updates  As the year continued many new updates to the clan's structure and looks were constructed. The RNC's theme colors changed from the original red, black, grey, and tan to blue-violet, black, grey, and tan. This new change reflected the RNC's mascot, Kibbles (the chaos elemental) with its blue-violet theme. Another major change was to the clan's home world of 44. After five years of having world 44 as the home world, the clan had to change to world 46 because world 44 was becoming over populated by Soul Wars players and very laggy. Alchen, one of the \"original five\" came back to RuneScape and started to become very devoted to the clan once again. It was quite a shock when he randomly came on to state that he was getting membership again but the clan is very joyed to have him back. Alchen automatically received the gold star rank (different from the alpha rank) on his return because of his being a part of the \"original five.\" During March the RNC learned that April was to be a clan themed player's art gallery. When Shiki heard the news he decided to draw a picture of the clan. This picture would immortalize the clan forever in its glory. It was to consist of all the Sensei in training, Sensei, Alphas, and Shiki. The picture was completed on March 30, 2011 and the whole clan was blown away by its magnificence. It truly was a day to celebrate as the clan's very image was soon shipped off to Jagex in hopes of entering the player's gallery. Then April 11th, 2011 Jagex released the winners and the RNC's Clan Drawing ('Rogue Ninja Civilization\" by Shikimoko4) made Jagex's 21st Player Art Gallery! Here is a link to the gallery: The winning clan picture. Needless to say there was much celebration that day. However, the greatest clan upgrade was yet to come...Clan Camp and More Changes  April 12th brought the new clan camp to RuneScape and with it many changes to the RNC. One big change was the ranking system. The introduction of the bronze and silver keys as well as the no longer existing smiley rank actually helped the clan a lot in its ranking structure. Alpha's became silver keys, Sensei bronze keys, Sensei in Training gold stars, following this trend all the way to initiate's which became the \"one chevron\" rank. This new ranking system made it so that the Kazenin and Sensei in Training were given their own individual ranks so that they wouldn't be confused with one another. Clan vexillums also made it easy to introduce new members to the clan's forum thread and get them signed up. Because of this and the clan's new found popularity being in the players gallery, the RNC started recruiting a massive amount of members. In only a few days over 80 members were in the clan and this didn't even include half of the clan members who hadn't yet been invited to the new clan chat. On top of this many old RNC legends were returning. One of the returning legends was Dalek Cookie who after much thought decided it would be best to re-join the RNC. With the clan's numbers and levels (the clan now boasts very high combat levels) steadily rising the future looked promising. The month of April was a busy month for the RNC, but a celebratory one as the clan welcomed its newest sensei, Put208, into its ranks early that month.Summer Fun  The RNC started off the summer with a bang! \u00b8\u2022**\u2022\u00b8 \u00b8\u2039\u2022*\u00b0\u02c6\u00b0*\u2022\u203a\u00b8\n\u02c6\u203a\u201e\u00b8\u00b8\u00b8;\u201e\u2039\u02c6\u00dfL\u00c1\u00c7K \u00d0\u00c1GG\u20acR \u00c1W\u00c1R\u00d0\u00a7 On June 11th at 5:00 PM eastern time, the first annual Black Dagger Awards were held in Shiki's Throne Room. Sparkdog5 (now Love Spark, and male\u00a0:P), the creator of the awards show, had been working on it since March and much practice and anticipation followed.The event was a huge hit and a very large portion of the clan showed up. There were many nominees but in the end only thirty-two awards were given out to very deserving winners. Bs Sports a very dedicated and generous member of the RNC, donated 500k per award to the winners, in total donating over 16m! The event will go down in history as a truly spetacular production through its formal dresscode, amazing participation, and the love the clan felt throughout the ceremony. The official photographer of that evening was DarkDoomOrb, as seen in the upper left-hand corner of most screenshots. Pictures of the ceremony as well as a list of the winners of the Black Dagger categories follow. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 As the summer continued Ragmore4 became the RNC's newest Sensei. Ragmore4 had worked very hard even after becoming a Sensei in Training and has now become a very good example for the new Sensei to follow. CovertHunter at this time also introduced a new Roleplaying thread to the RNC which can be found on the forums. If you are in the RNC and are interested in participating then here is the quick-find-code: 46-47-432-62883897.  On July 5, 2011 the RNC finally reached 200 members. This number was significant because this was the first time in RNC history that the clan had more members than before 2007. It was a momentus occation and a symbol of how far the clan had come. Shikimoko4 also decided to put on a Rogue Ninja Civilization history session which told the story of the great legacy of the RNC, how it was started, and everything it went through to get to where it is now. It was a great success and many of the newer members really appreciated knowing the clan's history. On July 12, thanks to \"The Excel\" (a helpful member of the Runescape Clan Wiki community), the RNC moved from Hyperboards which while a great site had some faults for a clan forum, to a great new clan site Shivtr which promised to be everything the clan needed and more.The Clan Citadel  In 2011, Jagex finally started to cater to the clans that were abundant in RuneScape, and on July 26, 2011, Jagex released their largest clan update in years -Clan Citadels. A personal flying citadel was made available for any pay-to-play clan with at least 5 active members to perform the opening spell. Needless to say, the whole RNC gathered in the Clan Camp ready to see their new home, which would be about the size of a city. Veteran Senseis Dalek Cookie, Wafferz Pwnz, Killer19508, AnonymousP, and leader Shikimoko4 were the ones chosen (having been the only ones awake at the time) to perform the 5 person ritual to open the portal to a new future for the RNC. Once the portal was open, the clan piled in to explore their new floating base. Within the first couple of hours, the clan had 100 members visit and had over 50,000 timber in resources. This was an amazing show of dedicationion by students and leaders alike because the highest tier possible, Tier 7, requires 50 members doing about 20 minutes of work a week. The RNC had left the requirement in the dust within minutes. With the clan working in full force, the RNC pushed forward to a maxed citadel -the symbol of a truly dedicated and organized clan. With this new challenge, the RNC was out to prove that they were the best.New Ranks  With the release of Clan Citadels there new ranks were released for clans to use. This update was taken as an opportunity to award a new rank to two of the Sensei, Ashandarei and DarkDoomOrb. This new rank, Beta, a step below Alpha, symbolized their managerial contributions to the clan as both are very active in the leading and managing of the clan's sites and resources. Doom, being in charge of the forums, and Ash, being in charge of the exams also had many other contributions between them. This new rank was awarded to any Sensei who, while not at the level of an Alpha, still makes major contributions to running the clan. As for the other two ranks, there were no other overlaps in rank at the time, so they had been put aside for possible use later. A few weeks after, Ragmore4 was promoted to Beta with Dalek Cookie as they both took on a more active role in the clan's management.Autumn Beginnings and Ends  As the clan pushed forward with the goal of a maxed citadel, it had slowly become reality that the clan had come up with a way to give points to students for capping. The original proposal was to have students post screenies of themselves on the off-site forums showing they've capped. This idea made for an unprecedented amount of usage on the off-site, as a majority of the clan members signed on and created profiles. As with every year, autumn also brought school to a large majority of the RNC. Although activity did decrease slightly, the RNC was still very active and things looked good. Unfortunately, there were a few sad moments. Ashandarei would not be able to play RuneScape for a whole year due to real-life obligations, and Dalek Cookie (a Beta at the time) and Jay7777777 (Sensei-in-Training), two very influential members of the clan, decided to quit RuneScape because of botting, the new Refer-a-Friend update, and various other reasons. Wolf Soul, a very active editor of the Clan's wiki page, became pretty busy with college, so he handed most of his responsibilities to Ashandarei who would be able to edit much more frequently, despite not being able to play RuneScape. Wars, missions, and crazy parties still showered the clan, and autumn was not as much of a downer as some had thought it might be. More excitement escalated as three new Sensei were chosen! This was the largest batch of Sensei every to be let through at the time! Great congratulations were given to the three new Sensei: Hamtaro (Nindjahamsta), Spark (Love Spark), and Xeo (Xeorth). The year ended on a sadder note. With threats of the Rogues' Den being removed, the clan pleaded with moderators in hopes that this update would be an addition, rather than a removal of the Rogues' Den the RNC had been born from. However, the den could not be saved, and on December 13th, 2012, Jagex released the Flash Powder Factory in its place. With this, the RNC unveiled a new system to fit in with the much higher requirements of the factory.2012 Early 2012  The RNC started the year 2012 with a bit of a rocky start- Shikimoko4 was dealing with personal problems and wasn't able to be on as much as he wanted. The clan pulled through though, and with the help of Ara (Wolf Soul), Ashandarei, Ragmore4, BioMasterZap, and Shikimoko4, the new system, Elemental Pathways, was designed and implemented as a replacement for the previously outdated system. Despite the loss of one of the most important aspects of the clan and a now outdated system, the RNC managed to close the year with plenty of fun - including a huge Christmas party that involved gifts, quizzes, and a surprise trip to Kibbles and a New Years Eve event in which the clan stalked a Jagex moderator and partied in the Citadel. BS Sports upranked to the rank of sensei. Davetebrave became the RNC's official event manager and has helped to plan wars and boss trips on the weekend to preserve the clan's activity. Kicking the year off with a start, the RNC has already participated in over six wars and multiple boss trips by mid-February. The clan hopes to continue its progress and start its next film production, Paranoia 2.Elemental Pathways  Now once a student finishes his rank of Initiate, he may choose an elemental pathway of Fire, Wind, Earth, or Water, in which the attributes and traits of each element will be those that are tested in that student's exam. This trait of the new system is a drastic contrast to that of the old, in which each student experienced a small portion of each element as he went from rank to rank.Jobs and Clubs  In March 2012, a new way to get more involved in the clan arose. Jobs were aimed as a way for students who wanted to go above and beyond and aid in clan affairs. However, members of any rank may apply for a Job. As of launch, avaliable positions included: Level One Exam Manager, Level Two Exam Manager, Level Three Exam Manager, and List Manager. According to Shiki, the exam managers \"will be responsible for examining the Points List and noting who satisfies their point requirement (above the -- line in the list). The manager will then get in contact with those people who need an exam on a weekly basis - an in-game message (if the student is online) AND an offsite private message (if the student has an offsite account) letting them know they need to take their exam to uprank. The manager will then message me each Saturday via offsite private message letting me know who all he contacted\" The List Manager \"is responsible for doing a weekly check on the list (we'll choose a day that fits your schedule). The manager has to note if someone is no longer in the clan chat or if someone changed their username. He will then send me a weekly private message via offsite letting me know the changes so I may update them.\" Clubs were another way for students to get more involved with the clan. Each club would have an appointed Manager and Co-Manager. Like any other club, they can recruit fellow clanmates to join and take part in their activities. Each club would be required to have a weekly meeting and give a report to Shiki. The first two clubs were the RNC Recruit Club and the Ideas Club (though it ironically could never agree on a name itself). According the Shiki, the \"RNC Recruit Club will be involved in the RNC's recruitment affairs. Once a week, this club will do recruitment activities for at least 1-2 hours, involving both in-game and the RS Forums. If you're looking to be involved without being a manager, you can simply join the club as a member. The manager of this club is responsible for alerting members of the club when the event is/what it is, hosting it, and sending me a private message once a week about the clubs activities and who all showed.\" The Ideas Club \"will be involved in proposing new ideas for the RNC. Like the RNC Recruit Club, this club will have a weekly event that involves discussing and proposing ideas to be sent before the clan. The manager of this club is responsible for alerting members of the club when the event is/what it is, hosting it, and sending me a private message once a week about the clubs activities and who all showed.\" However, with the absense of the Ideas Club's leader, Bio, the club collapsed. Other later clubs included the Fight Club and Paparazzi Club.A New Chapter of Sensei  A plan conceived as early as March and starting on May 20th, 2012, a re-evaluation period occurred for all Sensei. During this time, all active Sensei had been de-ranked to Sensei-in-Training. All inactive Sensei had moved to an Honorary Sensei rank. When they have shown activity again, however, they may re-earn their rank, as well. Before this, the Beta rank had be removed as it was rendered obsolete by the new standards of Sensei.The Next Big Summer  For the summer of 2012, it was time to party. New events were planned, and the filming of Paranoia 2 would begin once more. \u00b8\u2022**\u2022\u00b8 \u00b8\u2039\u2022*\u00b0\u02c6\u00b0*\u2022\u203a\u00b8\n\u02c6\u203a\u201e\u00b8\u00b8\u00b8;\u201e\u2039\u02c6\u00dfL\u00c1\u00c7K \u00d0\u00c1GG\u20acR \u00c1W\u00c1R\u00d0\u00a7 2 On June 8th at 9:00 PM eastern time, the second annual Black Dagger Awards were held. Love Spark, the creator of the awards show, had been working on it for a long time and much practice and anticipation followed. The event was a huge hit and a very large portion of the clan showed up. There were many nominees but in the end only thirty-two awards were given out to very deserving winners. The total cost of reward money was 3.2m this year. A list of the winners of the Black Dagger categories follows. [needs images] Starting the weekend of June 16th, 2012, it was time to restore the RNC's Wiki pages. A movement led by Doom, the Wikis were updated with the lastest information, compiling news from the time periods of January to June of 2012. In addition, the Rank and Mission Lists also received much-needed updates to contain the new reworks. DaveandShiki became RNC's newest Sensei. He has worked hard as a SIT, and continues to do so as a Sensei.Elemental Kassen  In mid July the RNC hosted it's first Elemental Kassen. It was a competition between each of the four elements. The competitions included a tournament at the Duel Arena, an Agility Race, a Theiving Race, a Scavenger Hunt, and a Clan Wars Battle. After a fierce competition, the Element of Fire won. The Wind Element came in second place, followed by Water and Earth for third. Interestingly enough, Water had never scored below 2nd place in any event.Summer's End  After the Elemental Kassen, the Sensei began planning RNC's first 24 hour mission. It occured on Friday August 31st 6p.m. EST, and went right through Saturday September 1st 6p.m. EST. Leading up to this was a Weeklong Minigame Event, put together by Pinwit and DarkDoomOrb. The event included Burthorpe Games Room, Barbarian Assault, Clan Wars, Stealing Creation, Pest Control, Castle Wars, and the Citadel Battlefield. Some of which, the RNC hadn't done in months.Paranoia 2  A sequel to the popular RNC Paranoia, a video created in late 2010, this video features even more madness and mayhem for the entire clan to enjoy. The project was announced in January of 2012, and ideas became flooding in in massive number. Later on down the road, filming began. As of August 2012, filming still continues.Fall 2012  Fall usually marks the start of school for most of the RNC. Even though activity did decrease slightly the RNC still hosted many great missions. New types of missions were created. Shiki designed and opened jobs to the RNC. These jobs were created in order to help Shiki and let clan mates be more involved in the clan. RNC members could apply for jobs freely. The jobs that clan members could apply for were: Upranking Management Forums Management Events Management Citadel Management Sensei Management At the beginning of October Dyzt, the leader of the Recruitment Club, has stepped down, as the took over the Citadel Managment. Pinwit took his place as the leader of the club, and Red zam mage became the club co-leader.  As Always RNC had its Halloween event. This Halloween event was on Friday October 26th in the citadel due to the bonus xp Weekend. The Halloween event included a costume contest, trick-or-treating and a break dance contest on the second floor of the citadel. This event was organized by DarkDoomOrb and Pinwit. The winners for the Halloween custom contest were:Senpai - The New Rank  At the beginning of October, Shikimoko4 began planning a new rank along with the other senseis. This rank would serve as an alternate path to senseiship, as the Sensei Trials were taking too long. This new rank is between SIT and Sensei and is a Organizer rank in the clan chat. This rank has almost all the abilities that the sensei rank does, and allows the use of the clan avatar. In order to become a Senpai, one must be a SIT for atleast 3 months and apply for this rank. Beastin Fury, Dyzt, Lostdream, and Pinwit were the first SIT to become Senpai.Tier 7 Citadel  On October 30th at 9:20pm est, the RNC finally got their Tier 7 Citadel after sixteen weeks of work. This was truly an amazing accomplishment. Ironically enough, the Grand Door project had to be postponed during this sixteen-week process, and continued to be put off as the RNC upgraded this skill plots to Tier 7. On the 30th of October, the RNC received 30 visits to the citadel in less then 12 hours -a feat never to have been done before. For the first few hours following the RNC's uprank, they partied.DOA Cycle  Shiki launched a new activity promotion for SIT+. DOA is short for Days of Action.\u00a0He deemed that it would be nice to have atleast one daily event. This DOA cycle affects SIT+. Every weekend Shiki selects 5 SIT+ that will host an event scheduled for a given day Monday through Friday. The SIT+ may ask to reeschedule if there is a problem, but if he fails to complete his mission within that day/week that the SIT+ was assigned he/she is given one more opprotunity to complete it by the end of the cycle. If the SIT+ fails to complete his DOA, then he/she shall be demoted to honorary Sensei.Year's End  The year was coming close to an end, RNC still had some fun, with more events, crazy parties, and crazy missions. The RNC started upgrading their plots to Tier 7 one by one. RNC hosted it annual Thanksgiving event, which over 20 members attended. A kick was done to remove inactive members from the clan chat, so the RNC could stay up to date, with its members's list.  As December came the end of the year was approaching. Ghost Team2 and Pinwit started a movement in\u00a0mid November to have special RNC missions for the rest of year including: KFC vs McDonalds, RNC's Thanksgiving, How to Survivie a Bear Attack, Zombie Survival, Attack of the Pirates, and RNC'S Christmas. On December 22nd the RNC celebrated its anual Christmas event, which over 20 members attended. The RNC had a gift exchange and then went over to Kibbles and gave him milk and cookies (cake) like\u00a0they did last year.2013 The Beginning and Change  The RNC, like every year, started off with a party. In the first week days of the new year, a lot of change was happening to the RNC. The clan's first DOA cycle ended, with those SIT+ that did not complete theirs, were demoted to Honorary Sensei. As the DOA cycle ended the current Senpai went through some evaluations. These evaluations consisted of current progress of the Senpai in the clan. The Senpai either received a promotion or a report of what he has done well and what needs improvement. Dyzt was the only Senpai selected from the first DOA cycle to become a Sensei and there was a huge Coronation Ceremony for his promotion. The next DOA cycle began right after the first one ended. Shiki launched a new activity definition. It affects students. In order to remain in the clan a student needs to earn at least one point in a four week period, whether that be through a forum booster, or a mission, or voting in the offsite poll. If the student does not earn a point, then the student shall be deemed inactive and shall be kicked from the clan.Spring and the RNC Revival  After the end of the next DOA cycle, Ashandarei, a previous Sensei of the RNC, was re-promoted to the rank of Sensei for the outstanding work he has put into the clan since coming back from a leave of absence. The RNC soon killed off its 6th thread at the beginning of April and the 7th thread was made. Shiki did not get the first post and neither did he get second and third post for the first time. The first three posts were taken by Doom, Pinwit, and Hunter. On the Weekend of April 12th, the RNC started its recruitment drive, which was meant to mass recruit people into the clan, to see some new faces. On April 12th at 8 p.m. the RNC celebrated its 7th birthday! It was a huge success as many students as well as Sensei went with Shiki along with the Alphas to Rogue's Castle. There Shiki and Ara gave amazing speeches in regards to the birthday of the clan and all its successes. In the beginning of May Pinwit released RNC's first newspaper called Rogue Monthly.\u00a0The origional staff included Dyzt, Toxicsmurf18, Lostdream, ZarosLord,\u00a0Shikimoko4, and Pinwit. The newspaper included articles about recent\u00a0changes in the clan, citadel news, Shiki's opinions, a joke section,\u00a0a sports section, and a story section.\u00a0As May progressed, three senpai were promopted for their tireless work they have done to the clan to the rank of Sensei; they where: EpicChaoz, Lostdream, and Pinwit. As more RNC members ended school in June, the amount of activity in the clan increased and by the end of June the RNC was seeing one or more missions being hosted daily. The RNC payed its respects to those who where pked during the Falador Massacre on June 6, an event lead by Zaroslord.Elemental Management  On June 6th, 2013, Shiki released news about new elected positions. The positions included:\u00a0 On June 16th, 2013, voting soon began. Here are the election contenders and what they were running for: Voting soon concluded on the 18th of June: The Chakra SystemAbout  According to Hinduism, there are many chakra centers throughout our bodies. Each of these main energy centers is referred to as a chakra, a Sanskrit word meaning wheel. A chakra is a vortex that will draw in anything on it's particular vibratory level. Now, there are hundreds of those energy centers, but the main four are present down the spinal column. Each of which is connected on a different level: physically, emotionally, mentally, and spiritually. Having an understanding of how each of those chakras affects one's personally, is how one reaches true understanding. Each chakra governs a wide range of topics - organs, elements, emotions, traits, etc. We decided to take parts of this system and incorporate it into our system of how one undergoes the process of becoming a ninja, just like one undergoes the process of understanding his chakras. In both processes, one learns about oneself. One undergoes a change to better oneself and work towards nirvana, the perfect peace and understanding of oneself.Root Chakra  Muladhara or root chakra is related to instinct, security, survival and also to basic human potentiality. Key issue involves obsession. Physically, Muladhara governs stability, emotionally it governs sensuality, and spiritually it governs a sense of security.*** This first step is the Tsuchinin rank.Sacral Chakra  The key issues involving Svadisthana are relationships, violence, addictions, basic emotional needs, and pleasure. Physically, Svadisthana governs reproduction, mentally it governs creativity, emotionally it governs joy, and spiritually it governs enthusiasm.*** This second step is the Mizunin rank.Solar Plexus Chakra  Manipura or manipuraka is related to the metabolic and digestive systems. Key issues governed by Manipura are issues of personal power, fear, anxiety, opinion-formation, introversion, and transition from simple or base emotions to complex. Physically, Manipura governs digestion, mentally it governs personal power, emotionally it governs expansiveness, and spiritually, all matters of growth.*** This third step is the Kajinin rank.Heart Chakra  Anahata, or Anahata-puri, or padma-sundara is related to the thymus, located in the chest. Anahata is symbolised by a lotus flower with twelve petals. Key issues involving Anahata involve complex emotions, compassion, tenderness, unconditional love, equilibrium, rejection and well-being. Physically Anahata governs circulation, emotionally it governs unconditional love for the self and others, mentally it governs passion, and spiritually it governs devotion.*** This fourth step is the Kazenin rank.Ranks Initiate  Clan Chat Rank- Recruit This is where you are before you start you journey as a ninja.

It relates to the element of Earth, or Tsuchi. Earth is an element that heavily relates to security, so it is no surprise that this chakra governs security and stablity. This chakra will bring out your potential. To uprank from Tsuchinin, you'd undergo a test that proved your courage and faith in yourself and in others. Trust is the foundation of any group. The exam tested your ability to survive in harsh conditions, which is necessary in any ninja. Requirements - Agility Level - 30 \u2022 Thieving Level - 30 \u2022 Points - 50 Meeting Attire - Gold Amulet/Clan Cape + Ninja ArmorMizunin  Clan Chat Rank- Sergeant - Svadhisthana: The Sacral Chakra - This was the second step in your journey. The sacral chakra relates to the element of Water, or Mizu. Water deals with one's creativity, self-expression, and emotion. All of those topics are governed by the the sacral chakra. Ninja need to have wit and clear-thinking when presented with certain situations. This would test your ability to be creative and work your way out of dangerous situations to allow yourself and others to survive. To uprank from Mizunin, you'd undergo a test that would prove that you have the wit and thinking of a true ninja. It'd test your ability to think and design.

It's element is Fire, or Kaji. This chakra governs the idea of self power and energy. This chakra would test your strength on both the physical and mental level. To uprank from Kajinin, you'd undergo a test that would prove that you have the strength of a ninja in various fields. Requirements - Agility Level - 40 \u2022 Thieving Level - 40 \u2022 Points - 300 \u2022 Have passed the Mizunin Exam.

The element that is governed by this chakra is Wind, or Kaze. Wind is also known to have the trait of compassion and understanding. In order to master this chakra, you'd be tested on your devotion to the RNC, along with the other requirements.

Check it out.Mission System About  Missions serve as the main way students aquire points that are used to uprank. It also gives the opportunity for our sensei to bond with the students. In order for a mission to count for points, a minimum of one sensei and one to two students must be present. Missions are done in time intervals of 30 minutes. For example, if a mission is only done for 15 minutes, half the points are rewarded, where as if a mission is done within an hour, points are doubled. If a mission is done within 30 minutes, normal points are rewarded.Mission List C-Rank Missions  Our miscellaneous missionsB-Rank Missions  Our roguish missionsA-Rank Missions  Our RNC missionsS-Rank Missions  Our most important eventsEvents  Check our thread on the RuneScape forums or our site for Current Events, Meetings, Polls, Competitions, and more!

Screenie Sources: All Images Dark's ScreeniesSensei Facts  A list of every Sensei that has ever been in the RNC, in order of when they were given Senseiship:Videos Fun Facts Free-to-Play  Free-to-Play, also known as F2P, is the free version of RuneScape where no annual/monthly payment is needed. Players who play the free version are known as \"free players\", \"F2Ps\", or \"non-members\". This is in contrast to members, who pay a monthly fee for access to a much larger map and a multitude of skills, items, quests and activities, and a more advanced version of the Instant Demo, a version of the game with very little features. Reasons to remain F2P are that it is free, it is less dangerous, and there is a lesser chance of death. Disadvantages are that it is simpler, there are only 68 bank slots, 78 bank spaces after email conformation, there are fewer quests, and less powerful armour and enemies. There are also less skills, certain skills are limited in what they can do, and there are advertisements on free-to-play worlds. Members can post on the official RuneScape Forums, and have several other privileges within the website. Due to changes, free players can access the forum too (must have over 2.5 million total experience or a total level of 350).Clans  Free-to-Play has many more clans than pay-to-play, because of the large amount of free-to-play players. Most RSB clans do not currently allow F2P players to join, though with non-members being granted access to the Forums, this may change. There are some RSB clans that accept non-members. RSC clans are more likely to accept non-members.Activities  At the moment, there are only 5 F2P Activities. This means that it can be hard to hold events for a F2P clan. Many F2P clans will take part in activities such as the Duel Arena, Clan Wars and PKing. Because F2P players cannot access many members areas or minigames, lots of P2P clans do not allow F2P players to join.Warring  F2P warring is known as quality warring in most of the RSC and parts of the RSB. Because of the low price of F2P materials, it is pretty easy to get F2P supplies. Thus, most of the people in a clan war, in F2P, have the same equipment. With this, it is also notable that levels of people in clans are closer together, as many higher level players enjoy P2P more than F2P. Thus, F2P warring is known as a strategic war zone. All major RSC and RSB ladders contain F2P warring and three of them contain 10+ clans. On the RSC, F2P warring is the quality of the community. Almost all wars are F2P and thus, F2P is the largest warring division in RAW (RSC's Largest Warring Ladder).Limitations  F2P players are limited on skills, and updates. Holiday events have a timed schedule for the F2P community, P2P players could finish a holiday event with more time than the F2P players, P2P members have the full-screen option, P2P players have many more options than the F2P. The summoning, hunting, slayer, herblore, construction, farming and fletching skills have been made for the P2P community.See Also  Category:Free-to-Play Clans \nPay-to-PlayArmy of RuneScape Ranks  These are the officer ranks of the Army of RuneScape, which all directly resemble the U.S. Army's hierarchy.Uniform  The only things you are allowed to wear is Camo Gear from the Drill Demon random event, an amulet, a ring, a cape, gloves, and leather boots.Knights of the Abyss  Knights of the Abyss (KOTA) is a 80+ combat clan, that was founded on 6th August 2007 by Soldier 1033. Originally titled 'Saradomin's Army', Knights of the Abyss has been providing fun and activity to it's members for over three years! If you would like to check out this clan, please stop by KOTA's clan chat, Knights_Of_The_Abyss.Leadership  The clan's leadership is divided into a High Council and a Low Council. The High Council votes to make all important decisions concerning the entire clan. It takes a 3/5 majority to pass a vote for the High Council. The Lower Council serves to advise the High Council, and can pass votes as well. It takes a 4/7 majority to pass a vote for the Lower Council. Once a decision passes in the Lower Council it is passed up to the High Council. They may either reject it or pass it with a 3/5 majoirity. At current, these positions are:High Council  High Council Members are Deputy Owners in the Clan Chat. KOTA-iKon is the owner of the Clan Chat.Low Council  Lower Council Members are Overseers in the Clan Chat.Events  Knights of the Abyss do many  clan events, ranging from Castle Wars to God Wars Dungeon. Possible events could include Castle Wars, Clan Wars,  Fight Pits, Boss Monster Hunting, or event snowball fights! It's up to the imagination of the Event Co-Ordinators.Event Co-Ordinators  There is a small team of Event Co-Ordinators who have the job of running and recording official clan events. The current Event Co-Ordinators are:Popular Events  The most popular clan events are:Attendance Points  Whenever a clan member attends an event, they will receive 1 event attendance point. Event attendance points are used to gain ranks in the Clan Chat. Each and every event is record by an event leader in a forum on the clan site and personally counted by the Head of High Council. The points required for each rank are: If a member already has a rank due to a position in the clan (for example, if they are a Council member or Events Co-Ordinator), they will have the relevant rank. If their points will let them have a higher rank than their position, they will have that rank.History The Founding of the Clan  On August 6, 2007, the day that Jagex released the Clan Chat feature, Soldier 1033, along with a friend (Pbcamper150) decided to make a clan. Soldier 1033 stood at the Rimmington house portal for quite awhile gaining new members, and Pbcamper searched the Forums and recruited a very loyal clan member as well. The clan was known as Saradomin's Army. The first member to join was another friend of Soldier's and Pb's, M2r2p2. Other original members included Owlboy1, Jys072595, and Cwgrant. A few days later while at a Castle Wars event, several other members (Reven276, Jetblast11, and Hunsterssoul) joined SA. Big Mike265 also joined the clan around that time.High Council  In the beginning, the clan was solely lead by Soldier 1033. Over time, he felt that it was best to bring others up to help make important decision in the clan, so he formed the High Council. Reven276, and Big Mike265 were the first two members to be added to this council. Over time, the council was expanded to four and then five members, to divide clan power. A 3/5 vote was able to pass any actions in the clan, overriding even the Lower Council's votes. This has since changed and the Lower council cannot be overruled if all its members agree. A council advisor spot was once added to the high and lower councils. Sometime later, it was removed because of inactivity of the positions and it was deemed no longer necessary at the time. Originally, the Head of High Council (Soldier 1033), retained some extra powers over all High Council members, giving him a slight advantage in council votes. However, any extra powers that the Head of High council did have are now removed, the position now acts as a personal overseer of the clan and council.High Council members, past to present:  Head of High Council -> Soldier 1033 -> Stargate 277 -> (position terminated) High Council Member -> Reven276 -> Stargate 277 -> Theboy1001 -> KOTA-Hammer -> Stargate 277 High Council Member -> Big Mike265 -> Roow20 -> Cwgrant High Council Member -> Doglover1355 -> Foxes20 -> Iceman3317 -> KOTA-Dragoon -> Solis High Council Member-> Thisisblake2 -> 20525 -> Lifeless384 -> Reven276 -> Soldier 1033 -> iKonnor High Council Advisor -> Vauderus- > (Advisor spot removed)Lower Council  After the formation of the High council, they decided to create a Lower council to help them in clan decisions. The Lower council's duties were, and still are to assist the High council in making decisions, voting on decisions, assist in organizing events, and to help ensure that the clan is running smoothly. At first, the lower council's power was not close to that of the High council, this has since leveled out. When it was first formed the lower council consisted of five members, four normal members and one Head of Lower Council. The LC changed over time, and was eventually expanded to seven members. Like the High council a council advisor was added to the Lower council. Unfortunately, it was later removed by the councils along with the other advisor spot. The changes in the positions were not recorded for the Lower council.Clan Name Changes  Sometime in late November or early December 2007, the Saradomin's Army HC decided that a change in the name of the clan was necessary to improve recruitment. Since up to this point it was a Saradomin clan, which generally only attracted people who liked Saradomin. The HC decided to go with a new clan name that had nothing to do with any RS gods. They thought about it and eventually chose the name Guild of Glory. Several days later Soldier learned that most of the clan did not approve of this name, so the HC once again set to work thinking of another name. Doglover1355 suggested 'Knights of the Abyss', and it stuck. The name was passed, and from then on the clan was known as, and still is known as, Knights of the Abyss.Clan Requirement Changes  When Saradomin's Army was born on August 6, 2007, it was a 40+ clan. It stayed like that for awhile, until sometime in September or October when the clan decided they wanted to become stronger. SA became 80+, so when the name changed to Guild of Glory and then Knights of the Abyss, the clan was still 80+. Shortly after the release of the Summoning skill, (when Soldier 1033 got his combat to 90) KOTA went 90+. On June 10th, 2009 KOTA was lowered it's requirements to 70+ to gain newer more active members, and to give lower levels a chance to join KOTA. Later on September 13th, 2009 KOTA became 80+ again to begin regaining it's old requirements.Wars  The clan has fought in other wars, but these are the only official wars. Following these KOTA withdrew from a warring status.Clan Forums  Knights of the Abyss have their own Forums. These were created by Soldier 1033 and is where most of the important clan information will be found. There are also Boards on the site for general chat/discussion. To view the entire Forums, a player must be a member of Knights of the Abyss. The Forums are usually quite active, and have 264 registered members; however, few of these members post regularly. Current forum posts: 23,204Joining KOTA  To join KOTA, visit one of two links below: If you have any questions, please leave a message on the clan talk page or leave a message on Stargate 277's talk page.Other Links RSB Ladder Rankings  The RSB Ladder Rankings are the original and most popular form of war rankings on the RSB. The point of the Ladder is to declare war on other clans to earn warring ranks.History  The RSB Ladder Rankings were founded sometime in 2006 or 2007. However, the exact date is unknown, as the archives only go as far back as January 2007.The Ladder  The Ladder Rankings have certain rules that all clans are required to follow, as well as guidelines that explain how the ranking system works. The following is quoted directly from the RSB Ladder Rankings thread: RSB Ranking System ~ The format will be simple, there will be two Leagues with one division each (two if more Clans join) to the rankings, and will include - Division 1 P2P Division I F2P The standards & rules for all divisions will be the same. Rankings are public and open to anyone within the community as long as they are followed. Those who do not want to be ranked or mentioned for whatever reason(s) will be respected. I do not care nor have time for side issues and personal rhetoric questions. As such, ONLY clans that agree to the standards and rules will be ranked. This thread is here to bring some structure to clan interaction as well as create a viable platform for clans to compete, again only THOSE clans that CHOOSE to compete will be ranked. This system is based PURELY on direct clan combat around a ladder style tournament base and does not factor ANY opinions or personal views on other clans and/or rankings in the community. As this is a community thread personal agenda, politics and flaming are NOT allowed and will be reported as such. This list is not the sole 'property' of anyone, it is for the community and will pass between capable members as needed. The following is but some of the people, who have helped in making this system possible, be it in the present or past. A special thanks to Lady Foul for starting this ladder league and setting the standard for fair play in wars. Credits: The following have established, upholded, and improved the ladder through thick and thin. For that we thank them.

After months and months of debates a Council was formed to create new rules and to stay on and assist the Ladder community. These are your current 5 council members: A Man Eater Matt0708 Saragirl555 Spellman26 Wo0tstation -The council is here to propose new rules and fix old ones. -The council can only make decisions based on a majority vote. -To kick a clan from the ladder the council needs a clear majority vote.   ~Thread Rules~ This is a thread for posting declarations, results, updates and applications so please no flaming. Any clan that starts or continues to flame will be punished according to the 3 strike rule.(See 3 Strike Rule for details.) The threadholder is to act in an appropriate manner while running the ladder. They are to be fair to ALL clans and individuals. Any holder that does not uphold the maturity to hold the ladder will be subject to punishment according to the 3 strike rule.(See 3 Strike Rule for details.) ~Warring Rules~ \u2022All wars are full out. This cannot be changed under ANY circumstances. This means no matched opt wars and no mini wars. Free-for-all battles are NOT permitted; wars are fought in the traditional (purple) portal. \u2022Wars are to be fought in 'knockout' format run ins are NOT permitted as this contradicts the traits of the term 'Full out' stated previously in the rules. The \u2018Kill \u2018em all\u2019 option should be used to re-enforce this <--- THOUGHTS ON THIS POINT \u2022Both clans must agree to the terms of the war. If they cannot agree then the council must step in and set new reasonable terms. \u2022Summoning will be allowed in P2P Wars. It will only \"not\" be allowed if both clans negotiated and agreed on the matter. If arguments still occur, the threadholder or council members will step in and settle the issue and ensure punishments. \u2022ALL wars will be fought with NO item loss; unless BOTH clans want to fight the war with item loss enabled. \u2022The higher ranked clan will have choice over which arena the battle is fought in AND the choice over the use/effect of fighting with obstacles. \u2022There should be NO time limit on wars as they are FULL OUT ending a fight before time may change what the end result of the war might have been and is not needed. \u2022Once the details are chosen a clan may not change them unless agreed upon by the other clan. \u2022All wars MUST have AT LEAST two refs that are NOT in either clan. Each clan may choose their own ref but BOTH clans must agree to BOTH refs. A third ref may be put in place if the ladder feels it is necessary. Refs are to be announced to both clans at the time of war. They are not to be killed until the final stages of the war. \u2022There is a line at which flaming and spamming becomes unnecessary. If the refs decide that line is crossed, the offending clans are subject to punishment by the 3 Strike Rule. ~Memberlists and admin before wars~ Memberlists must be submitted 3 days after the war is accepted. These memberlists must contain only clanmembers and is not to be updated after the 3 day mark. All members that were accepted BEFORE the memberlists were submitted may participate in the war. This includes all members no matter how they are named. Any members recruited after the memberlists that were submitted may not fight in the war unless agreed upon by BOTH clans. Multi-clanners are not allowed. Any seen will be fixed before the war takes place. This does not include mini-game clans or GWD Clans. Any infringement of the rules will be looked as cheating and the clan will be punished according to the 3 Strike Rule. Declarations~ Clans may ONLY declare on another clan within 5 spots of their position on the ladder. Clans are allowed to declare on other clans as long as they declare on a clan with no immunity. When declaring, clans MUST create a declaration thread and post that declaration QFC to the ladder and their opponent. When declaring, clans MUST inform the clan they are declaring on by posting on their recruitment AND discussion threads (if they have any). They MUST also inform the ladder by posting on the ladder thread AND what rank they are declaring for. Clans that have won a rank MUST post what rank they won AND MUST post the decleration thread's QFC. They may post a results thread as well. Mass Declarations~ In the circumstances of Mass Declarations, clans must go through the same procedure, however the declarations (2-5) can all be on one thread. If the wars are accepted, it continues as before. If a few wars are declined, the declaring clan claims those ranks. However, the clans that they declared on, that haven't declined/accepted, can still fight them, even if the declaring clan is now above them on the ladder (through clans above them declining the declaration). Just as long as they accept the declaration within the normal 7 day time slot. The date when they war the clans can be discussed by the clans, and does not have to be in any set order. Clans are given EXACTLY 7 days to respond to a declaration. This is going by the time that they received the message informing them that they have been declared on. Clans that fail to respond in the 7 days will forfeit the war. Clans that have accepted a war but disbanded forfeit the war. If a clan is declared on but does not respond and then disbanded, the declaration is void and the only change is rank is the removal of the disbanded clan. Clans MAY accept wars even if they are immune. However, once they accept they cannot back out without losing the rank. Clans that have won a rank by default or by declining MUST post evidence of such victory or else the victory is considered void. ~When Negotiations Break Down~ -Each clan\u2019s ideal terms will be posted on the Council thread explaining why it should be them. -Each clan gets to post a response to the other Clans terms (further posts will be ignored). -Four or more council members will look at both proposed terms and rebuttals and will come up with a revised set of terms. -Each clan will give their opinions to the revised terms. -The council will acknowledge the points given and will make any amendments that needs doing. -The revised version will be issued as the new, solid war terms. ~Immunity~ Definition: exempted from war. Once a clan accepts a war both they and the challengers gain immunity from all other declarations. Immunity starts for the defending clan when the declaration is accepted and will last up to 7 days after the war is fought. IF the clan gains immunity after accepting the war, but pulls out before the war happens OR does not turn up to the war, the clan loses its immunity and forfeits the war as usual. Immunity is NOT given to clans who have been disqualified or that have forfeited wars. ~ Three Strike Rule ~ The Three Strike Rule is a punishment system used to deal with any breaking of the rules or problems that the ladder might have. The 3 strike system will be visually seen on the ladder, for example - Clan Woody - 105+ / 85 Members = No strikes Clan Woody - 105+ / 85 Members / 1st Jan 08 = 1 Strike Clan Woody - 105+ / 85 Members // 1st Jan 08 = 2 Strikes Clan Woody - 105+ / 85 Members /// 1st Jan 08 = 3 Strikes If a clan that has a visual /// (3 strikes) and breaks the rules again then that clan will stay on 3 strikes and will be punished according to the 3 strike rule. Removing of strikes - a strike will last in total 1 month, the date shown next to the strike indication will be when the last strike was issued. If there is more than one strike then the clan will have 2 strikes for a total of 1 month then 1 strike for another month. If a clan breaks the rules and is issued another strike then a new date is set and the countdown is reset to that date. The following is the punishments for each strike: First Strike: Punishment may vary on the majority of the offense Void war if declaring clan Loss of war if defending clan Loss of immunity Loss of ranks Second Strike: Suspension and all wars forfeited Disqualification and all wars forfeited Removed from the ladder and all wars forfeited Loss of immunity Loss of ranks and all wars forfeited Moved to the bottom of the ladder and all wars forfeited Third Strike: Suspension and all wars forfeited Disqualification and all wars forfeited Removed from the ladder and all wars forfeited Moved to the bottom of the ladder and all wars forfeit ~ Appeals Process ~ The appeals process is used ONLY when a clear winner cannot be established by discussion with the Ref(s) after viewing the videos and pics and will be a one count vote per ranked clan in the division. ~~ Banned Clans ~~ -- Souls Hunters -> Past 3 strikes.

This is because of its large amount of clans and the great dedication it currently has. Of course, we see these major criticisms often used, to describe some to many of the RSB wars. 1. The RSB Main Ladder is criticized for its low level of competition, compared to RAW. 2. The corruption of the RSB Council has been a constant criticism, since late April. Because of this, a lot of fighting has been occuring, with numerous bans, mutes, and more. 3. The bias of the threadholder or the RSB Council has been one of the largest issues. Many clans have argued this before. The very notable cases have been when clans warred the British Crusaders (former #1 clan in the ladder, now not in the ladder anymore). Because of the complaints, Exigence, Forgottengodz, and Wicked Fury have all quit the RSB at different times. All came back, however. 4. The in-clarity of the rules of the ladder have hurt this ladder a lot. However, as of late, many of these loopholes have been fixed. 5. The fact that there is more of a debate about the war than actual strategy during the war (or the feeling), causes many people to completely disassociate themselves with the RSB.See Also: Friend Chat The Total F2P Skillers Introduction  TFS is an F2P clan that promotes fairness to everyone and help to those who need it. We are a friendly clan and our goal is to create a positive environment where F2P players can meet others in hopes to find new buddies. Although we mainly focus on skilling, there are many people in TFS who enjoy combat as well. Ultimately, we try our best to have fun! TFS is a clan for F2P only since the founders have been friends for a long time and have always been F2P (and will always probably be). Because of their dedication to the F2P community, they have made a clan solely to those that are F2P. This means that TFS members cannot go to member events. We do not look for more and more clanmates or the best of the best skillers, but we do look for friendly and active F2P RuneScape Players.About Our Name  MAD is the very original founder of this clan and officially created it on July 21st, 2007, with the help of Scruffyo99 and Eminem777, the other leaders.Full Requirements  The basic and most simple requirement to becoming a member of TFS is to be a pure F2P. This means that in order to join this clan you must never have been a member. The next part of the requirement is to have at least 10M Overall Exp. If you do not meet our requirements, you are free to guest in the clan chat.P2P Policy  Training member's skills up to level 5 is allowed as it is a free-to-play feature. The usage of Bonds to gain membership is not allowed. However, using them to buy Treasure Hunter keys or RuneCoins is still allowed. We do not discriminate against members, therefore anyone is welcome to guest in the clan chat. If a TFS'er gets members while they are in the clan, they will be removed and given the rank of either Former TFS'er or Honored TFS'er on our forums, depending on their contribution to the clan during their stay. This means that multiple former clanmates still have access to our forums. Even though we do not accept member accounts in our clan, many have tried membership on an alternate account.Active Policy  We respect the events that happen to our members outside of RuneScape. Because of this, we are not too strict about being active. As long as you post on the forums, or go online once in a while, you will remain in the clan. Also, if you know that you will be inactive for a certain period of time, you can inform a staff member, or make a post in the appropriate place in the forums, so you will not be removed while you are away. Our events are not necessary to attend, therefore, if you do not attend the events, you will not be kicked out of the clan.T.F.S Main Rules  TFS has a few different rules to keep a friendly atmosphere, both in the clan chat and on the forums. If you break one or more of the rules you will either get warned or banned depending on how grave the offense was! You will get suspended if you break a rule! You will get banned after 5 Warnings!Clan Chat Rules  Do not be offended if you are kicked from the chat,our mods do what they have to to keep the CC free of offensive language and spam!Events  TFS Events can be anything, so long as they are F2P. We have had events from GOP Tournaments to Rev Hunts to Clan Wars and to just group skilling. Any member can create an event. However, those who create most of the TFS Events are Event Coordinators. To become a TFS Event Coordinator one must have made a few successful events, and be willing to put enough effort for the task. An EC may organize the evenst on the forums or just stick to creating events on the spot. Past events also included pillaging, drop parties, hide 'n seek, friendly battles, holiday events and many many more!Pictures of some TFS Events:  Here is a gallery of a small portion of the events we had. More coming soon.TFS Charity  TFS Charity is a continuous event started by Toky1337. Each week, we would gather to skill for an hour. At the end of three months, all the items that we acquired are put alongside other items into a giant drop, hence the name \"TFS Charity.\" Though TFS Charity hasn't been what it used to be, the fabled event is slowly returning to its prominence as Toky re-heads the event. Here are some of the drops that have been amassed from simple skilling within one hour:Staff Members Founders  The founders of the clan are Scruffyo99 and Bini (Eminem777). Even though they are mostly inactive, they both come back once in a while to make sure everything is going well within the clan.Moderators  TFS Administrators: TFS Admins help the leaders with everything, both on the forums and in the clan chat. They are the current in-game leaders of the clan. TFS Moderators: The Global Moderators ensure that rules are not broken on the forums and in the clan chat. Clan Chat Moderators: Clan Chat Mods prevent flame wars from erupting in the clan chat and make the clan chat a peaceful place for all to enjoy. The Administration of TFS is the key that allows TFS to remain in peace and be one of the leading F2P Clans of RuneScape.How to Join  To join the clan, make sure you meet our requirements, and then you can apply on our [http://w11.zetaboards.com/TTFS/index/ forums]. I'd strongly suggest to you to bookmark this link since it can get annoying to have to type it in the address bar. If, for whatever reason, you lose the link, you can always search \"Total F2P Skillers\" on Google. It will be the first result. If you have any further questions about TFS, please do not hesitate to visit our clan chat, \"TFS\". You can always PM one of the leaders or staff members. Hopefully we will meet you soon!\u00a0:)TFS Members  Note: these are not all the TFS members, just those who took a screenshot of themselves dressed in their best attire. A manually updated memberlist can be found on our\u00a0Runescape Clan Page.Trivia  \"We Bite\" is one of our standard replies in the TFS Applications section, started by Aging Miser. Before that, Moonshadow (Oylimpiana) used to greet new members with the phrase \"Hobo bites.\" \"The freaky schoolboys\" or \"The Freaking Spammers\" are parody phrases that also have the acronym TFS (more parody acronyms on forums). Spamming \"Walrus Walrus\" in clan wars is our way of saying, \"You noob! You don't know what TFS is?!\" It originated from when we would spam, \"war us.\" It was a type-o or an observation that turned \"war us\" into \"walrus.\" The 9 is very significant to TFS. This popular meme was started by Pownal1. Some even say that when joining TFS you are destined to be immortal under the careful guidance of the 9.World60Pengs  Please continue to use the old fashioned 'Friends Chat' channels (the green people tab) for penguin hunting. The (friends) chats, in order of use, remain: Or go to the thread in Minigames and D&Ds, Penguin Locations v###. (### changes weekly.) For more information on Penguin Hide & Seek in general, see the article on the RuneScape wiki.Tours  Team Penguin also runs tours to all non-wild, visible penguins. All you have to do is to follow a tour guide. For schedules and times of the tour buses, or if you want to help the Team with the tours, please see the thread in Minigames and D&Ds: Tour buses use the friends chats:Kaiser Blade  See more quotes here.Recent Updates Intro  Kaiser Blade will be a new clan installment of Guthix Blade. This is a POC Clan. We own Edgeville. Kaiser Blade is accepting members starting from today, July 23rd, 2009. Kaiser Blade is founded by Sjblade and will carry similar rules as Guthix Blade. This clan, unlike its predecessor, will feature more fighting such as weekly or even daily Clan Wars, Duel Arena, Bounty Hunter for those who qualify, and even PvP worlds if the everyone agrees to it. Of course the classic mining or woodcutting sessions are still available. Kaiser Blade will carry the previous tradition of owning most clans at Clan Wars. NOTE: The above images do not contain all the clan members of Kaiser Blade or Guthix Blade.History  Below is the history of Kaiser Blade that has been collected over time.Pre Kaiser Blade Era  See Guthix Blade.Silvabane and Revansuffer  Silvabane and Revansuffer were the first two members of Kaiser Blade. Revansuffer became the first Kaiser Blade member to only use Quick Chat.CORSAM  Grunge Devil came to Sjblade to convince us for alliance in a second war against BZP Chat. Kaiser Blade declined because they were making us part of their problem. Sjblade concluded that Kaiser Blade would offer no help whatsoever.POC & New Ideas  On July 29th, 2009, Kaiser Blade officially became a POC (Player-owned city. Kaiser Blade's council agreed to fight more effectively in Clan Wars as strategy is sometimes better than size. Since Kaiser Blade is a rather new clan, it can't always overcome every single clan since the size is still growing.Corsam and Kaiser Blade  On August 1st, the day of the Wikifest, The Corsam Clan aided Kaiser Blade in Clan Wars. Kaiser Blade plans on opening new trade opportunities with Corsam. Corsam and Kaiser Blade are now great allies.The Battle Against EE  There has been a recent struggle against EE. Kaiser Blade wanted to have an alliance with EE and this is their reward: Red dog. Are you sure of this? i wasnt considering allying with them.. i dont trust them. Kaiser Blade concluded that there is no point in trying to fight EE if they're just gonna turn down the offer each time.  EE is now an ally of Kaiser Blade.King Hero37  King Hero37 wanted to join this clan and was accepted. He then pulled this trick by logging on to another one of his accounts claiming to have once been a Guthix Blade general. This was indeed a big fat lie and King Hero37 got banned. Then he tried to use another account to join Kaiser Blade and soon was discovered to still be the same person. King Hero37 is now permanently banned due to the use of \"sockpuppets\" and deception.Silvabane, Revansuffer, and Mercurio 450  Revansuffer kicked fellow member Otokondo two times for no reason and started flaming about Sjblade. He was banned permanently from Kaiser Blade. Mercurio 450 came to\u00a0Silvabane to ask to spy on Kaiser Blade. Soon Mercurio left Guthix Fury and came back to Kaiser Blade telling everyone it was\u00a0Silvabane who asked Mercurio 450 to join. Silvabane soon used another account to spy on Kaiser Blade but later said it was just for finding out what Mercurio 450 said about Guthix Fury. In the end Mercurio 450 changed the story to how he went on Guthix Fury to joke about spying on us. Although we don't know who was really right. Destoryers14 made both of them start at Recruit rank.Problem Solved?  Silvabane was forgiven for his actions started again at Recruit and would go up. Mercurio 450 quit the clan due to excessive spamming of \"Derank me Pl0x!!!\". Later Arethied kicked Mercurio 450 but he then came back later to apologize for his actions. Kaiser Blade forgave Mercurio 450. All is well? Other News:The End of a Long Alliance  We have un-allied CORSAM, a skiller group, because of their annoyance, more specifically, their leader, Grunge Devil. He constantly comes into our cc and talks about Hayley Williams, and he even challenged us in a war.Kaiser Blade \"Adopted\"  With recent problems with Sjblade's in-activeness the clan required somebody else to \"Adopt\" Kaiser Blade. That person was Serius Rain (Arethied). Because of this, the new clanchat has been changed to K B Clan2. The main reason for the change is that because Sjblade has become inactive, there wasn't anybody to change ranks within the clan. With the change of leader and Channel, you may notice other changes within the clan.Leaving the Union  Kaiser Blade has left the Zerouh Triumvirate. The clan believes that they haven't done anything to help KB. However some members still keep a connection with Zerouh.Farcrusader and Team Falcon  On November 19, 2009, Team Falcon insulted Kaiser Blade. Farcrusader, a previous Captain in the clan Kaiser Blade, went into a very successful clan known as Team Falcon. He spammed the clan chat, making fun of Team Falcon. This ending us in almost having a war with Team Falcon.SeriuS RaiN's Decisions  The day after the Team Falcon incident, SeriuS RaiN learned of what Farcrusader did. He de-ranked Farcrusader, and he spared the other two spammers, being it was their first offense. SeriuS RaiN then decided to try to apologize with Team Falcon, which turned out into a great success. Up until this day, Team Falcon and Kaiser Blade have been good friends and allies.\u00a0 Ever since then, SeriuS has kept in touch with a special TF Member, TF TacoManFarcrusader's Revolt  Farcrusader logged on and quickly realized he was de-ranked to a Recruit. He was angered by this, and decided to leave the clan. He tried to convince AltairOwnsU, OwndPie, and JoeJayson into joining his clan. Farcrusader failed epically. When SeriuS RaiN heard about the revolt, he was quickly angered, and completely kicked out Farcrusader from the clan, and blocked him from entering. This would lead into an all out war.The Blood Legion War  Kaiser Blade went into a war against Blood Legion after Farcrusader's Revolt. The second Farcrusader logged on, SeriuS RaiN and his men bought armor and runes so that they can fight in a battle. SeriuS RaiN contacted Farcrusader, but he did not go to war right away. They met in Varrock Square, but no-one from Blood Legion was around him. He said that they were still coming, but everyone from Kaiser Blade knew that was a false statement, and that Farcrusader had no real clan mates. SeriuS marched on to the Clan Wars lobby regardless. In the middle of walking there, Farcrusader logged off. So, instead of a war with Blood Legion, they had a regular war with a clan that was worth the money spent on rune and runes (Rune and Runes lol..). Farcrusader then logged back on, and SeriuS challenged him to a war. Farcrusader said that\u00a0 SeriuS had no honor and it was an unfair fight. This again was a false statement. Kaiser Blade never fought the Blood Legion and it was basically a lame excuse to get out of the war.The Return of Sjblade  On December 6th, 2009, Sjblade made a public announce on the forums of his return. There have been no attempts from Sjblade to readopt Kaiser Blade from SeriuS RaiN.Farcrusader's Cheap Tactics  One day, Farcrusader finally had the balls to go to war. Jesus Shad0w originally went to world 7, however, he wanted us to go to world 32. It was a Bounty Hunter world, but the leader didn't care. Farcrusader told him to follow him into his \"army\", which just turned out to be World 32 Pkers. When Jesus Shad0w died, Farcrusader laughed hysterically. However, IT WASN'T HIS ARMY, BUT FARCRUSADER STILL INSISTED THAT IT WAS! But since Jesus Shad0w could afford full rune,he didn't care, but Farcrusader's actions still made him mad.Kaiser Blade vs Blood Legion  The Blood Legion challenged Kaiser Blade on December 24th (GMT Time). The battle was fought on the 24th. The Blood Legion lost, even with their level 126 member. The first two matches was an 8 versus 4. Farcrusader had just recruited 2 people to the war minutes beforehand. The final match was a 4 versus 4, to make it fair for Farcrusader. Kaiser Blade's four players were CC UMAD NERD, Jesus Shad0w, Jesus 1ce, and Otokondo against Farcrusader, Feurey, a lvl 91, and a lvl 85. Even though they lost, Farcrusader, their leader, took the loss like a leader should. We respect Blood Legion for that aspect. Blood Legion's clan page does not think it was a fair fight though, since he lacked recruiting skills however we did make it fair with a 4 on 4. The final score was 3-0 Kaiser Blade. The only KB Casualty was Jesus Shad0w, the KB Leader.Kaiser Blade Readopted  Sjblade has taken the clan back from Jesus Shad0w. Jesus however will remain a leader as he can reach out to the P2P members and still keep his rules. Jesus has the power to make decisions however he cannot start wars and etc without Sjblade's consultment.Farewell WherE BK aT  WherE BK aT (Jesus Shad0w) announced in clan chat that he was resigning from Kaiser Blade. He wanted to go solo. Before he left, BK told Sjblade to make Arethied his 2nd in Command. BK's presence will be missed from the members of Kaiser Blade. Farewell BK. - SjbladeThe Great Division  Kaiser Blade has split into two clans, Eternal Frost and Dark Order though Kaiser blade has few members, it is still available to join.KB Alex  Kaiser Blade now has a new tenant leader, KB Alex.Exodus  KB Alex has resigned as leader because any new members of Kaiser Blade would soon join Army of Saradomin or go solo. There is no leader in Kaiser Blade and the clan has now ended. Kaiser Blade has been through good and bad. But with all things good, it has to end sometime. The time has since passed... Kaiser blade is back!

Lastly, The Spartan will be put u against a monster or another player based apon their ability. If pitted against another trainee, the trainee who wins the fight will be able to join the army as a Hopolite.Wilderness Guardians Introduction  The Wilderness Guardians (Shortened to WildGuard, initialised WG) is a clan founded by His Lordship in 2003. The name \"Wilderness Guardians\" originally represented the clan's focus of protecting non-PKers in the Wilderness; today it represents the protection of the old ways of honour. In the many years of it's existence, WG (or WildGuard) has become one of the most renowed RuneScape clans, noteably for their revolutionary and impressive feats and accomplishments. WG has hosted multiple real-life meetings, has for sale a clan t-shirt, owns one of the best websites of any clan in any game online, and much more which gives the clan its uniqueness. One of the most prominent features is WG's endorsement by Jagex, the creators of RuneScape. WG has also been a strong influential force and has changed the face of RuneScape and its clan world over the years, both directly and indirectly. In 2007, it was widely agreed that WildGuard was the #3 P2P multi clan, under Damage Incorporated and RuneScape Dinasty. WG remains one of the ten oldest surviving clans active in RuneScape to date. His Lordship is recognised as the oldest clan leader serving a consecutive term in the rank. The clan has a steady amount of around fifty to sixty active members, and a strong community between them. WG is still an active P2P multi clan, hosting at least three official PKing trips (Known as \"Raids\") per week, and at least one full-scale war per month, as well as keeping a balance with skilling and fun events. WG is ranked #9 on the Tip.It War Rankings.History  WildGuard was started by His Lordship on December 6th, 2003, following his post on the Rune Village fansite's forums entitled \"Read This If You Hate PKers\". The clan, originally known as \"The PK PKs\" was based around the concept of Anti-Player Killing, or APKing (See \"Advocates\"). The idea received an incredible response from the community, with at least 30 members joining within 2 days of opening, some sources saying 60-70. Along with a name change to the Wilderness Guardians, they gained the support of The Sabres (One of only two surviving pre-RuneScape clans and the strongest APKing clan at the time) and joined the Federation on December 19th - a syndicate of clans who shared honour-based principles. Over the years, WG has caused, shared and experienced far too much to be written briefly. The clan is one of, if not the most influential RuneScape clan ever to have existed. WG has truimphantly recovered from near death, its members have shaken hands in 5 continents around the world, and the clan has been on the cutting edge to the extent that almost every serious clanner knows of the Wilderness Guardians. Three accounts of WG's history have been written and are constantly updated - a basic, a condensed and an extended version. All three of these accounts appear on WG's official website.Sub-Sections Runescape PvP Runescape Non PvP Real Life Other Clan Aspects Historical Elements Members References RSB  \"RSB\" is an acronym used by users of RuneScape to describe the official RuneScape Forums. \"RSB\" means \"RuneScape Boards\", which includes all of the clan forums within the RuneScape site. It is most commonly used by the clanning community. The forums within the RSB are: A Forum for players looking for a clan. They can post threads here which clan leaders can read and post an advertisement for their clan. A Forum for clans with a level requirement of under 100 combat to post their recruitment threads. A Forum for clans with a level requirement of at least 100 combat to post their recruitment threads. A Forum for clans with either no level requirement or a non-combat requirement to post their recruitment threads. A Forum for general discussion of the clan community. Many clan newspapers are posted here. A Forum for clans to post their main clan thread, which contains all the information about the clan and has any important news in. A Forum for diplomacy. Clans man make alliances and enemies, declare wars or propose merge events. A Forum for people to post suggestions for new clan related features. A Forum about The Jagex Cup. This is a competition between clans run by Jagex. The term RSB is most commonly used by members of the two major Runescape clan communities. During the year 2007, the RSB underwent a rapid expansion, causing a great influx in activity, and causing many changes to the forums and the community. After this influx in activity died out, the RSB began to dwindle. The year 2008 is now referred to as the \"Dark Ages\" of the RSB. Popular activities within the RSB include joining and expanding clans, participating in events, and contributing to Clan Newspapers or threads within the Clan Community section dedicated to ranking clans, leaders, ASCII Artists, etc. and giving updated information on recent activities within other sections of the RSB.See Also: Da-Chia Clan  The Da-Chia Clan (name derived from \"Da\" in Dagoth62 and \"Chia\" in Chiafriend12), abbreviated as DCC, is a level 60+ members' only safe-PKing clan with about 58 members founded by Dagoth62 and Chiafriend12 in September, 2006. Currently, the clan is inactive, and is not accepting new applicants.History  The Da-Chia's lifespan was only just a bit under two years, but it was definitely longer than how long most clans last.2006: Beginnings  In September of 2006, before most people nowadays played RuneScape, during one lunch break at school, Dagoth62 and Chiafriend12 had a simple idea: \"Let's start a clan\". They recruited Matt Degoth and Jack Of Horn, two other good friends from school, and made them the second and third-in-command respectively of the new clan. The idea of the clan's name-to-be was to name it after the founders. The \"Da\" from Dagoth62's username, the \"Chia\" from Chiafriend12's username, and \"Clan\" at the end. In-game, some recruitment went on, getting the clan about eight members total by October. In December, Chiafriend12 joined the RuneScape Wiki, and later made a recruitment thread, more than doubling the clan's size over a short period of time.2007: Flourishment  Over the course 2007, the clan's size grew to about 45, with only one defection. With more members, weekly clan meetings were held to keep members informed on upcoming events, new recruits and promotions. A clan site was established sometime early in the year, but it had little activity. About every month, clan events were held in minigames (usually Castle Wars and Pest Control), in which most clan members attended. Excluding one event in Pest Control, each event reigned successful. Having originally allowed players of any level to join the clan, a rule was set in place: Players with level 60 combat or more would be allowed into the normal ranks, and players with below 60 combat were given \"in-training\" ranks, which fell below even Private. This was later replaced with a rule stating that a player had to simply have 60 combat to join, so lower leveled players who were more likely to quit wouldn't clog the roster. Any remaining active in-training members were promoted to Private. It was also made members' only to help keep members who would just end up quitting from joining. When Clan Chats were introduced, the official Da-Chia Clan chat was designated as Chiafriend12's, and still is. In September, a recruitment thread went up on the Offical Forums, only gaining one recruit, and got bumped off the 50 page due to lack of clan members bumping it. Though, back when the thread was made, there were only a few forum areas dedicated to clans, as opposed to now, as there are currently several to prevent threads from being deleted so soon. Around the end of the year (in coincidence with the removal of free trade and traditional PKing), many members became inactive from RuneScape, leaving about only 20 active members at the most. But with Clan Wars up and running, the clan had safe wars often, since the far majority of the clan weren't pures and didn't like non-safe-PKing.2008: Inactivity  In 2008, the clan saw the last of its initial glory days. Somewhere around March, a RuneHead was put in place to keep track of the clan's roster, rather by Clan Chat listing. Starting in either April or May, with FunOrb having been released, the clan sometimes fought others in Arcanists in groups of three, because of the max limit of six people per game. But by February even, the clan did very little with one another, and it was officially declared inactive in July. A few mergers were thought of, but nothing ever happened with them.2009: Revival?  Starting around December of 2008, Chiafriend12 started to go Clan Warring every week or so, and because of his moderatorship, often got as much as 20 or more people in his Clan Chat at once; the most being 55. The Da-Chia could end up being revived, but as a clan that bands together and disbands every event instead of having an actual roster. This is how most clans at Clan Wars are like.Leadership and Government  The Da-Chia Clan uses Direct Democracy normally, and Hierarchal Oligarchy during combat situations. While not in a war or any other combat situation, Direct Democracy is used for all sorts of things: if a said member should be made an officer, what today's event shall be, someone's promotion, new policies, etc.. Though, for times of war, combat and chaos, Hierarchal Oligarchy takes over. What this means is that whoever has the higher rank makes the decisions, and the subordinates are supposed to fulfill those orders. For example, a Corporal may tell a ranger Private to take a position which would be ideal for sniping meleeists. A Sergeant may tell the both of them to instead follow him on a flanking mission. Even after that, a Captain could them order all of them to fall back and regroup with other members of the clan. Lastly, a Commander may tell them to take up ambushing positions similar to the Corporal's idea. Since there would be no one higher ranked than the leader, that decision would usually be final. During Hierarchal Oligarchy, it is still possible for a lower ranked member to make an order. For example, if a group of ten clan members led by a Lieutenant are waiting to ambush and a Private recommends that they should find a new position elsewhere, the Lieutenant could approve the idea. If the Lieutenant disagrees, then the Private's idea would be vetoed.Hierarchy  The Da-Chia Clan has a United States Army-based hierarchy. Up until Senior Corporal, the insignia mirrors or closely resembles that of the United States Army enlisted rank insignia. For the Sergeant ranks, United States Air Force insignia is used. Unlike most clans, ranks are proportional. For example, per every sergeant, there would be five subordinates. Also unlike most clans, combat levels won't influence ranks that much. General is the only rank in which a higher level is needed. \u200eDifficulty  The table below explains the difficulty that clan members must face to get the specified rank.Member list  Below is a list of members of the Da-Chia, with their probable combat level. Most of the members are inactive, as said earlier in the article. Combat levels listed have a high chance of being out of date, so the actual combat level is bound to be higher than listed. Many that went inactive have not logged in since before Christmas of 2007, so getting knowledge of their level would be difficult. Levels are also bound not to be exactly correct. Friends, Allies and Conscripts are not listed.Enlisted  Privates Private Grade 1s Corporals Senior Corporals Sergeant Grade 3s Sergeant Grade 2s Sergeant Grade 1s Senior Sergeants Sergeant MajorsOfficers  Lieutenant Grade 2s Lieutenant Grade 1s Senior Lieutenants Captains Brigadier Generals Two-Star Generals Master Generals Commander Grade 2s Commander Grade 1sWar history  Below is a general list of declared wars with other clans or individuals and their outcomes.

Released 21 years after Of Myths and Monsters, it is considered to be the revival of the long-dormant series. Project Sora is the developer, with Masahiro Sakurai as the lead designer and writer. The game was released on March 22nd in Japan, March 23rd in the US and Europe, and March 29th in Australia.Plot  25 years after the original Kid Icarus, Medusa has been resurrected and once again attempts to eradicate mankind while seeking revenge on Pit and Palutena. Upon learning this, Palutena summons Pit to stop the Underworld Army and bring peace to their realm once more. Medusa retaliates by putting forward her faithful watchdog, Twinbellows, and her commanders, Hewdraw, Pandora, and Thanatos. However, before Pit defeats Pandora, the goddess of calamity clones him using the Mirror of Truth, bringing about the creation of Dark Pit. After a brief fight between the two angels, Palutena decides to refocus her efforts on the Underworld Army. She then sends Pit to the Galactic Sea, where he fights a faction known as the Space Pirates in order to reclaim the Three Sacred Treasures. Once Pit obtains the treasures, he immediately heads for the Underworld and faces off against Medusa. However, it is only after her defeat that they realize their enemy was not actually Medusa, but rather Hades, the true ruler of the Underworld. Relishing in the chaos and destruction of others, Hades tricks the humans into thinking that the mythical Wish Seed has been taken, causing a massive war to break out amongst their own species. This, in turn, draws out the goddess of nature, Viridi, who launches a Reset Bomb onto the Overworld to restore the balance of nature by eradicating mankind. As Pit fights these new enemy forces, the destruction grabs the attention of the Aurum, an alien species that seeks to destroy the earth and harvest its resources for their own agenda. The self-proclaimed Sun God, Pyrrhon, joins in soon after, and the previously warring gods unite to eliminate the alien threat. However, Pyrrhon betrays his allies, fusing with the Aurum Brain in order to take control of their fleet. Pit then defeats Pyrrhon, forcing the god to retreat back into space along with the rest of the Aurum. In the aftermath of the Aurum invasion, Pit awakens 3 years later and finds that his soul is sealed inside of a ring. While trying to figure out what happened, he takes control of the bodies of a girl, a dog, and eventually Magnus, who informs Pit that Palutena's Army began attacking mankind during the angel's absence. Afterwards, Pit fights and reclaims his own body, then attempts to contact Palutena in order to sort out what had happened during the last 3 years. However, Viridi answers Pit's calls instead and uses the power of flight to fly him to Skyworld, where he encounters the projection of a possessed Palutena. After Pit discovers that a force-field surrounding Palutena's Temple is preventing him from reaching his goddess, Viridi extracts him and brings him back to her own headquarters to regroup. Viridi sends Pit to the Lightning Chariot Base in order to borrow a vehicle known as the Lightning Chariot, which possesses the ability to break through the force-field surrounding Palutena's Temple. However, the Chariot Master is reluctant to hand it over, forcing Pit to fight him for it. After the Chariot Master's death, Pit takes control of the Lightning Chariot and uses it to break through Palutena's barrier. Viridi then tells Pit of the Chaos Kin, the creature that is controlling Palutena. Pit travels through the temple and engages Palutena in battle, defeating the Chaos Kin and freeing her of its control. However, the Chaos Kin snatches Palutena's soul away, causing her body to turn to stone as it flees into the Chaos Vortex. With the help of Dark Pit, Pit pursues the Chaos Kin into the Chaos Vortex and engages it in battle, ultimately reclaiming Palutena's soul. As Pit and Palutena reunite, the ashes of the Chaos Kin spring to life and latch onto Dark Pit, pulling him from the platform they were standing on and sending him plummeting through the air below. Pit rushes after him and uses the power of flight to save him, but because he had already exhausted his flight prior, his wings catch fire. The injuries to Pit's wings leave the angel in critical condition, forcing Dark Pit to travel to the Underworld in order to save him. With Palutena's help, Dark Pit brings Pit's unconscious body to the Rewind Spring, which returns his wings to their original state. Having been brought back from the brink of death, Pit equips himself with the Three Sacred Treasures and faces off against Hades. However, the lord of the Underworld destroys the treasures, prompting Pit and Palutena to seek out the god of the forge, Dyntos, for a new weapon with which they can use to defeat Hades. After Pit undergoes the god's tedious trials, Dyntos grants Pit the Great Sacred Treasure. Pit faces off against Hades once again, engaging him in a massive battle that spans from the Underworld to the Overworld. Along the way, Hades gradually breaks down the Great Sacred Treasure, forcing Pit to destroy him using the treasure's cannon alone. Upon Hades's defeat, Pit begins to celebrate his victory against the god, only for Viridi to reiterate her stance on humanity. Palutena tells Viridi that she should let Pit enjoy his victory for the time being, and both he and Dark Pit fly off into the sunset together.Gameplay Solo Mode  Solo Mode is where the main game and its story takes place. This mode is divided into 25 chapters that each represent a stage, which is usually comprised of an Air Battle, a Land Battle and a Boss Battle. Before starting a chapter, the player is able to place hearts into the Fiend's Cauldron to increase the difficulty of the chapter. The higher the difficulty, the better the rewards found within the chapters.Air Battle  In this game, Pit is granted the Power of Flight from Palutena, giving him the ability to fly for a limited amount of time. The areas where this ability is used resemble a free-aiming flight mode, where Pit can fly in one direction and aim in another, reminiscent of the Palace in the Sky in the original Kid Icarus. While flying, Palutena will control Pit's flight path, but most of the dodging and attacking is left to Pit to handle.Land Battle  On land, Pit must progress to his destination by overcoming hordes of enemies. These ground sections make up most of the game. In this segment, Pit's movement is entirely left up to the player.Boss Battles  At the end of every chapter, Pit faces off with a boss character. These range from fighting massive monsters such as Twinbellows, to battling more humanoid characters like Dark Lord Gaol. In some cases, such as with Hewdraw or Dark Pit, a portion of the boss fight may begin in the air, then continue on land.Together Mode  Together Mode is split up into two play styles: Light vs. Dark and Free-for-All. In Light vs. Dark, players are split into teams of three and tasked to defeat opponent players. There is a team life gauge, which decreases with each death of a teammate. The amount of points it drops by is determined by the weapon value, thus, the higher the value, the more points will be lost. When the gauge has been fully depleted, the player whose death fully depleted the gauge becomes that team's Angel, which is Pit for the Light team and Dark Pit for the Dark team. From here on, the goal is to kill the Angel, which is more difficult than it appears as Angels have increased health, attack power, and defense. In Free-for-All, up to six players are pit against each other and must rely on themselves to gain the highest amount of kills.Weapons  Pit starts with a basic First Blade, but as he progresses, he can gain a very large arsenal of powerful weapons that can be chosen from before each stage. Each weapon is able to perform melee, ranged, dash and charged attacks. Twelve different weapons are available for each category, and with 9 categories, Kid Icarus: Uprising boasts a total of 108 different weapons. The weapon categories are: Blades, Staffs, Claws, Bows, Palms, Clubs, Cannons, Orbitars, and Arms.Powers  Powers are new items that give different abilities to Pit for use in battle. They each have different effects when used, ranging from unleashing powerful attacks to recovering Pit's health.Vehicles  In addition to these weapons and abilities, Pit is able to utilize armed vehicles in battle and for transportation, which include a mech-like armor known as the Cherubot, a sphere-shaped vehicle known as the Aether Ring, and a beetle-like vehicle known as the Exo Tank.AR Cards  The game also features compatibility with the Kid Icarus AR Cards, which allows players to see 3D models of all characters, enemies, items, locations, and weapons using the Nintendo 3DS's dual cameras. By scanning two cards at once, battles can be waged between the different models, each of which have their own stats and health bars.Development  In July 2008, Satoru Iwata approached Masahiro Sakurai and asked that he make a game for the then upcoming Nintendo 3DS handheld system. After the release of Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Iwata felt that it wouldn't be right to release another game in the same series so soon, so he specifically requested that Sakurai create something original. With this in mind, Sakurai came up with the idea of a shooting game that had both Air Battles and Land Battles. Despite the initial request, however, Sakurai wondered if he could use the idea to revive an older Nintendo series. He briefly considered turning the project into a Star Fox game, but, in the end, decided that Pit's character and the setting of Kid Icarus made a better fit for what he had in mind. According to Sakurai, he wrote a project proposal and the script before the creation of Project Sora. When they started production on Uprising, the 3DS development kit was not available yet, so they had to use a PC and a Wii to develop the game before eventually moving production to the 3DS. During development, three extra chapters had been planned for Uprising's story, but they had to be scrapped early on due to unknown reasons. Additionally, Sakurai had also considered placing a mascot-like character by Pit's side to act as his support, but ultimately abandoned the idea when he felt the dynamic between Pit and Palutena would work better. When it came to Uprising's overall atmosphere, Sakurai wished to keep it in line with the humorous tone of the first Kid Icarus game, which was different compared to the darker nature of other games released at that time. With this in mind, the development team was careful not to let Uprising's graphics and story steer too closely to more serious titles such as God of War, another game with heavy Greek mythological influences. In regards to the story, Sakurai expressed that he didn't want to stick strictly to a formula of good versus evil. Instead, he wrote a script involving different factions clashing over their opposing ideals and different ways of thinking, with each one joining the fray adding another layer of chaos to the game's plot.Localization  One of the changes made between releases was to the game's cover: while the Japanese boxart features Pit smiling and flying against a blue and pink sky background, the English boxart changed his expression to look more determined and the pink hues were removed. Additionally, the Monoeyes and Syrens shown in the background were moved to appear closer to Pit. Because many of the jokes in the original script for Uprising relied heavily on the subtle nuances of Japanese language and culture, Sakurai gave the Nintendo Treehouse development team a lot of leeway in the localization of the script so that it would feel more natural for English speakers. As a result, many conversations and jokes were rewritten for English audiences, though many of the lines making references to other games were taken directly from the Japanese script. During the voice-acting process, most of the voice actors recorded their lines separately from each other, basing their performances on previously recorded lines or lines read to them from a script. Antony Del Rio and Ali Hillis, the voice actors of Pit and Palutena, respectively, recorded their lines alongside one another for roughly half of the game. However, due to conflicts in their schedules, the two were forced to record the rest of their lines separately.Music  The music for Kid Icarus: Uprising was composed by Motoi Sakuraba, Yuzo Koshiro, Masafumi Takada, Noriyuki Iwadare, Takahiro Nishi, and Yasunori Mitsuda, which were many of the same artists who worked on Super Smash Bros. Brawl. Takahiro Nishi acted as the music director, and the orchestral arrangements were handled by Natsumi Kameoka and Yasunori Mistuda. Takahiro Nishi and Masahiro Sakurai held private meetings, where they would discuss which composers would be right for which parts of the game. According to Sakurai, since the beginning their ultimate goal for the soundtrack was to \"match the whirlwind of changing events in the air battles.\" Managing the timing perfectly was extremely difficult to everyone involved, and it was the first time Sakurai had experienced such a tedious project in regards to sound. Motoi Sakuraba said that he created the main theme, which gave him the most trouble due to his unfamiliarity with the game's overview. Yuzo Koshiro stated that throughout development, he kept in mind to match the scene while being sure not to interfere with the dialogue. Masafumi Takada recalled that he was confused by his work on Kid Icarus: Uprising due to his first impression of the game being Chapter 5. He also stated that during one of his days off, he was suddenly struck with inspiration for a melody which was later used in the \"Lightning Chariot Base\" track. Natsumi Kameoka was responsible for taking individual pieces of music and arranging them into a complete track, then adjusting the speed to fit into the game. Yasunori Mitsuda mentioned that the team conducted most of the soundtrack through live recordings which took seven recording sessions to complete, leading him to believe that this project was likely the largest-scale production of any video game score at the time. A promotional selection of music from the video game's soundtrack was given out to Club Nintendo members of Japan on March 22nd, 2012, while a 3 Disk version of the soundtrack was released in Japan on August 21st in the same year.Promotional Material Kid Icarus Float  From August 4th to August 8th in 2011, a Kid Icarus float was featured at a summer festival in the Aomori Prefecture in Japan. It stood at a height of almost 40 feet and depicted Pit striking a pose with Palutena standing in the background. An exclusive AR Card was released to commemorate the event, granting the player the Kid Icarus Float Idol.Kid Icarus Puzzle Swap  In February 2012, the Nintendo 3DS's Puzzle Swap feature was updated to include a Kid Icarus: Uprising-themed puzzle. The sheet contains 40 puzzle pieces\u20148 of which are pink\u2014and features a looping animation of Pit in Chapter 1's Land Battle fighting and dodging Monoeyes.Kid Icarus Choco Snacks  On March 12th, 2012, Nintendo teamed up with Takara Tomy to release Kid Icarus: Uprising Choco Snacks. Costing \u00a5100 per bag, each pack came with a small handful of chocolate snacks, as well as 1 out of 20 possible AR Cards.Kid Icarus 3D Anime  Before the release of the game, Nintendo created three animated shorts for the 3DS's Nintendo Video service with the help of three well known Japanese animation studios: Production I.G, Studio 4\u00b0C and Shaft, Inc.Kid Icarus Manga  CoroCoro and V Jump magazines both released short manga in April 2012, the former featuring Twinbellows and the latter featuring Hewdraw.Kid Icarus Figma  In April 2013, Figma figures of Pit and Dark Pit were released by Good Smile and Max Factory. They individually costed \u00a53,619, and each came with two AR Cards: Monoeye and Pit (Injured), and Dark Pit (Flying) and Magnus and Gaol, respectively.Reception  While receiving generally positive reviews for its story, characters, graphics, and writing, Kid Icarus: Uprising is commonly criticized for its overall control scheme, especially in regards to left-handed players. Regardless, Uprising got a perfect 40/40 score on Famitsu, and sold 132,526 units in its first week. This boosted sales of the Nintendo 3DS dramatically, increasing it from 64,017 to 94,011. Additionally, Nintendo Power released a list of its top 285 Nintendo games of all time for its final issue. While the original Kid Icarus ranked 140th, Uprising ranked 64th. As of April, 2013, it sold 1.18 million units, making it one of Nintendo's best selling 3DS games at that time.External Links AR Cards  AR Cards (short for Augmented Reality Cards) are cards that were manufactured for compatibility with the Nintendo 3DS. By scanning a Kid Icarus AR Card to a copy of Kid Icarus: Uprising, the player will receive an Idol, as well as 100 Hearts.Functionality  According to Masahiro Sakurai, the 3DS's camera recognizes the images on AR Cards at a resolution of 4 by 4, and reads the \"colorbit\" at the bottom left-hand side of the card. By scanning an AR Card, an animated 3D model which corresponds to the card will appear on screen. When scanning two AR Cards at once, the player can position them so that the arrows at the bottom of the cards face each other, causing the two cards to engage in battle.Availability  Most of the cards were available through booster packs, though a handful of others were obtainable through different means. Some were available through Club Nintendo, in strategy guide books, in various magazines, in first edition versions of the 3 disk soundtrack, packaged along with Pit and Dark Pit's Figma figures, and other, more obscure means. Initially, AR Cards 405 and 411 (Medusa (Rare) and Pit (Victory) respectively) were never released physically, making their Idols only obtainable through hacking\u2014however, Pit (Victory) was made available digitally on December 4th, 2018 when Kid Icarus: Uprising's official Twitter account revealed the full AR Card in celebration of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate's release. Whether or not Medusa (Rare) will be released is currently unknown.Regional Differences  The code at the bottom left corner of AR Cards always begins with the letters AKD; however, the last letter in the code is dependent on region: AKDE is used for North American cards, AKDP is used for PAL cards, and AKDJ is used for Japanese cards. North American and Japanese AR Cards have completely identical appearances, with the exception of their names and codes. PAL AR Cards are notably different from these two, with a colored border around the card's image, multiple different translations listed below the name of the card, and a lack of affiliation listed above the card name. Additionally, only PAL versions have a wing in the top right corner to signify a card's rarity, with a silver wing signifying uncommon, a golden wing signifying rare, and a diamond wing signifying ultra rare.Prototype AR Cards  Prior to Uprising's release, beta cards of Pit, Palutena, and Medusa were given out at E3, San Diego Comic-Con, PAX Prime, and a Las Vegas, NV GameStop Conference in 2011. All three of these cards featured different art of each character, the beta logo of Uprising, and lacked a colorbit in the bottom left corner. However, despite the colorbit's absence, the cards can still be scanned. There are also beta cards of Magnus, Hewdraw, Dark Lord Gaol, the Fighter, a Monoeye, a Stackjaw, a Fire Wyrm, a Syren, a Mik, a Skuttler, the Standard Orbitars, the First Blade, the Violet Palm, the Crusher Arm, the EZ Cannon, the Tiger Claws, and the Fortune Bow; however, any information regarding whether or not these were ever distributed to the public is currently unknown.Available with Kid Icarus: Uprising  Copies of Kid Icarus: Uprising came with a pack of six randomly selected AR Cards, which can be identified by the unique CXA code located in the bottom right corner of the card.Other Cards Club Nintendo Cards  013.

Kid Icarus FloatDark Pit  Dark Pit is a major character in Kid Icarus: Uprising. He is the flawed, incomplete clone of Pit created by the Mirror of Truth. He serves as a rival to Pit, clashing with him multiple times throughout the game. He is currently an officer in the Forces of Nature. He is voiced by Antony Del Rio in the English version of Uprising, and by Minami Takayama in the Japanese version of the game.Characteristics Physical Appearance  Dark Pit appears as a young teen with narrowed red eyes and short, black hair. His black chiton is decorated with purple and gold trimming, and it is fastened on the shoulder by a golden fibula with a purple gem in the center. He wears a purple belt with gold lining the edges and a gold, triangular buckle on his waist. He also wears black tights under his chiton, which are trimmed with gold. To adorn his outfit, Dark Pit has a pair of black and gold cuffs around his forearms, and singular gold rings on his upper left arm and right thigh. His black sandals are decorated with crossing, gold bands, and are edged at the top with gray fur. With the exception of color, his appearance is almost entirely identical to Pit's. However, while Pit's wings are drawn to be rounder and fuller, Dark Pit's wings are drawn to be sharper and narrower. This distinction only exists in his official art, and is never given attention in any of his in-game models.Personality  As Dark Pit is the physical manifestation of Pit's dark side, Dark Pit is said to represent the repressed feelings that Pit keeps to himself. Dark Pit is significantly more serious than his jovial counterpart, often having a more dry sense of humor. He is also more arrogant and cocky, claiming to be the original Pit. Additionally, Dark Pit is more aggressive and pragmatic than Pit, often striking opponents when their guard is down. Dark Pit proves to be sharper than Pit, possessing more common sense. This is shown when he deduces that it would take more than one soul to create an Underworld monster. Dark Pit's most notable trait is his independent streak. As the Mirror of Truth was destroyed before the process could be complete, Dark Pit becomes a neutral character, refusing to side with any of the gods. This is shown when he defies Pandora, and flat out refuses Medusa's offer for an alliance. He even openly calls out the gods for their selfishness, claiming that they are no better than humans as their wars throw the world off balance. During the Chaos Kin arc, Dark Pit's personality begins to progressively change. Once he realizes that his life is directly connected to Pit's, he becomes one of Pit's closest allies, fighting alongside him in order to rescue Palutena's soul. When Pit sacrifices himself to save Dark Pit, he is determined to save Pit at all costs, though it is possible that he still acts out of selfishness to keep his own life. Because Dark Pit seems to care for Pit yet remains belligerent towards him, he and Pit share a somewhat incoherent relationship.Abilities  Dark Pit, true to his state as a clone, has a very similar fighting style to Pit. While he proves to be more aggressive, he can dodge, melee, shoot, and use a variety of weaponry like his rival. During Chapter 6, Pit must fight Dark Pit four times: on and off during the air battle, twice during the land battle, and once as a boss battle. In the two randomly occurring land battle duels, he uses different weapons depending on his location. The list below accounts for them: During the last battle in Chapter 6, Dark Pit will use the Silver Bow. He will fire charged dash shots after getting up close, but sometimes he uses continuous fire. Dark Pit has the added advantage of inexhaustible flight, given to him by Pandora's remains. He will fly around on occasion, moving away from the platform. Aside from shooting, he has two new moves when doing this. The first is the bow's special attack, which sends down a rain of arrows. This engulfs an entire platform and can cause significant damage. The second is a charging attack, where he glows purple and charges at Pit. When playing as Dark Pit in Chapter 22, he will use any weapon the player provides him with. He also shows the ability to use powers just as Pit can. While Pit will often shout Palutena's or Viridi's names when using a power, Dark Pit will say phrases such as \"Come on!\" or \"Take this!\" Dark Pit's indefinite Power of Flight also becomes apparent, as the player flies for most of the level, only landing for the boss battle with Pandora.Appearances Kid Icarus: Uprising Solo Mode  Dark Pit first appears in Chapter 5 after being manufactured by the Mirror of Truth just as Pit destroys it. Though Pandora arranged for his creation and intended to have him finish Pit off for her, it turned out the Mirror of Truth cracked in the middle of the process, thus making Dark Pit a free agent. After battling against her, Dark Pit knocks Pit away and absorbs Pandora's remains, obtaining an unlimited Power of Flight in the process. While being chased by Pit and the Underworld Army, Dark Pit sees himself to be the true Pit as he embodies the original's true feelings. This fact also makes Dark Pit an enemy of Medusa and her army as he battles Pit before escaping. He later reappears to indirectly help Pit by taking out Underworld troops and the Underworld Gatekeeper. In the aftermath of the Aurum invasion, Pit's soul was sealed in a ring, leaving Dark Pit in a coma for three years. After Pit regains his body, Dark Pit comes to and realizes he and Pit share a special connection. Dark Pit then resolves to save Palutena by borrowing the Lightning Chariot and slamming it into the closing portal to the Chaos Vortex, allowing him and Pit to chase after the Chaos Kin. Though the two manage to defeat it, the Chaos Kin's burnt body made a final attempt on Dark Pit's life, leading Pit to sacrifice his wings to save him. Wanting to help Pit, Dark Pit heads to the City of Souls in order to reach the Rewind Spring while he and the goddesses learn of Hades's true plan. However, upon arriving to his destination, Dark Pit loses his ability to fly when what remained of Pandora emerges from him and uses the Rewind Spring to regain her true physical form. After defeating Pandora, Dark Pit uses the waters to restore Pit's wings, then attempts to fly away but fails, causing Viridi to step in and save him. During the first showdown with Hades, Dark Pit senses Pit is in danger, and once again borrows the Lightning Chariot. After viewing the explosion of Hades's Heart, he sends the chariot bursting through Hades's chest and rescues Pit. Before Hades can capture them, Palutena extracts them and the Lightning Chariot in the nick of time. After Pit defeats Hades, Palutena grants Dark Pit the Power of Flight, allowing him to fly alongside Pit into the sunset.Together Mode  Dark Pit also appears in the Light vs. Dark multiplayer mode, in which a Fighter on the Dark Team will respawn as him once that team's health gauge reaches zero. Should Dark Pit be the one to deal the finishing blow on the Light Team's angel (Pit), he will help him to his feet at the end of the battle, signifying an amicable relationship between the two teams.Super Smash Bros. Series Super Smash Bros. for 3DS/Wii U  Dark Pit appears as an unlockable newcomer. Here he uses the Silver Bow, Electroshock Arm, and Guardian Orbitars as his Special attacks. In Dark Pit's Palutena's Guidance conversation, Viridi reveals that he has joined the Forces of Nature after the events of Uprising due to their interests being similar.Super Smash Bros. Ultimate  Dark Pit returns in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate as a playable character, serving as an unlockable character just as he did in the previous installment. Though he seems to have no differences for his moveset, he is now classified as an Echo Fighter.Other Appearances Super Mario Maker  Alongside Pit and Palutena, Dark Pit makes an appearance as an unlockable costume in Super Mario Maker. To unlock him, the player must clear the 100 Mario Challenge on Normal or higher, or scan their Dark Pit amiibo.Yoshi's Woolly World  By scanning the Dark Pit amiibo to their game, the player can obtain a Dark Pit costume for Yoshi in Yoshi's Woolly World.Idol Descriptions Dark Pit  A flawed clone of Pit created by the Mirror of Truth. He has most of Pit's strengths, and he can even fly with Pandora's powers. While he sees Pit as a rival, the two share a strange, inherent connection.Dark Pit (Flying)  Being Pit's copy, Dark Pit was originally incapable of flight. However, he gains the ability when he absorbs Pandora's remaining power into his wings. And while he may not need help flying, he still shares a bond with his counterpart.Trivia Palutena  Palutena, also known as \"Lady Palutena,\" is the Goddess of Light, rightful ruler of Angel Land, and patron deity to Pit. She is kindhearted and benevolent, as opposed to the cruel and malevolent Medusa. She serves as the leader of her army, and while she never physically aids Pit on the battlefield, she does everything in her power to support him from the sidelines. She is voiced by Ali Hillis in the English version of Kid Icarus: Uprising, by Brandy Kopp in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U, and by Aya Hisakawa in the Japanese version of both games.Characteristics Physical Appearance  In the original Kid Icarus, Palutena wears a light blue dress with yellow trim, with blue arm cuffs and yellow slippers to match. In addition, she also possesses a blue crown decorated with red gems, a necklace, a staff in her right hand, and a large mirror shield in her left. In Of Myths and Monsters, she wears a more simplistic white gown with a tiara that matches the hairband holding up her ponytail. In both the Super Smash Bros. series and Uprising, Palutena has the appearance of a 22-year-old human woman, with long green hair that reaches down to her lower legs. She stands at around 5'9\" (176 cm), and has an overall elegant and regal appearance, fitting her title as the Goddess of Light. Her main outfit is a relatively simple-looking white dress with numerous gold ornaments to accommodate it. Interestingly, many aspects of Palutena's Uprising design parallel Pit's, including the gold laurel crown, golden fibula with a red jewel in the center, vine-like patterns on the hem of her dress, brown-colored footwear, and various gold accessories. She is typically depicted wielding a gold staff with a blue handle and a mirror shield.Personality  Palutena's personality is not explored much during the original Kid Icarus and in Kid Icarus: Of Myths and Monsters, although the general description is that she's a \"pure-hearted and kind\" goddess who puts her people before her own welfare. Depicted as kind and wise, she is shown to care much about the human race and her personal army, and will go to great lengths keep them safe from harm. Despite her mature appearance, she has been shown to possess a playful and mischievous side. Palutena often teases Pit, and even purposely places him in dangerous situations in order to complete his missions. She also has a habit of saying common phrases incorrectly and using complex vocabulary that confuses Pit. Despite this, she gets along swimmingly with the angel and banters with him throughout their adventure. She is shown to be intelligent and knowledgeable, as she helps Pit identify weak points for his foes, and gives him hints for overcoming obstacles. In fact, her information is so useful to Pit that Hades sometimes calls her \"Professor Palutena\" or \"Know-It-All Palutena\" during the events of Kid Icarus: Uprising.Relationships Pit  Palutena trusts Pit, who is thoroughly loyal and dependable in return. They share a mutually beneficial relationship: Pit does the leg-work and Palutena guides and aids him in battle. At the beginning of Uprising, it can be summarized that she has a tendency to take Pit for granted at times. She very well could have obliterated Pit with her \"Palutena Glamblaster/Super Goddess Clobberlaser\" when using it to destroy Hewdraw, knowing that he was within the destructive vicinity of the attack, and she thinks nothing of using her \"Monster Pheromones\" to attract monsters to Pit's location, potentially risking his life as both Hewdraw heads were on the loose. However, during Chapter 22, Palutena acknowledges that Pit has made countless sacrifices, both for her and everyone else, revealing that she shares a much deeper bond with him than she lets on. In Chapters 20 and 21, she's overjoyed to see Pit who, in return, is relieved to see she's all right. When Pit is unconscious at the end of Chapter 21, Palutena is understandably distraught as she holds him, highlighting just how much she cares for him. Similarly, during Chapter 15, she mentions that she \"wouldn't know what she'd do without Pit,\" causing Pit to remark how nice the statement is, whilst Hades and Viridi act sickened by the display. In response, Palutena simply tells them that they \"wouldn't know anything about loyalty or devotion.\"The Centurions  The Centurions are completely devoted to Palutena and will follow any order, even attacking Pit when she is under the Chaos Kin's control during Chapters 18 and 20. They are willing to risk their lives to protect Palutena, which causes the goddess to only send them into battle when it is absolutely necessary.Medusa  Medusa harbors a deep hatred for both Palutena and Pit, and aims to completely obliterate them for her defeat 25 years prior to the events of Uprising. While Palutena does not appear to possess the same level of hatred for Medusa, she still resents Medusa's actions against humanity. Their feud sets the events for the first Kid Icarus.Hades  The Master of the Underworld comes across as quite flamboyant, and his flirty attitude towards the goddesses appears to disgust, or at least annoy, Palutena. The goddess tolerates him during the Aurum Invasion, but makes no bones about his defeat when he is revealed to be devouring souls. Hades's attitude towards her, beyond the occasional flirting, isn't known, and he seems indifferent so long as the Goddess of Light doesn't meddle in his affairs. He often refers to her as \"Pretty Palutena\" or \"Professor Palutena\" to tease and annoy her.Viridi  Viridi has a grudging respect for Palutena\u2014revealed mostly during Chapters 20 and 21\u2014whereas Palutena seems to respect Viridi as a goddess but is equally against her actions. During the Forces of Nature arc, Palutena clearly states that Viridi is over-stepping her domain and will pay for her actions. When not at odds over humanity, Palutena and Viridi appear to be on civil terms. Palutena's respect for her seems to grow during Chapter 22 when she realizes that Viridi was there for Pit while she was being controlled by the Chaos Kin. Palutena is also aware of Viridi's soft spot for Pit and teases her about it in Chapter 16.Dark Pit  Fondly referring to Dark Pit as \"Pittoo\" and \"quite the little scrapper,\" Palutena initially mentions that his existence is unnatural and he needs to be eliminated. However, Palutena seems to become more tolerant of Dark Pit and even acknowledges how having two angels is useful as opposed to just one. Palutena and Dark Pit begrudgingly set aside their differences to assist Pit in Chapter 22 when he's on the verge of dying, showing them to be civil towards one another should the need arise. They later save Pit from Hades's Belly, and Palutena is the one who grants Dark Pit the Power of Flight in the game's ending, as Viridi had granted hers to Pit.Phosphora  Palutena at first seems to respect Phosphora's battle prowess, but she quickly turns antagonistic towards Phosphora when Phosphora offhandedly refers to her as \"Ma'am.\" Palutena becomes unusually prickly, and defensively asks Phosphora if she's \"trying to start something.\" Phosphora, on the other hand, doesn't really seem to care about Palutena at all, making the bitter feelings between them mostly one-sided.Powers and Abilities Power of Flight  Palutena's primary abilities shown in the games are utilitarian, such as granting Pit the Power of Flight. She can only grant Pit this power for five minutes at a time, limited by the angel's tolerance of the ability.Power to Transform Others  Palutena has demonstrated the ability to transform people into entirely new forms. In the original Kid Icarus, she used this power to transform Medusa into a monstrous cyclops due to her crimes against humanity prior to the events of the game. In Chapter 20 of Kid Icarus: Uprising, Viridi reveals that Palutena, possessed by the Chaos Kin, placed Pit's soul in a ring during the three year time period between Chapters 17 and 18.Battle  While she mostly acts as a supporting character, Palutena is shown to be quite adept offensively as well, possessing a wide range of unique skills that she is able to utilize in battle. Most notably, Palutena serves as the boss of Chapter 20 in Uprising, forced to fight against Pit while under the control of the Chaos Kin. Players must take care to destroy the Chaos Kin while minimizing damage to Palutena herself, as defeating her will result in a game over.Powers in the Kid Icarus 3D Anime  In Palutena's Revolting Dinner, Palutena inadvertently turns vegetables into sentient beings through an overdose of a potion she made. Later, she uses her \"Power of Caging\" to try to stop the mutant carrots. After she learns that the potion can be washed off with water, she uses her \"Power of Maelstrom\" to make it rain.Other Powers  In Uprising, Palutena grants Pit grind rails, food, and vehicles to aid him in his quest. She is also responsible for arrows that guide Pit through levels, and can expose weak spots on enemies such as Aurum ships (which she calls her \"Power of Weak-Point Exposure\"). She also mentions in one of the flight paths in Chapter 10 that her \"Power of Cooling\" keeps Pit from burning to a crisp because of the lava. If Pit fails to finish Hewdraw off in time during Chapter 3's air battle, Palutena also demonstrates a powerful attack in the form of her \"Palutena Glam Blaster\" (also referred to as a \"Sacred Goddess Clobberlaser\"), which she uses to kill it in one shot.Appearances Kid Icarus  Prior to the events of the original Kid Icarus, Palutena banished the cruel Medusa and turned her into a horrible, cycloptic monster. When Medusa takes over Skyworld and imprisons Palutena, Palutena uses the last of her energy to entrust Pit with a sacred bow, which the angel uses to break out of his prison in the Underworld. Pit takes this bow with him on his journey back to the Palace in the Sky, gathering the Three Sacred Treasures along the way and using them to defeat Medusa.Kid Icarus: Of Myths and Monsters  After Palutena experiences a nightmare that foretells the destruction of Angel Land, she summons Pit to begin training so that he may wield the Three Sacred Treasures and defend their realm. Once Pit has defeated all three fortress guardians, Palutena will grant him the sacred treasures\u2014however, Orcos appears and promptly turns the goddess of light to stone, challenging Pit to a battle in order to free her. Upon Orcos's defeat, Palutena will be restored, and she praises Pit for bringing peace back to their realm.Kid Icarus: Uprising  Palutena acts as the \"mission control\" for Pit, offering him information and suggestions about nearly everything that he comes across. With this, her personality comes out a lot more than in previous games. She appears to enjoy teasing Pit, who seems to take it in good humor. In the aftermath of the Aurum invasion, Palutena is possessed by the Chaos Kin, who uses her body to seal Pit's soul away in a ring and attack humanity for the next three years. While under the Chaos Kin's control, she acts completely differently than her usual self, becoming cold and cruel towards Pit and the humans she swore to protect. After Pit confronts and engages Palutena in battle, he manages to break her free of the Chaos Kin's control; however, this victory is short-lived when the Chaos Kin rips her soul from her body, causing her to turn to stone while the creature flees into the Chaos Vortex. Pit pursues the Chaos Kin and, with Dark Pit's help, defeats it and retrieves Palutena's soul. Shortly after her soul is returned, the remains of the Chaos Kin drag Dark Pit down into the depths of the Chaos Vortex, forcing Pit to make a split-second decision to over-exert the Power of Flight and sacrifice his own wings in order to save him. With Pit mortally wounded, Palutena assists Dark Pit in bringing Pit's body to the Rewind Spring so that they can restore his wings to their former state.Super Smash Bros. Series Super Smash Bros. Brawl  Palutena appears in The Subspace Emissary, Brawl's extensive Adventure Mode, where she gives Pit a new bow in order to fight the Subspace Army, having the honor of being the only non-playable ally character in the story. She also appears in the background of Pit's Final Smash, Palutena's Army. She's even featured as a collectible trophy, only given once the player has completed the \"Cleaning house in Skyworld\" event.Trophy Description  The ruling goddess of Angel Land. Palutena showered the earth with rays of light, using her powers for the good of mankind. But Medusa, who in her hate for mankind was banished to the underworld, makes war on Palutena and wins, capturing and holding the goddess deep within a temple. Palutena entrusts Pit with a sacred bow and the task of defeating Medusa.Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U  At E3 2014, Palutena was announced to be a playable character in the fourth and fifth installment of the Super Smash Bros. franchise. Barring the Mii Fighter, she is the only playable fighter to have three completely unique customization options for all four of her special attacks. Palutena also appears in the easter egg feature Palutena's Guidance, where she discusses strategies for the various different fighters alongside Pit and Viridi.Super Smash Bros. Ultimate  Palutena returns in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate as a playable character, though she is no longer available from the start. Her moveset generally appears to be the same as it was in the previous installment, only now her alternate Specials have been \"stream-lined.\" All the changes are currently unknown, but now her down Special functions as both a deflector as well as a counter depending on circumstance.Other Appearances Kid Icarus 3D Anime  Palutena appears as one of the main protagonists in Thanatos Rising, where she assists Pit in trying to defeat Thanatos. Her first action is to warn Pit of Thanatos's imminent attack on a nearby city. Later, when giving chase to Thanatos, Palutena grants Pit the Power of Flight to catch up. When Pit loses track of him, Palutena suggests a shortcut through a nearby valley. As she guides him through, Pit asks if she's sure about this. After teasing him about his lack of faith, Palutena continues to guide him despite being \"rusty.\" Palutena also serves as the main character in her own two-episode animated short, Palutena's Revolting Dinner. Here, she attempts to make dinner for herself and Pit but accidentally brings the ingredients she's using to life in the process, causing them to sprout limbs. They quickly go on a rampage, forcing her to summon rain to eventually defeat their combined, giant form. In the end, Palutena tells Pit that they will be going out to dinner instead. During Medusa's Revenge, Palutena reveals her history with the Goddess of Darkness, but does not play an overly major role beyond confronting Medusa when she attacks the humans.Super Mario Maker  Alongside Pit and Dark Pit, Palutena makes an appearance as an unlockable costume in Super Mario Maker. To unlock her, the player must clear the 100 Mario Challenge on Normal or higher, or scan their Palutena amiibo.Yoshi's Woolly World  By scanning the Palutena amiibo to their game, the player can obtain a Palutena costume for Yoshi in Yoshi's Woolly World.WarioWare Gold  If the player scans the Palutena amiibo to their game, Wario will paint a crudely drawn portrait of her.Idol Descriptions Palutena  The goddess of light and ruler of Skyworld. Palutena guides Pit through most of his journey, using her powers to help him protect the humans of the surface world from her archnemesis, Medusa, goddess of the Underworld.Chaos Kin and Palutena  The Chaos Kin binds Palutena to its will, manipulating her form like a foul puppet. By doing so, the Chaos Kin simultaneously shields itself and forces Pit to attack the very goddess he serves.Petrified Palutena  After Pit defeats the possessed Palutena, the Chaos Kin is unable to escape with the goddess. She turns her body to stone at the last moment, so the Chaos Kin can flee into the Chaos Vortex with only her soul.Palutena (Rare)  Despite her reputation for wisdom and mercy, little is known about the history and motivations behind the goddess Palutena. What she lacks in military might, she makes up for in her brave champion, Pit.Trivia Pit  Pit is the protagonist of the Kid Icarus series. He first appeared in Kid Icarus for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1986, followed by an appearance in Kid Icarus: Of Myths and Monsters for the Game Boy in 1991. Other than a handful of cameos, Pit didn't make another major appearance until the release of Super Smash Bros. Brawl in 2008, and again in the 2012 Nintendo 3DS title Kid Icarus: Uprising. Pit is Palutena's most loyal servant, as well as the captain of her royal bodyguards. He is sometimes erroneously referred to as \"Kid Icarus\" due to confusing his name with the English title of the series. He is voiced by Antony Del Rio in the English version of Uprising and Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U, Troy Lund in the E3 2010 trailer and early demos for Uprising, Lani Minella in Brawl, and Minami Takayama in the Japanese version of both games.Characteristics Physical Appearance  In the original Kid Icarus, Pit appears as a young, Putto-like angel wearing a simple, white chiton, and a pair of sandals and metal cuffs. He has short, brown hair and white wings that are incapable of flight. Starting in Of Myths and Monsters, he now possesses blue eyes and a laurel crown. Pit was given a significant redesign by Masahiro Sakurai in Brawl, which was approved by Pit's creator and inspired by the evolution of Link's design over the years. Pit now looks to be roughly 13 years of age and stands at 5'3\" (160 cm). He has large, blue eyes and fluffy, brown hair, with a small cowlick poking out from the back. His chiton is now decorated with red and gold hems along the bottom, which is fastened on the shoulder by a golden fibula with a red gem in the center. He wears the outfit with a brown belt lined with silver and a gold, triangular buckle on his waist. Pit also wears navy blue tights beneath his chiton. The angel now has a pair of bronze and gold cuffs around his forearms, and singular gold rings on his upper left arm and right thigh. His brown sandals are decorated with crossing beige bands, and are edged at the top with white wool.Personality  Pit is peppy and chipper, and like many Nintendo protagonists, he is fearless and heroic. He has no problem fighting against monsters many times his size and is always ready to help the humans when they are in need. The angel has a notable humorous side and enjoys cracking jokes and bantering with Palutena. Pit is also very confident, which makes him bit of a show-off at times. He can, however, become a little reckless due to his gung-ho and naive personality, which causes him to get into trouble at times. Nonetheless, Pit is a good-hearted and friendly character. He is described by Viridi\u00a0as \"insufferably upbeat\" and by Dark Pit\u00a0as \"annoyingly cheerful.\" He is also shown to be moderately gullible at times, often believing Palutena's words to be true even when she is joking. His trust in Palutena is absolute, but he is shown to be somewhat nervous on his own, such as during the ascent of the Lightning Tower. Without Palutena to back him up, he steadily becomes quieter and quieter. While in Hades's body, Pit also tries to replicate Palutena's helpful dialogue as she can't contact him. He becomes very self-conscious doing this, but it helps to reassure him.Abilities  Despite being a flightless angel, Pit is still a skilled and versatile fighter. He originally started out as an archer that mainly specialized in using the Bow, but over the years he has become more experienced with using various weapons, such as the Blade, Claws, and Cannon. He has a very high level of durability, as his body was capable of taking Magnus's powerful blows and attacks. In Uprising, Pit mentions that he's \"spent this entire game getting shot at,\" showcasing his durability against the Underworld Army and the like. Also, as the Captain of Palutena's Guard, he has demonstrated good leadership skills. Despite Pit's extreme dependence and trust in Palutena, he's capable of coming up with ideas and strategies on his own, as shown from battling Hades's Heart or when battling Pseudo-Palutena when the real Palutena was asleep.Appearances Kid Icarus  In the original Kid Icarus, Pit begins as a young angel boy trapped in the Underworld. Palutena, the Goddess of Light, has been imprisoned, so she entrusts Pit with a magical bow and the duty of gathering the Three Sacred Treasures, defeating the Dark Goddess Medusa, and saving Angel Land. Pit must journey through the Underworld, Overworld, Skyworld, and finally, the Palace in the Sky in order to gather the Three Sacred Treasures and free Palutena.Kid Icarus: Of Myths and Monsters  In Kid Icarus: Of Myths and Monsters, Pit is charged with training for the defense of Angel Land, after Palutena foresees an invasion of demons led by a monster called Orcos. The training involves the Three Sacred Treasures, which Pit must unite. However, because of a dire emergency, Palutena had entrusted the Three Sacred Treasures to the fortress guardians. To prevent Orcos's invasion, Pit must once again obtain the Three Sacred Treasures. After defeating Orcos, Pit ends up losing his wings when he flies too close to the sun.Kid Icarus: Uprising Solo Mode  25 years after Pit restored peace to Skyworld, Medusa has been resurrected and resumes her quest for revenge. She begins by sending her troops to attack That First Town, prompting Palutena to send Pit in to help the humans. When he flies overhead, the local residents cheer for the return of the goddess, much to Pit's delight. He then lands inside the town, where he takes on and defeats the Underworld's watchdog, Twinbellows. Afterwards, Medusa appears before him, prompting Pit to proclaim his plans to defeat her before he is teleported away by Palutena. The humans soon discover that the Underworld forces are originating from a dreary castle, causing them to send in their own troops to retaliate. Palutena foresees disaster and sends Pit down to the surface to help, where he stumbles across Magnus, a human warrior who is fighting off Underworld troops by himself. Pit and Magnus introduce themselves to each other, and after realizing they have similar goals, decide to work together to defeat the dark lord. The two travel through the castle and arrive at the throne room, where they fight and defeat Dark Lord Gaol. Afterwards, Gaol's armor falls apart, revealing her to be a human. This upsets Pit, but Palutena assures him that she is still alive before teleporting him away. In retaliation for Gaol's defeat, Medusa sends her troops to attack Skyworld directly. Palutena hastily sends Pit out to defend their home\u2014however, the amount of Underworld troops is overwhelming, forcing Pit to head straight for their commander, Hewdraw. Pit engages in a brief Air Battle with the beast, severing its heads one by one. Unfortunately, Palutena informs him that Hewdraw heads can live without their body, leading Pit to head to That Burning Town in pursuit. With the local residents going into hiding, Pit is given free rein as he traverses the town and takes down Underworld troops along the way. Palutena tells him to head to a nearby courtyard, promising to grant him a present in return\u2014however, once Pit arrives, he finds that the gift is being doused with monster pheromones in order to lure in one of the Hewdraw heads. The angel promptly defeats it and moves on, finding that the remaining head has already formed a new body at a nearby lake. He confronts it and finally defeats Hewdraw for good, and Palutena teleports him away shortly after. In search of one of Medusa's commanders, Palutena sends Pit to the Reaper Fortress in order to identify the force that is hiding the Labyrinth of Deceit. However, Pit has difficulty getting through when he discovers that hoards of Reapers guard the fortress. To work around it, Palutena guides Pit into a nearby ravine, and while it is packed with many Underworld troops, he manages to safely infiltrate the fortress. After traveling through the structure, Pit finally encounters a room with a single Reaper, which notices him and transforms into the Great Reaper. Pit engages it in battle, and Palutena figures out that the Great Reaper is the force that was hiding the labyrinth's location. Upon the Great Reaper's defeat, Pit tells Palutena that he's enjoyed their time together thus far, to which Palutena teases him about his lack of friends before teleporting him away. Having found the location of one of Medusa's commanders, Palutena sends Pit into a space pocket in order to reach the Labyrinth of Deceit. On the way, the flight path is twisted and distorted, making navigation tedious. With time, Pit and Palutena successfully infiltrate the labyrinth and meet the goddess of calamity, Pandora. After traveling through the confusing maze while discussing how the Mirror of Truth can duplicate troops in the Underworld Army, they finally reach Pandora's room. Pit confronts her with an elaborate sequence in which he poses and declares that he will defeat her, and the two engage in battle shortly after. However, the battle ends prematurely when Pandora decides to give up the Mirror of Truth, to which Pit promptly destroys it. In doing so, the Mirror of Truth duplicates Pit, which brings about the creation of Dark Pit. As Pandora introduces the clone, Dark Pit turns against her and fights her alongside Pit. After her defeat, Dark Pit kicks Pit in the stomach in retaliation for \"ripping off his look,\" then uses what remains of Pandora's powers to grant himself limitless flight. Dark Pit flies off, prompting Palutena to extract Pit in order to pursue him. Pit heads out and immediately engages in a small battle with Dark Pit the moment he enters the sky. The two stop and Dark Pit begins flying away, causing Pit to follow him. Pit questions whether he's with the Underworld Army, but Dark Pit insists that he only opposes Pit for \"copying his act.\" They argue about this while flying and against one another until Medusa appears, attempting to recruit Dark Pit. The angel rudely declines, giving Pit hope that he won't have to continue fighting him. However, due to Dark Pit's destructive nature, Palutena concludes that he is still the enemy, forcing Pit to continue with his pursuit. Now trailing behind Dark Pit, Pit flies down to the Temple Ruins to chase his clone on land. Here, Pit follows Underworld troops to lead him in the direction of Dark Pit, engaging him in battle twice before finally chasing him to the top, where they fight and argue once again. Upon his defeat, Dark Pit claims to have gone easy on Pit before flying off. Pit attempts to go after him, but Palutena states that they should refocus their efforts on Medusa before teleporting him away. Deciding to forget about Dark Pit for the time being, Palutena sends Pit out to a desert to track down Thanatos, one of Medusa's commanders who possesses the Underworld Key. They arrive at a nearby ocean, which Palutena supposedly splits in two, much to Pit's amazement. He then heads through the split and meets Poseidon, who reprimands Palutena for taking responsibility for the parting of his ocean. After discussing various aspects of the Underworld Army and humanity, Pit arrives at the Seafloor Palace. He makes his way through the structure and arrives at Thanatos's room, where they engage in battle. After his defeat, Thanatos disappears and leaves behind the Underworld Key, leaving Pit to grab it before being extracted from the palace. Pit heads out expecting to challenge Medusa, but Palutena informs him that a gang of Space Pirates have stolen the Three Sacred Treasures. As such, she sends him into the Galactic Sea, where he locates and infiltrates the Space Pirate Ship. He searches throughout the interior with no luck, only to find the Space Pirate Captain in possession of the Three Sacred Treasures Case on the ship's deck. Before Pit can take action, a giant space kraken suddenly emerges and eats the captain, then notices Pit and engages him in battle. After its defeat, Pit obtains the case containing the treasures and is teleported away by Palutena. Now equipped with the Three Sacred Treasures, Pit flies through stormy skies and into a ravine, where he uses the Underworld Key to travel through a portal to the Underworld. Once there, Pit spots Dark Pit, who flies off to fight Underworld troops while Pit engages in a battle with the Underworld Gatekeeper. As Pit struggles to defeat it, Dark Pit swoops in and deals the finishing blow, then orders him to proceed before reinforcements arrive. Pit heeds his advice and flies into the Underworld Castle, where he fights fake versions of Twinbellows, Hewdraw, and Pandora created by Medusa in order to stop him. He eventually moves onto the goddess of darkness herself, to which he gives a speech about her defeat before engaging her in battle. After a long and tedious fight, Pit emerges victorious and celebrates his victory with Palutena while credits begin rolling. However, a mysterious voice interrupts and rips through the screen, revealing himself to be Hades, the true ruler of the Underworld. As Pit and Palutena reel from this revelation, he informs them that he was responsible for the resurrection of Medusa, proclaiming himself to be even more powerful than she was before bidding them farewell. With an even more powerful enemy to focus on, Palutena sends Pit out toward a volcano where Underworld troops have gathered. The goddess informs him that an object known as the Wish Seed is located there, and is likely the reason for the Underworld's appearance. Pit considers using the Wish Seed in order to grant himself the ability to fly, though Palutena quickly brushes this aside and flies him down to Phoenix Mountain, where they discuss defeating the Wish Seed's guardian, the Phoenix. Along the way, Palutena discovers that the Wish Seed is fake and the story was used by Hades to cause destruction. However, she tells Pit to proceed with the mission and defeat the Phoenix regardless, as the Phoenix would be a threat to humanity if the Underworld Army sets it free. With that in mind, Pit swiftly defeats the Phoenix, though its defeat leaves a large beacon in its wake, alerting the humans of its absence and leading them to believe the Wish Seed has been taken. Foreseeing major bloodshed, Palutena promptly teleports Pit out of the mountain. As Pit flies through the gates of the temple, Palutena informs him that the humans have fallen for Hades's hoax and have waged war amongst each other because of it. Pit begins fighting off Underworld troops that gathered nearby to collect souls, but he is quickly interrupted when a bright light shines in the distance and Palutena suddenly pulls him out of the area. A large object crashes into the earth and explodes, followed by an unfamiliar voice, which quickly reveals itself to be Viridi, goddess of nature. As she explains her goals to wipe out humanity and the functionality of her Reset Bombs, Pit and Palutena begin to argue with her. Realizing they won't be able to see eye to eye, Palutena sends Pit inside the newly formed Reset Bomb Forest, where he fights off Forces of Nature troops and frees humans from the brambles within. After traveling through the forest, Pit faces and defeats one of Viridi's commanders, Cragalanche. The goddess of nature then warns Pit of another Reset Bomb before disappearing, and Palutena transports him back to figure out a plan. While Viridi and Hades become distracted in their own feud, Palutena sends Pit through the skies to destroy another Reset Bomb. Once that task is complete, she sends him into the Reset Bomb Depot in order to stop all of the destruction at its source. While the deities all argue amongst themselves, Pit heads into the center of the depot, where he effectively destroys the structure's core before making his escape. Afterwards, Palutena informs Pit of their next target: Arlon, another one of Viridi's commanders. In order to reach him, Pit infiltrates the Lunar Sanctum, a base in the sky disguised as the moon. Once inside, Pit takes on various Forces of Nature foes\u2014including fake holograms\u2014before running into Dark Pit. Having been persuaded by Arlon to defend the fortress, the dark angel engages him in battle, though Pit comes out victorious. Pit then confronts and defeats Arlon, causing the Lunar Sanctum to collapse and an unknown creature to escape while Palutena teleports him away. With the Forces of Nature and Underworld still at war with each other, Palutena takes advantage of their battle to send Pit in to defeat Viridi's weakened commander, Phosphora. He arrives at the Thunder Cloud Temple, where he is instructed to cut off various power supplies throughout the area. Once he reaches the center, he defeats Phosphora in battle, and Palutena teleports him away as the temple collapses. Early in the morning, Palutena urges Pit out into the sky with the appearance of a new threat\u2014a mysterious, alien-like race known as the Aurum. Hades and Viridi put their war on hold as they observe these new lifeforms, and all the gods decide to temporarily call a truce in order to retaliate. Another new figure, Pyrrhon, arrives on the scene to fill them in on the details of their foes, then decides to work together with Pit to fend them off. Pit is sent down to one of the Aurum Islands afterward, where he locates and destroys the Aurum Core. For their next mission, Pit is tasked with infiltrating the Aurum Hive in order to weaken the Aurum further. However, they soon find that there is no entrance, forcing Hades to crash an Aurum Battleship into the structure to give Pit a makeshift path through. Once inside, Pit fights his way to the Aurum Generator\u2014however, Pyrrhon attempts to assist Pit by shooting it with his power, which only makes it more powerful. Despite this setback, Pit manages to defeat the generator and is escorted away. Raring to defeat the Aurum once and for all, Pit and the gods set out to destroy the Aurum Brain. Everything goes exactly as planned, but when Pit encounters the brain itself, Pyrrhon suddenly interrupts by flying into the object's center. Having merged with the brain, the sun god declares his authority over the Aurum, commanding them to attack the angel\u2014and to make matters worse, Pyrrhon blocks Palutena's divine powers to extract him. Forced to cut off the Power of Flight prematurely, Pit plummets through the sky, only to land on a platform sent in by Viridi. He proceeds with the help of the Forces of Nature, though it isn't long before her troops are killed off. Palutena sends in her own troops to help Pit, allowing him to progress into the Aurum Brain Fortress. There he finds that Pyrrhon is behaving strangely, revealing that the Aurum Brain has overtaken the sun god. Pit is forced to defeat his possessed comrade, who then uses his power to launch himself and his army back into space. In the wake of the Aurum invasion, Pit suddenly finds himself awakening from a long slumber, confused regarding his whereabouts. Noticing a ring in his field of vision, he attempts to communicate with Palutena, only for a young girl to suddenly grab the ring. Realizing that he currently resides within the ring, the girl places the ring on her finger which gives Pit control of her movements. He uses the opportunity to investigate a nearby war-torn town, but he trips and drops the ring. The ring is then picked up in the mouth of a dog, which he uses to travel the rest of the way. As he explores, he finds Magnus fighting off centurions, much to his confusion. The man begins walking away, prompting Pit to hop onto his back and shove the ring into his face. Although hesitant, Magnus takes it and grants Pit control over his body, communicating with the angel soon after. Through this, Pit finds out that he's been absent for three years, though his body has been attacking the humans he swore to protect ever since. The two defeat Pit's Body, granting Pit control over himself once again. He calls out to Palutena, though Viridi unexpectedly grants him the Power of Flight instead. As he soars through the sky, she shows him the ruins of Skyworld, and a projection of Palutena appears to declare her new disdain for both him and the humans. Unable to confront her directly thanks to a massive force field surrounding the area, Viridi teleports him back to one of her residences. She then sends Pit out on a mission to secure a vehicle known as the Lightning Chariot, which she plans to use to destroy the force field surrounding Palutena's Temple. With the use of an Angel Cannon, Pit is launched into space, where he locates and gives chase to the aforementioned chariot. Following it down to the Lightning Chariot Base, a being known as the Chariot Master begins communicating with the group, allowing Pit the chance to ask him for temporary use of the Lightning Chariot\u2014however, he is reluctant to agree, forcing the angel to seek him out at the top of the tower. After traversing through several rooms with hoards of enemies, Pit finally arrives at a large racetrack, where he encounters the unicorn Phos with a small chariot attached. Though he thinks this is a present, the Chariot Master quickly reveals that he intends to fight him for the chariot instead. Once defeated, the Chariot Master collapses onto the ground, causing Pit to rush over with concern. Using his final moments to deem Pit worthy of the vehicle, the Chariot Master's body fades away, leaving Viridi to remark that he was an honorable warrior before extracting Pit. Now possessing the Lightning Chariot, Pit takes a warp tunnel to Palutena's Temple and successfully shatters the force field. As Pit begins traversing through the familiar grounds, he argues with Palutena over her newfound views. Afterwards, Viridi elaborates on the Chaos Kin, explaining that Palutena's change of heart is likely the result of the creature taking control of her. With stronger resolve to save her, Pit reaches the center of the temple and encounters Palutena. Devastated by her current state, Pit engages her in battle, where he must carefully attack the Chaos Kin floating nearby while avoiding harming the goddess. Once defeated, Palutena becomes free of the Chaos Kin's control, and the two reunite\u2014however, the Chaos Kin suddenly rips Palutena's soul out from her back, turning her to stone. As the Chaos Kin escapes through a portal, Pit orders Viridi to send him after it, but the portal becomes too small for Pit to cross. Just as all hope seems lost, Dark Pit suddenly crashes the Lightning Chariot into the portal, ripping it open and granting Pit access to it. Pit heads into the Chaos Vortex, where he faces many bizarre obstacles along the way\u2014including copies of himself\u2014until Viridi finally locates the Chaos Kin. He pursues it down to Chaos Island, where he is greeted with hoards of duplicated enemies. Dark Pit joins the fray to assist Pit, informing him that he was reduced to nothing when Pit was sealed inside the Ring of Chaos. Concluding that the two share a strong connection with one another, they plow through the remaining enemies until the Chaos Kin itself finally appears before them. They swiftly defeat it, and Palutena's soul returns to her body, prompting Pit to happily reunite with her once again. As Dark Pit watches this display, the Chaos Kin's ash-like remains become animate, clinging to Dark Pit and sending him off the edge. Pit rushes after him and commands Viridi to grant him flight, though she is quick to remind him that because he already used the Power of Flight earlier, using it again so soon will result in his wings burning up. Pit insists despite the consequences, and Viridi reluctantly agrees, granting him her powers in order to save his clone. Once they have been safely extracted, both angels end up collapsed on the ground, where Viridi informs Dark Pit that with the loss of his wings, Pit's condition is dire. Palutena kneels down and lifts Pit's unconscious body into her arms, reminiscing over Pit's wishes and achievements. Palutena and Dark Pit then work together to save Pit, which they can only achieve by traveling through the Underworld to reach a place known as the Rewind Spring. After an unexpected battle with a revived Pandora, Dark Pit dips Pit's wings into the healing waters of the spring, restoring his condition. Pit awakens shortly after and springs to his feet in celebration, leaving Dark Pit to run off the ledge in an attempt to fly away\u2014however, due to the absence of Pandora's powers in his wings, he falls instead, prompting Viridi to teleport him away. Left to themselves, Pit turns to the sky and happily calls out to Palutena, expressing how much he missed her. She admits that she missed him as well before teleporting him away. Having recovered from his injuries, Pit equips the Three Sacred Treasures once again and heads through the Underworld to confront Hades. As he's sent down a ravine, Pit questions the location of Hades's castle, to which the goddess informs him that he resides anywhere he pleases within his realm. Hades then appears before Pit, where he swiftly strips him of the treasures before sucking him into his mouth. Now trapped inside a different dimension within Hades's belly, Pit traverses upwards through gelatinous structures until he encounters Hades's Heart. Upon defeat, the heart explodes and sends Pit flying\u2014however, Dark Pit suddenly zips by in the Lightning Chariot, grabbing Pit out of the air and bursting out of Hades's chest. The dark angel tells Pit that the explosion alerted him to his location, causing Pit to express his relief while Palutena welcomes him back. Hades reaches out and attempts to capture the chariot in his hand, but the goddess of light quickly extracts them from the realm. In search of a replacement for the Three Sacred Treasures, Palutena sends Pit out to meet Dyntos, the god of the forge. Though Pit believes Dyntos is already on their side, Palutena informs him that the god must be persuaded first. To do so, Pit must complete three trials: the first being to defeat replicas of the Phoenix, Cragalanche, and the Kraken, the second being to defeat Magnus, Gaol, and Pseudo-Palutena, and the third being a battle with the Great Sacred Treasure itself. Once the treasure has been defeated, Pit begins piloting it and eagerly zips across the skies. As Palutena and Dyntos converse amongst themselves, Pit crashes the mech into the ground, prompting Palutena to teleport him away. Now armed with the Great Sacred Treasure, Pit soars through Underworld skies to face off against Hades under the watchful eyes of Palutena and Viridi. Hades suddenly bursts out from the ground soon after, confronting Pit and initiating the first part of a long, strenuous battle. During the fight, the Great Sacred Treasure changes its form while Pit gives chase to Hades through a portal to the Overworld. Here, the lord of the Underworld destroys the mech with one vicious clap, leaving Pit at a major disadvantage\u2014however, Medusa suddenly appears and attacks Hades in an effort to overthrow him. Hades quickly destroys her, but her brief appearance grants Pit the opportunity to grab the remaining cannon of the Great Sacred Treasure as Viridi grants him the Power of Flight. While Palutena charges up the cannon, Pit tells Hades that he stands for all living creatures, departed souls, and Palutena, wishing to defeat Hades in their honor. He then fires the cannon and destroys his adversary once and for all, striking a pose to signify his victory. The residents of a nearby town begin to cheer as Pit flies happily through the air, though Viridi is quick to argue with him over her lingering issues regarding humanity. Palutena steps in to counter her arguments, and Dark Pit appears soon after to fly off into the sunset with his lookalike as the credits begin to roll.Together Mode  Pit also appears in the Light vs. Dark multiplayer mode, in which a Fighter on the Light Team will respawn as him once that team's health gauge reaches zero. Should Pit be the one to deal the finishing blow on the Dark Team's angel (Dark Pit), he will help him to his feet at the end of the battle, signifying an amicable relationship between the two teams.Kid Icarus 3D Anime  In Thanatos Rising, Pit is tasked with a mission to stop Thanatos, who is headed for a human city with a hijacked Trojan Horse. Right as Thanatos attempts to fire massive boulders at the humans, Pit intervenes, chasing the god into the wooden interior of his vehicle. There, the two engage in a brief battle before Pit purposely fires at a gear located above Thanatos, which sends it falling and causes the structure to collapse, ultimately saving the human city nearby. In Medusa's Revenge, a young Pit appears as Palutena explains the events of the original Kid Icarus. Palutena then sends out an older Pit into enemy-infested skies, where he confronts Medusa. In Palutena's Revolting Dinner, Pit complains to Palutena about the abundance of vegetables in their recent meals. Though he suggests alternatives, Palutena's decision becomes final when she asks Pit to retrieve tomatoes for her Vegetable Surprise. As Palutena deals with unruly animated carrots, Pit contacts her telepathically, noting his retrieval of the tomatoes as well as how hungry he is. Not wishing for Pit to see her struggling with her dinner, Palutena distracts him with a request for squash, to which he obliges. On his trip back to the temple, Pit witnesses a massive explosion from within the structure, causing him to drop his vegetables in shock. Shortly afterwards, Pit is shown commanding Palutena's troops to catch the revolting carrots. Other vegetables soon join the fray and combine together to form a massive vegetable monster, which Palutena eventually disintegrates with water\u2014however, a group of giant gourd monsters ambush her, which causes the pair of Wolf Claws she had equipped to explode and alert Pit to her location. As Pit and the Centurions rush inside to investigate, they spot Palutena standing among the rubble, appearing incredibly frazzled with a gourd over her head. Once the gourd falls apart, she regains her composure and curtly tells Pit that they will be going out for dinner instead.Super Smash Bros. Series Super Smash Bros.

It features Pit, the main protagonist of the series, on his quest to defeat Medusa and restore peace to Angel Land. In 2012, Nintendo released the 3D Classics: Kid Icarus remake for the Nintendo 3DS through the Nintendo eShop. The remake features more vibrant graphics and enabled stereoscopic 3D graphics. Kid Icarus has spawned two handheld sequels, Kid Icarus: Of Myths and Monsters and Kid Icarus: Uprising.Blurb  Get ready for the action and adventure of Greek Mythology translated to the Video Age. Far away in a kingdom called \"Angel Land\", the evil goddess Medusa has stolen the Three Sacred Treasures and imprisoned the goddess of light, Palutena. As Kid Icarus, your mission is to find the treasures, destroy Medusa and rescue Palutena from the depths of the Palace in the Sky. To find the treasures you'll travel through ruins collecting weapons and storing power for use in combat against creatures of Medusa's army. Use your bow and arrow to ward off gatekeepers of the Underworld, Overworld and Skyworld as you strive towards your battle against Medusa. Will you survive to restore Palutena's light and return it to \"Angel Land\"? Only you know.Plot  The Tale of Kid Icarus tells the events of the plot leading up to the start of the game. It is provided in the game's official manual.The Tale of Kid Icarus  \"Let us go back to the distant past to an age when the Gods and Man lived together in harmony. There was once a kingdom called \"Angel Land.\" This kingdom was ruled by two beautiful goddesses, Palutena who administered light and Medusa who ruled darkness. Palutena lived in the Palace in the Sky and administered light so that man could live in happiness. And bathed in this light man grew food and lived in peace. However, Medusa the goddess of darkness was different. Medusa hated mankind. She took great pleasure in drying up the crops that man took great pains to grow and in turning people into stone statues. In her anger Palutena changed Medusa into an ugly monster and banished her to the deep, dark Underworld. For being changed into this ugly monster and forced to live in the Underworld, Medusa promised to take over the Palace in the Sky where Palutena lived. So great was Medusa's anger that she joined forces with the monsters and evil spirits of the Underworld and Medusa's army soon began to surpass Palutena's army in strength. Soon a war between Palutena and Medusa began. Medusa led a surprise attack on Palutena's army which could barely fend off the attack. Palutena's army suffered major losses and was heavily defeated in the final battle. What's more, Medusa's army took the Three Sacred Treasures - the Mirror Shield, the Arrow of Light, and the Wings of Pegasus - away from them. Almost all of the warriors in Palutena's army were turned into stone statues and Palutena herself was imprisoned deep in the Palace of the Sky. The peaceful realm of Angel Land came to be inhabited by the foul and terrible monsters and was turned into a land of darkness ruled by the wicked Medusa. Locked in the depths of the Palace in the Sky, Palutena's strength was drained to its last. As a last resort, she sought the help of the angel youth Pit who was being held prisoner locked in a deep dungeon in the Underworld. Pit was a valiant warrior who used to be in charge of Palutena's personal bodyguards. Armed with a bow and arrow brought to him through Palutena's magical strength, Pit attempted an escape from the Underworld. The guard at this time was low in number as Medusa's army had advanced to the Palace in the Sky. Pit succeeded in his escape and set out on his long adventure to rescue Palutena. Yet to defeat Medusa he had to get the Three Sacred Treasures. Will Pit be able to restore Palutena's light and return it to Angel Land? Only you can answer that question.\"Gameplay  Kid Icarus is a side-scrolling platformer, though the last stage undergoes a genre shift and becomes a side-scrolling shooter instead. Pit's arrows have only a short range and he has a jump height of about three times his base height; despite having wings, he cannot fly naturally. He can crouch to avoid enemies and even move while crouching at the same speed. However, there are many platforms, such as ice and clouds, that Pit will fall through should he crouch while standing on them. Being damaged will result in a small amount of knockback and very brief invulnerability (less so when standing on a damage tile, such as lava). Pit can walk behind certain objects, such as pillars and plants, but this won't protect him from being damaged by an enemy. Pit starts off with one segment of health that contains 7 Hit Points. He can earn more segments, each of which contains an additional 8 HP, upon reaching certain score values: Pit can obtain three different weapons over the course of the game from Sacred Training Chambers, each of which requires a different amount of health to activate. Once obtained, the first weapon will activate when Pit reaches two segments of health, the second weapon requires three, and the third weapon needs a total of four full segments to activate. When activated, the weapons will remain active for the rest of the game, with the exception of when Pit enters a Fortress. Pit's mission will take him through four worlds, each with four stages culminating in an intimidating Fortress. Here, Pit must defeat the Gatekeeper of the Fortress and obtain the Sacred Casket. In the last area, Pit must fly through Medusa's remaining forces. After defeating Medusa, Pit will restart the game at level 1-1; however, his score, weapons, total health, strength, Hearts, and Credit Card debt all remain intact, making additional playthroughs easier. However, any password for 1-1 will override Pit's status and restart the game as though it were a new one. Therefore, players should proceed to 1-2 before acquiring the password.Rooms  Pit's quest will allow him to explore many chambers. Once Pit leaves a room it's forever sealed, with the exception of Fortress rooms. They include:Items  Pit has a variety of items at his disposal. Some are earned in Sacred Training Chambers, others discovered in Treasure Chambers, others must be bought with Hearts in a variety of Stores.Weapons  Pit's weapons do not necessarily activate when obtained; they require him to reach a certain amount of health before they'll activate automatically. Pit must reach two full segments of health to activate the first weapon he picks up. The second weapon will require three, while the third requires four.Regular Items Fortress Items  Fortress items disappear when Pit leaves the Fortress that they were found in.Recovery Items Enemies Underworld Overworld Skyworld Palace in the Sky Multiple Areas Endings  The ending that the player receives is dependent on four requirements:Differences Between Versions Trivia Medusa  Medusa (\u51a5\u754c\u5973\u738b\u30e1\u30c7\u30e5\u30fc\u30b5 Meikai Jo\u014d Medy\u016bsa, \"Underworld Queen Medusa\") is the Goddess of Darkness, and former co-ruler of Angel Land. She is the main antagonist of the original Kid Icarus, and the main antagonist of Kid Icarus: Uprising until the end of Chapter 9. She is voiced by Cree Summer in the English version of Uprising, and by Naomi Shind\u014d in the Japanese version of the game.Characteristics Physical Appearance  In the original Kid Icarus, she appears as a large, green cyclops wearing a simplistic pink dress. She has curly yellow hair with four snakes protruding from it, fangs sticking out of her mouth, and clawed hands and feet. In Uprising, Medusa appears as a humanoid woman with purple-gray skin, lavender eyes, scaly arms, and a black tattoo over her left eye. Her long, black hair has several teal snakes mixed in, with a single orange snake on the left side of her head. She wears a long, dark purple dress that blends into red at the bottom, with gold trimmings throughout and gold ornaments that match Palutena's dress. She wields a two-pronged gold and blue staff with two snakes wrapped around it.Personality  While Palutena is shown to be warm and kind, Medusa serves as a stark contrast to the Goddess of Light, being much more cold and sinister. She delights in the suffering of her enemies and shows little regard for the lives of others. Although she despises humanity, this contempt is only rivaled by her hatred for Palutena and Pit. She thirsts for revenge against anyone she perceives to have wronged her, and will stop at nothing to achieve her goals.Backstory  Prior to the events of the original Kid Icarus, Medusa and Palutena ruled Angel Land together in peace. While Palutena fostered the growth of humanity, Medusa hated their kind, causing her to dry their crops and petrify people. In a fit of anger, Palutena changed Medusa into a hideous cyclops and banished her to the Underworld. Since then, Medusa vowed to overthrow Palutena and retake her position in the Palace in the Sky.Appearances Kid Icarus  Gathering the Underworld Army under her command, Medusa led a surprise attack upon Palutena's army and took possession of the Three Sacred Treasures, giving each to her most powerful followers while imprisoning Palutena within her own palace. However, Palutena sought the assistance of Pit, a young warrior who used to be in charge of Palutena's personal body-guard who was locked in a dungeon in the Underworld at this time. Palutena used her magical prowess to arm Pit with a bow and arrow to assist him in his escape from the Underworld, enabling him to regain the Three Sacred Treasures and use them to end Medusa's reign of terror.Kid Icarus: Uprising  Though unaware of this, Medusa was resurrected by Hades when he added \"a pinch of her memories to a ton of souls,\" thus creating her new body. Regardless, Medusa reassembles the Underworld Army to attack the world and get her revenge on Pit and Palutena for her defeat twenty-five years prior. When her forces are defeated and Pit storms her domain, Medusa battles the angel and is defeated by him again after being forced to assume her true form. A false ending then rolls, which is interrupted by Hades, explaining that the entire attack was actually his doing and that he resurrected Medusa to keep Pit and Palutena busy while he put his plans into motion. During Pit's final battle with Hades, a revived Medusa appears to help Pit by attacking Hades, saving Pit before Hades can unleash his \"deadliest attack\" and destroying her arm in the process. When Palutena questions why she would help them, Medusa states that she will not play Hades's puppet anymore and attempts another attack. This time, Hades blocks her and destroys her remaining arm before promptly finishing her off for good.Kid Icarus 3D Anime  Medusa is the main character of the single-episode anime short Medusa's Revenge, which covers her past as a Goddess of Skyworld, up to the beginning of Uprising.Super Smash Bros. Ultimate  Medusa appears as a collectable spirit in the game's aptly named Spirits mode.Captain N: The Game Master  Medusa made an appearance in the episode Mega Trouble for Megaland, where she was guarding the Three Sacred Treasures on Mount Icarus. Her design is a mix between her human and monster forms, and she has a beautiful voice to trick her victims into a false sense of safety. This ability worked on the easily fooled Simon Belmont, although Medusa was ultimately defeated by accidentally looking into the Mirror Shield and turning herself into stone.Battle Style  There are four phases to the fight with Medusa in Uprising, all of which take place as an air battle. In the first phase, she will start by blasting Pit away so he can't hit her; at the beginning and when closing in on her, the player can briefly hit her with long-range weapons. As Pit approaches, she will attack by spawning two types of projectiles\u2014rotating, homing green orbs and non-homing black eyeballs. Once these dissipate, she will summon a pattern of rotating lasers (either a pentagon or a square, with the lasers for each side continuing in a different direction), then attack with rubble that can be broken; she will then repeat this process. The second phase occurs once Pit begins to close in. First, she will spawn two floating mines which cannot be destroyed. As Pit gets closer, she will spawn a small, homing eye and then teleport away. To avoid hitting the mines, the safest response is to shoot down the eye. After doing this four times, she will finally stay still enough for Pit to shoot her. She will fire gray projectiles that cause shaking and occasionally teleport to claw at Pit (which is telegraphed by bright red lines appearing on one side of the screen). After dealing enough damage, Palutena will bind Medusa's legs in place, preventing her from teleporting. She will now fire a different type of eye beam, which does not cause Shaking. Occasionally, she will raise her right hand, which has a mouth that spews a poison-inducing mist. Once Pit damages her further, Medusa will transform into a more monstrous form and detach her head to get around the teleport ban. She will chase you around the arena, attacking in two ways\u2014slow-moving poisonous skulls, similar to the ones Thanatos fires in his standard form, and lasers (which also spawn three homing projectiles that can be shot down). Finally, dealing enough damage will cause Medusa's head to reunite with her body. She will clutch her face in pain and raise it back up to reveal her single eye glowing brightly. Shooting this eye will defeat her.Idol Descriptions Medusa, Queen of the Underworld  The one-time Queen of the Underworld, exiled by Palutena long ago. Twenty-five years ago, Pit defeated her once and for all...or so it seemed. Now resurrected and thirsty for revenge, Medusa leads an army far more powerful than before.Medusa (Battle)  The only comfort throughout Medusa's quarter century in exile was the thought of bloody retribution against Pit and Palutena. Now, facing the angel after all these years, Medusa's wrath is only matched by her fervor for revenge.Medusa (Monster)  Long ago, Palutena cursed Medusa with this hideous form. Unable to face the monstrosity she had become, Medusa used her magic to maintain a mask of beauty\u2014a facade that falls when she's forced to put all her strength into defeating Pit.Medusa vs. Hades  Spoiler alert: Medusa saves the day! Medusa's surviving spirit stops Hades before he can deliver the finishing blow to Pit. In her weakened state, she can't hold him off forever, but the goddess gets an A for vindictive tenacity.Medusa (Rare)  Hades reconstructed Medusa from countless souls woven around a core of pure hatred for Palutena. Oblivious to the true cause of her resurrection, Medusa sets out to take revenge and conquer the three worlds completely.Trophy Information Medusa, Queen of the Underworld  Medusa is the goddess of darkness and the leader of the Underworld Army. Although she was defeated in the past, Hades has secretly resurrected her to fight again. Those slithering snakes on her head are really unpleasant. That's got to be the worst hair day ever.Quotes Trivia Pandora  Pandora (\u90aa\u795e\u30d1\u30f3\u30c9\u30fc\u30e9 Jashin Pand\u014dra, \"False God Pandora\") is the Goddess of Calamity, debuting in the original Kid Icarus. For unknown reasons, Pandora lost her physical form and was reduced to a fiery, ghostly ball of energy. However, after bathing in the Rewind Spring, she resurrects herself and reveals\u00a0her true humanoid form, Amazon Pandora. In both forms, she is voiced by Nika Futterman in the English version of Kid Icarus: Uprising.Characteristics Physical Appearance  In the original Kid Icarus, Pandora is an amorphous, bubble-like spirit with only the barest remnants of a face. Her eyes do not contain any irises and there seems to be no substance behind her ghostly facade. In Uprising, Pandora has a much more ghastly appearance, seeming to be made up of a ghostly blue fire. She has a set of sharp teeth and wears a semi-translucent ring on top of her \"head.\" She is also quite large in this form, being around 18'2\" (553 cm).Personality  Known for her trickery, most of the things Pandora says or does are simply an act she puts on for others. That being said, she acts easy-going and sarcastic, and exudes an air of indifference regardless of most situations. This also makes her come across as unpredictable, as she constantly flips between her more subdued facade and how she truly feels. She seemingly does whatever she pleases on a whim, no matter how impractical; such as building a driving course in her labyrinth to get her driver's license, or taking yoga lessons despite lacking limbs. However, it is impossible to tell just how honest she's being when she makes these claims.Abilities  Reflecting her penchant for trickery, Pandora has the power to create illusions. In her battle with Dark Pit, she plagues the battlefield with various traps. In her ghostly form, she attacks with fireballs and can turn invisible to elude Pit, as well as sink into the ground to attack him from below. In both forms, Pandora mainly attacks by creating bombs.Appearances Kid Icarus  Pandora is the Gatekeeper of Skyworld's Fortress, guarding one of the three Sacred Caskets. Centurions are not very useful here, as Pandora can easily mow through them. Pandora's attacks are quite powerful, but she is also slow. This can be a lengthy fight due to Pandora's ability to hide herself and stay out of Bow range, but it is not hard if Pit stays close to her.Kid Icarus: Uprising Chapter 5: Pandora's Labyrinth of Deceit  Pandora is entrusted with the Mirror of Truth and is placed in the Labyrinth of Deceit, staying hidden by the Great Reaper until Pit defeats him. As Pit traverses through her labyrinth, Pandora banters with him and Palutena until they finally reach her room. They engage in battle, then Pandora feigns defeat in order to trick Pit into destroying the Mirror of Truth, which inadvertently brings about the creation of Dark Pit. However, Dark Pit turns on her and promptly defeats her alongside Pit, then uses her remaining powers to grant himself flight.Chapter 9: Medusa's Final Battle  A fake version of Pandora appears as one of the bosses of the chapter, created by Medusa.Chapter 22: Scorched Feathers  Originally thought to be defeated for good, Pandora lived on inside Dark Pit's wings, hitching a ride with him throughout his adventures. Once Dark Pit arrives at the Rewind Spring, she uses the opportunity to separate from him and resurrect herself in the spring, turning her into her red-colored variant. After a brief battle, Pandora uses the spring once more to restore herself to her true form, Amazon Pandora.Super Smash Bros. Ultimate  Pandora appears as a collectable spirit in the game's aptly named Spirits mode.Idol Description Goddess of Calamity, Pandora  As the goddess of disaster and calamity, Pandora builds the Labyrinth of Deceit, where she's thought to be using the Mirror of Truth to create Underworld troops. Though she sounds jaded, it's just an act, for she delights in trickery.Quotes Trivia References Bow  The Bow (\u795e\u5f13 Shinky\u016b, \"God Bow\") is Pit's signature weapon type throughout the Kid Icarus series. While it primarily excelled in ranged attacks prior to Kid Icarus: Uprising, it became capable of melee attacks after Pit's redesign in Super Smash Bros. Brawl.Appearances Kid Icarus  Pit carries an unlimited supply of arrows which can be aimed vertically or horizontally. Though initially short-ranged, his bow can be upgraded to have a farther reach by obtaining the Sacred Bow. In addition, earning Arrows will increase Pit's overall strength, and obtaining the Fire Arrow will increase his damage output.Kid Icarus: Of Myths and Monsters  Pit's bow functions virtually the same as it did in the original Kid Icarus.Kid Icarus: Uprising  The bow returns as one of the nine weapon types the player can choose from. Specializing in ranged combat, its melee attacks are typically weak, which it makes up for in good homing capabilities.Super Smash Bros. series  In Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Pit uses the Palutena Bow for nearly all of his attacks, splitting it into two blades for close-range combat. Pit's bow in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U functions similarly to how it did in the previous installment, only now his Side Special has been replaced with the Upperdash Arm.Viridi  Viridi (\u81ea\u7136\u738b\u30ca\u30c1\u30e5\u30ec Shizen-\u014d Nachure, \"Nature Monarch Nachure\") is the Goddess of Nature and leader of the Forces of Nature. Her goal to wipe out humanity initially puts her at odds with Palutena, though they eventually put aside their differences and work together to face other common threats. She is voiced by Hynden Walch in the English version of Kid Icarus: Uprising, and by Makiko Ohmoto in the Japanese version.Characteristics Physical Appearance  Viridi is a young-looking goddess, standing at about 4'7\" (139 cm) and resembling an 8-year-old human girl with hazel eyes. She wears a shin-length dress colored in purple, red and pink, and decorated with numerous vines. She also wields a large, wooden staff. Her long blonde hair is also tied up in an off-centered ponytail using vines.Personality  Despite her initially destructive nature, Viridi is not necessarily evil; rather, she desires revenge on the human race for taking advantage of nature. As a result of Pit getting in the way of her plans, she often argues with him in a childish manner while sending her Forces of Nature to attack him. However, during the Aurum invasion, she begins to have a change of heart, and remains an ally for the rest of the game. Though she claims that she is only helping Pit because it is in her best interest, it is implied in Chapter 16 that she may secretly have a soft spot for the angel.Appearances Kid Icarus: Uprising  Viridi deems humans unworthy to exist because they are cruel toward nature, so she sends out a Reset Bomb to wipe out two warring factions that are fighting over a false Wish Seed. As a result of their wars, Viridi wants to target the rest of the human race, thus becoming Pit's enemy as she sends Cragalanche on him when he and Palutena interfere. Later, as the bulk of her army battle Hades's army, Viridi commands her remaining forces to stop Pit from destroying her Reset Bomb Depot. Pit then makes quick work of the Reset Bomb Pod and the guards, causing the Depot to explode and fall apart. A furious Viridi then tells Pit that he's now officially at the top of her \"to-kill list.\" During the beginning of the Aurum invasion in Mysterious Invaders, Viridi is forced to form a temporary alliance with Palutena and Hades in order to defeat the extraterrestrial beings. Throughout the Aurum arc of the story, Viridi notably begins to soften up, especially towards Pit. In The Aurum Brain after Pyrrhon merges with the Aurum Brain, she attempts to take him down by using her final Reset Bomb, but unfortunately, this has very little effect and the bomb quickly disintegrates. Viridi helps Pit again after his Power of Flight runs out by sending a platform carried by her troops to guide the angel to the sun god. However, Pyrrhon manages to destroy all the Nutskis carrying the platform later on. As Pit battles Aurum Pyrrhon, Viridi comments on how the Aurum are like most living creatures as they too are concerned for their survival, but unlike most living things, the Aurum are too unnatural and destructive. After Pyrrhon is defeated and sends the Aurum Brain to the other end of the galaxy, the nature goddess states that he \"finally does something useful.\" Viridi also aids Pit in freeing Palutena from the Chaos Kin's control and allowing him to rest at her sanctuary. As Dark Pit makes it through the City of Souls, she learns of Hades's whereabouts and his plan to use \"tons of souls\" to create monsters on catastrophic scales. As Viridi compares Hades's goal with humans disrupting balance on Earth, Dark Pit reminds her that all gods with their wars are throwing everything off balance. She doesn't accept the truth but Palutena makes things clear that gods and humans are all responsible and only Hades is profiting from their struggles. After Dark Pit restores Pit's wings at the Rewind Spring, she saves the former from falling after Palutena points out that he can't fly anymore, having lost Pandora's powers. She observes the final battle between Hades and Pit, rooting for him and enabling his Power of Flight after the Great Sacred Treasure was shattered. Once Hades is defeated and no longer poses a threat, she reintroduces the issue she has with the humans, but is forced to drop the subject and let Pit have his happy ending.Super Smash Bros. for 3DS/Wii U  In the 3DS version of the game, Viridi appears in the background of the Reset Bomb Forest stage. In the Wii U version of the game, Viridi makes several appearances in Palutena's Guidance, making comments on different fighters alongside Palutena and Pit. She is also available as a Mii Swordfighter costume for both versions of the game.Super Smash Bros. Ultimate  Viridi not only reprises her roles in the Reset Bomb Forest stage and Palutena's Guidance, but she also appears as a collectable spirit in the game's aptly named Spirits mode.Idol Description Viridi  The goddess of nature. Viridi wants to exterminate the humans on the surface world, believing they have corrupted the natural order. Yet she also opposes the destruction and blind harvesting of souls committed by the Underworld Army.Trophy Description Viridi, Goddess of Nature  The goddess of nature, she believes it is her duty to return heaven and earth to their pure states, and so she labels humans as contaminants of nature that should be eliminated. She butts heads with human-protecting Palutena but hates soul-stealing Hades even more.Trivia Hades  Hades (\u51a5\u5e9c\u795e\u30cf\u30c7\u30b9 Meifu-shin Hadesu, \"Netherworld God Hades\") is an antagonist that debuted in Kid Icarus: Uprising. A chaotic individual who takes pleasure in the suffering of others, he is revealed to be the true antagonist of the game and the true Lord of the Underworld. He is voiced by S. Scott Bullock in the English version of Uprising, and by H\u014dch\u016b \u014ctsuka in the Japanese version of the game.Characteristics Physical Appearance  Hades appears as a muscular humanoid demon-like deity with purple skin and red tattoos. He has long red, green, and pink-colored hair. He wears very grotesquely designed robes and clothing with asymmetrical shapes and a cape seemingly made out of darkness and fire. He has red lines that run up both his arms and legs. The inside of his body is completely chaotic in design, with even skies, grind rails and surreal structures found commonly throughout. After he is decapitated by Medusa, Hades regenerates a second head composed of blue flames similar to those of Pandora. His eyes in this form are colored orange.Personality  At first glance, Hades is shown to be a mischievous, manipulative trickster. When engaging in conversation, his tone is playfully dull, yet brimming with sarcasm and cruelty. He has a sense of showmanship, using a combination of witty remarks and belittling insults when talking to and about others. He also has a bit of a flirtatious side, constantly making unwanted passes and flattering remarks to and about all the female characters. Hades is considerably arrogant, brushing off any matter as not important. However, his nonchalant demeanor belies his true dark and destructive personality. At his core, Hades is merciless with an utter disregard for life. His lust for killing makes him seem completely unconcerned when his commanders fall in battle, stating that his army is too stupid to have an actual ranking, and has no problem killing off Medusa when she interferes during Hades's final battle against Pit. He also sees souls as nothing more than either materials to create his monsters or nourishment to make himself more powerful, indifferent to the fact that his action is upsetting the natural balance of the world due to his selfish greed and hunger. Hades is also not a completely loyal team player, as displayed when despite setting aside his hostility to combat the Aurum, he sent out Mimicuties to hinder Pit's progress. Despite all his malicious tendencies, he does have a genuine sense of humor and enjoys telling jokes and making puns at even the most odd or inappropriate of times. He also shows genuine respect for Pit as a worthy adversary, holding no grudge against Pit after the latter killed him and destroyed his body, and even complimented his abilities, albeit still throwing a few nasty remarks in his direction.Abilities  Hades is shown to be one of the most powerful characters in the game, alongside Lord Dyntos. Hades is also powerful enough to destroy the Three Sacred Treasures in one blast. Hades has the ability to manipulate souls, and can revive fallen allies or create new monsters using this ability. He can also devour souls to increase his strength and use souls to regenerate lost limbs. However, the latter ability makes Hades more vulnerable to damage. However, Hades's ability to manipulate souls serves as a double-edged sword. By stealing and devouring souls, Hades erases them from existence, keeping them in limbo. This action progressively disrupts the natural balance of the world. In battle, Hades is a fearsome opponent, showing great skill in both magic and hand-to-hand combat. In the final battle, Hades dons his \"Devastation Ensemble\" which he only wears for very special occasions, such as weddings or armageddons. In this state, his entire body is covered in missiles and laser turrets with his face. This turns his body into a literal weapon of mass destruction. Hades can also fire lasers from his hands and face. Hades can spin at speeds fast enough to create twisters, and can teleport at speeds that can only be matched by the Great Sacred Treasure's Pursuit Mode. Like the other gods, Hades can communicate via telepathy and project his astral form.Appearances Kid Icarus: Uprising  During the events of Uprising, Hades revives Medusa and her forces to serve as distractions to keep Palutena and Pit on their toes. After Medusa's defeat, Hades reveals himself by ripping off the credits and saying that he is the one who revived Medusa as well as telling Palutena that the real fun is about begin. Hades first begins his campaign by manipulating Pit into killing off the Phoenix while making him think he is after the Wish Seed. However, revealing that he knew the Wish Seed was a fake, Hades reveals the Wish Seed's existence to the people so that they can kill themselves over a wish-granting item that does not even exist. The subsequent attacks of Viridi, the Aurum, and the Chaos Kin ultimately force Pit and Palutena to ignore Hades in favor of stopping the more immediate threats while he makes a constant presence both through his army as well as with snide jokes and nonchalant insults. During the Aurum invasion in Chapter 15, he sends Mimicuties to toy with Pit. However, he does aid Pit during the attack on the Aurum Hive by having his minions commandeer one of their battleships and ram it into the Hive. Hades's reasons for fighting against the Aurum were purely due to his selfishness, as he considered the Earth to be his to plunder and his alone. In Chapter 17, his army attacks the Aurum Brain alongside Viridi's forces, Pyrrhon, Pit, and Palutena's Army. After Pit is turned into a ring, Hades's forces continue harassing humankind, though Palutena, her army, and Pit's Body become the enemies of humankind as well, under the control of the Chaos Kin. Hades takes advantage of the situation and collects the souls of humans killed during the three years Pit spent as a ring. Upon Pit's return, his forces continued to harass Pit (who is aided by Viridi), humanity, and Palutena's forces (which are under the control of the Chaos Kin). He tries to steal the Lightning Chariot both for himself and to stop Pit and Viridi from obtaining it. During Chapter 20, his forces assault Pit on his way to Palutena's Temple in the Lightning Chariot. After Pit destroys the barrier surrounding the temple, Hades takes the opportunity to attack it and Pit, all the while mockingly suggesting that Pit should kill Palutena instead of the Chaos Kin, but Pit ignores him. In Chapter 22, both Hades and his forces assault Dark Pit on his way to the Rewind Spring and mentions how he would love to get his hands on Dark Pit's soul. Eventually, everyone learns Hades's goal of using the souls of everyone who died in the series of wars to create his army and increase his own power, an act that is interfering with the natural order and is threatening to all. Dark Pit manages to elude him and makes it to the Spring but is attacked by the revived Pandora. When Hades arrives at the Spring, he is greeted by Amazon Pandora, and is shocked to find out it is Pandora herself. Realizing the Spring's power, he plans to destroy it to prevent it from being used on Pit, but fails as Pandora is defeated once again. Though Pit initially takes up the Three Sacred Treasures to mount an attack on Hades, the god proves too powerful as he destroys the weapons with a single attack and swallows up Pit. Hades proceeds to fight off Viridi's army before sensing that Pit is damaging his heart. Just then, Dark Pit uses the Lightning Chariot to pierce through Hades's chest, rescuing Pit. Hades quickly tries to grab them, but they vanish due to Palutena's intervention. Later, Hades confronts Pit again when the latter is given the Great Sacred Treasure. Though it seems that Pit has the upper hand in the extended battle, Hades ends up turning the tables and destroying the suit. However, a recently revived Medusa comes to Pit's aid at the last second, making Hades retaliate and kill Medusa with a single punch. The delay gives Palutena an idea to charge up the remaining cannon of the Great Sacred Treasure, which Pit fires on Hades, ultimately defeating him. Five minutes after the ending credits, Hades's disembodied voice states to the player that he might find a way to resurrect himself for the next game in 25 years. To make sure the player won't think of him as a sore loser, he also gives them the Boss Battle mode.Super Smash Bros. Ultimate  Hades appears as a collectable spirit in the game's aptly named Spirits mode, where he transforms into his battle form upon reaching level 99.Idol Descriptions Hades  The true master of the Underworld. He is immeasurably strong\u2014even among the divine pantheon\u2014but prefers to rule from the shadows, forcing Medusa to do his dirty work. Yet even with all this evil, Hades still manages to act nonchalant.Hades (Battle)  Hades, prepared for the final battle. Covered with missiles, his body is quite literally a weapon of mass destruction. Only Hades's selfish protection of the Underworld's bottom line keeps him from going all out on Pit.Hades (New Legs)  After being cut in half by the Great Sacred Treasure, Hades heads to the surface world to regenerate his legs. Because this trick uses an immense number of souls, the usually invincible Hades suffers damage in the process.Medusa vs. Hades  Spoiler alert: Medusa saves the day! Medusa's surviving spirit stops Hades before he can deliver the finishing blow to Pit. In her weakened state, she can't hold him off forever, but the goddess gets an A for vindictive tenacity.Hades (Final)  Mere moments after having his head crushed by Medusa, Hades returns with a new, fresh complexion. While he attacks Pit with a renewed ferocity, it still isn't enough to withstand the assault of the Great Sacred Treasure.Trophy Description Hades, Lord of the Underworld  The true ruler of the Underworld, he is so powerful that he easily resurrected Medusa for his own amusement\u2014and to distract his foes. Full of arrogance, he does have a genuine sense of humor, though it mainly serves to conceal his callous disregard for life.Trivia Blade  The Blade (\u6483\u5263 Gekiken, \"Strike Blade\") is a type of weapon introduced in Kid Icarus: Uprising. Appearing as the first weapon type available to the player, the blade is an overall well-rounded weapon.Attributes  Versatile and well balanced, blades are relatively easy to handle, as if they were created on autopilot. Unlike other weapons, blades typically excel in both ranged and melee attacks, lacking any significant advantages or disadvantages.Claws  The Claws (\u5c04\u722a Shas\u014d, \"Shooting Claws\") are a type of weapon introduced in Kid Icarus: Uprising. Appearing as two weapons that fit the user's hands like boxing gloves, claws excel in melee attacks.Attributes  Always coming in a pair, claws are lightweight weapons which grant the user the fastest movement of any weapon type. They excel in close range combat, allowing the user to strike opponents with five melee combo attacks instead of the standard three. However, their ranged attacks tend to be weak compared to their melee capabilities.Gaol  Dark Lord Gaol (\u9b54\u738b\u30ac\u30a4\u30ca\u30b9 Maou Gainasu, \"Demon King Gainas\") is an antagonist who debuted in Kid Icarus: Uprising. Appearing as a large, dark knight with a masculine voice, she is later revealed to be a human girl who was trapped inside her armor. Residing inside a dreary castle, she serves as the boss of Chapter 2. She is voiced by Kari Wahlgren in the English version of Kid Icarus: Uprising.Physical Appearance  Gaol wears knight-like armor over her entire body, to the point that only her green eyes are visible. She has a green aura radiating from her hands, and wears a large red cape. Her most notable features are the two massive horns that extend from her helmet. In addition, it appears that the pattern in her cape is made up of numerous eyes. In her armor, she stands at around 7'1\" (215 cm). Outside of her armor, she appears to be a young woman with long, blonde hair.Backstory  Years ago, Magnus and Gaol fought monsters together in the same mercenary group. The two of them would try to compete for the other's glory, as they viewed each other to be friendly rivals. She later went on to spy on the Underworld Army for the surface world but was captured and forced into cursed armor. Now under the control of her enemy, she serves as a general to the Underworld Army.Appearances Chapter 2: Magnus and the Dark Lord  Pit and Magnus are both aiming to defeat Dark Lord Gaol, so the two travel together through Dark Lord Gaol's Castle and battle Underworld troops along the way. Upon arriving in her throne room, Magnus and Gaol act familiar with each other, prompting Palutena to inform Pit that the two used to be friends. After her defeat, Gaol's armor falls apart, revealing a human inside. This upsets Pit, but Palutena assures him that Gaol is not dead, much to his relief.Chapter 24: The Three Trials  Alongside Magnus, Gaol is called upon by Dyntos to participate in one of Pit's trials, where he must defeat the both of them.

She is voiced by Kari Wahlgren in the English version of Uprising, and by Stephanie Komure in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U.Characteristics Physical Appearance  Phosphora is a blonde-haired human-like girl with purple eyes, looking to be 16 or 17 years old and standing at around 5'7\" (170 cm). She adorns a blue scarf that can conduct electricity, causing it to levitate and become rapturous when Phosphora harnesses electricity. She wears a small, black top ending at the midriff, overlapped by two white sashes, and white shorts. She wears open-toed boots made up of black wrappings and has a green-leaved vine wrapped around her body from her arm to her thigh.Personality  Phosphora is a rather sassy individual, shown to be rude to her opponents and seeming to enjoy getting under their skin. She attempts to locate and exploit the weaknesses of others to achieve this goal, such as when she flirted with Pit or made a jab at Palutena's age. She also possesses a rather nonchalant attitude towards most things, brushing off comments and events as nothing but a minor nuisance to herself. Despite these factors, she shows the utmost respect to her goddess Viridi, loyally obeying her orders and referring to her as \"mistress.\"Abilities  As her title implies, Phosphora has the power to manipulate electricity for a number of purposes. With this, she can turn into a bolt of lightning, move at incredible speeds, and teleport. Phosphora can fire bolts of electricity at opponents and electrify the air around her. Phosphora can also use her electrokinesis to create storms. However, if she expends energy too fast, she tires easily and must recharge.Appearances Kid Icarus: Uprising Chapter 14: Lightning Battle  Palutena sends Pit out into the sky, where he immediately comes under fire. As Pit wonders what is going on, Palutena relays some horrible news: both the Underworld Army and the Forces of Nature are now at war with each other, giving Pit two armies to contend with at once. The two watch as both armies lock in a fierce battle with one another, Viridi's side being led by her commander Phosphora, while Hades's side is led by the newly revived Thanatos. As the feuding commanders rapidly zip around the stormy skies, Pit follows closely behind them, and shortly after witnesses Phosphora deal a final blow to the god of death. She then retreats into a massive thundercloud to regain her strength, though Palutena keeps Pit hot on her heels in order to take advantage of her weakened state. Pit lands and traverses through the abandoned Thunder Cloud Temple, which Phosphora now takes refuge in. The angel begins to cut off the power supplies within it, though Phosphora seems unconcerned by this; instead, she pokes fun at Pit and Palutena, even flirting with the former in an attempt to fluster him. However, her attempts to deter them are unsuccessful, as Pit reaches the temple's center regardless and engages her in battle. After her defeat, Phosphora tells Pit that she takes back her earlier flirtatious remarks before disappearing in a flash of light.Chapter 20: Palutena's Temple  Once Pit crashes through the barrier to Palutena's Temple, he is thrown out of the Lightning Chariot, causing the vehicle to charge aimlessly across the sky. Phosphora zips after it, stating that she'll hold onto it in the meantime. Though she doesn't help Pit in his mission, she chimes into his conversation with Viridi when he lashes out at the goddess. When Dark Pit later uses the Lightning Chariot to split open the portal to the Chaos Vortex, the dark angel is thrown out of the vehicle, prompting Phosphora to zip after it once again.Super Smash Bros. Series Super Smash Bros. for 3DS/Wii U  While she isn't playable, she appears as an Assist Trophy, where she zips across the stage and fires lightning bolts at her foes. She will flinch if an opponent attacks her, which will temporarily stop her from attacking.Super Smash Bros. Ultimate  Phosphora returns in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate as an Assist Trophy.Idol Description Phosphora  A beautiful and powerful electricity-based warrior in the Forces of Nature. While victorious in her battle with Thanatos, the wounds Phosphora receives make her weak in the fight with Pit that follows.Trophy Description Phosphora  Phosphora is a young, beautiful, fierce commander of the Forces of Nature. She also has control over electricity, letting her move at shockingly high speed. When I write it out like that, it sounds like she has everything! Well, I did hear she isn't a great singer...Quotes Trivia Thanatos  Thanatos (\u9b54\u795e\u30bf\u30ca\u30c8\u30b9 Majin Tanatosu, \"Devil God Thanatos\") is the God of Death, debuting in the original Kid Icarus under the name Tanatos. A mischievous shape-shifter, he serves as a commander to the Underworld Army and as the boss of Chapter 7. He is voiced by Danny Mann in the English version of Kid Icarus: Uprising, and by Eiji Itou in the Japanese version of the game.Characteristics Physical Appearance  In his true form, Thanatos resembles a genie with green skin, puffy red eyes, and a large blue-lipped mouth, with a single fang protruding from the right side. He stands at a height of around 10'10\" (330 cm), and he has an angular red gem embedded into his stomach, with cracks branching out from it on the surrounding skin. He also has a short, stubby nose and a skull ornament tied into his blond hair. Thanatos wears a magenta-colored scarf and a pair of large, yellow and red striped trousers. In addition, the armor on his shoulders appears to be covered with various branch-like structures that have jewelry hanging from them.Personality  Thanatos is depicted as a very flamboyant and eccentric character. He carries a very goofy and sometimes immature disposition almost all the time, such as covering his ears and pretending not to listen to certain statements while making ridiculous sounds. He enjoys witty repartee and likes to make humorous conversations and jokes, even to his enemies. He is also very sensitive, easily getting offended when ignored or told to shut up. Despite his loyalty to Medusa and not wanting to give up the key, he insists on handling things more civilly at first, wanting Pit and Palutena to hang a while and catch up because he, as he puts it, \"prefers honey to vinegar.\" However, his initial unwillingness to fight may simply be due to laziness, as he also claims he doesn't wish to improve his rank because of the amount of work it would involve.Abilities  Despite Thanatos's goofy demeanor, he is a powerful shape-shifter, able to morph his body into a variety of shapes. As shown in Thanatos Rising, Thanatos can shape-shift parts of his body, such as turning his hand into a large mace. Thanatos can also fire dark fireballs from the spikes on his shoulder and a large, skull-shaped blast of energy at Pit. Aside from his impressive shape-shifting abilities, Thanatos displays other magical talents. He can fly, teleport, materialize objects out of thin air, and use his magic to enchant other objects, as seen when he uses his magic to make the Trojan Horse tank sprout wings and fly.Transformations  Being a shape-shifter, Thanatos has many different forms he uses in battle. Aside from his normal appearance, he can also turn into a green snake, a large bat that splits into a flock of smaller bats, a giant foot, a vase that shoots skulls, a sword surrounded by spears, a Russian nesting doll, and a dragon made of green flames.Appearances Kid Icarus  Tanatos aids Medusa in the final battle, where he pops out of her hair and zigzags across the screen toward Pit. He is easily avoidable, as he keeps toward the bottom of the screen during the fight and will temporarily disappear upon receiving damage.Kid Icarus: Uprising  Thanatos leads the Underworld Army from the Seafloor Palace prior to Pit reaching his base. Though offered a chance to give the Underworld Key to him willingly, Thanatos battles Pit and is subsequently defeated. He is later seen in Chapter 14 leading the Underworld Army under Hades's orders against the Forces of Nature. Engaging his rival commander Phosphora in an aerial dogfight, Thanatos loses and falls from the sky, leaving his ultimate fate unknown.Captain N: The Game Master  Three Tanatos serpents appear in the episode Mega Trouble For Megaland, where they are seen on Medusa.Kid Icarus 3D Anime  Thanatos stars as the main antagonist in the animated short Thanatos Rising. Aside from his ability to shape-shift, he also demonstrates the ability to enchant one of the \"Trojan Horse Tanks\" in the film and cause it to sprout wings and fly.Super Smash Bros. Ultimate  Thanatos appears as a collectable spirit in the game's aptly named Spirits mode.Idol Descriptions God of Death, Thanatos  The god of death. Bored with his 9-to-5 guiding the souls of living to their final resting place, Thanatos turns his work over to the Reapers and leisurely passes his days in a palace deep beneath the ocean.Thanatos (Transformations 1)  A talented shape-shifter, Thanatos takes various forms to fight. As a sword, the god of death is quick to stab, creating openings with his many points. When he transforms into a foot, a crushing stomp is sure to follow.Thanatos (Transformations 2)  Thanatos's alternate forms give him dozens of unique attacks. Whether an urn, a bat, or a nesting doll, Thanatos's wild transformations are only to be underestimated by fools with a death wish.Trophy Description Thanatos, God of Death  Don't be fooled by Thanatos's childish attitude\u2014he's more dangerous than most clowns. And don't expect smiles from the god of death. He serves as Medusa's second in command and, thanks to his shape-shifting talents, can entertain his master with a decent clown act too.Quotes Chapter 7: The Seafloor Palace Chapter 14: Lightning Battle Trivia Magnus  Magnus (\u30de\u30b0\u30ca Maguna, \"Magna\") is a character in Kid Icarus: Uprising. Shown to be one of the most powerful of all humans, he is a seasoned warrior who has weathered many battles. While he remains unaffiliated, he serves as a temporary ally to Pit in Chapters 2 and 18. He is voiced by Fred Tatasciore in the English version of Uprising, and Patrick Seitz in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U.Characteristics Physical Appearance  Magnus's design serves as a foil to Pit's, appearing older, more muscular, having a darker color scheme, and wielding a giant sword as his primary weapon. He also stands at a much greater height than Pit, being around 6'7\" (200 cm). The scar on his right arm is covered partially by cloth wrappings, while his left arm is decorated with a notably large tattoo that extends all the way to his neck. He also has somewhat long hair and wears a pair of large boots that allow him to kick his enemies aside with little effort. In addition to these features, he also wears a necklace made up of stones in various shapes. The blade that Magnus uses is quite bulky in addition to being sharp, yet he can swing it with great precision. The end of the sword's hilt is also decorated with a curved piece of metal that matches the rest of the blade.Personality  Magnus is depicted as being much more serious and no-nonsense than Pit, typically not appreciating the angel's quirkier habits. His experiences throughout the years have also made him quite battle-savvy; while Pit may be quick to fall for traps set by the Underworld Army, Magnus can usually spot them beforehand. However, he has something of a sarcastic side, often making mocking remarks at the expense of others. In the same vein, he has a tendency to speak whatever is on his mind, even talking back to the gods if he has something to say to them. He is shown to be somewhat selfish, as reward money is one of his biggest motivations for his jobs. He also appears to prefer taking the easy route whenever possible, such as when he suggests he and Pit work together to make things easier, or when Gaol points out how typical it is of him to pawn his work off on someone else. Despite some of his rougher tendencies, his Idol description suggests that at least some of this is a front he puts up to deal with the loss of his child. It might be because of this that he displays a more caring side on occasion, showing remorse when he defeats Gaol and seeming to care about returning Pit to his body.Backstory  Many years ago, Magnus and Gaol used to work together as mercenaries. The two would compete for each other's glory while they did their job, as the both of them viewed the other to be a friendly rival. However, this rivalry was brought to an end when Gaol was captured and forced to work for the Underworld Army, leading Magnus to fight against her instead of beside her. During Chapter 2, Palutena also informs Pit that Magnus had a child at one point, who was lost to Underworld troops.Appearances Kid Icarus: Uprising Chapter 2: Magnus and the Dark Lord  While traveling through Dark Lord Gaol's Castle, Pit stumbles across Magnus, who is taking on Underworld troops by himself. The two introduce themselves to each other, then agree to work together to defeat Dark Lord Gaol. When the two arrive at Gaol's throne room and engage in battle with the dark lord, Magnus and Gaol continuously talk back to each other, hinting at the shared history between them. Once Gaol is defeated, Magnus apologizes before kneeling down beside her, seeming to show remorse over the circumstances that led to her defeat.Chapter 18: The Ring of Chaos  Pit, who was turned into a ring, uses a dog's body to traverse through the Decimated Town. Eventually he spots Magnus, who is fighting off a group of Centurions. In an attempt to grab Magnus's attention, Pit hops onto his back and shoves the Ring of Chaos into his face until he finally takes it. However, Magnus throws it behind him and goes to walk away, but seems to have a change of heart when he suddenly goes back, picks the ring up, and puts it on after all. Now having control over Magnus's body, Pit continues through the Decimated Town, conversing with Magnus about the state of humanity during the three years Pit was absent. Along the way, the two agree to defeat Pit's Body in order to free Pit from the Ring of Chaos. After defeating Pit's Body, Magnus crouches down and places the ring on Pit's finger, giving him control over his own body once again. Pit then thanks Magnus and, upon being granted the Power of Flight by Viridi, parts ways with him.Chapter 24: The Three Trials  Alongside Gaol, Magnus is called upon by Dyntos to participate in one of Pit's trials, where he must defeat the both of them. During the battle, Pit asks Magnus a variety of questions, though he refuses to answer any of them, telling Pit he is only there to test him. Upon defeat, Magnus compliments Pit's efforts before he and Gaol disappear.Super Smash Bros. Series Super Smash Bros. for 3DS/Wii U  While he isn't a playable character, he appears as an Assist Trophy, where he prowls around the battlefield and strikes at his foes with his sword. However, Magnus can be made to flinch by hitting him, and he will leave the battle prematurely if he takes enough damage. He also appears as an item in Smash Tour. When used, all players the user KO'd during battle will be launched across the board.Idol Descriptions Magnus  The mightiest human swordsman of all time. With his massive blade and experience as a mercenary, Magnus is a powerful ally against the Underworld. But this hard exterior masks what seems to be the tragic loss of a child.Magnus and Gaol  Years ago, Magnus and Gaol were friendly rivals, often working together as mercenaries, each competing to steal the other's glory. Dyntos gives them a chance to fight together again, testing Pit on his way to battle Hades.Trophy Description Magnus  Magnus is perhaps the mightiest human warrior, and he has weathered countless battles. He seems to prefer working alone, and he can respect the strength of foes like Dark Lord Gaol. However, he seems reluctant\u2014not afraid\u2014to fight Gaol. Is there a connection between these two?Quotes Chapter 2: Magnus and the Dark Lord Chapter 18: The Ring of Chaos Chapter 24: The Three Trials Trivia Palm  The Palm (\u7834\u638c Hash\u014d, \"Breaking Palm\") is a type of weapon introduced in Kid Icarus: Uprising. Initially appearing as an orb with aura whirling around it, it becomes a tattoo on the user's right palm and arm when in use.Attributes  The palm allows its user to harness their own life energy in the palm of their hand, allowing them to shoot projectiles which have the best homing properties of any weapon type. To make up for this advantage, palms usually have poor range.Eggplant Wizard  The Eggplant Wizard (\u30ca\u30b9\u30d3\u4f7f\u3044 Nasubi Tsukai, \"Eggplant Bearer\") is an Underworld enemy that debuted in the original Kid Icarus.Physical Appearance  In the original Kid Icarus and Of Myths and Monsters, the Eggplant Wizard is a purple-skinned monster with large, pink lips and a single green eye. It wears a long, blue robe with a pink and blue cape, and wields a golden staff with an eggplant charm attached to it. In Uprising, its eye is now magenta, which matches its sash-like cape. Its robe is accompanied by brown and green accessories, and its staff now appears to be made of wood.Appearances Kid Icarus  Being located in every Fortress, Eggplant Wizards usually appear in pairs. They throw arched projectiles at Pit which inflict the eggplant curse, a status ailment that transforms Pit into an eggplant with legs. This condition disables all forms of attack for the angel, forcing him to seek out a Hospital to rid him of the curse.Kid Icarus: Of Myths and Monsters  Eggplant Wizards behave similarly to how they did in the original Kid Icarus, only now their curse enables Pit to run underneath enclosures that he normally could not access.Kid Icarus: Uprising  The Eggplant Wizard's strategy is the same as it previously was\u2014to inflict the eggplant curse on its opponents to leave them vulnerable. However, it now has different methods for inflicting this curse: at a distance, it will throw two projectiles toward Pit, and at close-range, it will throw two eggplants directly over him. In addition, it teleports closer if the angel is outside of its attack range, and may also occasionally teleport while Pit is within its range; if this occurs, it will leave behind a single eggplant in its place, which will transform Pit if he is caught up in the blast. Unlike the original Kid Icarus, Pit receives an insignificant amount of damage if hit with one of its projectiles, and its curse is now only temporary, as Palutena will cure the curse herself after a short period of time.Captain N: The Game Master  The Eggplant Wizard appears in Captain N: The Game Master, voiced by Michael Donovan. Eggplant Wizard is one of\u00a0Mother Brain's lieutenants, alongside King Hippo. He spouts fruits and vegetables when agitated or hurt, and often uses them for outlandish purposes.Idol Description Eggplant Wizard  Those hit by eggplants thrown by the Eggplant Wizard are turned into, well, eggplants. Pit can't attack in this state, and the only cure is time. So you'd best vamoose if you don't want to end up baba ghanoush.Trivia Hewdraw  Three-Headed Hewdraw (\u4e09\u3064\u9996\u7adc\u30d2\u30e5\u30fc\u30c9\u30e9\u30fc Mittsu Kubi Ry\u016b Hy\u016bdor\u0101, \"Three-Neck Dragon Hewdraw\") is a large, three-headed serpent monster, debuting in the original Kid Icarus as a single-headed serpent. Possessing three separate personalities for each head, Hewdraw serves as a commander to the Underworld Army and as the boss of Chapter 3. All three heads are voiced by Danny Mann in the English version of Kid Icarus: Uprising, and by Masaya Takatsuka in the Japanese version of the game.Characteristics Physical Appearance  In the original Kid Icarus, Hewdraw appears as a singular serpent with pink scales and a yellow underbelly. It has green fins on either side of its head, and green eyes to match. In Uprising, Hewdraw appears as a large, serpent-like dragon with purple scales and a white underbelly. It now has three heads, each one a different shade of violet: the right head is violet-blue, the left one is red-violet, and the middle one is simply violet. The heads all have amber eyes, and horns on their noses and foreheads. It also has fins on the sides of its heads, as well as on the sides of its body, and on the tip of its tail.Personality Blue Hewdraw  The blue head of Hewdraw is seemingly the most approachable of the three, greeting Pit with a cheerful \"hello\" on multiple occasions. Despite this, he still very much wants to eat the angel and initially attempts to lure Pit into coming within his reach. The blue head also appears to be the calmest of the three, although he doesn't seem to care much for his brothers, considering them as nothing more than \"deadweight.\" He shows a certain vanity in his last moments, claiming he is too pretty to die before passing. His voice is noticeably deeper compared to the other two heads.Violet Hewdraw  The violet head of Hewdraw appears to be the most intelligent of the three, displaying a great sense of superiority over his brothers. However, this attitude puts him at odds with his fellow heads and tends to ignite arguments between them as a result. Despite this, he is still capable of showing others respect where it is due, as he compliments Pit and tells him that he is proud of the angel during his last moments. His voice is higher pitched compared to the other two heads.Red Hewdraw  The red head of Hewdraw seems to be the most impulsive and irritable of the three, focusing more on his hunger than the situation at hand. While he can get annoyed rather easily, this head does display more maturity than the other heads, as shown when he tries to convince the others not to argue when they have company. Aside from these rare cases of decency, the red head tends to yell and whine most of the time. His voice is raspier compared to the other two heads.Appearances Kid Icarus  Hewdraw is the Gatekeeper for the Overworld's fortress, guarding one of the three Sacred Caskets. The combat area consists of platforms over a lake of lava, and Hewdraw's tactics consists of diving in and out of the lava, hoping to catch Pit in its jaws. It has no projectiles of its own, so as long as Pit can avoid physical contact, Hewdraw will fall easily. This fight is made easier with Centurions, since their arrows will stretch across the entire area. Pit must be careful when positioning the Centurions, however, as a lunge from Hewdraw could easily knock out all three in one fell swoop.Kid Icarus: Uprising Chapter 3: Heads of the Hewdraw  Sent by Medusa to attack Skyworld in retaliation for the defeat of Dark Lord Gaol, Hewdraw is soon after destroyed by Pit, but not before two of its heads become separated from its body. However, able to live without their body, the two Hewdraw heads proceed to run amok in That Burning Town. While one head is lured into a courtyard and promptly defeated by Pit, the other takes shelter by a lake and forms a new body, laying in wait for the angel to reach it. Pit eventually confronts the now single-headed Hewdraw and defeats it once and for all. During the fight with the Hewdraw Head, the inside of its mouth is its weakpoint\u2014whereas in the fight against Hewdraw Reborn, its jaw is its weakpoint.Chapter 9: Medusa's Final Battle  A fake version of Hewdraw appears as one of the bosses of the chapter, created by Medusa.Super Smash Bros. Ultimate  Hewdraw appears as a collectable spirit in the game's aptly named Spirits mode.Captain N: The Game Master  Hewdraw appears in the episode Mr. & Mrs Mother Brain where it appears to be a rabbit-like snake. Curiously, it also has a shell on its back and is capable of flight despite possessing no wings.Idol Descriptions Three-Headed Hewdraw  An enormous three-headed flying dragon. Each of Hewdraw's heads has its own personality, causing them to constantly bicker and argue. Lucky for them, the heads can survive if ever separated from their body.Hewdraw Head  After being severed from their shared body, Hewdraw's heads are free to go their own ways. One is dumber than the others, and Palutena is able to lure it with her pheromones, giving Pit a chance to slay it once and for all.Hewdraw Reborn  Hewdraw's incredible regenerative ability allows its final head to regrow a new torso mere minutes after its decapitation. After resting by a lake to regain its strength, the beast later waits to take its revenge on Pit.Trophy Description Three-Headed Hewdraw  A dragon with three regenerating heads. Each head has its own unique personality, and they are not known for getting along. One head would want to destroy a wall, the second would go around it, and the third would fly over it. All three are plenty happy to devour a meddling angel, though.Quotes Trivia Club  The Club (\u5de8\u5854 Kyot\u014d, \"Giant Tower\") is a type of weapon introduced in Kid Icarus: Uprising. Shown to be one of the strongest weapon types in the game, it is capable of a variety of different attacks.Attributes  Due to its massive size, the club is the most powerful weapon of all nine weapon types, possessing the potential to plow through hoards of enemies, pierce walls, and deflect certain projectiles. To make up for these advantages, clubs typically have slower attacks, decrease the user's movement speed, and have limited range. According to Palutena, clubs are actually fairly light when wielded, a feat achieved through magic. Their brute force against enemies is not affected.Trivia Staff  The Staff (\u72d9\u6756 Soj\u014d, \"Sniping Staff\") is a type of weapon introduced in Kid Icarus: Uprising. Typically resembling rifles, staffs excel in ranged combat.Appearances Kid Icarus: Uprising Attributes  Staffs are weapons that have the longest range of any weapon type, typically gaining power the farther they travel. To make up for these advantages, staffs have little homing capability, slow the user down, and possess weaker melee attacks.Super Smash Bros. Ultimate  Listed simply as \"Staff,\" the Insight Staff makes an appearance as an item in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. It fires multiple shots at foes, dealing more damage at a distance.Orbitars  The Orbitars (\u885b\u661f Eisei, \"Satellites\") are a type of weapon introduced in Kid Icarus: Uprising. Appearing as two objects floating to either side of the user, orbitars typically excel in ranged combat.Attributes  Always coming in a pair, orbitars are the physical manifestation of divine power, originally created for defensive purposes. Due to the nature of the separate sources they fire from, orbitars are capable of hitting multiple targets at once. Their shots typically grow stronger the farther they travel, making them most effective at a distance. When used in close-range combat, orbitars will shift from their positions and quickly spin in front of the user, attacking anything within their radius. However, their melee attacks are weak compared to their ranged capabilities.Three Sacred Treasures  The Three Sacred Treasures (\u4e09\u7a2e\u306e\u795e\u5668 Sanshu no Jingi) are a set of three legendary objects, introduced in the original Kid Icarus. Residing inside caskets, they are comprised of the Arrow of Light, the Mirror Shield, and the Wings of Pegasus.Attributes  When used in Kid Icarus: Uprising, the Three Sacred Treasures are rather balanced\u2014they are quite fearsome on lower Intensities, though they can be lacking in power on higher Intensities. Their rapid continuous fire lacks strength, but they make up for it in sheer homing ability. Their forward-dash charged shots possess high knockback power, while their backward-dash continuous fire shoots five arrows in a similar fashion to that of an average bow. Though they slow the user's walk speed and their melee attacks are average, the Arrow of Light is capable of piercing the normally invulnerable Orne, and the Mirror Shield can block attacks that make direct contact with it.Appearances Kid Icarus  When Medusa took over Angel Land, the three treasures were stolen from Palutena's Army and placed under the watch of Twinbellows, Hewdraw, and Pandora. After invading their fortresses and defeating each boss, Pit regains the treasures and uses them in his final battle with Medusa.Kid Icarus: Of Myths and Monsters  After learning of the upcoming invasion of \"the Orcos,\" Palutena assigns Pit a training regimen in order to use the treasures and fend off the demons from their realm. Palutena has entrusted each sacred treasure to a fortress guardian for safekeeping, forcing Pit to work his way from the Under World Tower to the Sky Palace to reclaim them. In the end, Palutena will always bless him with the Wings of Pegasus; depending on Pit's stats, she may or may not also grant him use of the Light Arrow or Silver Armor.Kid Icarus: Uprising  To avoid the treasures falling into the wrong hands, Palutena has hidden the Three Sacred Treasures within the sky's constellations. However, a faction known as the Space Pirates steals the constellations that contained the treasures, forcing Pit to seek them out. After Pit retrieves the treasures, he equips them to battle and defeat Medusa once more. The three treasures are later used against Hades\u2014however, they prove to be ineffective against the lord of the Underworld and are destroyed soon after. Seeking help from Dyntos, the god of the forge, Pit is given a new weapon in the form of the Great Sacred Treasure and uses it in the final battle against Hades.Super Smash Bros. for 3DS/Wii U  The Three Sacred Treasures appear as Pit's Final Smash, where they are used to fire arrows of varying sizes, followed by beams of light that rain down over the battlefield.Idol Description Three Sacred Treasures  The Arrow of Light, Wings of Pegasus, and Mirror Shield Pit used to defeat Medusa 25 years ago. While Pit needs them for his \"first\" run through Chapter 9, you can later choose to not equip them by tapping the icon on the chapter banner.Trophy Description Three Sacred Treasures (3DS)  The powerful treasures used to defeat Medusa, the Three Sacred Treasures include the Arrow of Light, Wings of Pegasus, and Mirror Shield. That reminds me of a bit of trivia: there are in real life Three Sacred Treasures in Japan, but they are a sword, a mirror, and a jewel.Three Sacred Treasures (Wii U)  The Arrow of Light, the Wings of Pegasus, and the Mirror Shield\u2014three legendary artifacts that Pit once used to defeat the evil Medusa. When you activate Pit's Final Smash, he can use them in this game too! After firing a barrage of different bow attacks, his final shot will cause powerful light pillars to rain down on the battlefield.Trivia ", "F2p runescape Wiki": "F2p runescape Wiki Magic  Magic is a skill that is used in combat, to enchant crafted items, to transport quickly around the world via teleports, and to gain money via alchemy. It is probably the largest source of coins in the game. While it is possible to play the game without being skilled in Magic, it is a considerable advantage to be able to use many spells, especially high level alchemy and the teleports.Runes  All spells (with the exception of Home Teleport a.k.a. Lodestone Teleport) require the use of runes as a consumed resource. Runes are stackable, commonly traded items which can be obtained in a variety of ways.Elemental staves  The requirement for certain runes in a spell can be removed if the player wields an Elemental staff corresponding to an elemental rune. As an example, wielding a Fire staff allows a player to cast High Level Alchemy using only one Nature rune.Standard spellbook  The standard spells are activated on any new character's account and they are available on all worlds. There is no prerequisite to using the standard spellbook, although some spells are only available on member worlds and others require completion of certain quests or tasks. As with other skills, new capabilities require higher skill levels. In the standard spellbook, spells fall into one of several categories: Combat, Curse, Teleportation, Alchemy, and Enchantment. All spells yield their associated amount of experience when cast. Combat spells additionally give experience related to the amount of damage caused to the opponent(s).Combat  Mages are weak against Ranged and strong against Melee fighters. When attacking others, you should use a combination of Entangle like spells and highly damaging spells. Curses tend to be underused, but do not underestimate them. When fighting monsters, hiding behind a rock or other object is very useful. Also most undead creatures and demons are weak to magic attack. This will provide an advantage over these creatures. However, you must be careful because certain monsters are weak to certain elemental attacks (air, water, earth, fire). A little known fact about Magic is that as your Magic skill increases so does your defence against magical attacks. Your defence against magical attacks is determined 70% by your magic level and 30% by your defence level. So even if you don't care to use Magic too often, having a high Magic skill can help to protect you.Magical staves  Various magical staves are available in RuneScape. In the list below are all the free-to-play staves, which can all be obtained at Zaff's Superior Staffs! store in Varrock, with the notable exception of gravite, which can be purchased from the Dungeoneering rewards trader in Daemonheim. The main effect of a staff is to boost magic attack and defence, while elemental staves\u00a0effectively provide (for spellcasting purposes) unlimited amounts of their respective rune.Magic armour and robes  Most mages wear robes, although some light armour is available that is made from special material and does not hinder the wearer's ability to perform magic attacks. A free player's maximum magic attack bonus is +55, and the maximum magic defence bonus is +42. This was achieved with Combat robe top, Combat robe bottom, Runecrafter hat, Swanky boots, Arcane blast necklace(15.5k tokens at dungeoneering), Explorers ring (2), Gravite staff (40k tokens at dungeoneering), and the Tome of frost (43k tokens at dungeoneering). The tome of frost provides unlimited water runes, but is held in the offhand slot and can also be combined with a elemental staff reducing costs for several spells.Training magic  If money is tight, it is recommended that you use the Runecrafting skill to make plenty of runes for your magic training, or you can play Fist Of Guthix for free runes. If you have money to spend, buy your runes instead. Certain locations such as the prison in Port Sarim and the demon's cage in the Wizards' Tower can prove to be useful when training Magic.Temporary boosts  Three Prayers can boost Magic. These are Mystic Will, Mystic Lore and Mystic Might, which boost magic by 5%, 10%, or 15% respectively for as long as they are active. These boosts do not increase damage, nor do they allow you to perform spells above your current level. Jagex has confirmed that these prayers only help your magical accuracy and magical defence. Wizard's mind bomb is a type of beer that increases magic by 3, but only by 2 if the magic level is below 49. Players can buy it from the Rising Sun Inn in Falador.Trivia  For free-to-play players the maximum magic bonus of 55 and best armour is with the following equipment:Trivia Quests  Quests are groups of interrelated tasks that can be completed for rewards such as items, skills, experience, or quest points. They are labelled with a blue star or compass rose  icon on your Minimap. Quests can be played only once. The quest journal on the interface has the complete list of quests and are colour coded: As of August 26, 2008, there are a total of 19 F2P quests with up to 40 quest points.Quests Weapons  Weapons are items a player can use to inflict damage in combat. Weapons must be wielded to inflict damage in\u00a0combat.Fishing History  The fishing skill was released on 11 June 2001, along with Karamja and the Pirate's Treasure quest. It was part of a large update that complemented the cooking skill. This update added many of the fish that are currently found in free-to-play, including shrimp, salmon, and lobster. In addition to the fishing spots on Karamja, spots in Draynor Village and Port Sarim were added. When Dungeoneering was introduced, it released ten more different kinds of fish, though they are only caught in Daemonheim.

It is considered on of the slowests skill to raise on the free world, alothough some may argue with Runecrafting (unless you use Runespan), but it can be valuable in combat. 12 combat levels can also be achieved from raising Prayer.History  Prayer was called Necromancy in the extremely early stages of RuneScape and was the last of the original skills in which players were able to reach the maximum skill level of 99. Prayer is also unique in that it was the first skill in which experience could be gained long before any use of the skill was released. Before any of the Prayers were made available, players could gain Prayer levels through burying bones and completing The Restless Ghost.Overview  Increasing a player's prayer level is done through various uses of bones, with Non-members limited to burying them. Similar to magic, prayer has its own \"spells.\" To use a prayer spell, players can click on the prayer menu, to the right of the equipment menu. Prayer spells available for use are highlighted, while prayers unavailable are dark. When a player clicks on a spell, a circle will appear around it, indicating that they are using it. For some prayers, such as Protect from melee, the prayer is indicated by a small icon above the players head. Using a prayer spell drains the player's prayer points; use of prayers is therefore temporary. To increase the time, players simply have to increase their prayer level (or equip items that add prayer bonuses, which reduces the drain rate of all prayers). Once the player's prayer points reach zero, all prayers will deactivate and they will not be able to use another prayer until they recharge their prayer points. To recharge, players must pray at an altar. Prayers are excellent in combat because they give players certain advantages. For example, some prayers improve a player's combat skills, while others can protect them from damage, and others can damage opponents. Players with level 70 or greater Prayer may also bless the gravestones of others, sacrificing prayer points to increase the stones' lifespans.Prayer bonus  To the right of the inventory menu is the equipment menu. Here, players can see their bonuses. These bonuses give players advantages and disadvantages in combat. Players have a prayer bonus. The higher the prayer bonus is, the longer a player can use a prayer spell. Each point of prayer bonus adds 0.33333% (or 1/3%) seconds to the drain rate. For example, with a +15 prayer bonus, Protect from Melee, with a drain rate of 1 point every 3 seconds, will instead drain 1 point every 5 seconds, as a +15 prayer bonus will slow the drain rate by 50%. This means that a prayer bonus of +30 will effectively halve the drain rate of every prayer. To have a prayer bonus, players have to wear certain types of armour, clothing, weapons, and jewellery. See the Equipment section for more information.Prayers  Non-members are limited to only 21 prayer spells. Players can use some prayers at the same time with others, though doing so will drain their prayer faster. Notes:Earning experience  The only way free players can gain experience is by burying bones. To bury bones, players simply have to click on them or right-click the bury bones option. Impious ashes offer 4 xp points.Equipment Maces  All maces give a small prayer bonus. Therefore, it is ideal for players wearing monk robes who wish to arm themselves with something a little more damaging than fists.Neckwear  Some of the more powerful amulets, as well as religious symbols, give prayer bonuses. Twisted bird skull necklace: 9+ Prayer bonus. While worn, this necklace will give a prayer point boost whenever you bury certain types of bones. Need 30 Prayer and 30 Dungeoneering.Rings  Currently only one ring gives a prayer bonus.Random events  Burying bones can result in several types of random events. Shade robes no longer are dropped by shades due to a recent update. They have been moved to the bottom of the stronghold of security, and drop non-tradeable shade robes Note that the combat levels of both of these monsters vary according to the player's level, and both of these monsters are highly susceptible to Crumble Undead.Training  The most common method of training is to bury bones, fight in wilderness, or play minigames and miniquests. Free-to-play: There are a number of bone respawn locations\u00a0: If all the bones used to raise Prayer are bought, a player will likely spend 200 - 400 million coins to buy them all.Prayer flashing  Commonly used to extend trips at monsters that require numerous kills, Prayer Flashing is the concept of a player turning a protection prayer on just before a monster is about to attack, and then turning the prayer back off instantly after the monster attacks. This technique requires excellent skill and timing, and if executed correctly, can preserve prayer and hit points, extend training trips by hundreds, or even thousands of kills, and ultimately avoid banking or ever having to use food while training. This method ( in f2p ) is most commonly used by players with 1 defense and high prayer.Trivia F2P RuneScape Wiki Featured Articles Hi there!

Please help us build up our wiki.Pawn0 o 19:53, July 20, 2011 (UTC)Helping Out  The F2P RuneScape Wiki is a community that aims to create the best resource for the free version of RuneScape, a MMORPG developed by Jagex. To write a new article, just enter the title in the box below. If you are new to wikis, check out the tutorial.Ranged  Ranged is the combat style that allows players to shoot enemies from a distance with projectiles. Players who practice the ranged combat style are often referred to as rangers or archers. The current minimum to be ranked on the hiscores in Ranged is 41 Ranged and 42,575 experience.Range  In the RuneScape combat triangle, Ranged is effective against Magic, and weak to Melee. Ranged combat allows players to shoot enemies from afar; therefore, it is recommended that players stand behind an obstacle so that they can avoid damage, though still deal damage to the opponent. Similar to the other combat clases, ranged combat has a variety of attack styles: accurate, rapid, and long-range. All the attack styles provide both ranged xp (experience points) and hitpoints xp. The amount experience gained by each style is shown in the table below. The rapid attack style will attack the opponent or target the quickest, whereas accurate and long-range attacks hit the opponent at an equal, slower rate. It is recommended that you train using the rapid attack style. This will give a high rate of experience, but will use a greater number of arrows compared to the Accurate style. Accurate mode will improve your chance of hitting. Long-range allows you to attack from a greater distance, while also offering defence xp, with reduced ranged xp. Ranged armour and weapons offer both ranged defence and attack bonuses. The ranged attack bonus determines how accurately the ranger hits. The ranged defence bonus determines how effective the armour is against ranged attack. The ranged level and arrows used by the ranger determine how high the damage can be. Max Hit (free players): Using adamant arrows with a maple shortbow, the Eagle Eye prayer activated, and level 99 Ranged, the maximum amount of damage able to be dealt is 184 in the rapid style, and 189 in the accurate style. Combined with the +5% prayer efficiency boost from the Amulet of Zealots (attained through Dungeoneering), the maximum hit is 192 in the rapid style, and 196 in the accurate style.Range bonus  To the right of the inventorymenu is the equipment menu. Here, players can see their stat bonuses. These bonuses give players advantages and disadvantages in combat. Ranged Strength can be found nearing the bottom of the Equipment Stats menu. Ranged Strength determines how high you will hit, and is affected by the types of arrows you use. For example, the Ranged Strength of an adamant arrow is 31, while the Ranged Strength of a mithril arrow is 22. Ranging armour has one of the the highest defences against magic attacks, along with giving a range attack bonus and range defence bonus. The higher the magic defence bonus is, the better defence a player has against mages. Players can also use ranged prayer spells to give themselves an extra boost while ranging. Players in F2P can now use rune arrows after the evolution of combat as of 20 November 2012.Ranged weapons  .Arrows  Arrows are used for ammunition with bows. The better the arrow, the higher damage a player can deal. However, some arrows can only be shot by certain bows, and some bows can only shoot certain arrows. Non-members can only use bronze to adamant arrows.Crossbows  Crossbows are one-handed ranged weapons (meaning the player can wield a shield with a crossbow) that are often reviewed by players as better all-round weapons for training and pking. However, the only crossbow available to free players is the bronze crossbow, which is hardly useful for dealing high amounts of damage. There are also some special types of crossbows, like the Phoenix crossbow.  Bolts are the ammunition for crossbows. The only type of bolt available to free players is the bronze bolt, which is also the weakest metal bolt in the game.Best F2P armour  The following armour gives the highest possible ranged attack bonus for pures. (Pures do not have defence. In other words, with a defence level of 1) This chart is no longer accurate after the evolution of combat.Popular armour  Rangers have their own sets of armour made out of various materials. Ranger armour is good against magic, though weak against melee. Also, all armour designed for ranging give no strength or prayer bonuses, and most give no stab, slash, or crush attack bonuses.Leather armour  Leather armour is good for beginning rangers. They are very cheap and can also be crafted. Leather armour can often be found in Al-kharid's general store, as many crafters often sell leather items there.Dragonhide armour  Dragonhide armour is the most popular and the recommended armour players wear when ranging. Free players can only wear green dragonhide armour, and must complete the Dragon Slayer quest in order to wear the green d'hide body.Temporary boosts Arrow and bolts droppers Woodcutting  Woodcutting (often abbreviated as WC or WCing) is a skill that involves players chopping down different types of trees and vegetation. It is one of the most popular non-combat skills for free to play users. For each tree, a minimum Woodcutting level is required, and ahatchet that is used to cut it. With each level up, a player will be able to cut trees faster than previous levels. For each better hatchet you get ranging from bronze to dragon you also cut trees faster. Woodcutting is one of the easiest skills to get level 99 in, after the choking Ivy and the Sawmill update for pay to play users. There are a wide range of trees, ranging from normal trees to magic trees. In comparison to Mining, Woodcutting is a much easier skill for players to train and to get level 99 in. Mining becomes more profitable as it is trained to higher levels, but requires more user input, such as clicking on the rocks, while also being slow to train. Woodcutting generates little money at low levels and is, like Mining, increasingly profitable at high levels. Unfortunately, according to the free-to-play Money making guides on this wiki, cuttingYews generates half of the profit that mining Runite ore does. Keep in mind that Woodcutting is still a lower input and faster training skill than Mining, sparing a player an enormous amount of effort for a decent profit. As a player chops down a tree of a certain species, the corresponding type of logs will appear in their inventory. The player can then light the logs with a tinderbox (or with a bow if the player is a member who has completedBarbarian Training) to raise their Firemaking skill, cut them with a knife and make them into bows using theFletching skill for members, or sell them to other players for money. This makes Firemaking and Fletching highly related to and dependent on Woodcutting. In order to chop a tree, a player will need to have a hatchet that they can use (which was previously known as anaxe, but was changed in 2009 to help distinguish between battleaxes, pickaxes and Woodcutting axes.) Hatchets can be wielded in the weapon slot, in order to gather more wood in the inventory, provided players have a high enough Attack level to use the type of metal the hatchet is, as it is still considered a weapon. Normal trees only provide one log per tree; however, higher level trees are able to generate as much as a full inventory of logs per tree. Hatchets can be bought from Bob's store (located in Lumbridge), from the Grand Exchange, or smithed by players using the Smithing skill (except for black, sacred clay, and dragon hatchets, as well as the Inferno Adze, which cannot be smithed). However, Bob only sells bronze, iron, and steel hatchets. Bronze hatchets are given for free as a demo. Players will have to buy better hatchets from other players, buy them from the Grand Exchange, or smith the hatchets themselves. The Inferno Adze is a reward from the All Fired Up activity. Sacred clay hatchets may only be obtained from the Stealing Creation activity. Currently, the Dragon hatchet and the Inferno Adze are the best hatchets in the game. {C}{C}A player chopping a tree using Woodcutting. To chop down a given variety of tree, players will need a certain Woodcutting level and a hatchet which they are able to use. For example, a player will need a Woodcutting level of 75 to cut a Magic tree. A certain Woodcutting level is also required to use each hatchet. For example, a player will need a Woodcutting level of 41 to use a rune hatchet. Also, if a player wants to wield a hatchet, then an Attack level is also required. For example, a player will need an Attack level of 40 to wield a rune hatchet. In most cases, it requires 1 less level to wield a hatchet than it is to use it for chopping wood. An exception is the Inferno Adze, which requires level 92 Firemaking and level 61 Woodcutting to use, but it requires level 1 Attack to wield. It is recommended that players with the required Attack level wield their hatchet, so that they have one more space in their inventory, allowing them to carry more logs. Trees are easy to find, as they are located throughout RuneScape. (The exceptions to this are Morytania, Karamjaand The Wilderness, where many of the trees cannot be chopped down, only examined.) A high level tree, such as a Yew tree, will have its position indicated on the mini-map with a tree icon. To cut a tree, players have to find one and then left-click on it. When the player is done cutting, they can then set the logs on fire with a tinderbox to obtain Firemaking experience, fletch them if they are a member, or sell them to other players. Free players can only cut regular, oak, willow, maple, and yew trees. Previously, the maple trees were members-only, but the log itself was non-members. The Dungeoneering update of 19 July designated a hidden dungeon where free players with a Dungeoneering level of 30+ could cut them. These different types of trees are listed below. However, due to a recent update, trees in certain locations have been altered to look more realistic in their appearance. Some of the pictures below may not be accurate.

Instead, they need a machete, which must be wielded. There is no Attack or Woodcutting level required to wield any kind of machete. Ordinary machetes can be bought from the general stores in Tai Bwo Wannai or Shilo Village. Opal, jade, and red topaz machetes are somewhat rarer, and can only be bought from Gabooty with trading sticks. All machetes are tradeable as well, and can be bought or sold on the Grand Exchange. 'Machete types '{C}{C}{C}Edit Jungle' '{C}{C}{C}Edit' There are three different kinds of jungles. There are light jungles, medium jungles, and dense jungles. When players hack a jungle, they receive thatch spars and initiate the Tai Bwo Wannai Cleanup activity. Jungles are members-only. 'Jungle types '{C}{C}{C}Edit 'Canoes'{C}{C}{C}Edit Main article:' 'Canoe Canoes are used to travel on the River Lum, which goes from Lumbridge all the way to level 35 Wilderness. However, a certain Woodcutting level is needed to carve the canoe tree into certain types of canoes. Canoes are useful when wanting to go from Edgeville to Lumbridge, or vice versa. On 15 February 2011, canoes became free to play. 'How to make canoes '{C}{C}{C}Edit To make a canoe, players have to find a canoe tree and have with them a hatchet they have the required Woodcutting level to use. (With the 15 February 2011 canoe update, it is no longer necessary to have a hatchet to make a canoe; the canoe tutor will lend you a hatchet for free. When you are done constructing the canoe, you automatically return the hatchet you borrowed to the canoe tutor.) Canoe trees can be found at canoe stations. These stations are located along the River Lum, in the following places. {C}\u00a7 {C}Lumbridge: On the west side of the river near the furnace. {C}\u00a7 {C}Champions' Guild: On the east side of the river west of the wheat field. {C}\u00a7 {C}Gunnarsgrunn (AKA Barbarian Village): South of the eastern bridge on the east side of the river. {C}\u00a7 {C}Edgeville: On the east side of the river near the guard post. {C}\u00a7 {C}Level 35 Wilderness: At the lake south of the Moss Giants. Players cannot make a new canoe from this station. When the player has found a canoe tree at one of these stations, they can cut the tree down. The player then has to click on the fallen tree and select what type of canoe they want to make. When the player has made the canoe they want, they then can click on the canoe to push it in the river. When in the river, the player can then click on the canoe and select where they want to go. Canoes can only go to a certain number of stations away. Higher level canoes can go farther than the lower level canoes. 'Canoe types '{C}{C}{C}Edit 'Saw mill'{C}{C}{C}Edit See also:' 'Sawmill training The Sawmill is a members-only area in which players with a Woodcutting level of 80 or higher can produce planks from logs, but when they are done, they cannot leave with the logs. The logs are obtained from log piles nearby, then converted into planks using the nearby machine. Then the planks must be cut by using the planks on a cutting table; a saw is required to do this. Using a crystal saw gives double the experience, in comparison to using a regular saw. Using a crystal saw will only double the experience gained from making each plank, NOT the experience reward given for completion of each task. It is not suggested to use sawmill training unless you have the crystal saw. While using the crystal saw in the sawmill, it will not lose charges. Sawmill training can be a more efficient way of gaining experience, up to 100k an hour, however it will only be better than ivy when using the crystal saw. Still, most players prefer ivy, and some players have not done the quest for the crystal saw. 'Special Logs'{C}{C}{C}Edit Special teak logs and Special mahogany logs can be sold to the Sawmill Operator, north-east of Varrock or exchanged for a completely free conversion of the logs in your inventory into planks. The free conversion requires 2 of the same type of special log. 2 special teak logs can be used to convert up to 26 teak logs into teak planks. 2 special mahogany logs can be used to convert up to 26 teak logs and/or mahogany logs into teak/mahogany planks. If you have only 1 special log or 1 of each type of special log, the sawmill owner will only offer to buy your special logs. 'Other'{C}{C}{C}Edit The woodcutting stumps on Neitiznot can be used to make special items out of the arctic pine logs native to the island. Players must have gotten to this part in The Fremennik Isles quest to use them. 'Nests'{C}{C}{C}Edit Main article:' 'Bird's nest {C}{C}{C} If the player is a member, a bird's nest may fall out of the tree they are cutting. Wearing a strung rabbit foot gives a better chance of getting a bird's nest drop while Woodcutting; however, this requires at least level 24 Hunter. He or she can either pick up the nest and search it or just leave it on the ground, though it is highly recommended that the player search it. When the player searches it, they will be given a random item, either a plain gold ring, or a sapphire, emerald, ruby, or diamond ring if it has a ring in the nest; a red, green, or blue bird's egg (can be hatched in anincubator with level 70 Summoning) if there is a red, green or blue egg in the nest respectively; a raven egg (can be hatched in an incubator with level 50 Summoning) if there is a gray egg in the nest; and a random seed if there are some seeds in the nest. These seeds can be worth quite a lot of money on the Grand Exchange, such as Papaya tree seeds (31,256) and Magic Tree seeds (207,648). The empty nest can be ground with a pestle and mortar to get a crushed nest, an ingredient in the Saradomin brew. This means that players training for a Woodcutting Skillcape may accumulate some profit, even if they are using ivy to train. A crushed nest would sell for about 3,928. 'Solomon's General Store'{C}{C}{C}Edit {C}{C}A player chopping a tree like a lumberjack. Upon the release of Solomon's General Store on 17 July 2012, players can purchase an alternative animation for woodcutting in the form of the Lumberjack woodcuttinganimation. This animation replaces the current animation for all woodcutting and costs 220 runecoins. 'Discontinued Woodcutting Random Events'{C}{C}{C}Edit These events were removed as part of the 25 February 2009' 'Random Event Update. {C}{C}The discontinued tree spirit random event. {C}\u00a7 {C}Lost Axe Head: While cutting trees, a player's axe might split, causing the axe head to fly off. The head would land somewhere nearby, usually 3 to 10 squares away. When this happened, the player had to find the axe head quickly before someone else saw it and took it. (Dragon axe heads were often targets for other players due to their large value.) When the player had found the axe head, he or she could then use it with their handle to put the axe back together. This random event was discontinued due to player complaints and the addition of the Surprise Exam! random event. Jagex determined that loss of the axehead was unfair to players, and the event was discontinued. {C}\u00a7 {C}Dr. Ford: While cutting trees, a piece of wood could fall on a player causing them to get dizzy. With their vision blurred, they had to guess how many fingers Dr. Ford was holding up, to get a fruit. Otherwise, they would be taken away. This event was removed due to various glitches it caused. This event also used to exist in Mining. These events were discontinued after a very short run. A problem arose in its performance, as it did not always work correctly. {C}\u00a7 {C}Ents: A tree may turn into an Ent at any time. Players can tell if the tree they are cutting is an Ent if the tree starts shaking, has an angry face somewhere on its trunk, a yellow dot on the mini-map where the tree is, the name of the tree will be in yellow instead of a teal colour, and the tree is bigger than normal. As soon the tree starts showing the symptoms of an Ent, players must walk away and wait for the tree to transform back into its original state. If the player keeps cutting the tree, the Ent will break the axe. To fix it, players will have to take the axe back to Bob of Bob's Axes, located in Lumbridge, to get it fixed for a price. However, the Inferno Adze and Sacred Clay axe, obtained from the Stealing Creation activity, cannot break. (Ents have been superseded byEvil Trees as a Distraction and Diversion [members-only]). {C}\u00a7 {C}Tree spirits: While cutting trees, a Tree Spirit would appear and begin attacking a player. The combat level of the spirit depended on the combat level of the player it was attacking, but it would always be higher than that of the player. The Tree Spirit's combat level varied from level 14 to 159. The player could either kill it or run away from it. If a player killed a Tree Spirit, it could drop some axes, herbs and seeds for members,bananas, runes, various miscellaneous items, or nothing at all (usually, the level 80+ ones gave rune axes). (Tree Spirits are still available in RuneScape, but only to members attempting to cut trees in the Enchanted Valley.) 'Making money'{C}{C}{C}Edit The logs gathered through Woodcutting can be sold for profit, with higher-level logs usually selling for more. The most popular logs for money are yew logs, which sell for around 479, and magic logs, for around 1,426 coins each (Cutting Magic Logs is not recommended for those trying to get 99). While far from a spectacular income (even with a maxed Woodcutting level, it is unusual to make more than about 150k per hour \u2014even less for free players). Depending on the seeds from nests that you get, however, it still is a good way to make money. The most common place to buy or sell logs is the Grand Exchange. A list of prices for logs can be found at the Grand Exchange Market Watch. You can also get nests from trees, which contain items like tree seeds, rings, and bird's eggs. The nest itself can be ground and sold as well. For advice on making money by Woodcutting, see the Woodcutting section of the Money-making guide. 'Temporary boosts'{C}{C}{C}Edit {C}\u00a7 {C}An Axeman's Folly increases the player's Woodcutting level by one level. This is brewed using the Cookingskill. {C}\u00a7 {C}A Mature Axeman's Folly increases the player's Woodcutting level by two levels. This is also brewed using the Cooking skill. {C}\u00a7 {C}A brown Spicy stew randomly increases Woodcutting, Herblore, Farming, Fishing, Mining and Firemaking up to 6 levels or decreases up to 6 levels. These can be made using the Cooking skill, but only by memberswho have freed Evil Dave in the Recipe for Disaster quest. {C}\u00a7 {C}Equipping the Woodcutting Cape of Accomplishment or operating the cape while it is worn will temporarily boost your Woodcutting level to 100. To obtain this cape, level 99 Woodcutting is required, and it must be bought from Wilfred for 99,000 coins. {C}\u00a7 {C}A Beaver, a Summoning familiar, invisibly boosts the player's Woodcutting level by two levels. 'Helpful items'{C}{C}{C}Edit {C}\u00a7 {C}Lumberjack clothing pieces increases Woodcutting experience. You gain 2.5% more experience when you have the entire outfit set equipped. {C}\u00a7 {C}A Strung Rabbit foot increases the chance of a bird's nest falling out of tree while cutting. {C}{C}{C} {C}\u00a7 {C}A Sacred clay hatchet, from the Stealing Creation activity, doubles experience per log (200%). {C}\u00a7 {C}A Volatile clay hatchet, also from Stealing Creation, gives 2.2 times experience per log (220%). {C}\u00a7 {C}When using the Inferno adze to chop, and wearing the Flame gloves and the Ring of fire, Firemaking experience increases by 5 percent. About 35 percent of the experience players get from Woodcutting is gained in Firemaking as well, due to the Inferno adze burning some logs. The Inferno adze will not burn anything when you chop ivy, because there is nothing to burn; therefore, it acts like a normal Dragon hatchet. {C}\u00a7 {C}A Seer's Headband 3 may give players an extra log while cutting normal trees. {C}\u00a7 {C}Sk\u00f6ll boots gives double the Woodcutting experience gained when equipped. The boots start off with 100% charge. As you gain experience in Woodcutting or Agility, the charges will begin to slowly decrease. The rate of which the charges are used up depends on how much experience is gained and your level in the skill you are training.

However, to use this skill, players must first complete the quest Rune Mysteries. The experience earned from making runes is small, meaning that Runecrafting is the slowest skill to raise. Until May 4th 2008, this was the only free-to-play skill without 1 million accounts on the Hiscores. Runecrafting is the only F2P skill not to have two million people on the hiscores. The current minimum to be ranked on the hiscores in Runecrafting is 30 Runecrafting and 13,363 experience.Rune Essence  To craft runes, players need rune stones, known as 'rune essence'. Rune essence is also commonly referred to as 'rune ess' or just 'ess'. There are two types of rune essence: Normal essence and pure essence.Normal Essence  Normal rune essence is used to make elemental runes and Mind runes and Body runes. This is the only type of essence free players can obtain by mining at level 1.Pure Essence  Pure essence is used in the creation of all runes. It is the only kind of essence which can be made into cosmic runes, chaos runes, astral runes, nature runes, law runes, death runes and blood runes. If you are a member with level 30 Mining or above, you will automatically mine pure essence when mining from an essence mine in a members' world.Obtaining Rune Essence Rune Essence Mine  Both rune essence and pure essence are located in the same network of massive underground mines, known as the rune essence mine. To access these mines, players need to talk to certain NPCs who can teleport them to the mines. A player can either right-click on the NPC and select the 'teleport' option or talk to the NPC and ask to be teleported.Free-to-Play Monster Drops The Great Orb Project  Essence is given through out The Great Orb Project, depending on the player's performance, and can be purchased as a reward after completion.Talismans  Each talisman has a name that indicates what kind of rune a player can make with it. For example, to make air runes, a player needs to find an air talisman. You can buy all talismans in the Runecrafting Guild from Wizard Elriss for ~15 Runecrafting Guild Tokens (awarded upon finishing a game of The Great Orb Project.Tiaras  Talismans take up a space in a player's inventory, allowing them to only hold 27 essence maximum in their inventory. However, a tiara can fix this. A player can combine a talisman and a tiara together, then wear the tiara on their head while still being able to craft runes. This saves inventory space, allowing players to hold a full pack of essence. Players can either craft a tiara or buy one from another player. To enchant a tiara, the player needs to bring the talisman to an altar (explained in the next section). For example, if a player wants to make air runes wearing a tiara, then they will have to bring their air talisman to the air altar and use either item on the altar to combine them. Players can also earn some runecrafting experience from making a tiara, shown in the table below. Additionally, making a tiara does not have a Runecrafting level requirement.Talisman Staves  With the release of the Runecrafting guild, also came the release of \"Talisman Staves.\" A runecrafting staff can be purchased as a reward from the Great Orb Project mini-game, it can be use to make talisman staffs, and has two uses. The first use is that a talisman staff can be used in place of tiaras or talismans. In addition, they can be used to distract the eyes in the Abyss, allowing them to the central portals. This relatively \"useless\" staff is mainy obtained purely for the act of accomplishments as most players will not spend 10,000 Runecrafting guild tokens to buy an item easily replaceable with an easy-to-get tiara. To bind a talisman to a runecrafting staff take the talisman and staff to the appropriate altar and use either of the two on the altar. Runecrafting staffs are not able to be equipped until a talisman is bound to it. With no requirements other than 50 runecrafting, the staff has fairly high Strength bonus (+33).Altars  Runecrafting altars are where players transform their essence into runes. Tiaras or talismans are needed to enter these altars hidden inside the 'Mysterious ruins.'Mysterious Ruins  Mysterious Ruins are large, glowing, grey rocks surrounded by ruined pillars. They are used in order to travel to the altar of the runes being made. The player must have the talisman or tiara of the type of runes they wish to craft. Mysterious ruins can be found by selecting the 'locate' option on a talisman. In the chatbox, the player will notice a message that will tell them the direction they need to go. Once the mysterious ruins are visible, the player must use their talisman on the ruins to be teleported to the altar. If they are wearing an enchanted tiara, a simple click on the ruins will transport the player to the altar.Crafting runes  When a player has entered the mysterious ruins, all they have to do is click on the altar. They will then craft all the essence in their inventory (except any noted essence or essence stored in pouches) into runes.Crafting multiple runes  As a player's Runecrafting level increases, they can make more runes per essence. However, they only earn experience based on the amount of essence they craft. For example, a player may have only one essence in their inventory, but can make two air runes. They will only receive five experience, as they only used one essence. The number of runes made from the essence in a player's inventory in an action that gains a level is determined by the player's level before the Runecrafting action, even if crafting the same amount of essence one piece at a time would yield more runes.Runecrafting Gloves  Runecrafting gloves are a group of rewards from the mini-game Fist of Guthix for 75 tokens. These gloves are only available for Air, Water, and Earth runecrafting. Runecrafting gloves give double the experience for the type of rune to be crafted. For example, a player wearing the Air runecrafting gloves will receive 10 experience per essence rather than 5. 1000 essence may be crafted in this manner until the gloves crumble to dust. Players can play Fist of Guthix to receive another pair.Runecrafting Guild  The Runecrafting Guild is a guild released on August 12, 2008. It is located through a portal on the first/second floor of the Wizards' Tower. Players must have a Runecrafting level of at least 50 to enter the Guild.Training-runes  Runecrafting is a skill that is practiced less in free-to-play worlds, simply because of the distinct advantages members possess. However, it is still possible to train efficiently. Players can also use Runecrafting gloves, that will increase experience per essence crafted, and the Explorer's ring, which gives experience for the bonus runes that it will sometimes provide. The ring also recharges run energy, increasing runecrafting speed.Profit versus experience  Players wishing to profit from Runecrafting should take advantage of their ability to craft multiple runes. Depending on the Runecrafting level, it is possible to purchase essence, craft many runes from the essence, sell the runes for a profit, buy more essence, and repeat. This may result in less experience due to crafting lower-level runes, though it is possible to make good money using this method. Crafting earth runes at the altar north-east of the Varrock east bank, was once a way to make good balance between quick runecrafting experience and profit. Since the price of\u00a0 earth runes dropped rapidly to 11gp each recently, players should be aware of certain loss when runecrafting earths. Profit potential is better for runecrafters with level 52 or higher Runecrafting; that is the point at which it becomes possible to craft three earth runes per essence. These runes will not sell for quite as much as the number of air runes craftable at this level, but players will earn faster experience. Water runes may earn you potentially slightly more money per trip, but it is further away from a bank in terms of how long it takes to travel between the bank and the altar. Changes to shop quantities of runes and reduction in price floors and ceilings in the grand exchange have allowed the price of rune essence and most runes to change drastically. Recently, as of October 2009,\u00a0rune essence has been far more expensive, around 70gp. Earth runes are up as well about 25gp. Water runes are the most affected, tripling in value to around 45gp. Airs are still around 10-15gp. Fire runes are down to 6 gp. Body and mind runes are virtually unaffected at 8-10gp still. With these prices airs will not produce profit unless crafted with lvl 66+ runecrafting. Earths are a good compromise between profit and experience, especially when using gloves and lumbridge ring. Waters however are the best for money, profiting when getting multiple runes per essence.Training-Tiaras  Tiaras are another method of gaining runecrafting experience. To get experience from tiaras, a player takes 1-14 talismans to the appropiate altar, along with an equal number of Tiaras\u00a0(Ie. body talismans to the body altar. ) Once inside the altar use either a talisman or a tiara with the altar. NOTE: using the talisman with the altar will bring up a menu asking if you want to make tiaras or staves so using the tiara with the altar is reccomended. Repeat for all the talismans you have with you. There is no resale market for embued(assigned to an altar) tiaras, so doing this is a total loss of money, but\u00a0as each\u00a0trip\u00a0yields up to 525 experience, it can be a very fast method for xp for the player who just wants to get lvl 50 and has plenty of money to spare.Training Tips Running and runners  A common method for training runecrafting is by using runners. A runner is a player that changes noted essences into unnoted ones by converting them in a bank or a shop. The runecrafter increases the amount of essences processed and the runner gets a good reward. Common player worlds where runners are used are:Transportation  The Runecrafting Teleport Tablets obtained from The Great Orb Project minigame can offer extremely fast experience. By teleporting to the runecrafting altar, then teleporting to a bank, players can craft runes with almost no need to walk.Other  Accounts have been created solely for the purpose of aiding runecrafting.Tiaras  You can still craft 14 tiaras in 1 trip while using altar teleport tablets even though they take up an inventory space. Wear a blank tiara instead of an enchanted one and carry 13 tiaras and 14 talismans in your inventory. When you get to the\u00a0ruins use\u00a0a talisman on them.Demon Slayer Walkthrough  The Gypsy will tell you about a story involving a demon named Delrith. He is being summoned again, and you have to kill him. She tells you to talk to Sir Prysin to help. So, go north to Varrock Castle, and on the western side of the castle, Sir Prysin should be walking around. The gypsy will give you an incantation. Write this down, as it is different for each player. In the current version, it is 5 words, which, seeing as some are repeated, means more than 125 possible permutations. If you do forget the incantation, simply talk to The Gypsy again at any time during the quest, and she'll tell you it. Tell Sir Prysin that the Gypsy sent you. Ask for Silverlight, the weapon needed to kill Delrith. He will say he kept it hidden because of it being so powerful and needs three keys to open it.First key  Go to the room in the northwest corner of the castle and climb the stairs. You will be in a room with guards. Climb the stairs in this room. Captain Rovin will be walking around. Talk to him and tell him that what you're talking about is important. Tell him that a demon is going to invade the city, and that you have to defeat it. Select the option that says Sir Prysin said he would give you the key and then select the option that says \"Then why did he give you the key?\". After a little talk about Sir Prysin's clumsiness he will hand it to you.Second key  Go down to the first floor of the castle. Go into the room located northeast. It looks like a kitchen. Look for stairs or a ladder that leads up. Go up them and then go into the room near you to see a bucket. Grab it. Now go back down, and in the kitchen, look for a sink. Use the bucket with the sink. Next, go out the door in the kitchen that leads outside and look for a drain. Use your bucket of water with the drain. The second key will have fallen down. Head east out of the castle and look for a manhole. On your mini map, it will have a red exclamation mark. Open the manhole if it is closed and then climb down. Now go north west and follow a path until you reach a stream. You should see a key to your left, next to a pile of skeletons. (It will not have a red item dot on the mini map.) Pick it up.Third key  To be quick, just get 25 bones. Then, head to the Wizards' Tower, located south of Draynor Village. When you're inside the tower, climb the stairs to go to the second floor. Talk to Wizard Traiborn about the key, and he will ask for 25 bones. If you have them already, give them to him. If not, go get 25 bones by killing the wizards walking about go . When he's done his ritual he will give you his key. He will not take bank noted bones.Banishing Delrith  Now that you have the legendary sword, Silverlight in your possession, it is time to banish the demon Delrith. Wield Silverlight and bring some good armor and food, and get ready to fight. Head south of Varrock until you reach the entrance with the guards walking around. Go a bit east to the stone circle surrounded by 6 or 7 Dark wizard (7) and Dark wizard (20). Also, it is optional to go back to Gypsy Aris and get the incarnation again. Once you arrive there, holding the sword Silverlight, you will see a short cutscene. Three Dark wizards and Denath will summon a tall, red and black demon known as Delrith. Then, Denath will notice Silverlight and run away, leaving Delrith and the Dark Wizards. Now the fight will begin. After the cutscene, you will be put in a small arena, cut apart from the outer world, but if you walk out to the edge, you will return to the stone circle in front of varrock. To return to Delrith's arena, walk back near the stone circle. A good tactic is to turn off Auto-Retaliate in the Combat Style Menu, so if a dark wizard attacks you, the user won't go charging at the Wizard, and instead target Delrith. If a wizard is stopping you, hide behind one of the stone pillars, where they cannot see you, and wait for Delrith to walk close. If you are lower-leveled than Delrith, you'll have to right-click on him, and select Attack, instead of directly clicking on him. Your player will charge at him, resulting in a combat. The dark wizards will continue walking around doing nothing. Delrith has only seven Hitpoints, and if you are over level 20, then it is a high chance to have a 1 hit kill. After his hitpoints reach 0, he will bend over, now becoming Weakened Delrith, who is combat level 1 and has 0 hitpoints. Now you will get a small menu, with the words of the incarnation. Repeat the 5 words like Gypsy Aris said, and Delrith will get sucked into a vortex and be banished from the realm.  The 5 Words are, in the following order:.....Gabino.....Carlem.....Aber.....Camerinthum.....Purchai..... Notes: Do not try using cheats or walkthroughs, or videos to help you, because the incarnation is different every time. Delrith has less than 10 hitpoints, and is considered one of the weaker demons. Delrith looks a lot alike to a lesser demon, in the body form and such. There is no point of killing the dark wizards in the battle, because they will respawn soon enough. Delrith is only level 27 because he was just summoned. To see more, read the text Delrith and Weakened DelrithReward Hint  To make money players can speak to Sir Prysin and obtain additional Silverlights by repeatedly dropping the sword and asking for a new one. Once this process has been repeated the desired number of times, players may sell the additional copies to the Wise old man of Draynor Village for 80 coins each. To avoid being attacked by all of the dark wizards,you should be at least level 41 as the level 20 dark wizards can hit up to 6. Delrith's HP is so low that when you attack him using Silverlight, an imp has more HP than him. The only dangerous part of the battle are the wizards.Trivia Armour  Armour is any item in Runescape that provides combat bonuses. There are three types of armour Melee, Ranged and, Magic. Melee Armour Melee armour is made of metal and provides good protection against ranged attacks. It is weak against magic. Most melee armor requires a player to reach a certain defence level before it can be put on. All players can use bronze and iron armour as it requires only one defence. Steel provides more protection but requires five defence. Black armour can not be smithed by players. It is only found as a drop. It is considered a symbol of wealth for lower level players it cost more than the stronger mithril armour for this reason most players skip black and upgrade to mithril from steel. Black requires 10 defence. Mithril is great for lower levels, much stronger than steel but requires 20 defence. Adamant is strong armour used by medium level players. It requires 30 defence and may take some time for a player to get there first set of it. Rune armour is considered the best Armour for most melee players. A player getting their first set of rune is good achievement. Most of them have worked on resource gathering skills,mining or woodcuting, or have saved up money from selling drops. Ranged armour Unlike melee armour, ranged armor requires defence and a ranged level to wield. Ranged armor offers average protection against most attacks, but its speciallty is that it offers protection against magic attacks. Ranged armor is also very cheap; a full set of green dragonhide costs no more than 10k. For new players and starting rangers, there is leather. There is no requirements to wear leather, and it is very cheap. For players with 10 defence, you can replace your leather body with a hardleather body, which offers more protection. Then, there is studded armour. This armor requires 20 ranged and 20 defence to wear. A coif counts as studded armour. Finally, there is green dragonhide, wich requires 40 ranged and 40 defence to wear. The green dragonhide body requires the completion of Dragon Slayer quest to wield. The green dragonhide coif may be purchased at the grand exchange or at Fist of Guthix with tokens obtained from the minigame. Magic Armor Magic armor is the weakest armor in the game. It barely has any defence bonuses and it requires low levels to wear. For starters, there is the blue wizard set. It does not have any requirements and it is easy to obtain. For stronger mages, there is the combat and druidic robes. These are the best f2p robes but they are expensive if not obtained at fist of guthix. Most mages will also have melee shields or anti-dragon shield with them for added protection.Strength  Strength is a skill that determines how hard you hit (amount of damage). When using melee, there is normally an option to train strength, instead of attack, defence, or Shared XP.Defence  Defence is a skill that gives player protection. As a player raises their Defence level, opponents will deal damage less often. Defence does not influence the amount of damage that will be taken. Defence levels also affect what kind of armour a player can equip. A small selection of players choose to focus exclusively on Defence and not train any other combat skills. These players are known as defence pures. It is suspected that the number is low due to the cost dying as a defence pure and the limited appeal of long combat round between a defence pure and their opponent.Fighting defensively  To increase a player's Defence level, they must choose the \"defensive\" attack style. To do this, a player has to click on the image with the two swords beside the menu that shows their skills. This menu is called the \"attack style menu\". The player can then click on the attack style that says \"defensive\" in brackets. While fighting defensively, players will not be hit as often as they would when fighting aggressively or accurately and when they are, the damage is reduced, to the minimum of 0, making it as if the player was never hit by the attack. Fighting defensively will also reduce how often you hit and how hard you hit.Strategy  Having a high Defence level is key to any fighter's success. If one wants to land strikes, one has to also be able to take them. The Defence skill lowers the frequency of opponents' attacks landing and causing damage, countering the opponent's Attack skill and by extension their Strength. Numerous players, especially melee-pure player killers, neglect their Defence in favour of training Attack and Strength or Strength alone. Often, Defence is left at level 10, so as to enable the wearing of popular black armour. Though this strategy gives a person high power in their attacks, it is not recommended. Even if a person in the Bounty Hunter arena boasts very high Attack and Strength levels, if they do not have the ability to wear or do not possess decent armour, a person of a comparable level with high Defence may kill them with little or no trouble. Therefore, it is becoming increasingly popular to train defence to at least level 40, as to enable the player to wear the ever-popular rune armour.Experience-this is out dated  A formula is used that decides how much experience a player obtains when fighting defensively. If a player hits an opponent, whatever damage they deal is multiplied by 4 and given to the player's Defence skill. For example, if a player hits a 1, then they will receive 4 Defence experience. Some experience is also given to a player's Hitpoints level when they deal damage. If a player hits an opponent, whatever damage they deal is multiplied by 1.33 and given to their Hitpoints. For example, if a player hits a 1, then they will receive 1.33 Hitpoints experience, in addition to the 4 experience in defence. If a player fights with the \"controlled\" attack style, then whatever damage they deal will be multiplied by 1.33 and given to the player's Defence, Attack, Strength, and Hitpoints level. Defence can also be trained by training the Ranged skill in the \"long range\" attack style. For every hit dealt to the opponent, players receive 2 Ranged experience, 2 Defence experience, and 1.33 Hitpoints experience. Defence can also be trained by attacking with Magic spells while autocasting with a staff with a defensive cast style. Doing so gives players 2 experience points to Magic and 2 to defence, as well as the 1.33 to Hitpoints.Defence bonuses  Some weapons and armour give players \"defence bonuses\" against certain attack types. These bonuses can be seen in the equipment menu, to the right of the inventory menu. Defence bonuses give players advantages as well as disadvantages in combat.Other defence bonuses Defence requirements  Defence levels required to equip different types of armour are as follows:Maximum defence bonus  Below is a table, how to get the maximum overall defence bonus. Maximum defence bonus is needed to get a maximum defence bonus of a certain type.Temporary boosts Goblin Diplomacy Walkthrough  Like the goblin generals had said, the goblin race is on the brink of civil war over armour colour. They want orange armour. If you have not dyed anything yet, ask the generals \"How do I get orange goblin mail?\". After a while of chatting one will say \"You get a goblin mail and dye it orange. Grubfoot stole yellow dye from old lady in Draynor, perhaps you can get it there?\". When you ask where to get a goblin mail, a general will say \"In crates somewhere. Can't remember where, though.\" The armour is located in crates, one behind the general's hut, one next to the western hut, and one up a ladder near the entrance. At Lumbridge, go to the backyard of Farmer Fred's farm, which is at next to the sheep paddock. Walk around behind it, and you will see a small onion patch. Pick two, and continue to Varrock. Next go to the Varrock southeast mine. Just a bit to the northwest of the mine, between the mine and the Varrock city wall, there'll be two types of berry bush. The pink bushes are cadava berries. These are poisonous and have no use except in the Romeo & Juliet quest. The red bushes are redberries. You will need three redberries from the bushes. Next go to Falador Park. Talk to Wyson the head gardener which you will find east in the park. He sells woad leaves. Ask him if you can buy some. When do so, he'll ask how much you are willing to pay. When the menu comes up click \"about 20 coins\". He'll say you are generous and will give you 2 woad leaves. The alternative is to click \"about 15 coins\" and he will give you one woad leaf. Do this again, and the total price being 30 coins. Now, walk south out of Falador, then follow the road past the farm with the chickens, and continue south then east until you reach Draynor Village. Go to Aggie the witch. Ask her if she can make you anything. She will say she can make dyes. Ask her to make either a blue, red, or yellow dye. Do this 3 times, doing a different colour every time. Every dye will cost you 5 coins. When you have every one, mix the red and yellow dyes to make orange. Dye one goblin mail orange, one blue, and leave the last one brown. You could also buy the dyes from the Grand Exchange for a quicker play through. Go back to Goblin Village. Give the orange mail to the generals. They will have Grubfoot try it on, and say they do not like it. They will then tell you to bring them blue now. Give them the blue mail. They will have Grubfoot try it on again, and reject it again. They want brown now. Give them the plain brown mail. Grubfoot tries it on for the last time. They decided that brown armour is best. Congratulations, quest complete!Reward Music  Music tracks unlocked: Goblin Village bg:Goblin DiplomacyTrivia  Template:Goblin SeriesVampire Slayer Walkthrough  [[Morgan|Morgan]] will tell you that a vampire is causing distress by killing the inhabitants of Draynor Village. He asks you to kill it. He will tell you to go to the Blue Moon Inn and talk to Dr. Harlow who he says was a former vampire slayer. Before this, go upstairs in the same building you talked to Morgan in and look for a cupboard. When you've found it, open it and search it to receive garlic. Next, buy a hammer from a general store (Port Sarim, a nearby town, has one), or if you have one in your bank, get that (there is a bank in Draynor Village, the same place that you start this quest). Go to the Blue Moon Inn which is located in Varrock. When approaching from the south entrance, you will see first a cottage to the east, and directly north of it, an inn with a blue moon sign. This is the Blue Moon Inn. Once inside, talk to Dr. Harlow. Tell him Morgan needs his help. He will want you to buy him a beer. Find the bartender, buy a beer, and then talk to Dr. Harlow. He will talk about vampires and give you a stake. Now that you have the required items, you must now fight the vampire. Make sure you at least have garlic, a hammer, and the stake (a weapon, armour and food might help as well). Go to Draynor Village, and then head north to Draynor Manor. Inside, go east towards large stairs that lead downwards. Go down them. There will be a coffin in the centre of the room. Open it and the vampire will pop up and attack you. If you have garlic, he will become very weak and can be more easily defeated. (Despite this, it is still useful to note that if you do, every time you hit a \"0\" on him, Count Draynor will heal 1 hit point of health.) There is also a known safespot in the Count's lair: just lure him so that he walks into one of the red banners around the walls of his crypt and stay directly behind the banner adjacent to his own. This can give you time to heal, take other necessary actions before attacking him again or to use numerous sneak attacks on him (\"hit-n'-run\" sort of strikes). If and when you defeat him, you will automatically stab him with the hammer and the stake. When he is dead, you will have finished the quest. Exit back door east in the manor and return to quest starting point.Reward Trivia Black Knights' Fortress (quest) Walkthrough  Obtain all items necessary for the quest before starting. They will fit in inventory and this will save time.Getting Started  Start the quest by talking to Sir Amik Varze on the 3rd floor of the White Knights' castle in Falador, the west side. Sir Amik asks you to 'check on' the Black Knights' Fortress (north side of Ice Mountain) and will give you a Dossier of information.At the Fortress  Equip the bronze helm and and iron chain-mail. This is your \"disguise\" to pass the guards, making them think you are one of them. Once inside, the disguise will no longer be necessary and you may switch to your better armor if you brought some. Enter the sturdy door on the south side of the fortress, and then push the north wall you are facing to enter a secret area. Climb up the ladder (L1), then the ladder you find on the next floor (L3). On this floor there are boxes blocking the way, so proceed down (L4), enter the room to the east with a fenced off section. Head up (L5) then down (L6) to get to the eastern side of the room. There is a Chaos altar here if you need to recharge your prayer. Proceed through the door and then down ladder (L7), where you will be in a hallway behind the witches room. At the end of this hallway 'listen at grill' to hear the devious plan of the black knights and the witch, and how to stop it.Stopping the Evil Plan  Reverse your path now, and get back to the the main floor where you first entered. There is a door to the east into a dining room which you will need to go in. A guard tries to stop you and you will be attacked by a Black knight. Kill him or not, then take ladder L2 up. Walk to the end of this passage and push the wall into a small room right over the witches room. There is a hole in floor directly above the witches cauldron. USE the cabbage on this hole and watch it tumble into the cauldron. The potion becomes ruined. Make your way back to Sir Amik in Falador any way you choose where you will be granted your reward.Rewards Trivia Rune weapons  Rune weapons are weapons stronger than adamant weapons. As with all things rune, they have a teal colour. Players require an Attack level of 40 to wield them. They are the second strongest weapons available to free players after the corrupt dragon.Information  Rune weapons give high attack bonuses. Rune is more expensive than adamant and are the strongest non degradeble weapons free players can use.Romeo & Juliet Details  This quest no longer exists. Romeo can be found in or near Varrock square. Speak to him and he asks you to talk to Juliet.Speaking To Juliet  Talk to Juliet, she is located in the second floor of the house(usually standing on the balcony or sometimes in her bedroom) directly out of Varrock west gate. She will give you a letter to give to Romeo.Father Lawrence  Romeo reads the letter and doesn't know what to do. He suggests going to Father Lawrence, who is located in the church north of Varrock's east bank. After a bit of an argument with Father Lawrence, he mentions a cadava potion, and asks you to speak to the Apothecary just west of Varrock's south gate. He is in a little house, with the symbol of a purple potion.The Potion  Speak to the Apothecary and he will tell you he needs cadava berries. They can be found near the Varrock East Mine. You will need to pick them from the bushes with the pink berries. The red berries are redberries, and can not be used for the quest. Alternately, you can grow a cadava bush and pick berries off it. When you have them, return to the Apothecary and he will give you the potion. Drinking this potion yourself would result in temporarily knocking yourself out.The Plan  Now, head back to Juliet and give her the potion. You will now see a cut scene of her \"dying\", though she really falls into a coma. Go back to Romeo and tell him that he must rescue Juliet from the crypt. Apparently, he needs someone to accompany him.Reward  5 quest points.Trivia References Firemaking  Firemaking is a skill that can be used to light things, such as logs or lanterns. Many players dislike Firemaking and consider it one of the least useful skills in RuneScape. Since burning logs and lighting lamps gives little to no profit (save for those who pick up the ashes of the fire and sell them) players see nothing of value from raising it. However, the logs that players can burn give relatively large amounts of experience, and is a relatively easy skill to raise. Training to level 99 Firemaking only should cost at most 3,000,000 gp. A good use for Firemaking is being able to cook things on the spot, such as killing rats and cooking their meat on the spot. The current minimum to be ranked on the hiscores in Firemaking is 38 Firemaking and 30,700 experience.How to make fires  To make a fire players need a log, which can be obtained by cutting trees, and a tinderbox. Tinderboxes can be bought from a general store, such as those in Varrock, Falador and Lumbridge, for 1 coin. There are three ways of lighting a log. The first way is to use a tinderbox with the log. When a player does this, they will automatically drop their log and light it with their tinderbox. Another method is to drop the log and then right click the log and select the 'light log' option. The final way is to drop the log, then use the tinderbox with the log. This way is almost never used, but it is still available. After a player lights a fire, they will automatically walk one step to the west if there is room there, otherwise they will take one step east. If both ways are blocked, your player will go south. If all three ways are blocked, you will go north. It is advised to have a clear path to the west so that players can go on burning logs without having disruptions. However, a fire cannot be lit just anywhere. Fires cannot be made on top of other fires, inside some buildings, or on top of certain ground features, such as flowers. If you start one fire and have a clear path for more fires, you can quickly light the next fire. When you are in the process of making one fire get ready to start the next as soon as you finish lighting the first fire. The chat box will say \"The fire catches and the logs begin to burn.\" instead of \"You attempt to light the logs.\" This process is called power lighting or power firemaking.Logs  Players need certain Firemaking levels to burn different types of logs, as shown in the table below. When a log is lit, it will stay on fire for a short while. How long a fire stays lit is always random, therefore yew logs do not necessarily burn longer than a normal log. A high Firemaking level does not make fires last longer.Free-to-play Training  Listed below are some ways free players can raise their Firemaking level.Trivia References The Knight's Sword Ingredients  If you want to finish the quest faster, get the items now. You're making a sword for a knight, but, you can make one for yourself. If you choose to make one for yourself, you'll need 4 iron bars and 2 blurite ores (explained later). You now need 1 redberry pie. To make a redberry pie mix flour (made by grain) and water (make sure to put it in a bucket or jug!) and mix together to make a pastry dough and put in a pie dish (located inside Varrock Castle) then pick a redberry (found along the east wall of Varrock. Don't pick the poisinous cavada berries!) then use the redberry with the pie dish. Next, cook it on a range to complete it. Note that you will need at least level 10 cooking to make a redberry pie. If you cannot make a pie, simply buy one from another player.Walkthrough  The squire will tell you he lost Sir Vyvin's sword, and would like you to help him replace it. The squire will tell you to talk to Reldo, Varrock's librarian. So go to Varrock Castle and to go the far north of the castle to find Reldo. Ask Reldo about Imcando dwarves. Reldo will tell you that one is located south of Port Sarim. If you haven't already made a redberry pie, make one now. If you have, continue to Port Sarim and then head south. You should see a small house on the side of a hill with an anvil logo. Look for Thurgo, who is an Imcando dwarf. Ask him if he would like some redberry pie. He'll take the one you have and eat it. Talk to him again to ask him about the sword. He says he'll need a picture of it. So go back to Falador and talk to the squire. The squire will tell you that Sir Vyvin has a portrait in his room. Go to the third floor of the castle and find Sir Vyvin (his room can only be accessed from the second floor, up the stairs in the middle of the castle). Look for a cupboard nearby and open it and search it. You will obtain a portrait that shows the sword. However, Sir Vyvin will stop you if he is in the room. There are three ways to avoid this: Once you have the portrait, go back to Thurgo. Talk to Thurgo and give him the portrait. He now knows what kind of a sword he is making, a blurite sword, and he will need the materials to make the sword. You will have to enter the dungeon on the hill nearby to obtain the blurite ores. All enemies in the cave are aggressive so bringing food could save your life. It is also recommended you only bring a pickaxe if you want two blurite ores so that you can get your own sword. So go down the ladder and walk through. When you see white ahead of you, be prepared to run. Run along the walls to find blurite ores. The rocks are grey with bright blue streaks running down the sides. Mine one ore or two if you want your own sword. When you have the amount of blurite you want, run out. It may be helpful to have a bodyguard to protect you from the aggressive monsters; however, if done correctly, a level 3 player can get the ore. Note: There is a spot where the monsters cannot attack you. It is right next to the entrance to the members-only area of this dungeon. It is recommended you mine at the blurite ore rock right next to this area, so you can easily retreat to safety if necessary. The blurite rocks now have the \"seam rock\" style with only a vein of colour, instead of their old solid colour style and the positions have changed from those shown in many guides. Now, get your iron bars. Talk to Thurgo with your blurite ores and your iron bars. He will make you a sword. If you want a sword for yourself, drop the sword Thurgo just made and talk to him again with the materials. Do this very quickly. He will make a second sword. Then pick up the sword you dropped. You now have two swords. Go back to the squire and talk to him. If you talk to him while holding both swords, he will take both of them. Drop one then talk to him. You will be done with the quest when you've given him the sword. Then, pick up the sword you dropped to keep your very own blurite sword.Reward Trivia Dragon Slayer  Dragon Slayer is considered to be the hardest quest for Free-to-play. However it gives good experience and abilities and is a must for moderate to high level non-members.Walkthrough  Talk to the Guildmaster in the Champions' Guild. Ask him for a quest, and he will tell you to talk to Oziach, who is located west of Edgeville and is very close to the wilderness. Oziach says that to be able to buy a rune platebody from him, you have to kill the dragon, Elvarg, located on Crandor Isle. You will need to obtain three pieces of the map to get to the island. He will tell you to go the the Guildmaster for information on how to kill Elvarg. Ask the Guildmaster about all three map pieces (make sure to ask about all three or you can't proceed with the other pieces) and he will give you the key to Melzar's maze.Obtaining an Anti-Dragon shield  Go to Lumbridge and talk to Duke Horacio in Lumbridge Castle. Ask him about a shield that will protect you from a dragon's fire breath. He will give you the Anti-dragon shield. Note that if you lose your current shield, you can talk to him again to get another. You can also get multiple shields at one time by talking to him, getting one, dropping it, and then talking to him again.Obtaining the Map Pieces  These map pieces may be obtained in any order. When you have all three, use any piece on any other piece to form the complete Crandor map.First Map Piece  The first piece is found in Melzar's Maze south of the Crafting Guild. Bring some food and armour to fight a lesser demon. Use the maze key on the door then do the following stages. Kill some giant rats until they drop a Red key. ZOMBIE RATS ALSO DROP THE KEY Use it on the north-west door, then go up the ladder. Kill the ghosts until you get an Orange key, THIS COULD TAKE UP TO 20 MINUTES DO NOT FRET, then enter the door second from the north. Then go up the ladder. Kill the skeletons until you get a Yellow key, then use it on the southwest door. Kill zombies until you get a Blue key. use on north-west door Kill Melzar the Mad, but be cautious as he attacks players with magic, using fire strikes and weakening you. He will drop a key. Use his key on the door to the Lesser Demon. Kill the Lesser Demons until you get the green key (There is a safe spot behind one of the wooden boxes). Use it on the door and grab that piece of map from the chest. Recommended for players focused on melee: Silverlight because it has the power of a longsword against demon based monsters. Recommended for rangers: At least a Maple longbow with Steel arrows. Recommended for Mages: At least bolt-class spells. If you plan on defeating the demon via Ranged or Magic, you should be near the exit door because you can get him, but he can't get you. There is another method if you prefer to use melee. using a two-space weapon, such as a Halberd. While having run on, lure the demon towards the door. The run around and go to the space near the corner of the wall and next to the sack. This will get the demon stuck on the other side. Then run back around to the door. If you then choose the option to attack him from the door, your player should walk around and attack the demon, but the demon won't attack you. Now you're done here with Melzar's Maze. Tip:Look at Melzar's Maze for further information.Second Map Piece  To obtain this piece, you'll need an unfired bowl, whether it be bought or created with the Crafting skill, a Wizard's Mind Bomb, which can be bought in Falador for 3 coins, a lobster pot, which can be bought in Port Sarim, and a piece of silk, which can be bought in Al Kharid, and also in Varrock in Thessalia's. When you have all these items, talk to the Oracle, who is located on Ice Mountain. Then, when the Oracle is done talking, go into the Dwarven Mine with all those items. Look for a door in the northeast part of the mines. It is just north of the area with the scorpions. When you've found it, use all the items on the door, be sure to use the Wizard's Mind Bomb with the door, as the left-click action for it is to drink it. They will disappear after usage. If you hadn't spoken with the Oracle, when you put something in the door it will say \"I have no idea what I should put in the opening of this door. Maybe I should just leave it for now\". Open the chest and search for the second map piece.Third Map Piece  The third and final piece is obtained by doing one of two things. Both involve Wormbrain in Port Sarim jail. Note: in RuneScape Classic, Telekinetic Grab was the only way to get the third map piece after some quest items were made nontradeable. With all three map pieces, simply use two together and they will all combine into the treasure map.Multiple Map  It is possible to have multiple map after the quest. However when you are trying to combine the pieces of map, you MUST drop them to floor temporarily. If you bank the additional pieces, they will disappear after you combined the one on your hand.Obtaining a Ship  (note that you have to talk to the guild master before you can purchase the ship) You will need 6 steel bars, a hammer and 3 planks. Smith 6 steel bars into 90 steel nails, or you can buy them from the Guild Master in the Champions' Guild, General Store or other players. Next, get a hammer and 2,000 coins. Go to Port Sarim and look for Klarense, a sailor. He is located in the southern docks. He will sell you his boat named Lady Lumbridge for 2,000 coins. Pay him the 2,000 coins and the boat is now yours. Go on the ship and go inside it. Repair the hole in the ship by using the planks with the hole. Do this three times and the hole will be repaired. Next, go to Draynor Village and find Ned, the person who makes ropes for you. Bring your map. Ask him to be the captain and help sail you to Crandor. He will agree and tell you to meet him on your ship.The Fight  Now it is time to prepare. Bring three good items: your anti-dragon/dragonfire shield, a weapon and armour. The rest of your inventory should be filled with food; lobsters or swordfish would do. Swordfish (14hp) would be preferable even though they are more expensive than lobsters (12hp) and hard to obtain. Another good alternative is Meat or Anchovy pizzas as they can heal more than Swordfish. You can heal more per inventory slot though you need 2 bites to finish a pizza. A meat pizza heals 8 HP per bite (16hp in 2 bites) while an anchovy pizza heals 9 per bite (18 hp in 2 bites). This means that in general, pizzas would be better but you have less chance of surviving if the battle takes an unlucky turn. If you are a member, you can use monkfish (16 hp) or sharks (20 hp), or even a tuna potato (22 hp) although this may not be necessary. Go to your ship and sail to Crandor Isle. You shall experience a short cutscene, where Elvarg flies over your ship in circles and sets it on fire! Cabin Boy Jenkins starts to panic. He will catch on fire, taking 16 damage and dies. After crashing on the island, make your way through the island to the top, avoiding the monsters there. You'll see stairs behind some lesser demons. Run past them and go down the stairs. You will see a short cutscene of Elvarg coming towards you. You'll be in a cave surrounded by skeletons. Keep walking and you'll see Elvarg behind a short wall of spikes protruding from the ground. Climb over it, making sure that your anti-dragonfire shield is equipped. Fight Elvarg and defeat her. It is advised to use stab or crush attacks, with weapons such as swords, warhammers or battleaxes since Elvarg has slash resistance, so slash attacks are more likely to miss. It is still possible to do the quest with a slash weapon like a scimitar but is a little harder. Make sure you can still equip your anti-dragonfire shield or the fight will be over before you can get her to half health or even at least hitting her 3 times regardless of high healing food. Note: If for any reason you leave the island (death, restock on food, ect.) before killing Elvarg, you can return through the \"secret\" enterance (see below), or through Lady Lumbridge. If the latter is chosen, you will need to repair the ship again. However, you will not be able to sail back on Lady Lumbridge if you have found the \"secret\" enterance.Battle Strategies  For stab or crush attacks a adamant longsword/rune longsword is recommended (dont use a adamant battleaxe) . You could also use a rune battleaxe. Although it is NOT recommended that you use Magic, it's recommended that you use the fire bolt spell or higher. Using spells below bolt level is NOT recommended. It's also not a good idea to use magic because dragon hide is naturally strong against magic attacks. As always, equip the anti-dragonfire shield when fighting. Also bring teleportation runes just in case your health gets low and you have no food left. Spells that weaken Elvarg can help, but are not needed. It is recommended that you bring at least 50 of each rune if you are using the fire bolt spell. For lower level spells, bring more runes to cast. Remember to keep away from Elvarg's claws, they will do incredible damage without sufficient metal armour. Also, notice your prayer is slowly drained during combat, hence protection prayer would last shorter time. For players attacking Elvarg from a distance, there is a safe spot in the south-east area of her lair behind a wall of stalagmites. Although it is up to you to determine what fighting style best suits you, it is not recommended that you fight from far away with range or magic. Instead fight with melee as Elvarg's dragonfire hits higher than her melee attack. With the anti-dragon shield equipped, Elvarg`s max hit is 13, so remember to bring some food along. Elvarg may hit rapidly high with her dragonfire. If you are a level 50, Elvarg should be pretty easy if you have a full inventory of food like lobsters. Don't try and kill elvarg if you are lvl 40 or under its hard\u00a0:)Finishing up  You are not finished once you kill Elvarg. The quest has been extended a bit. After Killing Elvarg a cut scene will start of you ripping off the dragon's head. Elvarg's head must be taken back to Oziach in order to complete the quest.Getting Out  Run out of Elvarg's room and continue going south, avoiding skeletons and lesser demons. There is a \"secret\" wall in the way, which you can go through and end up in the Karamja volcano area. From then on, you can go back through the wall to train at Crandor Isle. Some players also exit first so they have an \"escape hatch\" ready if the fight should go badly. These are a few ways to get back to the mainland, once out of the dungeon:Reward Note  If a player tries to talk to Ned after he/she has sailed to Crandor (doesn't require completion of the quest) and asks the question \"How did you get back from Crandor?\", Ned will simply explain \"I got towed back by a passing friendly whale.\" though you can see Ned on top of the broken Lady Lumbridge even after completion of the quest.Trivia References Quest point  Quest points, often abbreviated as QP or QPS, are given to players after they complete quests and are a measure of their completion of quests in RuneScape. Players can receive anywhere from 1-6 quest points from completing any given quest. RuneScape Classic players can have up to 112 quest points. Meanwhile, Free-to-play players can get up to 40 quest points.Guilds  At 33 quest points, players can access the Champions' Guild, which is where to begin the ultimate free-to-play quest, Dragon Slayer.Trading & Trade Limits  On 2 January, Jagex introduced the trade limit system. The amount of quest points affected the difference in value players could trade. Players with over 200 quest points have the maximum trading limit of 30,000 coins. However this update does not affect the 3k trade limit in free-to-play worlds. A former member with 200 quest points has a 30k trade limit in a member's world, but once the player enters a free-to-play world, he/she would only have a 3k limit, just like everyone else. Below is the table of the trade limits in combination of quest points:Trivia See also Attack  Attack is a melee combat skill that determines accuracy of attacks. A player's Attack level is also a qualification for wielding certain melee weapons. Currently the minimum requirement to be ranked on the highscores for Attack is level 15. Since January 17th, 2012, there are 106,009 players with level 99 in Attack.Fighting accurately  Attack is trained with the \"Accurate\" attack style, accessed from the Combat Options menu. Most weapons have an option to train Accurately, although some cannot effectively train Attack. The \"Accurate\" attack style gives an invisible +3 bonus levels to Attack.Experience  If a player hits an opponent, the damage dealt is multiplied by 0.4 and that amount of experience is given to the Attack skill. For example, if a player hits a 1, then they will receive 0.4 Attack experience. Exp = 0.4x Some experience is also given to a player's Hitpoints level when they deal damage. If a player hits an opponent, whatever damage they deal is multiplied by 1.33 and given to their Hitpoints. For example, if a player hits a 1, then they will receive 1.33 Hitpoints experience, in addition to the 4 experience in attack. Exp = 1.33x If a player fights with the \"controlled\" attack style, then their damage dealt is multiplied by 1.33 and given to the player's Attack, Strength, Defence, and Hitpoints level.Combat training (dummies)  Players with an attack level of 1 and above can train on dummies at Lumbridge. Players with an attack level of 7 or lower can train on dummies at Varrock. Dummies are sandbags which players can hit and not risk being dealt damage. Striking a dummy gives 5.2 Attack experience, but does not give Hitpoints experience. Dummies can be found in various places across RuneScape, though the most popular place is north of Varrock's east bank, and most recently the tutor building in Lumbridge.Attack bonuses  Almost all weapons give players \"attack bonuses\" to certain attack types. These bonuses can be seen in the equipment menu, to the right of the inventory menu. Attack bonuses give players advantages as well as disadvantages in combat.Other attack bonuses Levels  Levels needed to wield different types of weapons are as follows: Note that corrupt dragon weapons are the strongest best but degrade to dust very quickly.Temporary boosts Witch's Potion Walkthrough  This is one of the easiest quests that exist. You should have no problem with this, no matter what level you are. Hetty Talk to Hetty and tell her you want to know more about the black arts. She will tell you she needs four ingredients.

And Junon Planet began to receive more attention from Arua, than all the other planets. This was unprecedented amongst the Gods and Goddesses, who were all to be equal in Arua\u2019s eyes. But soon, it became quite clear\u2026 Arua\u2019s favoritism towards Junon was apparently due to her falling in love. Arua, who had created the universe from love, was finally receiving some back; from the God of Adventure, Junon, who fell madly in love with the Goddess of Life and Souls almost immediately after his own creation and of the other Gods and Goddesses. She is the Goddess of Life and Souls so she is most powerful. If the gods would rebel, they all would have been helpless against her. Hebarn, the God of Darkness and Secrets, became jealous of the divine affair instantly; and demanded that Junon\u2019s love cease, so that Arua may belong to all the lesser Gods and Goddesses equally (Arua created the other Gods and Goddesses, that is why they are lesser). But Skaaj, the Goddess of Love, could not deny the veracity of the love\u2019s power; and she blessed Junon\u2019s and Arua\u2019s conjugation herself, making it official above all other matters in the universe. Hebarn was both furious and envious at these turn of events, for his own love for Luna, the Goddess of Magic had been ignored completely by Skaaj in the past. Skaaj never officiated anything because Luna, in charge of the cold and icy second planet of Luna, never reciprocated the love to Hebarn. It was after this that Hebarn became also known as the God of Jealousy and Envy. The Dark God soon exiled himself from the other deities, vowing revenge against Arua\u2019s love and distancing the planet Hebarn from the rest of the universe: \u201cIf there can be love only from light, let there be hatred bourne from the darkness.\u201d Hebarn will soon strike the six other planets himself.

They are similar to regular shooting games, but focus more on weaving through complex patterns containing anywhere from dozens to hundreds of bullets. Every game in the Touhou series is set in the fantasy land of Gensokyo, and the series is known for its huge cast of characters, well-developed storylines, and related materials such as music CDs, fan-made comics and animated videos made to the music.

As the sole maiden of the Hakurei Shrine, she is commonly called upon (or calls it upon herself) to investigate strange occurrences throughout Gensokyo. In earlier games, Reimu's spiritual abilities were highly limited. (In Highly Responsive to Prayers, she was unable to directly harm enemies at all.) As time passed, however, she developed her abilities, becoming able to manipulate the Hakurei Yin-Yang Orb, special amulets, and her own spiritual power to fight more effectively. Sometime between Mystic Square and Embodiment of Scarlet Devil, she realized the ability to fly under her own jurisdiction. (Before then, she relied on Genjii, her turtle familiar, to fly.) Reimu is commonly described as easygoing, curious, dutiful, and optimistic \u2014 sometimes overly so. Her personality seems sympathetic toward many individuals; there are few characters who remain her rivals past the first encounter. Her shrine has become a moderately popular locale for some of Gensokyo's residents.Touhou Hisoutensoku  \u6771\u65b9\u975e\u60f3\u5929\u5247\u3000\uff5e \u8d85\u5f29\u7d1a\u30ae\u30cb\u30e7\u30eb\u306e\u8b0e\u3092\u8ffd\u3048 (romanized: Touhou Hisoutensoku ~ Choudokyuu Ginyoru no Nazo wo Oe, lit. \"Lacking Perception of the Natural Laws of the East\" or \"Lacking Perception of the Rule of Heaven in the East\" ~ Chase the Enigma of the Superdreadnought Guignol\") is a standalone expansion pack to the fighting spinoff Scarlet Weather Rhapsody with five new characters, first released by Tasogare Frontier at Comiket 76.  Combining this expansion with an installation of Scarlet Weather Rhapsody allows for the use of additional Touhou characters within the new expansion. Like its predecessors, Immaterial and Missing Power and Scarlet Weather Rhapsody, Touhou Hisoutensoku is a collaboration between ZUN and Tasogare Frontier. Tasogare Frontier is well-known for games such as Eternal Fighter Zero, Immaterial and Missing Power and Scarlet Weather Rhapsody.Gameplay  Touhou Hisoutensoku retains the same mechanics of spell cards, spirit orbs, and weather as Scarlet Weather Rhapsody, but also introduces new playable Touhou characters, spell cards, and weather-types. Many existing spell cards, weather-types and graphics from Scarlet Weather Rhapsody have been altered and in addition to the new characters, existing characters all have new spell card moves. Additionally, each playable character now has a system card (e.g. healing, weather change, bombs, etc.) associated with her that's usable by any character once unlocked.Story  A mysterious giant is seen wandering around Gensokyo. It can suddenly appear and can just as suddenly vanish seemingly without a trace. Everyone who sees it becomes curious and wonders about the truth behind this strange sight. Sanae Kochiya, Cirno, and Hong Meiling each have their own fears and dreams about the giant, and each sets out in pursuit of this roaming behemoth. Exploring the Forest of Magic, the Scarlet Devil Mansion, and other locations in Gensokyo, the heroines face many challenges and obstacles in their pursuit of a mystery that's far deeper than it first appears.Additional information External Links  Official UnofficialMarisa Kirisame Main Profile  Marisa Kirisame is a human magician, and is one of the most important sub-characters of the series (according to series producer ZUN). Her personality is sometimes described as disagreeable, but in some other titles, straightforward. Either way, she is a very self-confident person that likes to stick her nose into every trouble out of curiosity. During the events of Story of Eastern Wonderland, she made her first appearance as a minion of Mima, to prevent Reimu from reaching her boss, but was defeated. Since then, she has appeared in all but one title of the Touhou series (and some non-Touhou titles too), usually sided with Reimu, but sometimes against her. She is also known as a hard worker, who's trying to catch up to Reimu with her secret training and magic development. That makes a good contrast to other humans appearing in the series, most of them have some kind of natural born talent (Reimu) or ability (Sakuya). So she is sometimes referred as the \"most human-ish human\" in the series. Marisa is the author of The Grimoire of Marisa, a collection of notes about spellcards used by her and other danmaku users she has encountered.Flandre Scarlet Main Profile  Flandre Scarlet\u00a0is the younger sister of\u00a0Remilia Scarlet\u00a0and a\u00a0vampire who has lived at the\u00a0Scarlet Devil Mansion\u00a0for over 495 years. She is also an antagonist of the series. Flandre first appeared as the Extra\u00a0Stage\u00a0boss\u00a0of\u00a0Embodiment of Scarlet Devil. Flandre has lived for at least 495 years, but since she goes a little crazy (due to emotional instability), she has never been taken outside the bounds of the\u00a0Scarlet Devil Mansion, or rarely leaves the building itself,\u00a0and as she herself never tried going outside for the respect she has to her sister, she was raised knowing nothing about the outside world. However, she has shown a desire to go outside after witnessing the events of\u00a0Embodiment of Scarlet Devil. Her initial attempt to do so was blocked by\u00a0Patchouli Knowledge's rain summoning magic. In the first place, until the time when she met either\u00a0Marisa Kirisame\u00a0or\u00a0Reimu Hakurei\u00a0in\u00a0Embodiment of Scarlet Devil, she has not seen any\u00a0humans\u00a0other than in cooked form.Personality  Flandre is normally nice and quiet. She was described as \"rather nuts\", and although she doesn't often get angry, she is quite strange, which makes it difficult for others to understand her.Abilities  Flandre possesses superhuman capabilities just like\u00a0Remilia Scarlet, such as enhanced physical strength, with the destructive power of\u00a0oni\u00a0and the nimbleness of\u00a0tengu, as well as a\u00a0vampire's bodily and regenerative ability. She can swing an oversized sword, thought not as quickly as she would like to. Since she doesn't know the proper way to attack humans, she is unable to go easy on them and blows them away without a trace. Flandre can destroy anything she wants, which is truly a frightening ability with no real weaknesses. By moving the \"eye\" of the object, where the tension is highest, and by attacking this eye, she is able to destroy the target. She is able to move the \"eye\" of anything into the middle of her hand, then she pours her power into it or in other words, she crushes the \"eye\" and unconditionally destroys the target with just a squeeze.\u00a0She states that everything has an \"eye\" and that she has those \"eyes\" in her hand. This usage of ability was never shown other than in\u00a0Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red. Everything that is made for her to play with ends up broken, which may mean why she doesn't have many playmates, to which it's recommended to never meet with her. Flandre is able to clone herself as seen in one of her\u00a0spell cards, where she creates 3 clones that helps her in the battle. The clones\u00a0attack as they like\u00a0which could mean they're able to think independently to some grade.Possessions  In her hand, she possesses an object that looks like a crooked clock needle (sometimes thought to be a\u00a0L\u00e6vateinn) \u2013 this is a prominent peculiarity associated with Flandre, in which the name is derived from her second\u00a0spell card\u00a0Taboo \"L\u00e6vateinn\". It shares its name with the sword (wand in some versions) of\u00a0Loki, a Norse god known for causing mischief. She also possesses unusually peculiar wings, an irregular shape unlike those of any living creature,\u00a0youkai\u00a0or\u00a0ghost,\u00a0or even to a\u00a0vampire's typical bat-like wings (or even organic matter). Reimu even said, \"I doubt she can fly with those wings\".Undefined Fantastic Object  \u6771\u65b9\u661f\u84ee\u8239 \uff5e Undefined Fantastic Object (romanized: Touhou Seirensen, meaning \"Star-Lotus Ship of the East\") is the twelfth official game of the Touhou series. A trial version of the game was released at Reitaisai 6 in March 2009, and the full game was released at Comiket 76 in August 2009 and hit stores on September 11, 2009.Gameplay  Undefined Fantastic Object features three playable characters (Reimu, Marisa and Sanae), each with two weapon types. The weapon types are often denoted A and B. In total the player can choose between 6 different ways to start UFO. However, unlike Mountain of Faith and Subterranean Animism, the spell card (bombing) system from the older games (such as Perfect Cherry Blossom and Imperishable Night) has been reintroduced. The gameplay system unique to Undefined Fantastic Object comes this time in the form of colored UFOs. Certain enemies will drop a UFO on destruction, which the player can collect for different effects. By utilizing this system, the player can receive more bombs, life pieces, or point bonuses.Story  Rumors have been spreading throughout Gensokyo since early spring about a strange flying treasure ship. Figuring there must be something up there regardless of the rumor itself, and aided by Sanae Kochiya, the girls take off into the air to find it and plunder its treasures. During the high-speed chase of the \"UFO\", the player confronts Nazrin, who has come from the flying object and is looking for something in particular. She insists that there is no treasure ship at all. After that, the player runs into Kogasa Tatara, whose role is nothing else but to scare the girls. As the player finally catches up to the ship, Ichirin Kumoi and her familiar Unzan appear, complaining that all sorts of fairies and humans have been pestering them. She explains that the ship isn't a \"ship\" at all, but rather some kind of remodeled building given the power of flight. She also mentions that she's trying to revive a certain someone. The fragments - the UFOs that the player has been collecting - are necessary for this purpose, but rather than handing them over, the player instead defeats the pair and enters the ship. Inside, the player runs into a strange flying object that promptly attacks, then leaves items. Disregarding this, the player then finds Captain Murasa, the youkai ghost captain of the ship. She tells the player that the ship is headed for Hokkai, located on the outer edges of Makai, a world connected to Gensokyo. Since the player entered with enough fragments in their possession, the ship has already begun to enter Hokkai. Before very long, just outside Hokkai, the player runs into Nazrin again, who has found what she was looking for - the Bishamonten pagoda. After defeating her a second time, Shou Toramaru appears. Now that both the pagoda and the fragments are together, the revival can begin. Shou tells the player that they are trying to revive a \"saint\" who has been sealed for many years - a person who helped both humans and youkai, and was punished because of it. After defeating Shou, the player opts to help revive this person, since they're already there and everything. The final confrontation happens deep inside Hokkai, where Byakuren Hijiri has been unsealed. The player's job is to exterminate youkai(or, in Marisa's case, to prioritize protecting humans), so Byakuren disagrees - she is an ally to both, and treats both equally. The player defeats Byakuren in a long battle, and the story ends on peaceful terms, as she and Murasa cruise around Gensokyo in the ship for a while before settling down and rebuilding Byakuren's original temple. However, the mystery of the UFOs hasn't yet been solved. Marisa discovers that upon opening one of them, a snake comes out and the UFO turns into a piece of wood. The girls take off once again into the night sky to figure out what's going on. Kogasa reappears in the process, again attempting to surprise the player. After that, the strange flying object appears again and transforms into a youkai named Nue Houjuu, who was the one that disguised the fragments. Apparently the player was the only one who saw the UFOs as UFOs - the enemies the player fought against knew that they were actually pieces of the ship. After defeating her, she explains that she was originally just trying to mess with Murasa's efforts to revive Byakuren, but the player caught her interest, so she ended up helping the player out too.Additional Information External links  Official UnofficialScarlet Weather Rhapsody  \u6771\u65b9\u7dcb\u60f3\u5929 \uff5e Scarlet Weather Rhapsody (romanized: Touhou Hisouten, meaning Eastern Skies of Scarlet  Perceptions) chronologically takes place about 1 year after Mountain of Faith (TH10). Henceforth it is referred to as TH10.5. Like its predecessor, Immaterial and Missing Power, Scarlet Weather Rhapsody is a collaboration between ZUN and Tasogare Frontier. Tasogare Frontier is well-known for games such as Eternal Fighter Zero and Immaterial and Missing Power. Scarlet Weather Rhapsody debuted at Reitaisai 4, with a playable demo available to patrons. A demo was released at C72, and an updated demo was released online on April 29, 2008. The full version was released at Reitaisai 5 on May 25, 2008.Gameplay  As with Immaterial and Missing Power, Scarlet Weather Rhapsody is a fighting game featuring a variety of Touhou Project characters. It appears to be similar in many ways to its predecessor, with many similar sprites and attacks. However, the inclusion of a new weather system that can affect the tides of battle, a 20 card deck system, and the implementation of flight marks a vast difference in gameplay between IaMP and its successor.Story  A bizarre phenomenon is occurring in Gensokyo. In the middle of summer, untimely rain and hail fall in the Forest of Magic, snow blankets Hakugyokurou, the Scarlet Devil Mansion is enveloped in a cloudy, dense haze, and the Hakurei Shrine is leveled by a sudden earthquake. Throughout the game, Reimu and the other protagonists set out to investigate the source of the strange occurrences. Tenshi Hinanai is a celestial. Finding her newfound life in Heaven boring and monotonous, she enviously saw the youkai of Gensokyo stirring many incidents from above. Wielding the power to control the earth and the divine Sword of Hisou, the jaded celestial decides to instigate a catastrophe of her own.Additional information External Links Embodiment of Scarlet Devil  \u6771\u65b9\u7d05\u9b54\u90f7\u3000\uff5e the Embodiment of Scarlet Devil (romanized: Touhou Koumakyou, meaning Eastern Lands of the Scarlet Devil) is a challenging vertical-scrolling shooter, and is the sixth official game of the Touhou series. It is the first to be released specifically for the Windows OS. The game takes place in the mystic oriental land of Gensokyo, as usual. The story revolves around the appearance of a thick red mist, that has covered the land and blocked out the sun. Playing as either Reimu Hakurei (a shrine maiden) or Marisa Kirisame (a playful magician), you must battle your way through 6 difficult stages toward the source of the red mist, and face the \"Scarlet Devil\" behind it all.Gameplay  Embodiment of Scarlet Devil features two different playable characters to choose from, with two different Spell Card types each. Reimu Hakurei can cover a wide area of the screen with weaker attacks, while Marisa Kirisame relies on her speed and power to make up for her thinner attack spread. The bombs (Spell Cards) also show different behavior and damage depending on the character and type chosen. Some important gameplay features that Embodiment of Scarlet Devil introduces over its predecessor Mystic Square are \"automatic item collection\" which allows you to collect all items on screen by moving to the top of the screen if you are at full power, and a counter-bomb system, which allows you to negate an enemy hit by pressing the bomb button within a short reaction time immediately after.Story  During a peaceful summer in Gensokyo, an unnatural scarlet mist appears without warning and covers much of the land. It is strong enough to block out the sun, causing the affected areas to become dark and cold. Reimu Hakurei, a shrine maiden working at the Hakurei Shrine, feels it is a shrine maiden's duty to find the cause of this unnatural weather. Marisa Kirisame, a magician, hopes that the person casting the spell will have some interesting items to collect. Depending on who you choose, only one of these two heroines actually goes out and investigates. The heroine travels toward the island of a lake where the mist seems to originate from. Before reaching her destination, the heroine is intercepted by Rumia, who was traveling by the lake's edge, and then Cirno, who called the lake her home. However, Rumia and Cirno were not related to the source of the mist. Upon reaching the island, the heroine is immediately attacked by many guards. The offensive is led by Hong Meiling, who is unsuccessful in driving away the intruding heroine from the premises. After the fight, the heroine enters the Scarlet Devil Mansion, certain that the person causing the mist is inside. The heroine first looks through a dim library, where Patchouli Knowledge tries to stop the heroine from proceeding any further. The heroine then reaches the main hallways, where the chief maid Sakuya Izayoi also tries to stop the heroine from reaching her mistress. After the long journey, the heroine comes face to face with the Scarlet Devil herself, Remilia Scarlet, on the balcony of the Scarlet Devil Mansion. Remilia reveals that the scarlet mist was created so that she could feel comfortable walking out during the day. After a fierce battle, Remilia is defeated and things return to relative normality in Gensokyo. A few days later, the heroine returns to the Scarlet Devil Mansion during Remilia's absence and finds the entire household in chaos. Making her way to the main hallways, the heroine fights a stronger maid staff than before, as well as a much stronger version of Patchouli. As the heroine wonders why everyone is on edge, Remilia's little sister, Flandre Scarlet, appears. Flandre reveals that she has been hidden inside the mansion for 495 years, and she has never seen a human before. Flandre asks the heroine to play with her, and after a long and difficult battle, Flandre is defeated.Additional information External links Yukari Yakumo Main Profile  An often seen and referenced character, Yukari Yakumo is the youkai of boundaries. She was first introduced in Perfect Cherry Blossom as the sleepy mistress of Ran Yakumo. During Imperishable Night, Yukari teams up with Reimu to find those responsible for the fake moon. In Immaterial and Missing Power, she actually sings her way from battle to battle, stealing everyone's sake, wine, and brandy. Even right from the shrine's altar... however, this is all part of her strategy to save the day. Somehow. Over a thousand years ago, Yukari organized an army of youkai and led them in an invasion of the Moon. The youkai were subsequently routed by the Lunarians, who possessed superior technology and magic, and forced to retreat to Earth. Since that time, no youkai have attempted to expand their territory beyond Gensokyo. While some speculate that Yukari organized the invasion out of selfish hunger for territory and power, others believe she did it to teach the youkai a lesson about starting wars of conquest; namely, that it was a bad idea. About a thousand years ago, Yukari met and became friends with a human girl named Yuyuko. After Yuyuko died, Yukari continued to be friends with Yuyuko's ghost, although Yuyuko gradually forgot who she had been and why she had died. When Yuyuko requested that Yukari use her power to weaken the border between the Netherworld and Gensokyo, Yukari obliged. She knew Yuyuko's plan to make the Saigyou Ayakashi bloom could never succeed, but was too busy sleeping to say or do anything about it, or to put the border back to normal after everything was finished, which put her on a collision course with the heroines. Yukari is known for being a very youkai-like youkai who sleeps all day and lives for the enjoyment of life. Though she rarely leaves her house, she's well-connected and is acquainted with most of the most powerful youkai (such as Suika and Yuyuko) as well as anyone having anything to do with the Hakurei border or outside world (Reimu and Rinnosuke). She's possibly the most powerful youkai in Gensokyo, and has a tendency to toy with her opponents rather than use her full power from the start. If anyone is suited for the role of \"mastermind\", it's Yukari; she often has a great deal of insight and understanding about whatever happens in Gensokyo, and possesses considerable intellectual prowess as well. Though she seems flaky and unreliable most of the time, when the safety or security of Gensokyo is at stake, she won't hesitate to get involved, even if it means using others to do the work for her. For example, in Scarlet Weather Rhapsody, she treats Tenshi Hinanawi with much hostility after finding out the plot of the Heavens. She could easily be either a villain or a heroine, depending on her whims.Subterranean Animism  \u6771\u65b9\u5730\u970a\u6bbf\u3000\uff5e Subterranean Animism (romanized: Touhou Chireiden, meaning Eastern Palace of the Earth Spirits) is the eleventh official game of the Touhou series. The original trial version was released at Reitaisai 5, while the full version debuted at Comiket 74.Gameplay  Subterranean Animism features two playable characters (Reimu and Marisa), each with three weapon types representing a youkai assisting them from above ground. Like Mountain of Faith, collecting power items adds up to four \"option\" satellites around the character (or eight for the Marisa/Alice combination), which behave differently according to the character and weapon type, and can be sacrificed for a bomb effect. However, unlike Mountain of Faith, each bomb has a different behavior, and some cause special gameplay effects to occur. The scoring system is once again based on grazing, coupled with collection of two types of items dropped by enemies. Overall, the system resembles some of the core elements of Embodiment of Scarlet Devil fused together with the Tension Bonus System from Shikigami no Shiro series. As such, the player is urged to actively graze at every possible opportunity in order to increase the point item value. Grazing large amounts of bullets in little time is rewarded by the temporary effect of autocollecting all the freefalling items at their maximum value (identical to the point of collection effect, but without regard to the character's location on the screen), letting the player concentrate entirely on the act of dodging bullets.Story  One day in Gensokyo, all of a sudden, there were lots of evil spirits going around. Reimu Hakurei, a Shrine Maiden and Marisa Kirisame, a black-clothed Magician were getting suspicious. They go into the underground to ask them to stop driving them to Gensokyo's surface. Depending on who you choose, one of them goes out to investigate. The heroine starts to head underground, but runs into a Tsuchigumo, Yamame Kurodani who tries to stop the heroine from continuing. Yamame is quickly defeated and the heroine moves on. She moved on to a bridge leading to the Ancient City but runs into the bridge guard of jealousy, Parsee Mizuhashi, who also tries to stop the heroine from proceeding. Parsee is obviously defeated, and the heroine continues to go into the Ancient City. The Ancient City is populated by Oni ,therefore, encountering Yuugi Hoshiguma. After defeating Yuugi as a midboss, Yuugi starts following the heroine while shooting Danmaku. After, they battle and the heroine is victorious. Yuugi tells the heroine where the Palace of the Earth Spirits is. The heroine enters the Palace of the Earth Spirits and a cat is seen following the heroine. Later, the heroine meets the Master of the Palace of the Earth Spirits, Satori Komeiji. After Satori is defeated, she permits the heroine to go through to talk to her pets. The heroine proceeds to a much hotter place. She runs into a cat, Rin Kaenbyou. The cat transforms into her youkai form and is surprised to see a human make it all the way here. Rin tries to stop the heroine from proceeding to whom she describes as the most dangerous bird underground. Though, Rin is defeated. The heroine finally reaches somewhere even hotter than the place before. She makes her way but encounters Rin again. Rin states that if the heroine dies, she'll burn so hard she won't even leave any ashes. Rin attacks the heroine again, but is defeated. The heroine finally reaches Utsuho Reiuji, the most dangerous bird underground. Utsuho ate the god, Yatagarasu and claimed the nuclear powers. Utsuho states that with these powerful nuclear powers, she will take over the world above, which what made Rin Kaenbyou worried that she sent evil spirits into the world above. The heroine defeats Utsuho to stop her plan from taking over Gensokyo. After Utsuho's defeat, she states that it was Kanako Yasaka that whispered to her about swallowing Yatagarasu. Some time after that, the heroine decides to pay a visit to the Moriya Shrine to find out more. While trying to find Kanako, she encounters Sanae Kochiya. Sanae is defeated and the heroine moves on until they suddenly found Satori Komeiji's little sister, Koishi Komeiji. Koishi asked where the goddess of the shrine is, but the heroine tells Koishi that they were actually doing the same. Koishi states that she went from all the way from the underground to up in the world above to visit this shrine. Koishi learnt that the heroine defeated her older sister, Satori. Koishi asked to fight the heroine because she was able to defeat Utsuho, so it must mean the heroine is stronger. After Koishi is defeated, on Reimu's story, Suwako Moriya, Moriya Shrine's true goddess appears. According to Suwako, Kanako is on a shopping trip. Apparently, Koishi wanted a gloomy power of love for her pets. For Marisa's story, after Koishi is defeated, Sanae Kochiya, a Shrine Maiden of the Moriya Shrine tells Koishi and Marisa that Suwako and Kanako are currently out.Additional Information External links  Official UnofficialImperishable Night  \u6771\u65b9\u6c38\u591c\u6284\u3000\uff5e Imperishable Night (romanized: Touhou Eiyashou, meaning Eternal Night Vignette from the East) is the eighth official game of the Touhou series. It is the third to be released specifically for the Windows OS. The game takes place in the mystic oriental land of Gensokyo. Someone has replaced the real moon with a fake moon that can never become full. Playing as one of 4 human/youkai teams, you must battle your way through 6 difficult stages in search of the full moon and face the one responsible for its disappearance.Gameplay  Imperishable Night features a total of eight playable characters, in pre-set pairs (and later, individually). The pairs work in tandem: one person fires when unfocused, while the other pops in and fires when focused, with a reduction in movement speed. The two attacks can be drastically different. The individual characters do not have an attack change when focused, with the exception of Remilia. Quite a few smaller details are unique to this game, including Last Spells - for an enemy, a Last Spell is a bonus Spell Card which the player can tackle without fear of losing lives/bombs. On the player side, Last Spells are secondary \"bomb\" Spell Cards, which last longer/do much more damage at the expense of two bomb stocks. There is a gauge which tracks how human/youkai (normal/focused) you are, as well as a new \"Time\" system, which affects gameplay.Story  It's the eve of the Harvest Moon Festival in Gensokyo when youkai sense that something is wrong with the moon. It appears that the moon has been replaced by a fake one. Someone must freeze time and find the real moon to ensure a full moon on the night of the festival. A human and youkai team set off along a forest path to investigate. Along the way, they encounter a firefly (Wriggle Nightbug) and a night sparrow (Mystia Lorelei), who are quickly defeated. Next, they meet a half-beast (Keine Kamishirasawa) who is protecting a Human Village from youkai. She mistakes the team for enemies and attacks them. After the team defeats her, Keine indicates that the person who switched the moons is in the bamboo forest. In the bamboo forest, they encounter a character (either Reimu or Marisa) who demands to know why the team has been freezing time and causing an imperishable night. Finally the team reaches the mansion of the perpetrator. But once inside, they find that the mansion is guarded by a pair of rabbits (Tewi and Reisen). The rabbits are defeated, but not before disorienting the team. Confused, the team must choose which path to take (one leads to the real moon and the other leads to the fake moon). After choosing the wrong path, they were able to meet a town pharmacist named Eirin. Eirin had attempted to seal the passage between the Moon and Earth. After picking the right path, they are able to meet the perpetrator of this mischievous scheme, Kaguya. Kaguya is a moon princess in hiding who has taken the real moon in order to sever the link between the earth and the moon. The team restores the real moon and Kaguya challenges them to face the \"5 impossible requests.\" Having completed the 5 impossible requests, the team is given another challenge by Kaguya: assassinate her rival, Mokou. With the full moon in place, all the enemies become much stronger and Keine becomes a hakutaku. Nevertheless the team prevails, proving that the player controlling them is indeed skillful and probably hopelessly addicted to Touhou games.Additional information External links Alice Margatroid Main Profile  Alice Margatroid is one of only a few people known to live within the Forest of Magic. She's a magician known primarily for her skillful use of dolls as well as being a loner. She gets in many fights with Marisa but they are somewhat acquaintances, sharing many of the same interests and even teaming up during Imperishable Night and Subterranean Animism. During Mystic Square, as a stage 3 boss, she attempted to prevent the heroine from proceeding. After the events she returns as the extra stage boss. Because Alice had learnt new types of magic from the grimoire, it is likely she became a youkai before the second encounter due to the high level magic. Nevertheless, she was still defeated. However, her dialogue with Reimu in stage 3 suggests that species changed before her appearance in the series. In Immaterial and Missing Power the vast majority of her attacks involved dolls in one way or another, either attacking for her or being used as explosives. She is a doll specialist, but dolls are more like a hobby in comparison to her full power. Alice is always seen with a locked grimoire in her hands, which is thought to be the same \"Grimoire of Alice\" that she fought the protagonist with as the Mystic Square Extra Boss. Because Alice, unlike Marisa, is much more interested in strategy and hates having to win a fight from sheer overwhelming power, she always holds back even if it means losing. In Unthinkable Natural Law she creates a giant doll and tests it in battle against Cirno at the end of the latter's Story Mode. Later, her Giant Doll became an urban legend.List by Groups  ATTENTION: Please follow this page or use this template when creating a page for an album.(Symbol) =NeutraL=  ---\n This lists this group's releases as =NeutraL=.

of the Scarlet Devil Mansion, the mistress of Sakuya and Meiling, and the older sister (and guardian) of Flandre. Though her appearance (and often behavior) is childlike, and seems nonthreatening, she has fearsome magical powers and a reputation to match, being known throughout Gensokyo as the dangerous \"Scarlet Devil.\" Like all vampires she is photosensitive and weakens when exposed to sunlight, so she typically remains inside her mansion (which has few windows to prevent light getting in) during the day and emerges during the night. While she is naturally known to drink human blood, her light appetite means her victims almost never die from their wounds. While her behavior is usually self-centered and somewhat bratty, it is possible to befriend her, however, humans and youkai alike prefer to avoid her. Her name, appearance, house, and clothing all indicate she is European in origin and emigrated to Japan many years ago (Her reason is unknown). She claims to be a descendant of the world's most notorious vampire, Count Vlad \u0162epe\u015f Dracul, but this is a bald-faced lie.Story  In Embodiment of Scarlet Devil, Remilia decided to release a mist over Gensokyo to block out the sun and let her move freely during the day; after her scheme was discovered and halted, she was forced to use a parasol to shade herself when she wanted to move around during daylight hours (as mentioned in Immaterial and Missing Power). In Imperishable Night she headed out to punish the ones who took the full moon from the night sky since the fighting would be at night. In Scarlet Weather Rhapsody, she settles her \"own\" investigation by ordering Sakuya to drag the suspects to her, in order to find the culprit, figuring later that the culprit is above the mountains, where she is very prone to the light. In Silent Sinner in Blue, she built a rocket to get to the moon.Perfect Cherry Blossom  \u6771\u65b9\u5996\u3005\u5922\u3000\uff5e Perfect Cherry Blossom (romanized: Touhou Youyoumu, meaning Bewitching Eastern Dream) is a challenging vertical-scrolling shooter, and is the seventh official game in the Touhou series. The game takes place in the mystic oriental land of Gensokyo, as usual. In the game's scenario, May has already begun, yet the winter storms show no signs of stopping just yet. Playing as either Reimu Hakurei (a shrine maiden), Marisa Kirisame (a playful magician) or Sakuya Izayoi (the head maid from Embodiment of Scarlet Devil), you must battle your way through 6 difficult stages and 2 unlockable extra stages into the depths of the Netherworld to uncover the truth behind the stolen spring.Gameplay  Perfect Cherry Blossom features three different playable characters to choose from, with two different Spell Card types each. Reimu Hakurei can weave through the smallest gaps with ease, and her attacks deal low to decent damage, depending on which type you use. Marisa Kirisame relies on her speed and power to compensate for her thin attack area, but the amount of power she wields is very considerable. Sakuya Izayoi has even wider and more versatile attacks than Reimu, but can be quite tricky to use and maneuver. The largest change Perfect Cherry Blossom introduces over its predecessor Embodiment of Scarlet Devil is the addition of the \"Cherry\" scoring system. Almost every part of the game is linked with the \"Cherry Meter\": shooting enemies increases your Cherry points, bombing or dying decreases your Cherry points, reaching 50,000 Cherry+ points gives you a temporary shield. The higher the Cherry Gauge becomes, the more points you gain from Point Items. Other important gameplay changes introduced in Perfect Cherry Blossom are the appearance of your character's hitbox while you are focused, a change in the properties of your attacks depending on whether you are normal or focused, and a helpful cursor on the bottom margin during a boss battle which tells you where the boss is currently located.Story  In Gensokyo, people relax and bask in the calm of a winter without end. Spring has shown no sign of arriving even though it's already May, and in fact the snowstorms are continually getting worse. Reimu Hakurei, a shrine maiden of the Hakurei Shrine, is tired of being cold day in and day out and wants to find the source of this unnatural weather. Marisa Kirisame, a black-clothed magician, sees a cherry blossom petal float down outside her warm house and wonders if spring is happening somewhere else. Sakuya Izayoi, the chief maid of the Scarlet Devil Mansion, knows that their winter supplies are diminishing quickly, and wants to end this prolonged winter before they run out completely. Depending on who you choose, only one of these three heroines actually goes out and investigates. The heroine starts off her journey by heading off into the snow-covered forests in search of clues. She battles the ice fairy Cirno and the winter spirit Letty Whiterock in the forest, and the nekomata Chen in the village of Mayohiga, without any progress in her search. Finally, after defeating Alice Margatroid and her dolls, the heroine finds a lead when she notices several cherry blossoms blowing around in the sky. The heroine follows the trail of cherry blossoms high above Gensokyo, breaking through the greetings of Lily White, eventually reaching a great magical boundary and the poltergeist musicians Prismriver Sisters (Lunasa, Merlin, and Lyrica). After silencing the Prismriver Sisters, the heroine crosses the boundary into the Netherworld. After fighting off several ghosts, the heroine is confronted by human-ghost gardener Youmu Konpaku. Youmu explains that she had been stealing the essence of \"spring\" throughout Gensokyo in order to make the Saigyou Ayakashi, a youkai cherry tree, bloom perfectly with the rest of Hakugyokurou's gardens, as per her master's orders. The heroine defeats Youmu and hurries to Hakugyokurou to get Gensokyo's spring back. Now at the end of a long journey, the heroine comes face to face with Yuyuko Saigyouji, the ghost princess of Hakugyokurou. Yuyuko reveals that she wanted to revive a certain soul that has been sealed within the Saigyou Ayakashi from before her existence. In order to break the seal, the youkai cherry blossom tree needed to bloom fully and completely. Yuyuko and the heroine wage a fierce battle, to get the last \"spring\" contained in the heroine needed for the Perfect Cherry Blossom, and to reclaim Gensokyo's spring, respectively. After the heroine defeats Yuyuko, the Saigyou Ayakashi starts to lose its health. However the seal has been weakened from the near-complete bloom, and the sealed soul is temporarily unleashed. The soul is actually Yuyuko's. The heroine dodges attack after attack until Yuyuko's soul is finally sealed once more. A few days later, Yuyuko asks the heroine for a favor. The magic boundary between Gensokyo and the Netherworld was weakened by Yukari Yakumo, one of Yuyuko's friends, to make stealing Gensokyo's spring easier. Yuyuko asks the heroine to find her friend, who would be preparing for the flower-viewing event during this time, and remind her to repair the boundary. As the heroine flies closer to her destination, Chen leaps out in front of the heroine, seemingly revitalized and much more powerful. The heroine manages to defeat Chen again, but this only serves to draw out an angry Ran Yakumo. It turns out that Chen was the shikigami of Ran, and Ran is intent on making the heroine pay. Ran reveals that she is also a shikigami, and that she will not let any troublemakers disturb her master. The heroine figures that defeating Ran will get the attention of Yuyuko's friend, and after a fierce battle, Ran is defeated. Surprisingly, Ran's master, Yukari, doesn't appear, and Ran tells the heroine that she should try coming back at night, since her master sleeps less often during the night. After returning that night and defeating a weakened Ran again, Yukari emerges to greet the heroine. Yukari is quite surprised at the heroine's ability and decides to continue where Ran left off. After a vicious fight, Yukari is defeated, and quickly uses her abilities to do the heroine's request.Additional information External links Utsuho Reiuji Main Profile  Utsuho Reiuji or Okuu is one of Satori's pets, a Hell Raven who has lived in the underground world since before it was separated from Hell. Her job is to regulate the flames of the Hell of Blazing Fires.Story  Before the events of Subterranean Animism, she was told by a voice (presumably Kanako's) that she could swallow the god, Yatagarasu, that was hidden in the flames to gain a power that would fulfill the wishes of both the worlds below and above the surface. This power was nuclear fusion. Utsuho misunderstood what the voice had told her, and decided that, using these powers, she would take over Gensokyo. Her friend, Orin, became worried about Utsuho, and drove evil spirits to the surface to cause an incident among the strong youkai above ground, in hope that they would come down to do something about it and, when they got there, defeat Utsuho and bring her back to her former self. What came, however, was not a strong youkai, but a strong human.Backstory  In Undefined Fantastic Object, it is revealed that the geyser she created with her newfound powers wound up blowing Byakuren's Palanquin Ship out from the underground and into the sky, thus starting the plot of that game.Comics  *Return to Touhou Wiki or Random Things This page lists various official and fan-made Touhou comics.

It is unlike most of the previous Touhou games released so far in that it's a VS type game, where two equally matched characters fight head to head. In this regard, the game most resembles the Touhou game Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream for the PC-98, and Twinkle Star Sprites for the Neo Geo/Dreamcast/PS2. This game takes place in the mystical oriental land of Gensokyo. Spring has arrived, but something seems to be wrong. Flowers are blooming and the fairies are becoming active as usual, but the sheer number of flowers and fairies are completely unnatural; even non-spring flowers are blooming. Playing as one of 16 characters, you must battle your way through 9 difficult encounters to reach Muenzuka and uncover the truth behind this abnormal spring.Gameplay  Phantasmagoria of Flower View is considered to be a competitive vertical danmaku shooting game, in which two characters engage in moderate-to-heavy danmaku gameplay within individual and separate play areas (aka. split-screen). Upon meeting certain conditions, players are able to unleash a variety of character-specific Spell Attacks upon their opponents in an attempt to whittle down their remaining health points, in a manner not unlike a VS. puzzle game such as Puyo Puyo. In Story Mode, the player will face 9 increasingly intelligent AI opponents, each more capable than the last. Phantasmagoria of Flower View also features a Match Play Mode in which the player may face off against individual AI opponents or compete against other human players, as well as observe AI vs. AI matches. With the netplay patch, multiplayer is also possible through LAN or over the Internet, although it has proven to be unstable, at best.Story  Spring has come and the flowers are blooming... Only this time far more than normal and even flowers from every season at once. Each heroine (most of them anyways) soon realize something odd is happening when they see the thick covering of flowers all over Gensokyo. The heroines head out in search of answers due to curiosity, duty, or boredom. Nearly all of the heroines start at the lake near Scarlet Devil Mansion. Reimu was alarmed when she noticed the flowers everywhere and quickly went out looking for answers, thinking that not only was it her duty but that if she didn't people might think she was neglectful. Marisa on the other hand noticed the oddness of the out of season flowers, but didn't seem to think too deeply into it at first. Instead she sets out to find who's behind it all simply because she wants to and, more importantly, so she can be the first to find out what's happening. Sakuya also began searching for answers, but again more out of curiosity than from any sense of danger. Youmu looked for answers while admiring the scenery, but without any clue where to start all she could do was wander as well. What she did notice were the ghosts hanging around the flowers, which most of the other heroines paid no attention to. Reisen didn't sense any need to be worried about the flowers, but checked them out anyways. While she was at it she also looked for Tewi who had left without saying anything. Tewi was so excited about the flowers everywhere that she just forgot to say where she was going. Cirno at first appeared to be, basically, an idiot, but at closer look she actually realized not only that there was something strange about the flowers early on but also that a similar event happened 60 years ago before anyone else figured that part out (even characters that had been around 60 years ago). Maybe that has something to do with being a fairy, since all the fairies were becoming more active because of the flowers. She just doesn't seem to care about why it's happening, and instead chose to enjoy herself while she can between bumping into the other heroines. The only thing Lyrica is interested in is finding a good place for a solo performance and to find new sounds to use. Poor Lyrica just keeps bumping into weird people while looking for a place to play until she gets more and more lost. Like Lyrica, Mystia just wants to make music during the whole event, literally singing her way into every encounter. This time even Cirno makes Mystia look a bit \"slow\" in their encounter. Aya knows a big scoop when she sees one. With all the flowers blooming at once she was sure there'd be something newsworthy around, but what was even more interesting were all the ghosts showing up. Everyone was so focused on the flowers that hardly anyone even noticed those ghosts at first. Yuuka, being a Youkai that's been around for a long time, knew exactly what was happening when this incident started. Of course being the youkai of flowers helped too, but unfortunately that also put her straight at the top of everyone's suspect list when they found her enjoying the flowers. Meanwhile Medicine had no interest in finding out what was happening, but rather used this opportunity to defeat whoever she came across with poisonous flowers. It didn't take long before the heroines ran into each other one after another. Each of them demanded answers from the others about what was going on, but few had any real information. Finally we got to Komachi who, as it turned out, is the primary cause for the event. Of course it's not like any of the heroines knew it, they just wandered anywhere they saw flowers blooming until they reached the Higanbana field where Komachi was. It seemed that Komachi was such a slacker that everyone in Gensokyo noticed the flowers except her. The flowers were being possessed by ghosts which were waiting to cross over to Higan and it was Komachi's job to get them there, a job she had neglected. 60 years ago (1945, the end of World War II) there had been another flower incident like this because of the sudden large number of ghosts needing to be ferried across to Higan. It can be assumed Komachi was slacking back then too. After a brief battle with her, Sikieiki (the judge of the dead and Komachi's boss) showed up to give Komachi a scolding for slacking so much. However, before the heroine could leave, Sikieiki saw a perfect opportunity to lecture her on whatever various faults each heroine has, which somehow turned into a danmaku battle to prove the point.Additional information External Links Other Games  Many people have made games inspired by the Touhou world.Seihou Danmaku Beat 'em up Card Fighting Platform Puzzle Racing Rhythm RPG Strategy Flash Visual Novel Unsorted Fan Made Perfect Memento in Strict Sense  Perfect Memento in Strict Sense (\u6771\u65b9\u6c42\u805e\u53f2\u7d00, pronounced Touhou Gumon Shiki, meaning Desired Oral Histories of the East) is the Second Official Touhou Fanbook. Compared to the first, Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red, it is quite serious in tone; focusing mainly on factual information about the world of Gensokyo. Here we see Gensokyo from the perspective of the (almost) normal human Hieda no Akyu, a recorder of its history. Her descriptions show a quite different realm; one where things are described in terms of \u2018threat levels\u2019, and most Youkai are to be feared and avoided rather than laughed at. Nevertheless, it is revealed as a strange and wonderful place. Perfect Memento comes with a CD containing three original music tracks plus some desktop wallpaper, and some shops also added a booklet drawn by Aki Eda and written by ZUN. In addition, one month before release, a manga based upon it called Memorizable Gensokyo, also by Aki Eda and ZUN, was published in the December 2006 issue of Comic REX magazine.Contents Fun Fact  The title \"\u6c42\u805e\u53f2\u7d00\" and Akyuu's ability \"\u6c42\u805e\u6301\" comes from a so-called mantra \"\u865a\u7a7a\u8535\u6c42\u805e\u6301\u6cd5\" (Kokuuzou Gumonji Hou), which is popular in Japan as part of Shingon Buddhism, brought into Japan by Kuukai, one of the most famous Japanese Buddhists. The prayer is for Akasagarbha (\u865a\u7a7a\u8535\u83e9\u85a9, Kokuuzou Bosatsu) to improve their memory retention. This suits Akyuu's ability to remember everything she sees. (a reference page)Suika Ibuki Main Profile  Suika Ibuki is currently the only Oni living on the surface in Gensokyo. The rest of the oni live underground in the Ancient City. Like most oni, she has a ridiculous amount of strength and loves to drink sake. Her personality is jolly and childish, as you'd expect from her appearance. She is strong enough to throw large boulders with one hand. Suika loves to party with all her heart. Along with Yuugi Hoshiguma, she is one of the Four Devas of the Mountain. During Immaterial and Missing Power, Suika wanted to gather humans and youkai to feast everyday. She used her ability to manipulate them by spreading a mist that caused them to feast non-stop. Her intention was to bring out all the oni out of hiding and feast non-stop. In most scenarios, Suika was defeated and the number of feasts dropped rapidly. In her own scenario, Suika defeated everyone she encountered however had to stop feasts anyway due to Reimu's ability. During Scarlet Weather Rhapsody, Suika notices the temperaments being gathered from everyone into the sky, so Suika decides to climb the Youkai Mountain. When she reached Heaven, she spotted Tenshi Hinanawi. Instead of investigating the matter, Suika instead asks for a free space in heaven.Sanae Kochiya Main Profile  Sanae Kochiya is a human, but is also a distant descendant of a god, Suwako Moriya. Her role at the Moriya Shrine is similar to a Shrine Maiden, but with her inherited power Sanae has become more like a deity herself. When humans on the outside world began losing their faith in her and Kanako, the shrine's official deity, Kanako decided to move the shrine to Gensokyo where at least youkai might have faith in them. Sanae is also a friend of Reimu and Marisa. But Reimu sees Sanae also as a rival, because they are both Shrine Maidens. During the events of Mountain of Faith, Sanae tried threatening the Hakurei Shrine in order to establish the Moriya Shrine as the dominant one, not realizing how powerful humans like Reimu and Marisa were. In response to the threats Sanae was defeated by the heroine followed shortly after by Kanako and Suwako's defeat. However, the residents of the Moriya Shrine have since come to an understanding with their new neighbors and live in peace with the other residents of Youkai Mountain. In Undefined Fantastic Object, depending on the scenario, she is ordered either by Kanako to train her own abilities by hunting Youkai or by Suwako to find the Treasure Ship, depending on this, her secondary bullet will become a snake or a frog. In Unthinkable Natural Law, thinking that a gigantic robot appeared in Gensokyo, she is in pursuit of the giant figure, when she stumbles into a giant pit to the nuclear reactor run by Utsuho Reiuji and learns that Suwako is responsible for creating the robot figure, Hisoutensoku. Sanae notices the strange spirit at the Moriya Shrine in Ten Desires and knows what they are, divine spirits, born due to a very strong feeling of human greed, fear, desire and feelings. She takes the opportunity to gather the divine spirits, as it is the same as gathering faith of the human. Though, she can't figure out why those divine spirits are around in the first place.Reisen Udongein Inaba Main Profile  Reisen Udongein Inaba is one of the legendary lunar rabbits; she fled from the Moon to Earth as a refugee from the \"Lunar War\" between the two worlds that began in 1969 A.D. after the Apollo 11 \"invasion\". Making her way to Gensokyo she was surprised to meet the notorious fugitives Kaguya and Eirin, and asked for asylum in Eientei. In exchange, she works for and protects Kaguya and Eirin. During Imperishable Night Reisen hid within Eientei to avoid any lunar emissaries that might arrive on Earth and force her to return to the Moon. She was tasked with sealing the doors inside Eientei to ensure that Kaguya could not be found by the emissaries either. She used her power of insanity to stop the heroines from invading Eientei, but was defeated. Reisen's power of insanity comes from her eyes; she uses them to refract and twist waves, disorienting and confusing her victims and deceiving them with frightening illusions. Perhaps ironically given her insanity-inducing powers, Reisen seems to have one of the more stable and balanced personalities in Gensokyo. In Phantasmagoria of Flower View she worries about Tewi running off and seems more level headed than most other characters. Although she doesn't know what's causing the flower incident, she's decided to investigate by going wherever the flowers are blooming. During the events in Scarlet Weather Rhapsody she appears in the Scarlet Devil Mansion to ask questions but is beaten by the furious Mistress. Later she inquires into the fate of the Hakurei Shrine and asks if the earthquakes are still going on. Failing to find clues, she later goes to Hakugyokurou to check its condition and to ask Yuyuko about the Shrine's destruction. She tells her about the \"completion ceremony\" of the new shrine, but when she goes there, the shrine is destroyed. She also meets Yukari, who forbids her to investigate the shrine. Some time after the battle with Yukari, Tenshi suddenly appears and tells Reisen that earthquakes are just \"fine\". Also, in Silent Sinner in Blue, her previous owners, the Watatsuki sisters, named another Moon rabbit Reisen after her.", "Tales Runner Wiki": "Tales Runner Wiki Tales Runner Wiki Helping out  There is still a lot of work to be done on this wiki.\n If you like Tales Runner, please come help this site grow!External Links Characters    Characters have different base stats which makes them more or less suitable for different race types.

Experience, level, and ladder position don't change regardless on which character is currently selected.Experience  Experience is gained through racing - after each race, all characters gain some amount of experience points dependent on their position at the end of the race and on their equipment and it is added to the account's Exp balance. Exp rewards without modifiers can be found on TR and Exp Racing Rewards page.\n\n There is no way to lose experience in the game, except for GM intervention.Level \u05de\u05de\u05e9 \u05dc\u05d0\u05d0\u05d0\u05d0\u05d0\u05d0\u05d0\u05d0\u05d0\u05d0 \u05ea\u05d9\u05d7\u05d9\u05d5 \u05d1\u05e1\u05e8\u05ea \u05dc\u05d5\u05d8\u05d8\u05d8\u05d83\u05dd'\u05e2\u05d3,\u05d7\u05dc\u05d2\u05dd\u05d3  \u05e1\u05d1  Player level in Tales Runner depends on total experience gained on the account. When the amount of experience needed for a level is reached, the character \"levels up\" and its level icon changes. On leveling up, the player is awarded a certain amount of TR as a prize for reaching next level.Experience and Level Table  Note 1: Level Up Reward items are not 100% confirmed\n Note 2: There are 7 more levels (64~70) for which no information is known yet. Level up reward item to first of them is supposed to be Holy War Case. These need 6,000,000 XP to level up.History Cards  Cards are items used to create Alchemy items. There are two kinds of cards - Map cards, obtained by racing, and Farm cards obtained by harvesting farm plants and animals.Card Properties Manipulation Obtaining  Map cards can be obtained by racing. Each map has a set of cards, one of each star counts, that can be obtained in that map. At the end of each race, every player that participated in the race gets one or two card draws. The chance for getting two draws is affected by Luck stat - the higher Luck the higher chance for two draws. Each draw can give the player one card of the set defined for the map, or no card. Again, chance for getting individual cards is affected by Luck. Map cards can also be obtained by purchasing a bundle of alchemy recipe and cards. Farm cards can be obtained by harvesting Farm plants and animals. On each harvest, player receives random draw of cards produced by the plant or animal. Event cards can be obtained by racing during events, similarly to Map cards, but independent on map selected.Storing  Cards are stored in the account inventory and can be viewed in the Alchemist. Each card stacks up to 99, when amount of given card reaches that number any new card of that kind is not added to the inventory.Usage  Players cannot manipulate cards in their inventory. Cards are removed from the inventory when an Alchemy item requiring these cards for its creation is being made.Card Lists Cards by Numbers  The following sections list all available cards sorted by card number.Alphabetical Lists  Alphabetical list of Map Cards can be found in Category:Map Cards\n Alphabetical list of Farm Cards can be found in Category:Farm CardsLists by Number of Stars  Lists of cards by star count can be found in Category:Cards by Star CountLists by Story  Lists of Map Cards by story they describe can be found in Category:Cards by StoryPets  Pets are parts of character equipment usable with any character. Depending on the pet, the character acquires various bonuses.Pet Leveling  Pets can level up similarly to players, but only have three levels (1 to 3). Level 1 pets can be bought in Shop or obtained via Alchemy (Genie). To level up pets, it is necessary to give them Exp until their exp meter reaches 100%. After it, the pet can be leveled up by purchasing Pet Upgrade Stone and using it on the pet. Pet Exp can be increased several ways:Pet Level table  Exp needed to level pets up is the same for all pets.Pet Life  Pets are obtained with full life which represents 30 days. Pet life is decreasing over time regardless if the pet is equipped or if the account is used. There are several ways to refill pet life: If a pet is not fed and its life reaches zero, it dies and cannot be fed or equipped. To resurrect it, it is necessary to purchase Feather of Phoenix in the Shop and use it on the dead pet.Notes Kai Character Information  Kai was born from darkness; he was later found, adopted, and raised by the genius map maker Dr.Hell. As a baby, Kai was extremely sick. Dr.Hell, after consulting numerous doctors, learned that there would need to be more darkness in the world in order to restore Kai's health. He then stole the Devil Alchemy, an unstable set of alchemy that was to be sealed away with the Angel Alchemy in order to maintain balance in TalesLand, to remedy Kai's sickness. Kai quickly grew and became better. However, not all ended there as Dr.Hell was then kidnapped by a mysterious person, initially only revealed as \"Red Head\", who claimed to be Kai's brother. After this happened, Kai became a Tales Runner in order to save his father and restore peace to Tales Land. Kai is similar to Ocean, except he has 2 points more in the\u00a0Acceleration stat and 2 less points in the Control stat. He will turn into a demon upon entering fury. He was the first character to have this kind of fury transformation. His high Speed and Acceleration makes him a very favorable character. ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)In-Game Dialogue  Using Kai's English voice, originally from Gpotato, carried over to OGPlanet Emotions: Laugh - \"Muahahahaha!\" Angry - \"Bah, I went easy on you!\" Hello - \"Hello!\" Bring it on - \"You will never defeat me.\" Sad - N/A Wow - \"Impressive!\" OMG - \"Oh?\" Yay - \"Excellent!\" Out of Dash: \"Not gonna move\" \"You can't make me move\" \"Go run on your own!\" \"Whatever, it's break time\" \"Give me a break\" \"I'm worn out\" Landing Dash: \"All right!\" Respawn: \"Fear my wrath!\" \"Tell them to get out of my way!\" \"Ready to kill these slow-pokes\" \"Let's do it\" Fury Mode: \"Aaagh!!\" \"Demonic energy...\" \"Meet your maker\" \"Pray for a quick death\" \"You will regret this\"Footnotes  -GPotato made an effort to give him more \"edge\" than he canonically has as a way to make players more excited when he was first being released. -Jin was the first person who told Dr.Hell of the way darkness was needed for Kai to get better -All of Kai's comics have been translated to English, though one has been lost since GPotato's shutdown.Gallery Alchemy  Tales Runner Alchemy system allows players to create new items using recipes and ingredients. Recipes are always bought in Alchemist and are stored in there, too. Ingredients are usually Cards and, in case of higher-level alchemy items, appropriate lower-level alchemy items (can be expired). In some cases, ingredients are items bought in Shop. In most cases, it is also possible to buy a bundle of recipe and all cards needed to create the item.\n\n The Armor of Ladybug Quest serves as an easy introduction to Alchemy for new players.\n\n All alchemy functions are available in Alchemist.\n\n For list of alchemy items, see Category:AlchemyCreating Alchemy Items  Alchemy items are created using a \"slot machine\" which determines how successful the creation was. There are 5 slots on the machine altogether. To stop the wheel, you press the item key(shift). There are a total of 3 different ranks you can get when you stop a slot, \"cool,good and bad\". Based on the result, alchemy items may be C, B,A, and S rank, C being the worst, and S being the best. Based on the rank, the item acquires additional benefits, the higher rank, the better benefits (C rank does not receive any).\n Only equipment pieces receive rank; other items created by alchemy (pets or usable items), although they're created through the slot machine, don't get a class or any additional features. S Rank items can only be created by getting all 5 as \"cool's\". It is also possible to get a bonus stat if you achieve S rank, it is in yellow writing. This is widely called by players as the \"S+\" rank. Other ranks can also get stats higher than usual. e.g. 13% fury gain instead of 10%. This is extremely rare and does not happen very often. A strategy most people use is by spamming the shift button to get \"COOL\" everytime. This method has not yet proven to be 100% accurate.Life time  Alchemy equipment pieces are created with 30 days of lifespan. After 30 days they become unusable but do not disappear from My Room. To extend their lifespan it is possible to repair them using several items: Usable items created by Alchemy do not expire. \n Pets created by Alchemy have the same properties as other pets and must be fed, not repaired, to be usable.Breaking  This section is still under development/Achievements  Achievements are various tasks for players to complete while playing. When an achievement is completed, small information window appears on the top of the screen telling number and name of the achievement completed.

In the OGPlanet release of Tales Runner, Ocean is called Lily.\u00a0 Ocean comes from an island off the coast of Texas that she used to live on with her parents. She is also described as having a \"farm girl\" accent. Ocean is very similar to Ming Ming, except she has 2 points more in the Speed stat. Her 2 point speed upgrade makes her a very favorable character to more skilled players. -- (Dalam rilis lain dari Tales Runner, karakter ini disebut PADA atau Kay. Dalam rilis OGPlanet dari Tales Runner, Ocean disebut Lily. Samudra sangat mirip dengan Ming Ming, kecuali ia memiliki 2 poin lebih stat Kecepatan. Dia memiliki sebuah peternakan gadis aksen. 2 maksudnya Upgrade kecepatan membuatnya karakter yang sangat menguntungkan untuk lebih trampil yang telah berpengalaman)Stats  Character stats affect character behaviour in races or other means of the game.Main Stats  There are four main character stats - Max Speed, Acceleration, Power, and Control. Each of Characters gets a different set of these stats as their base stats and they can be further improved using various equipments.\n Minimum value of each stat is 1, maximum reachable value is 10. Even if the base stat value and equipment combination the character is using would sum up over 10 in some stat, the character efficiently gets stat value 10.Max Speed Acceleration  Acceleration stat affects how fast the character achieves its maximum speed, both when accelerating from standing to running and when accelerating using Dash.Power  Power stat affects how strong the character is. When two characters with different Power collide while at least of them is using Dash, the stronger one kicks the weaker one off its course and gains Dash.Control  Control stat affects how effectively can the character change its running/jumping trajectory.Other Stats  Other stats are common to all characters - each character has the same amount of these stats at the start and it can be improved using various equipment.Luck  Luck stat affects the quality of the cards (ranking from 1 star to 5 stars), the quanity of cards (sometimes 2 cards per race) and the alchemy rank (C, B, A, S).Fury Gain  Fury Gain affects the amount of rage the character gets after collision with an obstacle. Improved Fury Gain leads to getting Fury status sooner.Fury Duration  Fury Duration affects how long a character's Fury state lasts. A normal character's Fury normally lasts about 8 seconds.Stomp Resistance  Stomp Resistance is the chance to block a Stomp attack. Based on equipment used, block may come without effects (just the attack is blocked), the attacked character may get a speed boost similar to using Dash Potion, or the attacking character may get knocked down like if it gets hit by Fury.\n Stomp Resistance works even in races with Stomp OFF option.\n It is possible to gain 100% Stomp Resistance e.g. by combining a Chickadee pet (level 2 or higher) with a good helmet.Electricity Resistance  When a character touches an electricity beam, it gets electrocuted for a while. Electricity resistance reduces the time for which the character is electrocuted. Wings can reduce the time when the character gets electrocuted.Item Resistance  Item resistance has the power to reduce effects or duration of certain Capsule Items being used on the character. Examples: reduction of Pumpkin Ghost or Bucket Mask duration or increased chance of being transformed to a lizard when hit by Transformer.Maki Character Information  In the OGPlanet release of Tales Runner, Maki is known as Mika. Maki possessed the ability to see ghosts ever since she was young. In fact, one of them caught her when she was little and never let go. The stress of constantly seeing ghosts, combined with alienation from her peers due to them, was too much for her to handle. She became a Tales Runner to win the Wish Stone and finally be free from her \u2018gift\u2019.\n\nMaki has the lowest base Power in the game which is compensated by the highest base Control. She is very similar to Lina\u00a0in character stats. Maki's ghost can also be switched to other purchasable ones in the Shop under the Special category; this feature is unique to Maki. These ghosts can provide different stat boosts, unlike her default ghost, upon equipping them. -- (Dalam rilis OGPlanet dari Tales Runner, Maki dikenal sebagai Mika. Maki memiliki daya dasar terendah dalam permainan yang dikompensasi oleh basis kontrol tertinggi. Dia sangat mirip dengan Lina dalam karakter statistik dan perbedaan dapat biasanya dikompensasi dengan menggunakan peralatan yang sesuai. Hantu Maki juga dapat beralih ke yang dibeli di toko dalam game, ini adalah fitur unik untuk Maki. Hantu ini bisa menambah meningkatkan stat yang berbeda untuk Maki, tidak seperti hantu standar nya setelah membeli nya.)Rough Character Information  In the OGPlanet release of Tales Runner, Rough is known as Troy. Rough, an exceptionally talented motorcyclist, was involved in a bad accident when he swerved to avoid a cat in the road. His body recovered fast, but, as a result of nerve damage, he could only do everything backwards. This meant no more motorcycles for him, and that meant he had to join the Tales Runner race and win the Wish Stone to fix himself up\n\nRough is very similar to Big Bo, as in comparison all off his stats are shifted by at least 1 towards more balanced values. -- (Dalam rilis OGPlanet dari Tales Runner, kasar dikenal sebagai Troy. Kasar sangat mirip dengan Big Bo, dibandingkan dengan semua statistik nya dialihkan oleh 1 terhadap nilai rata-rata. Karena ini dan lebih baik secara keseluruhan terlihat itu dipandang sebagai lebih baik dari Big Bo.The differance utama adalah bahwa dengan kasar Anda mendapatkan penampilan, dan dengan Big Bo Anda mendapatkan harga yang lebih rendah.)Gallery Emblems  Emblem is a symbol that can be displayed over character's head. It does not take any character equipment slots and does not improve any character abilities. Various emblems and trophies can be acquired through completing quests with varying difficulty. Acquired emblems can be then equipped either in My Room or in Emblem Menu, trophies can be used on Farm. In order to complete an emblem quest, it is necessary to first start the quest through Emblem Menu and after that to perform required task. With exception to tasks that can be completed only once (missions), completing the task without having the quest active has no effect. It is possible to have up to five emblem quests active at a time. If needed, it is also possible to inactivate active quest without effect on the progress (i.e. already completed tasks stay completed). Emblem Menu is accessible from Waiting Room or from User Info window. modol modol modol modol zaHistory  Emblem system was introduced to US TR in January 21, 2010Lina Character Information  In other versions of Tales Runner, this character is called Nessa or Tiffany. Lina has the highest base Acceleration in the game which is compensated by its lowest base Max Speed. Stats-wise it is very similar to Maki, generally all differences can be compensated by using appropriate equipment. In the Korean release of Tales Runner Lina's character model was renewed as part of the February 15, 2017 update. ... (Lina memiliki basis Percepatan tertinggi dalam permainan yang dikompensasi oleh basis terendah Max Speed. Statistik-bijaksana itu sangat mirip dengan Maki, umumnya semua perbedaan dapat dikompensasikan dengan menggunakan peralatan yang sesuai.)Big Gallery Game Controls  Tales Runner characters are controlled using keyboard.Basic Key Usage Moving  Pressing Direction keys makes character accelerate in the direction corresponding to the direction key, relatively to the camera view. For instance, pressing the Up key makes the character to accelerate away from the camera. Pressing multiple direction keys (usually one of up/down and one of left/right) makes character accelerate diagonally. The acceleration continues while keys are pressed. After reaching maximum speed the character stops accelerating and continues moving at that speed.\n Releasing all direction keys or pressing a direction key in the opposite direction of the direction the character is currently moving at makes the character come to a halt.Shaking  When the character gets electrocuted (e.g. in maps with Daddy Octopus boss monster), pressing Left and Right direction key shortens the recovery time.Jumping  Pressing the Jump button makes character to jump. To make another jump, the Jump button must be released and pressed again. Jumping is not possible while swimming.Double Jump  Pressing the Jump button once more while the character is in the air from previous jump makes the character double jump - the character will jump again from its present position in the air. Double jumping is not possible while skiing.Falling  In free fall, tapping the Jump key makes the character to fall faster.Climbing  While climbing, tapping the Jump key makes the character to climb faster.Dashing  Pressing the Dash key makes the character accelerate with greater power and at the same time increases its maximum speed from maximum running speed to maximum dashing speed. Upon releasing the Dash button the character will quickly deaccelerate back down to its maximum running speed. Dashing uses the Dash storage. When the storage is depleted, character becomes exhausted, stops and takes a while to recover.Landing Dash  Pressing the Dash key shortly before character touches the ground from free fall makes the character to start from that point at maximum dashing speed and keep that speed for a short while. It also adds small amount of Dash to the Dash Gauge if it's not full.Landing  Pressing the Dash button in free fall will make the character to straighten and prepare for landing. Upon reaching the ground the character will not crash and recovery time is shorter compared to crashing. Using this prevents Landing Dash.Using Item  In Item races, pressing the Item key activates the item the character is currently holding.Passing Baton  In Relay races, pressing the Item key determines the quality of accepting the baton from previous racer or passing the baton to the next racer. There are three different qualities that can occur depending on when the item key is pressed. These qualities are bad, cool, and good. A bad quality pass will result in the characters tripping to the ground and requiring them to spend a short amount of time recovering. A cool pass will result in the character recieving the baton starting at maximum dashing speed. A good pass will result in only a successful passing of the baton in which neither character trips to the ground.Fury  When the character is ready to use Fury (i.e. it has filled up its Rage and Dash meters), pressing the Item and Dash keys at the same time will activate Fury.Dash Jumping  Dash Jumping is an advanced running technique allowing the character to keep maximum speed while minimizing the usage of Dash. It uses the fact about Game Mechanics, that the character does not lose speed when the Dash key is released if it either entered second jump phase of Double Jump, or is on descending part of single Jump.\n There are two basic variants of Dash Jumping. They are both variants of the same technique and it is possible to combine them.High Dash Jumping  This method provides very low usage of Dash but jumps are relatively short. Atsutane's Dash Jumping Tutorial on YouTube provides detailed demonstration of this technique.Low Dash Jumping  Compared with High Dash Jump, this method uses much more Dash but also provides twice as long jumps which reduces the Dash/distance ratioApollo Character Information  In other releases of Tales Runner, this character is called Narcissus.\n\nApollo has the highest base Max Speed of all characters in the game but he also has the worst Acceleration and recovery time. He's the least suitable for beginners but the Max Speed and higher sum of base stats (14) somewhat compensates for it. In the Korean release of Tales Runner Apollo's character model was renewed as part of the February 15, 2017 update. ... (Dalam rilis lain dari Tales Runner, karakter ini disebut Narcissus. Apollo memiliki basis tertinggi Max Kecepatan semua karakter dalam permainan tetapi ia juga memiliki terburuk Percepatan dan waktu pemulihan. Dia yang paling cocok untuk pemula tetapi Kecepatan Max dan jumlah yang lebih tinggi dari statistik dasar (14) agak mengkompensasi untuk itu.)Gallery Piero  Piero is a character used exclusively by members of US Tales Runner GM Team when entering the game to contact players or organize events. From playing as a Piero, you realize it's stats, motions, voices, and stats are the same (Excluding Max Stat Police Piero). Also these properties don't change even if the account does not have a Charlie character on it. Usage of Piero character is triggered by the game Account being flagged as GM account and this overrides that account's character settings (i.e. any other characters, such as starting character, existing on that account). Piero cannot use any equipment, but can be grantified the use of Elf Shoes Piero is available in seven color variants (red, orange, yellow, blue, dark blue, green, and purple) and additional forms equal to the Cupid Piero NPC, Farm Piero NPC and probably also Wedding Piero NPC. Other forms such as Ski Piero, Police Piero, and many other Piero types are hidden within TR's database. GM's can warp players, warp to players, start events, mark someone as a bad user, make notices, ban, and foricbily take leader and take over rooms. (Source - Playing as a piero in private servers)DnD Character Information  DnD, in the OGPlanet Release, is known as Cassandra.\n\nDnD is very similar to Charlie, the only difference is sacrificing one point of Acceleration for Max Speed. Lower Acceleration makes it less suitable for beginners than Charlie or Ming Ming but higher Max Speed and overall looks of the character are considered attractive by some players. Later into the game her lower sum of stat points (12) and overall stats distribution may become limiting. In the Korean release of Tales Runner DnD's character model was renewed as part of the February 15, 2017 update.Gallery Charlie Character Information  In other releases of Tales Runner, this character is called Charlie, Kwong Kwong, or Jaka. In the OGPlanet release of Tales Runner, this character is called Billy. Charlie has no wish to fulfill using the wish stone and had become a tales runner simply because he enjoys running.\n\nCharlie has balanced stats with no significant weaknesses which makes it suitable for new players and for general racing. Later into the game its lower sum of stat points (12) and lack of strong stats may become limiting. In the Korean release of Tales Runner Charlie's character model was renewed as part of the February 15, 2017 update.Park  The Park\u00a0is one of community maps. Player characters can meet there, chat, run around, or use various NPCs to access more park functions.

If you are new to wikis, check out Help:Contents.Statistics Dante  Dante is the series\u00a0protagonist of the Devil May Cry\u00a0franchise\u00a0and the main playable character for the majority of the games in the series. He is the second son of the demon Sparda and the human Eva, and the younger twin brother of Vergil. Dante is a paranormal mercenary, private investigator and vigilante Devil Hunter dedicated to exterminating evil demons and other malevolent supernatural forces; a mission he follows in pursuit of those that killed his mother and corrupted his brother.Appearance  As stated in an interview with original series creator Hideki Kamiya in the Devil May Cry Graphic Edition artbook, the earliest ideas he had for Dante's design were centered around three key points; \"[a] long, stylish coat\" to make the character \"showy\", \"[a] British man\" as Kamiya wanted him to be a \"witty, yet traditional fighting man\", and \"doesn't smoke cigarette[s]\", believing that the character was too cool to smoke. In the same interview, another noted influence on Dante both design wise and character wise was Cobra of the acclaimed Japanese manga and anime series Space Adventure Cobra. Kamiya believed Cobra's cocky attitude and red attire were key points for a \"heroic\" character. Ironically, despite Cobra being a heavy cigar smoker, Dante himself does not smoke, as Kamiya believed Dante to be cooler without a cigarette. Ever since Devil May Cry started development as Resident Evil 4, Dante has had white hair. It's remained in a consistent style throughout the series, although there are a few differences between installments. In Devil May Cry and Devil May Cry 4 his hair is somewhat parted with his bangs brushed down; in Devil May Cry 3 his hair is brushed down with his bangs partially covering his eyes, and in Devil May Cry 2 his hair is much thicker, with his bangs parted in front of his right eye. Dante has worn a myriad of clothing throughout his many appearances, yet his most glaring trait is his affinity for red-colored apparel, often in the form of long, two-tailed coats. In Devil May Cry 3, Dante wears long, tan colored jeans, black fingerless gloves, and military-style boots. His coat has zippers on the sleeves and a buckle around the waist, and two brown, leather holsters on the back to carry Ebony & Ivory. Contrary to later games, Dante does not wear any form of clothing underneath his coat, going shirtless throughout the whole game, displaying his silver half of the Perfect Amulet around his neck, as well as his bare, well-toned chest and muscular physique. Following Dante's first battle with Vergil, his half of the amulet is stolen and the right sleeve of his coat is damaged, with Dante tearing it off afterward. In his final confrontation with Vergil, his left glove is slashed across the palm by Yamato, and the epilogue shows that Dante keeps it on his desk, perhaps in remembrance of his lost brother. In the original Devil May Cry and the anime adaptation, Dante wears red pants with two black belts wrapped around his right thigh, a black, leather belt, black gloves, and high, black boots. Dante's coat is much simpler in design, with an upturned collar and short sleeves with black cuffs, though the coat lacks coattails. Underneath the coat, Dante wears what appears to be a black long-sleeved shirt, with a red vest with black clasps over it. In numerous cutscenes, his half of the Perfect Amulet is once again on display, yet it appears infrequently and is not a permanent feature on his character model. In his appearance in Devil May Cry 4, Dante's outfit arguably takes on it's most flamboyant look. Dante once more wears red pants, yet they are almost completely covered sans his crotch and rear by long, black leather motorcycle chaps featuring a brown, cowboy boot design around the ankles. He wears black, loafer looking boots, and black gloves exposing his knuckles and index finger on each hand, and his pants are wrapped with a black belt featuring a silver emblem decorated with a demonic skull. The coat is given a much more detailed and stylish look, with Western and Italian features, and a deep red, almost crimson color. Once more the coat is short sleeved, with numerous gold colored studs decorating the shoulders, collar, and chest, and a single zipper on the front, yet Dante is never seen zipping it up in-game. Underneath the coat, Dante wears a black, zipped up undershirt with three clasps closed together with ornate, golden buckles, and medium length sleeves that can be seen passing his shoulders. This undershirt is also zipped up just below his neck and features an upturned collar which complements the one on his coat. Another noticeable design choice separate from Dante's outfit is his chin, covered with short, black stubble, reflecting his older age, as series director for 2 through 4 Hideaki Itsuno states that Dante is \"almost 40\" by the events of Devil May Cry 4. In Devil May Cry 2, Dante's outfit is identical to the one seen in the first game, but with more pronounced, poignant features. He wears high black boots and red jeans once more, yet has a single belt wrapped around each thigh. A belt featuring a skull themed buckle wraps around his waist, and he wears black, gauntlet shaped gloves with three buckled straps on each one. His coat is a deeper red than in the previous game, with two coattails, yet the coat has a more pronounced buckled collar, and a black strap going over his right shoulder wrapping around his chest, with two golden studs on the front. The front of the coat is also patterned individually from the rest of it, resembling a sort of vest or body armor, with a zipper closed all the way up from the waist to the bottom of Dante's neck, perhaps reflecting his introverted nature seen in the game. In Devil May Cry 5, Dante's outfit takes on its most simple look. His red jacket is faded and has a washed-out look. He wears an ordinary black T-shirt, black driving gloves,\u00a0jeans, and boots. This gives Dante a more grungy look. By the events of Devil May Cry 5, Dante has visibly aged, now with flowing white hair and stubble. His introversion from Devil May Cry 2 seems to have been downplayed for unknown reasons, and like his last incarnation, is fully suited.Personality  As seen at the beginning of the series, Dante is incredibly flippant, casually mouthing off to even the most powerful of demons, and he generally enjoys showing off and taunting his adversaries as often as he can. Dante also displays a fearless, almost disinterested attitude towards incredibly dangerous situations, such as assuming Trish simply had to use the bathroom after crashing through his office's front door on a motorcycle, being attacked by the Seven Hells in his office, being swallowed by Echidna, and effortlessly shrugging off wounds such as a headshot or impalement numerous times, the latter of which happens quite frequently for the Devil Hunter. While maturing as time goes by, Dante never loses his care-free, devil-may-care attitude, except in\u00a0Devil May Cry 2. He can be serious when the situation calls for it, but still maintains an overall laid-back demeanor during tense situations, and is never without a witty taunt or comeback. Although seemingly shown at times to be uncaring or callous, Dante maintains a very strong sense of justice like his father, and prefers to fight fairly, never fighting humans or opponents weaker than him. He can be counted on to do the right thing, even if he makes humorously cynical quips about it the entire time. Unusually, while he has displayed discomfort with his own demonic side, only coming to accept it following the events of Devil May Cry 3, Dante has little qualms about accepting demons that choose the side of good and admires their desire to be human, such as Trish and Bradley. Though Dante is quoted as believing that \"Humans are often worse than demons.\" in the anime, he refuses to kill full-blooded humans for any reason, believing it would make him no better than any Devil, be it human or demon. In addition, Dante values family and friends very highly. He cared deeply for his mother and, despite their differences and conflicting ideals, for his brother, Vergil. Even after their intense duels and conflicts in Devil May Cry 3, Dante still tries to prevent Vergil from willingly falling off the edge of the Human World into the Demon World, and goes so far as to cry over losing him. While he says little about his father, Sparda, over the course of the series, Dante has been shown to clearly maintain a level of respect for, but for a time bitterly resented him due to his absence and inability to prevent Eva's death. While bitterly claiming that \"[he doesn't] have a father\" in his first fight with Vergil in 3, he eventually comes to accept that he is a son of Sparda and grows to respect him as the game goes on, proudly claiming in his final duel with his brother that not only do they carry Sparda's blood, but his soul as well. He also makes a humorous comment towards Arkham, smugly claiming that his father wasn't as hideous as his twisted form, citing his own physical appearance as proof. Dante also enjoys fighting, shown when he restrains himself from using his full potential but he is also quick to use full power if his opponent proves to be sufficiently powerful. In Devil May Cry 4, he was clearly going easy on Nero in their first confrontation despite having seen his nephew in action, as he overpowered him in their second clash with only mediocre effort. In the anime, Dante gets bored with fighting weak opponents and only finds entertainment in fighting strong opponents who will give him a challenge. Dante's enjoyment of fighting was further emphasized in his pre-battle banter with Echidna, asking her if she agreed with him that \"a fight every now and then makes life more interesting\". Despite Dante's handsome appearance, he often has terrible luck with women, a condition he ironically reflects upon in Devil May Cry 3 when Lady shoots him through the head after he attempts to keep her from falling. In the animated series, Dante was shown to be one of the few characters in the Devil May Cry series to swear. Dante was frequently shown to be foul-mouthed, repeatedly swearing in almost every episode. Despite verbally complaining about being in debt, Dante seems quite willing to perform missions solely for the good of them, and rarely, if ever, enforces payment from poor clients. In fact, Dante will typically refuse any job he dislikes, regardless of how much it pays, but will immediately take on any paranormal cases, especially those involving demon hunting, with or without pay. Many of his clients take advantage of his hospitable nature, and leave bills for property damage caused during the mission instead of paying for his services. Interestingly, despite his claims of having low funds, Dante still manages to pool up enough money to buy pricey luxuries for his office, such as a pool table, a jukebox, and several expensive pieces of musical equipment such as electric guitars. He often borrows from Lady, attempting to gamble to repay his debts to her and others. However, he has extremely bad luck with all forms of gambling, even something as simple as a coin toss, and loses any game not involved with demon hunting. As a result, he is deep in debt to Lady, and is often left with no money at all after she takes her cut. However, in Devil May Cry 4, Lady actually pays him a small, single role of bills for his \"assistance\", implying that he no longer owes her money. Dante has a fondness for pizza, usually with \"everything\" on it, and while he complains about olives, he always ends up with them on his pizza. In the animated series, he is also shown to favor strawberry sundaes as well, with it being pointed out on several occasions that those two foods are seemingly all he eats. He also has a fondness for alcohol, specifically whiskey.Strategy Devil May Cry 4  While Nero's first encounter with Dante serves as a tutorial, the second fight is much harder, as he will begin using all four of his styles, as well as his Devil Trigger. It should be noted that, on higher difficulty modes, the battle in Mission 1 becomes just as difficult as the Mission 10 encounter.Music Appearances in Other Media Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne  As part of a deal with the company Atlus, Dante, in his Devil May Cry 2 incarnation, makes a special guest appearance in the updated Maniax version of Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne, released as Shin Megami Tensei: Noctune and Shin Megami Tensei: Lucifer's Call in US and European territories, respectively. In the story of the game, an event which recreates the world called the Conception occurs, killing almost every human in Tokyo save the few who may hold the key to recreating it. Dante is mentioned by an NPC before the Conception occurs as a \"strange foreigner wearing a red cloak and carrying a big sword\" walking around Tokyo, and later survives the Conception, being hired by a mysterious old man to kill the protagonist, the Demi-fiend. He is faced as a boss twice throughout the game, once in a mandatory fight, and again in an optional encounter in the Third Kalpa of the Labyrinth of Amala. He can later be recruited to the party in the entrance of the Fifth Kalpa, where he uses the same coin seen in Devil May Cry 2 to decide the fee for his services. His attacks are all based around his sword Rebellion and pistols Ebony & Ivory, using skills such as Roundtrip and Stinger.Viewtiful Joe  Dante is a playable character in the PS2 version of the game, where he must save Trish. He later appears in the PSP version of Viewtiful Joe: Red Hot Rumble as a bonus character, where he lends his biplane, Karnival, to Captain Blue for a scene in one of his movies, and he and the player race to defeat the boss of the stage.Marvel vs. Capcom series Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds  Dante is a playable character in Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds and Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 in his Devil May Cry 3 outfit. He is first seen in a trailer facing off against Deadpool, his rival in the game. In his ending, he prepares to square off against Ghost Rider. Interestingly, his physical features seem to be based off of his Devil May Cry 4 incarnation, but his outfit and repertoire is directly lifted from Devil May Cry 3. In the updated re-release, Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3, Dante receives a new ending where he is approached by Mephisto, who attempts to tempt Dante into signing a contract with him with the promise of reviving his mother and improving relations with Vergil. Dante responds by threatening to kill him unless Mephisto can provide him a job that will pay excessively, so Mephisto requests Dante to take out his son, Blackheart. He also appears in Ghost Rider's ending where he, Ghost Rider, and Trish threaten Mephisto's life, forcing him to undo a contract.Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite  Dante will return in Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite, retaining his Devil May Cry 3 looks. In this game, he obtain new moves like his a walking Horizontal Gun Shot during the shot, while an Air Shotgun acting as an Air Combo Finisher. In the story mode after 88 days of Convergence caused by Ultron Sigma (a fusion between Ultron from Marvel's Ant-Man/Avengers and Sigma from Capcom's Mega Man X via Infinity Stones (mainly Space and Reality, while the rest are scattered across the merge universe)), he is amongst the heroes besides Thor, X, Chun-Li, Rocket and Hawkeye on the raid against Ultron Sigma in \"their\" base on a merged Highway and Asgard called Xgardian. He is first seen with Hawkeye and Rocket, and shares his Ebony & Ivory with Rocket for the latter's backup ammo. After Doctor Strange found out Thanos had been imprisoned by Ultron Sigma, the heroes plans a rescue mission, sending Chris Redfield, Chun-Li, Rocket, Strange and Strider Hiryu, in case if they are not powerful enough to defeat Ultron Sigma, which proves to be true. As Thanos has been rescued, the heroes fall back to Avengers Tower safely to create a new plan on splitting up each teams collecting Infinity Stones from Thanos' help, with Iron Man, Hawkeye and Spencer are last seen watching Thanos, in case if Thanos planned to betray the heroes behind their back. Dante gains a more hotheaded attitude in this game, and somehow gains more control over his Devil Trigger, being able to speak within it. For the first time since Jedah's ending in Capcom Fighting Evolution, where Dante showed up behind him, he clashes with the Dark Messiah. He seems to have awakened more demonic traits in him, such as his nearly demonic laughter, when Jedah first counterattacks him and can be more capable of high-risk gambles, such as handing the soul stone to Ultron Sigma, despite this act appearing as outright betrayal to the heroes.Other Trivia Gallery  For a collection of all images relating to Dante, please see\u00a0Gallery:Dante.Vergil  Vergil was the eldest of twin sons born of the demon Sparda and human Eva, and is the main antagonist of Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening and a playable character in its special edition. Following the death of their mother as children, Vergil and Dante go their separate ways, with Vergil rejecting his humanity and embracing his demonic heritage, contrasting his younger brother's embrace of humanity and initial rejection of the demonic. Stoic and reserved, Vergil displays a willingness to do anything in his quest to obtain the power of his father, Sparda. In an unknown conclusion to a confrontation with Mundus in the secret ending to Devil May Cry 3, he is corrupted and becomes the Dark Angel encountered in Devil May Cry known as Nelo Angelo (also alternatively spelled Nero Angelo). After numerous conflicts throughout the game, he is finally defeated by Dante. He later makes a playable appearance in Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition, where he is featured in his own personal campaign detailing his actions in the city of Fortuna decades before the events of 4, and shortly before 3.Appearance  In terms of physical appearance, Vergil has fair, yet pale skin, and white, swept back hair, which puts emphasis on the fierce, yet stoic expression on his face; however, when his hair is brushed down or becomes wet, his appearance is physically indistinguishable from his younger twin brother, Dante. Just like his brother, he also possess the same, blue-colored eyes. In terms of apparel, Vergil commonly wears a long, silver buttoned blue coat with three separated coattails. A white, serpentine pattern runs around the collar, with a snakes head hanging over the coat's left shoulder, and its tail slinking down the right, all the way to the bottom of the coat. A gold lining runs across the edges of the coat, and a silky, golden flower blossom pattern decorates the inner lining. Each cuff of the coat also possesses five, gold buttoned straps with gold lining; in Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition, the coat also features identical straps on each shoulder, decorated with silver buttons instead of gold. Underneath the coat, Vergil wears a navy blue ascot wrapped around his neck, which hangs over a black, sleeveless vest that reveals his well-toned arms and shoulders. He wears tan, finger-less gloves, a brown, snakeskin belt with a silver buckle, dark green pants with a scale pattern running across its surface, and tall, brown boots with two golden buckled straps at the top. During certain in-game cutscenes in Devil May Cry 3, Vergil's golden half of the Perfect Amulet can be seen around his neck, yet it is not a permanent part of his character model. As Corrupt Vergil, Vergil's appearance becomes much more sinister; his skin takes on a sickly, almost grey pallor with blue, pulsating veins running across his face. His eyes become a deep red, with black pupils. In addition, he now wears his father's clothing instead of his own, with his half of the Perfect Amulet replacing Dante's half as its brooch. In Devil May Cry 4, his outfit is slightly modified to his coat split into three coattails similar to his old outfit. As Nelo Angelo, he wears a heavy, olive green/jade green colored armor with blue, pulsating lines running across it, and a purple, bat like cape. The armor features a helmet which fully encloses his head; a still, humanoid face with glowing, orange eyes detailing the front of the helmet, red and blue horns protrude from the sides, and he takes on skull-like knee guards, with one horn bigger than the other, but is designed evenly. Also instead of carrying weapon's he usually has, Nelo Angelo carries just a massive, unnamed broadsword which is serrated and erupts a fiery blue aura when attacking. His size is much taller than Dante's, showing off his intimidating stature. In his final confrontation with Dante, Nelo Angelo removes his helmet to reveal his true face: the face of Vergil, now sporting a completely white skin tone, with blue veins and red, pupil-less eyes.Personality  In contrast to his twin brother Dante's boisterous, outgoing, and extroverted personality, Vergil is calm, cool, collected, and introverted, constantly maintaining an aura of fearlessness. Vergil cares little for the well-being of those around him, and is unflinching in his pursuit of power; however, in spite of his cold and ruthlessness demeanor, he is an honorable warrior, who maintains his own set of morals and disciplines, he despises fighting dirty and cheap tactics, and refuses using firearms, deeming them unworthy of a \"true warrior\", staying true to only his blade as well other melee weapons he managed to obtain from defeated enemies. His code of honor still surfaces while he is corrupted as Nelo Angelo: he refuses to attack Dante from behind and waits until both are outside to begin their first fight. It would appear that Dante and Vergil were close at one time during their childhood. Despite all that happened between them, their rivalry and mutual dislike for one another, it would seem that Vergil does truly care for Dante. During their fight against Arkham in Devil May Cry 3, Dante and Vergil worked effectively as a team and were comfortable with pulling off complicated maneuvers like swapping swords in mid-air. Upon finishing him off, Vergil and Dante used Dante's guns for it while simultaneously saying a catchphrase, \"Jackpot\", after Dante asked\u00a0his brother, \"Remember what we used to say?\" This bond between them is not entirely gone. It is believed that during their last battle, Vergil refused to be saved by Dante so as not to acquire his father's power for himself, but to actually save Dante and allow him to take a final decision whether to be trapped in the Demon World or not. Unlike Dante, Vergil is willing to embrace his demonic heritage, and seeks to emulate his father's power and cold persona. While Dante seeks to protect humanity from the demons, Vergil wants more demonic power, regardless of the consequences for those around him. Despite his normal personality of cold dismissal, he does cherish two things - the Devil-blade Yamato, a dark O-Katana left to him as a keepsake by his father, and his own half of the Perfect Amulet, a keepsake from his mother. In Devil May Cry 3, Vergil seems to reveal some of his feelings by claiming to Dante: \"Might controls everything, and without strength you cannot protect anything, let alone yourself.\". This may be a reference to their mother's death. It may also imply that Vergil seeks power as compensation for failing to protect her. His failure may also have made him forsake close human relationships. As Nelo Angelo, Vergil only depends on fighting battles to finish the work. While also becoming fully demonic, he will only make dark chuckles instead of commenting on his foes' own efforts to beat him. As addition to his boosted demonic abilities, his mind is slim and any form of memories (which also includes the half of the Perfect Amulet that Dante had) will cause his mental state to be stimulated with scarred ones.Devil May Cry 1 novel  As Gilver, Vergil was very sadistic as seen when he violently tortures Dante using Nell's shotgun. Vergil began to dislike alcohol after having lost a drinking match against Tony, passing out, and being robbed by the bar's patrons.Gameplay Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition  In Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition, players may play on a separate file as Vergil. Vergil's scenario has a new prologue, but all other cutscenes were removed. Also, while the Vergil boss fights are still fought, the boss wears red instead of blue so that the player can see the difference. Vergil possesses his Devil Trigger and all three of his Devil Arms (Yamato, Beowulf, and Force Edge) from the beginning of his scenario. His signature Dark Slayer Style behaves somewhat like an upgraded Trickster Style, allowing to quickly move on the battlefield and ambush enemies. It must also be leveled in order to allow purchase of higher level actions for Vergil's weapons. Vergil also cannot obtain as many actions per weapon as Dante can, and uses his Summoned Swords instead of firearms. Vergil's Yamato is a faster weapon than Dante's Rebellion, but has weaker power and range. Yamato can be compared to Agni & Rudra in its role, although it has completely different moveset. Vergil's Beowulf cannot charge attacks like Dante's, but overall is more powerful. Vergil can also use Yamato and Force Edge together, and his actions with the pair of swords resembles Dante with the Rebellion. Finally, while firing his Summoned Swords cannot propel Vergil like Ebony & Ivory can propel Dante, they can still juggle enemies, can be used without interrupting other actions, and can be used both to guard himself or to surround the enemy. Instead of Dante's \"Legendary Dark Knight Dante\" and \"Super Legendary Dark Knight Dante\" costumes which allow him to assume Sparda Devil Trigger, Vergil possesses the \"Corrupt Vergil\" and \"Super Corrupt Vergil\" costumes which allow him to assume his Nelo Angelo Devil Trigger. While in human form in either incarnation, his appearance is similar to Dante's \"Legendary Dark Knight Dante\" look, except without the monocle, and has evil red eyes, a pale complexion, a darker purple coat with yellow borders, and highly noticeable dark veins in his face. As Nelo Angelo, Vergil becomes noticeably stronger than Dante in their first encounter and his entire moveset changes to that of that one he possessed in the first game. His armor and zweih\u00e4nder serve as his weapons and both inflict dark elemental damage. He attacks with slow but strong sword slashes, punches and kicks that generate an azure-colored flame. He can also charge up to fire explosive azure blasts of energy with either weapon. Nelo Angelo still retains his Air Trick, but comes in the form of vanishing in a blaze of azure flame instead of a blur. While the powerful armor gives him higher resistance to flinching, he is noticeably slower than his original devil form.Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition  In the Special Edition of Devil May Cry 4, Vergil will retain his moves from the Special Edition of Devil May Cry 3, but also added with elements from the reboot of the franchise DmC: Devil May Cry in the form of just frame Judgment Cuts and using Summoned Swords to warp towards his targets as well as other interactables. It is known that his moves are also fully upgradable. And a feature has been added for his choice of stylized fighting, which is known as the \"Concentration\" mechanic. While in action, Vergil's abilities and moves will grow stronger and faster the more calmly and flawlessly he fights. Unlike with the other four playable characters, Vergil goes through all of the stages by himself. The Concentration mechanic is signaled by a blue gauge in the upper left corner of the screen which is Vergil's Concentration Gauge. It has three levels. The higher the level, the more powerful attacks he will be able to perform. To increase the gauge, Vergil can land attacks on enemies and dodge their attacks, standing still or walking towards them, but if he is hit by an enemy or if he runs away from one, these cause the gauge to deplete. Missing attacks also depletes the gauge, so the player must be efficient with their attacks during battle.Appearances in Other Media Viewtiful Joe  Vergil's attire is a costume for Stylish Alastor in Viewtiful Joe Red Hot Rumble.SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters DS  Vergil is a character card in SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighter DS.Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3  In Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds, Vergil is the fourth alternate color costume for the famous Capcom and Resident Evil villain, Albert Wesker. Vergil appears as a playable character in the updated version of the game, Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, having been leaked before his vignette was shown at the Tokyo Game Show 2011. As before, he still wields all of his weapons from Devil May Cry 3 which include the Yamato, Beowulf and Force Edge, while still using their attacks in the same manner. While not as combo savvy as Dante, his Yamato gives him excellent range in his normals and his Trick maneuvers can either be used independently or used right after several specials, giving him excellent mindgames. Unlike most characters, Vergil has four Hypers, one being the desperation version of his Judgment Cut called \"Dimension Slash\" from the final battle, another where he brings about his Spiral Swords to augment his attacks and use them in the same manner he did in Devil May Cry 3, using the familiar arrow formation and the boss-only orbiting formation, both which use up the gauge. Another of his activates his Devil Trigger and his fourth, a Level 3 Hyper called \"Dark Angel\" only available in DT where he slashes the opponent, summoning swords behind his opponent with each strike and then rains them down on his opponent when finished. This Hyper is one of the most damaging Hypers in UMVC3. Vergil's theme is a remix of his boss battle theme from Mission 13. His alternate colors consist of a black swap based on a concept render, a blue and red one based on Nero, a white based on Kyosuke from the Capcom fighting game, Rival Schools, a red one for his \"Vante\" version and a vibrant blue and red one based on Dimitri from Darkstalkers, another Capcom fighting game. His DLC outfit is Corrupt Vergil (although the appearance of his Devil Trigger Hyper is that of Sparda as opposed to Nelo Angelo, the developer citing problems integrating the appearance of Nelo's weapons with Vergil's moveset). In the CG opening, he is seen fighting against Wolverine. In his arcade mode ending, he subdues Wolverine by stealing the Muramasa Blade from him to negate his healing factor. Unfortunately, Vergil becomes addicted to the Muramasa's blood-thirsty nature fueling his Devil Trigger (implying it to be the first Muramasa Blade), and seeks out more blood for the sword to feast on.Basara  A DLC costume based on Vergil's likeness is available for Ishida Mitsunari in Sengoku Basara 4, complementing Date Masamune's DLC costume based on Dante. Both costumes serve to compare Mitsunari and Masamune's rivalry to the one seen between Vergil and Dante.Playstation All-Stars Battle Royale  Vergil appears as an obtainable icon in Playstation All-Stars Battle Royale, unlocked after players reach Rank 18 with Dante.Project X Zone 2  Vergil makes his debut in the sequel to Project X Zone, where he appears as a pair unit with Dante, and is capable of pulling off the super move \"Jackpot!\" with him, referencing the finishing blow to Arkham he performed with Dante using Ebony and Ivory in Devil May Cry 3. His corrupted alter ego, Nelo Angelo, also appears as a Rival Unit; the two existing as separate entities as Vergil is time-displaced from the past prior Devil May Cry 3 whilst Nelo Angelo exists as his present timeline incarnation.Trivia Nero  Nero is one of the main protagonists of Devil May Cry series. He first appeared as a playable character in Devil May Cry 4, and later in Devil May Cry 5. He is the son of Vergil\u00a0who is raised in Fortuna and serves as a Holy Knight in the Order of the Sword, a religious group that worships Sparda and fights to protect the world from demons. In Devil May Cry 4, however, he is forced to fight against the Order after encountering Dante and uncovering a conspiracy to conquer the world using The Savior. In its aftermath, he establishes a Fortuna branch of Devil May Cry. In the upcoming Devil May Cry 5, Nero is a more seasoned demon hunter that has since changed his operation to being a mobile Devil May Cry branch and finds himself fending off a\u00a0demonic invasion as he chases a mysterious figure that severed the\u00a0Devil Bringer from his arm.Development  The Devil May Cry 4 Material Collection Artbook shows a myriad of sketches and changes over Nero's design. Several concepts of him include Nero in white clothes similar to those worn by the rest of the Order, some which are very aristocratic in appearance, and some that are similar to Vergil, decked in blue. In most of them, Nero has a much slimmer build, and his eyes are a different color, where they are predominantly yellow, in contrast to the color seen in the final version of the game. The artbook also has several images depicting Nero with a full Devil Trigger that has wings, but this design was scrapped in exchange for the spectre-like form seen in the final game. According to Devil May Cry 4: Deadly Fortune novel, Nero was originally named after a sculptor called Rodan, who created Gates of Hell, a monumental sculptural group depicting scenes from Dante Alighieri's Inferno in high relief. However, because the crew preferred a two-syllable name, and because they were afraid \"Rodan\" might give too much of an \"intellectual\" impression, they decided to go for a different name. As stated in the novel, Morihashi Bingo accidentally came up with the name Nero, and it has nothing to do with Nelo Angelo. In early publicity art, screenshots, and trailers for Devil May Cry 4, Nero's Devil Bringer originally had a golden glow before it was changed to blue; the reason for this change is unknown, however, it is speculated that it was changed to hint and represent that Nero was the son of Vergil by sharing the blue colour. Nero has some sort of relation to Sparda, due to the connection he has with the Yamato, and his alleged place in the Sparda bloodline. While in the past the exact details of this have yet to be established by Capcom in game, the Devil May Cry 4 novel contains hints that Nero is Vergil's son, and this claim has allegedly been confirmed at \"Captivate 2009\" by one of the Capcom employees who worked on the game's localization. However, it was later confirmed and plainly stated that \"Nero is in fact Vergil's son\" by the Graphic Arts 3142 art book.Appearance  Back in his initial appearance, Nero wears a long\u00a0black\u00a0and red coat with The Order of the Sword's insignia sewn into both shoulders. He also wears a red zip-up hoodie/vest underneath this coat, a black muscle-shirt beneath that, and a pair of black pants. In addition, he wears two rings on his left hand: one on his index finger that has the emblem of The Order of the Sword on its face and another on his ring finger which bears a rose design, identical to the designs on his belt buckle, coat clasp, and coat buttons. He has white hair brushed down and blue eyes, similar to Dante and Vergil. In Devil May Cry 5, Nero shortens his\u00a0hair, similar to the alternate Dante and\u00a0now wears a less gothic and a more casual attire,\u00a0consisting of a dark blue hooded jacket,\u00a0a dark crimson shirt and\u00a0black pants with military-style combat boots.\u00a0He also has a cybernetic arm in place of his Devil Bringer.Personality  In contrast with Dante's laid-back and occasionally flirtatious, cool and stylish attitude, Nero is a more serious, cynical, distant, sardonic and somewhat antisocial person. He is a choleric character, is prone to mood swings, and has been seen to both cry and become very angry multiple times during the events of Devil May Cry 4. He is also very rebellious, much like or maybe more than Dante and Sparda before him: he wields a gun, despite the Order's general prohibition against them; he doesn't really believe in the Order's religion; and cares little for the legend of Sparda. Despite this, he is also very loyal to his friends, especially to Kyrie and Credo. Even though he doesn't care for the Order of the Sword's religion, Nero still participates in some of their activities out of respect for Credo and Kyrie. However, his rebellious nature leads to the Order having him work alone on \"special jobs.\" In fact, Nero actually prefers to act as a lone wolf. Like Dante, Nero is a somewhat arrogant and cocky person. He shares Dante's habit of casually mouthing off to even the most powerful of his enemies, making taunts and sarcastic jokes on the battlefield. Nero also taunts in a similar, sarcastic fashion to Dante: One taunt involves him bowing mockingly and asking, \"Shall we dance?\"; another has him aiming the Blue Rose at his enemies and saying \"Bang!\" instead of shooting; and another has him applaud his enemies. When he first received the Devil Bringer, he considered it a curse and covered it with a medical sling to hide it out of shame. However, over time he began to train with the Devil Bringer but doesn't fully accept its existence until the end of Devil May Cry 4. Nero is one of the few characters in the Devil May Cry series to actually swear and showcased offensive and crude behavior to others. Such instances includes: him calling\u00a0Agnus a \"jackass\" and his laboratory a \"hellhole\". He also almost calls Agnus a \"son of a bitch\" later, but is cut short. Before fighting Dante, he tells him \"Kid? Well, if that's how you see me, I think you'll blush a pretty pink when I kick your ass\". Later on, he tells Sanctus \"Go blow yourself\" and could say \"I'm not interested in your bullshit!\" when using a Buster in the first battle with the vicar. Lastly, he gives Dante the middle finger\u00a0before being absorbed by The Savior. In Devil May Cry 5, his personality is still the same. However, now that he has Kyrie at his side, he warns her not to get hurt when he goes into\u00a0battle as he tells her to stay inside the house. He also holds a grudge against the person that took his Devil Bringer arm away from him. He still works alone but uses the gadgets that Nico makes for him.Biography Video Games Before Devil May Cry 4  Mentioned in an incident report, a number of demons appeared suddenly from the Mitis Forest and attacked Fortuna. Nero was present at the scene and exterminated all of the demons, but he couldn't prevent demons from injuring Kyrie and his own shoulder. Nero's sword, the Red Queen, was also damaged and sent for repair. Kyrie recovered completely, but Nero's shoulder never healed properly, and was transformed into something else. Initially he believed it to be an infection\u00a0but, upon realizing it was demonic power, he began training with it in secret.Devil May Cry 4  On the day of the Festival of the Blade, Nero barely manages to make it to Kyrie's performance in time after dealing with a group of demons, with a man in red secretly watching him from the rooftops. He leaves her a gift and then prepares to leave, having grown tired of Sanctus's preaching. Just before he can, though, the mysterious man in red bursts in through the glass ceiling during a prayer and slays Sanctus, the leader of the Order. Before the assassin (who is later revealed to be Dante) can confirm the kill, Credo, along with a battalion of knights confront him, but are completely outmatched. Kyrie, seeing that Dante is going to kill her brother, finally escapes Nero's hold on her and runs to them, but is knocked down in the process. When Nero sees the man in red looming over Kyrie, he kicks him in the face and orders Credo and Kyrie to go get help while he stalls Dante. The two fight, and Nero is forced to reveal his Devil Bringer. With it, he was able to knock Dante back and impale him with his own sword on Sparda's statue. But Dante, who isn't just a mere mortal, frees himself and jumps down. Nero states that Dante isn't human, to which Dante then pulls Rebellion out and comments that they're the same, and points out the knights he had slain, who turned out to be demons. Confused, Nero watches as Dante flees the scene. Shortly after, Kyrie returns Nero's sword, Red Queen, at Credo's request. Credo gives an order to Nero - to pursue the man in red, with witnesses seeing him heading to Fortuna Castle. Suddenly, all three feel the building shudder, and leave to discover the city's citizens being attacked by demons. While Kyrie and Credo lead the survivors back to headquarters, Nero fights off the remaining demons. In order to pursue Dante, Nero goes through Fortuna, which is totally overrun with demons. His pursuit of Dante leads him to discover the source of these demons:\u00a0in a small village at the base of Lamina Peak, just outside the city, Nero finds the first Hell Gate and fights its guardian, Berial the Conqueror of the Fire Hell. After defeating Berial, Nero makes his way through a supernatural blizzard to Fortuna Castle\u00a0where he meets Gloria, a new member of the Order whom he's never seen before. After some exposition, Nero and Gloria go their separate ways. When Nero enters Fortuna Castle, he finds it infested with demons and starts to investigate. He finds the second Hell Gate and fights Bael, a large toad-like demon whose specialty is ice. While exploring the castle, Nero stumbles upon a secret underground laboratory of the Order,\u00a0where he meets Agnus, the Order's Chief Alchemist. Agnus reveals that he created the Hell Gates and uses them to summon demons, which he needs for his experiments. Agnus also reveals that by using this power, Sanctus hopes to rule the world by using the Savior, the god-like being the Order constructed. Agnus has Nero nearly killed by his Angelos, but Nero dramatically unleashes his Devil Trigger with the help of his Devil Bringer arm while gaining a phantom-like appearance in the process. In this form, Nero manages to repair Yamato, the broken sword of Dante's fallen brother, Vergil,\u00a0which Agnus had been holding within a containment field inside his lab. Nero then forces Agnus to reveal his Angelo form and retreat. Afterwards, Nero heads towards The Order's headquarters, believing Credo knows more about what is going on. He crosses a bridge which leads into a cave concealed by the Foris Falls and finds himself in the Mitis Forest. Here, Dante bumps into him, but their encounter is very brief. Dante apologizes snidely to Nero, stating that \"it'll have to wait\", and then jumps off a cliff. Nero fights countless demons on his way through the forest and eventually banishes Echidna the She-Viper, a dragon-like demon who treats the demons of the forest as her children. After that, Nero reaches the Headquarters without any other surprises. At the entrance he is met by Credo, whereupon Nero asks who Dante is. Credo draws his blade and exclaims that Nero does not have the authority to demand answers from him. Nero reflexively uses his Devil Bringer to block an attack from Credo, exposing his secret. Realizing that Agnus, who brought news of Nero's demonic power to the Orders' commanders only moments earlier, was right, Credo transforms into his Angelo form and declares that Nero is under arrest. A fight ensues, after which Credo returns to his human form and Nero emerges victorious, but Kyrie, appearing seemingly from nowhere, screams out when she beholds what she interprets as Nero, with a demon arm, trying to kill Credo. Nero tries to explain and calm Kyrie, but Agnus swoops in and captures her, revealing Sanctus's desire to use her to get to Nero. Credo is furious as Agnus flies away with Kyrie, so he asks Nero to put aside this fight and vows to get\u00a0the truth from Sanctus. While Credo flies off to see Sanctus, Nero pursues Agnus and Kyrie. Nero finds and fights Agnus in the Order's headquarters and succeeds in defeating him. Just as Nero is about to finish off Agnus, an army of Bianco Angelos, led by none other than Sanctus himself, in the armor of an Alto Angelo no less, swoops in to aid him. As Sanctus leaves with Kyrie, Nero jumps after her, but he is only able to grab her necklace, which he gave to her as a gift back at the cathedral. Nero turns around and continues to pursue Agnus, Sanctus, and Kyrie.\u00a0However, he runs into Dante on his way out. Nero tries to ignore Dante, but Dante reveals that he wants Yamato back because it used to belong to his brother, Vergil. Nero refuses, causing another fight between them. Although Nero is wielding Yamato and manages to disarm Dante, he soon is forced to acknowledge Dante's superiority when he swiftly knocks him down with only his bare hands. However, Dante also says that now he is calm and cool so he can go now, revealing Dante was not only fighting him but was also guiding him at the same time. Although Dante did want\u00a0his brother's sword back, he allows Nero to keep it for now, seeing how he needs it and that he is calm headed. Dante asks Nero's name and so he reveals it to Dante while\u00a0also commenting that each other's names were \"not bad,\" thus showing their mutual respect. Nero later finds Sanctus next to a giant statue resembling Sparda, which is the Savior. Sanctus asks Nero if he wishes to surrender himself and form the Savior's core together with Kyrie in which Nero refuses and attempts to rescue her, but fails and falls into Sanctus's trap. In the process, Sanctus takes the Yamato from Nero. Suddenly, Credo appears, enraged because Sanctus had used Kyrie, and attacks his former superior. Sanctus runs him through with Yamato, causing a mortal wound, and Credo to fall off the Savior but is caught by Dante. He, together with Trish, witness as Nero is absorbed into the heart of the Savior. The Savior soon awakens and flies toward Fortuna. Credo asks Dante to honor one last request:\u00a0to save both Kyrie and Nero, after which he dies. Much later, Dante, having retrieved Yamato and destroyed all the Hell Gates, faces off against the Savior. After weakening the Savior's exterior, Dante thrusts Yamato into the core of the statue, awakening Nero and allowing him to escape the heart-like organ imprisoning him. After completing a number of trials within the Savior, Nero finally confronts Sanctus. Sanctus, having achieved even greater levels of power with the Sparda, asks why Nero betrayed the Order. Nero answers that Sanctus has done enough foul deeds to make Nero hate him. During their exchanges, Sanctus also scoffs at Nero for being held back by love. Nero finally defeats Sanctus inside the Savior. In a final bid for victory, Sanctus implores Sparda for power, but his request remains unfulfilled. In a fit of rage, he asks why Sparda refuses to give him the power to kill Nero. The sword remains silent, but Nero explains to Sanctus that although Sparda was a demon, he did have a heart, one that could love another person. Lacking this, the sword will not grant his request for power. Nero saves Kyrie and kills Sanctus, and they escape the Savior. Although it seems that all is finally over, the Savior suddenly transforms into the form of the False Savior, taking on Sanctus' appearance. Nero asks to fight in Dante's stead, and Dante acquiesces. Nero offers a quick prayer to God, during which he explains how he's come to terms with his demonic power, and destroys the False Savior and Sanctus once and for all by using it. Nero meets up with Dante, with whom he exchanges thanks and friendship. With Dante about to leave, Nero tries to return Yamato back to him, but he refuses to take it saying it's now entrusted to Nero. In their final moments together, Nero asks Dante if they'll meet again, but Dante just vaguely waves in answer. Kyrie joins Nero as they both agree it's all over, and, although the city is in shambles, they express no regret.\u00a0Instead they admit their desire to be together. Despite Nero's demon power, Kyrie shows total acceptance of him. Nero returns the necklace to her and they nearly kiss, but they are interrupted by some remaining Scarecrows. Nero fights them off while Kyrie waits and also\u00a0agrees to kiss him later in the final scene. After defeating the demon, Nero and Kyrie are seen holding hands while looking on at a distance.Before Devil May Cry 5  Some time after the events of Devil May Cry 4 and before Devil May Cry 2, Nero was given a blue Devil May Cry neon sign by Dante. With it, Nero soon set up his own mobile Devil May Cry branch and officially became a professional demon hunter.Devil May Cry 5  Nero appears as a playable character in Devil May Cry 5. \u200bNero, along with new allies, fights off a widespread demon invasion of a major city. He also searches for a mysterious cloaked figure who is seemingly look like Vergil took the Devil Bringer. After losing his Devil Bringer, his arm is replaced by a cybernetic one to assist him in combat that is called the Devil Breaker.Powers & Abilities Powers  Due to his demonic heritage, Nero possess great potential of power and amazing combat prowess. Though he is stated by Sanctus to not be in Dante's caliber during the period in which he opposed the Order of the Sword, Nero has proven himself to easily surpass members of the Order of the Sword and several, formidable demons such as Berial and Echidna. He has even defeated Dante when Dante was holding back, with Dante openly acknowledging that Nero was more powerful than most of the many opponents he had faced, although he was beaten when Dante used full power. Demonic hybrid physiology: Nero possess both the blood of a demon and human due to his heritage from Vergil. As such, he is granted a far more powerful physiology. Demon power manipulation: Nero has shown the ability to channel his demonic energy into his gun from his Devil Bringer or in the air to perform Charged Shots and Air Hike.Abilites  Combat proficiency: Nero's combat abilities are great enough that the Order sometimes assigns him missions to carry out on his own and he has earned certain respect among his peers. Engineering: Nero upgraded his Red Queen to bypass the limiter placed on the reviving feature as well as to spray a flammable accelerant on the blade. He also built designed and built Blue Rose himself.Devil Trigger  After the events in the underground laboratory, Nero acquires Yamato and the ability to use Devil Trigger with it. His Devil Trigger is quite unusual in that it doesn't transform Nero himself: instead, a blue, spectral demon avatar manifests behind him, wielding the Yamato. This demon has a noticeable resemblance to Vergil's Devil Trigger, mainly because of the \"sheath\" on its left arm, used for storing Yamato when it is not in use. Nero himself only acquires a blue aura, burning red eyes, and a deeper, echoing voice. The specter usually mimics Nero's movements, doing right-handed versions of Nero's attacks. After acquiring Devil Trigger Nero gains the ability to fire Summoned Swords, similar to Vergil. He also gains accelerated healing; for example when he was repeatedly impaled in Mission 6 and later healed from the fatal injuries leaving no signs of injury left.Arsenal Music Appearances in Other Media Deadly Fortune  Nero, hinted to be the son of Vergil, was born and shortly thereafter left on the doorstep of an orphanage, while getting the name Nero from the black blanket he was found wrapped in. He would later meet Kyrie and Credo along with their family and together, the three of them grew up in the city of Fortuna. Throughout his childhood, he would be teased by many of the children in Fortuna, who accused him of being a bastard child of a prostitute due to the fact that no one knew who his mother was. He would also grow close to Kyrie and Credo's parents. Throughout his life, he would be taught in swordsmanship by Credo and grew closer to his sister, Kyrie. However, both their parents would soon be killed by demons. Unknown to Nero, they were humans who failed in maintaining their sanity in the Ascension Ceremony. This event would lead him to not believe in God. Eventually, Nero would go on to join the Order of the Sword in spite of his conflicting beliefs due to the fact he idolized Credo and his sense of justice and also\u00a0for the sake of playing a part in protecting Fortuna, a city that Kyrie held dear. However, he would gain the dislike of the members of the Order of the Sword due to his lone wolf nature, apparently terrible skills in teamwork, and utilizing guns within the other,\u00a0which is in contrast to the Order's belief that battles should be fought with only\u00a0a sword much like how\u00a0Sparda did when he was alive. However, Nero cared little for their beliefs. One day, he had rescued Kyrie, who was attacked by demons while walking with orphans in Mitis Forest. During the rescue, his arm was injured. Later on, it would change into what would be known as the Devil Bringer. Nero surmises the reason for this was that he reached a point in life where his arm would be what it is supposed to be due to his apparent demonic nature, much like how that of a caterpillar turns into a butterfly.During DMC4  While the\u00a0events of Devil May Cry 4 took place, there are\u00a0some differences within the novel from the game: As he was being stabbed by Agnus and was dying, he thought of a dream he had been having recently. He met a man he had never met before, in which he described as having a \"cold\" glare but with a touch of \"gentleness\" (or kindness). The man asked \"Can you hear it? The cry of a soul\" and also asked him what his soul was \"saying\". However, Nero pushes the question back and asks him the same question, in which he replies with a smile \"Power...I want more power.\" Hearing that, he replied \"I'll take that too\" and awakens his Devil Trigger, which is the representation of his soul, then reconnected Yamato.Devil May Cry 4 Refrain  In the iPhone version of the game, Nero becomes a boss character for Dante.Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds  Nero is mentioned in Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds. After Dante is defeated by Deadpool, Deadpool says \"Next time, maybe you should let Nero do your fightin', skippy.\"Playstation All-Stars Battle Royale  Nero appears as an unlockable icon in Playstation All-Stars Battle Royale. To unlock players must reach Rank 24 and 25 with Dante.Trivia Weapons in the Devil May Cry series  The various weapons in the Devil May Cry series are generally either Devil Arms or firearms.Devil Arms Sparda Yamato Rebellion Alastor Ifrit Cerberus Agni & Rudra Nevan Beowulf Gilgamesh Lucifer Balrog Cavaliere Guns Ebony & Ivory Summoned Swords Luce & Ombra Throwing Daggers Kalina Ann Kalina Ann 2 Handguns Blue Rose Shotgun Grenadegun Needlegun Nightmare-\u03b2 Nightmare-\u03b3 Missile Launcher Submachine Guns Darts Cranky Bomb Bow Gun Artemis Spiral Coyote-A Pandora Faust Hat Other Swords Cutlaseer Devil Bringer Merciless Vendetta Klyamoor Zambak Red Queen Devil Breakers Overture Gerbera Punch Line Buster Arm Ragtime Tomboy Helter Skelter Rawhide Mega Buster Sweet Surrender Pasta Breaker Gerbera GP-01 Monkey Business Sparda  Sparda (\u30b9\u30d1\u30fc\u30c0, Sup\u0101da) was a mighty demon swordsman who is known as the \"Legendary Dark Knight\" (\u4f1d\u8aac\u306e\u9b54\u5263\u58eb, Densetsu no Makenshi, lit. \"Legendary Demon Swordsman\"). Two thousand years prior to modern times, he \"woke up to justice\" and defeated Mundus and his legions alone. When sealing the netherworld, sensing his power had grown too strong, he intentionally sealed himself and his own demonic power in as well. Later, he escaped his prison under unrevealed circumstances and quietly reigned the human world, continuing to preserve harmony. Before his death, he resurfaced in the modern day and married Eva, who gave birth to his twin sons, Dante and Vergil.Appearance  In his human form, Sparda was a tall, handsome man with blue eyes, a youthful face, and slicked-back white hair. He is shown to have worn a purple Victorian outfit with a white cravat, a large red jewel around his neck, and a monocle over his left eye. While riding into battle on horseback, he would wear armor reminiscent of his demon form. In his true form, Sparda was a slightly-larger-than-human-sized, vaguely insectoid demon with clawed hands, a scaly hide, a pair of downward facing ram horns, chiropteran wings with beetle-like wings underneath, hooves for feet, and reptilian spines protruding from his back. Parts of his body appeared to be made of grey scales with accents of red and purple. He also had gold veins on his hands and arms, chest, shoulders and back, a red diamond eye shaped gem in the center of his forehead, and skull-shaped gold knees and elbow guards with small horns. His most notable feature in his natural form were his slit-like eyes, which glowed red and did not have pupils. He is often shown wreathed in fire, although it is uncertain if he was simply impervious to it or if he summoned it.Personality  Although not much is known about him on a personal level, it is said that he was both rebellious like Dante and level-headed like Vergil. Legends speak fondly of his courage, righteousness and his thankless missions to protect the human world at the expense of being labelled as a traitor by all of his kin. Sparda's wife, Eva, always described him as being a noble fighter with courage and a righteous heart. Sparda understood honor and possessed great wisdom. Sparda had two apprentices, Baul and Modeus, though he only entrusted his true strength and power to the kind-hearted Modeus as opposed to his colder brother Baul. Not long before his rebellion, he swore an oath with his students to live true to their aspirations.Gameplay  In Devil May Cry and Devil May Cry 3, Dante can obtain the \"Legendary Dark Knight\" costume by clearing Hard mode. Dante begins with it unlocked in Devil May Cry 4 Special Edition. In Devil May Cry, this seems to actually be Sparda himself, as Dante's Ebony & Ivory are replaced with Sparda's Luce & Ombra. The sword Yamato is added to his arsenal, but players can still use Alastor. Yamato is basically a clone of Alastor, but when Sparda Devil Triggers, Yamato turns into the sword Sparda. Dante's DT and shadow are that of Sparda's devil form, no matter the equipped Devil Arm, though his abilities still depend on that Devil Arm.Biography Early History  Prior to his rebellion, Sparda was the most powerful demon swordsman. During this time, he was the mentor of the twin brothers Baul and Modeus, and he entrusted his teachings to Modeus. At some point, he saw the tyranny and injustice of the\u00a0Dark Emperor and rebelled, fighting to save humanity. Before his rebellion, he made a pact with his students to live true to their aspirations and to carry them out. He alone defeated the hellish host, before moving on to the Emperor of Darkness himself. Sparda defeated Mundus, sealing him into a marble vault, and what was left of Mundus's armies retreated back into the demon world. In order to close the gateway, Sparda used his own blood, along with the blood of a human priestess, in conjunction with his sword and a mystical amulet. He poured his demonic energy into his beloved sword to close the door between realms, the Temen-ni-gru, though this also robbed him of the lion's share of his abilities. As an added measure, he also imprisoned within the tower its gatekeepers - Cerberus, Agni & Rudra, Nevan, Beowulf and Leviathan - and took the names of the Seven Sins in order to imprison them and set them as seals keeping the Temen-ni-gru underground.Fortuna and the Protectorate  Later, he sealed another path to hell in Fortuna using the Yamato. Sparda's activities over the next two thousand years are shrouded in legend, though it is understood that for a time after defeating Mundus, he benevolently ruled over the humans before eventually vanishing. The demon Berial implies that he encountered Sparda when he came to the human world two millenniums prior. At some point, Sparda once fought alongside the Protectorate and Matier, later crossing into the demon world and returned. During the time in Hell, Sparda fought against both Argosax and Bolverk.Later Life and Death  Sparda later appeared in the twentieth century where he met and fell in love with a woman named Eva, who bore him twin sons. He would later disappear and eventually died at some point under unrevealed circumstances.Powers and Abilities  The exact extent of Sparda's powers remains unknown; but it is shown that his powers surpassed even the godlike Prince of Darkness himself, evidenced when Sparda single-handedly defeated Mundus and his demonic armies. He had also defeated the Demon God Argosax, who had managed to subdue every demon in the Underworld. His powers are often held in high regard by human and demon alike, even those who view him unfavorably. His tremendous prowess is due to the fact that he embraced humanity. Due to his power, many seek to utilize his weapons such as the Sword of Sparda to gain power equivalent to his own. The immensity of his power is shown where his very blood that courses through his spawn, bestow the latter with great physical prowess and magical abilities. As Mundus is shown to be able to surpass Dante's earlier might, it is certain that Sparda too could overpower Dante at the time but they seemed to have grown evenly matched, if not, Dante being a bit superior, after Dante had managed to kill Argosax. He was also implied to be a master swordsman, as he trained Baul and Modeus into powerful swordsmen and Modeus stated that Sparda was \"the best swordsman in the Demon World\", although Dante went so far as to mock his father's sword work when he faced Baul. He was also a very adept in sealing, having sealed away extremely powerful demons such as the likes of Mundus & Argosax. Among his skills includes crafting and creating various magical items such as the Perfect Amulets, Rebellion, and Yamato.Weapons  Sparda is known to have used both Yamato and the Force Edge. The former he used as a key to lock the Demon World away from the Human World, and he sealed the power of the latter with the Perfect Amulet, turning it into the Force Edge. Also, in Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening, it is stated that Rebellion is a memento from Sparda to Dante, though its exact significance is unknown. He also used the Luce & Ombra, his own hand made pistols.Media Appearance Marvel vs. Capcom 3  Sparda is available as a downloadable costume for Dante, and his own Devil Form replaces Dante's while in Devil Trigger. He also makes a second appearance in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 as the Devil Trigger form for Vergil's downloadable outfit, instead of Nelo Angelo as seen in the Special Edition of Devil May Cry 3.Playstation All-Stars Battle Royale  Sparda appears as an unlockable icon in Playstation All-Stars Battle Royale. To unlock players must reach Rank 14 with Dante. Upon reaching rank 22 players are also granted a Sparda themed wallpaper.Trivia Trish  Trish is a demon created by Mundus\u00a0who strangely resembles Dante's mother, Eva. After his defeat by the hands of Dante, she later joined Devil May Cry and became a devil hunter alongside him. During her stint within the Order of the Sword, she went under the alias \"Gloria\". She is a major character in the series, although she originally started as one of Dante's enemies. Trish appears as a playable character in Devil May Cry 2 and Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition, she is also present in Devil May Cry and Devil May Cry 4 as well.Appearance  Trish is a demoness that looks identical to Eva. She has long, blond hair, blue eyes, and a very fair complexion. Her clothing usually consists of black leather pants, high-heeled boots, a corset, double belts, a choker, and some kind of wrist accessory. In Devil May Cry, her hair is parted slightly to the right, and her corset is black with a lighting bolt design that leaves much of her chest bare. She has black leather pants with a double belt and black knee-high boots. She accessorizes this outfit with a choker, a fabricated gauntlet on her left forearm, and a pair of sunglasses. For a majority of Devil May Cry: The Animated Series, she wears her Devil May Cry attire, however in Rolling Thunder, she first appeared wearing a brown leather jacket. She would later change into a white tank top with various laces on it. Her black pants had yellow lightning bolts on both of the back pockets and were held up by a brown belt with a large silver bucket. This white outfit is accessorized by a black choker, a gold bangle on her left wrist, and a black arm band with a large metal plate on her right bicep. In Devil May Cry 4, Trish's hair is mostly swept back with some bangs on the side. Trish wears a black corset with white filigree and a lightning bolt design on the front. The zipper on the front is also designed like a lightning bolt. Her black leather pants have lightning bolts on her rear and white filigree-like designs on the hips. Trish's pants are held up by a double-ended belts. Once again she has a pair of knee-high high-heeled boots. Her accessories consists of a black choker and a black leather gauntlet with three belts on it. Her nails are painted black. As Gloria, Trish has a tan and a white, chin length bob. Her outfit is a lacy, white one piece with orange accents that exposes her chest and inner thighs. The chest area is held closed by a thick, orange chord zig-zagging across both sides. The one piece has a loin cloth and a long tail. She has white thigh-high, high-heeled boots. Trish accessorizes this outfit with white, elbow-high gloves that fold at the top exposing an orange lining. It also has blue feathered shoulder pads. Trish's Devil Trigger encompasses her in a smoky yellow aura and she dons her sunglasses.Personality  As a puppet of Mundus, Trish was originally cruel and uncaring, but after Dante saved her, she began to develop emotions and compassion towards him, and eventually sacrificed herself to save him from Mundus's attack. After being revived, Trish joined Dante at his shop, and showed excitement at being his partner. By the time of the animated series,\u00a0she has gone off on her own. She returns occasionally and seems to enjoy playfully picking on Dante and giving him trouble, and although she rejoins him in Devil May Cry 4, she has basically the same habits and bickers with Dante at several points in the game. She is also shown to be more feminine in her appearance than other women in the series, having been shown re-applying lipstick before leaving for a mission and has painted her nails. She also seems to enjoy mocking peoples' beliefs as one of her taunts the Order of the Swords belief in a savior. Another taunt has her condescendingly asking if she looks like a demon. Like Dante, she enjoys a good fight, prolonging a fight with Lady for up to two days rather than telling her who she is. In the epilogue of Devil May Cry, she challenges Dante to complete their mission in five minutes and Devil May Cry 4, refers to her up coming mission as a \"party.\"Gameplay Devil May Cry 2  Trish appears as a secret character which can be unlocked by beating Hard mode with Dante or Lucia. She can be used in both Dante's and Lucia's missions, and she wields Sparda, Luce & Ombra, and Nightmare-\u03b3 as her weapons. She also retains her ability to shoot lightning.Biography Devil May Cry  Trish comes to Devil May Cry one night to meet Dante. There she attempts to electrocute him, but with his demon powers he easily overpowers her. Trish is defeated, but tells Dante that she needs his help. She takes him to Mallet Island, where Mundus is planning to open the gate to the Underworld to cross over to the Human World. It is eventually revealed that Trish was actually created by Mundus as a lure to kill Dante in the island. After betraying Dante during a fight with Nightmare and trying to kill him, Dante still saves her life from falling rocks. Trish is deeply moved by this, although she still returns to her master. Later, the demon king then tries to kill Dante by using a very powerful beam from his third eye. However, Trish returns Dante's favor and sacrifices herself instead, pushing Dante out of the beam's path and allowing herself to be struck instead. Before following Mundus into the Underworld, and believing Trish to be dead, Dante utters the famous line, \"I should have been the one to fill your dark soul with light!\" He then leaves her with the Sparda and the Perfect Amulet. Later, cornered by a heavily mutated Mundus, Dante hears his mother's voice, and Trish bursts through the wall to aid him. She lends him her power and Mundus is defeated. With Mundus destroyed, Dante and Trish embrace, and she begins to cry. Dante tells Trish that she has become human, because \"Devils never cry\". It is implied that she works with Dante at the newly-renamed Devil Never Cry.Devil May Cry: The Animated Series  Trish is a freelance devil hunter, having left Devil May Cry to do her own work for a while. She comes to visit Dante from time to time, leading her first appearance in the show to a fight with Lady when Lady accepts a job to kill a lightning demon. As it turns out, Lady's client was a demon himself and wanted to get rid of Trish because she was hunting him. Trish and Lady end up getting along and place Dante into further debt by buying expensive clothing and leaving a reluctant Dante with the bill. Later in the show, Trish does some investigative work from time to time to help Dante in his jobs. During the final fight with Abigail, she and Lady fight against hordes of lesser demons as Dante faces Abigail. Dante extends to her an open invitation to return to Devil May Cry whenever she wants near the end of Episode 4, which she declines at first, and apparently accepted after the series. At the end of the series, she departed with Dante and Lady to a job outside the city, in which she remarked \"the winner gets the reward.\"Devil May Cry 4  By this time, Trish is seemingly living with Dante and working alongside him as a Devil Hunter. When Lady informs them about the actions of the Order of the Sword, Trish takes the Sparda to Sanctus while posing as \"Gloria\", and is made an Executive of the Holy Knights, in order to to gain intel on the Order. She uses this placement to spy on the Holy Knights, but because of her looks and rapid promotion, she enjoyed a somewhat negative reception by the other members of the Order. She discards her disguise once Dante and Nero reach the Order's headquarters, and after the Savior is activated, she goes to evacuate the island's townspeople while Dante attacks the giant statue. After Sanctus and the Savior are defeated, Trish and Lady rejoin Dante while Nero and Kyrie kiss. Back at Devil May Cry, Lady brings a briefcase with Dante and Trish's pay for the job. Tish opens the case to find a small money roll, and questions Lady about how little pay they received. Lady remarks that the situation on Fortuna escalated so much because she brought them Sparda. She then directs her attention to Dante looking for his opinion. After making it known that he is satisfied to get any money, the phone rings and Trish answers the call. After getting the password from the caller, Dante, Trish, and Lady set out to solve the case together.Powers and Abilities Powers  Supernatural strength: Trish possesses incredible raw bodily strength. Without strain she can lift and throw a motorcycle and a large wooden crucifix, as well as catch Scarecrow attacks with her legs. Supernatural speed: Trish is shown to be fast enough to fight hand to hand with Dante. Supernatural agility: Trish is incredibly agile, possibly more so than Dante. She can jump many times higher than Dante in the first game and in Devil May Cry 4, she is seen maneuvering and dodging enemies by flipping through the crowd showing her dexterity by performing the splits while doing a hand stand. Supernatural durability: As with most demons, Trish can withstand more force before being hurt or injured. Supernatural endurance: Because she is a demon, Trish can put forth prolonged effort without needing to rest. Accelerated healing: Due to Trish's demonic biology, Trish can heal almost instantly from most wounds. Electricity generation and manipulation: Trish's demon power most commonly takes the form of yellow lightning (blue in the anime). She uses this lightning to augment her kicks and punches. She can fire this lighting as well as channel into various physical objects, like her guns, or Lady's rockets. She can also transfer her electricity to others.Abilities  Hand-to-Hand: Trish is extremely proficient and capable in unarmed combat. During her first meeting with Dante, she was able to fight Dante with a combination of hand-to-hand combat and her power over electricity. Trish uses punches and kicks, including jump kicks and handstand spin-kicks. Swordsmanship: Trish uses the Sword of Sparda as her main weapon and her skills with it rival Dante's. She also is shown to be able to kill Scarecrows with a small foldable dagger. Sharpshooter: Using Luce and Ombra, she can fire in two different directions and twirl around while all her shots hit her enemies. Master of Disguise: In Devil May Cry 4, Trish almost completely changed her appearance to a dark skinned woman with short white hair to infiltrate the Order of the Sword with no one recognizing her true identity.Arsenal  Luce & Ombra: Twin set of pistols customized for rapid fire that once belonged to Sparda. Sword of Sparda: Though she does not always use it, Trish commonly uses Sparda as her main melee weapon.Appearances in Other Media PlayStation 2  The save icon for Devil May Cry in the Playstation 2 system files is a chibi version of Trish. If the data is copied to another Memory Card, Trish starts dancing, if the data is to be deleted however, Trish starts waving with a frowny look.Devil May Cry 2 novel  Trish appears in an alternate universe where the world is ruled by demons. She is still part of Mundus' army, serving as his general, using Alastor as her weapon of choice. She leads a legion of demons against the rebellion led by Shadow. Due to events transpiring differently, she does not defect and is killed by Dante in the war, though he laments on having done so.Viewtiful Joe  Trish makes an appearances as a replacement for Sylvia in Dante's scenario. Then she reappears as an unlockable costume for Sylvia in the PSP version of Red Hot Rumble.Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds  She is a playable character in Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds and Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, wielding Sparda and Luce & Ombra. She has access to her Devil powers as well as moves such as the Round Trip. Trish's theme is a remix of Lock & Load, Dante's alternate fighting theme from the first game. Her alternate outfits include a red outfit with white hair, based on Dante, a white costume with silver hair, based on her alter ego, Gloria and a blue costume based on Sylvia from the Viewtiful Joe series. In Ultimate Marvel Vs. Capcom 3, Trish gains three more color scheme, an orange sheen, a pink one and a Vergil-themed scheme. Her Gloria color scheme becomes a full-fledged DLC outfit.SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters DS  Trish is a character card in SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighter DS.Playstation All-Stars Battle Royale  Trish appears as an unlockable icon in Playstation All-Stars Battle Royale. To unlock players must reach Rank 12 with Dante.Background  Trish's name is a reference to Lady Beatrice of the Divine Comedy, who was based on Dante Alighieri's muse and unrequited love, Beatrice Portinari. The Gloria (\"Glory be to God on high\" in Latin) is the second part of the Catholic Ordinary of the Mass. It is traditionally sung in Latin.Trivia See also Devil Trigger  Devil Trigger (often abbreviated to\u00a0D.T.) is a special power possessed by demons and demonic hybrids which allows them to release their full supernatural potential. While in Devil Trigger, the user will assume their true form. In this form, many of the character's physical and magical attributes are amplified, and the character may have access to upgrades or even additions to their normal abilities like flying or hovering. When playing on higher difficulties, enemies can enter a Devil Trigger-like state after a certain time limit (which is fixed for each enemy). This causes enemies to strengthen their attributes as well as making them attack more often and more powerful.Recurring Features  While in Devil Trigger, the characters' various stats like speed and strength increase, and they constantly recuperate vitality. Characters also gain deeper and distorted voices. Additional effects are apparent, though these vary between games, and are usually determined by the equipped weapons or items of the character. For example, Dante will usually gain the ability to hover while in Devil Trigger, but this is only obtained by equipping the Alastor in Devil May Cry, the Aerial Heart in Devil May Cry 2, and Nevan in Devil May Cry 3. Devil Trigger is confirmed to be available to Dante, Sparda, Lucia, Trish, Vergil and Nero. Several other characters, specifically Arkham, Credo, Agnus and Sanctus have abilities resembling Devil Trigger, though it is not known if it is actually the same term. In Devil May Cry 3 and Devil May Cry 4, activating Devil Trigger generates \"DT Explosion\" which causes enemies to take damage and consequently interrupt what they were doing. In Devil May Cry 3, the explosion can be charged by holding down  until the chosen number of Devil Trigger runes glow, and then releasing the button. Interestingly in Devil May Cry 4, Dante's DT activation doesn't deliver any damage. Also, when activating Devil Trigger, the character is granted temporary invincibility. In all but the second game, it is possible to unlock \"Super\" costumes for the playable characters, whose most prominent feature is their unlimited Devil Trigger. This allows the character to stay in Devil form indefinitely, taking advantage of the power, defense, and speed boosts, but negates the Devil Trigger's ability to regenerate (an exception being to Super Dante in the original game, Super Legendary Dark Knight and Super Corrupt Vergil, which still retains all devil trigger abilities without losing any runes.) In Devil May Cry 4, the Super costume also reduces the mission rating by a certain percentage when used.Devil Trigger Gauge  The Devil Trigger Gauge, often abbreviated as D.T. Gauge, shows how much demonic energy the character has with each character having unique gauge designs. It acts as a power bank, storing demonic energy to be released later. The Devil Trigger Gauge can be seen below the Vitality Gauge, and is represented as a line of runes. In all games the gauge appears as separate symbols, except for Devil May Cry 2 where it is represented as a bar. Most of the time, the player starts with only the necessary three runes to power their demonic form, though at least one exception does exist. The player can extend the D.T Gauge by buying Purple Orbs, allowing them to maintain their form for a longer period of time. The primary purpose of the DT Gauge is to activate, and sustain the Devil Trigger state. The amount of time the user can stay in Devil Trigger is determined by the length of the Devil Trigger Gauge. At least three runes must be filled in order to enter Devil Trigger. Once Devil Trigger is engaged, energy is drained from the gauge until the DT form is cancelled, either voluntarily or when the gauge runs out of energy. The Devil Trigger Gauge is usually filled by attacking enemies, although it can also be filled by Taunting, raising the Stylish Rank, utilizing Devil Stars, or standing on special platforms appearing in select locations in Devil May Cry and Devil May Cry 2. It is also possible to increase the gauge by taking damage in most games, though this is much riskier. Some techniques, weapons, items, and even enemies also deplete the gauge. The Bangle of Time and Quicksilver Style slow down time so that enemies move slower, but constantly reduce the D.T. gauge while in effect. Also, the Doppelganger Style slowly drains the gauge while in use. Using advanced Summoned Swords techniques as Vergil will also deplete the gauge. Some combat techniques, such as Stinger and Kick 13 in Devil May Cry 4 use part of the DT gauge to become more powerful. The Nightmare-\u03b2 consumes Devil Trigger when fired. Certain enemies, such as Nightmare and Nobodies, possess attacks that in addition to harming the player drains the Devil Trigger Gauge as well.Items affecting Devil Trigger  The Haywire Neo-Generator from Devil May Cry 3 causes Dante to constantly lose his Vitality in exchange for an infinite Devil Trigger that cannot be turned off. The Untouchable from Devil May Cry causes the player to become invulnerable while putting him into DT state for a short period of time.Characteristics Enemies  On the hardest mode in all games, Dante Must Die, enemies can use Devil Trigger. At any point during a fight, an enemy may exude a dark fiery aura and their eyes turn red. In this form, much like the player, they deal more damage and are harder to knock to the ground. They do not however regenerate health. In Devil May Cry 3 the aim in Mission 6 is to overcome three trials of the Temen-ni-gru, the Trial of Wisdom, the Trial of Skill, and the Trial of the Warrior. The Trial of the Warrior will consist of a long fight with demons in their Devil Trigger state, no matter the mode. However, their Devil Trigger can be temporarily disabled by unlocking seals on the walls. In Devil May Cry 4, demonic bosses have a \"Desperation Mode\", similar to Devil Trigger, when they are low on health. However, it seems to be something separate from normal enemy Devil Trigger, as it appears on all modes. Effects of it vary for each boss;Dante  Dante's exact Devil Trigger form changes throughout the series, though it seems to resemble his father more strongly as the series progresses (although in Devil May Cry 2 & onwards his normal Devil Trigger seems to resemble his human attire, most notably his long coat). In Devil May Cry and Devil May Cry 3, the appearance and attributes of the Devil Trigger form is dependent on the Devil Arm the character is wielding at the time of assumption, while in other games Dante will possess one or two default forms assumed to be his \"true\" forms. For more information on how Dante obtains Devil Trigger and detailed differences in each game, see below.Alastor  In Devil May Cry, Dante cannot use his Devil Trigger until he obtains his first Devil Arm, Alastor. Unlike in Devil May Cry 3, his demonic forms are mature appearances of the Demon whose power he is channeling; Alastor, Ifrit, and even Sparda. However, although his Demonic aura manifests in Sparda's form at several points in the story, he is not able to use Devil Trigger with the Sword of Sparda until he goes up against Mundus. Unlike in later games, Dante appears as a human surrounded by the weapon's aura while in Devil Trigger, and only takes on a demonic form while attacking. In the aerial battle with Mundus, Dante has unlimited access to his father's demon form and fires red, Meteor-like energy balls, and uses Vortex for melee and evasion. He can also summon an enormous dragon at the expense of the energy is the Devil Trigger gauge.Ifrit  In Devil May Cry, Dante cannot use his Devil Trigger until he obtains his first Devil Arm, Alastor. Unlike in Devil May Cry 3, his demonic forms are mature appearances of the Demon whose power he is channeling; Alastor, Ifrit, and even Sparda. However, although his Demonic aura manifests in Sparda's form at several points in the story, he is not able to use Devil Trigger with the Sword of Sparda until he goes up against Mundus. Unlike in later games, Dante appears as a human surrounded by the weapon's aura while in Devil Trigger, and only takes on a demonic form while attacking. In the aerial battle with Mundus, Dante has unlimited access to his father's demon form and fires red, Meteor-like energy balls, and uses Vortex for melee and evasion. He can also summon an enormous dragon at the expense of the energy is the Devil Trigger gauge.Sparda  In Devil May Cry, Dante cannot use his Devil Trigger until he obtains his first Devil Arm, Alastor. Unlike in Devil May Cry 3, his demonic forms are mature appearances of the Demon whose power he is channeling; Alastor, Ifrit, and even Sparda. However, although his Demonic aura manifests in Sparda's form at several points in the story, he is not able to use Devil Trigger with the Sword of Sparda until he goes up against Mundus. Unlike in later games, Dante appears as a human surrounded by the weapon's aura while in Devil Trigger, and only takes on a demonic form while attacking. In the aerial battle with Mundus, Dante has unlimited access to his father's demon form and fires red, Meteor-like energy balls, and uses Vortex for melee and evasion. He can also summon an enormous dragon at the expense of the energy is the Devil Trigger gauge.Dante  In Devil May Cry 2 Dante can transform into his Demonic form from the very beginning, and it is also unaffected by the weapon he has equipped. However, he can modify its abilities using the Amulet item. Although this demonic form has a more matured appearance compared to the one used in Devil May Cry 3, it has not quite reached its final state. However, Dante can sometimes access that state, his Majin Form, if he activates his Devil Trigger while at critical health. Dante's Majin Form strongly resembles his father's Demonic form, as well as his brother's \"Nelo Angelo\" form, but its wings are reptilian/chiropteran, rather than insectoid. While Dante is in this form, he possesses complete invulnerability.Lucia  Lucia's demonic form is an angelic and\u00a0dove-like\u00a0with a\u00a0long white bang covering her right eye, two sets of bird wings and talons for feet. She possesses a teal-colored eye with black skin.\u00a0Her melee weapons are replaced with glowing versions of Cutlasseer and are enhanced by Amulets. Her\u00a0ranged weapons are replaced with her feathers.Secretary  Due to being a similar demon crated by Arius, the Secretary's D.T. is similar in a appearance and function to Lucia's. The biggest\u00a0difference\u00a0being that their feathers are\u00a0a deep violet color giving it a crow-like appearance,\u00a0 and they have a feathered head crest, similar to the masks they wear. They have dense,\u00a0plumed collars and and their melee weapons glow yellow-orange as opposed to Lucia's blue.Trish  Trish does not undergo through physical changes in Devil Trigger, but rather gains a hazy,\u00a0yellow aura which covers her entire body and she puts on her sunglasses. She gains access to Air Raid, during which she can use a Vortex-like technique and fire yellow lightning bolts.Super Mode  Devil May Cry 2 lacks \"Super\" costumes, but the HD Collection release allows the player to input a code to grant them access to indefinite Devil Trigger. Once the \"Must Die Mode\" is completed for a specific character, Super Mode can be activated when selecting a mission or the Bloody Palace. Hold +++ while selecting the game mode, then continue holding them while also holding  to select a stage. All five buttons should be held until the stage starts, at which point the Devil Trigger activation sound will play. While in Super Mode, Devil Trigger will not heal the player character, nor can Dante use his Majin Form.Devil May Cry 3  In Devil May Cry 3, Dante gains the ability to Devil Trigger after his first fight with Vergil. After losing to his brother, Dante is impaled with Rebellion. His blood awakens his demon power and he is able to transform, and becomes much more powerful. Dante's demonic forms are quite humanoid, though its exact features, its general facial structure, cranial crest and the fins on its back vary with the weapon he has equipped.Rebellion  Dante's Rebellion Devil Trigger is red and black, his chin-length, snowy hair turns into a tusk-like crest, and his body physique is much more bare. His coat tails either function like his trench coat or open up to spread out (the wings leave a black spot near Dante's torso) and give him flight. He also has his coat's \"Lapel\" changed into white-colored ones, his feet have clawed toe-nails and gains a red, foggy aura. While in this form, Dante gains a decent boost across all his stats making this Devil Trigger the most well-rounded one.Cerberus  Dante's Cerberus Devil Trigger is mainly red with a bright blue skeletal system, with his wings changing into a pair of vertical, strip-like wings, his cranial crest points up into two and gets a thinner design, and he has a cyan, foggy-like aura. While in this form, Dante gains augmented speed to his specific weapon (makes him agile just like a wolf and the devil arm's soul) compared to Dante's other demonic weapons.Agni & Rudra  Dante's Agni & Rudra Devil Trigger has energy streams that glow orange on one half of his body and light blue on the other, representing the power of the twin demons and the twin swords. His coat is altered with two straps formed near the center of his front torso, spikes protrude from the red streaks on his\u00a0legs, arms and back, and he has a spiked crest, giving him a serrated look similar to the blades.\u00a0Dante gains enhanced physical strength and elemental properties and Dante takes on an orange foggy-like aura.Nevan  Dante's Nevan Devil Trigger is red and purple with many features, including pointed sleeves, a Y-shaped imprint along his chest, and a facial structure that resembles a horned/bladed helmet. He gains a greater regeneration ability and has a purple, foggy-like aura and keeps the wings from the Rebellion D.T.Beowulf  Dante's Beowulf Devil Trigger is red and white, it has a look resembling the Cerberus D.T. (most possibly that it is another weapon that is based from a feral animal) however, much different in its cranial structure. The Beowulf Devil Trigger gives Dante a white, foggy-like aura and improved defense.Advanced Styles  When Dante is bestowed the \"Advanced Styles\" Doppelganger Style and Quicksilver Style, he can demonstrate unimaginable, god-like feats at the cost of D.T. Runes (noticeably the energy and effort drains Dante's power) and is the only time Dante can use Devil Trigger with it.Yamato  Vergil's Devil Trigger is first seen during his second battle with Dante, in the Lair of Judgment, although in the Special Edition, it can be used from the beginning when playing as him. Like Dante, Vergil's demonic form keeps the design of a blue, humanoid creature, and the design varies with each weapon, excluding Force Edge. Also, in the Yamato demonic form, Vergil possesses traits that are similar to Dante's Rebellion form, but it has several white imprints detailed on the trench coat with the three coat tails separating into four (with its design when airborne being bat-esque wings), his spiky hair changes into a crest that has a fin shape at the top, his neck gains a membrane that curves inwards, the spine merges with two dark-colored bones exposed at the top as well, his sheathe alters and attaches to his sleeve while becoming a clawed appendage, and his vest changes to a undercoat. Also, Vergil's feet are unchanged but darkened, he obtains a bright blue aura and his teeth are fangs that show.Beowulf  Vergil's Beowulf Devil Trigger is mainly blue and glows white. Vergil gains new features that Dante's Beowulf demon form has, such as vertical strip-like wings, but has an additional pair to them, he keeps his blue \"coat\" and his cranial crest flats to a thinner crest. Also, if Vergil activates D.T, the sound will be identical to a basic enemy Devil Triggering in DMC3's Dante Must Die mode.Devil May Cry: The Animated Series  In the anime, Dante initially never used the power of his demonic side. However, during the final battle with the demon Abigail, these two went toe-to-toe airborne and Dante unleashes his full power, thus gave him glowing red eyes and gaining a deeper voice (a recurring effect of Devil Trigger). The showcase of power induced an explosion, which stripped Sid of his demon form, leaving him vulnerable for Dante to later shoot. The detransforming is possibly inspired by the effect of the Majin form.Dante  In Devil May Cry 4, Dante is able to transform into his demonic form in his very first appearance, in which he is attacked by Nero, and it is unaffected by the weapon he has equipped. This demonic form is very reptilian; it gives a reptile-looking appearance to Dante's arms and legs, his head seems to produce spiky edges, there are cracks on his chest, and his \"coat\" is a pair of curled up semi-chiropteran wings with each divided into three segments. He is much more powerful in this form, attacking with greater force and speed, firing magically charged shots from his guns, infusing some of his attacks with extra demonic energy to enhance the move at the cost of instantly consuming part of his DT gauge: namely, Stinger (which covers a greater area and drills through enemies), Kick 13 (which gains additional kicks and ends with two rising kicks) and Pin-up (which pulls twice as many blades). Dante also becomes able to use Air Hike and Sky Star twice in one jump to gain greater altitude and aerial distance before falling. He also becomes extremely resistant to stun, and receives much less damage from attacks. In other words, most attacks that hit him will not interrupt his attacks; therefore any skills that require charging (particularly Gilgamesh) will be constant despite his taking damage. However, some stronger moves (like Berial's flame pillar attack) can still knock him off balance.Nero  Nero, the main protagonist of Devil May Cry 4, also receives a Devil Trigger. He gains his Devil Trigger in Mission 6 after defeating Agnus. While Nero demands answers from the scientist, Agnus\u2019s servants, the Bianco Angelos, catch him unaware and impale him with their lances. Agnus then tells Nero of his plans, and stabs him once more with a Gladius. Nero almost fades away, but suddenly remembers a moment from his past. Kyrie was endangered, and Nero, in despair, cried out to her. He awaken and resurrects subsequently restoring and claims Yamato then proceeds to evoke his Devil Trigger. When activated, it seems to resemble a translucent shadow of a demon that floats behind Nero. The demon has \"sheath\" attached to its left arm, which holds in Yamato when not in use. Nero himself, gains burning red eyes, and a deeper, echoing voice. He also gains a hazy, blue aura that pulsates with an intensity relevant to the amount of Exceed Nero has charged. At a full charge, each pulse releases a small, black hazy aura. In terms of combat, Nero's Red Queen attack will be accompanied by the demon using a right-handed version of the attack, his Buster will have more gruesome animations and will deal more damage, he will also use convene Summoned Swords every time he fires his pistol. While in his Devil Trigger state he is also granted limited use to the Yamato while in combat. Unfortunately (and unlike Dante), while in Devil Trigger, Nero can and will still be stunned by any attack, even those from weak demons such as a Scarecrow. At first, the creators of the game were going to give Nero an actual demon form, closely resembling the ghostly blue demon behind him when he uses his Devil Trigger, but decided to stay with the translucent form. When the game was released, they included a book filled with character references, one of them being Nero's original Devil Trigger.Trish  Trish is capable of using Devil Trigger. She only gains a golden aura while donning her sunglasses, much like her Devil May Cry 2 incarnation. When in this state she gains access to faster attack speed, heightened attack strength, and her health slowly regenerates.\u00a0During usage of Devil Trigger bullets from Luce & Ombra will generate electric field after hitting the target.Vergil  Vergil's Devil Trigger is similar in appearance and function to the one in Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition. It also retains the function from Devil May Cry 3 that allows his Devil Trigger to change forms depending on the Devil Arm he is using. While in Devil Trigger, Vergil's power and speed are drastically increased and his attacks gain additional properties that make them stronger (like Rapid Slash, which can be canceled into itself and embeds Summoned Swords into enemies that explode after Vergil sheathes Yamato), while having slow health regeneration. Some of his moves are only accessible while in Devil Trigger, like Judgement Cut End and two additional hits at the end of Yamato Combo A. Like Dante, he can spend part of his Devil Trigger Gauge to increase the power of some of his moves, namely Stinger (which covers a far greater area and drills through enemies) and Lunar Phase (which ends with a Rising Sun-esque pair of kicks if used in the ground, and has far more spins if used in the air).DmC: Devil May Cry  Like in Devil May Cry 4, the Devil Trigger of DmC: Devil May Cry varies starkly between its two users, Dante and Vergil. While it grants both of them health regeneration, greater strength, and the ability to ignore the invulnerability of color-coded enemies, Dante's Devil Trigger focuses on slowing the flow of time and tossing lesser demons into the air, while Vergil's Devil Trigger focuses on generating a doppelganger that can either mimic Vergil's actions or act on its own. Devil Trigger is powered by a meter that fills when dealing damage, and quickly depletes while Devil Trigger is active. When activated, a small chunk of the meter is always consumed, and will disappear even if DT is prematurely ended. However, after that initial burst, the meter will drain at a slower pace. For a still unknown reason, Dante and Vergil are unable to enter Devil Trigger if they lose the pendants their mother Eva gave them.Dante  Dante's Devil Trigger in the DmC universe is different from the DT of the numbered games. In this state, Dante uses what resembles a modified version of the Quicksilver Style, slowing down time and causing the world to be flooded with flowing light. Instead of transforming into a demon, Dante's hair flushes white, while the sclera of his eyes and his coat glow with a blood red aura. In addition to this, he leaves fiery red footprints whenever he touches the ground. At the beginning of a Devil Trigger, all minor enemies are launched into the air where they float prone, allowing Dante to unleash a flurry of aerial combos. Dante can then slam all floating enemies against the ground and relaunch all grounded enemies using Eryx's stomp. Against bosses, however, additional different combat options can be accessed by using Devil Trigger, like new grapple points becoming available, or slowing down the boss' attacks.Vergil  Vergil is also capable of Devil Trigger, which he can perform so long as he possesses his pendant. Although his Devil Trigger increases his power, speed, and Vitality regeneration like Dante's, Vergil's Devil Trigger illuminates him within a ghostly blue aura, and focuses on generating a shadowy doppelganger rather than slowing time. Vergil is able to cause a delay between his attacks and the doppelganger's responses, as well as to force the Doppelganger to work within a certain moveset; from its default black state in which it copies Vergil's moves exactly, it can be changed to a white state that uses the standard versions of his techniques, a blue state that uses the Angel versions, and a red state that uses the Demon versions. During both gameplay and cut scenes, Vergil activates his Devil Trigger by plunging Yamato into the ground. However, as noted by Kat, the continuous use of this power seems to slowly devour the Nephilim's humanity, little by little transforming them from the inside by the vast amounts of demonic energy they are channeling. As evidenced by Dante who was nearly going to kill his own brother if not stopped by Kat, and when Vergil saved his own mother from torture just to tell her that he didn't have a heart anymore.Devil May Cry 5 Dante  In Devil May Cry 5, Dante's demonic form is largely identical to his form in Devil May Cry 4, with some minor stylistic changes. Just like in the previous installments of the series, Dante is capable of restoring his health points while using it. Devil Trigger also enchants all of his attacks with additional damage output and allows him to fly around with the wings. Using various buttons during the flight will give completely different attacks and combinations of them. Additionally the flight enchants the speed of Dante's movement. Dante's appearance in his demonic form will stay the same no matter which weapon he will equip. Additionally, during Devil Trigger, he will not take the form of Sparda while using the Sword of Sparda.Other appearances Viewtiful Joe  The spirit of the Alastor Devil Arm appears as Blade Master Alastor in Viewtiful Joe where he has his own Devil Trigger.Marvel vs. Capcom 3  In Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds, Dante can activate the Devil Trigger as a Hyper Combo that lasts for 10 seconds, increasing the damage he can deal by 15% and granting him minor health regeneration. The Rebellion Devil Trigger is used for the model, though the Sparda Devil Trigger is used instead with Dante's DLC Costume for the game. Dante can perform two of Nevan's techniques in DT mode, and gains the ability to fly. He also gains a third jump added to his double jump, and gains the ability to dash twice in the air before landing. Dante can also tag out to keep his Devil Trigger effect permanent, unless tagged back in. Plus, his sound clips are only limited to deep roars and his taunt has no dialogue until it wears off. This appears to be a throwback to Ragna the Bloodedge's Blood Kain Distortion Drive from Blazblue, as Ragna is somewhat based on Dante. Vergil also uses Devil Trigger as a Level 1 Hyper Combo and although it does not allow him any new special moves like Dante, if the player has a remaining three bars of HC Gauge they may activate Dark Angel. This Hyper Combo shows Vergil slashing the opponent while Summoned Swords accumulate in the background. Finally, he returns back to his human form and sheathes Yamato as the Swords pierce the enemy. This is the only move in the game that requires four HC Gauges total (including the transformation) and is the stronger Hyper Combo in the game, taking 610,000 points off of the opponent's health. The ability also increases his damage output by 20%, enables minor health regeneration, increases the size of the hitboxes on a few of his moves, gives him an air dash, and gives him a double jump. Despite having the ability during Devil May Cry 2, Trish does not have any Devil Trigger in the game.Marvel Vs. Capcom: Infinite  Dante's Devil Trigger returns once more as one of Dante's Hypers during gameplay, functioning identically to how it did in the previous game. In the game's story mode, Dante assumes his Devil Trigger form to fight Jedah Dohma, with the entire fight granting the player permanent Devil Trigger. With the massive boost in power, he's able to overpower the demon noble and wrest the Soul Stone from his control. Initially, his mind starts to succumb to the power of the Stone, but ultimately fights it off and at that same moment, figures out the best way to defeat Ultron Sigma, taking Jedah's words about the Stone into consideration before he leaves. Interestingly, this is the first time Dante talks in full sentences during the form rather than taunts, shouts and growling.Playstation All-Stars Battle Royale  Dante's Devil Trigger operates identically to in DmC: Devil May Cry; upon activation, Dante's hair changes white and his coat is stained blood-red, although the veins on his face do not pop. Meanwhile, the scenery fades into monochrome and enemies float helplessly in mid-air until they are attacked, and are killed with only one hit. It is useful to use your guns as they have long range.Development  The Devil Trigger forms seen in Devil May Cry 3 were designed by Kazuma Kaneko, a character designer for Atlus who designed the characters and demons for the Shin Megami Tensei series. This was done as part of a deal to have Dante included as a cameo in Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne, as Kaneko is a big fan of the Devil May Cry series. The Devil May Cry 4 Devil's Material Collection showcases a handful of concept sketches of Devil Trigger for both Dante and Nero. Concepts for the former notably include both wings and a tail whilst the latter shows a full devil form that bears many similarities to Vergil's Yamato Devil Trigger, including a claw-like sheath on the arm and wing-like coattails.See also Sparda (Devil Arm)  Sparda and its unawakened form, the Force Edge, is the beloved demon-forged sword wielded by the Dark Knight Sparda himself, and magically imbued with his power. Throughout the series, the sword is recognized as a source of god-like power, and in both Devil May Cry 3 and Devil May Cry 4, it was the main objective of the villains. It is Dante's default weapon in Devil May Cry, and Trish's in Devil May Cry 2 and 4 Special Edition. In addition, Vergil is able to summon spectral versions of the Force Edge as his Summoned Swords.Appearance  The sword of Sparda has two forms: Force Edge and Sparda. Force Edge, the unawakened form, resembles a basic sword. The guard takes a \"W\" shape, vaguely resembling Sparda's horns. It has a spiral handle that leads to four skulls on the pommel with a spike at the top. In its awakened state, Sparda keeps the handle and cross-guard, but the spike on the skulls is split in half, with the frontward, more elaborate half forming a small blade that curves around the bottom of Sparda's blade (in Devil May Cry, the front half is a simple hook). Force Edge's blade is replaced with a spine-like structure attached to two curved blades via an organic looking substance. Together the blades form one long blade when in sword mode. The top portion has a large glowing red gem-like object in the center. The other side has two significantly smaller gems, glowing orange and pink. Sparda's blades can reorient themselves to give Sparda various shapes to suit its needs. Dante and Trish shift the halves to create a scythe for Round Trip and point both blades forward for a spear for Stinger. In the upcoming Devil May Cry 5 game, Sparda has gone through major design changes, but still kept some of its old appearance, including a thick organic hide, the curved blade andthe color scheme of its guard. However, the sword now has a realistic spinal column instead of the one that was telescopic, with some bone matter covers below its guard. Its larger red jewel has moved to the side and a green one is now below it, and the handle is darker than before.Story  The Sparda was originally wielded by the Dark Knight Sparda himself, but when he closed the gate between the Human and Demon Worlds, he also sealed his demonic power inside his beloved sword in order to ensure the strength of the seal. Sparda also took the Perfect Amulet, causing the sword's own natural powers to fall asleep and become the Force Edge. Many centuries later, however, Arkham conspired to obtain the sword, and through it, Sparda's power, which he would use to rule the world. He manages to manipulate Dante, Vergil, and Lady into allowing him to obtain the Perfect Amulet and opening the gate to the Netherworld for him, thus allowing him to both acquire the sword and awaken its power. After drawing the sword, he takes the form of Sparda, but because it does not resonate with him like it later did with Dante and Sanctus, and his inhumanity, he was unable to control its immense power and mutates into a hideous, blob-like form, which is quickly slain by Dante and Vergil. As Arkham's demonic form dissolves, the Force Edge and Perfect Amulet fall further into the Netherworld, and both Dante and Vergil dive after them. They fight over the weapon, and though Vergil is defeated, he retains his half of the amulet. Dante then returns to the Human World with the Force Edge. Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening Dante takes up the Force Edge as his own sword, calling it \"Woozy\" and takes it with him to the castle on Mallet Island in the Rebellion's stead. Throughout his mission there, he periodically encounters the dark knight Nelo Angelo, who is mysteriously shaken when he notices Dante's part of the amulet. After Nelo Angelo is finally defeated and revealed as Vergil, Dante obtains the other half of the amulet and the Sparda is reawakened. It later allows him to take Sparda's form in the final battle with Mundus. Afterward, he plants the sword as a memorial to the seemingly dead Trish, but when Trish is later revealed to be alive and carrying the sword, he allows her to keep it. Devil May Cry When not in use, Trish leaves the Sparda hanging on the wall of Devil May Cry. After Lady explains the problems she is having with the Order of the Sword to Dante and Trish, Trish takes the sword and leaves without asking Dante's permission. Disguised as Gloria, she gives the Sparda to Sanctus in order to win his trust and infiltrate the Order, since they need the sword in order to empower their greatest tool, The Savior. Sanctus later resonates with the weapon and uses it against Nero, though his inhumanity does not allow him to fully control it. After Nero defeats Sanctus and rescues Kyrie from being used as the core of The Savior, he gives the Sparda back to its rightful owner, Dante. Devil May Cry 4Gameplay  In Devil May Cry, Force Edge is Dante's starting sword and is the weakest weapon in the game. It also has the most limited moveset, which consists of basic combos and attacks available at the start of the game and lacks a Devil Trigger due to its dormant nature. No attacks purchased for Alastor transfer to Force Edge. As Sparda, the sword has the longest reach of all of Dante\u2019s melee weapons and is the strongest of the swords while not in Devil Trigger. It gains the ability to change forms by shifting its parts into different positions, changing into either a spear for stabbing attacks or scythe for Round Trip. Sparda\u2019s moveset is adapted from Alastor\u2019s non-DT combo list, with the exception of Air Hike. Combo 2 is finished with a Stinger-like thrust instead of a slash. Devil Trigger is only available during the Mundus boss fight. During phase one,\u00a0Dante is permanently in an Air Raid-like flight, firing energy balls and can perform a Vortex-like spin. Dante\u2019s strongest technique during phase one is an energy constructed dragon called Puff.\u00a0The Devil Trigger gauge is used to measure how strong the Puff is and is activated the way DT would normally be activated. It will break through Mundus\u2019 shield and stop whatever attack he may be performing. Dante is immune to any attacks launched at him for the duration of the Puff attack animation. During the second phase, the Sparda sword\u2019s Devil Trigger focuses on energy attacks and enhancements to Dante\u2019s attacks. His gunshots are replaced by a Meteor-style energy attack while Dante is on the ground. Sparda\u2019s reach is extended by demonic energy emanating from the sword. In Devil May Cry 2, the Force Edge is used as a standard sword for Dante's Devil May Cry costume, however, it is just a cosmetic re-skin of Rebellion and will operate in the same manner. Trish uses Sparda as her melee weapon and functions the same as it did in Devil May Cry, though she doesn't have its Devil Trigger. During Round Trip, Sparda will move to whatever enemy is being targeted after Trish throws it and she can also plant Sparda in the ground so that she can use hand to hand combat. In Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition, Force Edge is a re-skin for Rebellion in Dantes Devil May Cry and \"Legendary Dark Knight\" costumes. Vergil uses Force Edge in conjunction with Yamato. While using Force Edge, Vergil possesses a similar attack style to Dante's, albeit with a smaller moveset. He does, however, have access to Round Trip. In Devil May Cry 4, Sanctus Diabolica uses Sparda in a crude manner. He will occasionally swipe the sword once or twice after his energy shield is taken down. He will also use the sword as a physical shield, which can be Bustered to break this guard. When low on health, Sanctus will use a Stinger-like sword thrust that can be countered with a well-timed Buster. In Devil May Cry 4 Special Edition, Vergil utilizes Force Edge much as he did in his Devil May Cry 3 incarnation, but he has more attacks, like Million Stab, Drive and Overdrive. His Drive is a mid-range attack that requires no charge time and will double swipe on execution. Overdrive can be charged and coats Force Edge in energy before launching a slow-moving but powerful wave of energy. His Million Stab is accessible via Combo A or Stinger. Stinger itself has a shorter range than Dante\u2019s but can also be used midair and overall has more power. Round Trip can be used on the ground and midair, but is used as a mid-range attack, and will only travel a set distance away from Vergil with no tracking. This requires better positioning to be used effectively. Despite its travel distance, it creates a vacuum-like vortex that pulls nearby enemies in. Having a higher level on the Concentration Gauge gives Force Edge multi-hit properties and expands the area of effect of Round Trip. Combo A is much like its original attack. Combo B is an extended combo, similar to a Crazy Combo, in which Vergil chases down the targeted enemy, swinging both Force Edge and Yamato. It can be steered while not locked on and will not negatively affect the Concentration Gauge until the final strike. The Concentration Gauge adds a multi-hit effect to all of Force Edge's attacks. Trish uses Sparda as its own melee weapon and in conjunction with Bare Knuckle, her hand to hand techniques. It has combos and attacks similar to Force Edge and Rebellion with a few differences. Sparda Combo A, High Time, and Aerial Rave are all the same as Dante\u2019s Rebellion. The second strike of Combo B hits enemies all around Trish and is followed up by a two Drive like swings, however, they don\u2019t have any long-distance properties. The final strike is a stab, which can be followed up by transforming Sparda into its spear form for a secondary stab. Bare Knuckle Combo A ends with up to three Drive strikes. It can be charged into Maximum Overdrive and strike up to eleven times before the end. Sparda is used to finish off Bare Knuckle Combo B with a flurry of strikes similar to Dance Macabre. The final strike is a golf club-like swing on the enemy but has a long start-up and recovery animation so it should not be used when too many enemies are near-by. Sparda\u2019s greatest asset is Round Trip. It has the longest range and longest active time of any iteration seen in the series so far. Unlike previous entries, it is activated by a Lock-On++Sparda prompt, allowing for the fastest execution of the technique followed by a quick start-up. It has a wide range and is capable of constantly stunning most enemies caught in its area of effect. While they are stunned Trish can attack the enemy at that same time with an alternate Bare Knuckle moveset. Upon its return, depending on what part of the combo Trish is in, it will reset and begin her default Bare Knuckle combo. It has a gauge to mark how long it will be before the sword makes its way back to Trish, but can be recalled manually by pressing the Sparda attack button. V Divider can be used pull in enemies and can be executed mid-air, during the short time that Sparda is away, Trish has access to her alternate Bare Knuckle moveset.Other appearances Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds and Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3  The awakened Sparda is used by Trish and the dormant form is used at the same time by Vergil and by Dante in his alternate costume.Sengoku Basara  Sanada Yukimura's sixth weapon is two Sparda swords. Along with the Sparda, Yukimura is equipped with the Ifrit as arm guards.Devil May Cry Volume One  The Force Edge is Tony Redgrave's primary weapon.\u00a0MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD  The Force Edge can be crafted by the player\u00a0during one of events.\u00a0Trivia Characters in the Devil May Cry series Lead Characters Recurring Characters Devil May Cry boss Devil May Cry 2 Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening Devil May Cry 4 Devil May Cry 5 Devil May Cry manga Devil May Cry: The Animated Series DmC: Devil May Cry Yamato  The Yamato is Vergil's trademark dark-forged blade appearing in Devil May Cry, Devil May Cry 3, and Devil May Cry 4. It is a legendary sword that was once wielded by his father, Sparda, and was left to Vergil as a keepsake.Description  Yamato is a katana with an ornate bronze guard; the exact details of how it looks change throughout the series. In the first Devil May Cry the Tsuka (\u67c4, Tsuka lit. \"handle\") has the traditional gold wrapping, with black ornaments, and the Tsuba (\u9354, Tsuba lit. \"guard\") is octagonal. In later installments, the guard is an oval, and the tsuka-ito seems to be braided from white and dark blue material. The blade features several intricate ornaments, most notable is a relief of a dragon at the endpoint of the hilt. The inside and back of Nero's Devil Bringer mimics the design of the blade's hilt. The scabbard is black, made of traditional lacquered wood, and features several metallic ornaments on its far end. In Devil May Cry 3 it also features a yellow sageo, the cord used to tie the katana to the waist. In Devil Trigger, Vergil and Nero have different, but similar designs for the scabbard. For Vergil, it alters to appear similar to the sheath of a Kris, an Indonesian traditional dagger, and is colored dark blue. It attaches to an additional appendage on his left arm, and it can adjust position to allow Vergil to draw or sheathe his sword quicker and thus leaves Vergil's left hand free to wield the blade or other weapons. For Nero, the sheathe appears to be more segmented, but it is otherwise identical. Despite having a scabbard, Yamato is only occasionally worn on the waist; Vergil and Dante carry it with their hands during battle (though Vergil has been shown to wear it on his waist when not in use), Nero absorbs the Yamato within his Devil Bringer, and Sparda used to strap it to his back when he was alive.Powers  Although Yamato resembles a katana, it is even sharper than the Japanese blade, and is imbued with tremendous magic. The sword is said to be able to cut through anything, even the very fabric of space itself. The only things capable of stopping Yamato's strikes are objects powered by demonic energy comparable to the user's, such as the Rebellion or individuals powered by the Sword of Sparda. As such, when the user is weakened, the sword's ability to cut through anything also fades. This was seen in the end of Mission 13, when Lady blocked Vergil's slash with Kalina Ann. Vergil utilizes an ability called Judgement Cut in which he swings so fast that Yamato doesn't appear to even leave its sheath. It creates a distortion in space that engulfs his target which is sliced multiple times by the blade in very rapid succession. The ability is capable of hitting any enemies that are within the rather large distortion radius. Dante attempts to imitate this move in Devil May Cry 4 and the result is a similar ability called Slash Dimension but it lacks the precision and potency of Judgement Cut due to Dante's inexperience with wielding Yamato, unlike Vergil. Both abilities are able to strike far away opponents. Dante and Vergil demonstrate Yamato's ability to cut far away enemies with normal swings as well. Vergil, during Dante's battle with Arkham where Vergil appears and slices Arkham's hand off from atop a pillar a good distance away, and Dante, when he uses it to destroy the Hellgate with a single swing from a great distance away in Devil May Cry 4. Similar to Dante's Rebellion, the Yamato is able (to an extent) to bring out it wielder's true potential. This is shown in Devil May Cry 4 during Mission 7. As Nero was about to die as the hands of Agnus' Bianco Angelos, his Devil Bringer resonated with broken Yamato and restored it, something not even Agnus could do. The sword awakened Nero's power, allowing him to access a Devil Trigger of his own. Similar to the Sword of Sparda before it, Yamato was used to seal a pathway to the Demon World\u2014in this case the Hell Gate on Fortuna. The gate is reopened by the Order of the Sword using Yamato, but later destroyed by Dante, using the same blade.Story  Yamato once belonged to Vergil's father, Sparda, and according to the Order of the Sword, it was used to seal the \"true Hell Gate\". It was eventually given to Vergil as a memento, and he used it as his primary weapon. Devil May Cry 4 Vergil uses Yamato as his primary weapon while attempting to reactivate the Temen-ni-gru. When his attempt fails, Vergil falls into the Demon World with Yamato, where he is found by Mundus. Vergil attempts to defeat the demon king like his father, but is defeated and reborn as Nelo Angelo. Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening At some later point\u00a0Yamato was found\u00a0by the Order of the Sword -\u00a0shattered. It was kept in Agnus's Containment Room within Fortuna Castle, but is restored and taken by Nero when his dormant powers as an heir to Sparda emerge, and thereafter, Nero is able to use the sword while in Devil Trigger. However, it is taken back from him by Sanctus when he is absorbed into the Savior, and is then used by Agnus to reopen the Hell Gate. After slaying Agnus, Dante retrieves Yamato from the gate seal and uses it to destroy the gate, after which he wields it while in his Dark Slayer Style. While fighting the Savior, Dante uses the blade to free Nero, and sends it back to him so that the youth can finish the fight against Sanctus. After the battle, Dante charges Nero with keeping it. Devil May Cry 4Gameplay  Although Yamato is said to be able to cut through anything, this aspect does not carry through to gameplay for obvious reasons. Enemies with shields, such as Dullahans, are still invulnerable, and background objects are not affected.Dark Slayer Style  Yamato is intimately linked to Vergil's signature Dark Slayer Style, which he uses in Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition and which Dante homages in Devil May Cry 4. As a warrior fallen from grace, Vergil can use the power of darkness to obtain new weapons and skills by leveling the style, and it interacts with his Yamato, Summoned Swords, Beowulf, and Force Edge. The style itself performs much like Dante's Trickster Style. In Devil May Cry 4, Dante obtains this style after receiving Yamato, but instead of being based on teleportation, it allows Dante to imitate Vergil's skills with Yamato.Devil May Cry  In Devil May Cry, Yamato is only used for Dante's \"Legendary Dark Knight\" costume. It behaves exactly the same as the Alastor, even to the point that Sparda carries it on his back when not in use and wields it as a broadsword rather than using the Iaido technique. When Sparda enters Devil Trigger, Yamato transforms into the Sparda sword.Devil May Cry 3  Vergil is the only character to use Yamato in Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition. When Vergil fights with Yamato, he uses both the scabbard and the blade in the Iaido style. When the Force Edge is equipped, Vergil fights with the Force Edge in place of the Yamato's scabbard. For Vergil's \"Corrupt Vergil\" or \"Super Corrupt Vergil\" costumes, Yamato transforms into Nelo Angelo's zweih\u00e4nder when in Devil Trigger. This may also be related to how Yamato was broken between Devil May Cry 3 and Devil May Cry 4.Devil May Cry 4  Both Dante and Nero wield Yamato in Devil May Cry 4. Nero's use of Yamato is limited to when he is in Devil Trigger, and even then he only has a few attacks with it. While in Devil Trigger, Yamato also grants Nero the ability to use Summoned Swords. In contrast to Vergil and Dante's use of the Iaido technique, Nero wields Yamato without its scabbard. When Dante obtains Yamato, he gains access to Vergil's signature Dark Slayer Style. In the Special Edition of Devil May Cry 4, Vergil wields Yamato once more, and has by far the most extensive and relentless arsenal of moves, incorporating both sword and scabbard in a refinement of the Dark Slayer style, including his infamous Judgement Cut.Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition  It is worth noting, that after executing Yamato Combo, Upper Slash or Force Edge Combo, if Vergil is able to successfully complete the sheathing animation, he will gain a Devil Trigger Orb and a small increase to Style points as well. Also, performing a taunt with Yamato equipped, while there are enemies around, will cause Vergil to emit a black aura after a few seconds, that will replenish his Devil Trigger gauge on its own, as long as he is unharmed and stays in the taunting stance.Background  Yamato (\u5927\u548c, Yamato) is a Japanese term meaning \"great harmony\", referring to the people and traditional nationalistic spirit of Japan, and in the past to the nation itself. Yamato was also the name of a culturally significant ship in the Japanese Imperial Navy, one of the most powerfully armed battleships ever constructed. Thus, it is appropriate as the name of the weapon symbolizing Vergil's personal aesthetic and commitment to tradition and power, as opposed to Dante's personality of resistance symbolized by the Rebellion. However, the official kanji are different; \u95bb\u9b54\u5200 meaning \"Sword of the Enma\". Enma, or Yama, is the Judge of Death in Buddhist mythology, thus Vergil's signature move is named the \"Judgement Cut\".Trivia See also Lady  Lady is a human Devil Hunter who first appeared in Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening as both a supporting character and boss. She is the daughter of Arkham and sought to hunt him down, encountering Dante in the process. After the events of Devil May Cry 3, she joins Devil May Cry. She also appears as a playable character in Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition. While her preferred name, \"Lady\", was given to her by Dante, her birth name is Mary.Background  Lady shares her original name, Mary, with the Virgin Mary, who called on St. Lucia and Beatrice to aid the poet Dante Alighieri in his sojourn through Hell. As such, her chosen name of \"Lady\" is likely then a reference to one of the Virgin's other names, \"Madonna\" (Italian for \"Lady\").Appearance  Lady has dark, chin-length hair on both sides of her face and she has a fringe that reaches her eyebrows. She has many scars across her body, the most prominent being the one across her nose. She also always has a necklace with a red gem on it. Like her father, she has the genetic condition called heterochromia, which render each of her eyes a different color: her left eye is red while her right eye is bluish-green. Lady seems to be younger than Dante. When she is first seen in Devil May Cry 3, she wears a schoolgirl outfit with a short white blouse that bares her midriff and sleeves that reach just past her elbows. The skirt appears to be made of protective plating and she has a utility belt to hold gun magazines, with dark shorts underneath. Connected to the belt is a harness for Kalina Ann. She carries a pistol on the front of her skirt and a sub-machine gun on the back, with a lever action bow gun of sorts strapped to her left thigh, and finally, a pistol strapped to her right boot. She wears dark brown gloves and orange-brown knee-high boots, with black socks under. For her short appearance in the manga, she wore a standard schoolgirl outfit. She had a white blouse with a tie and a skirt with black thigh high socks and shoes. This is the only time where she doesn't have her necklace. During the anime, Lady wears her Devil May Cry 3 outfit but occasionally changes it. She also wore a red, full-body biker suit. She wore a green jacket and jean short shorts at one point. Very shortly she wore a purple jacket with white frills and purple pants. Her final outfit was a disguise as a blackjack dealer, wearing a vest, white button-up shirt and a miniskirt. During the events in Devil May Cry 4, Lady has noticeably matured, growing a larger chest. Her hair is longer, but keeps the same general style, with the hair framing her face reaching her collarbone. Her outfit consists of a white jacket with what appears to be a harness underneath with no shirt revealing her ample cleavage and belly button. She also has white short shorts and red gloves. She has magazine pouches on either side of her hips and knee-high boots. She also wears sunglasses.Personality  Lady is very fierce, rough, and tough enough to keep up with Dante. She is described as a \"psychotic devil-hunting female\". Although, when she kills her father, Lady breaks down and cries, showing a more sentimental side. She also appears to have a bit of a crush on Dante, as she appears to show a softer side when around him and she gets a little jealous when she learns that Dante is good friends with Trish. She originally hated all demons, even half-demons, and wanted to exterminate all of them. Her greatest weapon at the time was her belief that what she was doing was right. This caused her to develop a moral bigotry against demons, believing them to be remorseless monsters unable to understand things like love or family. This may have been the reason why she did not initially believe in the legend of Sparda, she may not have been able to accept the fact that a demon is responsible for both the world's and humanity's continued existence. However, over time and through her experiences with Dante, she learns that Sparda did exist and that humans and demons are equals in their capacity for both righteousness and depravity.Gameplay  In Devil May Cry 3, Lady will wear her alternate \"Ridersuit\" costume if Dante or Vergil are wearing their \"Legendary Dark Knight\" or \"Corrupt Vergil\" costumes. In Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition, Lady is a playable character as the \"Nero\" half of the Lady/Trish playthrough. Her combat style relies heavily on using her firearms. She has access to her dual handguns, shotgun and Kalina Ann. Kalina Ann also doubles as her sole melee weapon, attacking with slow, wide swings, smashing enemies with the weight and bayonet of her weapon. Though her attack speed is the slowest of the playable characters and lacking any real combos, her melee power is impressive and the missiles from her bazooka deal impressive damage, even on bosses. Instead of a Devil Trigger, Lady's \"magic\" is represented by grenade icons. When she has three or more in stock, she can perform a screen-filling explosion from a multitude of grenades. She can also perform a double jump by firing Kalina Ann at the ground, the force of the shot and explosion propelling her upward. As she plays through Nero's stages, her Wire Shot replaces Nero's Devil Bringer functionality, allowing her to latch onto glowing skulls.Biography Past  As a baby, Lady was named \"Mary\" by her father, Arkham, who inherited the blood of the legendary priestess whom Sparda had slain to seal the Temen-ni-gru. However, at some point her father became obsessed with the legend and the possibility of obtaining Sparda's power, and slew Kalina Ann, his wife and Lady's mother. At this time, Lady disowned him and renounced her name before committing to the path of a Devil Hunter.Devil May Cry 3  In a quest for revenge, she begins to climb the Temen-ni-gru in pursuit of Arkham. She first meets Dante just after his battle with Cerberus. She fires a missile from Kalina Ann at Dante, who dodges the missile and rides it around the chamber like a flying surfboard. After the missile blows a hole in the wall, Lady uses the new entrance to continue up the tower. She fights her way up through the tower, taking a different path than Dante. As she approaches the top, she is confronted by Arkham, who calmly asks her why she points a gun at her own kin. She then claims the only family she had was her mother and attempts to shoot him, but Arkham dodges her bullets and flips her off the side of the tower. She fires at him with her handguns as she falls, and one bullet grazes his cheek. Below, Dante, in devilishly proper timing, catches her by the ankle. She demands that Dante let her go, but Dante jokes that it would be waste if she were to end up as \"just a pretty stain\". She then shoots Dante in the forehead, and he drops her. By jamming the blade of the Kalina Ann into the wall of the tower, she manages to stop her fall only a short distance away. Dante peers over the ledge to express his outrage at being shot, so she shoots at him again. This time Dante catches the bullet in his teeth but leaves her be. Still, without a name, she presses on. She does not see Dante again until Leviathan nearly falls on her. Not sure what to make of it, she draws her gun as the eye begins to move. In a fountain of blood, Dante bursts forth from the eye. He starts to walk away, following a sign left by Jester, but she stops him. The two exchange a few words but are attacked by demons. She and Dante stand back-to-back and fight off the demons. During the battle, Dante asks what her name is, to which Lady responds that she doesn't have one and that he can call her whatever he likes. Dante, in a rather dismissive way, replies \"Whatever, Lady\" before leaping away and leaving the rest of the demons for her to deal with. When Dante finds the seemingly dead body of Arkham, Lady arrives at the scene. Seeing the body of her despised father, she asks Dante if he is responsible. When Dante replies with an unsatisfactory, \"So what if I did?\" Lady flies into a rage and shoots at Dante, though he dodges or counters every shot. While venting her anger on Dante, she explains Arkham's sins and that he is her father. She laments about Arkham's death being her responsibility since they are family but ultimately sends Dante on his way. Sometime after Dante's departure, Arkham awakes, though he is still on the verge of death. He tells Lady that it was a demon who tricked him into killing his wife, and pins the blame on Vergil. After saying this, he takes his last breath. Lady then cries over him and promises to avenge his death by stopping Vergil. Lady then catches up to Dante as he is fighting Vergil, and joins the clash. Soon after, Jester stops the battle. Jester reveals that he is, in fact, the alter ego of Arkham. Arkham also reveals that he lured Dante, Vergil, and Lady into that chamber, stating that all of them are the key in his plan to unlock the path to Demon World. In Lady's case, she is the descendant of a human priestess who Sparda sacrificed to seal the Temen-ni-gru. Jester mocks the brothers, saying they are weak. After slamming Lady's face into the floor, he stabs her thigh with the Kalina Ann in order to draw her blood and break the seal. Lady, Vergil, and Dante together try to put an end to Arkham, but, since they are weakened from having fought each other, he easily dispatches them and knocks them off of the rising platform on which they were standing. Lady nearly falls again as the floor beneath her and the sons of Sparda collapses, but Dante catches her. She insists that it is her job to stop Arkham since he is her father, Claiming \"a Demon like you wouldn't understand\" and uses the grappling hook on the Kalina Ann to ascend to the top of the tower. Dante, however, doesn't think she is a match for Arkham and follows her by a different route. Dante finally catches up with her at the Divine Library. When Dante goes to the top of the tower to teleport to the Demon World, Lady stops him and aims her gun at Dante, saying that it is her responsibility to stop Arkham and Dante should not interfere. Dante insists that it is his responsibility, too, and demands that Lady get out of the way. Lady refuses and they begin a fight. After her defeat, Dante remarks that this whole mess started with his father, and he should sort it out. Lady acquiesces and entrusts Dante now understanding what Dante's really fighting for she gives him Kalina Ann in exchange for his name. Sometime later, Lady is shown catching a glimpse of Vergil going to the top of the tower. After Arkham's acquisition of Sparda's power and subsequent defeat at the hands of Dante and Vergil, Arkham falls back to the human world. As Arkham, weakened and bloodied, tries to recover, Lady finds him. With Lady training her gun at him, Arkham pleads his innocence and begs her for his life. Lady shoots him regardless, several times. Lady then cries beside his body. Lady reappears at the end of the game beside Dante, and converses about the aftermath. This is where she coins the famous phrase 'Devil May Cry' after seeing Dante shedding tears for his brother. Afterward, the demons still left in the human world appear and attack both of them. Lady fights beside Dante. Then, the scene shifts to Lady's commentary about the future, the demons left in the human world, and about Dante's newly opened shop. Through her interactions with Dante, Lady realizes that demons are capable of both good and evil, just as humans are.Devil May Cry: The Animated Series  In the anime, she works as a solo devil hunter but sometimes calls on Dante for jobs, and sometimes for the money that he owes her. She also was unaware of Dante's other partner, Trish (from the first Devil May Cry), until they intersect at one of the jobs of hers. Lady is hired by a priest who claimed the blond woman was controlling the demons terrorizing the town he was in. After realizing that she was tricked and dealing with the demonic priest, Lady and Trish grow to like each other. Unfortunately for Dante, this means buying expensive clothes and leaving him with the bill. During the Abigail incident, Lady and Trish kill a large amount of lesser demons while Dante kills Sid. Also during the episode where she first meets Trish, Trish asks if Lady likes Dante, Lady quickly says no and goes on to point out Dante's flaws. During the series, Lady would often jokingly call Dante a \"dumbass\" and when Dante won a card game against her, she would automatically assume Dante cheated, which he really did. During mission 09 Lady helped Dante win a card game to lure out a demon. After Dante won, he, under control of magic, offered to play a \"game\" with her and had a shootout with him, which Lady shot Dante with Ebony, but Dante later recovered, and mocked her aim saying she had barely missed his heart. Throughout the series, she would visit Devil May Cry to pick up money he owed her, or to hang out with Dante and Patty.Devil May Cry 4  Lady is the one responsible for getting Dante and Trish involved in the events in Fortuna by assigning them there. She is the one who tells Dante and Trish about the Order of the Sword, a small congregation that gathers in the city of Fortuna. She also says that lately they started collecting Devil Arms and \"even have butted in on some of her jobs\". She also hints that the Order may have something more to them than what meets the eye. After Trish takes Sparda and leaves, Lady follows shortly. Though she is present during Fortuna incident, Lady\u2019s whereabouts remained unknown and likely helps Trish evacuating the civilians out of Fortuna. After Sanctus and the Savior are defeated, Trish, Lady, and Dante watch Nero and Kyrie have a romantic moment from afar. As Trish and Dante start leaving, Lady remarks that they are about to miss the best part when Dante questions her about his pay for the job, to which Lady reassures him he will get his money. Later on, Lady comes back to Dante's shop to pay for their services, giving them a small money roll. Trish complains about this small payment to which Lady reasons that the events that happened there escalated because of Trish's actions. Dante accepts the pay for what it is when they receive a call from a customer with a password. Lady tags along despite Dante telling her she wouldn't be getting payed, telling her how exciting it is to go on a mission together.Powers & Abilities Powers  While still a normal human, she is also an exceptionally skilled firearms expert and extremely acrobatic in close quarters combat.. Lady is a remarkably talented Devil Hunter, able to easily kill most demons with her weapons. In the animated series, Lady was shown to have some skill in hand-to-hand combat able to disarm Trish and go toe-to-toe with her in a physical fight for a short time despite her superior physical abilities as a demon. During episode 9 of anime series, she can outshoot Dante and avoid his heart perfectly, destroying the magical watch Dante keeps in his pocket in the process when he is under its influence that prompts user to enter \"Showdown\" mode -- either shoot the opponent or be shot in a poker match. Physical conditioning: Lady is capable performing physical feats above any other human in the series.Abilities  Sharpshooter: Lady can use a variety of firearms and long range weapons with incredible accuracy and versatility.

She is a capable player, able to strategically make a complicated strike to win a bet. Hand-to-Hand Combat: Lady was capable of disarming Trish and holding her own against her in hand-to-hand combat, despite being physically weaker. Acrobatics: Lady is able to swing from and perform multiple flips across uneven bars and balance herself on one hand while carrying Kalina Ann. She was able to catch herself between two bars with just her legs. While carrying Kalina Ann, she is able to balance herself on her motorcycle while shooting both of her pistols, jump off of it while it remains on its course, and land back on top of it while moving at high speeds.Arsenal  Kalina Ann: Lady's signature weapon, named after her mother, it is customized missile launcher similar to a MANPADS, with a blade on top of it. Lady uses it as\u00a0firearm at long distances as well as\u00a0melee weapon in close combat. Handguns: A pair of handguns that resemble CZ-75, modified with match grade target sights, an extended barrel, and a compensator/barrel weight.

If the user selects the \"delete\" option, Lady will cry.Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3  Lady appears in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 as an ability card for the mode Heroes and Heralds.Project X Zone  Lady is a playable characters in the Capcom, Sega, and Namco Bandai crossover Project X Zone. This is the first time that Lady is a playable character.Monster Hunter Frontier G  Lady appears in a crossover trailer for Monster Hunter Frontier G, and her clothing is available to player characters as armor.Playstation All-Stars Battle Royale  Lady appears as an unlockable icon in Playstation All-Stars Battle Royale. To unlock players must reach Rank 15 with Dante.Trivia Rebellion  Rebellion is Dante's trademark sword appearing throughout the series. Though it has the form of a standard claymore, it is a magical blade given to him as a keepsake from his father, Sparda, and it serves as a physical manifestation of his power. The blade's power originally laid dormant, but through contact with Dante's blood, it was awakened. Its name, means \"resistance.\"Appearance  Rebellion is a massive claymore with a heavy double-edged blade, notched on both sides near the tip. In its dormant form, the pommel is a single spike, but after awakening it splits open into several. The grip is plain, but the guard is skeletal, with a skull-design on each side leading to the rib cage from which the blade emerges; on one side of the blade, the skull is that of a human, while the other uses a horned demon's skull. Initially, the crossguard is folded in against the ribs, but it extends and the skull transform to a screaming skull once the sword is awakened by Dante's blood.Powers  The Rebellion is a remarkably powerful magical sword. It is sharp enough to impale the surface of the Savior's body while it is powered by the sword of Sparda. It is also one of the most durable objects in the series, capable of withstanding hits from the space-cutting blade Yamato, as well as a direct punch from the Savior. Rebellion is awakened by Dante's blood, however, Dante's own latent power must be active for the blood to have an effect. In the manga, Dante's latent demonic powers became temporarily active and his blood transformed Rebellion, but when Dante's powers became dormant again, Rebellion became dormant as well.History  Rebellion once belonged to Dante's father, Sparda, and was given to Dante as a keepsake according to the description from Devil May Cry 2 and Devil May Cry 3. He uses it as his primary weapon while exploring the Temen-ni-gru, but after his first battle with his brother Vergil, Dante is impaled with the blade, with his blood inadvertently awakening the blade along with his demonic powers, and granting him access to Devil Trigger. Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening Dante continues to use the sword until he recovers his father's personal blade, the Force Edge. He goes back to using the Rebellion after giving the Force Edge to Trish. However it's not seen in the first. Devil May Cry When on a mission, Dante just carries the sword on his back, but while among humans, he carries it in a guitar case to avoid unwanted attention. Devil May Cry: The Animated SeriesGameplay  In Devil May Cry 2, Rebellion is the default sword in Dante's arsenal and it functions like the other melee weapons in terms of physical potential, excluding the Sparda (Devil Arm) which is no longer used by him. Also, Dante has his Devil Trigger and thus, attack power is amplified but not as much. However only in the demonic form can the player utilize the abilities of the Amulet's and when airborne, Dante can throw his sword like a boomerang at enemies. In Devil May Cry 3, the Rebellion has been evolved to allow additional abilities, he has access to his full Combo moves which include various slashes. He can apply some of his power to \"Drive\", which he spends time channeling red energy into the sword to throw out a tremor-like shockwave that will go after all enemies and may trip them. In his new Swordmaster Style, Dante can has more attack styles, he can execute Aerial Rave which is where Dante jumps and attacks with his swords many times until he drops, he can utilize Sword Pierce to throw Rebellion at an enemy or wall, until the player chooses to call back the sword that performs a manner similar to the Round Trip (which has demonstrated hits when demons aren't aware of the sword lodged in the wall behind them) and Dante can use the time to attack with his bare hands & feet or with other enemies until then. Dante can also execute Prop Shredder to swirl his sword like a buzzsaw that can throw up enemies and cut them in the center. Lastly, Dante can perform \"Dance Macabre\", where he performs all his combo moves and million stab until he then spins rapidly on his sword like a dancing pole before finishing off the attack with a large sweep. In the Devil Trigger form, Dante performs faster moves and cannot be interrupted unless it's a large foe. He can however, utilize his folded coat wings to naturally glide and when he utilizes Air Hike near a wall to leap off of, he can descend faster and go longer in distance. In Devil May Cry 4, the Rebellion has been given longer durations of the \"combo\" moves and from skill, Dante had faster speeds and could thus execute his \"Drives\" with a \"Quick\" manner, these moves now utilize pure energy merged with the slash and extended with the \"Overdrive\". Dante has the ability to increase the length of his attacks and power with his Devil Trigger, which gives additional power to his moves, such as Stinger. His Round Trip returned, but could be used much easier like the sword that replaced Rebellion; Sparda and he could command it just like the previous Sword Pierce. In \"Dance Macabre\", Dante would do the same attacks to start it off, but now the difference is that instead of swinging on his sword like a dancing pole, Dante kicks up his foes into the air and swing them away with an energy-empowered baseball bat swing.Trivia Other Media Appearances Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne  Dante wields Rebellion. One of his special moves is also named \"Rebellion\", which deals a moderate amount of Almighty damage to a single target and cannot be dodged; the animation for this move is a five-hit combo using Rebellion.Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds  Dante wields his Rebellion and can perform many of his signature techniques, including High Time, Helm Breaker, Prop Shredder, Stinger, Million Stab, Aerial Rave, Drive, Air Hike, Dance Macabre and Crazy Dance. Dante can also perform a new Level 3 Hyper Combo, \"Devil Must Die\", in which he zips back and forth with Stingers and stabs the opponent with a final Stinger that propels the enemy backward into a magical trap of some sort that resembles those set by Trish.Monster Hunter Frontier G  Rebellion appears as an available weapon in Monster Hunter Frontier G.Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite  In this game, Rebellion functions the same as it did before, but now its power has access to a feature similar to the Super costume when in battle with Jedah. Because Rebellion was a cameo like its previous appearances, there are no new gameplay features due to it working the same.References Mundus  Mundus, known as the Prince of Darkness, is a devil prince who ruled the Demon World two thousands years ago, overthrowing the previous ruler of the Demon World and threatening the human world. Challenged by the dark knight, Sparda, he was defeated and soon sealed in a vault on Mallet Island. He appears as the final boss and main antagonist of Devil May Cry.Appearance  Mundus's appearance when he battles Dante is that of a gigantic living statue of an old, bearded angel with a circular depression in his chest, where an eye-like core is located in his true form. During his final battle with Dante, the statue breaks away, revealing a grotesque, writhing mass of living tissue, with three eyeballs and hundreds of hands coming out of it. Additionally, Mundus often appears as three glowing orbs (eyes) arcing with energy. He is seen this way while communicating with Griffon, Trish, and before battling Vergil.Personality  Mundus is depicted as the epitome of evil within the Devil May Cry universe. He has no loyalty or compassion for his minions, gleefully and sadistically killing one of his own generals, Griffon, after he failed to defeat Dante and pleaded for his master's aid, or even using Trish as a bargaining chip over Dante to ensure an easy victory, which could be seen as cowardly. Like most other demons in the series, Mundus has a low opinion on humans, even going so far as to wonder if Dante's human heritage had weakened his father's blood. Though he hates Sparda, he did note he could see the same 'light' from Sparda's eyes in Dante's, which could indicate a measure of respect he once held for his greatest general, though this could also simply be a fallback reference as to how both Phantom and Griffon saw Sparda within Dante. Mundus is also very driven by his goals, setting servant after servant to destroy Dante before finally taking the fight to the devil hunter himself. And even after losing again, he still forced a smaller Hellgate open in a bid for vengeance on Dante.Story Before Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening  Two millennia ago, the Devil Prince Mundus was born into the depths of the Demon World as it snowed in the Human World, and quickly rose to power. After building a great army he slew the previous Demon King and took the title for himself. He planned to lead an assault on the Human World, as he wished to conquer it and rule both the lower and upper realms, but Sparda, a powerful demon knight, awoke to justice, leading him to single-handedly defeat both Mundus and his armies, and seal the main gate within the Underworld. In response, Mundus planned revenge against Sparda's family. His demons attacked and killed Eva, Sparda's wife and Dante and Vergil's mother.Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening  At the end of Devil May Cry 3 in the secret ending, as Sparda's son Vergil found himself trapped in the Demon World, he comes upon Mundus, who glares down on him silently with his triple eyed avatar. Vergil challenges him in battle, though this battle is never seen. In his weakened state, he is defeated, and transformed into Nelo Angelo, leading into the events of Devil May Cry.Devil May Cry  In Devil May Cry, Mundus attempts to escape into the Human World by opening a gate on Mallet Island. At the same time, he uses Trish to manipulate Sparda's other son, Dante, into coming to the island so that he can be killed. For much of the game, Mundus remains dormant within the statue of his younger form in the main hall of the castle, with Dante writing the statue off as nothing more than a depiction of the inhabitants god. He first appears after the third battle with Griffon, ruthlessly executing his fallen general after he pleads to Mundus to be healed and strengthened to defeat Dante. Mundus is not seen again until Nelo Angelo's ultimate defeat, commenting to Trish that Vergil had fallen and saying she knew what she had to do. While Trish does ultimately lure Dante into a trap to battle Nightmare, this fails and Mundus appears, threatening Trish with the consequences of her failure. When Dante finally arrives in Mundus' lair, a chapel like area, and sees the Devil Emperor sitting on his throne, musing on the irony of again facing a Sparda, with Dante retorting the irony of Mundus' defeat at his hands. Mundus however has one last card to play: The captured Trish. Playing on Dante's feelings for Trish, Mundus ruthlessly impales Dante with three beams of red energy, taunting Dante's weakness. Mundus prepares to deal the final blow when Trish intervenes, seemingly sacrificing herself for Dante. Annoyed with his creation's 'behavior' Mundus again attempts to destroy Dante, but the young devil hunter deflects the blast and demands Mundus show himself. Deciding to honor Dante's words, Mundus sheds his marble like form, revealing his aged, angelic body and then transports himself and Dante to his pocket dimension. There, he comments on how he now sees the light of Sparda's eyes within Dante's own. When Dante demands to know why Mundus used his mother's face, Mundus calls her a 'worthless being' and suggests to Dante he could make as many as he wanted. Dante demands silence and this sparks the final battle between the two, with Mundus flying off into the darkness and Dante assuming his father's form via Devil Trigger. Dante succeeds in injuring Mundus but himself is knocked down into the pit of lava below, Mundus following. Mundus attempts to overwhelm Dante with his raw power but Dante overcomes him after a lengthy battle, and Mundus painfully takes to the skies, screaming as his wings fall away and his pocket dimension fades away, seemingly taking Mundus with it. However, the prince of darkness returns as Mallet Island begins to collapse, literally tearing open a much smaller Hell Gate in the sewers, directly in front of Dante. The grievously wounded Mundus vowed Dante would not leave, and Dante decided to stand his ground, swearing the island would become Mundus own burial ground. Though his powers had been greatly weakened, and Dante was able to chip away at his body, exposing his hideous true form, Mundus only mocked Dante's efforts, calling his powers weak in the Human World. But just then, Trish returned and gave Dante her powers, supercharging the devil hunter who blasted Mundus with his overpowered handguns, sending the Prince of Darkness screaming back into the Underworld. As he was forced to return to the demon world, Mundus vowed to Dante he would return and rule the Human World.Devil May Cry 2  In the opening cutscene of Devil May Cry 2, a nearly exact copy of the statue of Mundus (his younger, angelic form) is briefly shown as the narration recounts a portion of the tale of Sparda.Powers and Abilities  Hailed as the Prince of Darkness and Devil Emperor, Mundus has the power to back up these titles. He was known for having posed a difficult challenge to the god-like legendary Dark Knight Sparda and was powerful enough to surpass the earlier level of might wielded by the Sons of Sparda, as shown by his easy victory over Vergil and even Dante and he could challenge Dante when Dante used the power of the Force Edge. As the ruler of the Demon World, Mundus has absolute control over almost all lesser demons within his domain.Powers  Supernatural strength: As a god-like demon, Mundus possesses high amount of strength. He is able to easily punch through stone. Supernatural durability: Mundus is also incredibly resilient, surviving his first battle with Sparda and capable of taking direct hits from Dante wielding Sparda's true power for an extended period of time. Even while his statu-esque shell has begun falling apart, he was generally unharmed by Dante without the power of Sparda. Demonic energy manipulation: Mundus is capable of projecting extremely powerful demonic energy. He can fire red energy needles from his eyes, hands, or back that are strong enough to cause Dante pain. By charging large amount of energy into his third eye, Mundus can fire a powerful beam of white energy. Flight: By virtue of his wings, Mundus is capable of taking flight.Abilities  Universe creation: Mundus is powerful enough to create a universe filled with stars and at least one planetoid. Demon creation: Mundus is capable of creating powerful demons, as he was the one who created Trish, Nightmare, Leviathan, Blades, Assaults and Frosts. Mind manipulation: Mundus is capable of suppressing a ones memories and altering ones personalities to make them serve him. Power augmentation: Mundus can enhance the powers and abilities of chosen individuals. Orb summoning: Mundus can summon orbs for various purposes. He has dark grey ones that generate a force field to protect him from attacks or that he can fire at an enemy. He has smaller white ones that can fire white energy needles.Other Appearances Viewtiful Joe  In Viewtiful Joe, Mundus convinces Captain Blue to get revenge on Dante and Trish, but the plan ultimately fails due to Eva. He makes a return appearance in Red Hot Rumble alongside Sparda and Vergil.Devil May Cry: War of the Peak  Mundus appears in the trailer and is showcased to be fighting against Devil May Cry 3 versions of: Dante, Vergil and Lady.Background  The Mundus Cereris was a pit in Roman mythology which contained an entrance to Hades, the underworld, which was ruled by Pluto, the Roman god of the underworld; Mundus is identified as Pluto twice within Devil May Cry. The stone covering the pit, known as the lapis manalis, would be removed three times a year, and when it was removed it was believed that the spirits of the blessed dead would commune with the living. Mundus's three eyes are likely a reference to Satan, who is portrayed with three faces in Dante Alighieri's The Divine Comedy. Satan is also considered the \"Prince of This World\" and the \"Prince of Darkness\", both of which are titles that Mundus shares with him. Mundus's pseudo-angelic appearance also coincides with Satan's traditional role as a fallen angel within the Christian faith. Though Mundus's appearance and basis is rightfully in the fashion of that of Judeo-Christian design, the absence of any God sort of figure mentioned throughout the series appears to draw basis from the Demon King Mara and the fiend's depiction from Japanese Buddhism; known as Dairokutenmaou, or The Great Sixth Heaven's Demon King, Mara keeps his figure as a being who dwells in the furthest reaches of the Sixth Heaven of the Desire Realm, responsible for the creation of the world to keep all in its carnal grasp, and is the leader of demons who follow him under his command. Like Mara, Mundus bears this in his aspects, from his heavenly facade to being the literal king of the Demon World.Trivia Beowulf (Devil Arm)  Beowulf is a set of flash gauntlets and greaves Devil Arm appearing in Devil May Cry 3 which originates from Beowulf. It is wielded by both Vergil and Dante during the course of the game. Dante can acquire the weapon in Mission 14, while Vergil starts the game with this Devil Arm in his scenario of Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition and in Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition.Appearance and Description  Beowulf is a set of black gauntlets and greaves with a somewhat animalistic look. The gauntlets vaguely resemble a wolfs head, with fangs and mane. The grieves look like clawed legs. They also have glowing veins that have white light flowing through them. As they are \"blessed with the sacred light,\" all of Beowulf emits light with each punch and kick. They are capable of concentrating light into a ball and throwing it or erupting it from the users body. It can also cover the user in light.Gameplay Devil May Cry 3 Dante  Beowulf focuses on close range but powerful hits. Beowulf generally has a narrow area of effect making it a less than ideal for crowd control.It boosts the wielder's attack and speed for close combat, and is able to charge its attacks for harder hits, and in the case of Rising Dragon, more hits. When Beowulf's attack becomes fully charged, the attacking body part will start to shake and Dante's voice will change in a rough outcry when the attack is performed. Killer Bee is a dive-kick that can adjust its angle of descent to adjust for enemy position. Swordmaster technique Volcano will knock back all enemies around Dante. Real Impact, the strongest move of all the Devil Arms, will pull any enemies in Dante's immediate vicinity into the air with him, but has a long start-up and cannot be canceled out of, leaving Dante vulnerable.Vergil  In the Special Edition, Vergil has access to Beowulf and it generally has the same properties it has when used by Dante but lacks the charge mechanic. His attacks hit harder than Dante's, removing the need for charging. Starfall is Vergil's dive-kick, and it works the same as Dante's except it does more damage. Lunar Phase is a multi-hit spin kick that can be Jump Canceled. Rising Sun is Vergil's launcher where he performs two upward roundhouse kicks. This technique cannot be canceled and aerial attacks can't be used until the attack is finished.Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition  Beowulf in general is Vergil's most powerful weapon. It easily can be considered \"overpowered\". Vergil is able to charge all of its attacks up to two shines, three with full Concentration. The third charge automatically launches the attack. Just Frame release can enhance every charge for higher damage, and can be combined with Distortion for devastating amounts of damage, In Devil Trigger, Vergil is able to spend some of his Devil Trigger gauge to power up his moves, much like Dante. Such being Lunar Phase (ground), ending with Rising Star move and Lunar Phase (mid-air) making additional spins. There is also an \"infinite spin abuse\" trick, which can render any enemy stun-locked, even Dante, who is able to quickly evade attacks. The formula of it is simple: {Teleport to an enemy + use Lunar Phase + teleport to an enemy again before attack finishes (this allows you to cancel it) + use Lunar Phase again....}\u00a0and then repeat.Other Appearances Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds  Dante uses the Beowulf in Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds. The skills packed with it are Killer Bee, The Hammer, and Volcano, along with a new ability called Beehive (which is actually a named version of his Beowulf Combo II from the original DMC3), where Dante kicks rapidly with his greaves then heel smashes the ground and thus acts as a followup to Volcano.Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3  The updated re-release of Marvel vs. Capcom 3 features the addition of Vergil to the roster of playable characters. He comes equipped with Beowulf, like Dante, and can use several of its attacks: Starfall, Lunar Phase, and Rising Sun.Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite  Dante retains the use of Beowulf in Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite with many of the same moves as before, though the gauntlets now exude a purple glow when used.Trivia Devil May Cry 4  Devil May Cry 4 is the fourth installment of Devil May Cry game series. In Devil May Cry 4, the player controls both Nero, a new character, and Dante, the series's main protagonist, while they fight demons using firearms and melee weapons in a hack and slash, shoot 'em up setting. Other characters include new appearances by Kyrie, Sanctus, Credo, Gloria, and Agnus, and returning characters Lady and Trish. On December 15, 2014, a remastered version of the game, Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition was announced by Capcom along with the remastered version of DmC: Devil May Cry, DmC: Devil May Cry - Definitive Edition. The Special Edition is a physical and\u00a0digital release in Japan and Asian regions and a digital release only for Xbox One (via Xbox Store), PlayStation 4 (via PSN), and PC (via Steam) in the remaining regions. Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition has additional modes, new and improved gameplay features and mechanics, it runs at 1080p/60FPS plus a new Japanese voice track and new playable characters compared to the original version of the game.Development  Devil May Cry 4 is the second sequel (Devil May Cry 3 being the prequel) to the Capcom action game Devil May Cry. It was announced in March 2007 that the game would be released simultaneously for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and later for the PC. It was developed by Capcom Production Studio 4, the producers of Resident Evil 4 and the original Devil May Cry, though by this time Hiroyuki Kobayashi became the producer but Hideki Kamiya didn't resume his role as the director as he was no longer with the team.Gameplay  The gameplay for Devil May Cry 4 follows closely to its predecessors, especially Devil May Cry 3, as a hack and slash adventure. Players navigate their way through massive levels while slaying demons mostly in a third person perspective. Emphasis is placed on the methods used to deal with enemies, in the form of a Stylish Rank Gauge. Players can rack up Style points by defeating enemies with both melee and projectile weapons. Varying one's attacks further increases the gauge, while using the same move repeatedly will lower and stop the letter ranking until another style is used. Players can also dodge and taunt to increase their stylish ranking. The game's duration is divided between two separate characters with their own storyline. The player starts off with the new character and main protagonist, Nero, who adds several new aspects to the gameplay. His motorcycle-inspired sword called Red Queen possesses the Exceed system, which allows it to be \"revved\" up like an engine to increase its power. His unique ability is the Devil Bringer, which allows him to grapple and inflict extra damage on enemies, including bosses. For a good deal of the game, Nero uses his Devil Trigger and the Yamato. Nero does not gain new weapons, but new powers for his Devil Bringer to enhance its use. More than halfway through the game, the player takes control of Dante. The gameplay for Dante is almost identical to his Devil May Cry 3 counterpart. He has access to his four starting styles: Swordmaster, the melee-oriented style; Gunslinger, which brings out the best in ranged weapons; Trickster, which relies on evasion; and Royalguard, the defense-oriented style. Unlike the third game, each one can be switched to at will with the press of a corresponding D-Pad button. Near the end of the game, Dante gains the Dark Slayer Style, which grants him direct use of the Yamato. Dante is more agile and stronger than Nero, starts out with a Devil Trigger, and can gain new weapons along the way. Another new addition to the game is the Proud Soul, which can be earned through achieving Style points during missions and are used to exchange for new abilities and attacks, as well as to upgrade styles . Proud Souls can also be regained by 'selling' abilities that have already been bought, giving the player much more freedom for what they choose to add or not to add to their arsenal.Plot  The game opens with Nero hurrying towards the Opera House where the Order of the Sword is conducting a ceremony, with his right arm in a sling. Meanwhile Kyrie, Nero\u2019s romantic interest, is beginning to open the ceremony with a song and is disappointed not to find Nero in the audience. She begins her song nonetheless as Nero encounters several Scarecrow demons on his way to the Opera House. He dispatches them and arrives at the Opera House just in time to hear the end of Kyrie\u2019s song. Following this, Kyrie joins Nero in the audience where she finds that Nero has left a present for her, a golden necklace. The High Priest of the Order of the Sword, Sanctus, beckons the Order members to join him in prayer; Nero is visibly bored by this and is about to leave despite Kyrie\u2019s protests, when his right arm begins to glow ominously. At this moment, Dante bursts through the ceiling and assassinates Sanctus. Nero, under the impression that Kyrie is in danger, attacks Dante to initiate a fight. As Dante gains the upper hand, Nero's right arm, the Devil Bringer, awakens and uses its power to seemingly kill Dante by impaling him with his own sword upon the statue of Sparda. Dante responds by saying that Nero is \"getting better\", and then pushes himself off the statue. As Dante removes the sword from his chest, Nero asks, \"You're not human, are you?\" Dante replies that \"We're the same, you and I ... and them,\" pointing to one of the dead knights. Nero looks and it is revealed that the knight was possessed with a demonic appearance. Nero looks up to see that Dante is already resting on the hole in the ceiling from which he came. Dante states that he suspects Nero \"carries something different from the others\", and then swoops out of view just as the knight reinforcements arrive. Nero is charged with capturing Dante and bringing him back to the Order to answer for his crimes by Credo, the leader of the Order's knights and Kyrie\u2019s brother. Upon leaving the Opera House, however, a demonic horde begins to lay waste to the city. Nero and Kyrie are separated as Nero begins to slay the demons. Whilst journeying to Fortuna Castle he meets Gloria, a new member to the Order. Nero fights his way into the depths of Fortuna Castle. On the way, it is revealed that Sanctus has been infused with the soul of a demon to be revived. Agnus, the stuttering scientist and mastermind of the Order's demonic power manipulation, is also introduced. Nero finally reaches Agnus's facility where he is ambushed by several white knights and is injured. Vergil's broken katana, Yamato, responds to Nero and mends itself before flying into his hand. Nero fends off Agnus' attacks with the aid of a spectral blue demon hovering behind him; after the battle, Nero collapses in exhaustion. Agnus flees back to Sanctus and informs him of Nero\u2019s new-found power. Credo vows to take care of Nero while Gloria takes over Nero\u2019s pursuit of Dante. Nero is confronted by Credo, who has also been infused with demonic power, giving him the characteristics of an Angel. He is defeated by Nero, however, Kyrie arrives in time to witness Nero with his demonic arm standing over her defeated brother. Agnus uses the confusion and distraction on Nero\u2019s part to kidnap Kyrie and flee. Credo postpones his feud with Nero until he can investigate the situation. Nero once more meets Dante, but his quest to capture him is long since forgotten; he wishes to simply pass Dante. However, Dante wants Yamato, the sword used by his twin-brother Vergil, returned to him. A fight ensues where Dante is victorious; however, he decides to let Nero keep Yamato after the latter has \u201ccooled down\u201d. Gloria appears before Dante as Nero leaves; however, it is revealed that Gloria is in fact Trish, Dante\u2019s partner in his demon hunting business \u201cDevil May Cry\u201d. Nero reaches Sanctus and the \u201cSavior\u201d, an enormous demon which the Order intends to bring to life using Nero and Yamato\u2019s power. Using Kyrie as a human shield, Sanctus is successful in detaining Nero. Sanctus reveals that the Savior requires the essence of Sparda to reach full power; he originally intended Dante to be used as the core, but accepts Nero as a suitable substitute, claiming that Nero is also a descendant of Sparda. Credo attempts to rescue the two, but is mortally wounded by Sanctus. Dante arrives and tells Nero to give him his sword back. Nero tells Dante to \"come and get it\". Nero is then absorbed into the Savior. Agnus uses Yamato to open the true Hellgate, releasing a multitude of demons onto the city. Sanctus arrives with the Savior and begins to exterminate the demons. Dante, upon hearing Credo\u2019s dying request to rescue Kyrie and Nero, fights his way back towards the city. On his way, he destroys the three smaller Hellgates used to release the demons. Dante arrives back at the Opera House and kills Agnus. He then retrieves Yamato and uses it to destroy the true Hellgate before confronting Sanctus and the Savior. After discovering that the Savior is invincible from the outside, Dante drives Yamato into the chest of the Savior, where it is retrieved by Nero. Nero defeats Sanctus inside the Savior and rescues Kyrie. Nero eventually uses his Devil Bringer to destroy the Savior and Sanctus. After entrusting Nero with Yamato, Dante departs. Nero and Kyrie's reunion is interrupted by another demon attack. In the secret ending, at the Devil May Cry shop, Trish and Lady bicker over the small reward Lady had offered, with Lady accusing Trish for having disguised herself as Gloria and delivering Sparda's sword to the Order. After Trish forcibly drags him into their argument, Dante ends it by saying that it's \"better than nothing.\" What's interesting is that the magazine Dante is shown reading is entitled \"Two Handguns\" and that two pages are entitled \"Devil May Cry 4\" and \"Ebony and Ivory\". Afterwards, Lady sets out to leave, but then the phone rings, with a customer having another job for Dante to do, and the trio moves out to help.Difficulty Modes  With each rise in difficulty, enemies and bosses generally get tougher and the player gets weaker. There are 6 modes for the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions of the game with an additional mode for the PC version.iPhone version  In February 2011, Capcom released a simplified version of the game, Devil May Cry 4 Refrain, to fit on the iPhone. Compared to its console counterparts, it lacks the superiority of graphics and uses simplified controls.Special Edition History  On December 15, 2014, Devil May Cry 4 Special Edition was announced right after the trailer of DmC: Devil May Cry - Definitive Edition, 10 years after the release of Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition. All bonus content introduced in the Special Edition is available straight from the start. This includes; characters, costumes, and various other features. Any content that needed to be unlocked in the original game still needs to be unlocked in the same fashion. On March 24, 2015, an official trailer was released on YouTube with further announcements from Hideaki Itsuno. On June 23, 2015, Devil May Cry 4 Special Edition was officially released through digital download only in North America.New Features Play Using the Original Game Settings  In the Special Edition, a combination of button prompts can be inputted in the title screen of the game to switch the game's settings into its original version, this can only be done when there is no saved data, players will need to delete their saved data if there is one present. The inputs on each platform are as followed: If done correctly, the logo of the game will then turn into a different color and the player will gain fewer Proud Souls and Red Orbs, this setting cannot be changed back unless the saved data is deleted. In the PS4 version only, whenever a screenshot is taken, the logo of the game always appears on the bottom right corner of the picture, if the original game setting is active, the color of the logo in the screenshot will also change to reflect which mode it is on.Trivia See also External links Ebony & Ivory  Ebony & Ivory are Dante's trademark pair of personally customized, semi-automatic pistols, designed to rapidly fire bullets instilled with his demonic power, and are one of the several fire arms to appear in every Devil May Cry game series. The right-handed white gun, Ivory, was custom built for rapid firing and fast draw times, while the left-handed black gun, Ebony, has been modified for long-distance targeting and comfort. In Devil May Cry 3, upgrading it raises its max firepower.Design  Ebony & Ivory are both M1911-style handguns chambered for the .45 ACP round, and boast a plethora of customized features: In addition, several customized features are inconsistent between the various games: The inward-facing side of each weapon's slide (Ebony's right and Ivory's left) is engraved with \"Ebony & Ivory\" in a cursive script along with the unique design of piano keys, further alluding to its name. The outward facing sides (Ebony's left and Ivory's right) are engraved with a dedication to Dante which is explained in Devil May Cry Volume 1 to be from Nell Goldstein: Oddly enough, this engraving also appears on the Luce & Ombra, a similar set of pistols belonging to Dante's father and used by Trish which the Ebony & Ivory are modeled after. Hideaki Itsuno has mentioned on twitter that\u00a0engravings on Ebony & Ivory were wrong and\u00a0in Devil May Cry 5 it\u00a0has been corrected\u00a0to: The model used for the Ivory within Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening gameplay is simply a recolored copy of that used for the Ebony. The spent shells still behave as though the ejection port is pointed outward, appearing out of thin air above the gun and falling to Dante's right side. Dante tends to cross the guns when firing them.Gameplay  In most entries, Ebony and Ivory have the lowest damage output but provides the highest fire rate and mobility out of any fire arm, except the submachine guns. They primarily serve to juggle enemies and extend combos if an enemy is out of melee range. Ebony and Ivory temporarily slow Dante's descent, and when used in tandem with their juggling abilities, can allow the player to reposition themselves.Devil May Cry  In Devil May Cry, Dante can charge the bullets at the cost of Devil Trigger. Using Charge Shots will somewhat lower the speed and accuracy.Devil May Cry 2  In Devil May Cry 2, Ebony and Ivory can no longer be charged. This marks the first appearance of Twosome Time, while using another firearm, Dante will shoot Ivory in another direction if an enemy is nearby. By shooting right after pressing the jump button, Dante will flip upside down and fire on enemies below.Devil May Cry 3  In Devil May Cry 3, Ebony and Ivory are only capable of shooting on their own, however they are the only weapons that can be used during Free Ride. Using Gunslinger unleashes their full potential, allowing Dante to shoot faster and giving him access to Charge Shots, this time expending no Devil Trigger and not effecting accuracy or bullet speed. The pistols can be used to fire in two different directions, allowing the player limited control of enemy positions. (For an exploit, one can mash  and  alternatively, cancelling both Rapid Shot and Twosome Time at rapid succession, enabling an extremely high rate of fire). While in the air, Gunslinger grants access to Rainstorm, to rapidly fire on the enemies below. Mashing the  will cause Dante to continue Rainstorm until he reaches the ground. When standing over a downed enemy, firing repeatedly will make Dante hold the enemy down with his foot while firing Ebony and Ivory in a coup-de-grace fashion, before kicking the enemy away.Devil May Cry 4  Ebony and Ivory function largely the same as they did in Devil May Cry 3. Rainstorm is slightly easier to execute, needing only to hold the Style button to extend the technique. Charge Shots can be used regardless of what Style is active, and will be fired automatically while in Devil Trigger. Twosome Time can be now cancelled into Honeycomb Fire: disposing the multi-directional attacks in favor of the increased rate of fire.Other appearances Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne  Dante uses Ebony & Ivory for three special attacks. The first \"E & I\" deals up to four light physical hits on a single target. The second \"Bullet-Time\" deals moderate physical damage to all enemies and cannot be dodged. The last \"Showtime\" deals a large amount of Almighty damage to all enemies.Viewtiful Joe  Dante uses Ebony & Ivory for his long-ranged attacks.Sengoku Basara  Nouhime/Lady Butterfly's sixth weapon is Ebony & Ivory.Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds  Dante can use Ebony & Ivory as his crouching light attack (depending on the side he is facing), and can also perform Charged Shots/Twosome Time, Wild Stomp, also called Cold Shower, and Rain Storm, as well as fire them during his ground throws. His new Weasel Shot special, in which Dante leaps backward while firing, and his Million Dollars Hyper Combo, in which Dante fires a volley of bullets, then fires two charged shots in the style he used to finish off Mundus in DMC while saying \"Jackpot\", are newly introduced moves outside the original series.Background  The Ebony and Ivory references the black and white construction of piano keys.Trivia Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening  Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening is the third game in the Devil May Cry series. It is a prequel to the first Devil May Cry game, making it the first game in the series chronologically. Dante's twin brother, Vergil, and a man named Arkham release the ancient tower of Temen-ni-gru from below a modern city and conspire to use Dante to unlock the gate to the demonic realm. While working toward confronting his brother, Dante encounters Lady, a fellow devil hunter, and the mysterious Jester, an enigmatic clown that aids Dante\u00a0throughout his\u00a0journey.Gameplay  Devil May Cry 3 plays very differently from its predecessors although the premise still remains the same: slaying demons while solving puzzles to progress through the levels. Unlike the first and second game, Devil May Cry 3 puts much more emphasis on style rather than simple demon slaying. As such, combat is much more intense and faster than before. Players can now switch between both Devil Arms and firearms with the R2 and L2 buttons, allowing for a very powerful and stylish string of combos. The Stylish Rank is now represented by a gauge. As players land successful hits and dodge attacks, the gauge increases. Once filled up, it will go up a rank. Stylish Rankings: If the player takes any damage, the gauge will be reset at a lower level and if the same attack is repeated over and over again, the gauge will not increase until a new one is performed. In addition, players are free to choose how to go about each mission through Styles, which change the way Dante fights, thus allowing diverse ways to gain Stylish points. Trickster focuses on evasion techniques, allowing the player to deftly dodge attacks of any kind. They essentially increase Dante's speed and helps increase the Stylish gauge by using such evasive abilities. Swordmaster focuses on Devil Arms/melee combat. It allows maximum use of such weapons to their fullest extent and is recommended for those, who prefer close-quarters combat. Gunslinger brings about the best in each firearm allowing the player to unleash devastating firepower at a distance. Royalguard is arguably the strongest and hardest style to master. It allows the player to effectively guard and counter any attack delivered towards Dante and turn their powers back at them. Recommended for expert players, Royalguard is the hardest to master, but once perfected, makes Dante invincible. Later in the game, players can gain two extra styles: Quicksilver, which slows down time while allowing the player to move at normal speed, and Doppelganger, which animates the user's shadow to assist in offense.Special Edition  Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition is a re-release of Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening with an impressive list of added content:Plot  Devil May Cry 3 begins with Dante, in his yet-to-be-named shop, where he has a call from a needy customer, but mentions he hasn't started business. Eventually as he digs into a pizza from a pizza box, an individual named Arkham comes in and speaks to its owner about him being the son of Sparda, where he is told by his older twin brother Vergil about the history of their father and hopes he can accept an invitation. The visitor vanishes and as Dante picks up a pizza, the \"invitation\" arrives and was an onslaught of demons. Afterwards, as Dante keeps the demons at bay, he leaves his shop to beat more demons as an enormous tower, the Temen-ni-gru,\u00a0emerges in the background. As Dante progresses, he sets off to Vergil's \"invitation\" and begin a quest. When coming across the entrance to the tower, Dante faces Cerberus (a massive three-headed hellhound) who warns Dante that he, because he looks like other humans, that he isn't welcome in the region, nor the tower.\u00a0Dante defeats the demon\u00a0where it has belief that Dante is unlike any other human. He is unsure about his true \"nature\", but Cerberus nonetheless offers his soul (the first of many bosses that give Dante weapons after defeat) as a weapon to give Dante\u00a0protection against further danger. Dante then is shown up by a woman on a motorcycle (given the name Lady) who doesn't waste time and passes by Dante, where he gets more motivated to go into the tower. The plan of the stranger and Vergil are seen to prevent any intruders from stopping the secret intentions, which is seen when they seek\u00a0Dante's half of the Perfect Amulet,\u00a0which\u00a0is the only momento left from their mother, which the hidden power is to join the other half and open the door to the Demon World within the tower (in\u00a0a function similar to a Hell Gate.) The man who is preventing an \"unwelcomed guest\" is Arkham, who has a known bond with the woman, and this \"woman\" is revealed to be Mary, his\u00a0daughter. Mary comes to the tower to kill her father because he sacrificed her mother to gain power. The four characters do tasks and goals to meet at the same place overtime. While progressing sections of the tower, most get encounters with demons and Dante comes across a fifth, more unknown character by the four, named Jester, who has knowledge of the tower and most of its functions, as he hides and takes his true form revealed later. Dante comes across Mary again and have an argument and different \"beliefs\" where he nicknames her \"Lady\" to escape while she is forced to take the job to finish the demons for him. Facing demons and many puzzles, Dante makes it to his brother at the peak of the tower, and he is dissapointed that nothing was preparred the way he wants. Vergil instead was busy waiting to fight him, and as they\u00a0fight each other\u00a0brutally, Vergil overwhelmed his brother and stabbed him with his Yamato. When Dante resisted and tried to keep going (to get his amulet and sword back to continue), Vergil uses his younger brother's own sword to make sure he was dead. Where Dante is assumed to be dead, his sword \"tastes\" Dante's blood that builds up his dormant devil powers and when the energy\u00a0explodes, triggering his true form of his \"power\", Dante falls unconsious, and when he awakens, he finds his true might and heads out to get back to Vergil as fast as possible. When Dante was busy escaping the Leviathan's body, Arkham and Vergil make it to the tower's door and figure out a way to open it to proceed\u00a0to the control room located at the tower's basement, where Vergil is taunted and told that he is a joke for being more human than demon, he impales Arkham and slays him as he does\u00a0not need his help anymore. When he is on his own, Vergil uses the pieces of the spell while keeping anything away from him (which was Beowulf, who stopped his tracks with scent, where Vergil takes his essence to aid him by swift force). When Dante comes to see Vergil's struggle, noticing he is trying to get the tower awakened, he taunts him to keep him distracted in a battle. As Vergil takes his chance to get more of Sparda's blood in his brother to reactivate the tower, they become\u00a0very busy with the\u00a0fight and are seen by Lady who steps in a forbiddon area not meant for humans. As they are all busy stopping each other, Lady thinks Vergil corrupted her father, but was in fact manipulated, and where they continue, Jester comes in and applauds their efforts for helping him get his desire. Arkham evades their attacks and overpowers their attempts to stop him who eventually tells that Vergil is missing one key to get the Force Edge, a force that has Sparda's power filled in it and to become a new god, Arkham stabs Lady with her bladed part of her cannon\u00a0to get the blood that belonged to her ancestor that Sparda killed to supress the force of the tower to open the gate. When the start of the process that the tower awakened with Dante, Vergil and Lady's blood, Arkham is brought up to the summit by the elevator that he is on and waits for his chant and the bells (which were a mystery until now) to be put together. Vergil is also seen unconsious while the two continue onwards. Dante progresses his own path and when chasing with the fatiqued Lady, he takes the chance to face her father for her and leave her out. Lady stubbornly fights Dante, who is seen unstoppable for her to do this task and when he comes in a peaceful way up to her. Dante soon tells her about his purpose; he cares to stop her father, and when Lady gets enough information for him to be trusted, she gives him the Kalina Ann, where she waits until the fight is over. When Dante comes to the top and into the tower, after finishing the strange encounter with his shadow, Doppleganger,\u00a0he comes to Arkham in a strange area within the Demon World. When Dante is disgusted by Arkham pretending to be his true father and how it was a disgrace, he is later overwhelmed with the power and is pushed into becoming a blob-like creature. He battles Dante in an effort to be powerful by any means necessarry. In the battle, as Dante was busy with Arkham, Vergil appears and takes his stand against the two to get power, he and Dante\u00a0take on Arkham for not backing away from something very hard to have a grasp of control over. As the brothers are hindered of their weapons and Dante has one of his guns knocked out his hand, they remininsce their old, childhood saying \"Jackpot!\" and with the weakened Arkham taken out, he is kicked out of the Demon World and drops to the tower's top in a hard force that paralyses his legs. Lady comes up to her father and as he pleades her assistance, she denies and abandons her name, while she also chooses to end his life (until ending up crying over her family's loss). Meanwhile in the demon world, Dante and Vergil face off to have control of the property to the sword, Dante is told to give up his amulet from his stubborn brother. Dante fights off his brother and ends him with a powerful slash at the timing of Vergil's swing, costing him to be wounded and soon enough fall off into the dark part of the Demon World. Where Dante escapes the soon-to-be closed and unstable portal, he takes the Force Edge and his\u00a0amulet half back with him. Returning to the Human World, Dante meets Lady outside the tower where she coins the phrase \"devil may cry\" while trying to comfort Dante over the loss of his brother. They form a friendship and the beginnings of a partnership in demon-slaying. He later on names his shop \"Devil May Cry\". By accomplishing certain conditions, there is an extra scene that shows Vergil's fate. Still in the Demon World, severely weakened, yet determined, he encounters Mundus, his father's old enemy, and charges into battle against him. His fate is later on revealed in Devil May Cry.Difficulty Modes  Devil May Cry 3 is said to be the most difficult game in the series, and the original release Is often regarded as one of the most difficult games of all time. Enemies and bosses generally get tougher while the player gets weaker as the difficulty increases.Weapons Devil Arms Fire Arms Costumes  Devil May Cry 3 boasts the most alternate costumes for Dante to date, with his DMC1 outfit, two \"coatless\" variants, a Sparda outfit, and two \"Super\" costumes. Vergil has his own set of wardrobe changes, including a coatless version of his standard look, a variant on Sparda's outfit where he is turned into Nelo Angelo upon his devil trigger and two \"Super\"costumes one for his reguar outfit and one for his corrupted outfit.Awards  In the edition packaged with the Devil May Cry HD Collection, players can unlock PS3 Trophies and Xbox 360 Achievements for progressing in the story and other things in the gameTrivia See also Alastor  Alastor is a living Devil Arm, the \"Thunder Sword\" and \"Spirit of Lightning\", appearing in Devil May Cry. It is also one of the two keys alongside Ifrit that can unlock Dante's inner power. It can only be wielded by the \"chosen one\" who can conquer it, but it is able to grant its possessor lightning speed and aerial capability.Appearance  Alastor has a guard with a dragon head with two wings biting onto a golden blade. The hilt has a swirling pattern leading to skulls at the bottom with a spike pointing out.Gameplay  In terms of raw damage, Alastor retains a function towards Force Edge, it is slightly faster than Yamato in Legendary Dark Knight Mode but it is rougher in damage than the two. It shows less attack strength than Ifrit, but its lightning element gains an edge. In Devil Trigger, attacks are given more speed, but Dante can also fly, attack with more barrel roll-based Vortex attacks, and shoot pure lightning bolts during Air Raid which are more powerful than Dante's Ebony & Ivory or Sparda's Luce & Ombra. The DT Alastor is said by fans to be similar in strength to the Sparda sword and it is demonstrated by the shapeshifting and large curve of the godly blade. (This is also because of Sparda's huge bulk of the special, telescopic parts adding more weight to the damage) Aside from combat gameplay, if the Alastor is equipped, the menu screens will be completely coated in walls of lightning. Also, if you get the Ifrit and Sparda, the lightning will merge with fire and red faint sparks in the Divinity Statue menu.Alastor the Thunder Devil  Dante finds Alastor impaled through the chest of a sculpture of an agonized woman, and it speaks to Dante of its intent to enslave him. It flies through the air and nails him to the ground, but he removes and subdues it, becoming one with it in the process. After that point, Dante can use Devil Trigger and channel Alastor's power, enhancing his attacks with lightning and allowing him to take the form of a winged, tailed Demon.Other appearances Viewtiful Joe  Alastor's manifested spirit, Blade Master Alastor, appears as a recurring boss and sometimes as a playable character in the Viewtiful Joe series, also by Capcom. It is revealed in Dante's story line of the game that Alastor has left the sword due to Dante's carelessness. Dante responds by saying Alastor \"really knows how to hold a grudge.\" Also, Dante wields the Alastor during his appearances in Viewtiful Joe and Viewtiful Joe: Red Hot Rumble.Sengoku Basara  Alastor also appears as one of the final weapons for Date Masamune in Sengoku Basara 2, and there are six copies of Alastor that Date Masamune can use. When you first acquire Alastor with Azure Dragon, it is actually called \"Azure Prophet\".Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate  Alastor appears as a craftable weapon for palicoes by using 2 \"Amulet Keepsake\"s from the mission \"Gravios May Cry\".Monster Hunter World  Alastor, along with Force Edge was shown in a teaser of a Devil May Cry themed expansion in Monster Hunter as a celebration for the launch of the DMC: HD Collection on PS4, Xbox One and PC in March 13th 2018, Alastor, along with DMC Dante costume can be get by playing a event mission.Background  Alastor, meaning \"Avenger\", was a genius\u00a0or spirit of familial feuds in classical mythology, and encouraged violent retribution. In this respect, it often referred to Zeus, the lightning god. In Christian demonology, it became the chief executioner of Hell.Trivia Nevan (Devil Arm)  Nevan is a curious, guitar-like Devil Arm appearing in Devil May Cry 3 which originates from Nevan the Lightning Witch. Dante can control powerful electricity and bloodthirsty bats by jamming on Nevan, and its sickle attack is deadly. It is described as being \"charged from the heavens\".Appearance and Description  Nevan consists of two forms in one. It is a purple, one neck guitar with many electric strings and some skeletal-looking features. It hides or cloaks a three pronged scythe underneath, which is basically folded into it (The scythe itself can fold backwards via \"Distortion\"). Also, it can use a pack of bats and electricity that will support the guitar, either firing off as a similar function to mid-ranged bullets, or in defensive purposes surround as a protective wall for the user.Gameplay  Nevan plays completely different than any other Devil Arm in Dante's arsenal as it is quite complex and methodical to use in battle, requiring a plethora of skill and understanding of its mechanics to use properly. Rather than physically attack outright, Nevan's main feature is to summon multiple projectiles, and to boast attacks with wide fields of effect, making it a mix between a projectile and a melee weapon. These attacks by Nevan are intricate and consist of two unique types: \"Playing Attacks,\" and \"Regular Attacks.\" While Nevan's attacks are potentially damaging, summoned bats do not boast much stopping power alone, requiring full power through focused barrages. Any sort of true melee and stopping power is only found in the sound blast fields and physical attacks. While Nevan's scythe based attacks are deadly to its namesake, such heavy hitting capabilities near and far only come through when nearly all abilities from the Goddess Statues are purchased, the Swordmaster Style is selected, and use of the style is mastered. Because of its limited capabilities for chaining direct melee damage and limitations by Styles and Abilities, it is difficult to raise the Stylish Rank with the Nevan on Combat Adjudicators on its most minimal settings, which makes it boast lower Style rankings than Adjudicators for Dante's other weapons. In actual battle, the weapon works as a ranged crowd control weapon, heavy hitter, and gradual destroyer of many speeds, with its bat swarms responsible for chaining to the Stylish Rank and direct melee hits adding bigger boosts in return.Trivia Characters  This category is for the characters of the Devil May Cry series. To add an article, image, or category to this category, append  to the end of that page.Eva  Eva was the human wife of Sparda and mother of the twins Vergil and Dante. Little is known about Eva. She appears only as a photo on Dante's desk and as a voice in a flashback in the first Devil May Cry game.Background  Eva is an alternate spelling for Eve, who in the Bible is said to have been the first woman created by God. Eve is infamous for having been tempted by the serpent to eat the Forbidden Fruit, which led to Adam and Eve being exiled from the Garden of Eden as punishment for succumbing to temptation. In some versions, she is a replacement for Adam after God's previous creation, Lilith, who abandoned Adam and became a demon.Story  For Dante and Vergil's 8th birthday, she gave each of the boys one half of Sparda's Perfect Amulet. Afterward, she was killed in a demon attack ordered by Mundus. She hid Dante underneath two stones and told him never to come out, no matter what. She gave her life for her sons. It is unclear where Vergil was at this time. Eva's death is most likely the event that shaped the paths Dante and Vergil took, causing Dante to fight demons and Vergil to search for Force Edge. After Dante grew to adulthood, Trish was made by Mundus to look like Eva in order to manipulate Dante. Dante's lingering feelings for Eva are most clearly seen when Trish is saved by Dante despite her already betraying him.Devil May Cry Volume 1  Eva is featured in a flashback in which she hides Dante and attempts to protect Vergil during the attack in which she was killed and Vergil was kidnapped. While subsequent works, particularly the Devil May Cry 3 manga, have left this mostly intact, but have also omitted Vergil's presence at the site of Eva's murder thus leaving the details of Vergil's whereabouts at that time in mystery.Devil May Cry Volume 2  In a parallel universe that Dante and Beryl visit in which Mundus has virtually conquered the Human world, Eva supported her late husband's armies in resistance to Mundus's rule. It is also strongly implied that her emotional support after Sparda's fall was the only reason Mundus hadn't completed his conquest of the Human world. After hearing that story about this universe's Eva, Dante comments something along the lines of \"she's the same in every universe.\"Other Appearances Viewtiful Joe  Mundus makes a cameo appearance in this game in which he delivers a rant and proclaims that \"The real enemy was you, Eva!\", implying that she had planned out his defeat in Devil May Cry just before her death years in advance prior to the events of that game.Bayonetta  Eva, and her husband Sparda are both referenced within the description of the Bracelet of Time accessory in Bayonetta, and it's sequel. This would imply that not only was Eva her self a powerful Umbran Witch, with mastery over time control magic, but also participated in the battle against Mundus's Forces alongside Sparda.Trivia See also Dante (DmC)  Dante is the protagonist of the rebooted portion of the Devil May Cry series. He is a demon-angel hybrid known as a Nephilim, who lives as a demon hunting vigilante. He is counted by the officials of his hometown of Limbo City as a member of an organization of \"terrorists,\" and is being pursued by both national and worldwide authorities. Dante himself is a young and rebellious social outcast. He lives and fights in Limbo City, where demons seemingly influence every aspect of the world and the social condition of the humans living there.Appearance  Dante stands at around six feet and with a more rounded face, a small scar going across his right eyebrow and cheek, and wider jaw than he was in the TGS 2010 trailer, as the character model was updated to resemble the actor portraying him, Tim Phillipps, and his eye color seems to be grey-blue. His hair is black, with the sides of his head shaved, forming a mohawk out of the hair at the top of his head, tapering off into a point at the nape of his neck. As the game progresses, the hair at the back of his head can be seen changing permanently white. He also sports a strange glowing tattoo on his back between his shoulder blades. In one trailer, this tattoo glows briefly and heals scars he has on his back, and during gameplay it can be seen through his coat as he switches to an angelic or demonic weapon, which is also accompanied by a blue or red color. His attire consists of a faded black, 3/4-length, hooded leather jacket with red interior linings and the British Union flag sewn on the left arm, a gray tanktop, black fingerless gloves, black faded jeans, black military boots, and a necklace reminiscent of half of the Perfect Amulet that features prominently throughout the series. His sword is slung over his back favoring his left hand, and his pistols are placed in holsters at the back of his waist, under his coat. Dante also seems to be ambidextrous, favoring either hand for melee attacks with his weapons. When Dante uses Devil Trigger, his hair is flushed completely white, his coat becomes bright red, his eyes become red with white irises and small vein-like cracks run across his skin. These effects fade when Devil Trigger deactivates, but after his final battle his hair remained white permanently.Personality  The new Dante's personality is similar to the original Dante's, but because of the change in setting and his past, there are a few pronounced differences in some of the ways Dante interacts with others, especially demons. Otherwise, the young man carries himself in the same slick, confident manner as his counterpart, albeit with a more vulgar and spiteful tone. Dante is very rebellious towards authority figures, but laid-back to anyone else. Living on the periphery of society and caught between two worlds, he feels like an outcast. Young and angry, but with a quick wit and black humor, he is disaffected and disassociated with society, and seemingly quite apathetic. He has no fear, and no respect for authority, especially not the demonic authority that runs the world in which he lives. He has no qualms with engaging in debauchery and other hedonistic acts, mostly because he believes he won't be around for too much longer, because of all the demons constantly breathing down his neck. However, Dante has a huge heart beneath all of this rough exterior. He purposely chose to live out his life his own way because his eyes were opened to evil as a child, especially when the people who were supposed to take care of him turned out to be demons. He decided to take a stand and fight back, no matter what happens. But even after all of the hatred, violence and murder, Dante would often look at himself and see if he could call himself human, going so far as to rip his chest open to see his own heart. He just knew that he had to convince himself he wasn't insane. Dante displays a more caring side to his female associate, Kat, telling her to leave him and find safety when they come under attack, and even risking The Order's plans to save her life.Story  Dante is the elder child of an angel named Eva and the demon Sparda, and seemingly hunts down other demons in the twisted shadows of Limbo City, while slowly coming to grips with his ethereal powers. Dante grew up in various institutions, orphanages, youth correction facilities, and foster homes, but these were mostly operated by demons, and often resulted in torture and violence. Dante has therefore developed a deep hatred of demons and authority in general, but tries to stay incognito. In spite of this he attracts attention thanks to his violent tendencies and the actions of the demons against him. Dante is not subtle in his war against them, even going so far as punching out a bouncer in front of a group of people in order to enter a nightclub run by demons. The demons are even less subtle when fighting Dante, perfectly willing to tear apart Limbo City to subdue him. These mutual acts of sabotage have allowed the demons to use the media to portray Dante as public enemy number one. One night, after having a wild time at Devil's Dalliance, Dante was careless and allowed a Hunter to track him. At his trailer, he is woken up by Kat, who warns him that he's being followed. Suddenly, the Hunter appears and pulls Dante into Limbo. As it destroys his trailer, Dante quickly puts on his clothes and finds himself surrounded by demons. Defeating them, he encounters Kat again, who explains that she's a psychic and can see him, even though she's in the real world, and she wants to help him. Dante initially turns down her offer, but Kat warns him that he shouldn't fight the Hunter. Following Kat to the rift, Dante fends off against the Hunter's attacks, including the rip-off of the Ferris wheel. He tries to use Ebony & Ivory, but Kat informs him that it's bulletproof. After she throws a Wiccan-charmed bottle at its face and weakens it, Dante fights and defeats the Hunter. With its dying breaths, it calls him the Son of Sparda and tells him that he is dead just like his mother, the \u201cwhore\u201d. Dante replies that he doesn't know who his mother was, but the Hunter wasn't the first to call him a son of a bitch. He then kills the demon and returns to the real world, with the pier heavily destroyed due to the battle in Limbo. Holding his pendant, Dante thinks of Eva, whom he barely remembers. As he leaves the pier, Kat finds him again, informing him that her boss knows him and wants to meet him. Although resisting at first, he eventually accepts and Kat drives him into Limbo City. She reveals to Dante that she's part of the Order, and the man in the mask that frequently appears on the news is her boss. Arriving at the entrance of the Order, Dante comments that it wasn't what he expected because it looks like a small garage, and Kat replies that was the idea, since the real entrance is well hidden. As they enter, she goes on and tells him that the demons are enslaving mankind, and the Order is fighting against them as the last line of defense. Then they enter a room, where a man dressed in black was waiting for them. Seeing that Dante doesn't recognize him, the man reveals himself to be Vergil, his long lost twin brother and the establisher of the Order. Vergil asks Dante to join with him in fighting the demons and saving mankind. But Dante declines, stating that he's the loner type. Stating that leaving will be a mistake, Vergil asks Dante to give him a chance to show the truth about who he is. Dante is then brought to Paradise, Dante and Vergil's home which has been long abandoned. There, Kat opens a gateway, allowing Dante to enter Limbo and find out about his past. While exploring the mansion, he comes across a torn portrait of his father Sparda with a winged carving at the base engulfed with a demonic aura. Upon touching it, Dante gains the Arbiter. As he regains his childhood memories, he stumbles across an insignia which resembles the tattoo on his back. He is suddenly transported into another dimension, where he finds a large stone statue that is chained down. Dante gains the demonic form of the Ophion and breaks one of the chains. When he returns to Limbo, he finds another portrait, this time of his mother Eva, with a winged carving, shining with an angelic blue. As he touches the carving, Dante obtains Osiris. Continuing his search, Dante finds a blue rose, which takes him back to the dimension from before. He gains the angelic form of the Ophion and breaks another chain. Later, Dante finds a picture of Sparda, Eva, Vergil and himself. He suddenly remembers everything. Eva gave him his pendant when he was a child, and he would have spars with Vergil, often winning them easily. They were a family, until Mundus and his demon army found them. He broke into the mansion and killed Eva, ripping her heart out right in front of Dante's eyes. Sparda quickly took his sons and escaped, erasing their memories and separating them. He hid them among the humans to keep them safe from Mundus. Returning to the real world, Dante confirms with Vergil that they are indeed twin brothers, the latter showing his blue pendant that Eva gave to him. Vergil informs Dante that their father Sparda has been eternally banished, condemned to a fate far worse than death. Dante tells Vergil that he wants to know more, and they, along with Kat, leave the mansion. Dante and Vergil then travel to an old playground, where Eva used to take them to as children. It is here that Vergil reveals everything. Over 9000 years ago, Mundus became the supreme ruler of the demons with the help of Sparda, his most trusted lieutenant. But Sparda betrayed Mundus and fell in love with an angel, Eva. They union gave to a new kind of life: Nephilim, half-demon, half-angel hybrids. When Mundus learned of Sparda's betrayal, he became so furious and hunted the lovers down. He killed Eva and sentenced Sparda to endless punishment and pain. But the lovers knew that Mundus will soon be defeated by their sons, because only a Nephilim can kill a demon king. Also, Mundus believes that there's only one Nephilim, never learning of the other. To ensure that his sons can fight the demon king, Sparda gave the Rebellion to Dante and the Yamato to Vergil. Their conversation is interrupted when a Looker finds them, dragging Dante into Limbo. After fighting off a horde of demons, Dante tries to reunite with Kat, but the Limbo dimension separates them, creating a large space of distance. As he searches for another route, Dante finds another blue rose, which takes him back to the same dimension like before. This time, he learns how to glide when he jumps, allowing him to reach farther distances. Breaking another chain, Dante returns to Limbo and heads to Kat and the gate, making it safely to the real world. Back at the Order's hideout, Vergil shows Dante that Mundus rules the real world in his human guise, Kyle Ryder, CEO of Silver Sacks Tower. As a banker, Mundus controls everything through debt, making him superior over humans. He keeps the humans monitored with the Raptor News Network, and he makes them docile with the Virility soft drink. Mundus draws his powers through the Hell Gate, and is immortal when connected to it. Vergil plans to draw Mundus away from the gate by getting his attention, giving the brothers a chance to kill him. To make him notice, their strategy is to take down his soft drink plant and news corporation. Picking Virility as their first target, Dante and Kat head for the plant. Along the way, Dante knocks out a can from a man's hand, which catches the attention of a demonic camera. It pulls Dante into Limbo, but he quickly dispatches it. However he and Kat quickly discover that there are more demonic cameras throughout the city, and Limbo itself is trying to trap and kill him. While Kat leaves to avoid the cops, Dante destroys the cameras and avoids Limbo's traps. As he reunites with Kat at Saint Agares's Church, Limbo erupts into all out chaos. Dante quickly makes his way to her gateway marked on the glass window, shattering it into pieces as he escapes Limbo. As they enter the Virility factory, Kat informs Dante that he needs to destroy the secret ingredient of the drink: an ancient succubus named Poison that lies deep within the facility. Since the only way of reaching Poison is through Limbo, Dante and Kat head for the rift located in the storage room. After Dante enters Limbo, Kat instructs him to retrace his steps back to the mixing room and meet her there. When he reaches the room, he finds grotesque tubes feeding into the mixing tanks that people sampled cups of Virility from in the real world. Reaching the air duct, Dante travels down the tunnel with the help of Kat's \u201cegg-timer.\u201d Going on his own, he finds Poison who calls him the Son of Sparda and Eva the \u201cwhore.\u201d After they shouted cusses at each other, Dante battles and defeats the succubus by cutting the lines that held her, causing her to fall into the rancid waters. But as he makes his way out, she resurfaces and battles him again. Dante fights back and causes Poison to fall with the current towards the stirring rotors. As she tries to cling on, he breaks her grip and she is caught within the rotors, sliced up into pieces by the blades. With Poison's death, Dante obtains the Eryx gauntlets. With their sights now on the Raptor News Network, Dante and Kat head to meet up with Vergil. While she is driving, Dante asks why she's so close to his brother, saying that he wants to know her reasons why she's helping Vergil. He states his appreciation for her help, even though he didn't ask for it, and he wants her to trust him since he trusts her. After learning of Kat's horrific pasts, Dante promises that he'll stick with her and his brother to the end. They reunite with Vergil at a city bridge, where they can clearly see the Raptor News Tower. To destroy the network, Dante must take out the demon that is running it: Bob Barbas. With Kat's glyph on the bridge, Dante falls through and enters Limbo, which is not the river but an upside-down realm. He discovers that the network tower is disguised as a reflection on the river in the human world, commenting that he understands why Bob's point of view is \u201cso upside down.\u201d As he heads for the tower, Dante discovers Bob's penitentiary, which is filled with human souls that are tortured cruelly. Later on, his path is obstructed when the train rails he is walking on is destroyed. He then spots a blind old demon, Phineas, helplessly fighting off harpies. After learning of Dante's intentions of killing Bob, the prophet offers his help in return for a favor: the retrieval of his cybernetic right eye. As Phineas calls for the harpies and distracts them, Dante heads for their nest, where the eye is located. After he obtains the eye, he fights and kills the harpies that surrounded him and later returns to Phineas. Dante keeps up his end of their deal and gives the prophet his eye. When Phineas' vision is returned, he sees Dante and recognizes him as Sparda's son and a Nephilim. With his part done, Dante is led by Phineas to the Raptor News Tower. Along the way, Dante is brought to a statue containing the soul of Assiel, who was a Nephilim just like him. Phineas tells him that there were other Nephilim before, but they were hunted down and killed because of their formidable powers and great potential. For Dante to reach his own potential, Phineas suggests for him to go to Assiel, who may hold the key. When Dante approaches Assiel, she recognizes him as one of her own kind and shows him an emblem. As he grabs it, he is transported into the other dimension. When Dante breaks the final chain, his pendant begins to glow and the statue begins to move. As it opens its arms, the mirror at its chest glows brightly, and Dante sees a message left by his own mother. Eva apologizes to him for not being able to protect him. She tells him that she's giving him a choice that she and Sparda never gave to him: a great power to forge his own path. That power is freedom. Eva tells Dante to be brave and that she loves him. Dante's Devil Trigger is then unleashed, granting him power that is greater than anything he had before. When he returns to Limbo, Phineas comments that he's found his inner devil, but has not reached his full potential yet. Dante replies that he just wants to kill Mundus, but the prophet asks who will take the demon king's place, leaving the Nephilim utterly confused. Reaching the tower, Phineas says that he cannot go further because he cannot fight anymore, but Dante thanks him regardless. The prophet states that he helped because he believes that Dante may stand a chance against Mundus. His faith in the Nephilim was strengthened because he saw not only Sparda, but Eva as well in him. Dante learns from Phineas that Mundus has one weakness: his mistress, Lilith, is bearing his child. Nothing will hurt Mundus more than their deaths, since the child is his heir. But the prophet warns Dante that the fury of the demon king is boundless and thousands might perish. After Phineas prepares the way one last time, he disappears, and Dante continues on his own. As he gets closer to the tower, a giant beam shoots out, hindering his path, and he realizes that he has Bob's attention. Entering the tower, Dante discovers Bob in his demonic form and battles him, punching him with \u201chard hitting news.\u201d In the midst of the fight, Bob reports that SWAT teams have begun raiding The Order's hideout, targeting Vergil and Kat. With his anger raging, Dante defeats Bob and shoots his human form, killing him. As Dante returns to the human world, he gains the Aquila blades. Rushing back to the hideout, Dante finds that the SWAT teams have not found a way inside the hideout yet, prompting him to hurry and find Kat and Vergil. A Looker, disguised as a SWAT member, spots Dante and pulls him into Limbo, making him unable to save the members of the Order as they are shot and killed by SWAT. However he finds Kat, who is terrified and confused but safe. She tells him that Vergil is in the Octagon room, trapped in Limbo. They hurry to Vergil, with Dante helping Kat avoid capture. As they reach the Octagon, Dante saves Vergil by killing the Butcher that was cornering him. He then rushes for them to leave, but Vergil refuses, as he is trying to destroy reliable data and their plans so he can prevent SWAT from getting their hands on them. Kat proceeds to activate the self-destruct, as it can only be done in the real world. Having no other choice, Dante fends off against the onslaught of demons, receiving the Revenant shotgun from Vergil. As Kat and Vergil finish, SWAT has almost broken through. Dante refuses to leave Kat behind, but she and Vergil tell him that she cannot escape. Telling his brother to go on ahead, Dante tells Kat not to fight back and he promises that he'll come back for her. He watches in despair as two SWAT members shoot Kat in the shoulder, beat her mercilessly and drag her unconscious body away by her legs. Dante quickly catches up with Vergil and they exit Limbo, leaving the hideout behind as it is destroyed. Later, they receive a video message from Mundus, who tells Vergil to trade Dante in for Kat. As Vergil refuses to take a high risk and rescue Kat, Dante insist that they save her, but use Lilith as the trade since she bears Mundus' child. Vergil eventually agrees, although he still thinks that it is a waste to save Kat. After learning that Lilith is the owner of Devil's Dalliance, Dante heads for the nightclub. He knocks out the bartender with an uppercut and goes inside with no problem, avoiding one of his ex-lovers. After Dante is spotted by a Looker, a spotlight is placed on him, and Lilith drags him into Limbo. As he states that he's after her, Lilith forces him into playing \u201cThe Devil has Talent\u201d game show. He must pass all of the levels to get an audience with her so she can kill him, but if he fails, then both he and Kat will die. When Dante passes all of the levels, he battles Lilith and her child. Defeating them, he points Rebellion at Lilith, promising that he'll spare her and the child if she does exactly as he says. As she quickly submits, Dante brings her with him. He then has Vergil send a video message to Mundus, stating his counter proposal for the trade: Kat's life for the life of the child. Dante and Vergil set up the trade at the shipping docks. They release Lilith as a SWAT team comes and gives Kat. The trade goes well until Vergil shoots and kills Lilith, along with the child. As both sides begin shooting at each other, Dante hurries to save Kat while Vergil kills the SWAT team. Suddenly, Dante is sucked into Limbo by Mundus, who is horrified with the death of his heir. Dante hurries through the chaotic dimension and protects Vergil and Kat from large debris that gets into their car's path. Getting back to the safe house, Dante and Vergil learn from Kat that since Mundus is weakened from his last outburst, this is their chance to kill him. After she shows them a map of Silver Sacks Tower, they go and make their last stand against the demon king. Dante storms through the front doors of the tower and gets Mundus' attention while Vergil sneaks inside from the back to get to the security room undetected. Dragged into Limbo by the demon king, Dante fights his way through the tower as his brother helps him by overriding the security. During one of their brief reunions, Dante receives the Kablooey firearm from Vergil. Breaking into the main core of the tower, he makes his way through the Furnace of Souls and returns to his brother one last time, going together for the final showdown with the demon king. However, the vault to Mundus's office is suddenly closed, forcing Dante and Vergil to reactivate the four generators that power the vault. Once it opens, Dante goes in alone to draw Mundus out, while Vergil waits for the right moment to sneak inside and close the Hell Gate. As Dante finally confronts Mundus face to face, the demon king asks him why he killed the child. Dante replies that he did it for the freedom of mankind, but Mundus questions his answer, explaining that humans misuse their freedom on each other with violence and war. Dante then changes his answer, saying that he killed Mundus' child to avenge Eva's death. He taunts the demon king, saying how priceless it was watching the child die. Enraged, Dante is blasted out of the office by Mundus, who then rushes and grabs him as they zoom out of the tower. On top of another building, he is pinned down as Mundus digs his fingers into Dante chest for his heart. Unable to fight back, Dante slowly loses his conscience as his mother's murder flashes through his eyes. But Vergil successfully closes the Hell Gate and saves Dante, stabbing the now mortal Mundus. Dante then pushes the demon king off the roof, spitting on him as he falls on a car below. However, Mundus rises up as his true form and battles the brothers. Dante keeps Mundus distracted while Vergil opens the third eye. But when Mundus overpowers Vergil, Dante unleashes his Devil Trigger and stops the demon king, allowing Vergil to projectile a sword and open the eye. Taking the opportunity, Dante pulls out Mundus' eye with Ophion and punches him in the face with Eryx, severely damaging Mundus. But the demon king pulls Dante off his face and slams him into a nearby building, deactivating his Devil Trigger and rendering him unconscious. As Dante falls, Vergil quickly teleports and saves him, landing safely inside. Looking back, they see that Mundus is showing cracks, and his true body is at the core. But as Mundus attacks them again, Vergil is sucked into the core, pulled in and attacked by the demon's true body. Meanwhile, Dante fights Mundus, destroying his arms and severing his eyes. With the outer shell weakened, Dante rushes inside and slices Mundus' true body. He then grabs Vergil and escapes as the demon king explodes. Reuniting with Kat, the three of them look out from the old playground at what's happened to the city, since Limbo has collapsed into the real world. Dante claims that the humans are now free, but Vergil shows his true colors, stating that they can now rule mankind. He explains that his plan was for him and Dante to rule the humans together. Dante then realizes that all this time, they were fighting for Vergil's freedom from Mundus so he can rule himself. Vergil claims that humans are frail and helpless and they, the Nephilim, saved them from Mundus. But Dante disapproves, saying that if it wasn't for Kat, a human, then they wouldn't have defeated Mundus. Refusing to stand aside and let Vergil take the demon king's place, Dante draws Rebellion and battles Vergil, but holds back to try to reason with him until Vergil is able to catch Dante off-guard and attack him with great force, which infuriates Dante enough that he finally goes all out and the brothers release their Devil Triggers, unleashing their full powers on each other. But in the end, Dante wins as he always had did with all their childhood fights and stabs Vergil at the heart, pinning him down. As he drives Rebellion deeper, Kat pleads for him to stop, begging him to have mercy on Vergil, so Dante relents, withdrawing his Rebellion. Helping Vergil to his feet, Dante states that the world is under his protection, but Vergil scoffs that Dante's chosen the wrong side and will never be human. Dante and Kat glumly watch as Vergil uses the Yamato to open a rift, then rebukes Dante for spurning his brother. Dante, unsure of who he is anymore, is reassured by Kat that he is himself, nothing more nor less, as Dante's eyes begin to glow a demonic red.Other Appearances Playstation All-Stars Battle Royale  Dante appears as a playable character in Playstation All-Stars Battle Royale. His rival in Arcade Mode is Nariko from Heavenly Sword. Most of his moves are copied from DmC Devil May Cry. His Level 1 Super is a copy of Drive's animation. His Level 2 Super is the Stinger move. He goes into Devil Trigger mode in his Level 3 Super, he can do any of his default attacks and will kill any player in one hit while in DT. His blocking animation is very similar to the original Dante's Royalguard animation in Devil May Cry 3, although not as effective.Marvel Vs. Capcom: Infinite  While the original Dante is the character featured in the game, he is given a Nephilim skin that turns him into his alternate universe counterpart. In this game, the original Dante is given rather aggressive traits to the point of antagonism that make his skin change to his Nephilim counterpart seamless, closely matching his alternate universe counterpart.Weapons  He also has his trusty Ebony & Ivory, a pair of semi-automatic pistols; one silver, Ivory, and one black, Ebony, with curved grips, and engraved actions resembling the Desert Eagle's, the possible basis for the weapons. Dante also once again wields the franchise staple shotgun called the Revenant and a dart-shooting gun called Kablooey. The design philosophy behind both Rebellion and Ebony & Ivory is to create the impression that they were crafted a long, long time ago, and since their creation, they have sent innumerable demons to their doom.Powers and Abilities  As a Nephilim, Dante posses a wide vairety of supernatural abilities enjoyed by demons and angels alike. He is also capable of destroying the demon king due to his lineage.Powers  Supernatural strength: Dante is strong enough to punch Mundus' giant form with his bare hands and knock him back.

It is a customized version of the blades used by the Order of the Sword and designed by Agnus. It is not a Devil Arm, but its unique construction makes it just as powerful.Description  It has an ornately etched base, and appears to be modeled after the German Gro\u00dfes Messer (lit. \"Great Knife\"), but its most unique feature is that it has been specially customized with a motorcycle-like gear shift which, when pulled, sprays a flammable propellant across the blade and opponent, greatly increasing the power of its blows. This system, known as \"Exceed\", can be revved up to three times, and can be released either in one incredibly powerful strike, or three separate stinging blows. This system is also strong enough for Nero to be able to use it as a jet. This and several other modifications makes the Red Queen nearly impossible for anyone but Nero to wield.Gameplay  Red Queen focuses on wide, sweeping strikes and occasionally a 360 spin. Red Queen also has unique back-to-forward inputs for additional attacks. Combo A is a four strike combo that all of Red Queen's combos vary from. During Combo B, Nero repeatedly slams Red Queen into to enemy and can be extended if the player repeatedly presses the attack button. If the player remains idle after the last strike Combo B, Nero will rest Red Queen on his shoulder and hold that pose. Combo C consists of multiple 360 sweeps and is good for crowd control and defensive fighting. Combo D is almost the same as Combo A, except the finals strike has more power behind it. Streak is an ability that will propel Nero forward and swipe Red Queen on contact with the enemy and has a near 360 swing. High Roller is Red Queens launcher and Nero can rise with it. Shuffle is a counter attack that first consists of a slide back that consists of invincibility frames followed by an attack to push the enemy back. Red Queen has 4 basic aerial attacks. Aerial Combo is a three strike attack that throws the enemy to the ground. Roulette Spin's final hit sends the enemy higher in the air while gaining Nero more height allowing for more attacks. Split is an attack that slams Red Queen into the ground from the air. Calibur is an aerial equivalent to Streak.Exceed  The Exceed is a system unique for Red Queen. By revving the handle on the Red Queen, Nero can cause it to spray a flammable liquid over the blade, increasing the range and inflicted damage of its attacks. For certain techniques this changes their performance entirely. Because Exceeded attacks generate more style points and inflict more damage, mastering the technique is vital to competently playing as Nero. The basis of the system is the Ex-Gauge, which consists of three slots. The current charge can be seen to the left of the Vitality gauge, and the Red Queen also glows more strongly with each new charged slot. The easiest way to fill the Ex-Gauge is by making Nero twist the sword's handle by pressing /, which is called Exceed. However, regular boosting is slow and dangerous in the middle of the battle, so it is usually better to use EX-Act or purchasable MAX-Act abilities instead. They are performed by pressing the / at the right moment of an attack, usually when the sword connects with an enemy, although the timing is the same even if Nero is swinging at empty air. MAX-Act, which fills all three slots, will be performed if the timing is exact, though if it is off by a few frames of animation EX-Act will be performed instead, filling only one slot. If the Ex-Gauge is filled to any extent, the next attack becomes an EX attack. There are three levels of EX attacks, each new level requiring more filled slots in the Ex-Gauge than the previous. From the beginning only the first level of EX attacks is available, level two and three requiring Exceed 2 and Exceed 3 respectively.Exceed Enhanced Attacks  Certain Ex attacks will change the way an attack functions and use up the entire EX-Guage Ex Streak: Upon contact with the enemy, Nero does a full spin equivalent to the number of EX gauge slots filled while still pushing forward. EX High Roller: Nero will strike upwards equivalent to the number of slots filled in the Ex-Gauge, and the final strike will launch the enemy in the air. When rising with the enemy, Nero will spin on the way up corresponding the EX-Gauge. Ex Shuffle: A second strike is added to the counter-attack. Double Down: An enhanced Split attack in which Nero stabs Red Queen into the ground below. Ex Calibur: Ex Calibur will empty the Ex-Gauge like the other attacks but Calibur's functions remain the same. Interestingly, if Nero fills up an EX slot while in Devil Trigger state, his demonic aura rises and grows larger with each Exceed level. This is seen clearly when the player uses the Super Nero costume, as the Devil Trigger is infinite and the Red Queen has maxed-out Exceed level.Background  \"Roulette Spin\", \"Streak,\" \"Split,\" \"High Roller\", and \"Double Down\" are gambling and casino terms. Even the name \"Red Queen\" refers to the Queen of Hearts or Diamonds in a modern card deck. Furthermore, in the Devil May Cry 4: Deadly Fortune it is stated that Nero's moves are named after gambling/casino terms because Morihashi Bingo thought of him as a 'sink or swim' person. \"EX Calibur\" is a pun on the legendary sword of the same name which was wielded by King Arthur. Similarly, \"EX Act\" is a pun on how the move requires exact timing from the player.

In the film, she is re-imagined as a sultry but moral cartoon actress and singer at a Los Angeles supper club called the Ink and Paint Club.Appearances  Jessica is first seen from behind the stage curtains at the Ink and Paint Club, singing \"Why Don't You Do Right?\" After her show, followed by Eddie, Marvin Acme, owner of Toontown and founder of the Acme Corporation, enters her dressing room and informs her that she absolutely, truly, and honestly murdered the audience one night, and he means it.Personality  She attests to Eddie Valiant that \"I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.\" Indeed, she proves herself to be selfless and compassionate throughout the movie. Although she seems cool and distant, she has a soft spot for Roger, whom she married because he \"makes her laugh\", is a better lover than a driver and that he's magnificent and \"better than Goofy\". She calls him her \"honey bunny\" and \"darling\". She adores him beyond measure and is irrefutably loyal to him. As proof of her love, she tells Eddie that she'll pay any price for Roger and helps prove Roger innocent by assisting with the investigation. She makes it clear that despite what others think of her, she only has eyes for Roger and would do anything for his sake. She proves to be brave, quick-witted and intuitive; she knowingly puts herself at risk to save Roger and Eddie. Yet despite the danger, she maintains a calm composure and exhibits great skill in combat, including handling a gun.Relatives  Roger Rabbit (husband) Thumper (uncle in law) Mr. Hare (grandfather in law) Thumper's mother (grandmother in law) Miss Bunny (aunt in law) Thumper's sisters (aunts in law)Quotes  Jessica Rabbit/Quotes and Lines.Disney Fanon Wiki  This wiki is about Disney and PIXAR fanon games that can be made by anyone.

Lyrics for the songs are displayed on-screen with the Mickey Mouse icon as a \"bouncing ball\" (The concept, which was originated at the Fleischer Studios. In 1926, along with brother Dave, Max Fleischer patented the \"bouncing ball\" technique, by which a small animated ball would bounce over the words, cueing both the audience and the theater organist, in the silent Song Car-Tunes series. In 1928, the concept was revived as Screen Songs, to take advantage of techniques afforded by the sound era, and incorporating such musical guest stars as Ethel Merman and Rudy Vallee, or the text changing color as the song is sung, or a combination of the two. Early releases open with a theme song introduction (written by Patrick DeRemer) containing footage featuring Professor Owl (then voiced by Bill Thompson) and his class from the 1953 Disney shorts Melody and Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom.

He mentions whether they've found his son Poseidon yet. Also, he doesn't like Eric, and says to Ariel, \"Not a good choice, my dear. Rubbish, he is. Bothero!\". In the end, he becomes angry at his grandson, and says; \"I'm going to take back the sea from you, grandson! You're too irresponsible!\". Triton and Neptune have a big fight, and Hades, an old god with white fiery hair and a cane and glasses appears. He tries to keep the war going on, so more people die, but Ariel stands up to Neptune and Hades, and Eric does, too. They agree to stop fighting, and Hades goes off to sulk. Neptune grudgingly admits to Ariel about Eric, \"Not such a bad chap after all\".Dumbo 2 (TBA)  After accidentally getting disconnected from the circus, the baby animals end up in the big city and have to figure out how to get home.Mickey Mouse  Michael Jay \"Mickey\" Mouse is a mouse and the main character in the Disney Series. Being a toon, he can suffer major blows and survive. These include falls, concussions, gunshots, and decapitation. He also take off his ears and use them as weapons. He also appears as a playable character in the fighting game Disney Rumble.Appearance  Mickey Mouse is an anthropomorphic mouse with black fur, round ears of the same color, and a thin, long, black tail. His usual outfit in the Kingdom Hearts series is a modified version of the one he wears in modern Disney cartoons. He wears a short-sleeved jacket with white lining. The top half of this jacket is black, while the bottom half is red, and there are two yellow straps dangling in front of it. His pants are a pair of red overalls with red shoulder straps sometimes included. Each leg also has a yellow pouch with a black strap that partially cover the zipper, as well as a blue strap on the outer side of each pant leg. Mickey wears very large, yellow shoes with grey backs and two orange, intersecting straps attached to the front of each shoe. This design was eventually used as a base to create Sora's outfit in the first Kingdom Hearts. As he is not physically present until the final cutscene, at which point he is still only a silhouette, Jiminy was incapable of recording the King's outfit in the journal. However, if one looks closely, Mickey is wearing his normal Disney attire from his cartoons. Long ago, when Mickey was a resident of Timeless River, he looked different than he did in the present day. He is colored in grayscale like the other inhabitants of the world. He is modeled after his appearance in older Disney cartoons like Steamboat Willie. Mickey's face is white and his eyes are simple black ovals. His fur is black, as are his ears, which are simple black circles. Like in the older cartoons he is from, no matter which direction Mickey himself is facing, his ears are always facing the screen. He wears the famous white gloves common to many older Disney characters. His shorts are white and have two buttons on the front. His shoes are also white, and he does not wear a shirt. Mickey also sports a thin, long tail. In Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories, Mickey wears a black vest with white lining, two yellow buttons near the bottom, and a zipper that only reaches about halfway down the vest. Under this vest he wears a short-sleeved shirt that is seems to be the same black, white-lined color scheme as his vest, though the cuffs of the sleeves are red. His pants are red and quite baggy. The pockets have white lining. Similar to Goofy, the front of Mickey's pant legs are pulled up slightly by elastic, blue straps. Mickey's shoes here are also yellow, but the tips and lower halves are black and the soles are white. Each shoe has two blue straps that intersect over the top of the shoe. While training under Yen Sid during Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, Mickey's outfit is virtually identical to the way it looks in Kingdom Hearts II, except for the color: Mickey's clothing is colored in greyscale, losing all the colors it had, save for black, white, and grey, making it similar to Sora's Final Form outfit in Kingdom Hearts II. He also attacks using the teeth of his Star Seeker as opposed to the broad edge of the Kingdom Key D in Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, adding more contrast between his appearances in both games. During Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days and the early stages of Kingdom Hearts II, Mickey wears the black coat, gloves, and shoes that Organization XIII members wear. Though largely the same as the other coats, Mickey's apparently has contortions in the hood for his ears, and the drawstrings on his version sport Hidden Mickey symbols on the tips. In all of his appearances, except for when he wears the black coat, Mickey dons the famous, white gloves common to most older Disney characters.#1 Racer  Mickey appears playable in the game Disney Superstar Racing!!! as a default character and a great character for beginners.\u00a0Kingdom Hearts The Series  Mickey appears playable in the game Kingdom Hearts The Series as a default character and a great character for beginners.Kinect Disneyland Adventures  Mickey appears playable in the game Kinect Disneyland Adventures as a default character and a great character for beginners.Disney Magical World  Mickey appears playable in the game Disney Magical World as a default character and a great character for beginners.Disney Infinity  Mickey appears playable in the game Disney Infinity as a default character and a great character for beginners.Gallery  Disney Magical World: Mickey Mouse Kinect Disneyland Adventures: Mickey Mouse Mickey appears in Mickey, Donald and Goofy in The Three Musketeers, A Broadway AdventureQuotes  Mickey Mouse/Quotes and Lines.Videos  Voice Sounds: Mickey MouseLowly Worm  Lowly is Huckle's best friend.

In the show, Kermit,Gonzo and Fozzie are living together in the same house. The show also features two other segments which wrap around the main plot:Characters The Incredibles 2  The incredibles 2 is the sequel to the incredibles. The underminer is the villain of this film. At the beginning a purple portal opens up and a man who looks like Mr Incredible only he's not bald and he has a mustache and a beard appears. Dash asks the man who he is. He says he's Dash from the future. He tells them that the underminer kills them all except for him and Jack Jack so he must change time. \"Its cool that you're me from the future but it sucks that some of us get killed.\" said Dash. Then a dark brown haired teen boy with a page boy haircut and an incredibles uniform appeared. He told them he's Jack Jack from the future. But he told them to call him Jack. Future Dash says he tried to beat the underminer in his time but he was too powerful. The underminer has since taken control of the world and driven the \"surface dwellers\" underground - many have been enslaved and put to work in his mines, whilst others live a life of fear and evasion. A brave few have formed a resistance group which aims to oneday overthrow the underminer and free the worlds survivors to walk upon the earth's surface once more - but their efforts appear largely futile. Cities remain intact but exist as ghost-towns only. Many years have passed and the earth's forests and oceans have begun to recover from the previous centuries of man's exploitation. The underminer's propaganda machine refers to this 'grand cleansing' frequently and believes this will be his crowning legacy. \"The earth's vermin shall never be free to walk the earth again!\" \"Let them eat worms!\" Who can possibly save humanity from this tyrant? Will Dash and Jack be able to reverse the course of history? Can the Incredibles possibly hope to undermine the Underminer? Only an Incredibles sequel can tell....The Princess and the Pea  The Princess and the Pea is an upcoming 2012 2D animated film to be from Walt Disney and written and directed by Ron Clements and John Musker. It is based on the famous Hans Christian Anderson Fairy Tale and features the voice talents of Elena Satine, Gerard Butler, Joan Cusack, Angela Lansbury, Paul Reubens, Brian Cox, Abigail Breslin and Joaquin Phoenix.Story  A Prince (Gerard Butler) searches far and wide for a princess who at personality is an actual princess and has a heart of gold.

This Winnie the Pooh show is heavily based of off Winnie the Pooh and is the sixth Winnie the Pooh TV show after Welcome to Pooh Corner, The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh, The Book of Pooh, My Friends Tigger & Pooh, and the upcoming The Mini Adventures of Winnie the PoohCast & Characters Starring Character  Jim Cummings as Winnie the PoohMain Characters Major Characters  Non voiced characters include Balloon.Secondary Characters Minor Characters Episodes  List of The Classic Stories of Winnie the Pooh episodesReferences to related media Show-Within-a-Show  The show, The Ballads of Nessie, appears as a show within a show for this animated series.

She is voiced by Russi Taylor. Now In Show Mickey Mouse Clubhouse 2 In the 2017 Version Of Mickey Mouse Club [English Translation] She Not was Dead Will ReturnAppearance  Minnie Mouse is an anthropomorphized mouse with black fur and large, black, circular ears. She has long eyelashes and wears a gold tiara with a ruby Hidden Mickey-shaped symbol set in the middle. She wears an elegant ball gown with short, ball-shaped sleeves. The top of the gown is pink with red lining. The pink section sports a flower-like pattern inside circles that line the bottom. She wears another, salmon-colored layer underneath this, and a third, pleated, red layer under that. Minnie also wears white gloves that cover her whole arms and a large, red bow on the back of her dress. Interestingly, in Kingdom Hearts, whenever Minnie turns around, her ears remain a rounded shaped so they are constantly facing the screen, just like in Disney cartoons (the same rule applies to Mickey, who also has rounded ears when he appears at the end of the game, as in the cartoons). However, in Kingdom Hearts II (and all other games afterward), their ears stay in the same position whichever way they are facing (similar to how they appear in Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas). This is the reason why in Kingdom Hearts Queen Minnie can't be turned around like all the other characters when watched in full view in Jiminy's Journal.Family  Minnie is the granddaughter of Kate. She is also the daughter of Nessa and niece of Pearl. Tom has a wife named Spot, who is the mother of Melody and sister-in-law of Minnie. Also she is the cousin of Maggie. In Minnie and Maggie, Minnie's cousin Maggie appears. He found out and how he got the friendship with Daisy's son David. David is Daisy's son, while Maggie is Minnie's cousin.Personality  In addition to her sweetness and beauty, Minnie Mouse is very humble, regards herself as equal to her citizens, and displays very little hubris toward her status as queen. For example, she asks Aqua to address her simply as \"Minnie\". She cares very much for those dear to her, such as Mickey, Donald and Goofy, hoping for their safe return from their journey. Minnie also has little tolerance for evildoers, such as Pete and Maleficent, demanding to know what they are up to. The status of her kingdom also concerns her because of the Unversed and Heartless's appearances throught the years and causing chaos.Gallery  Kinect Disneyland Adventures: Minnie MouseQuotes  Minnie Mouse/Quotes and Lines.Videos  Voice Sounds: Minnie MouseDisney's House Of Mouse  Disney's House of Mouse is the sequel television series of House of Mouse.Characters Staff Guest Hercules:The Musical  Hercules:The Musical is a musical adaptation of Hercules.The musical features animatronic versions The statue of Zeus,The Hydra,The Cyclops,and The Titans created by Jim Henson's Creature Shop.Songs  Act I Act IIDifferences between The movie and The musical  \ufeffMalina's New Groove  Maline's New Groove (also known as\u00a0The Emperor's New Groove 3: Malina's New Groove) is an upcoming sequel to The Emperor's New Groove and Kronk's New Groove and is set after the events of The Emperor's New School.Cast  Jessica DiCicco - Empress Malina David Spade - Emperor Kuzco John Goodman - Pacha Wendie Malick - Chicha Candi Milo - Yzma Logan Grove -Tipo Grey DeLisle -Chaca Tara Strong -Yupi Mel Brooks - Pacha's father.TV Shows  The following category's features the Disney Fanon's TV Shows Canal Famille's House Of Mouse Disney Heroes The Series Disney Princess The Series Disney's Mickey Mouse Clubhouse Disney's Pinocchio: The Series Disney's The Little Mermaid: The Series Mickey Mouse and Friends Sing Me a Story with Princess Aurora Sonic Heroes: The Series Sonic The Hedgehog: Musical The Classic Stories of Winnie the Pooh The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh YoungstersDisney Fanon (channel)  Disney Fanon is a TV Channel that lanched on December 9th 2012.Programming  Disney Fanon will only air fanon shows.Dreams and Daydreams (aimed at five year olds and below) The Cool Block (aimed at six to twelve year olds) Dark Hours (aimed at thirteen year olds and above) Cheshire Cat.gif Female Character Images List of The Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny Adventures episodes  These are a list of episodes on The Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny Adventures.Season 4 (2014-2015)  A fourth season has been announced.

version 3 For editors: Here is a link to the Templates for you to use. TemplatesWelcome to the Pok\u00e9mon Vortex Wiki  This is the wiki for the online browser RPG, Pok\u00e9mon Vortex.Pokemon Vortex V3  Getting Started (To be added) Pokemon Vortex Gyms,Elite Four and Battle Frontier Side Quests Events Pokemon/Locations/Pokedex Pok\u00e9mart FAQs GlossarySide Quests  < Back To Main Page A new addition to pokemon vortex is sidequests. Sidequests comes as it's own side game of Vortex where you can battle through each region from various versions of the Pokemon games and Anime. There are 14 sets of sidequests in total which will eventually calculate to over 1212 battles to complete to win badges and prizes for your account. Sidequests works in a way, you can't re-battle an opponent to ensure people can't repeat prizes but this isn't fully the case. In the Options tab, you can reset your sidequests to redo them, this will set you right back to the very first battle of Kanto sidequests. (taken straight from main site)Kanto Sidequests  In Kanto, there are about 102 sidequests. Near the end of Kanto, you will encounter three trainers named\u00a0???,\u00a0???, and\u00a0???, which have Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres (in order), and they don't come right after one another, maybe every 5 battles one will show up. You can check your URL to see your sidequest number. Be ready with a team of six legendaries or pseudo legendaries.Johto Sidequests  As with Kanto Sidequests, there are about 100...I am typing as I battle along. At sidequest number 202 is a trainer also named\u00a0??? that has Raikou, Entei AND Suicune, all level 120. I am also lagging extremely, each attack taking a few minutes to load.. So, I'm back, and 2 battles after the first\u00a0??? is another\u00a0???. This\u00a0??? has just one Celebi, not hard.Sevii Islands Sidequests  At battle number 211 there is a\u00a0??? trainer (again, yes) with Moltres, Shiny Moltres and Dark Moltres.Events  < Back To Main Page The events page holds many NPCs to fight against, from Team Rocket to Team Plasma, and even Vortex Admins.

In the options tab you can choose whether you want to search through the maps during the day or night.\n (Please note the Pok\u00e9mon found are different during day and night)\n As expected, you will find things such as Murkrow and Hoothoot only at night.In-Game Clans  The biggest of v3's new features is the introduction of clans which was once just a forum based thing.\n You can now create a clan (providing you have met the requirements), join another person's clan and work as a team to be the best. Battle for your clan, collect Pok\u00e9mon for your clan and more.\n Clans have their own ranking leaderboard which is based on every member of that specific clan which will make a total point count. Things that effect the points are the same as a typical single account's points; Win count, experience, and members.New Pok\u00e9mon  A big change is that Ancient Pok\u00e9mon have been removed and replaced with the classic \"Metallic\" type. Along with these, a whole new type has been implemented called Shadow. Every Pok\u00e9mon can be obtained in Metallic and Shadow for you to add to your collection.\n What can Shadow type Pok\u00e9mon do? They are immunte to status effects.\n Not only have two new types been added but there is some of the new Pok\u00e9mon from your favourite Nintendo games. These Pok\u00e9mon include Mega evolutions and generation six Pok\u00e9mon from the Kalos region. These Pok\u00e9mon can be obtained in their respected ways in all six types; Normal, Shiny, Dark, Mystic, Metallic and Shadow.New Evolution Methods  Along with the new Pok\u00e9mon come the new evolution methods for existing Pok\u00e9mon and the new Pok\u00e9mon from the Kalos region.

Naturally, viewer discretion is advised. The 2D Prototype of Rayman 2 was initially intended to be a 2D game and would expand directly on the aesthetics and gameplay of Rayman. This version of the game was intended to be released for the Sega Saturn, Sony Playstation and Personal Computer. A playable level of this prototype is available in Rayman 2:The Great Escape for the Playstation 1. Read More Before you make a new article, please make sure it doesn't already exist!Rayman  Rayman is the main protagonist and title character\u00a0of the Rayman\u00a0series created by Ubisoft game designer Michel Ancel.Personality  Rayman has a friendly and carefree disposition, though his personality changes somewhat over the course of the games. In Rayman, he seems cheerful and child-like, having an innocent expression and pulling a\u00a0silly face as a means of defense. He does, however, show some fear when faced with bosses. In Rayman 2 he shows a more serious side, taking his mission seriously while remaining friendly. The Rayman 2 manual describes him as particularly lively with an intense love of life, indicating he might usually be more cheerful if the situation weren't as serious. In Rayman 3, he seems slightly more impatient, aloof and cocky, showing some exasperation with Murphy and Globox, though shows worry when Globox appears in danger and comforts him when sad. He is also much more prone to gloating over his victories, suggesting a vain streak. The Rayman 3 manual describes him as lazy; loving to sleep, mess around with friends and not take things seriously. It remarks that he doesn't really act like a big hero; though the Rayman 3 manual is characterised as having an opinion of it's own, this seems partially true. As of Rayman Origins, Rayman is an energetic, childish and fun-loving character that likes to beat up his enemies and spar with friends. It is also worth noting that when Rayman was created by Betilla in the first Origins trailer, he attempted to look up her skirt using his helicopter hair. This may show off a profligate or flirty side of him rarely seen.Appearance  Rayman is best known for his lack of limbs and neck, having a large head, hands and feet that are nonetheless connected to his body, as if by magic. He has a large, snout-like nose, wears white gloves, yellow skeakers and a red and purple hoodie with a white \"O\" shape on the front. In\u00a0Rayman\u00a0and\u00a0Rayman 2, he instead wore a purple shirt and a red scarf, still bearing his trademark symbol.Conception  Rayman was originally designed by Michel Ancel and was originally conceived as an avatar for a human boy character called Jimmy. In the Rayman prototype, the story goes that Jimmy created a virtual world on his computer called Hereitscool. When Hereitscool is nfected by a virus, Jimmy must enter his virtual world and take on the persona of Rayman in order to defeat the virus. Rayman was also originally designed with limbs. Technical difficulties led the developers to remove them to free up space.Roles Rayman  Rayman lives in The Valley with other limbless people, his journey starts when Betilla and The Magician call on Rayman to retreive The Great Protoon from Mr Dark, who has stolen it.Rayman 2  Rayman lives in The Glade of Dreams amongst limbed creatures, and curiously, he is said to be the only of his kind, with no-one knowing where he comes from. Rayman and the people of the Glade are captured by robotic space pirates and Rayman must escape in order to save his people. He goes on a quest to collect the four masks awaken Polokus to defeat Razorbeard.Rayman 3  Rayman sets out to defeat Andr\u00e9, a Dark Lum\u00a0who is attempting to take over the world with his army of hoodlums.Rabbids spinoffs  In Rayman Raving Rabbids, Rayman is captured by rabbids, a race of anthropomorphic, rabbit-like creatures who force him to participate in games for their entertainment. Rayman Raving Rabbids 2 curiously seems to be set on Earth, where Rayman attempts to infiltrate the rabbids' attempts to take over the world. In Rayman Raving Rabbids TV party, the Rabbids invade Rayman's home and force him to endure a week of their own television. At the end of Sunday, after a constantly interrupted football broadcast, Rayman snaps and destroys the television.Rayman Origins and Legends  Rayman and friends disturb the Land of The Livid dead with their snoring, and have to deal with the army of antitoons and monsters that are sent up from it's depths. As the game it becomes clear Ales Mansay/The Magician\u00a0is a follower of Mr Dark who wishes to overthrow Polokus. Supplementary material reveals that Rayman was created by Betilla. As of Rayman Legends, Rayman and his friends have been asleep for a hundred years, meanwhile, Polokus's nightmares have been multiplied. The heroes reawaken to combat the new threat.Cameo appearances  Rayman, along with Globox and Barbara, appears as a collectible trophy in Super Smash Bros. for Wii U. His appearance is a brand new 3D model created by Ubisoft for use in the game.Abilities  Rayman's main form of attack is his fists, which he can extend a long distance to attack enemies, this and his ability to use his hair as a helicopter were introduced in Rayman 1 and have been a staple since.\u00a0 In Rayman 1, Rayman has the ability to pull a silly face an incite frenzy into enemies. He can also use blue fairies to help him shrink. The exception to Rayman's fist ability is Rayman 2, where glowing balls of light were used intead. Rayman 3 introduces the concept of combat fatigues, Rayman uses magic washing detergeant to transform his clothes and use different abilities. Later in the game, Rayman gains the ability to pull a silly face and make black lums laugh, which turns them into red lums. Rayman Origins introduces the ability to run on walls, a power given to him by a nymph. The circle on Rayman's chest appears to be the source of Rayman's powers, it's through this which he gains powers from Betilla, or silver lums from Ly. This circle appears to serve as some sort of key that allows him to obtain the Masks of Polokus and appears in several places carved into stone, indicating it has importance in Rayman's world.Relationships  Rayman's best-known friendship is that with Globox. Globox was introduced in Rayman 2 as Rayman's best friend, and is described as his blood brother in the\u00a0Origins\u00a0reveal trailer. When Betilla first created Rayman from moonbeams, he used his helicopter hair to create a gust that blew up her skirt so he could see underneath it. This shows that Rayman is playful and flirtatious with Betilla despite being her 'son.' She also seems to return this affection in Origins, shaking her hips at him and winking before granting him the power to attack. (However all of the nymphs use this animation, so it could just be frame recycling.) Ly was shown to be in a romantic relationship with Rayman leading up to the release of Rayman 2, starring in \"the most romantic wallpaper ever seen\" on Rayman2.com, though the game itself doesn't show them in this way. It's questionable whether they were supposed to be in a romantic relationship in the final revision. In recent times, Rayman is shown to like sleeping and laying around with his friends Globox, Goth, Minimus and Barbara when not playing or teasing the denizens of the Land of the Livid Dead.Voice  In Rayman, he only spoke during the intro sequence or when he is immobile by saying phrases such as: \"Hey, you!\", \"I'm waiting!\", and \"Yo, dude!\". In Rayman 2: The Great Escape, Rayman spoke Wandaye, which consisted of some language that only his people can speak. The only English words he said were \"Hey!\" and \"Stop!\". Later versions added real-world languages, with the English voice being the most notable, provided by David Gasman. In Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc, Rayman spoke in real-world languages, with his English voice once again provided by Gasman. In Rayman Origins, Rayman's speech consisted of screams, yelps, and his catchphrase, while all the other characters spoke in Pig Latin. His voice in Origins\u00a0is much higher than in other games. In Rayman Legends, the voice clips from Emmanuel Garijo (Rayman's French voice actor) were recycled, and new English voice clips were recorded by Doug Rand. In the video \"I'm Looking for a Job!\", Rayman had a different voice. The voice actor is unknown. Rayman's first commercial, promoting the original\u00a0Rayman, was also dubbed into English, but the voice actor is also unknown.References Rayman Origins  Rayman Origins is a 2D platformer released in November 15, 2011 in North America and November 25, 2011 for Europe for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Wii and was released as well for the PlayStation Vita, Windows Vista computers and Nintendo 3DS a few months later. The Mac OS X version of the game was released by Feral Interactive on December 12th, 2013.Gameplay  The game is a 2D side-scrolling platformer, returning to gameplay similar to that of the first Rayman game. An option for multi-player co-op is available, which allows for up to four different players who can drop in and out. This was removed in the Vita version in place of bonus collectibles and Ghost Mode. The objective is to complete the levels, while freeing the Electoons and collecting Lums, in order to save the Glade of Dreams. Overall, there are over 60 levels in the game, taking place in 12 different environments. The player moves from the left side of the screen to the right side, fighting the enemies and collecting various objects along the way. Some levels have additional layers which can be explored. The sound and music play the important role in the gameplay as they're synchronized with player's actions. Similar to New Super Mario Bros. Wii, players who die during multi-player will turn into a balloon-like state and float around until popped by another player. However, one player must remain alive in order to progress, and the feature is unavailable in single player mode/Plot  Rayman, Globox, and two Teensies along with The Bubble Dreamer are sleeping at the Snoring Tree. The sounds of their snoring creates a musical melody similar to that of a rap song and unintentionally disturbs a granny from the Land of the Livid Dead. The granny screams at them, but eventually resorts to sending an army of monsters and Anti-Toons up to the surface. The monsters capture them and all of the Electoons. Rayman and Co. escape their cages, but now must save the Glade of Dreams from the monsters and save all the Electoons and the nymphs.Characters Playable Nymphs Others Bosses Worlds Collector's Edition  Along with Rayman Origins, you can get the Rayman Origins Collector's Edition Box that includes the following: This is only available for Sony PlayStation 3, Microsoft Xbox 360, and PC. Of course it's too late to get this collector's pack (unless it isn't), but you can go to Ebay or Amazon and get itExternal Links References Mr. Dark  Mr. Dark is the primary antagonist of the original Rayman where he steals the Great Protoon, scatters the Electoons across the world, and kidnaps Betilla the Fairy. This leads Rayman to track him down and fight him, rescuing the trapped Electoons along the way.Rayman 1  Mr. Dark is the main antagonist in this game and is the one who imprisons several of the Electoons, steals the Great Protoon and defeats Betilla the Fairy when she tries to stop him from taking it. This causes all of the Electoons that gravitated around it to lose their natural stability and scatter across the world, as well. As a result, strange creatures came to Rayman's world and started capturing all of the Electoons they could find. Rayman has to venture through five worlds, freeing Electoons and defeating Mr. Dark's minions, before he can fight Mr. Dark in his secret lair: Candy Chateau. To stop Rayman from reaching his lair, he creates Rayman's evil clone, Bad Rayman, and puts Rayman under several curses that affect his controls. Once confronted, Mr. Dark easily corners Rayman by disabling his fists and attacking him with fire magic. However, a group of electoons come to Rayman's aid with a new fist powerup. This causes Mr. Dark to apparently flee. He then creates hybrids of boss enemies that were previously fought; the first of which is a hybrid of Mr. Skops and Mr. Stone; the second is a Space Mama and Moskito hybrid. Finally, Rayman fights a Moskito, Mr. Sax and Space Mama triple hybrid. All of these enemies have 8 health each. Once all three bosses are defeated, Mr. Dark seemingly vanishes from the face of the earth.Rayman Brain Games  In Rayman Brain Games (PS1), Mr. Dark returned to steal the Book of Knowledge. Betilla the Fairy and The Magician turned to Rayman to find it. Rayman has to go through 6 different gates to find it. Along the way he will learn how to do reading, writing phonics, etc. Mr. Dark also appears in Candy Chateau in Rayman Gold, Designer, and By His Fans.Rayman 1 (GBC)  There is no mention of him stealing the Great Protoon, instead capturing all the Electoons and taking their energy for himself to use. Rayman had to venture through 7 lands before he can defeat the evil Mr. Dark and free the Electoons. He is encountered in the fifth part of the final area of the game, the Arcane Forest. Mr. Dark uses fire, lightning and dark orbs to attack Rayman.  When Rayman defeats him, he burns up, and his spirit releases from his cloak, withers away and seems to explode. The electoons use his remaining cloak to play a prank on Rayman afterwards.Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc  Mr. Dark has a very subtle cameo appearance in Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc. In the 2D Madness mini-game, after you complete the level, you will arrive in a house. There are several pictures from Rayman shown and one of them contains Mr. Dark. This is Mr. Dark's only appearance in a 3D game so far.Rayman Origins  Though Mr. Dark did not appear, his influence was felt throughout the game. It was thought he was the main antagonist and the mastermind behind the Moody Clouds. In the majority of the adventure, the Magician tricks Rayman and his buddies into giving him lums to power his machines. At The Reveal, the Magician showed his true alignment as a follower who tried to usurp Mr. Dark's position, having renounced the \"good\" star on his hat and attempting to dispose of the heroes with two robotic bosses. Rayman and his buddies defeated both of them and pursue the Magician, who uses disco to distract the heroes as he makes a get away in his blimp. The heroes fight the blimp only making it fall into the core of the fortress, causing it to explode and seemingly destroying him. While it was initially thought that the Magician and Mr. Dark were meant to be the same character in this appearance, the writer of the game, Gabrielle Shrager, has clarified that the Magician is not Mr. Dark; rather, a fan and a usurper. Outside of that occurrence, the only time Mr. Dark is mentioned is if Raymesis speaks to the Bubble Dreamer. The Bubble Dreamer makes fun of his ugliness, and blames that on Mr. Dark. It is unknown whether he was joking or confused him with Bad Rayman, though it may be possible that Mr. Dark had some involvement in the appearance of RaymesisRayman Legends  His legacy is still felt a century later through the Dark Teensies, thoug he himself is still absent.Trivia Appearances Betilla  Betilla, also known as the Great Fairy, is the oldest member of the nymph sisterhood. Her appearances throughout the Rayman series vary considerably. However, in all reiterations to date, she possesses long, red, flowing hair, dons a peaked mage-like hat, and is responsible for bestowing powers upon Rayman. Herself and the other nymphs in Rayman Legends were absent because they became liquidated.History Rayman  In Rayman, her original duty was protector and purveyor of the Great Protoon Orb and the balance it maintained throughout the Rayman Universe. This balance was disrupted when the evil Mr. Dark entrapped the electoons (source of power for the Great Protoon Orb and several beings and creatures), diminishing the once great magical abilities of Betilla, consequentially defeating her and stealing the Great Protoon Orb. Betilla in her weakened state is encountered early in the game and initially grants Rayman the ability to punch by launching his disjointed fist. Progression through the game will enable similar encounters with an ever-increasing healthy and encouraging Betilla, who bestows further powers to our hero Rayman, including but not limited to: the ability to swing off special flying \"O\" ring creatures, temporary flight using helicopter-hair, etc. Betilla's first appearance in Rayman, has her depicted as a wingless fairy, and like Rayman and other Raypeople particularly within this Rayman universe is limbless. Her hands are covered in white gloves and her shoes (or boots) are yellow and partially green in colouration, not too dissimilar from Rayman's appearance. Her body appears to be comprised of a formless two-toned, green-yellow, floating cloak, adorned with blue stars and a tapered neck. Her lips are a shade of purple-pink and her eyes are similar to that of other Raypeople. Her hair is free-flowing and approx. two thirds her body length. Her headwear is a horn-shaped, flute-like hat, with a peaked top, similarly coloured and patterned to match the rest of her ensemble.Rayman Origins  Betilla, being a member of the sisterhood of nymphs, utilized and collated the power of \"the magnificent moon beams of the second Summer solstice\" to conjure and create the fabled hero \"destined to preserve the equilibrium of the sacred universe. The one we call Rayman\". During the events of Rayman Origins she is captured by evil minions and imprisoned, as with her sister nymphs, in the jaws of enemy cages that endeavor to flee from suspected heroes who would seek to free their captive prey. Once freed from the confines of her captives Betilla grants Rayman and his companions the \"power to attack\", bestowing the ability to punch, slap, or manifest forward thrust (pelvic thrusting), to Rayman, Globox and Teensies, respectively. In Origins, Betilla, as well as the other nymphs, contrastingly possess connective limbs and appendages compared to Betilla as she appeared in Rayman 1. Her appearance matches the cartoonish styling of the Rayman Origins universe, and ties in with the formulaic styling of the sisterhood of nymphs. Similarly to her fellow kin, Betilla the nymph has a curvaceous figure, accentuated cleavage, hips and thighs and semi-transparent fore-wings similar to that of a dragonfly (without the hind wings) that permit her to hover, fly and perform aerodynamic manoeuvres. She adorns a strapless two-toned green bikini top, an alternated-matching miniskirt and matching thigh-high leggings and a peaked mage-styled hat that is cocked to the left (looking straight on) in most of her appearances. Her hair is a deep red and lighter red (on her hair shine) that sweeps and curls for the entire length and a quarter of her total body length (hat excluding). On each of her wrists she has a set of lose fitting golden bangles that slightly slide the length of her forearm, she also has 3 tiny, brown-ish freckles on both cheeks. Betilla is the first encountered nymph of the sisterhood, and is freed from captive enemies in the Jibberish Jungle. It is speculated that this is the domain she resides in and protects; as with her sisters whom are encountered across the various other realms in the Rayman Origins Universe.Trivia Rayman 2: The Great Escape  Rayman 2: The Great Escape is a platformer video game and the second installment in the Rayman series, it debuted on the 29th October 1999, on the Nintendo 64 and PC. Rayman 2 was also released on the Dreamcast, Playstation and Playstation 2 in 2000, being adapted for Playstation 2 as Rayman Revolution, Game Boy Color as Rayman 2 Forever. Nintendo DS as Rayman DS, and to Nintendo 3DS as Rayman 3D. It was very well recieved by Metacritic and Gamerankings . and featured on IGN's and Gamespot's and \"Best Games of all time\" listsPlot Setting  Razorbeard and his robopirates invade The Glade of Dreams, destroy the Heart of The World into 1000 lums and enslave the inhabitants of the planet. With the aid of his friend Globox, Rayman escapes his enslavement by the pirates and learns that he must unite the 4 magical masks in order awaken the creator of the world, Polokus, who went into a mystical sleep long ago.Story  Rayman 2 takes place in a world called the Glade of Dreams. An army of Robot Pirates, led by Admiral Razorbeard, invades this world and destroys the Heart of the World, the world core. This greatly weakens the resistance's power and disables Rayman's powers, leading to his capture. Globox, a friend of Rayman, is later also captured and put in the same cell as Rayman aboard the Pirates' prison ship. Globox gives Rayman a silver lum given to him by Ly the fairy, which restores his powers. Rayman escapes the prison ship, and is separated from Globox again. He learns that to stand a chance against the Pirates, he needs to find four ancient magic masks to awaken Polokus, the spirit of the world, hidden in secret and mysterious sanctuaries consisting of the four elements water/ice, earth/stone, fire, and air. He travels through the Glade of Dreams via the Hall of Doors, a magical place linked to various locations in the world, controlled by the ancient Teensies. In the course of the game, Rayman frees Globox who had been captured again, and they continue together for a short while until Globox departs again to go find his family. Later, Rayman finds Globox's wife Uglette and learns that he has been imprisoned on the Prison Ship. Rayman also encounters his friend Clark, a strongman who has stomach problems due to eating rusty pirates; to continue through the level, Rayman has to cure Clark by means of an elixir. Eventually, Rayman recovers the four masks and awakens Polokus, who makes quick work of the pirates on land. In the air however, he has no power, and Rayman is tasked to dispose of the Pirates' flying Prison Ship, where Admiral Razorbeard also has his headquarters. In a final battle Rayman fights Razorbeard, who is controlling a giant robot, the Grolgoth. Eventually Rayman destroys the robot and while Razorbeard escapes in a small escape pod, the Prison Ship explodes. Rayman is presumed dead and only one of his shoes is found, but during his funeral, he appears again, walking on a crutch.Characters  In the PSOne version of the game, the creatures Rayman frees from the cages are split into three different races, the manual refers to them along with Polokus, The Teensies and Ly as \"The Magical Beings\":Bosses Mask Guardians Levels  In addition, there are two bonus levels, the walk of life and the walk of power, accessed by the Bayou and the Sanctuary of Rock and Lava respectively. They give a reward for finishing them a health replenish and three golden fists respectively. Globox's Village This level is only for the Sega Dreamcast version. When you're at the Woods Of Light you can access it. It is full of floating platforms. PS1 Version's LevelsGameplay  The game is played from a third-person perspective and the player has control over the camera, though in some situations this control is limited to only certain angles. At several points in the game the player loses control during cut scenes, which typically show dialogue between characters. The gameplay is also interrupted by a cut scene taking place in Admiral Razorbeard's room aboard the prison ship several times. During these scenes, Rayman is not present. By collecting lums, the player unlocks more information about the game world and its back story, which can be read by standing still and pressing a specific button for some time. Some back story is also obtained through (optional) instructions from Murfy, a \"flying encyclopedia\" who provides explanations on all kinds of gameplay elements. In contrast to its predecessor, which was a 2D platformer, Rayman 2 is a 3D platformer. The player navigates through a mostly linear sequence of levels, fighting enemy Robo-Pirates, solving puzzles and collecting lums. Collecting enough lums gains the player access to new parts of the world. Part of the lums are hidden in small cages, in which other freedom fighters or Teensies are imprisoned, and can be obtained by breaking the cages. Rayman starts the game with minimal abilities, and he can gain more abilities as the game progresses. The main weapon available in the game is Rayman's fist, with which energy orbs can be shot. Eventually, the orbs can be charged before shooting them, making them more powerful. Rayman can also enter a strafing stance which allows him to easily aim orbs whilst avoiding enemy attacks. Rayman later gains the ability to swing over large gaps using Purple Lums. Rayman is also able to use his helicopter hair to slow his descent while jumping, with some segments later in the game allowing him to fly with his hair. There are also various items Rayman can use throughout the game, such as explosive barrels he can throw, giant plums he can ride on to carry him across dangerous surfaces, and rockets he must ride on to access new areas. In addition to the main, story-based level sequence, there are also several levels in which the player can gain bonuses in a time trial. Additionally, by collecting all lums and breaking all cages in a level, the player unlocks a bonus level in which one of Globox's children races against a robot pirate. When the player controlling the child wins the race, Rayman gains health or a powerup.Development  Main article: Rayman 2 2D Prototype Rayman 2 was initially intended to be a 2D game and would expand directly on the aesthetics and gameplay of Rayman. This version of the game was intended to be realeased for the Sega Saturn and Sony Playstation. A playable level level of this prototype is available in Rayman 2:The Great Escape for the Playstation 1.Versions  Rayman 2 was released on a wide variety of platforms, with several differences and name changes between the versions.N64 and PC  The Nintendo 64 version of Rayman 2: The Great Escape was released first, followed by a PC release later that year, with slight improvements to the PC version (including graphics and music). The PC version is compatible with computers ranging from around the year of 1999 to the present day, although the game's 16-bit DRM software has difficulty interacting with newer Windows operating systems that run in 32- or 64-bit environments. On 26 May 2011, GOG.com re-released Rayman 2: The Great Escape, alongside Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc and Rayman Forever, made to be compatible with Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Windows 7, along with a digital version of the game's soundtrack as bonus content. On 26 January 2012 Ubisoft announced that Rayman 2 would be added as a bonus for preordering the PC version of Rayman Origins.Dreamcast  The Dreamcast version has various changes from the original Nintendo 64 and PC versions, including several 2D sprites being replaced by 3D models, and a slightly zoomed-out camera angle. The Dreamcast version also has exclusive mini-games, playable by finding hidden crystals, and changes to the world map (the Dreamcast version uses The Isle of Doors instead of The Hall of Doors as the world map) and final battle. Many features in the Dreamcast version are retained in Rayman Revolution, such as the camera angle and the 3D models. This version has received the highest average reviews, winning 'IGN Dreamcast Game of the Year 2000', and a 9.6 score from IGN.PlayStation  The PlayStation version was developed by Ubisoft Shanghai, and is the first version to have the characters speaking real languages (English, French, German, Spanish and Italian), replacing the gibberish spoken by the characters originally. Numerous level design changes were made, and some levels were removed altogether. There are only 800 Yellow Lums in this version and the number remains the same all through the game (the scene with Razorbeard eating one of the Yellow Lums was changed so that he would eat a Red one instead). Some exclusive characters are present in this version, and characters that did not have speaking roles in the other versions, such as the guardians Axel, Umber, and Foutch, now speak to Rayman when he confronts them. Additionally, this version features an exclusive mini-game for players who collect 90% of the Yellow Lums (which is actually a 2D prototype of Rayman 2). This port was later released on the PlayStation Network on 18 December 2008 in North America and on 28 July 2010 in Europe.PlayStation 2  This version, titled Rayman: Revolution (Rayman 2: Revolution in North America), was released on December 22, 2000. It features many enhancements including new minigames, level revisions, new music tracks, three new bosses, and Yellow Lum redistribution. The Hall of Doors was replaced with three central hubs in which to walk freely, along with the ability to purchase upgrades and minigames with the Yellow Lums they have. The game can also be saved when a level has been only partially completed, but like all versions of the game, it still uses manual saves. However, the frame rate is not as smooth as the near-constant 60fps of the Sega Dreamcast version. This is the only version in which the 1,000th Yellow Lum can be obtained normally, and hence actually changes the total back to 1,000 despite Razorbeard still eating it. The 1,000th Lum is obtained after beating Clark and receiving the Lumz Radar, an exclusive gadget that helps track down any missed Yellow Lums. English and other voices also return, but they are optional this time, so you can choose between the gibberish present in most versions of the game or the real languages. This port was later released on the PlayStation Network on May 1, 2012 in North America.Game Boy Color  Titled Rayman 2 Forever (Rayman 2 in North America), this version is a 2D side scroller, and follows the story of the other versions. It was released in June 2001 in North America and December 2001 in Europe. It has two identical boss fights. The second boss is Razorbeard, even though the sprite for a common Robo Pirate is used. Ly and Globox appear only in cutscenes. Like the PS1 version, Rayman has to collect 800 Lums instead of 1000.Nintendo DS  The Nintendo 64 version of game was ported to the Nintendo DS under the title Rayman DS on March 24, 2005. Very few changes have been made to the game from the Nintendo 64 version. Parts of some music tracks have been taken out and some graphical textures have been simplified, both likely due to storage limits on the Nintendo DS cartridge. The port also added touch screen controls.iOS  Using the engine of Rayman 2 for the Dreamcast, another port was released for Apple's iOS-based portable devices on 1 March 2010. It features landscape touch-screen controls, with a figurative analogue stick on the left and two on-screen \"buttons\" on the right-hand side of the screen.Nintendo 3DS  At a Nintendo event held in Europe on 19 January 2011, Ubisoft revealed several titles in development for Nintendo 3DS, which included a port of Rayman 2 titled Rayman 3D to be released at the system's launch. Ubisoft confirmed that this version is a port of the Dreamcast version (and like the iOS version, the 3DS one also has no minigames nor the Globox Village) with \"major updates on key game play elements such as accessibility, progression and learning curve.\" With this release, versions of Rayman 2 have been launch titles for two Nintendo handheld consoles.Reception  Rayman 2 was received very well by critics and fans alike. It was lauded in most aspects: gameplay, audio, graphics and controls alike. Reviews praised the colorful, vibrant world and the varied soundtrack and varied gameplay. \u00a0 It is still hailed as one of the greatest games of all time. The reception for the Nintendo DS version (dubbed \"Rayman DS\") was mixed, citing graphical flaws and camera problems. While it did support controlling the game via the touchpad, this was regarded as sloppy and awkward. These problems were partly caused by the game being a direct port of the Nintendo 64 version of the original.Trivia External links References Globox  Globox is Rayman's slap-happy best friend, who sticks by him in many of his adventures. He is from a species called Glutes, and is frightened by many things that happen to him during the game. Globox is a kind being with blue skin and a wide, frog-like mouth. He is the sidekick of Rayman and has a rather crazy attitude and personality. He is voiced by John Leguizamo.Rayman 2: The Great Escape  Globox makes his first appearance in Rayman 2. At the beginning of the game, Globox is trapped in a Robo-Pirate cell along with Rayman, where he gives Rayman a Silver Lum that was given to Globox by Ly. The Silver Lum gives Rayman back his ability to throw his fists, an ability that he then uses to break himself and Globox out of their cell. Later on in the game, Globox gets captured by robo-pirates, and Rayman frees him, then Globox helps Rayman through the rest of the level by doing a rain dance, summoning rain clouds. Also on that level, Globox gives Rayman another Silver Lum, giving Rayman the ability to charge up energy in his fists, making the unleashed punch farther ranged and more damaging. Near the end of the game, Globox gets captured again, this time by Razorbeard, who uses him as bait to lure Rayman to his ship. Rayman defeats Razorbeard and destroys his ship, and Globox somehow survives the ships destruction. He is then seen in the last cutscene, along with many other characters, mourning Rayman's death as Rayman returns. Throughout the game, his wife and many kids are also seen. The player can read about how Globox was created by Polokus for amusement in a special area after getting enough Yellow Lums.Rayman Arena  Globox plays a minor role in Rayman Arena as one of the racer/fighters. When he floats, he will swell up, similar to how he would in Hoodlum Havoc. He had many alternate costumes, including a watermelon skin, a gigantic cherry costume, and even a Rayman outfit.Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc  Globox appears at the beginning of Hoodlum Havoc trying to save a sleeping Rayman who is being hunted by Andre. While Globox was trying to pull Rayman up a tree, Rayman's head, feet, and torso fell to the ground, while Rayman's hands remained in his hands. Globox then fled and hid in an empty barrel, where Rayman soon found him and got back his hands. Not too long later, Andre (in his blacklum form) accidentally goes down a screaming Globox's mouth. For most of the game, Andre is in Globox's body, while Rayman tries to find a doctor that can take Andre out of Globox. Hoodlums try to kill Rayman so that they can capture Globox and brutally purge Andre from Globox's body (presumably without much care towards Globox's own health). Andre also forces Globox to nourish him with Plum Juice, which he loves, but Globox is allergic to. The allergic reactions cause Globox to: Globox does not perform the rain dance in Hoodhum Havoc nor does his family make an appearance in the game.Rayman: Hoodlum's Revenge  This is the first platformer in which Globox is a playable character. He is usually used for turning on switches so Rayman could get to certain places. He still drinks plum juice, which causes him to have allergic reactions. (however they are not quite as bad as in Rayman 3)Rayman Raving Rabbids  Although Globox does not appear in the console version of this game, his local kids appear in the game, who have been kidnapped by the Rabbids. Rayman's main focuses are to escape and to save the Globox kids, who have also had a slight makeover. He does, however, appear in the GBA version, in the first level, along with the Teensies, considering you choose to rescue them.Rayman Raving Rabbids 2  While Globox again does not physically appear in this game, his name can be seen on the leaderboards for minigames, along with other characters from the Rayman series, including Murfy.Rayman Origins  In Rayman Origins, Globox is a selectable character. Globox also has two costumes, those being Red Globox\u00a0and Glombrox. Rayman\u00a0and the Teensies have costumes that change their color schemes to the pattern on Globox's skin color, those being Raybox and GlobTeen.Rayman Legends  In Rayman Legends, Globox fights alongside Rayman as a multiplayer character, and an alternate costume for single players, much like how he had appeared in the last game. Globox also has numerous costumes for players to choose from, much more than in the last game.Trivia Reference List Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc  Rayman 3 intro Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc is the third major platforming installment in the Rayman series. It tells the story of how Rayman stops Andre, an evil black lum, from taking over the world with his army of sack-like 'Hoodlum' soldiers. The game has sarcastic self-referential undertones and pokes fun at the platforming video game genre. It was released in early 2003 for various gaming platforms, such as the PlayStation 2, Nintendo Gamecube and the Xbox. In 2004 it was released for the Mac OS X. It has a sequel by the name of Rayman: Hoodlum's Revenge, which was released in 2005 for the Game Boy Advance. On the console versions, Groove Armada - Madder is the official theme song of the game. It was released later for the\u00a0latest consoles as Rayman 3 HD, available on PSN (PlayStation Network) and Xbox Live Arcade. \u00a0Plot  Andre, the leader of the Black Lums, is a lum who was supposively said to have grown out of pure evil. One night, as he is passing through the Crossroad of Dreams, he transforms other Red Lums into Black Lums to join him. The group eventually gains enough hair from various animals throughout the forest to dress up to disguise themselves as Hoodlums. In the middle of the process, Murfy, one of the residents and workers of the Fairy Council, discovers them. Andre later on discovers him hiding nearby and begins to make chase of him. Murfy is eventually chased to a small clearing, where Rayman and his friend Globox are sound asleep. Just as Murfy reaches them, Globox is awakened by the commotion. Now aware of the situation, Globox helps Murfy try to get Rayman, who is still unawakened by the events, to safety. In the process, Globox accidentally removes Rayman's hands, forcing Murfy to pick Rayman up by his hair and drag him away from the clearing\u00a0 himself. In an attempt to save himself, Globox runs away to safety taking Rayman's hands along with him. As time passes, more and more Hoodlums are invading the forest. After reaching the entrance to the Fairy Council, Rayman and Murfy discover Globox hiding in a barrel. Just as Rayman gets his hands back from his rather cowardly friend, Andre and a few of his Hoodlum minions join them, giving chase to a much frightened Globox. As Rayman and Murfy pursue after then, they learn of Andre's evil plan: to taint the Heart of the World so that he can create that same energy into an army of Hoodlums. Undeterred, the twosome continue the chase after the evil flyin bully. Eventually, Andre catches up with Globox, who ends up accidentally swallowing the evil creature. Now it is up to Rayman to find a doctor to rid Andre from Globox's stomach. Along the way, Rayman meets up with three doctors: Otto, Romeo, and Art Rytus (or Gonzo). As all three doctors fail independently to purge Andre, they succeed in getting rid of him after some teamwork. Now angry and still undeterred by his plans for world domination, Andre teams up with Reflux, a being whom Rayman had to duel with to prove his worth to the Knaaren race. Hungry for power and desperate to get rid of Rayman, the two decide to team up and make even more havoc for Rayman. Reflux and turning Andre back into a Red Lum. Shortly thereafter, Rayman and Globox return back to the clearing that they were in at the very beginning. Globoxsharing his sorrow with Rayman about Andre's return to. Rayman tries to console him by saying that he thinks that there is really no way to bring Andre back. Globox then shares that, unlike making a Black Lum turn baco a red one by making it laugh, you can turn a red lum into a Black one by getting it scared. At a loss for what would truly scare a lum, Rayman and Globox fall asleep. In a flashback scene to follow, it is revealed that Rayman's hands are the \"true enemy\" of the game, as they detach from Rayman while he's asleep and run off to go scare a nearby Red Lum. The scared lum happens to turn into Andre, which brings the scene back to the proposed beginning of the game.Levels Special Creatures  Throughout the game, Rayman can also find two types of creatures, blue lizard-like creatures called Matuvus an red flower-shaped creatures called Tribelles. Points are given when Rayman looks at the Matuvus with the first person view, and when he slowly approaches a Tribelle.Voice Cast Reception  In general, the game has been received positively [1]. Overall, the game has been praised for its graphics and sound quality, but is more hit-or-miss on the gameplay and sound style. IGN lauds the game for the voice-acting, calling it \"exactly what the Rayman franchise has been begging for,\"[2] whereas GameSpot notes that the dialogue for the game is \"trying too hard to be self-aware and hip.\"[3] Reviews also note that the gameplay sets into what can become an obvious pattern. The game has also been criticised for the character's and game world's sudden and highly unexpected personality change, which made the game less appealing to fans of the previous Rayman games. These are a few of the scores that were issued for Hoodlum Havoc:[4]Other versions Rayman 3 (GBA) Plot  The game starts with Globox accidentally swallowing a Black Lum when trying to save the Teensies. As soon as Rayman finds out about this, he scolds his friend and decides that they should find a way to remove the Black Lum, however, Globox simply runs away, forcing Rayman to go after him. Meanwhile, on board the pirate prison ship \"The Buccaneer\", Admiral Razorbeard, the leader of the Robo-Pirates, decides to steal the lum and use his power to his advantage. During his search for Globox, Rayman encounters many other friends from his previous adventure, including Murfy, who gives him advice during the game, and Ly the Fairy, who gives him new powers. The game ends with Rayman confronting Razorbeard and his weapon, the Grolgoth, in a battle similar to that found at the end of Rayman 2: The Great Escape. Rayman manages to defeat him, and Globox, now cured, brags to his children that he was the one who saved the day with just a little help from Rayman.Sequel  A direct sequel entitled Rayman: Hoodlum's Revenge was released shortly thereafter exclusively on the Gameboy Advance. Andre returns and his army of Hoodlums attempt to clone Reflux.Rayman 3 HD  Rayman 3 HD is a port of Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc in HD, released only for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.Rayman (Video Game) Raymans Evil Copy-Cat  Throughout the series, Rayman, like many video game characters, has had several evil doppelg\u00e4ngers of himself. Bad Rayman: an evil clone of Rayman created by Mr. Dark. Raymesis: a Rayperson that dresses like Rayman in order to tarnish his reputation.Teensies  The Teensies, singular teensy, are a race of short, long-nosed beings that often help out Rayman on his adventures. They seem to have many Kings and Queens such as\u00a0Grand Minimus, Teensy Queen, and The First King. In Rayman 2, teensies are described as old, wise and absent-minded, though young teensies have appeared since then. Teensies are quite musical people. The Rayman 2 manual describes them as loving to dance, while the Hoodlum's Revenge manual describes them as usually partying. Their magic is also music and dance related, using dance to open portals. A teensie also uses music and dance to hypnotize Rayman and his friends. They have been shown in Rayman Origins and Rayman Legends to be able to use offensive magic. However, it is unknown if all Teensies can do so. According to the Rayman Origins official website, a teensy's large nose gives them an extremly keen ability to smell magic, as well as a tendancy to snore.Appearance  Teensies are very short in comparison to the other inhabitants of Polokus's world, about half the height of the other creatures. They have cyan skin and very large noses that hide their mouths. Their arms end in fingerless mitten-like hands while their legs are very short and small. Until Rayman Origins, the Teensies take on a whole new appearance. Their eyes have changed, one big and one small. They have multiple costumes to unlock in Rayman Origins, and have longer noses as use of Schnozz-ballads in the opening cutscene of the 3DS, PS3, Wii and Xbox 360 versions of Rayman Origins.Habitat  Many teensies reside at the Heart of the World, usually partying to disco music. In Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc it is revealed that there are many different kinds of teensies living around the world.Rayman 2: The Great Escape  The Teensies made their debut in Rayman 2. Four of them are rescued by Rayman at the end of the first level, and helped Rayman by opening up for him the Hall of Doors, which allows anyone to access different parts of the universe with just a few footsteps. They are also constantly fighting over the title of \"King Teensie\".Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc  In Rayman 3, The Teensies take on a whole new image. Some of them are seen as mountain climbers, called Tufkins, some as shepherds, called Sylkins, some as ghosts, known as Griskins, and even some as Native Americans called Nookins. When Rayman and Globox make their way to the Heart of the World (which Andr\u00e9 is trying to destroy), the Teensies are there waiting for them. During the rest of the story, they are trapped in many cages, which Rayman must free them from to earn pickups and more health. A Teensie is seen dancing during the credits. Whenever one is freed from a cage, he or she makes some random excuse to leave, such as \"I have to go invent chocolate toothpaste\" or \"I have to go give my auntie a spongebath\". They often say very humorous or strange things; one Ghost Teensie in the Land of the Livid Dead stating that he has to \"walk his flowers and water his dog\".Rayman Arena  Two Teensies are a playable characters in Rayman M/Arena. They are voiced by Cindy Lee Delong and Ken Starcevic and when they win a race or battle they fight each other.Rayman Origins  Teensies are playable characters in Rayman Origins. In addition to two starting costumes, the player can unlock additional ones for a certain amount of Electoons. Here and in its sequel, the singular version of \"Teensies\" is \"Teensy\".Rayman Legends  In Rayman Legends, you free imprisoned Teensies as the main objective, replacing the Electoons\u00a0from Rayman Origins. There are either 3 or 10 in each level, totaling up to 700 Teensies. There are King Teensies and Queen Teensies (one of each in all levels), normal Teensies (8 in total for most levels), and Jester Teensies, which appear with the King and Queen Teensies during stages offering only 3 Teensies. A few Teensies can also be collected from Lucky Tickets. The main conflict of the game is The Magician\u00a0managing to become 5 Dark Teensies when the nightmares began to multiply and diversify. At the end of the boss fights, players can send the Dark Teensies into a moon in a flying pig constellation, where they are punished by imp-like aliens to be their instruments with their tridents. Like in\u00a0Rayman Origins, the singular variation of \"Teensies\" is spelled \"Teensy\"Trivia References Rabbid  Raving Rabbids, formerly called \"Bunnies\" in the games, are enemies of Rayman.Appearance  The Rabbids commontly are short, with white skin, large ears and teeth. The Rabbids' eyes are normally blue when they are in a normal mood. However,\u00a0when they go berserk over something, their eyes turn red, they pull out an item (usually a plunger) and scream \"BWAAAAAHHHH!!!!!!\"Rayman Raving Rabbids  In Rayman Raving Rabbids they began appearing out of the ground and quickly took over Rayman's world, kidnapping him and the Baby Globoxes, apparently because other species made fun of them. They forced Rayman to compete in various gladiatorial events (namely odd minigames), and rewarded him only with plungers. Rayman eventually used all the plungers he got from them to build a ladder to freedom, but after escaping realized the Rabbids still had the baby Globoxes and he would no longer be around to protect them from the games they made him go through, so he turned around and jumped into one of the Rabbid hole to go back for them, only to get his foot stuck in it. Later games seem to only be focused on the Rabbids rather than Rayman for some reason, revolving around the minigames, Rayman appears to have his own games now as the Rabbids do as well. when they have mouth contact with Xbox 360's Kinect.List of Games Black Lums  Black Lums are actually Red Lums who have been enraged or frightened, and filled with hate. Andre was the first Black Lum, 'The Lord of the Black Lums'. Andre then went around, changing other red Lums into Black Lums. He quickly assembled an entire swarm of black lums before committing various offences, as shaving animal's fur, and attacking innocent creatures. When enough Black lums are in a swarm, they can form a Hoodlum. Hoodlums are humanoid, and their actual form is hidden behind cloth, gloves, and ten gallon hats. Hoodlums carry gun like weapons that shoot out fireballs. When Rayman defeats a Hoodlum, a Black Lum will be seen flying away. Some Hoodlums also have dollar signs floating above their heads. This symbolizes that they are carrying a special powerup which Rayman can use to temporarily gain new powers. Later on in the game, Rayman gains the abilitiy to make silly faces. When Black Lums sees this, they will laugh, and change back into a red Lum. They are usually characterized as dumb, with jokes about them seen on the pause menu, saying things such as: SPECIAL NEWS-FLASH: A Hoodlum has just succeeded counting up to four. In Rayman 3 (Gameboy Advance), Ly states that Black Lums like places where it's warm, damp, and humid; for example, swamps,. They also seem to like fermented Plum Juice. It is possible that\u00a0Blacklums are\u00a0all male as Andre refers to them as his \"brothers\".Appearance  Black Lums appear similar to other lums, instead of resembling balls of energy, they appear to be balls of black fur. They are evil lums created by scaring red lums. Making a Black Lum laugh turns it back into a red lum.Hoodlum types  In Hoodlum Havoc, there are a few different types of Hoodlums. The types are listed below. Most hoodlums resemble cowboys, rednecks, or scarecrows, due to masks they wear.Trivia Admiral Razorbeard  The pirate leader, he is famous throughout the galaxy for reducing over 100 peaceful planets to cosmic dust. Don't be fooled by his pathetic and silly appearance \u2013 his ferocity is unmatched. His dream? Overrun Rayman's world and reduce all its inhabitants to slavery. \u2014Manual, Rayman 2: The Great Escape. The Admiral Razorbeard is a spacefaring robotic pirate, and the main antagonist of Rayman 2: The Great Escape and its remakes. From his flying ship, the Buccaneer, he commands the Robo-Pirate fleet which seeks to enslave the inhabitants of the Glade of Dreams. Admiral Razorbeard makes substantial appearances in Rayman M and the handheld version of Rayman 3, as well as minor appearances in Rayman 3, The Animated Series and Rayman Kart. Early in the development of Rayman 2, Razorbeard was known as Razor Face.Description  Admiral Razorbeard is the leader of the Robo-Pirate army, which invades the Glade of Dreams and captures most of the world's inhabitants to use as slaves. He is a short robot with a peg-leg, wearing a huge Admiral's hat and striped red-and-white trousers, and his face sports the large, crooked metal beard from which his name is derived. In Hands Down! it is mentioned that his beard is made of steel. Admiral Razorbeard is infamous throughout the universe for invading and conquering over one hundred peaceful planets and reducing their inhabitants to slavery; these planets were left as nothing more than interstellar dust, and it is unknown what fate the slaves suffered. In Rayman 2: The Great Escape, Razorbeard and his Robo-Pirate army invade Rayman's world, the Glade of Dreams. In Rayman: The Animated Series, however, Razorbeard works at a circus, as a mere servant to the Ringmaster, Rigatoni; this starkly contrasts with his role in the games, and it is unclear whether the events of the animated series are part of the game series's continuity. In Rayman M, it was revealed that Razorbeard has a wife, aptly named Razorwife, who can be unlocked as a playable character in the game. According to the manual for Rayman Arena, Razorbeard has a mother, who detests Razorwife and blames her for her son's failure in his evil career.Role in the games Rayman 2: The Great Escape  Admiral Razorbeard makes his debut in Rayman 2: The Great Escape, where he is the main villain and the commander of the invading Robo-Pirate army. Prior to the game's opening, Razorbeard and a group of Robo-Pirates arrive in a Warship to raid the Glade of Dreams. In a memorable battle, Rayman and Ly the Fairy defeat the pirates on board, who flee in an escape capsule. Razorbeard is enraged by this defeat; he and his Robo-Pirate servants practise their marksmanship by firing cannonballs at statues of Rayman. Soon afterwards, the Robo-Pirate army arrives in full force: the invasion begins. Some time later, Rayman, Globox and a few other members of the resistance attack the Robo-Pirates in their encampment at the Great Forest. However, at this time the pirates destroy the Heart of the World, scattering its 1000 constituent Yellow Lums across the world. The Heart's destruction causes Rayman to lose most of his powers, and the pirates capture him. Rayman encounters Razorbeard for the second time, and they exchange threats and vows of enmity. The beginning of the game picks up immediately afterwards: Globox and Ly the Fairy help Rayman to escape. Throughout the rest of the game, Razorbeard spends most of his time in the Buccaneer, where he sits on his throne, waiting for his lackey, the Spyglass Pirate, to give him news of Rayman's whereabouts. At one point in the game, he eats a Yellow Lum, reducing the maximum number on the on-screen counter from 1000 to 999; however, this Yellow Lum is later found in the Tomb of the Ancients. Razorbeard often calls for the Spyglass Pirate to send Warships out to capture Rayman, and his frustration with Rayman's constant evasion leads him to issue orders for the hero's return to him, dead or alive. At a late point in the game, Razorbeard receives a very special visitor; this is the general from Tonic Trouble, making a cameo appearance in Rayman 2. This guest offers to sell the Admiral the Grolgoth, a powerful pilot-controlled robot which could be used to kill Rayman. Razorbeard fantasises about the robot shaking Rayman to death, and decides to purchase it. He then lures Rayman to the Crow's Nest using Globox as bait. After a lengthy battle, the Grolgoth is defeated. Razorbeard flees in a flying escape pod after activating the Grolgoth's self-destruct mechanism, which destroys the Buccaneer entirely. Rayman survives the explosion, while Razorbeard flees into space in his escape pod. He is seen flying beyond the stars in the credits sequence. His current whereabouts are unknown.Rayman M  Razorbeard is one of the five playable characters that are initially available in Rayman M. This game also introduces his wife, Razorwife, who can be unlocked as a playable character. The manual for the GameCube and Xbox versions of Rayman Arena, the American localisation of Rayman M, offer the following description of Razorbeard:Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc  Razorbeard makes a brief cameo appearance in Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc, along with several of his Robo-Pirate servants. They can be found in the third part of the Hoodlum Headquarters, in a secret chamber hidden within a gigantic boiler. What appear to be statues of Razorbeard and his robots are seated at a large table, in a parody of Leonardo da Vinci's famous painting, The Last Supper, with Razorbeard in these place of Jesus. The pirates are covered in cobwebs, and do not move or speak. It is unknown if these are simply statues, or if they are the Robo-Pirates themselves, having died or run out of energy.Rayman 3(Game Boy Advance)  Razorbeard is the main villain in the Game Boy Advance version of Rayman 3. At the beginning of the game, Razorbeard is revealed to be in hiding somewhere in the Glade of Dreams, with a small group of surviving Robo-Pirates. When he learns that Globox has swallowed Andr\u00e9, Razorbeard decides to launch a new invasion, with the intent of capturing Globox and harnessing Andr\u00e9's power. At the end of the game, Rayman fights Razorbeard in another Grolgoth in the Heart of the Ancients.Rayman Kart  Razorbeard is one of six playable characters in Rayman Kart, a racing game designed for certain mobile phones. As of 2011, this is his latest appearance in the Rayman series.Rayman: The Animated Series  Razorbeard makes a brief appearance in Lac-Mac Napping, the pilot episode of the short-lived cartoon, Rayman: The Animated Series. In this series, Razorbeard is not a primary villain as he was in Rayman 2, but a mere circus employee, and a lackey to Rigatoni, the evil ringmaster. Although Razorbeard retains his irritable personality, his physical appearance has changed; he now has a mouth (which is strangely under his beard), his eyes had pupils, and his hat bears a symbol of crossed keys rather than the Robo-Pirate insignia. He now has a human, non-robotic voice, which was provided by Carlos Alazraqui.Trivia Appearances Enemies Rayman Arena  Rayman Arena (also sold as Rayman M) is a multiplayer game of the Rayman series. The game starts out with everyone from Rayman 2 getting along, but then just suddenly start fighting. This game differs from version to version. The game includes many characters, assets and elements from Rayman 2: The Great Escape. Release date:\u00a030th November 2001Content Characters Modes  The game had two modes: Racing and Battling.Racing  In Racing, the player must beat their opponent to the finish line, or beat the clock. There is a sub-mode called Lums Race where you must collect all the Lums and beat your opponent in order to win the race. This is not in the Gamecube version.Battling  In Battling, you could play Capture the Fly, where the point was to keep the large Lum behind you, Lum Capture, where you must collect as many Lums as possible, or Battle, where the player must battle on various stages using weapons. Capture the Fly is absent from the Gamecube version.Counterparts  Each character seems to have an unlockable counterpart.Voice Cast Rayman Rush  Rayman Rush is an on-foot racing game developed and published by Ubisoft, based on the Rayman universe. In many ways, it is a port of the \"Racing\" section of Rayman Arena/M, featuring conversions of eleven race tracks, a slightly edited introduction movie and character theme songs However, it lacks the battles from its predecessors. It is a 1-2 player game, and each race has 2 characters running (1 in certain game modes). The game was released 4 months after Rayman Arena/M.J.M. Murphy Segments  Murfy appears in the Nintendo Gamecube version before each race or battle. He trespasses in a training room to explain the premise of the challenge, and eavesdrop on the competitors. After being discovered he is locked in and beaten by the characters in that room. He is referred to as J.M. Murphy.Trivia Ly  Ly\u00a0is a fairy and a close friend of Rayman. She was created by Polokus and made her first appearance in Rayman 2: The Great Escape.\u00a0She can create silver lums, which gives Rayman new powers throughout the game. Ly has a calm and conteplative personality, though shows a strong playful streak. Ly has a feline tail, and is shown running on all fours in Rayman 2 and in official artwork. Ly usually \"speaks\" with an ethereal, echoed voice and shows no mouth movement, this might indicate she usually uses telepathy, especially since her lines in \"The Walk of Life\" and \"The Walk of Power\" are spoken normally.Appearances Trivia References Andr\u00e9  Andr\u00e9 or Andy is the main antagonist of Rayman 3. He is the leader of the Hoodlum Army. His plan was to rule the Glade of Dreams, but he instead was swallowed by Globox. Like Hoodlums, he enjoys Plum Juice, fermented that is. He is very cruel and tends to make insults to Rayman, such as calling him \"Lame-man\" and \"blondie\". He torments Globox by forcing him to drink Plum Juice, even though Globox is allergic to it. He is probably the most violent villain in the series.Abilities\u00a0\u00a0  Despite his size, Andr\u00e9 has shown to have superstrength (he can lift Globox in the air for a short time inside his stomach and pull open the doors far enough to fit through). Andr\u00e9 is the only blacklum with limbs, he also\u00a0can transform redlums into a blacklum\u00a0with just a touch. \u00a0Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc  Andr\u00e9 is the main antagonist of this game. Andr\u00e9 starts by transforming Red Lums\u00a0into Black Lums. Once enough had turned, he and the others combine, and Andre becomes the very first Hoodlum. Rayman confronts him in Fairy Council, and with the help of Murfy, defeats him. But Globox accidentally swallows Andr\u00e9 when the Black Lum was trying to reach The Heart of the World. For the majority of the game, Andre is trapped inside Globox's stomach, taunting Rayman, seeing doctors and forcing Globox to drink plum juice.After the three doctors team up to release Andr\u00e9, he escapes before they can contain him, gathers a swarm of Black Lums and then makes an alliance with Reflux. After Reflux is defeated, Andr\u00e9 is turned into a Red Lum. In the end Globox misses Andr\u00e9, who has seemed to have grown an attachment to Andr\u00e9, calling him \"Andy\" as his own nickname, so Rayman assured Globox that Andr\u00e9 is much more happy as a Red Lum. The scene then goes to earlier, when Rayman's hands wander off and frightened a Red Lum, which turns into Andr\u00e9.Rayman: Hoodlum's Revenge  In this direct sequel to Rayman 3, a small piece of Andr\u00e9 is still inside of Globox. He begins to take over Globox's body and his horde of hoodlums attempt to clone Reflux.Trivia The Magician  The Magician (or his real name as Ales Mansay in Rayman Origins) is a magical individual who has appeared throughout the Rayman series usually as a seemingly helpful ally but with his own goals to further.Appearance Rayman  In the original Rayman game, he appears as a Rayperson, his physical design being the same as Rayman's, only his clothing and abilities appear to be different. He is seen\u00a0with long blonde hair. He wears a purple coat with two blue buttons. He also sports a top hat with a star on it and carries around a magic wand or cane. His shoes are purple with pink stripes; and his eyes are never seen. He also shows the ability to disappear inside his hat.Rayman Origins  In Rayman Origins, the Magician was redesigned to resemble a Teensie (it is unclear if this is the same character that appeared in the original game). He has fake grey hair strapped to his hat; which has also been redesigned slightly (with the star now placed in a higher position at the top of his hat whereas in Rayman 1 it is seen at the bottom of his hat). During the levels, he displays some wisdom and gives tips, and throughout the game, offers Electoons for the collected Lums which he then uses to power his machines.Personality  Throughout most of the series, he always seemed to have a friendly and helpful nature, willing to help Rayman out on certain occasions and even seemed to be friends with Betilla. However, behind his seemingly friendly persona, he is in fact a sinister and rebellious individual who is a loyal follower of Mr. Dark's and seeks to overthrow the divine Polokus, seeing him as nothing more than a creator of nightmares and desires to rule the world in the name of Mr. Dark, not caring at all about his old friends and creator.History Rayman  He explains the plot synopsis at the beginning of the game. He is basically the narration for the game, as he narrates the ending scene as well. His hat and the electoon collector is the symbol for saving the game. He appears in many levels to offer special minigames in exchange for a few tings. If you are away from him, his hat only appears and not his whole body. If you go close at him, his whole body comes out of his hat. If you don't have 10 tings or more, he will not allow you unless you have at least 10 of them.Rayman Origins  In Rayman Origins, the Magician has returned as a Teensie. Rayman and Co. will trade lums for the Electoons he has found at the end of each level. Players can smack his hat for helpful hints at the beginning of early levels.Plot Twist!  However, in a plot twist, The Magician was a villain all along! He used the lums to power his fortress, full of deadly machines and lasers up in the Moody Clouds. When Rayman, Globox, and the Teensies confront him, he rips the star of his Hat, jumps on his desk, strikes a menacing pose, and pulls a Lever, sending the 4 adventurers into a pit. Here resided Mecha Daisy and Mecha Bird Queen. They are fought similarly to their living counterparts, except the fights are both shorter and harder. After looping right back into his (Magician's) room, he is scared by the fact that Rayman and the others are still alive. He then falls of his desk, and his hat falls off. However, the magician is not done yet, as he begins to mix a funky beat, and tricks Rayman, Globox and the Teensies into dancing with him. Little did they know, the Magician used this as a head start to escape them and his collapsing fortress. Rayman and Co. chased through the fortification, only for the little Fiend to escape on an airship. It seems all hope is lost, but Moskito and his friends show up just in time. Rayman's group and Moskito's group work together to pursue the fleeing Magician, eventually causing his airship to fly into the core of the fort, thus making the Fortress DETONATE causing a MASSIVE EXPLOSION!! Rayman and Co. Fall back down to the snoring tree, and resume lazing around, as if nothing had ever happened. It was the Magician who placed the Microphone-flower in the Snoring tree. The noise was amplified down to the Land of the Livid Dead, which annoyed them, causing Rayman and co. to be preoccupied with battling them. The magician used this time to ready his machines and army. Also, he will be back in new Rayman sequel, in 2017.Rayman Legends  It is shown that the Magician is not one singular Teensy but a group of 5 identical Teensies, alternatively known as Dark Teensies,\u00a0with a goal of spreading chaos and kidnapping other Teensies. They are referred as \"Dark Teensies\" and are shown to have tamed the nightmares under their control.\u00a0 At some point, one of them is shown to be able to use magic to teleport and transform Rayman and friends into ducks (Fiesta De Los Meurtos). After defeating a boss, they can be shot all the way to a moon within a flying pig constellation, where they are used as musical instruments by a curious species of unknown aliens that resemble demonic imps.Trivia Murfy  Murfy is the guide of the Rayman series, first appearing in Rayman 2: The Great Escape. He appears to be of what can seen as a fairy frog, but is actually a greenbottle, a sort of fly. His primary role in the series is to help Rayman out by giving him useful information. His personality varies from game to game, but most of the time, he is depicted as his Rayman 2 self. However, as he is smiling, no one ever sees Murfy frowning.Rayman 2: The Great Escape  In this game Murfy acts as a guidebook. He is known as the flying one-volume encyclopedia and is practically omniscient. In the PlayStation version of the game, the greenbottles are one of several different races of creatures Rayman must free from the cages scattered around the world rather than one single character. Ly replaces him as Rayman's guide in that version.Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc  He is the same as in Rayman 2 but he reads the manual rather than sharing his own knowledge/info. This was a sacrifice in consistency by Ubisoft for a more humorous depiction of Murfy. Whereas he sounded whimsical and innocent in Rayman 2, Murfy has a deeper, more masculine and mischievous voice in this game. His joking nature and willingness to stick by Rayman until he reaches the Fairy Council suggests that he is a little closer to Rayman this time around, whereas they appeared to have met for the first time in Rayman 2. In this game he makes several sarcastic comments to the manual, even when the manual threatens to fire him.Rayman 3  In the Nintendo Gameboy Advance version of Hoodlum Havoc, Murfy seems to be wise and helpful as he is in Rayman 2. He appears in the early levels to explain to Rayman how to use certain controls in the game.Rayman Arena  In Rayman Arena he acts as a newsfrog and goes into the characters' training rooms with a camera, revealing the basic summary of the pending competition. However, for doing this, someone in the training room will dash to the door and shut it before Murfy can leave, and we can hear from outside the door Murfy being brutally beaten by the others, screaming not to kick his wings or punch his eyes. Before the clip is over, we can see R.I.P. at the bottom of the screen. He is referred to as J.M. Murphy. However, this could perhaps not be Murfy, but another greenbottle with a similar name, seen as he gets pinned.Rayman: Hoodlum's Revenge  In the Rayman 3 sequel Hoodlum's Revenge, Murfy is helpful and wise once again, and teaches Rayman the controls for the game. Rayman, however, is sometimes annoyed by him in this game, once remarking, \"I've known how to do that my whole life\".Rayman Raving Rabbids (GBA)  In the Nintendo Gameboy Advance version, Murfy helped Rayman get back his lost arms, and he is our guide in the game, here he is as wise and helpful as in Rayman 2 and Rayman 3 (GBA), but here Murfy is also a little ironic, as the Rayman 3 console version. In the intro of the game, Murfy's name is misspelled \"Murphy\". Also, Murfy appeared in the Rabbid Shootout as a target that Rayman is not supposed to shoot.Rayman Raving Rabbids 2  In the second installment of the Rabbids spin-off franchise, Murfy is absent, however in each of the minigames he is credited with having the #3 top high score with 6,000 points, suggesting he's still pretty knowledgeable about Rayman Games.Rayman Origins  In Rayman Origins, Murfy talks to Rayman and co. and tells Rayman how many Electoons he needs for the new characters and new levels. If you die too many times, he will ask you if you want to leave the level.Rayman Legends  In the sequel to Rayman Origins, Murphy is a playable assistant that can aid players by cutting ropes, activating switches, and otherwise moving objects around the screen using the Wii U Gamepad/Vita Touch Screen. In the PS3/PS4/360/XB1/PC versions, he is controlled by button controls.Trivia Games Core Games Handheld Games Mobile Games Side Games Educational Rabbids Polokus  Polokus (also known as The Bubble Dreamer) is the spirit and supreme creator of the world, including all its marvelous creatures.Appearance In Rayman 2  In this game, Polokus appears as a creature of short stature. Wearing pants and a top hat. He also has really long arms that extends almost twice his own height and large feet.In Rayman Origins onward  As of Rayman Origins, he appears to resemble a large pale-skinned elderly Glute, with orange hair tied into a small ponytail and a very long orange beard. He no longer wears clothing and instead the only items he has on his person is a small red parasol and a pair of round black sunglasses.Personality  While originally depicted as focused on his duties and existing outside the world during the earlier games, Rayman Origins shows him as now being a more social and carefree deity who does not stay in his sacred realm, preferring to live amongst his creations which he cares about dearly and enjoys having fun with. He has pretty much become a hedonist who enjoys simply laying about, having fun with his creations and indulging in the funner and more relaxing things in life while he dreams up new creations. This behavior has even filtered down to his creations, who have also become more easygoing, fun-loving and silly. While his dreams can bring forth beauty and happiness, his nightmares can create evil and darkness which can bring chaos to his world and even corrupt his creations if strong enough.History Beginning  According to the lore, Polokus was brought into being by the combined willpower of the Lums, and his power was such that even his smallest thoughts become reality, being responsible for the creation of all the creatures of the world. His first creations were the Nymphs, who became his most beloved creations. Unfortunately, his nightmares became reality as well, creating many vicious monsters. Once Polokus had created the world, he departed to a sacred place where gods dream up the future, but not before splitting his power up into four masks and instructing the fairies to call back him should something go wrong by reuniting them.Rayman 2  In Rayman 2, when the Robot Pirates began their conquest of the world, Ly saw fit to send Rayman on a quest to collect the masks and recall Polokus. After doing so, Polokus was able to rid the planet of the robot scourge, but since his power came directly from the Lums which it was made of, he was unable to do anything against the pirate ships high in the sky, leaving Rayman to deal with them.Rayman Origins  In Rayman Origins, Polokus, now simply referred to as \"The Bubble Dreamer\" resides among his creations in the Glade of Dreams and has taken up an easygoing and hedonistic lifestyle. He attempted to fight alongside Rayman, Globox, and the Teensies when their snoozing stirred the Livid Dead into attacking, only for all of them to end up being imprisoned, with Polokus being rendered insane for much of the game as a result and needing a lot of\u00a0Electoons\u00a0to fix him.Rayman Legends  In\u00a0Rayman Legends, the Bubble Dreamer weaved a story of how Rayman and the crew slept for one hundred years, and in that time, nightmares began to multiply and diversify, and The Magician\u00a0becoming the 5 Dark Teensies, and prompted Murfy to wake the heroes up. He can be seen in the Main Gallery, offering advise to those who jump in front of him.Trivia Electoons  Electoons are the inhabitants of Rayman's world. They have pink, round bodies and, like Rayman, they are limbless. They spend most of their time playing and singing. They have some sort of a connection with the Great Protoon Orb. Like the Orb, they, too, were kidnapped by the evil and mysterious, Mr. Dark. There is another type of Electoons and these are the Anti-Toons. They resemble the Electoons, but are black in color and particularly not very nice. They attack by biting. Rayman is made of Electoons, this is made clear if Rayman dies in Rayman 1. During the events of Rayman 1 Mr. Dark traps all of the Electoons in several locked cages throughout Rayman's world, most in hidden and hard to reach places. However, Rayman has to collect them all, or else he will be unable to get inside the Candy Chateau. Electoons re-appear in Rayman Origins\u00a0where they are again trapped in locked cages, following Rayman and crew's imprisonment and\u00a0The Bubble Dreamer's descent into insanity, and are needed to cure said insanity. By collecting enough Electoons, players can unlock costumes in the\u00a0Snoring Tree, as well as\u00a0Tricky Treasure levels\u00a0and special levels\u00a0revolving around Electoons.Trivia Bosses Subcategories  This category has only the following subcategory.F  Pages in category \"Bosses\" The following 39 pages are in this category, out of 39 total.A B C D F G H J L M M cont.

Potions have a variety of effects, including curing poison, temporarily raising or restoring certain skills, or poisoning weapons. Potion boosts will generally allow players to perform certain feats that would otherwise require a few levels higher to do so. However, some quests' skill requirements do not allow boosts to be used. Getting started in Herblaw requires completion of the Druidic Ritual quest, which will raise the player's Herblaw level to 3 (the level required to make the first potion). It is usually impossible to start Herblaw without completing this quest.Obtaining herbs  Herbs are a lot less common in Classic than they are in RuneScape 2. The best way to obtain herbs is from monster drops. Chaos druids, chaos druid warriors and men are great for obtaining herbs as they drop them frequently. Another option is to buy the herbs off of other players. Usually, larger amounts of herbs can be found for sale on the forums, but players will also sell them in banks (especially Draynor) on occasion. Players can trade both identified and unidentified herbs.Identifying herbs  When herbs\u00a0are first obtained as\u00a0drops from monsters, they are unidentified. Unidentified herbs stack in your bank according to their type. In order to be able to use these herbs to make potions, a player must identify what the herb is by clicking on it in the inventory screen. Different herbs require different levels to identify.Mixing potions  Making a potion requires a vial filled with water, a herb, and a secondary ingredient. Vials can be made using the Crafting skill, or bought from the Taverley herb shop. Water can be added to an empty vial by using it on a sink, fountain, or other water sources. Vials already containing water are sold by Kortan in his East Ardougne general store, allowing players to save time. Secondary ingredients vary widely. Secondary ingredients may be found in shops, as a spawn, or obtained through monster drops. See below for level requirements.Secondary ingredients  Each potion requires an additional ingredient after an herb is added in order to complete it. These ingredients are obtained in various ways throughout RuneScape Classic.Herblaw certificates  Some Herblaw supplies can be exchanged for certificates. Sidney Smith, in Yanille, will exchange the following certificates for Herblaw items (and vice versa):Quest rewards  The following quests offer Herblaw experience rewards:Trivia Wine  Wine is a drink that heals 11 Hits and lowers Attack by 3 levels when consumed. Wine can be made at level 35 Cooking by placing grapes in a jug of water giving the player 110 Cooking experience. This may fail, which results in the player receiving bad wine. The player must then wait 6 ticks (3.6 seconds) for the wine to mature, assuming that they have not failed. Once level 70 Cooking has been reached, it is no longer possible to fail maturing the wine.Other uses Trivia Sold by RuneScape Classic Map Official World Map History Trivia See also Smithing  For information on training this skill, see Smithing training. Smithing is one of several skills in RuneScape Classic. It allows players to make armour and weapons to sell to other players or to use for themselves. Unlike Mining, Fishing and Woodcutting, which are gathering skills, Smithing is a production skill. It takes raw materials obtained from a gathering skill, in this case mining, and makes something else. It is popular because it can make a profit, and lets you provide equipment for you and your friends. Smithing has two distinct parts: smelting, which is taking the ores from mining and turning them into metal bars, and forging, which is taking those bars and turning them into metal items.Tools  Although most of the times the smithing skill requires for players to make use of the hammer, there are some additional tools that they may seldomly make use of. The Gauntlets of goldsmithing is a quest reward from Family Crest and although the Cannon ammo mould is tradable, players still need to have completed the Dwarf Cannon quest to make use of it.Smelting  Once you've acquired all the ores you need, you need to smelt them into bars. Furnace locations consist of: The Al Kharid furnace is considered to be the most efficient because of its small distance from the bank. Below is a table of bars, experience, and ores required:Forging  Forging requires using a metal bar on an anvil with hammer in inventory. Anvils are located at the following places:Bronze Iron Steel Mithril Adamantite Runite Legendary Dragon Square Shield  +  = At level 60 smithing you can repair the Dragon Square Shield. You will need both the left square half, an extremely rare drop from various monsters, and the right square half, purchased from Legends' Guild store for 750,000 coins. Hammering the shield at an anvil gives 75 smithing experience.Quests  The following quests give smithing experience rewards:Trivia See also Items  This category contains a list of items in RuneScape Classic.Monsters  All monsters we have in the database. See also: BestiaryQuests  Quests are groups of related tasks, usually delegated and driven between the player and multiple non-player characters. These can take varying amounts of time to complete and form some sort of cohesive story, comprised of dialogue and scripted events. Upon completing a quest, the player will receive a pre-determined number of Quest Points and some type of reward in the form of coins, items, or access to new content. There are a total of fifty quests in the game with the last to be released being Legend's Quest. The list of quests can be found by clicking the Quest tab on the right side of the Stats page. Quests that have been highlighted in green are those that have been completed, otherwise they are marked red. Since the release of pay-to-play membership, every quest has been exclusively available to pay-to-play players only. The last free-to-play quest to be released was Dragon Slayer.Quest requirements  The following shows the minimum skill requirements to complete every quest in the game. Note: boosts may be used to meet the skill requirementsList of Quests Free to Play (Difficulty Level) (Quest Point(s) Reward) Pay to Play (Difficulty Level) (Quest Point(s) Reward) Miniquests  Miniquests are a similar concept to quests in Runescape in that certain tasks must be done, but unlike quests they are not shown in the Quests tab, no Quest Points are given, and are generally shorter in length than quests. In Runescape Classic only one miniquest was featured, the Alfred Grimhand Bar Crawl, being required for the Barbarian Outpost Agility Course and the Scorpion Catcher quest.Trivia See also Dragon axe  The Dragon axe (also referred to as the dragon battleaxe) is the strongest weapon in RuneScape Classic. Wielding this axe requires level 60 Attack and completion of Hero's Quest. It can be bought from Helemos inside the Heroes' Guild for 200,000 coins or obtained by trading with another player. It has the highest WeaponPower bonus of 75, but its WeaponAim of 69 is surpassed by the Dragon sword which has a WeaponAim bonus of 71. The dragon axe is a one-handed weapon, allowing players to equip a shield for an additional Armour bonus. This axe is made of Dragon metal and cannot be created by players using the Smithing skill. There are no monsters that drop this weapon, making Helemos at the Heroes Guild the only source of this item, although it is tradable between players. The dragon axe has always been exclusive to Classic pay-to-play members. It was simultaneously with the Dragon sword and Heroes' Guild during the first release of RuneScape members content. Despite a distinct difference in being named an axe and not a Battle Axe, it cannot be used for Woodcut. Many players would refer to the dragon axe as a dragon battle axe during Classic's most popular days. In RuneScape 2 it was renamed the Dragon battle axe.Popularity  This weapon is one of the most popular among higher level players in RuneScape Classic. It is favoured by players due to its high WeaponPower and WeaponAim bonuses. It is effective for training, questing, and PKing. Since all weapons hit at the same speed, it is one of the two most effective weapons for players with the requirements to wield it, if they can afford the 200,000 GP price.Requirements for using Quest-based requirements King Black Dragon  The King Black Dragon (or KBD) is the strongest and highest leveled monster which can be found living in Gielinor on RuneScape Classic. Players usually fight the dragon alone using melee, but it is possible to have another player ranging or casting spells on him from afar. However, it should be noted that ranged and prayer are significantly drained upon attacking, and therefore not reliable to use. Unlike other game versions, the KBD doesn't directly inflict poison, however a Cure poison Potion may still prove necessary for the journey. He can be found in his lair deep inside the Wilderness near the Lava maze. The ladder leading down to his lair is surrounded by severalLesser demons and Poison spiders. The KBD is often fought for its rare and valuable drops including the uncut dragonstone, left half dragon square shield and dragon medium helmet.Recommended Equipment  Note: The Anti-dragon shield is only needed at the start of a fight with the King black dragon, and some players choose to retreat and switch to a Rune kite shield or Dragon square shield for increased defense immediately after taking the first hit. The same gear would be used by a mage with the addition of a chosen god cape/spell and charge. Players using ranged should use a magic longbow and rune arrows. Note an Anti-dragon shield is only needed at the start of a fight with the King black dragon, and some players choose to switch to a Rune kite shield or Dragon square shield for increased defense immediately after taking the first hit.Trivia Dragon sword  The Dragon sword (often referred to as the Dragon Longsword) is the second most powerful weapon available. It requires completion of the Lost City quest and level 60 attack to wield. Since it is a one-handed weapon, it can be used in conjunction with a shield, allowing for additional Defense bonuses. The Dragon Sword can be purchased from the Dragon Sword Shop in Zanaris marketplace, entrance to the marketplace will cost the player one cut diamond. Jakut has 2 in stock per world at 100,000 coins each. You may own an unlimited number of Dragon swords. Although the dragon sword is not as powerful as the Dragon battleaxe, it has the highest WeaponAim bonus of any weapon, leading some players to favour it over the axe in some situations, such as training the Attack skill which is an accurate style of Combat. It has no special attack as these were not a feature in RuneScape Classic. The Dragon sword was more appropriately named Dragon Longsword in Runescape 2 to better match its attributes.Dragon medium Helmet  The Dragon medium Helmet provides the highest Armour bonus in RuneScape Classic of any helmet and requires a defense level of 60 to wear. It is a rare drop from some of the strongest monsters in the game and as a result is quite expensive, and players may sell them for as much as 1-2 million coins. It was the third piece of dragon equipment and the first piece of dragon armour released. It is now one of four dragon pieces of equipment in RuneScape Classic, and one of two pieces of dragon armour.Thieving  For information on training this skill, see Thieving training. Thieving is a skill in RuneScape Classic which allows players to steal from non-player characters whether by pickpocketing or stealing from stalls and chests. Thieving proves to be quite profitable and is generally used to make money as coins and valuable items are obtained in the process. There are three ways to train the thieving skill: pickpocketing, looting chests, and looting stalls. The thieving skill was released on 30 April 2002 with East Ardougne and the Tribal Totem quest. East Ardougne is the area with the most thieving-related content in the game.Getting started  In order to begin training the thieving skill, players must start by pickpocketing before they can steal from stalls. Pickpocketing men is the only option at level one thieving. Men can be found near the initial spawn point in Lumbridge, making the skill readily available for new players.Pickpocket  Players can pickpocket specific non-player characters by right-clicking on them and choosing the \"pickpocket\" option. If the pickpocket is successful, the player will receive some loot and thieving experience. If the pickpocket fails, then the NPC will engage in combat with the player. To continue pickpocketing, the player must run away, or kill the NPC and wait for it to respawn. When pickpocketing, many players have food, and armour equipped, but no weapon, to avoid killing the NPC or taking too much damage.Stalls  Throughout\u00a0Gielinor are many stalls that players can steal from. The most common location for stealing from stalls is the East Ardougne market. Looting stalls is another alternative to pickpocketing and requires a higher thieving level to begin. To steal from a stall, find a stall that can be looted, right-click on it and select the option \"steal from\". Once a player steals from a stall, it will take several seconds for the items to re-spawn. If the player is unsuccessful, the player will be attacked by a guard, knight, paladin, or hero depending on the level required to steal from the stall.Chests  The thieving skill can be used to unlock a number of chests throughout Gielinor, and receive the loot inside. This is done by right-clicking on the door and selecting 'picklock'.Doors  Some doors can only be unlocked through use of the thieving skill.Training  For detailed information on training, see Thieving training.Quests  Thieving is required to complete several quests: Additionally: The following quests give thieving experience as a reward:Trivia Fishing  For information on training this skill, see Fishing training. Fishing is a skill in RuneScape Classic that allows players to catch fish which can then be eaten when cooked using the Cooking skill.Starting out  Head to Gerrant's Fishy Business in Port Sarim or Harry's Fishing Shack in Catherby to buy some equipment. After you have a fishing item you need to find areas where you can fish. On the world map, areas with a red fish means it's a fishing spot. You can use the cooking skill to cook your fish or you could simply sell them to players raw or to the general store.Fishing Equipment  To fish in RuneScape Classic you will need a tool with which to fish. Fishing tools can be purchased at fishing shops found in Port Sarim and Catherby. Oily Fishing Rod is only obtainable during Hero's Quest.Fish  There are many different types of fish that can be caught throughout RuneScape Classic. When a player catches a fish, it will come in raw form which must be cooked before it can be used as food to restore Hits.Other items  While fishing with big nets you will occasionally catch things other than fish like the following:Fishing locations  See: Fishing spot for more details on the types of fishing spotsNet / Bait Lure / Bait Harpoon / Cage Big Net / Harpoon Special Quests Bug/Glitch Trivia References Dragon Square Shield  The Dragon square shield has the greatest defense of any shield in RuneScape Classic, but it can only be worn after completion of Legends' Quest. To obtain one, you must first purchase the right half for a hefty 750,000 coins from the Legends' Guild store. Then, you must obtain the left half as an extremely rare drop from various monsters. Shadow Warriors in the Legends' Guild dungeon have a slightly higher chance of dropping the left half. Once you have both halves of the shield, go to any anvil with level 60 smithing and you will be able to combine the two halves, creating the legendary dragon square shield. The Dragon square shield has +4 higher armour bonus than the rune kiteshield. The item's icon can be misleading,\u00a0because when it is worn this shield does not display a dragon symbol, it will just appear as a plain red shield. This shield can often cost anywhere between 10-15 million coins in player-to-player trade. Because of this, this shield is used mainly by wealthy players and players who were lucky enough to receive the left half as a drop.Complete list of requirements to wear this shield Quests  (might be missing some prerequisites)Skills Messages  When player is lacking requirements to equip:Mining  For information on training this skill, see the Mining Training article. Mining is a skill in RuneScape Classic that allows players to mine rocks and obtain various ores and minerals. Ores can be smelted into bars and then forged into armour and weapons.Pickaxes  Before attempting to mine a rock, a player must have a pickaxe. The higher the level the pickaxe, the more swings the player will automatically take at the rock you are trying to mine with one click. Pickaxes can be bought from Nurmof's Pickaxe Shop in the Dwarven Mine. Bronze Pickaxes can also be bought from various General Stores and other shops.Rocks  Unlike modern RuneScape, attempting to mine a rock containing ore you do not have the mining level for does not warn you that you cannot mine it. You will instead receive the message \"You only succeed in scratching the rock\".Gems  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While mining rocks for ores, players may randomly find an uncut gem which include sapphires, emeralds, rubies and diamonds. Finding a gem from regular rock gives no mining experience. Mining gem rocks found in Shilo Village is a faster way to obtain uncut gems but the mine can only be accessed after completing the Shilo Village quest. The higher level rocks have greater likelihood of finding a gem and wearing Charged Dragonstone Amulet also increases the chance. Uncut gems can be used in the crafting skill to create various pieces of jewellery.Certing  The following certificates can be exchanged by Giles in Draynor Village or by Jinno in Zanaris. Certing ores is useful to trade bulk amounts easier and faster.Locations  There are various mining sites in Runescape Classic each with their own strengths and weaknesses. For a complete list of mines, see the Mines article. For where to train mining most efficiently, see Mining Training article.Quests  Mining is required to complete various quests: Mining plays an important role in Digsite quest. Players can search the specimen trays, dig in level 1, 2 and 3 sites and pan for gold nuggets in the nearby river. See: Digsite (location) for more information The following quests give mining experience as a reward:Trivia References See also Party Hat  A Party Hat is a discontinued item that was obtained during the 2001 Christmas Event. They were obtained by pulling a Christmas Cracker with another player. Party Hats do not provide any stat bonuses when worn; they are purely decorational. Party Hats were sold for very small amounts at the time of the event, however because they are discontinued and rare they became increasingly sought after. Party Hats are now worth millions of coins, and are worn as a symbol of wealth by players.Colours Trivia Crafting  For information on training this skill, see Crafting training. Crafting is a very diverse production skill in RuneScape Classic. Crafting consists of leather working, pottery making, crafting jewellery, spinning, crafting glass, and crafting battlestaves. At level 40, players may enter the Crafting Guild .Tools  The crafting skill requires many tools that must be kept in the inventory whilst crafting. All of the tools except the glassblowing pipe can be purchased in the Dommik's Crafting Store at the east side of Al Kharid or in the Rommik's Crafty Supplies at Rimmington. The glassblowing pipe can be found in a building on Entrana or Hemenster.Leather Working  Leather working is a great way to start crafting, however it does require a small amount of cash to start out. In order to make leather, players need cowhides, a needle, multiple thread and some coins. Steps for making leather:Pottery  Making pottery is a great way to start crafting. Players will need to use a pottery wheel and pottery oven in order to make pottery. Steps for making pottery:Gems  Cutting gems requires the player to use a chisel on an uncut gem.Shilo Village gems  There are also three types of gems that can be mined from gem rocks in Shilo Village. These gems can be cut for Crafting experience. However, with these you can fail this task, leaving only a Crushed Gemstone.Jewellery  Jewellery is a major part of the crafting skill where players can create jewellery to wear. Each form of jewellery requires a mould, a gold bar and a gem for the type of jewellery the player wishes to create. Once a player has these materials in their inventory, using a gold bar on a furnace will allow the player to craft the jewellery. Furnaces can be found in Lumbridge, Falador, Ardougne, Al Kharid, and Lost City. After a player has crafted an amulet from a furnace, they must complete the amulet by attaching a string to it by using a ball of wool on the amulet. This does not grant additional experience. Rings and necklaces are relatively useless in RuneScape Classic as they cannot be enchanted through magic spells. Only the amulets can be enchanted by casting the correct enchantment spell on a fully completed amulet. See magic for more details on enchantment spells.Gold  Gold jewellery provides no bonuses and the amulet cannot be enchanted.Spinning  Spinning is done on spinning wheels found throughout RuneScape Classic. Spinning wheels can be found next to the Falador east bank, upstairs in a building south west of Seers' Village bank, in the small building closest to Varrock in Barbarian Village, and upstairs in Lumbridge Castle. To spin wool or flax, simply use the item on the spinning wheel.Glass Making  Making glass is a long process that requires a glassblowing pipe which can be found in a building on Entrana. Steps for making glass:Battlestaves  Making elemental battlestaves is a long and involved process and requires relatively high crafting and magic levels. Steps for making battlestaves: Battlestaves can also be enchanted by Thormac the sorceror upon completion of the Scorpion Catcher quest for 40,000 coins to increase the WeaponAim and WeaponPower stats from +35 to +50.Quests  Crafting is used in various quests.Trivia See also Woodcutting  Woodcutting is a skill available on RuneScape Classic. The skill consists of cutting down trees and obtaining logs. A higher woodcutting level will give players more trees to cut and a better chance of chopping down a tree. After having been cut down, a tree will respawn after a certain amount of time.Messages  It is possible to fail to cut a tree, in which the following message will appear:Types of logs  Many different kinds of logs can be gathered with the woodcutting skill at increasingly higher woodcutting levels. All logs can be used to make bows with the fletching skill. Furthermore, logs can be burnt with the firemaking skill. However, unlike RuneScape 2, Only regular logs can be used for firemaking, not the higher level logs.Types of axes  The better the axe, the better the chance of successfully chopping a tree and receiving logs. Unlike RuneScape 2, there is no woodcutting level requirement to use each axe for woodcutting. Bob's Brilliant Axes is a shop in Lumbridge that sells bronze to steel axes. Higher level axes can only be acquired through smithing, as a drop from certain NPCs, or by trading with other players.Log certificates  Some types of logs can be exchanged for certificates. The certificates are worth 5 logs of that type, and stack for easier carrying and trading of large numbers of logs. Chuck on the north side of East Ardougne will exchange the following logs for certificates and vice versa:Quests  Woodcutting is use a bit in quests. The following quests offer woodcutting experience rewards:Trivia Dragon Slayer Walkthrough  Before beginning the quest, it is recommended you have all or most of the items required (see above) already as it will greatly speed up the quest.First map piece  Head to a bank in Falador and stock up for combat against several monsters including a level 79 Lesser demon. Use of Silverlight may help lower leveled players defeat this high leveled monster. Good food, full prayer points, and potions are all good items to bring if you have them.Second map piece  Before talking to the Oracle on Ice Mountain, have these four items in your inventory: a Wizard's Mind Bomb, silk, lobster pot, and an Unfired Bowl. \"The map's behind a door below,\n but entering is rather tough.\n This is what you need to know,\n You must have the following stuff:\n First, a drink used by a mage,\n Next, some worm string changed to a sheet,\n Then, a small crustacean cage,\n Last, a bowl that's not seen heat.\"Third map piece  The third map piece is the least time consuming to get. Make sure you have the runes for Telekinetic grab  (1 law-rune, 1 air-rune), and a Ranged weapon or runes to cast magic spells.Purchasing the Lumbridge Lady  You have the map, now you need a ship. For this part you will need 2,000 coins, 12 nails (made from 6 steel bars, 34 smithing required), 3 planks, and a hammer. You are now ready to slay the dragon Elvarg!Killing Elvarg  All that is left to do now is kill Elvarg. Make sure to pick up an Anti dragon breath Shield from the Duke of Lumbridge, found on the upper floor of the castle in Lumbridge. You should bring the best armour and one-handed weapon you can use, along with the anti dragon breath shield, though you may bring another shield as well as you will be near aggressive mid-to-high level monsters. Any extra spaces in your inventory should be filled with lots of food and any potions or runes you would like to use. Some players choose to cast spells with magic while fighting with melee. Teleport runes are recommended if you want to avoid walking past skeletons and several Lesser Demons after the fight. You can now return to Oziach and purchase a Rune Plate Mail Body for 65,000 coins.Rewards Trivia RuneScape Classic  RuneScape Classic (also known as RS1 or RS Classic) is the forerunner to RuneScape 2, which was the previous form of the game, being succeeded by RuneScape 3. It was originally created by Andrew and Paul Gower. RuneScape Classic could be found on the official RuneScape homepage when searching for \"Classic\" in the game guide. It was during the Classic period when the game began to develop its cult status, allowing for the demand which created RuneScape 2.The closing of RuneScape Classic  RuneScape Classic servers were shut down indefinitely on 6 August 2018 at approximately 5:06 AM (US Eastern time zone). It is not known if the game studio who curated the game, Jagex, intends to ever open up the servers again. The game is now inaccessible in it's official and authentic form through Jagex. The section of Jagex's website where players could find access to Classic displayed only the veteran server (world 1) after the removal, however it was inaccessible even by veteran accounts, leading to speculation as to whether or not this was a visual glitch. servers was removed hours after the closure of the game, and official Classic forums found on the RuneScape website were removed just days later.Beginnings  When the idea of RuneScape first came into programming, it was developed under the name of Devious MUD. Although never released, Andrew rewrote it, set it out as a beta for about one week, and then withdrew it. It was reworked, and released under the name of RuneScape as a beta in 4 January 2001. Later on in that year, the Gower brothers and Constant Tedder formed the company Jagex.Accounts  RuneScape Classic closed indefinitely on 6 August 2018. Prior to this, there were several closing and opening period where the game became acessible to new players provided that they hold active RuneScape pay-to-play membership. Previously, to access Classic, an account had to be Classic-enabled - having played once within the dates of 3 August 2005 to 3 February 2006, or logged in during at least one of the two-week temporary open periods.Gameplay  In RuneScape Classic, players control a 2-D online avatar. These avatars can be customized by the player by various clothing, weapons, armour, and hair style. Many of the items needed to customize are sold by other players or in-game shops. The users can interact with each other by talking, trading, dueling, and participating in many other activities. Almost all onscreen actions are performed by pointing and clicking with the mouse.Worlds  Each player is connected to a \"world\", where all players in that world can interact with each other. Players on different worlds may private message each other. There has also been a patch to allow Classic players to message friends playing Old School RuneScape and RuneScape 3 There are currently 5 servers, sometimes referred to as \"worlds\" for RuneScape Classic. World 1 is for veteran players only, a distinction given to those who logged into RuneScape Classic between August 2005 and January 2006. Worlds 2, 3, 4, and 5 are the only worlds available to all players.Skills  There are a variety of skills in RuneScape Classic, from combat skills, to gathering skills. Training skills is one of the things many people choose to do, as it can unlock many advantages over others in the game. Some of the advantages is able to produce your own armours, or fight a mighty foes. An example of a skill can be woodcutting, where a player chops trees to collect logs. Several advanced quests have high skill level requirements, particularly in combat.Quests  Quests are an important part of the game play and progression in Classic. Some quests are standalone adventures, while others have multiple quests in a series, tell a longer story/adventure, and affect the world of the player more distinctly. There are quests which even allow the player to make their own choices, choose sides, and other variations which allow more freedom to the player. Quests can take a variety of skills to complete, with some having fairly high requirements for the players stats in order to complete or even start the quest. Once a quest has been completed, the player is rewarded with quest points, and often items, experience, new areas to explore, items to collect, NPC's to talk to, monsters to fight, and more. The final quest to be developed and released for Classic was Legends' Quest.Classes  Early July 2002, players used to choose a class when creating an account. Depending on the class chosen, new players would start with a higher level in the appropriate skill at a compensation of lower skill levels in other areas. Tutorial Island in 24 September 2002 followed the removal. When the class system was removed and prior to tutorial island, all new players would start with a bronze hatchet, one piece of cooked meat, and tinderbox, like adventurers.Forums  The Official RuneScape Forums has a section for RuneScape Classic users. To gain access to these forums, you need to have a members account. These forums are hidden to those that are not logged in. Before January 2009, anyone could have viewed the Classic forums, and many non-RuneScape Classic players were spamming and creating threads requesting RuneScape Classic to be reopened. Jagex closed access to the Classic section of the forums, and only users who had an active Classic account logged into the forums would be able access this board, by submitting an application in a dedicated thread. After the temporary re-opening of RuneScape Classic in November 2009, Jagex re-opened the Classic section of the forums to all users, and it is now available without the need to submit an application.Re-openings  On 11 November 2009, Classic was reopened to RuneScape Members. This was done to raise awareness of the game and to allow curious players to experience it. Any members account that signed up in the two week period after the reopening will continue to have access to RuneScape Classic after the deadline. Further re-openings happened on 1 June 2010 and on 14 September 2011. Furthermore, it was re-opened in celebration of RuneScape's 15th anniversary between 11 January and 11 March 2016, after being announced at RuneFest 2015. The reopening was then indefinitely extended.Playing RuneScape Classic  With the games servers having gone offline indefinitely on 6 August 2018, it is now impossible to play the official version of Classic via Jagex. There is currently no permanent direct link to RuneScape Classic from the RuneScape website. During the two-week open period, the link was the third button down on the right sidebar. Nowadays to access the game, players can search for \"Classic\" in the search bar and find the RuneScape Classic page. Click here to go to RuneScape Classic world select page. With the added support of Runescape Classic on the official downloadable client, players may create a desktop shortcut and play there directly. Alternatively, you can save and visit the links on the world select page, which will attempt to open your Runescape Client.References Magic  For information on training this skill, see Magic training. Magic is a skill in Runescape Classic that allows players to cast spells using runes. Many of the spells can be cast on monsters and other players to inflict damage or decrease stats. Aside from combat spells, the magic spellbook also offers many useful spells such as teleportation, enchantment and alchemy. When a player successfully casts a spell on an opponent, a blue star represents the spell and is shot toward the enemy. Players with level 66 magic or higher, can access the Wizards' Guild in Yanille.Spells  There are many spells in the magic spell book. Each spell has a different effect and requires a different combination of runes in order for them to be cast. Upon casting a spell, the player will receive an amount of experience calculated using the formula: $ 20 + L2 $ Where L is equal to the level required to cast that spell. Every spell has the chance to be cast unsuccessfully which will result in the player having to wait 20 seconds before they are able to cast another spell. Failing a spell will not use up the runes in the players inventory and the player will not gain any magic experience. Having a higher magic level and wearing equipment with magic bonuses will reduce the chance of failing a spell, and you tend to stop failing to cast a spell around 10 Magic levels above the magic level requirement of the spell you're currently casting (For example you would stop failing to cast the high level alchemy spell at around 65 Magic). Having a higher magic level won't affect how hard you hit. While casting combat spells, successfully cast spells can still hit the opponent for 0 Hits.Equipment  Unlike RuneScape 2, armour does not decrease the magic bonus when equipped which is the reason it is often worn by mages instead of equipment that raises their magic bonus. The following items increase a Player's magic bonus:Head Neck Top Bottom Cape Weapon Training  Magic is one of the hardest skills to train in RuneScape Classic due to the lack of runes caused by the absence of the runecrafting skill. Because of this, runes are high priced and training can be very expensive.Drains Quests Trivia See also Blue Dragon  Blue dragons are the weakest type of dragon in RuneScape Classic, and they are popular for training combat among high-levelled players because of their dragon bones. They can be found within the Taverley dungeon, Ogre Enclave and in the basement of the Heroes' Guild. To train at the Heroes' Guild, you will need to have completed the Hero's Quest. Blue dragons that are found in the Ogre Enclave are only accessible during Watchtower quest. The cave entrance to the enclave gets walled in after the quest.Equipment  These dragons are powerful. It is suggested that you either bring good food, or use Paralyze Monster. If you plan to train in the Taverley dungeon, it is suggested that you bring restore prayer potions so that you can replenish your Prayer points. However, if you plan to train on the blue dragons beneath the Heroes' Guild, you will not need these potions, as there is an altar on the top floor of the guild.
