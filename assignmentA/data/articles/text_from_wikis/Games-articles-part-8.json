{"EarthBound Wiki": "EarthBound Wiki Giygas  Giygas, also known as Giegue (Japanese: \u30ae\u30fc\u30b0 Gyiyg), is the main antagonist in EarthBound Beginnings and EarthBound. Known as both the \"Embodiment of Evil\" and the \"Universal Cosmic Destroyer\", Giygas is an evil alien who, upon failing his original mission to reclaim the knowledge of PSI from humans, intends to sentence all of reality to the horror of infinite darkness. With an army of Starmen, Octobots and other deadly war machines, Giygas also uses his immense power to influence certain Earthlings to assist him, such as Pokey Minch and Geldegarde Monotoli. His influence also causes animals and people to become violent and distressed. He belongs to a race of aliens who originally had the power of PSI and, for unknown reasons, abducted humans in the 1900s and 198X. In EarthBound, most of Giygas's operations take place in the city of Fourside.In EarthBound Beginnings  Eighty years later, the invasion begins, and Giygas is confronted by the great-grandson of Maria and George, Ninten, and his companions. Giygas's influence is seen across the land as inanimate objects come to life, animals turn vicious and strange aliens begin to inhabit the earth. During the final confrontation, Giygas, still hurt by the loss of Maria, offers Ninten to come with him back to his home planet. Ninten declines this offer, and Giygas continues to attack. Ninten and his friends quickly prove no match for Giygas; they resort to singing a lullaby once shared between Maria and Giygas, and the comforting memories he had suppressed weaken Giygas. His guilt and love for Maria distress him and he is forced to surrender and retreat, but not before promising Ninten that he will return.In EarthBound  Giygas returns to Earth many years later in 199X as the primary antagonist of EarthBound, though he vastly differs from his appearance in EarthBound Beginnings. Ten years in the future, Giygas has taken over the Earth and sent all in it to darkness. He discovers the Apple of Enlightenment which prophecizes his defeat at the hands of Ness and so travels back into the past in order to stop Ness. In the present day, his influence is spreading over Eagleland, in particular to Ness's neighbor Pokey Minch. Pokey becomes one of Giygas's main agents in the attack against Ness, aided by his jealousy of Ness. Giygas, already unstable from his guilt surrounding the loss of Maria, exerts such tremendous evil power that it destroys his entire being, including his mind, causing him to become undefinable by human standards. As such, Giygas manifests as what can only be described as pure evil; in Pokey Minch's words, \"he is the Evil Power\". Due to the loss of his mind, Giygas becomes irrational and incapable of thought. To rectify this, Pokey seals him in the Devil's Machine so that his power would be contained and his mind kept intact. In the final battle, Pokey attests that Giygas isn't aware of himself or what he is doing, referring to him as \"an all-mighty idiot\". Now wielding a vast cosmic power which he is unable to control, Giygas becomes a threat to the existence of the universe itself. To stop him, one of the only known beings who manage to escape destruction in the future, an alien insect named Buzz Buzz, travels back to 199X. Buzz Buzz warns Ness of the impending catastrophe. Ness is given the Sound Stone and instructed to record the Eight Melodies in order to gain the power of Earth and be strong enough to face Giygas. Giygas's influence is further seen throughout the world, mainly in the form of enemies that Ness encounters. Now existing as the whole of evil power in the universe, Giygas is able to manipulate the evil in the minds of living beings, both human and animal, and can apparently manipulate even the forms of inanimate objects. Ness and his friends, known in prophecy as the Chosen Four, are forced to abandon their bodies and travel into the past in order to attack Giygas in The Cave of the Past. In the final battle, Giygas is held within the Devil's Machine, which was created to contain Giygas's tremendous power. During the battle, Pokey shuts the machine off, causing all of Giygas's power to be unleashed; the event surrounds the four children in a chaotic, bizarre dimension of darkness. His attacks are random and incomprehensible, and his speech is erratic and mindless. Although Giygas was too powerful for Ness and his friends to overcome by fighting, he is eventually defeated after Paula calls out to the people of Earth to Pray (including the player), and the combined prayers reach Giygas and exploit his weakness, the same human emotion that weakened him in EarthBound Beginnings. He breaks up and is reduced to nothingness, and his apocalyptic future is erased. The five phases of the battle are:Conception  In an interview about Giygas's appearance in EarthBound, Shigesato Itoi revealed that while Giygas is mostly something that can not be made sense of, a part of it is \"like a living being that deserves love. That part is the breast of Hisako Tsukuba from \u201cThe Military Policeman and the Dismembered Beauty\u201d. \"The Military Policeman and the Dismembered Beauty\" (\u61b2\u5175\u3068\u30d0\u30e9\u30d0\u30e9\u6b7b\u7f8e\u4eba \"Kenpei to Barabara Shibijin\") is a 1957 adult film that Shigesato Itoi accidentally saw as a child when he walked into the wrong theater, confusing a lovemaking scene that becomes a murder as rape. In fact, Itoi is incorrect about several details from the scene: he says that \"When the guy grabbed her breast really hard, it got distorted into this ball shape. It all hit me really hard. It was a direct attack to my brain.\" despite the fact that this does not actually occur, and Itoi admitted that his memories of that scene were \"fuzzy at best\". However, from his memories of the scene, he added \"this sense of terror having atrocity and eroticism side-by-side, and that\u2019s what Giygas's lines at the end are. During the end, he says, \u201cIt hurts,\u201d right? That's... her breast. It\u2019s like, how do I put it, a \u201cliving-being\u201d sensation.\" Giygas's dialogue was created by both himself and a staff member Matchan Miura. Since Itoi did not know how to use computers at this time, the two of them would sit alone in a room with Itoi speaking the dialogue one Japanese letter at a time and Matchan typing in on the computer and it being displayed in hiragana. Itoi would then look at the screen and give Miura instructions on what to change, and a section would be finished once Itoi was impressed and they both were almost in tears.Theories  For many years, fans have debated and created multiple theories concerning Giygas. Two theories have achieved widespread acknowledgment and have been of popular debate. The following are three theories.Trivia Main Page Pokey Minch  Porky Minch(\u30dd\u30fc\u30ad\u30fc\u30fb\u30df\u30f3\u30c1), also known as Pokey Minch in EarthBound, is the secondary antagonist of EarthBound and the main antagonist of Mother 3, but also appears non-canonically in Super Smash Bros. Brawl. A portly and distasteful boy, he is Ness's neighbor in the suburbs of Onett, the son of Aloysius Minch and Lardna Minch, and the older brother of Picky Minch. Porky's family acts bitter towards Ness's, because his father, Aloysius Minch, loaned a few hundred thousand dollars to Ness's father (though Aloysius admits it could have been a lot less), and was never repaid. Porky and his father later on found work in Fourside as consultants for the city's mayor. Porky's battle music in EarthBound is known to fans as \"Cease to Exist\" in Japan, and \"Pokey Means Business\" elsewhere, but no official name for the track exists. His themes in Mother 3 are \"Master Porky's Theme\" and \"Absolutely Safe Capsule\", and are played during the initial confrontations with him and following his retreat into the Absolutely Safe Capsule, respectively.Biography In EarthBound  At the beginning of EarthBound, Porky lives with his parents, Aloysius and Lardna, and his younger brother Picky in the house next door to Ness's. He likes to play practical jokes, and Shigesato Itoi has stated that he does not have any friends and therefore likely played only with Ness most of the time. When a Meteorite lands north of their houses in Onett, Porky and Picky sneak out of their house to investigate. When Picky turns up missing, Porky turns to Ness, pleading him to help him find his younger brother, afraid to go alone. After sweet-talking Ness's mother and convincing Ness to help him, they head off to look for Picky. At the meteorite landing site, Ness, Porky, and Picky meet Buzz Buzz, an alien from ten years in the future. Porky learns of the impending destruction of the universe at the hands of Giygas, but convinces himself that he is not one of the heroes that the alien speaks of. On the way back home, they are confronted by one of Giygas's underlings, Starman Junior. Porky cowers in fear while Ness and Picky assist Buzz Buzz in defeating the alien. After Ness escorts Porky and Picky safely home, Porky isn't seen again for some time. Porky first resurfaces as a high priest of the Happy Happyist cult, led by Carpainter. Porky kidnaps Paula with the intention of performing a human sacrifice. After Ness rescues Paula, Porky appears and orders two of the cult's followers and a Spiteful Crow to attack them. After the cult is disbanded, he tries to befriend Ness again, only to run off, revealing that he was lying (in the Japanese version, Ness's \"silent protagonist\" status mistakenly gives the impression of harsh shunning, thus causing an insulted Porky to sever all ties with Ness and abandon him). Porky and his father are later seen working as business consultants for Fourside's mayor Geldegarde Monotoli. He uses the money to live a luxurious life, but he eventually steals Monotoli's helicopter after Monotoli is confronted by Ness. Following this, Porky is not seen again onscreen until the end of the game, although his tracks can still be followed throughout the journey; his helicopter is shown to have crashed in the Deep Darkness, for instance. Nevertheless, Porky still causes trouble for Ness behind the scenes: it is revealed that Porky stole the first Phase Distorter in order to escape to The Cave of the Past, and has apparently played a part in strengthening Giygas's power. Porky finally reappears as Giygas's right-hand subordinate within the Cave of the Past, his skin pale and discolored, piloting an organic, spider-like machine. At this point, Porky reveals to Ness his true allegiance, taunting Ness and his companions before attacking them alongside Giygas. Once Giygas is destroyed, Porky uses time travel to escape into another era, but not before taunting Ness one last time. His final lines of dialogue in the game come through Picky in a suspicious hate letter that says, \"Come and get me, loser! Spankety spankety spankety!\"In Mother 3  Throughout most of Mother 3, Porky's presence is never explicitly mentioned, though it is implied. In the fan translation, he switches over to his Japanese name, \"Porky\", to better fit in with the pig theme of his affiliations, as well as to match the numerous graphical assets in the game boldly displaying his name in English text. As early as Chapter 4, there are references to \"King P\", such as a mention in the DCMC song title. Throughout the game, there are also references to \"Pork\" in different scenarios, such as \"Pork Troopers\" or \"Bag of Pork Chips\". In the Thunder Tower in Chapter 5, Porky's playroom is visited, with numerous references to EarthBound in it, though it is merely talked about as \"the King's playroom\". There is also a sold out sign in the Chimera Laboratory for a creature called PORKY 08. Finally, at the end of Chapter 7, it is clearly stated that the King is indeed Porky, and Lucas and his friends are brought to his city of New Pork City. Here, Porky's presence is emphasized, with many statues and dolls of him appearing, as well as a theater that shows pictures from EarthBound. The aforementioned playroom and Leder's speech, as well as the appearance of the Porky idols, imply that Porky is somehow still a child in the time. Throughout the Empire Porky Building, Porky taunts Lucas and co. through his intercom. When the top of the tower is finally reached, Porky himself appears, looking only slightly older than his EarthBound self. He then asks the player if they want to befriend him, but once they answer, he explodes, revealing himself to only be a robot version of Porky. Several other Mecha-Porkies join, battling Lucas all at once. When this is over, the actual Porky arrives in a new, fully-inorganic machine. However, his appearance has changed significantly; he has become extremely old and frail, coughing in nearly every sentence, as a result of his misuse of time travel. He explains how his servant is about to pull the final needle, and that there is nothing Lucas company can do about it. After that, he leaves in a shortcut to the location. Porky soon confronts them in a large spider mecha near the final battle location. Throughout the battle, he reveals that he has learned PSI, being able to perform inexplicable attacks much like Giygas could. During the battle, he explains that due to time travel, he has become immortal, as well as unkillable, stressing that when the Dark Dragon is awakened, only he and the Dragon will be the only ones left so that everyone who does not like him will be gone, and that he is prepared for such a fate. When he sees he is to be defeated, he calls upon the Absolutely Safe Capsule and climbs inside. It seals Porky inside, and being true to its name, it protects Porky from all harm. However, Porky finds that he cannot harm the heroes, either. When the battle ends, Dr. Andonuts reveals that he built the Absolutely Safe Capsule with the specifications that once someone is inside, the machine cannot be opened by anyone, including the person inside of it. So while Pokey is indeed \"absolutely safe\", he is trapped in the machine forever, doomed to spend eternity in isolation. Andonuts even feels sympathy for the tyrant, as in his own words, \". . . All he can do now is spend eternity inside the capsule, in absolute safety.\" Shigesato Itoi has confirmed this by stating that because of this, Porky will still be alive 5.5 billion years from now . At the end of the game, when the player is traveling in the darkness, they come into contact with an object that rolls with glee. While they may not be able to tell what it is, it is most likely Porky having survived the destruction of the land, as the Pigmask theme plays when you touch it. It is possible that he actually felt better after the events that took place.Personality  Porky Minch is shown to be very immature and childish, even when his body ages beyond his own measure. He can often be obnoxious, and is also shown to be very selfish and egotistical, which Shigesato Itoi says is likely due to how terrible and abusive his parents were. Porky does not appear to be self-conscious about his weight, or his resemblance to a pig (as King P, the naming of virtually every facet of his empire refers to pigs, such as the Pigmask Army, and New Pork City). Though he is naturally mischievous, after Porky is corrupted by Giygas, his childish sense of humor becomes increasingly malicious. He actively abets the destruction of the universe in EarthBound, and in Mother 3 his antics nearly wipe out the Nowhere Islands, ruining and even ending the lives of an untold number of the island's inhabitants, particularly Hinawa and Claus. Porky's actions were more than likely due to wanting friendship, according to Shigesato Itoi, and that Porky himself is like a poem.In Super Smash Bros. Brawl  Porky Minch also appears in the adventure mode of Super Smash Bros. Brawl, The Subspace Emissary, as a boss. Here, he is seen as a high-ranked member of the Subspace Army who attacks Lucas in The Ruined Zoo using his Pig King Statue and a fleet of Primids. Before the Statue can kill Lucas, Porky's \"best friend\"\u00a0Ness appears and destroys the Statue with PK Flash. From the exploding Statue emerges Porky in his Mother 3 spider mech, but he is quickly defeated by Ness and Lucas in a boss battle. Once Porky is defeated, Ness and Lucas celebrate, but not for very long, as Wario soon arrives to turn Ness back into a trophy. Porky Minch also appears as a sticker. Attaching this sticker to the bottom of Ness or Lucas's trophies in The Subspace Emissary increases their PK attack by 15. In this appearance he is referred to \"Porky\", a more proper translation of his name, even on the label for his sticker, which uses his EarthBound clay model for the image. It was most likely changed for this game because of his pig-themed empire in Mother 3, as well as all the signs saying \"PORKY\" in New Pork City, akin to the reasoning for his naming choice in the Mother 3 fan translation.Trivia  Obviously, Porky does not assist Ness in battles.List of Quotes EarthBound Mother 3 References Ness  Ness (\u30cd\u30b9, Ness) is the silent main protagonist of EarthBound and is analogous to Ninten and Lucas in their respective games. He greatly enjoys baseball; not only are most of his weapons various types of baseball bats, but he can also equip several baseball caps. In the EarthBound Player's Guide, he is said to wear a special baseball cap with his favorite team's logo on the front. He has a pet dog named King, a younger sister named Tracy, and two parents.Appearance  Ness has a strange resemblence to Ninten; he wears the exact same cap, shirt, and pants. The only differences are that the blue flap on his cap is on the right side instead of the left side, he wears white socks instead of red, and wears red-white shoes. He also wears a brown-white backpack. He has black eyes like Ninten, but unlike him, he just has circle eyes, that are purple-blueish, as seen in Super Smash Bros. Brawl.Biography  At the beginning of EarthBound, Ness is awoken from a sound sleep by the impact of a meteorite north of his house in Onett. His mother and sister are agitated, but Ness leaves to find out what happened. After meeting up with Lier X. Agerate and his next-door neighbor, Pokey Minch, he returns home and tries to get back to sleep. Soon thereafter, Pokey arrives and demands that Ness help him look for his little brother, who has gone missing during the calamity surrounding the impact. After a pep-talk from his mother, Ness, Pokey, and King go back out to the hillside, where they find Picky (who reveals it was Pokey who actually ran away). They also encounter Buzz-Buzz, an insectoid warrior who has returned from the future to warn Ness of the threat that Giygas poses to the universe. It is from Buzz-Buzz that Ness learns of the prophecy surrounding his future; that he, along with the help of two other boys and one girl, will stand against Giygas and save the universe from total annihilation. Vested with this knowledge, Ness accompanies Pokey and Picky back to their home but is assaulted by a Starman Jr. The alien confirms the prophecy before attacking the group. It is defeated through Buzz-buzz's massive PSI powers and Ness' physical attacks. Upon arriving at Pokey's house, Buzz-buzz is unceremoniously killed (for his alleged resemblance to a dung beetle) by Lardna Minch. Before expiring, Buzz-buzz passes on the Sound Stone to Ness and starts him on his quest to save the world. In the town of Onett, Ness first unlocks the power of Giant Step after tangling with Frank Fly and the Sharks. However, Captain Strong and the Onett Police Force are not happy with Ness investigating private property and ambush him at the police station. They back off and give him way to Twoson after he bests them in a fight.\u00a0 In Twoson, Ness is telepathically contacted by Paula, another member of his party, who asks him to come and rescue her. Learning her whereabouts from Everdred, a friendly gangster, Ness finds his way through\u00a0Peaceful Rest Valley to Happy Happy Village, which is under the spell of the Happy Happyist Cult. He finds Paula locked in a cell in a hidden house. She gives Ness the Franklin Badge so that he can withstand the lightning attacks of\u00a0Mr. Carpainter, the Happy Happyist leader. Ness confronts Carpainter and defeats him, thereby breaking the spell of Happy Happyism over the valley. Though he blames a certain statue, Carpainter thanks, Ness and gives him the key to Paula's cell. Ness frees Paula but encounters Pokey outside. Pokey reveals that he was the high priest behind the Happy Happyist threat and escapes, vowing to return. Ness and Paula gain the power of Lilliput Steps from the nearby cave.\u00a0 They then find way to Threed after assisting the Runaway Five, a famous jazz band, in escaping a debt at the Twoson theater. The Runaway Five take them there in their van and drop them off. Ness and Paula quickly discover the town is under an awful curse and zombies run rampant. They try to fight the zombies but are lured into a trap and locked in an underground cell. Paula contacts Jeff telepathically. He arrives in a flying capsule and unlocks the cell door with a special invention. The three of them conspire with the townsfolk to trap the zombies in the circus tent with flypaper. They then find a secret exit in the back of the graveyard and venture forth to find the source of the zombie scourge.\u00a0 Following the cave, they come upon Saturn Valley, which is under the threat of Master Belch, who not only has dominion of the zombies, but has kidnapped many innocent residents of the valley. They infiltrate a secret base behind a waterfall near the valley and encounter Belch. Playing on his obsession with fly honey, they easily defeat him and free the Saturn Valley inhabitants, gaining the power of Milky Well in the process.\u00a0 Their mission in Saturn Valley completed, they go back to Threed, which is now back to normal, and take the bus to Fourside. Unfortunately, they run into bad traffic in the desert and are forced to abandon the bus and conclude the journey on foot. Arriving in Fourside, they find the Runaway Five has fallen into debt with the city theater yet again. Ness and the gang assist in digging for treasure in a mine in the desert and repay the theater proprietor on behalf of the band. Later on, while shopping in the Fourside Department Store, there is a sudden power failure and Paula is snatched away in the dark. Hearing a call on the intercom, Ness and Jeff go to an office on the top floor where they fight and defeat the Department Store Spook. Looking for clues to Paula's disappearance at Jackie's Cafe, Ness and Jeff unexpectedly stumble upon a fantastical alternate dimension called Moonside. Navigating the oppositely-oriented domain, they discover the Mani Mani statue to be the cause and destroy it, to find that they have been in the storeroom to Jackie's Cafe all along. At the advisement of the Apple Kid, they visit a mysterious man who lives among monkeys in the desert named Talah Rama. He gives them a vital trout yogurt machine. Ness and Jeff use the yogurt dispenser to bribe a maid to let them into the Monotoli Building in Fourside, where Paula is apparently being held. With some unexpected help from the Runaway Five, Ness and Jeff make it to Mayor Monotoli's room where they rescue Paula. Monotli apologizes to them for kidnapping Paula but offers them use of his helicopter to travel to Summers. Unfortunately, Pokey who has been working as a consultant for Monotoli and orchestrated Paula's kidnapping steals the helicopter and flies away, taunting and sneering at Ness. \u00a0 The Runaway Five take them back to Threed where they repair Jeff's flying machine and fly to Winters, leaving Eagleland to rendezvous with his father. While Dr. Andonuts remodels the Sky Runner, they find their way to Rainy Circle with the help of the dungeon architect,\u00a0Brick Road. Afterward, they fly to Summers in the Sky Runner. While in Summers, they visit Club Stoic and Ness chats with a woman who shows him some magic cake. After taking a bite, he falls into a slumber and sees a vision of a foreigner from Dalaam named Poo, the fourth and final member of his party. After passing the final test in his training, Ness regains consciousness and Poo teleports to the group. Poo suggests they visit the Summers Cultural Museum, where they find a hidden exhibit that gives an odd clue about the Sphinx in Scaraba. As they are leaving they get a call from Mr. Spoon at the Fourside Dinosaur Museum meant for the museum proprietor. At the Dinosaur Museum they find a pothole in the back, leading through the sewers of Fourside to Magnet Hill, in the middle of the city. Here Ness picks up a Carrot Key, which he uses to find Pink Cloud in Dalaam. They return to Summers and find passage to Scaraba. By activating a set of buttons in front of the Sphinx, Ness and company journey into a pyramid to find the Hawk Eye. With some help from Dungeon Man, they find passage through a dark mire into the Deep Darkness. After the group combats the enemies in the gloomy swamp, including Master Barf, they find Tenda Village and its overly shy residents. Ness then receives a harried phone call from the Apple Kid in Dr. Andonuts' lab, but the line is cut off unexpectedly. The group investigates the deserted lab in Winters and finds clues that point to Giygas' Stonehenge Base nearby. Navigating the base, Ness discovers Dr. Andonuts, Apple Kid, and several residents of Winters held captive in the deepest realms. Ness and the gang defeat a Starman DX for their freedom. The Apple Kid points Ness in the direction of the Onett Library, where he returned a book called \"Overcoming Shyness\". Ness retrieves the book and lends it to the Tendas, who soon become socially adept enough to direct Ness to Lumine Hall. Lumine Hall deposits them all in the dinosaur-infested Lost Underworld where they find the final Sanctuary location, Fire Spring. Ness loses consciousness after hearing the melody and wakes up in Magicant, the colorful, dreamy world of his mind. Ness encounters everyone he has met in his journey here. They direct him to the Sea of Eden, his central conscience, where he confronts his nightmare, the last force of evil in his heart. By eliminating any means that Giygas has of controlling him, Ness gains incredible power with the help of the Sound Stone. The last thing he hears is his own voice telling him to head to Saturn Valley. When Ness wakes up, he and his friends teleport to Saturn Valley to meet up with Dr. Andonuts. With the help of the Apple Kid, he has developed the Phase Distorter II after Pokey stole the original. It needs only one meteorite sample to function properly. Ness travels back to Onett, which is swarming with fierce enemies, for a piece of the meteorite. Ness and company make it back with the meteorite and travel in the Phase Distorter II to the determined location of Giygas's Lair. Ness and the others wind up in the Cave of the Past, but apart from the ruined Phase Distorter, find nothing. Dr. Andonuts and the Apple Kid arrive in the Phase Distorter III with news that Pokey has fled to the past. In order to pursue Pokey, the four of them must have their bodies and souls transferred to robotic bodies since organic matter cannot survive time travel. Even though there may be no going back to his body, Ness and his friends unhesitantly agree to the procedure and Dr. Andonuts sets to work. Now as robots, the four of them travel back in time and find Giygas's Lair with a deformed Pokey at his side. They learn that Giygas's power became too great for even his own mind to handle, Giygas now exists as a nearly omnipotent entity without thought or reason; an \"all-mighty idiot.\" After dealing with Pokey, they attempt to battle Giygas, but their attacks don't seem to be effective. As Giygas attacks them in ways they cannot comprehend, Paula prays with all her heart that someone lends them strength. As she does so, their acquaintances and friends from their journey return with prayers of their own and successfully help to vanquish Giygas. With one more useless insult, Pokey retreats to another time period. With the war against Giygas over, Ness' spirit, along with the others, leave their battered robot bodies and return to the present. Poo returns home, Jeff joins his father, and Ness walks Paula home at her request.In the Super Smash Bros. Series  Ness is a playable character in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, like all other installments so far. Ness's clay model also appears as a sticker in Super Smash Bros. Brawl based on his EarthBound clay model. Attaching this sticker to the bottom of Ness or Lucas's trophies in The Subspace Emissary increases their PK attack by 33. He is voiced by Makiko \u014cmoto.Relationships with other Party Members Paula  After being saved by Ness from cultists, the two become great friends. During the closing of EarthBound, Ness is asked to accompany Paula to her home, and her parents comment on a relationship between the two. Additionally, Ness's mother would ask about her addressing her as his girlfriend.Jeff Andonuts  Despite being accompanied by Jeff for the majority of the game and fighting alongside him, the two rarely interact. The two are known friends as stated by their first interaction.Poo  Poo is the last companion to join Ness on his journey. Slightly aloof due to his training, Poo is nevertheless a friend and stalwart companion.Trivia Mother 3  Mother 3 (Japanese: \u30de\u30b6\u30fc\u30b9\u30ea\u30fc Mother 3) is the third and final installment in the\u00a0Mother series. It was developed by HAL Laboratory, Inc., Nintendo, and Brownie Brown and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance on April 20, 2006. It has currently been released only in Japan. However, there have been multiple fan-made english translations of it. It was designed and directed by Shigesato Itoi, with music by Sh\u014dgo Sakai. Mother 3\u00a0tells the story of Lucas, a young boy, and his friends who journey the Nowhere Islands to save the islands from an invading army and its leader, who have been introducing new technology and infrastructure to the islands. Up until its release, the game remained near the top of Famitsu's most wanted games list. Immediately before its release, Mother 3 was the most wanted game in Japan according to Weekly Famitsu. The title began as a project titled \"EarthBound 64\", a direct sequel to the Mother series' second installment, EarthBound, for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. EarthBound 64 was in development for many years before the project was finally terminated on August 21, 2000, partially because of the Nintendo 64 Disk Drive's commercial failure. Mother 3 was announced in June 2003 during a Mother 1 + 2 television commercial. Although details of its development were kept secret, it has since been made known that EarthBound 64 was reworked into Mother 3. It was released for the Wii U Virtual Console on December 17th 2015, in Japan only. In 2006, EarthBound series creator, Shigesato Itoi, declared that there were no plans for further installments in the Mother series, and because no official English version has been announced, a fan translation was developed and released on October 17, 2008. Throughout the progress made on the project, Tomato and Jeffman were firm in stating that if Nintendo announced an official localization of Mother 3, they would immediately cease their work, indicating that their sole goal was to ensure that the game was translated to English. The president of Brownie Brown, Shinichi Kameoka, has stated that if they were requested to make a port of Mother 3 for worldwide audiences, they would happily do so.Gameplay  Mother 3 starts out very differently from the first two Mother games as is it divided up into eight different chapters, similar to Dragon Quest IV and StarTropics. Instead of focusing on a group of children, it chronicles the story and adventures of Lucas and his family, and the story switches perspective during each chapter. For example, the first half of the game is played as Flint, Duster, and Salsa, but the rest of the game is played as Lucas. The Nowhere Islands also change dramatically because of the influence of the Pigmask Army, transforming from a simple low-tech rural society to a more modern twenty-first century infrastructure that's similar to the first two Mother games (hence the game's theme of nature vs. technology). The game also features a more traditional top-down RPG perspective, instead of the oblique projection used in the first two games. Once again, the game retains the Dragon Quest-style battle system EarthBound Beginnings and EarthBound had (although this time at a much quicker pace), but Mother 3\u00a0adds an extra twist in the form of the music combo system. Depending on how well the player presses the A button in-sync to the lead enemy's \"theme\" (each enemy has their own respective beat, some even possessing variable tempos), he or she can perform up to 16 hits of damaging combos on the game's enemies. The game also has an option of letting the player practice music combos on enemies they have already fought, once they gain a certain item. Tempos can also be more easily heard in the form of a \"heartbeat\" when the enemy is asleep. Enemies are still visible on the field, and can still be approached from behind for a surprise attack (along with the extra added detail of seeing behind an enemy). The game also retains the rolling hit point (abbreviated as HP) and Psychic Points (abbreviated as PP) odometers from the previous game, enabling the player to heal before the counter rolls to zero. In Mother 3, the hit point odometer scrolls more slowly than the previous game and can be slowed further by defending \u2014 however, unlike EarthBound, characters will still collapse if their hit point odometer scrolls to zero. Another new addition is the ability to run, by holding and releasing the B button the player can not only reach areas quicker, but also smash into breakable objects and also stun enemies significantly weaker than the party, replacing the previous game's ability to instantly defeat weak enemies without entering battle. Mother 3 also abandons saving the game by phone in favor of Save Frogs, which are abundant and appear at various areas in the game. Currency, which does not come into play until Chapter 4, comes in the form of Dragon Power (abbreviated as DP), which the player can deposit or transfer from Save Frogs.Plot Characters  Unlike the first two games, the focus is no longer on a group of children. Some chapters put completely different characters in the protagonist role. In one chapter the player controls a limping thief named Duster; in another chapter the main character is Salsa, a monkey who is constantly suffering abuse by a rich traveling merchant named Fassad. The only child character the player gets to control is Lucas, who is about nine to ten years old in the first three chapters and twelve to thirteen years for the remainder of the game. Further controllable characters include Kumatora, a tomboyish princess, Flint, a strange middle-aged cowboy and Lucas's father, and Lucas's dog, Boney.Setting & Premise  Mother 3 is set in the Nowhere Islands, some unknown amount of years after EarthBound. Chaos ensues after an invasion by the Pigmask Army, named after the uniforms, which resemble pigs, and its leader, Porky Minch, the \"Pig King\". They slowly construct a police state, while experimenting on the land's flora and fauna, and introducing new technology and infrastructure to the islands. The various chapters record the life of a boy named Lucas and his family and friends, banding together to rid the Nowhere Islands of the Pigmask Army. True to the game's slogan \"Strange, Funny and Heartrending\", Mother 3 sheds the more lighthearted and quirky plot lines of the previous games in favor of a far darker and more emotional story. The plot involves quite a few tragic and saddening events. However, the game still retains many humorous and bizarre elements that are common to the series.Story  The game opens with a preliminary sequence showing Hinawa visiting her father, Alec, with her twin sons, Claus & Lucas. After her sons play-fight with some Dragos, Hinawa writes a letter to her husband, Flint, stating that she expects to be returning home to Tazmily Village sometime soon. After sending the letter, she hears a strange anthem being played by an unseen flying object, foreshadowing the rest of the story...Chapter 1: Night of the Funeral  The game then switches to Flint's perspective. Late one night, the Sunshine Forest is set on fire by a group of strange people in pig-like masks. Thomas, the fireman of the nearby rural village of Tazmily, rushes to Flint's house and tries to wake him up, breaking the doorknob off the latter's front door in the process. Thomas forces Flint to head into the forest to rescue Lighter and Fuel, who are still trapped in the fire. Flint & Thomas eventually find Lighter, but he had sustained several injuries, apparently from trying to fight the swarm of bugs nearby. The bugs appear to be responsible for the fire, as when Flint confronts them himself, they repeatedly attack by shooting flames from their proboscises. After defeating the swarm, Flint rescues Fuel, who became trapped in his burning house, and was only saved seconds before it collapsed. After reuniting Fuel with Lighter, Tazmily experiences its first rainstorm in \"a while\", putting out the fire; however, the residents of Tazmily realize that Hinawa still hasn't come home, and organize a search party for her. During the search, Flint hears from Isaac that earlier, he thought he saw Hinawa, then heard a Drago's roar, followed by bloodcurdling screams. Issac nervously grows skeptical about this, while Flint later receives the letter Hinawa sent at the end of the prologue. Eventually, Jonel comes across a plateau that appears to have been gashed at by a Drago. This fact worries him, as Dragos are peaceful creatures; even more worrying is the sight of a red scrap of cloth hanging on a tree branch. Seeking to scale the plateau, Flint employs the help of Duster, a skillful adventurer handicapped by a distinctive limp. Using his Wall Staples, Duster forms a ladder to scale the plateau, with Flint taking the lead. Flint then further examines the scrap of cloth on the tree, and finds that the cloth is identical in color to Hinawa's dress. However, his concern is interrupted by the sight of the strange pig-like people who set the forest on fire earlier. The pig-like people react by sending a cybernetic caribou after them. Upon the caribou's defeat, the pig-like people flee, dropping a notebook detailing their plans to \"improve\" the wildlife by taking them apart and fusing them with either cybernetic modifications or parts of other living creatures: a plan dubbed the \"Fascinating Chimera Project\". Flint tucks away the notebook and returns to the village, where Tessie announces that Claus & Lucas were found in the river and are drying by a nearby campfire. However, this period of relief is short-lived, as Bronson suddenly arrives with \"some good news...and...some bad news.\" The good news is that Bronson managed to find a severed Drago Fang, and that it could make a great weapon. The bad news, however, is where he found the fang: \"It was pierced through [Hinawa's] heart.\" Hinawa's murder shocks everyone, but especially devastates Flint, who assaults his peers in a blind rage before being knocked unconscious by Lighter. After dreaming about the last time he saw Hinawa alive (when she left to visit her father on Mt. Oriander), Flint wakes up to find that he is the first prisoner of Tazmily Village's jail. Bronson explains that everyone understands Flint's grief and why he went on a rampage last night, but also admonishes Flint for his poor method of coping with the stress of his wife's murder. Bronson asks Flint to see him once he gets out of jail, as the former managed to fashion the Drago's Fang into an effective weapon. Flint is then visited by Claus, who leaves him an apple with a Hand File tucked into the core. Claus boasts that he'll become strong enough to take on the Drago that killed Hinawa, then leaves without finishing his last sentence. Flint then finds the Hand File in the apple and uses it to break open the rusted lock on the jail cell's door before heading off to Hinawa's wake. There, Alec forces Lucas to reveal that Claus stole Flint's kitchen knife and ran off to the Drago Plateau to avenge Hinawa. Lucas runs away out of shame, as he let Claus go do something that would likely get him killed, and Alec instructs Flint to meet him at his home on Mt. Oriander. Once the two men meet up, they head off to the house of Aeolia, the leader of the six Magypsies: gender-less, effeminate humanoids with special abilities. Aeolia and the Magypsies reveal that Claus visited them on his trek to Drago Plateau, and was granted a special power by them for combat. Knowing this, Flint & Alec head off to the Drago Plateau to find Claus. While scaling the Drago Plateau, Flint & Alec come across several more of the pig-like people who've been recently terrorizing Tazmily Village, and later find a baby Drago playing with a shoe that is unmistakably Claus's. Travelling further, they find Claus's other shoe, and with it, a cybernetic Drago short one fang: the fang that killed Hinawa. Recognizing his wife's murderer, Flint pierces the Drago's hide with its own fang, and fights it until it collapses. However, Alec stops Flint from killing the Drago when its child intervenes, stating that killing the Drago will only throw its child into the same world of grief as Claus & Lucas. However, Alec's words are futile, as the Drago succumbs to its injuries anyways. Flint & Alec then head back to Tazmily Village as the camera pans below the plateau. A body is seen lying face-down, seemingly dead from an apparent fall. It is Claus.Chapter 2: Thief Adventure  The story then switches to Duster's perspective, beginning when he consoles Flint after the latter escapes from jail. The following night, Duster is tasked by his father, Wess, to infiltrate the abandoned Osohe Castle and recover a very important item from it. Taking a series of useful tools with him, Duster heads to the castle, running into a suspicious peddler and his pet monkey along the way. Duster also encounters Butch the farmer, who offered some pigs to the peddler in exchange for a bag full of strange stuff called \"money\". Upon reaching the cemetery, he is briefly attacked by the undead and animate gravestones before successfully infiltrating Osohe Castle. Inside the castle, Duster encounters hordes of ghosts; many of them are quite hostile, though some are actually friendly. Venturing further into the castle, Duster sees a strange girl pass him by, dropping a shining pendant along the way. Duster takes the pendant and fights a ghostly orchestra conductor before finding the Noble Spitoon, which he believes to be the item that Wess was asking for. Duster takes the spitoon and heads back home. However, when the spitoon is presented to Wess, he shatters it in rage, scolding Duster for bringing him the wrong item. Just as he loses faith in his son, Wess notices the pendent that the latter picked up during the previous mission. Wess tells Duster of its importance, and joins him to infiltrate Osohe Castle a second time the following morning. However, their endeavors are complicated by the pig-like people, who are also searching for Wess's very important item. The pig-like people send an electric-powered clay golem after them, but Wess & Duster are able to fight it off until it collapses. The pig-like people, unable to reactivate the golem, retreat. Making their way further into the castle, Wess & Duster are nearly hit with a blast of PK Freeze, and meet the strange girl Duster met before: Kumatora, the tomboy \"princess\" of Osohe Castle. Kumatora begins trusting Wess & Duster after they free her from a bear trap, and begins joining them on their journey for Wess's very important item. Along the way, they find a balcony looking out to the castle's courtyard. In the middle of the courtyard is a glowing, golden needle; Wess explains that when he asked King Osohe about it, the latter gravely stated that it was of no importance. Though Wess seems to be aware that the King was lying about the needle, he dismisses it, as it is not his very important item. Eventually, Wess, Duster, and Kumatora find a room containing the Egg of Light (also referred to as the \"Hummingbird Egg\"): Wess's very important item. However, the pig-like people reach them as well, and are attempting to break down the door with more clay golems. Kumatora hastily takes the Egg of Light, only to open a trap-door that drops her, Wess, and Duster into a pool below the castle. There, they face off against a gigantic snake before being abruptly drained out of the castle. Upon recovering, Kumatora & Wess discover that Duster isn't with them, and go through town to find him. At the town square, however, they are confronted by Butch, who accuses Wess & Duster of stealing the \"money\" that he hid in the well. Kumatora tries to defend the pair, scaring Butch in the process, before Flint steps in and urges everyone to hold their hysteria until Duster returns.Chapter 3: The Suspicious Peddler  The story then switches perspectives yet again, this time focusing on a monkey who was poached from the wild some unknown time ago, along with his girlfriend. The monkey is forced to work for Fassad Yokuba, one of the highest-ranking members of the Pigmask Army. The Pigmasks, named for their pig-like outfits, had previously set fire to a forest near a rural village and began their \"Fascinating Chimera Project\" by converting a caribou and a Drago into cybernetic chimeras. However, the Drago ended up escaping, and the Pigmasks are unable to figure out what happened to it. Nevertheless, the Pigmasks decide to continue their missions across the Nowhere Islands. Chapter 3 begins with a Pigmask airship landing in the Death Desert, a desolate area full of dangerous animals. Fassad forces his captured monkey to work for him, in exchange for the life of the monkey's girlfriend. Naming the monkey \"Salsa\", Fassad equips him with a shock collar that can be activated at the push of a button, for disciplinary use. Grudgingly, Salsa treks through the desert until provoking and defeating a Cactus Wolf, at which point Fassad opens a secret underground passage. The passage ends up leading to a graveyard in a rural village called \"Tazmily\". The town is caught in a state of grief following the death of one of their residents, who was murdered by a hostile Drago. Arriving at night, Fassad & Salsa make their way to the town before bumping into a limping, bad-breathed bum. They also overhear a conversation between the bum and a man who previously gave Fassad some pigs in exchange for money. Fassad learns that the latter man hid his money in the town's well, and takes back the money, knowing that it'll cause an upset in the town. He then decides to stay the night in the town's inn, learning (to his surprise) that the town lacks a monetary system. The next morning, Fassad gathers the townspeople and delivers an elaborate propaganda speech: he states that the world around us has fallen into a state of peril, citing the Pigmasks's acts of terror upon Tazmily Village, and explains that the only way to reclaim peace and happiness is to install Happy Boxes in their homes. Gaining the public's attention, Fassad spreads Happy Boxes all over town, with Salsa stuck as the sole delivery person. Fassad later receives notice that the Pigmasks's raid of Osohe Castle, intended to obtain the Egg of Light, is being interrupted by a second group of amateur raiders. Knowing that the amateurs are in the basement, Fassad forces Salsa to drain the waters at the bottom of the castle, washing away the amateurs-- and the Egg of Light. Angered, Fassad goes back to the inn to stay the night. However, on his way there, he encounters a frenzy erupting in the town square: the man who sold Fassad his pigs is accusing a family in the town of stealing his money. Fassad takes the opportunity to continue his propaganda, while a strange girl in the crowd forms a telepathic connection with Salsa. The next night, Salsa awakes to hear a girl's voice: the same girl he met earlier. She frees him from Fassad's control, aided by an old man, by removing his shock collar and destroying the remote that activates the shocks. However, Fassad wakes up and confronts the group, forcing the latter to run into the forest. Despite their efforts, Salsa and co. are confronted by tanks and soldiers, and are eventually cornered. Right when Fassad prepares to arrest the rebellious group, a blond-haired kid walks on to the scene, along with a baby drago and its mother. At the kid's command, the adult Drago ravages the Pigmasks, forcing them to flee. The chapter ends with a foreshadowing of his future psychological growth.Chapter 4: Club Titiboo  Despite the Pigmasks's defeat at the end of Chapter 3, their influence has successfully spread throughout the Nowhere Islands as a result of the Happy Boxes, which are implied to have brainwashed their owners. The region has become highly modernized, to a point where it resembles America/Eagleland; it even now runs on a monetary system, utilizing a currency called \"Dragon Power\", or DP. Happy Boxes are commonplace in buildings, particularly in the now Onett-esque Tazmily Village, though buildings lacking Happy Boxes are inexplicably destroyed by lightning strikes, with Flint's house being a recurring target. The government also appears to be quite strict, arresting Wess and throwing him into a retirement home for protesting during one of Fassad's speeches. Citizens pledge allegiance to their great \"King P,\" and the Pigmasks hold militaristic, totalitarian law. However, a small group of people still remain skeptical of the new government, and will go on to rebel. The story continues three years after the events of Chapter 3, now taking its final change in perspective and focusing on Lucas; his viewpoint is where the rest of the game is focused. Still grieving his mother's death (albeit no longer publicly displaying it), he starts to grow suspicious after hearing of the appearance of an apparent doppelganger of Duster, who disappeared three years ago. Aided by his dog, Boney, he learns that the suspicious man in question is Lucky, the bassist for the DCMC, who regularly performs at Club Titiboo, near the Clayman Factory, where electrically-powered clay golems are manufactured & maintained. Since he cannot take the train, he travels to the factory through the tunnels; along the way, he runs into the Magypsy Ionia, who allows him to use the Magypsies's special ability: psionic powers, or PSI. Alongside these powers is tier \"\u03b1\" of PK Love, an immensely powerful PSI attack. A surprised Ionia explains that PK Love is a PSI that is hardly ever learned, and learned only by a select group of people. After travelling to the factory, Lucas learns that Club Titiboo is only accessible to factory employees, prompting him to take up a brief part-time job escorting worn-out Claymen to a recharging station. Eventually, Lucas gains access to the club, but is forced to go back due to the club's no-pets-policy... only to return with Boney disguised as a person. However, Lucas & Boney are still denied entrance, and are only admitted in at the recommendation of one of the waitresses, Violet, who claims that Lucas is the legendary Prince Poo. Once inside, Violet reveals to Lucas & Boney that she is actually a disguised Kumatora, who both aided Duster & Wess during their second raid of Osohe Castle and\u00a0connected with Salsa & spearheaded his escape. She promises to explain everything to them after the concert. Following the concert, Kumatora drags Lucas & Boney down a hidden passageway to one of the dressing rooms, where she explains that Lucky is actually an amnesic Duster, who disappeared from public view three years ago after hiding the Egg of Light. However, Kumatora also explains that she has trouble contacting him, as he is regularly kept under security due to his status as a celebrity. As a result, she asks Lucas & Boney to navigate Club Titiboo's attic and infiltrate Lucky's dressing room. After navigating the attic and disposing of the DCMC's sentient, retired, and vengeful bass, Lucas & Boney make it into Lucky's dressing room. There, the DCMC has gathered together, and Lucky reveals to Lucas that he hid the Egg of Light somewhere in the Unknown Valley, but is still trying to remember his true identity. Unable to choose whether to continue living as the DCMC's bassist or become \"Duster\" again and reclaim the egg, he places the decision in the hands of the band, who settle the decision via rock-paper-scissors. The entire band agrees on the fact that Lucky is destined to become Duster again, and utilize coincidence & deception to lose to Lucas on purpose. This convinces Lucky to call himself \"Duster\" again and search for the Egg of Light. Before leaving, he briefly re-lives how he became Lucky: after hiding the Egg and losing his memories, Duster was taken in by the DCMC, who gave him the pseudonym \"Lucky\" and hired him as his bassist. As Lucky, Duster consistently practiced the bass and became a famed member of the DCMC. Before leaving, Duster eavesdrops on the DCMC's first concert without him, where they sing farewell to their departed Lucky...Chapter 5: Tower of Thunder  Trekking through the Unknown Valley (and allowing Boney to remove his disguise), the group eventually comes across the inactive Clayman that Duster hid the Egg of Light in. However, a bolt of lightning supercharges the golem, causing it to get up and run off somewhere. Seeing the monster run off down the highway, Kumatora prompts everyone to go after it. While they follow the Clayman through a nearby warehouse, they are suddenly stopped by a group of Pigmasks. Apparently, Lucas bears a striking resemblance to the Pigmasks' commander-in-chief, to the point where the Pigmasks can't discern the two apart and believe that Lucas is the commander. After being dressed up into proper uniform, Lucas (in the commander's vest & trousers) and company (dressed in Pigmask uniforms) find the Egg-bearing Clayman being driven off to the dump, prompting the group to continue their search down the highway. During the chase, Lucas borrows a Pork Bean from a Pigmask and uses it to better their advantage in the chase. However, the vehicle ends up crashing after slipping on multiple banana peels, presumably dropped by Fassad. This catches the attention of the Pork Trooper, a higher-ranked Pigmask (who also attended the DCMC concert back in Chapter 4). He is eager to help out his \"allies\", but attacks them once his incredibly precise sense of smell allows him to tell them apart from his real comrades. During the fight, he is easily incapacitated by jealousy-- induced by Lucas & co. showing him DCMC merchandise-- and goes down swiftly. Vowing to return, he runs off, leaving behind his own Pork Bean for Lucas to take. Continuing further down the Highway, the group eventually reaches the municipal dump, where Claymen that can no longer function properly are deposited in heaps of clay. Among these heaps is the Clayman bearing the Egg of Light, but before Duster can reclaim it, some of the dump's discarded clay fuses with some other scrap to create a sentient pile of garbage. Lucas & co. manage to defeat this forlorn junk heap and take back the egg; the moment Duster picks it up, he regains all the memories he'd lost three years ago, allowing him to become the same Duster that fought the Reconstructed Caribou with Flint on the Drago Plateau, the same Duster that raided Osohe Castle twice, and the same Duster that was washed away, separated from his father & Kumatora, and hid the Egg of Light in an apparently dead Clayman before losing his memories. However, his celebration is cut short by the Pigmasks, who take the group over to the Thunder Tower. Lucas & co. climb up the tower, learning along the way that it was built for the purpose of destroying homes that refuse to install Happy Boxes by shooting bolts of electricity (this manages to explain the lightning strikes that have repeatedly plagued Lucas's home). After climbing high up the tower and defeating a better-equipped \"Fierce\" Pork Trooper, the group runs into none other than Fassad. He easily discerns Lucas as the blonde-haired kid who sent a Drago to drive off the Pigmasks at the end of Chapter 3, and chases him further up the tower. During Lucas & co's escape, they find their way into a strange playroom belonging to King P. Among other items are a casket from a foreign land, some teddy bears that don't look like they were used since the 1990's, and a jukebox (specifically one that would be better suited for a caf\u00e9 somewhere in a big city) that only plays a song suited for a department store. Climbing further up, Lucas gets struck by a faulty bolt of electricity from a disheveled part of the tower, allowing him to realize the power of PK Flash. He is then driven further up by Fassad, but not without taking the opportunity to destroy the tower's main generator, destroying the tower in turn. Forced onto the roof, Lucas & co. are left to die on the crumbling tower by Fassad. The latter then heads to the Pigmasks' mothership to escape, but a tremor causes him to slip on one of his discarded banana peels and fall to his death. Duster then seizes the opportunity to grab on to the mothership and follow it, with Lucas, Kumatora, and Boney hanging on to him. However, the ship shakes the group off, causing them to scatter about as the Pigmask's real commander-in-chief, a strange masked man, watches them...Chapter 6: Sunflower Fields  What sets Chapter 6 apart from others is its ambiguous setting: it is unknown if the field is where Lucas landed following his fall from the mothership in the previous chapter, or if this is just part of Lucas's imagination (as a form of him coping with Hinawa's death).Chapter 7: The Seven Needles  NOTE: This is one of the longest chapters in the game; as such, it will be divided into several sections based on the commonly-considered chronological order that the needles come into play; note that most of this chapter is non-linear. The first, sixth, and seventh needles must be pulled in the order that they are listed, while the second, third, fourth, and fifth needles can be pulled in any order.The First Needle  The chapter begins with Lucas & Boney waking up in a haystack just outside Tazmily's retirement home. Alec and Wess take Lucas & Boney into the home and explain that they had a dream where Hinawa told them to build a haystack at the exact spot that Lucas & Boney landed. Alec then asks about Duster's whereabouts, and suggests that Lucas see the Magypsies for help. After leaving the retirement home, Lucas hears a commotion nearby and finds Ionia, bound & gagged and left on the bridge. She takes Lucas & Boney upriver to Aeolia's house, where Ionia takes the liberty of freshening up. While Aeolia is talking with the others, a loud tremor occurs outside, and the sky repeatedly changes colors for a brief moment. Aeolia then realizes that she is dying; her needle has been pulled by someone, meaning that it is time for her to vanish from existence. With some parting words, she leaves behind a razor and some lipstick and uses the last of her remaining PSI to open up a secret passageway beneath her tea table. Lucas, Ionia, and Boney follow it to find that it ends at the courtyard of Osohe Castle, the resting place of Aeolia's Needle. There, the golden needle that was previously visible in Chapter 2 is gone, with a hole secreting purple smoke left in its wake. Lonia explains that the needle is one of seven that conceal a special power, only accessible once all seven are pulled. She fears the worst, believing that whoever pulled Aeolia's needle may have a dark heart, or no heart at all. Lonia provides an in-depth explanation on how the Seven Needles work: The needles can only be pulled by those who know the PK Love ability. When a needle is pulled, the puller passes their heart on to the Dark Dragon that sleeps beneath the Nowhere Islands. When all the needles are pulled, the dragon will awaken, and the result will either be beneficial (if the needles were pulled by a goodhearted person) or catastrophic (if the needles were pulled by a person with a dark heart); however, there is no telling what will happen if the needles were pulled by a heartless person. Ionia then leaves, asking Lucas to pull the rest of the needles before whoever pulled Aeolia's does, and Lucas finds a transceiver phone similar to Fassad's. Answering a call on it, Lucas learns that the next needle is near the Chimera Laboratory.The Second Needle  After returning to the surface via the Osohe Waterways, Boney drags Lucas to Hinawa's grave. There, Nippolyte the grave keeper is paying his respects to Hinawa. Upon noticing Lucas, he gives him the Courage Badge, saying that it is a present from Flint. Nippolyte also muses over how Hinawa's murder and Claus's disappearance has destroyed Flint's life: Flint's routine consists solely of mourning Hinawa, searching for Claus, mourning Hinawa, searching for Claus, etc. Lucas & Boney head off to find the Chimera Lab. At the Murasaki Forest, Lucas & Boney come across the Chimera Lab and infiltrate it by taking a part-time job there. Donning Pigmask helmets, the two are tasked with finding two monkeys due for experimentation that have escaped: Salsa & Samba. Taking the opportunity to explore the place, Lucas & Boney learn of the brutal practices that occur in the lab, several of which are eerily Mengele-esque. Eventually, the duo finds Salsa & Samba, but the latter run off after mistaking the former for Pigmasks. Meanwhile, the chimeras appear to have gone rogue, and Lucas & Boney are attacked by an unfinished, cybernetic lion chimera. After a Clayman incapacitates the lion, the lab hears news that the Ultimate Chimera has escaped and is terrorizing the workers. The Pigmasks explain that the Ultimate Chimera is unbeatable, and will instantly stalk anyone it sees, usually killing them with its powerful jaws and razor-sharp teeth. A state of emergency is declared in the lab as the Ultimate Chimera continues its massacre... Lucas & Boney continue searching for Salsa & Samba, while simultaneously trying to avoid the jaws of the Ultimate Chimera. Along the way, they see an old man hiding in a trash can. He introduces himself as Dr. Andonuts, and explains that he is being forced to work as the Pigmasks' chief technological developer. Previous details in the game show this his other inventions included the Claymen and the Instant Revitalizing Machines stationed in several locations. Later, Lucas & Boney manage to corner Salsa & Samba in the basement, but they escape and flee to the far-east room on the first floor. There, Lucas & Boney corner the monkeys again, but are cornered in turn by... the Ultimate Chimera. Fearing for their lives, Lucas & Boney flee, dropping their disguises and allowing Salsa to recognize Lucas as the blonde kid who, with the help of a Drago, freed him from Fassad and the Pigmasks three years ago. As Lucas & Boney try to stay alive, Dr. Andonuts reveals that he gave the Ultimate Chimera a precautionary weakness: the big red button on its back serves as a power switch for the chimera, which went rogue before the switch could be removed. As the Ultimate Chimera pounces at Lucas, Salsa suddenly jumps in and hits the switch, deactivating the chimera. With the threat incapacitated, Lucas & Boney go off to continue their original search for the second needle. However, as they leave, the yellow bird that rests on the Ultimate Chimera's head jumps down and presses the chimera's switch, re-activating the beast and allowing it to escape the lab and run off into the wild... Continuing onwards, Salsa uses one of his tricks to perform a special dance that allows him to open a previously-unopenable door for Lucas & Boney. Through it is the house of the Magypsy Doria, with an additional guest: Kumatora, who was taken in by Doria after falling from the mothership back in Chapter 5. Knowing that Lucas must be the one to awaken the Dark Dragon, she reveals that her needle is beneath the pond outside her house. With the help of Dr. Andonuts and a special chimera, Lucas is able to reveal the second needle. Meanwhile, Kumatora bids farewell to Salsa, who gives her a nut as a parting gift. With all his might, Lucas grasps the needle and tears it out of the earth, causing the same pseudo-apocalyptic phenomenon as when Aeolia's needle was pulled; Lucas also learns PK Love \u03b2 as an aftershock of the event. Doria disappears, and Lucas, Boney, and Kumatora continue searching for the rest of the needles.The Third Needle  After leaving Doria's house and defating an unruly mouse, Lucas & co. run into the Mole Cricket that play-fought with Lucas & Claus during their visit to Mt. Oriander at the very beginning of the game. He invites Lucas to a rematch in the Mole Cricket Hole. There, Lucas easily defeats the Mole Cricket and continues through the tunnel with his friends, eventually reaching the other side at Snowcap Mountain. There, Lucas & co. encounter Lydia, the Magypsy of Snowcap Mountain's needle. She invites the group in, where it is revealed that she is incredibly warmhearted to everyone-- even a stranded Pigmask Captain that remains in her home. Lydia state that her needle is behind her house. Hearing the sounds of Pigmask airships, Lucas & co. rush outside-- just in time to witness the pulling of Lydia's needle by the Pigmasks' commander-in-chief, the Masked Man. Lucas and the Masked Man form a telepathic connection with each other, revealing to Lucas that the Masked Man is a heartless being. The Masked Man departs, leaving the group to fight the Steel Mechorilla. After the Mechorilla's defeat, Lydia urges Lucas to be the one to awaken the Dark Dragon, and asks to check on the Pigmask Captain, then disappears into thin air like Aeolia & Doria. When leaving, the Pigmask Captain is seen tending for Lydia's pet rabbits in her absence. He is also unmasked, revealing that the Pigmasks are just regular people who've sworn their ultimate allegiance to the Pig King. Lucas, Kumatora, and Boney leave Snowcap Mountain and head back to Tazmily by launching a refrigerator off the top of the mountain. Landing in the cemetery, Lucas spots a strange jar that opens a peculiar nearby grave. Lucas & co. jump down the hole and continue their adventure. Meanwhile, people are leaving Tazmily in droves, heading off to seek better lives in the big city.The Fourth Needle  The hole leads to an underground tunnel, specifically the one used by Fassad to go from the Death Desert to Tazmily Village in Chapter 3; the entrance to the desert is closed. Lucas & co. follow the passageway until they find a strange coffee table that is actually a form of ground transport. The group rides the table down the highway until reaching the closed entrance to Thunder Tower. There, a previously-closed pathway is made accessible, leading to a strange area called Saturn Valley. The area is populated by a race of bizarre creatures called Mr. Saturns, who've been taken hostage by invading Pigmasks. The Pigmasks know that there is a needle nearby, and are torturing the Mr. Saturns via scary stories told by Frightbots. Among the Mr. Saturns is Duster, who was taken in by the Mr. Saturns following his fall in Chapter 5. Lucas, Kumatora, and Boney drive out the Pigmasks and free the Mr. Saturns & Duster. In return, the Mr. Saturns allow Lucas, Kumatora, Duster, and Boney to access Fire Mountain, where the fourth needle lies. At the base of Fire Mountain is the home of Phrygia, the sleeping Magypsy. Being mainly focused on beauty rest, she provides Lucas with some Encouraging Words to tell the boulders blocking the path to the mountain, so that the boulders will move out of the way; Lucas follows suit. With a clear path, Lucas and co. trek deeper into the mountain, facing numerous tough enemies along the way. At some point, they encounter a group of Pigmasks gossiping about how Fassad's \"changed\" since the events of Chapter 5. However, they notice Lucas and flee before they can divulge any more information. This piques curiosity, given the fact that Fassad apparently died after falling from Thunder Tower. This curiosity is answered once Lucas and co. reach the fourth needle: a voice shouts \"'I've found you! I've finally found you! Nwehehehehe!' is what Fassad says!\" Descending upon the group is Fassad, who actually survived his fall from Thunder Tower and was given cybernetic enhancements to ensure his survival. However, he is left unable to speak any known language, instead producing a distorted variation of the Magypsies' leitmotif; this forces him to travel with an interpreter, who translates his music into language. Fassad, now calling himself \"New Fassad\" in reference to his condition, divulges on the humiliation he suffered after falling from Thunder Tower. Swearing revenge, he suddenly attacks Lucas & co, presenting a truly difficult fight. However, New Fassad is eventually defeated, and flees while declaring that he will return. With all his might, Lucas pulls the fourth needle, prompting Phrygia to wake up for the first time in the game, just to witness the event and bid farewell. Lucas learns PK Love \u03b4 from the needle, and heads off to find the fifth needle. However, a single Pigmask Major destroys the exit to Saturn Valley, leaving Lucas and co. trapped. Turning the tables back in Lucas's favor, the Mr. Saturns are able to build a flying machine using a wire cage and several birds, some of which Lucas catches as contribution. During this time, one Mr. Saturn takes Lucas's Courage Badge in order to clean it, and another Mr. Saturn provides the group with coffee. As the coffee is consumed, messages of encouragement are relayed to the group against a psychedelic background in a familiar format. The machine is able to fly Lucas & co. out of Saturn Valley before falling into the ocean and washing up at Cerulean Beach. Upon waking up, they decide to continue the search for the remaining three needles.The Fifth Needle  Learning that the next needle is on an island on the other side of the ocean, Lucas & co. decide to swim there, lacking any other form of transport. Walking into the water, the group traverses the seabed, refilling their lungs when necessary via suggestively-designed oxygen suppliers. Eventually, the group is pulled into the currents of an aquatic entity known as Master Eddy, who engages them in battle. Master Eddy puts up a strong fight, attacking twice each turn. Just as he's about to be defeated, he summons a gigantic whirlpool that instantly defeats the group, washes away their items, and sends them to drift the waves unconscious... The group washes up on the shores of Tanetane Island, weak and with little chance of survival. Their lack of items (and Lucas & Kumatora's lack of sufficient PP) prevents them from healing, and their path is blocked by a Zombieshroom too strong for them to defeat. With no other choice, Lucas, Kumatora, and Duster ingest some strange purple mushrooms; Boney refuses to eat them, sensing something suspicious. While the mushrooms do heal Lucas, Kumatora, and Duster completely, they turn out to be psilocybin mushrooms and induce a series of tormenting hallucinations. All the creatures on the island appear to the affected group as people they know, who spout messages reflecting the group's darker sides, particularly their fears, tragic memories, and other negative emotions. Lucas seems to be affected the most, seeing himself as below everyone else and deserving of scorn. These figures also attack the group when talked to, taking the form of Eerie Smiles before later revealing their true forms. Eventually, the group reaches the house of the Magypsy Mixolydia, who appears unusually feminine and beautiful for the normally masculine-looking Magypsies. She also appears with Ocho, a suave-looking sailor. Mixolydia immediately recognizes that Lucas & co. ingested the island's Hallucination Mushrooms, and reverses its effects by smacking each of them on the back of the head using a board of wood. Once the effects wear off, she and Ocho appear to the group in their actual state: a pink-haired humanoid with a masculine physique, and a large, magenta octopus with a black cap. Mixolydia allows the group to stay the night at her house, while Ocho gives them all the items they lost during the fight against Master Eddy; Ocho explains that he regularly combs the beaches of Tanetane Island, and happened to come across the group's items. Mixolydia allows the group to go after her needle, but warns that it is well-guarded. Once the group reaches the site, they understand why: it is guarded by the Barrier Trio, three large golems consisting of Barrier Man, Barrier Dude, and Barrier Gal. The Barrier Trio manages to prove themselves as a formidable force, but are defeated anyways by Lucas & co. However, before Lucas can pull the needle, the Pigmasks arrive, and the Masked Man incapacitates Lucas & co. with a bolt of lightning from his energy sword. The Masked Man then pulls the needle and flies off. Mixolydia then arrives, despairing over the increasing advance of the Pigmasks. Before she disappears, she gives Lucas a Jar of Yummy Pickles to give to Ionia. NOTE: If the player had Lucas pull the third, fourth, and fifth needles in an order different than the one provided here, then the Magypsy of the last needle of these three will be the one to give Lucas the Jar of Yummy Pickles (i.e. Lydia will give the jar if her needle is pulled last, and Phrygia will give the jar if her needle is pulled last). Lucas & co. then ride home on Ocho's back, only to find out that Tazmily is nearly devoid of life. Nearly everyone has left the village in search of a better life in the big city, leaving Tazmily destined to become a ghost town. Knowing that there's no reason to keep living in Tazmily, Lucas leads the group to Ionia's house, hoping to find the last two needles...The Sixth Needle  Making their way through the Argilla Pass, the group eventually reaches Ionia's house. There, she takes the Jar of Yummy Pickles and provides the group with Waters of Time to sprinkle on the time-locked vines in front of the Chupichupyoi Temple, so that they will clear out and make the entrance to the temple accessible. Lucas and co. head off to the temple; along the way, they bump into a hooded Mr. Saturn that gives back Lucas's Courage Badge. Upon being cleaned it is revealed to be a Franklin Badge, a legendary artifact said to deflect bolts of electricity. At the Chupichupyoi Temple, the Pigmasks are trying in vain to break through the vines that block the entrance. Just as the Masked Man grows impatient and tries to bomb the entrance open, Lucas and company arrive. Lucas forms another telepathic link with the Masked Man, who fires another intense bolt of lightning at him. This time, however, the bolt is reflected off of Lucas's Franklin Badge and back at the Masked Man. Learning that Lucas & co have grown too strong to simply brush aside, the Masked Man engages them in battle. His status as the commander-in-chief of the Pigmasks easily shows, as he is one of the toughest opponents in the entire game. However, Lucas & co. eventually manage to defeat him, prompting him & his army to retreat. With the Pigmasks gone, Lucas pours the Waters of Time onto the temple's vines, which quickly mature and wither away, leaving the doors open. Inside the temple lies Ionia's needle. The temple also contains a mural, which depicts the concept of majority rule: when the Seven Needles are all pulled, whoever pulled the most needles will be the one who awakens the Dark Dragon. Before it can be pulled, Ionia walks in and gives Kumatora a parting gift: she teaches her the power of PK Starstorm. With preparations in order, Lucas pulls the sixth needle and realizes the amazing power of PK Love \u03a9, the strongest tier of the attack. Ionia then disappears, orphaning Kumatora, who was taken in by Ionia as a surrogate daughter many years ago. With a race to the final needle underway, Lucas & co. are stopped by a well-dressed man who claims to represent the king, whom he refers to as \"Porky\". He claims that the king has invited Lucas and his friends to go to New Pork City, the same \"big city\" that everyone's already migrated to. Without any explanation, Lucas & co. accept the offer and head to the big city like everyone else...Chapter 8: All Things... Isn't This Such a Utopia?  At New Pork City, all the residents of Tazmily Village live in perfect glory. The town captures the very essence of capitalist life, from the stores to the skyscrapers. Even more noteworthy are the numerous images of King Porky scattered throughout the town; these effigies finally clarify that the fabled Pig King is actually Pokey Minch, who was last seen in the EarthBound series's timeline fleeing from the Cave of the Past following the destruction of the Embodiment of Evil, Giygas. It becomes clear that Pokey ended up founding & leading the Pigmask Army, and is now the king of the Nowhere Islands. It can also be inferred that Pokey changed his name to \"Porky\" at some point, for reasons unknown (also note that \"Porky\" is the character's Japanese name in MOTHER2 [Japanese version of EarthBound], and the name \"Pokey\" was a mistranslation; the preceding sentence serves as a way of addressing this by taking the MOTHER trilogy's content into full account). At some point, Lucas and co. are drawn into the city's cinema theater, which perpetually airs a film chronicling the events of EarthBound. What's more important, however, is a foul odor coming from the seats that turns out to be the result of a Stink Bug. Boney chases the bug through a broken speaker, disappearing from sight. Lucas, Duster, and Kumatora follow him into the sewers through an entrance in the New Pork Arcade, revealed by a man complaining of the air quality. The group retrieves Boney in a slum of abandoned apartments inside the sewers. More important is that one of these apartments houses \"Beanstalk\" Leder, the old bell-ringer of Tazmily who remained unseen for quite some time. Leder was clearly taken prisoner by the Pigmasks, as seen by his legs being chained up in an apartment below. When the group goes up to him, he speaks for the first time in the game; he clarifies that he wasn't a mute, but rather chose not to speak unless it was absolutely necessary. Leder then takes the opportunity to divulge everything he knows about the history of the Nowhere Islands:The Truth  Long ago, a world spanning much farther than the Nowhere Islands existed, and was populated with innumerable people. Eventually, the world was destroyed by mankind, who sought refuge aboard a White Ship, created for the sole purpose of saving mankind in the event of an apocalypse. The ship ended up taking them to the Nowhere Islands, where they were protected by and coexisted with the Dark Dragon. However, mankind soon realized that they couldn't live together with the Dragon anymore. As a result, a group of special people used the Seven Needles to place the Dragon in a state of suspended animation, hiding it beneath the earth. These people and their descendants, the Magypsies, guarded the needles until the Dragon's power was absolutely necessary. Fearing another apocalypse, the people of the Nowhere Islands decided to wipe their memories using the Egg of Light and start over, believing that it was the lifestyle of our world that brought about the end. Keeping their original names, they founded Tazmily village and live their lives out in peace and harmony, unable to remember anything from the distant past (according to Leder, they wanted to create a plethora of myths and legends, but were unable to due to the memory alteration process being done in haste). In order to keep everyone's memories from reverting, Leder's mind was not wiped, being chosen specifically because his incredible height made him stand out. Serving as Tazmily's bell ringer, the sound of the bell would keep people's new memories intact via \"a suggestion\", and he was tasked with divulging the truth about Tazmily when it was truly necessary: now. On a brief note of tangent, a kingdom existed long ago, led by the king of Osohe, before the White Ship arrived on the Nowhere Islands. However, the kingdom disappeared long before the White Ship's arrival, but still played a vital role in the development of Tazmily: Kumatora was an orphan when she was taken aboard the White Ship. Upon arriving at the Nowhere Islands, she was taken into the care of the Magypsies and given the role of Osohe Castle's princess. Tying into this were the assignment of Wess & Duster as Kumatora's retainers. Although the people of Tazmily didn't know how their charade would turn out, they were able to live in peace for ages... until Porky arrived. Using the Phase Distorter I that he stole from Dr. Andonuts during the events of EarthBound, Porky traveled through time and space, eventually arriving at the Nowhere Islands, unable to return to his own era. He learned about the secrets of the islands' people from Locria, the seventh Magypsy. Using this knowledge, he brought people from previous time periods onto the islands using the Phase Distorter, and brainwashed them into becoming his servants, creating the Pigmask Army. The citizens of New Pork City were also subjected to brainwashing as well. Viewing the world as his own personal toy box, Porky reshaped the land to his liking, resulting in the Fascinating Chimera Project and the modernized Tazmily. After learning about the Seven Needles and the Dark Dragon from Locria, Porky decided to pull the needles and use the Dragon's power for himself. However, the only people capable of pulling the needle are the select few who are capable of learning PK Love, meaning that neither Porky nor the Magypsies could pull the needles. This ultimately clarifies that the Masked Man is being used as Porky's proxy to pull the needles, and Lucas is the only one who can stop him. Leder, honoring the word \"leader\" that serves as his namesake, orders Lucas to pull the final needle and awaken the Dark Dragon before the Masked Man does, concerned for the fate of reality itself...The Ultimate Mission  Taking Leder's orders to heart, Lucas, Duster, Kumatora, and Boney head out of the sewers to begin their mission. On the way out, they are ambushed by New Fassad, now updated and renamed \"Miracle Fassad\". Miracle Fassad divulges on his passionate hatred towards the group for defeating him in Fire Mountain, and attacks them out of revenge (again). During the fight, Miracle Fassad catches the group off-guard when he hits them with PK Starstorm, revealing that he is capable of learning PSI. Despite this intense buff, Miracle Fassad is eventually defeated. Damaged beyond repair, Miracle Fassad delivers a testament that all of the events that have taken place so far are all part of Porky's \"game\". Claiming freedom from the game (both figuratively and literally), Miracle Fassad self-destructs, the wreckage falling into the sewers, dead. On the streets of New Pork City, more and more people have began to gather, indicating that something big is about to occur. Lucas & co. acknowledge this and begin to traverse the Empire Porky Building, intending to confront Porky himself. Along the way, they run into the DCMC, who are about to hold their last concert ever. Duster temporarily re-joins the band for this one last outing, and the DCMC holds their biggest performance ever, promising an indefinitely long show. However, the concert is interrupted by a power outage, committed by Porky himself. Porky knows what Lucas & co. are trying to do, and personally request that they meet him on the 100th floor. The group climbs higher and higher up the building. On one floor, they find the Ultimate Chimera, who found its way to New Pork City following its escape from the Chimera Lab. The creature poses a smaller threat this time, as it is isolated to a single hallway and is easily bypassable. Of more importance, however, is that one of the floors contains the house of Locria, the traitorous Magypsy. The house contains a pair of brass horns, a plethora of Luxury Bananas, and a familiar peddler's outfit. In addition, a nearby mouse describes that Locria was seen as disturbing by the other Magypsies, and had an unsettling \"Nwehehehehe!\" laugh. Despite this, the mouse was good friends with Locria, whose return he awaits. All of this implies that Locria, the seventh Magypsy, was actually Fassad... Another floor contains a strange laboratory, concealing an even stranger room: the Nice Person Hot Springs. Here, people are kept in incubator tanks reminiscent of the ones on Mt. Itoi and inside Stonehenge Base. Inside these tanks, people are immersed in an unknown green fluid, somehow being psychologically manipulated into obeying Porky... Eventually, Lucas & co. reach the last few floors, where the chauffeur who took the group to the city in the first place greets them. He explains that he is also the host of several games that everyone must pass in order to meet Porky. In these games, Lucas plays against a robotic duplicate of the Pig King, dubbed \"Mini-Porky\". However, Lucas isn't supposed to win-- he's supposed to lose to the Mini-Porky by a narrow margin. Eventually, Lucas passes each of the games and is granted access to meet Porky. Along the way, he, Duster, Kumatora, and Boney face off against Porky's last trial: the Natural Killer Cyborg, a cybernetic super-machine capable of incredibly powerful attacks. Despite its brawn, the group manages to destroy it before continuing their trek to the 100th floor.Reunions and Revelations  On the 99th floor, the group finds a long, empty hallway, where the loudspeakers play a soft, ambient tune: the title theme to EarthBound Beginnings, the original MOTHER. Even more notable is what lies behind the door at the end of the hallway: the Hall of Memories. Here, Porky has collected numerous pieces of memorabilia from the events of EarthBound, and showcases it via a ride on a boat designed after his old next-door neighbor's house. Porky's also kept the Pencil Eraser, whose sole purpose is to destroy a nearby Iron Pencil, which has rusted considerably in the events between EarthBound and Mother 3. Finally at the 100th floor, the group comes face-to-face with Porky Minch. He asks that the group engages in peaceful negotiation talks with him, before exploding, regardless of the response. In reality, the group met one of eleven Mecha-Porkies, and the other ten ambush the group and fight. Seven of the ten robots are destroyed by the group, but the former gains the upper hand by overwhelming the latter with reinforcements: miscellaneous enemies and other Mecha-Porkies. However, the DCMC suddenly bursts in and destroys the remaining robots, explaining along the way that they figured out how Porky was able to win the allegiance of Tazmily in the first place: brainwashing them through the DCMC's music. The band finally gets its revenge and helps the group win the battle. In the fight's aftermath, the residents of Tazmily (except Isaac, who became a Pigmask between Chapters 7 and 8) gather on the 100th floor to meet Porky. Obligingly, the Pig King appears for them-- descending from the ceiling on his  life-support bed. Porky has aged tremendously since his last sighting in EarthBound, and is in ill health. Porky admonishes Tazmily for thinking that it could escape its past by altering their memories, and divulges on his sadistic nature. He also reveals that the seventh and final needle, Locria's Needle, has been discovered beneath New Pork City itself. On this note, he goes off, and drops Lucas, Duster, Kumatora, Boney, and Flint down into a cavern innumerable miles beneath the earth...The Seventh Needle  Inside the cavern, the group gradually descends into the lowest passageway, where the needle is sure to be hidden. At some point, Flint stops the group and continues on his own, growing suspicious on the Masked Man's identity. Lucas, Duster, Kumatora, and Boney follow after him. When everyone catches up, Flint makes a startling revelation: the Masked Man is Claus. After falling from the Drago Plateau in Chapter 1, Claus was taken by the Pigmasks and converted into the perfect Chimera for Porky's use. Flint, while shocked at this discovery, finally earns closure; his three-year search for Claus has finally come to an end. As Lucas, Duster, Kumatora, and Boney continue onwards to the final needle, they are suddenly stopped by Porky, who engages them in battle. During their fight, Porky explains everything he hasn't told them. Because of his repeated time travel, his age accelerated to a point where he has petrified and is dependent on his bed mecha for interaction. He has also been rendered immortal, meaning that even if he is defeated, he can still return, regardless of his situation. Porky also claims that the Masked Man's lack of a heart means that if he is the one to awaken the Dark Dragon, then all of reality will be erased, a possibility Porky is \"more than prepared for.\" Eventually, Porky's machine runs out of power, leaving him helpless, but still immortal. Seeking escape, Porky seals himself inside the Absolutely Safe Capsule, a device built for him by Dr. Andonuts and the Mr. Saturns. The capsule keeps Porky protected from all harm, but he is unable to do anything in turn. By default, the battle ends... At this point, Dr. Andonuts appears. He explains that he repeatedly warned Porky not to use the Absolutely Safe Capsule, because once it is closed, it can never be reopened: the capsule wasn't designed to protect whatever's inside from outside harm, but rather to protect the world from whatever's inside. Since Porky is now isolated from the rest of the world, his claim about always being able to return has been disproven. Yet, since Porky's goal was to be freed from everyone that disliked him and everything he disliked, fleeing into the Absolutely Safe Capsule may have given Porky exactly what he wanted. In the meantime, Dr. Andonuts gives Porky childish payback in the form of rolling the Absolutely Safe Capsule back and forth.Claus  Eventually, the group reaches the seventh needle-- and Claus. Still under Porky's influence, he fires an intense bolt of lightning at the group. This time, he manages to knock out everyone but Lucas, whose Franklin Badge deflects the lightning back at him again. With the circumstances narrowed down, Claus & Lucas duel. During the fight, Lucas's grief prevents him from fighting Claus, leaving him only able to defend himself. Claus easily overpowers his brother with laser attacks, PK Love, and the like. However, a voice starts to echo across the battlefield: Hinawa's voice. Calling from beyond, she pleads the brothers to stop fighting, focusing most of her attention on the mindless, heartless Claus. While her words are initially futile, Hinawa eventually reaches Claus, who starts to become tormented by his reawakening memories. He responds by increasing his firepower, and prepares to kill Lucas with a blast of PK Love. However, Flint jumps out and takes the blast for Lucas. Flint attempts to speak to Claus, but is further incapacitated by another blast of PK Love. Angered, Lucas gains the courage to fight, but is initially scolded by Hinawa and becomes heartbroken during subsequent attacks. Eventually, Hinawa awakens one final memory in Claus: the day he and Lucas received their names. He remembers Hinawa & Flint sharing their ambitions for their children, and starts to remember who he really is. With Claus starting to revert to his original self, he becomes considerably weakened by his emotions. Overcome by all of this, he eventually removes his helmet, signifying that he is once again Claus, and no longer the Masked Man. However, he is wracked with ages of grief: Hinawa's murder, his failed attempt at revenge, his conversion into a chimera, and the flood of emotions Hinawa's ghost surged into him. Unable to handle any of it anymore, Claus kills himself, firing one last lightning bolt at Lucas, intentionally reflecting it off of Lucas's Franklin Badge and back at him. Severely electrocuted and nearing death, he staggers towards Lucas and collapses into his arms. Claus then gives one final goodbye to what is left of his family, and takes his final breath...It Is Finished  Lucas rises and takes in the requiem. Flint asks Lucas to forgive Claus for his actions, and then instructs Lucas to pull the final needle and awaken the Dark Dragon. Lucas walks over to the needle, firmly grasps it in his hands, and, with all of his might, pulls it out of the earth. Having pulled four out of the seven needles, Lucas awakens the Dark Dragon, resulting in an event unlike any other. Awakened from its long slumber, the Dark Dragon summons a second apocalypse, this time destroying the Pigmasks and its influences on the Nowhere Islands. The world crumbles once more, and when the Pigmask mothership is struck down by a stray piece of brimstone, it becomes clear that the Pigmasks are gone forever. The scene then fades to black, leaving only some text saying \"END...?\" If the player uses the D-Pad at this point, the \"END...?\" text will move away, and, regardless of how they push the D-Pad, the player themself will walk around the dark screen. By doing this, they are able to interact with the game's characters, whose fates are left ambiguous (though it is slightly implied and often accepted that they survived; those definitely included within the group are Kumatora, Wess, a Mr. Saturn, a mole cricket, a save frog, Porky, the Rope Snake, and Boney). The characters discuss the second apocalypse, which was enough to make Kumatora cry for the first time. Some of them (such as the aforementioned Kumatora) are recovering from their fears, while others describe the event as \"a miracle\" and look forward to the future. Along the way, the player finds the doorknob that Thomas pulled off of Flint's front door back in Chapter 1, and tucks it away. An object implied to be the Absolutely Safe Capsule is among the party, wobbling \"with glee.\" Several of the characters in the area also express joy and relief that the player survived the apocalypse, and a character implied to be Lucas bids the player farewell, hoping that they will meet again. After the cast roll and credits finish, the screen whites out. The Mother 3 logo then appears, made entirely of wood instead of metal & wood; the sole exception is the \"O\", which is replaced by the planet Earth. This screen is a homage to the Japanese title screen of EarthBound Beginnings. Below the logo is the text \"END\". Unlike the previous games in the franchise, which leave behind implications of a possible sequel, this game ends off with a definitive \"END\".Connections to EarthBound Beginings and EarthBound Development  Mother 3 was originally announced in 1996 for the Nintendo 64. Development soon moved to the Nintendo 64DD, where it was to be a launch title, but after many delays caused by the inexperience of the development team with the hardware and 3D graphics, it was canceled in August 2000. The project was revived in 2003, now with 2D graphics on the Game Boy Advance. EarthBound 64 was a canceled game that was going to be released for the Nintendo 64 and then on the Nintendo 64DD. Several years later it was revealed that the project had started up again for the Game Boy Advance under the form of Mother 3. Much of the story seems to be based on the information known about EarthBound 64, including the four main characters, and a plot involving a Pigmask Army, but it is unknown how close its plot is to that of Mother 3 as little is known of the game. Developer Benimaru Itoh remarked at E3's 1997 convention that the game would probably utilize the Rumble Pak in battle sequences, but worried that the controller would become too cumbersome for players given the time-consuming nature of role-playing games. Itoh also aimed to allow players to pick several character faces or create new visages with Mario Artist. Shigesato Itoi's team ran into some trouble while developing this game, primarly because of their inexperience with 3D games and the difficulty of developing for Nintendo 64 hardware. The final nail in the coffin, which was the Nintendo 64DD's failure, destroyed all hope for the game. On August 21, 2000, Itoi officially confirmed the game's cancellation.Mother 3 Deluxe Box  A limited release version of Mother 3 version was sold in Japan in addition to the basic title. This \"Deluxe Box\" included a copy of Mother 3 for the Game Boy Advance, a Special Edition Game Boy Micro and a Franklin Badge for \u00a518,000. Pre-orders began on March 1, 2006, continuing until the release of the game on April 20 of that year. Upon meeting an unexpected demand, only a small fraction of the Deluxe Boxes were shipped by the release date of the game.Marketing  Beginning in February 2006, lead designer Shigesato Itoi initiated a systematic divulgence of Mother 3 information on the official Mother 3 website (https://www.1101.com/MOTHER3/). The additions are documented below: This information, which was rationed out on a weekly basis until the April 20 release date, can be found at the official Mother 3 website.Demand for an international release  Since the original, scrapped, Nintendo 64 version's announcement in 1996, many fans of the Mother series have been pleading for Mother 3 to be given a global release. A cult following has formed around the franchise, and many petitions and demands have been made towards Nintendo of America; however, there do not appear to be any plans to release Mother 3 in North America as EarthBound 2. Rumors in the August 2006 issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly suggested the possibility that Nintendo may compile all three Mother titles onto one Nintendo DS cartridge, and could possibly be released in North America and Europe. These have been proven false, however, following Nintendo's shift in focus to handheld games for the Nintendo 3DS. In November of 2006, NintendoWorldReport.com interviewed Nate Bihldorff, the Nintendo of America Localization Producer/Manager, about the localization process he and his team must go through for a video game. When NintendoWorldReport.com mentioned Mother 3, Bihldorff stated that he and his team were not working on Mother 3. However, he does mention some of his writers are not under him, so discussions of the game may be going on. He also mentions that he does not plan on working on it in the immediate future. Because no official translation has been announced, a fan translation was developed over the course of roughly two years, and released on October 17, 2008. When this translation \"patch\" is applied to a Japanese ROM of Mother 3, it converts all of the Japanese text on the ROM to English. Throughout the progress made on the project, lead developers Tomato and Jeffman were firm in stating that if Nintendo announced an official localization of Mother 3, they would immediately cease their work, indicating that their sole goal was to ensure that the game was translated to English.Music  Mother 3 has spawned two soundtrack releases. The first, Mother 3+, was released in Japan on November 2, 2006, consisting of arranged songs by the Crazy Ken Band as DCMC, and a vocal track by Taeko Onuki, as well as some songs from previous installments of the series. It was later released in the iTunes Music Store in North America on April 1, 2007, featuring an additional bonus track unavailable on the CD release. Mother 3+ is no longer available for purchase in North America. The second soundtrack, Mother 3i, was released on the February 6, 2007 in the iTunes Music Store and Napster in Japan, as well as a few other online music services. Mother 3i, like Mother 3+ is no longer available in North America for unknown reasons. It contains a different selection of music from the game. It was composed by Sh\u014dgo Sakai and contains a different selection of music from the game than the Mother 3+. Songs from the album also appear in Super Smash Bros. Brawl in their original or remixed form.Reception  Famitsu scored Mother 3 with a 35/40 (one point higher than EarthBound), providing the first public review of the game. Australian publication Hyper Magazine gave it 92/100, and the \"Hyper Big Rubber Stamp of Approval\" (awarded to all games with a score over ninety), and was said to be \"One of the best RPG's ever made.\" Destructoid, a general gaming site, named it the third best game of the decade, declaring that \"Mother 3 may have the most complex, mature, and heart-wrenching story of any videogame of the last decade.\" Mother 3 sold 205,914 copies in its first 3 days on sale, and 338,382 copies were sold from April 20 to June 25 in Japan.Trivia External links Claus  Claus (\u30af\u30e9\u30a6\u30b9, Klaus in the North American version of Brawl) is a major character in Mother 3. He is a boy from Tazmily Village, and the older twin brother of Lucas. Claus looks very similar to Lucas other than the different colors of his clothing and hair, though he is energetic and far more courageous than Lucas. He is last seen by the player lying motionless near the Drago Plateau, although the residents of Tazmily are never made aware of this. It is not explicitly stated that Claus is alive until the end of Chapter 8, where it is revealed he is being exploited for his ability to use the elusive PK Love by Porky Minch.Appearance  Claus resembles Lucas in every way, except for the color of his clothes and hair. He has a similar hairstyle to Lucas, but he has orange hair, and wears a striped T-Shirt that resembles his brother's; With the colors different. They are Yellow and Cyan. He wears orange pants, white socks and cyan-white shoes. However, when he is in his masked man uniform, his appearance becomes slightly different. He wears a long yellow shirt instead of his causal short striped shirt, although it cannot be seen very well because of his black-gray coat. However, he still wears his orange pants. He wears black-grayish boots.Masked Man  The Masked Man is is the secondary antagonist of\u00a0Mother 3; a mysterious\u00a0character who debuts during the final scene of the fifth chapter.\u00a0He is the only other person besides Lucas capable of removing the seven Needles. He attacks with lightning, a sword, an arm cannon and PK Love. Additionally, he has the ability to destroy PSI Shields and use mechanical wings to fly away. He also has a lightning attack that is able to instantly render Lucas's entire party unconscious, meaning that only himself and Lucas (because of the Courage Badge that was revealed to be a Franklin Badge) remain in the battle. The attack is unavoidable. The Masked Man works for Porky Minch, the Pig King, as what he refers to as his \"adorable little monster,\" and never says a word in the story onscreen. A Pigmask states to Lucas (who thought he was the Masked Man since he answered his phone) that he sounded \"kind of cheery\", possibly signalling that the Masked Man can, in fact, talk, though in an emotionless tone. The Masked Man is the final boss of Mother 3, rather than Porky Minch himself. Because of this, Porky has been the penultimate boss in both games he has appeared in. The Masked Man is in reality, Claus, who was apparently discovered near the Drago Plateau by the Pigmask Army. He was brought back to consciousness and turned into a human chimera. It is unknown whether or not he was dead when found, though the implications point more toward being dead, as the Magypsies sensed no heart in him, and it's also impossible to hear his heartbeat in battle. During this time, Porky used him as a loyal servant and gave to him near full command of the Pigmask Army. While under the control of Porky, Claus's sense of self and memories had been forgotten and pushed deep inside of him. At the end of the final battle with the Masked Man, after realizing his true identity and revealing himself as Claus, he fires an intense bolt of lightning at Lucas, purposely reflecting it off of Lucas's Franklin Badge, causing himself mortal damage and ultimately killing himself. The Masked Man has three battle themes. The first music is a variation of \"Strong One\", entitled \"Strong One (Masked Man)\". The latter songs that are heard during each portion of the final battle against the Masked Man are titled \"Battle Against the Masked Man\" and \"It is Finished\", respectively. \"It is Finished\" is an eerie, sad rendition of \"Mother 3 Love Theme\". During the moments with Hinawa speaking, the song is called \"Memory of Mother\".Unused content  Claus is the character with the most unused sprites in the game, having around 150. There is an entire set of sprites for young Claus both walking and running in a bathing suit, including one where he dives into the water and resurfaces with a gasp of air from this\u00a0unused cutscene. There are also several sprites for Claus pushing Lucas, as shown in this video, climbing, cheering, swaying from side to side, yelling, falling backward as if he was hurt, and lying on his back after the fall. This is likely due to the fact that Claus was shown to have a greater role in EarthBound 64 (a trailer of Lucas and Claus in a minecart was prominently shown), but the technological restrictions of the Game Boy Advance made this impossible to implement in Mother 3. However, his younger sprite can still be the party leader in the Debug Room and have his level increased to 99. There are also multiple unused sprites of Claus when he is older; there appears to be a sprite for him sitting, standing upright, dressed as the Masked Man and walking around, and an in-battle sprite where he still has the cannon on his right arm which can be seen using the enemy modifier code and approaching the enemy from behind. There is a notable set of Masked Man sprites where he appears to explode, a set where he is thrown backward by something, and when he is first being \"built\", possibly to be used in a cutscene at the end of either Chapter 1 or 3. The entire series of sprites can be seen animated here.In Super Smash Bros. Brawl  Claus appears in Super Smash Bros. Brawl as a sticker. Attaching this sticker to the bottom of Ness or Lucas's trophies in The Subspace Emissary increases their PK attack by 13. One of Lucas's alternate costumes also uses Claus's clothing and hair colour.Trivia Lucas  Lucas (Japanese: \u30ea\u30e5\u30ab Lucas) is the main protagonist of Mother 3 from Tazmily Village and the gentle younger twin of Claus. He is out of the seven main characters total (Lucas,\u00a0Kumatora, Duster, Boney,\u00a0Claus, Flint, and Salsa). He usually uses sticks and baseball bats as his primary weapons, along with his signature PK Love power, which grants him the ability to pull the Seven Needles to awaken the Dark Dragon sleeping underneath the Nowhere Islands.Biography  Lucas is the son of Flint and Hinawa, the grandson of Alec, and the younger twin brother of Claus. He is the youngest member of his family. He lives in Tazmily Village with his family and dog Boney. Lucas has blonde hair and black eyes, occasionally shown with a hint of teal. He usually wears a red t-shirt with yellow stripes, blue shorts, white socks and red and yellow sneakers,(sometimes orange and yellow) although this outfit is temporarily modified when he is confused with the Masked Man (who he has a strong resemblance to). He realizes his PSI powers from Ionia, one of the seven Magypsies. To learn PSI, Lucas is forced to hold his head underwater for a period of time.Personality  Until he embarks on his adventure, Lucas has a reputation for being an emotional boy, and almost the exact opposite of his twin brother, Claus. He can show determination, but only when the situation permits. Three years later, Lucas has matured into a boy much like his brother Claus, brave, determined and strong-willed.Story  Lucas is playable in the Prologue as a tutorial character. In the tutorial, Lucas learns how to dash, and is taught how to fight in a battle against the Mole Cricket. In Chapter 1, Claus, Lucas, and Hinawa fail to return to Tazmily Village from Alec's house. This causes the village to organize a search party to look for them. After Flint and Duster's fight against the Reconstructed Caribou, Claus and Lucas are found. However, Lucas is quiet, and only murmurs something about the \"forest coming to life, and taking them\". After Flint learns of Hinawa's death, he loses his grip and Claus and Lucas have their eyes covered by\u00a0Tessie\u00a0to not let them see what's happening. He attends Hinawa's funeral, where Lucas reveals that Claus went to fight the Drago that killed their mom in order to avenge her. He stays at Flint's house until the third chapter. At the end of Chapter 3, Lucas comes to assist Salsa, Kumatora, and Wess when they are cornered by Fassad. He brings Drago Jr. and his mother, apparently wanting to avenge their cyberized family member. At the start of Chapter 4, he becomes the permanent main character.PSI  Lucas is the main Assist PSI user of the party because he learns all versions of Lifeup, while Kumatora only goes up to Beta. He also learns all versions of Healing, while Kumatora only learns Alpha. He also has Refresh, which restores about 10% of the target's maximum HP each turn. His unique PSI attack is PK Love, which does anywhere from 100 to 800 damage, depending on what level of power is used. He also learns Shield, Counter, PSI Shield, PSI Counter, Offense Up, and Defense Up. In Chapter 5, he learns PK Flash. In Super Smash Bros. Brawl, however, he can use PK Fire, PK Freeze, PK Thunder, PSI Magnet, and PK Starstorm.In Super Smash Bros.  Other than being a playable character, Lucas appears in Super Smash Bros. Brawl as a playable character and a sticker with his child sprite. Attaching this sticker to the bottom of Ness or Lucas's trophies in The Subspace Emissary increases their PK attack by 13. Lucas was added into Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U as an additional DLC character and is confirmed to return in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.Trivia EarthBound  EarthBound (Japanese: MOTHER 2 \uff5e\u30ae\u30fc\u30b0\u306e\u9006\u8972\uff5e Mother 2: Gyiyg Strikes Back!), subtitled as The War Against Giygas!, is a game that was released for the the Super Nintendo Entertainment System on August 27, 1994 in Japan and on June 1, 1995 in North America. It was designed and directed by Shigesato Itoi, with music by Hiroshi Kanazu, Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu Tanaka. EarthBound chronicles the adventures of Ness, a 13-year-old boy who journeys around the world using his \"PK\" or \"PSI\" to collect eight melodies in order to save the future from an alien of pure evil, intending to sentence all of reality to the horror of eternal darkness. Despite being successful in Japan, the North American version was released to a poor commercial response. Years later, the game is now lauded by gamers worldwide for its humorous depictions of American culture and parody of the RPG video game genre, and has since become a cult classic. EarthBound was released on Nintendo's Virtual Console service for the first time on March 20, 2013 in Japan and July 18, 2013 in North America, and for the first time, Australia and Europe. A sequel to EarthBound, titled Mother 3 was released only in Japan on April 20, 2006, and has yet to see a western release.Gameplay  EarthBound features many traditional RPG elements; the player controls a party of characters who travel through the game's two dimensional world that is composed of villages, cities, and dungeons. Along the way, battles are fought against enemies, after which, the party receives experience points for victories. If enough experience points are acquired, a character's level will increase. This increases the character's attributes, like strength, defense, and health. EarthBound breaks traditional RPG features by not utilizing an overworld map. Instead, the world is entirely seamless, with no differentiation between towns and the outside world. Another non-traditional element is the perspective used for the world. The game uses oblique projection, while most 2-D RPGs use a \"top down\" view on a grid or an isometric perspective. EarthBound, unlike its predecessor EarthBound Beginnings, does not utilize random battles. When physical contact occurs between a character and an enemy, the screen switches to battle mode. In combat, characters and enemies possess a certain amount of hit points. Successive blows to an enemy reduces the amount of hit points. Once an enemy's hit points reach zero, they are defeated. In battle, the player is allowed to choose specific actions for their characters. These actions can include attacking, healing, or the use of items. Characters can also use special PSI attacks that require \"Psychic Points.\" Once each character is assigned a command, the characters and enemies perform their actions in a set order, determined by character speed. Whenever a character receives damage, the hit point box gradually \"rolls\" down, similar to an odometer. This allows players an opportunity to heal the character or win the battle before the counter hits zero, after which the character is knocked unconscious. If all characters are rendered unconscious, the game ends. Because battles are not random, tactical advantages can be gained. If the player physically contacts an enemy from behind, the player is given a first-strike priority. However, this also applies to enemies, who can also engage the party from behind. Uniquely, as Ness and his friends become stronger, battles with weaker enemies are eventually won automatically, forgoing the entire battle sequence altogether. Currency is indirectly received from Ness's father, who can also save the game's progress. Each time the party wins a battle, Ness's father deposits money in an account that can be withdrawn at ATMs. In towns, players can visit various department stores where weapons, armor, and items can be bought. Weapons and armor can be equipped to increase character strength and defense, respectively. In addition, items can be used for a number of purposes, such as healing. Towns also house several other useful facilities such as hospitals where players can be healed for a fee.Plot Characters  In EarthBound, there are four main playable characters: Ness, Paula, Jeff Andonuts and Poo. Ness remains the lead character, a silent protagonist, for the entirety of the story. He is a young boy from Onett who loves baseball, and possesses psychic abilities strong enough to affect cosmic events. He is the healer and support character of the group, as he can use Healing and Lifeup to heal effects and refill HP respectively. He also can Shield party members with Shield. For offense, Ness can use PSI Rockin, a psychokinetic move that is exclusive to him. He can also manipulate light through PSI Flash. Ness can also psychologically disrupt enemies with moves like Paralysis and Hypnosis. Ness also has the ability to teleport him and the group. His primary weapon of use are Baseball Bats. Paula is the second main party member of the game, a young girl from Twoson, where her mother runs a preschool out of their home. Like Ness, she possesses powerful psychic abilities. Paula is the first offensive character that you have available. She is able to use PSI Freeze, a strong move that does damage to a single enemy. She is also able to use PSI Fire which damages a row of enemies. Her finally offensive attack is PSI Thunder which is powerful when it hits but is difficult to land. She can absorb energy with PSI Magnet to raise her PP stat. She is able to raise her teammate's offense up or  lower the enemy's defense down. Her primary weapon of use are Frying Pans. Jeff, the third main character to join the party, is a young boy who attends a boarding school in the northern country of Winters in the region of Foggyland. The son of the famed professor Dr. Andonuts, Jeff is a child prodigy who can fix almost anything. He is the only playable character in the game that cannot use PSI. He has the unique ability to 'spy' on the enemy which reveals its stats and weaknesses and can be used for stealing items. He is the only one able to use the items that he fixed and can use bottle rockets. His primary weapon of use are Guns. Poo is the final party member. He is the oldest of the group, a residing prince from the distant land of Dalaam in the far east region of Chommo. He is presented as a powerful martial arts master. He is by-far the strongest psychic character in the game. He is able to use PSI Freeze and PSI Thunder like Paula but instead of using PSI Fire, he uses PSI Starstorm which attacks every enemy on-screen. Poo also shares PSI Magnet with Paula and Lifeup, Shield and Healing with Ness. He also has the ability to teleport as well. Poo isn't good with weapons that anyone can use like Yo-yos and Slingshots. Same can be said for gear. As a martial arts master, he uses his fist to fight. However, he can use the Sword of Kings an item that can be dropped by a Starman Super. The only downside to this is there is only a 1 in 128 chance of the enemy dropping it.Story  The story begins when Ness is awakened by a meteor that has plummeted to the earth near his home, whereupon he proceeds to investigate the crash site. When Ness gets to the crash site he discovers a police road block and Pokey Minch, his friend and neighbor, who tells him to go home. Later, Ness is woken up again by Pokey knocking at his door, demanding help to find his brother Picky. They find him near the meteor sleeping behind a tree and wake him up. Then the three encounter an insect from the meteor named Buzz Buzz who informs Ness that he is from the future where the \"universal cosmic destroyer\", Giygas, dominates the planet. Buzz Buzz senses great potential in Ness and instructs him to embark on a journey to seek out and record the melodies of eight \"sanctuaries,\" unite his own powers with the Earth's and gain the strength required to confront Giygas. After an encounter with some hostile gang members, Ness reaches the first sanctuary on a mountain above his hometown. He then proceeds to the next town, Twoson, where he rescues a girl named Paula from the Happy Happyist Cult and discovers that Pokey (who has been the high priest of cult) is working against him. Together, Ness and Paula discover the second sanctuary. With the help of the Runaway Five, a band that Ness and Paula free from debt, the two arrive in Threed, where they are ambushed and captured. While in captivity, Paula sends a telepathic message to a boy named Jeff, who resides at a boarding school. Jeff responds to the message and acquires his father's Sky Runner, a flying vehicle, in order to reach Threed. After crashing the Sky Runner, Jeff rescues Ness and Paula and joins their group. The three of them travel to Saturn Valley, a land populated by a strange race of creatures called Mr. Saturns. There, the party learns that a monster has been kidnapping the populace. Ness and the group proceed to defeat the monster and reach the third sanctuary above Saturn Valley. The party then travels through the desert to reach the next city. Upon reaching Fourside, the group again helps the Runaway Five out of debt and visits a department store only to have Paula kidnapped. Ness and Jeff proceed to find her, and along the way, destroy a hallucination-projecting relic called the Evil Mani Mani statue. The two boys continue their search only to discover that Pokey and the Mayor have taken Paula. However, because Ness and Jeff defeated the Evil Mani Mani statue, the mayor returns to normal. Pokey escapes in the Mayor's helicopter and Paula rejoins the group. After returning to Threed, Jeff repairs the Sky Runner, and they set flight for Winters to discover the fourth sanctuary. The group then crosses the ocean and arrive in Summers where Ness falls unconscious and dreams of a far-off land known as Dalaam. There, a young prince named Poo has completed his training and is instructed to join the party on their journey. The group then returns to Fourside and are able to discover the fifth sanctuary. The four then procure a boat and travel to Scaraba where they explore a pyramid in the desert. Ness and the group then travel to Dalaam and find the sixth sanctuary there, after which they acquire a submarine and travel into the Deep Darkness, a path leading them under the earth. There, they find Tenda Village, a small community populated by extremely shy creatures. After acquiring the book of overcoming shyness, Ness is able to speak to the shy villagers who allow them passage to the Lost Underworld. There, they discover the last two sanctuaries. Upon activating the final sanctuary, Ness falls unconscious and enters a strange world composed of his dreams, Magicant. There, he encounters his nightmare. After defeating it, Magicant vanishes, and Ness becomes much stronger because he has conquered Giygas's influence over him. After awakening, Ness and the group return to Saturn Valley where Jeff's father, Dr. Andonuts, has finished the Phase Distorter, a time traveling device. Dr. Andonuts explains the kids that the machine cannot warp them to the past in their current form since life cannot withstand the warp through time. In other words, time travel would likely destroy their human bodies. To remedy this problem, Dr. Andonuts proposes to them to have their souls transplanted into robotic bodies, warning them that he doesn't know whether or not the process is reversible. Despite this critical warning, Ness, Paula, Jeff and Poo are willing to take the risk. Now in the form of robots, Ness and his friends use the Phase Distorter to travel to the past where they encounter Pokey and Giygas, who, in order to contain his massive power, has been sealed inside the Devil's Machine. Pokey informs the group that Giygas became so powerful that his mind was completely destroyed, referring to him as an \"all-mighty idiot\". The group defeat Pokey, who then shuts off the Devil's Machine and releases Giygas, trapping the kids in a chaotic dimension composed of his own indefinable being. Since Giygas is too powerful for Ness and his friends to overcome by fighting, Paula begins to pray, reaching out to the inhabitants of the Earth, including family members and friends, who all pray for their safety, and eventually, she reaches out to the player. The combined prayers of both Earth's inhabitants and the player reach Giygas and exploit his weakness, which turns out to be human emotions. As a result, Giygas vanishes from existence. with all the damage he had done to Eagleland and the rest of the Earth erased from history, the souls of Ness and his friends depart from their robot bodies, travel back to the present and return to their respective bodies. After bidding each other farewell, the heroes return to their homes. After the ending credits, Picky Minch comes to Ness's house in the middle of the night and gives him a letter from Pokey that says \"Come and get me loser. Spankety, spankety, spankety!\", and the game ends with him and Ness pondering what has become of him.Development  Development on EarthBound took place as a joint effort between Ape, Inc. and HAL Laboratory, Inc. and was designed by Shigesato Itoi. The total development time for the project was five years, much longer than was initially expected. Of this, Itoi has stated that many times he felt the project was \"doomed\". Because two companies were working on EarthBound, responsibilities were spread out between the two studios. Ape had more people working on the title and oversaw the data aspects of the game while HAL worked on the programming. Because the two studios were based at separate locations, employees would regularly have to travel between the studios to work. Initial gameplay features that Itoi had in mind involved an unconventional level structure and hit points system. Itoi decided to exclude an overworld, because he wanted no distinction to remain between towns and the outside world. This resulted in each town being carefully designed to be unique. The first design concepts for the hit point boxes were to make them like pachinko balls and have them fall off the screen whenever a character was damaged. However, this was later changed to the \"rolling counter\" hit point boxes because the pachinko balls did not work so well when characters had large amounts of hit points. EarthBound is also host to a unique kind of copy protection. When played, the game continually checks the legitimacy of its cartridge. If it is determined to be an unauthorized duplicate, it begins spawning enemies at an unusually higher rate than normal. If the player is able to overcome this challenge and reaches the game's final encounter, Giygas, the game would freeze in the middle of the battle, at which point all saved games are permanently deleted. Some of the difficulties posed by the development of EarthBound were the data restrictions imposed by the Super Nintendo Entertainment System cartridge size. It was initially designed to fit on an 8 megabit cartridge. However, it was later pushed to 12 megabits and then finally pushed onto a 24 megabit cartridge. This can partially be attributed to the large amount of music composed for the title. Other aspects of the project that remained difficult were programming concepts. The oblique projection techniques proved difficult to program and were time consuming as well. The bicycle and delivery man systems posed problems as well due to their own complex programming schemes. Some aspects of the character designs remain very personal for Shigesato Itoi. In an interview on his website, Itoi describes how his inspiration for the final battle with Giygas resulted from a \"traumatic\" childhood event. When Itoi was a very little boy, he accidentally viewed the wrong movie at a theater, a Shint\u014dh\u014d film entitled The Military Policeman and the Dismembered Beauty. According to Itoi the film featured a graphic rape scene near a river that traumatized Itoi so much that his parents began to worry about his well-being. Years later, Itoi integrated the experience into Giygas's dialogue for the final battle. Nintendo eventually announced a release date of August 27, 1994 for Japan, and invested a large amount of money into promoting the new game. Other efforts included bundling a full length strategy guide with the game, complete in a bigger box, and affixing a price much lower than other titles at the time. Scratch and sniff stickers also came bundled with the game. EarthBound was released in Japan on August 27, 1994, and was well received. The North American version was released almost a year later on June 1, 1995, and was met with lukewarm responses. A sequel was announced three years later for the Nintendo 64DD, entitled EarthBound 64 or Mother 3. However, the game became plagued by problems as release date pushbacks occurred, as well as failures to appear at popular gaming conventions, like E3. Nintendo eventually announced its cancellation on August 21, 2000. Years later, Mother 3 resurfaced as a Game Boy Advance title and was released only in Japan. On May 5, 2005, Shigesato Itoi announced that he had no plans to develop the Mother series any further. After the development of the Wii system, it was expected that EarthBound will be released for the Virtual Console, but due to supposed copyright issues involving music sampling, and Nintendo of Japan's refusal to let the game be modified, it was stated that EarthBound would never be re-released outside of Japan. However, during the Nintendo Direct show on April 17, 2013, Nintendo announced that EarthBound would be re-released for the Wii U's Virtual Console in America and Europe in 2013. The Japanese version was already re-released in March of the same year. On July 18, 2013, EarthBound was suddenly released on the Wii U Virtual Console for $9.99. As of August 2013, Earthbound is 1# on the VC in most of Europe and is 2nd place in America, behind Donkey Kong.Music  EarthBound's soundtrack, Mother 2: Gyiyg Strikes Back, was released on compact disc and cassette tape by Sony Records on November 2, 1994. It consists of twenty-four tracks, three of which are remixes. Some songs from EarthBound appear in Super Smash Bros. Melee and Super Smash Bros. Brawl in their original or remixed form. Development of the music for EarthBound remained much easier than its predecessor. In an interview with Weekly Famitsu, Keiichi Suzuki commented on how the Super Nintendo Entertainment System gave the composers much more freedom to compose what they wanted. Suzuki also cited John Lennon as an influential figure to all the composers while the soundtrack was being developed. EarthBound is controversially known for its heavy use of sampling popular music, a factor which has prevented it from being re-released. Throughout the game, a distinct UFO-like sound effect can be heard in many themes, most noticeably at the start of Otherworldly Foe. The noise can be heard in places such as nighttime Onett and inside caverns. The sound also appears in Mother 3, most noticably in the room of the Empire Porky Building following the Hall of Memories. Coincidentally, the theme is the \"Nighttime Onett\" theme from one of the earliest segments of the game.Reception  EarthBound became a great success in Japan, eventually rising to #1 on Weekly Famitsu's top 30 chart along with hearty recommendations by the magazine reviewers. Commercial reactions in America, on the other hand, were much lower than Nintendo had anticipated. American audiences were largely indifferent to Japanese RPGs and would remain this way until titles like Final Fantasy VII took the genre into the mainstream. Years later, many American critics have praised the game for being ahead of its time, as well as for its storyline, graphics, and particularly, its humor. In the June 2008 issue of Nintendo Power, EarthBound was revealed to be the #1 \"Readers' Most Wanted\" Virtual Console title, with EarthBound Beginnings close behind at #2.Reviews  Reviews of EarthBound have generally been positive. In Allgame's review, EarthBound was declared \"one of the most original role-playing games of the 1990s.\" The site then went on to praise its storyline, humor, and characters. A point of contention between critics were the simplistic graphics. In All RPG's review of the game, the graphics were described as \"horrid,\" while Nintendojo and 1UP enjoyed them, with 1UP going so far as to say \"regardless of what anyone tells you, the graphics are awesome.\" 1UP also criticized the title's similarities to Dragon Quest, but in the end declared EarthBound a game \"worth experiencing.\" Nintendojo and Gamasutra also criticized the similarities to Dragon Quest, with Gamasutra declaring EarthBound an \"unabashed Dragon Quest clone...\" Despite the criticism, Gamasutra regarded the title as \"as one of the greatest RPGs on the SNES.\" The game's audio was also praised, with All RPG declaring it \"some of the best music on the Super Nintendo.\" Of all EarthBound's elements, however, the most lauded was its humor, being universally praised by all critics for its comedic, albeit confusing, depictions of American culture and parody of the RPG genre.Legacy  EarthBound is regarded by critics as one of the greatest RPGs on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, as well as one of the best of the 1990s. The game has also become a cult classic and possesses substantial fanbases in both Japan and North America. As a result, the game regularly appears on readers' choice polls in both countries. In a 2005 readers' choice poll of the top 99 best games of all time conducted by IGN, EarthBound was voted 46th on the list. A year later, IGN conducted a similar readers' choice poll where EarthBound moved up to be 33rd on the list. The game has also appeared on lists conducted by the Japanese. In a 2006 readers' poll conducted by Famitsu magazine, the game was voted the 37th best game of all time on a list of 100 titles. In an introspective of the 20 essential Japanese RPGs, Gamasutra featured EarthBound on the list.Super Smash Bros. series  EarthBound is one of the many Nintendo franchises featured extensively in the Super Smash Bros. series, having playable characters, stages, music tracks, trophies, and stickers representing the series.Super Smash Bros.  Ness appears as an unlockable character in the first Super Smash Bros. game on the Nintendo 64, marking his first appearance in 3D, although he and Captain Falcon are the only characters that appear without having a stage from their respective games. To unlock Ness, you had to beat Classic in Normal difficulty without dying once.Super Smash Bros. Melee  Ness appears again in Super Smash Bros. Melee, this time as a starting character in the roster. Onett and Fourside appear as stages, and nine trophies from EarthBound appear, Ness, a Mr. Saturn, a Starman, a UFO, Jeff Andonuts, Paula, Poo, and two other trophies of Ness's special moves in the game.Super Smash Bros. Brawl  Ness again appears as an unlockable character in Super Smash Bros. Brawl. The Mother franchise also gets another playable fighter joining the fray in the form of Lucas from Mother 3, appearing as a starter character. Lucas' appearance in the game marks not only his first 3D appearance, but his first appearance outside of Japan as well. The Onett stage from Melee reappears as a Classic Stage, joined by New Pork City as a new stage and the largest stage in the game. The stage features the Ultimate Chimera, capable of instant KO's to players who run into it. The six EarthBound-based trophies that appear are Ness, his Final Smash of PK Starstorm, Franklin Badge, Mr. Saturn, Jeff, and Porky (despite using his Mother 3 appearance). The eight EarthBound-based stickers used are Ness and his party, Mr. Saturn, Starman, Master Belch, and Porky (using his EarthBound appearance).Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U  Ness again was an unlockable character in the same style as Brawl. Onett from Melee reappears in this game on the Wii U and Magicant appears in the 3DS Version. Lucas doesn't appear in this game at the start but appears as downloadable content. The Franklin Badge and Mr. Saturn returns as items.Fan works  Since gaining a large cult following, EarthBound's fanbase has created a variety of work, ranging from fanmade games to drawings. EarthBound's soundtrack has also been completely remixed by fans and released as a free downloadable tribute album entitled Bound Together. The album encompasses 48 tracks and includes performances from well known video game cover bands, such as the OneUps, as well as various artists from remixing communities like OverClocked ReMix.Trivia Ninten  Ninten (\u30cb\u30f3\u30c6\u30f3, Ninten) is the main protagonist of EarthBound Beginnings. He is a boy from the suburbs of Podunk, the older brother of Minnie and Mimmie, the son of Carol and her unnamed husband, and the great-grandson of George and Maria. He usually uses common-place items such as baseball bats\u00a0as his primary weapon, along with boomerangs and slingshots. Ninten is the only character in the EarthBound series to suffer from asthma during battle. This is similar to Ness's homesick status effect in that it is unique to their characters only.\u00a0Appearance  Ninten is stated in the encyclopedia to be 152 cm (5ft 0in) tall and weighing 42 kg (93 lbs). He wears a red baseball cap with a blue bill turned to his left, and sticking out of it is his short black hair. He has black eyes, which on his clay model resemble the style of eyes drawn on 1920s-1930s cartoon characters. He wears a blue t-shirt with thin yellow stripes, tucked under blue shorts on only one side. His socks are red, and he wears blue shoes.Biography  Ninten lives in a small house north of Podunk with his Mother and Father (although the latter is rarely at home, and does not appear in-game until the epilogue), and his two twin sisters. Ninten's adventure begins when a poltergeist causes some objects in his home to become animate and violent. After Ninten routs the poltergeist by defeating a possessed baby doll, he begins to investigate the origin of these strange phenomena, which have begun occurring across the countryside. The cause of these events is later revealed to be a group of alien invaders led by\u00a0Giygas. Like most protagonists of early Nintendo games, Ninten is generally a silent character, having no speaking roles beyond \"yes\" or \"no\" responses, with the exception of a brief few lines of dialogue at the end of the game. Ninten's personal weapon type is baseball bats, and his PSI abilities are primarily supportive and restorative in nature. As the game progresses, Ana develops feelings for Ninten, which culminates in a scene in which the two dance in a cottage on Mt. Itoi, where the player may choose whether or not he reciprocates. In EarthBound Beginnings and Mother 1 + 2, it is implied that the two maintain a relationship after the events of the game as the final cutscenes show Ana receiving a letter from Ninten. Ninten is the only character in the series to be asthmatic. When his asthma is acting up, he is unable to take action in combat, somewhat similar to Ness's homesickness. Ninten's exclusive ability is 4th-D Slip, which can be used to flee from any escapable combat engagement with guaranteed success. Ninten's favorite food is Prime Ribs, and his favorite animal is the penguin.PSI Abilities  Throughout Mother, Ninten can learn a variety of different Assist- and Recover-type PSI abilities. Among the Assist abilities are 4th-D Slip , DefenseDown, DefenseUp, Hypnosis, OffenseUp,\u00a0PowerShield, PSI Shield and QuickUp. Among the Other abilities are Telepathy and Teleport. Finally, among the Recover abilities are Healing and\u00a0LifeUp. Ninten is the only Mother series protagonist that doesn't know any offensive PSI. However, it is interesting to note that in the commercial for the original Mother, Ninten and Ana are seen working together to cast the offensive\u00a0PK Beam to destroy a robot resembling one of the R\u20227030 series; a slight departure from Ninten's in-game PSI arsenal.In the Super Smash Bros. Series  Ninten appears in Super Smash Bros. Brawl as a sticker. Attaching this sticker to the bottom of Ness or Lucas's trophies in The Subspace Emissary increases their PK attack by 24. It is possible that Ninten may have also been considered briefly for Brawl, but he never made it past the planning stages. In Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS, he appears in the background of Magicant stage\u00a0with his friends. Unlike his counterparts Ness and Lucas, Ninten has yet to appear as a playable character in the Super Smash Bros. series.Etymology  Ninten's name is derived from the name Nintendo (only without the \"do\"), the company that published and developed the Mother series. The name 'Ninten' was used by Nintendo as a placeholder name in guides and suchlike for many games in the 1990's. Among the other generic titles the characters received in the instruction manual, Ninten himself was referred to as 'Boku', Japanese for \"Me\", in order to leave his name entirely up to the player. Screenshots and player's guides used \"Ninten\" as the main character's name, and it has since been adopted as his official name. In the Japanese Mother novel adaptation, however, he was called Ken.Trivia Kumatora  Kumatora (\u30af\u30de\u30c8\u30e9) is one of the main characters in Mother 3. She is the only playable character and permanent member of Lucas' party who is female. She can use many powerful PSI abilities. She is a tomboy, in contrast with previous games' female party members (Paula and Ana) who were stereotypically feminine characters. This is most likely due to her being raised by the extremely feminine Ionia, a Magypsy. Kumatora is called the princess of Osohe Castle, although she doesn't actually have any royal blood. In fact, Kumatora was only named princess by the Magypsies after they were asked to care for her by the people on board the White Ship.Personality  True to her tomboyish nature, Kumatora is tough, to the point where she refuses to cry until the game's ending (this could be a reference to a sentence in MOTHER's commercial, saying in Japanese, \"There's no crying until the end.\") She is also rude, calling Wess by the term, \"old geezer\", quickly commenting on Duster's bad breath and calling Fassad a \"cheap bastard\". She can also be rather impulsive - while trapped in Osohe Castle, she seriously considers cutting off her leg while it was caught in a bear trap and\u00a0took the Egg of Light before Wess could warn her about the traps attached to it. However, during rough situations, Kumatora does prove to be nice and caring in regards to the rest of the party, and also to others- as she went on to help Salsa escape from Fassad's abuse. She also has a resourceful streak, using her waitress disguise to remain undercover after the Pigmasks take over Nowhere Islands (though she expresses a firm distaste for them).Appearance  Kumatora is portrayed as a teenager but can be slightly older. She is a hot pink haired girl with a tough yet somewhat feminine appearence, wearing a turquoise full sleeved hoodie with baby blue collars and wrists, which reaches slightly above her knees like a short dress would. She wears cherry-red boots and has her hair styled in pixie cut which has a spiked back and front side bang. She is shown to wear winged eyeliner and magenta lipstick in her clay figure. During her in-game appearance, she is shown to have a pendant and ribbon equipped, which she apparently wears- unless the player changes it. During her disguise as a waitress, she wears her hair in a girlish manner, tied with a golden band. She also wears a white and pink dress, which she reveals to hate. She wears white shoes and violet eyeshadow. Her height also increases after the time skip.Story  Kumatora was a young infant when she arrived at Nowhere Island in the White Ship, having no parents to take care of her, the Magypsies decided to take care of her, which resulted in Kumatora gaining the knowledge of various PSI moves. She was decided to be made the Princess of the Osohe Castle, although, in haste, not much backstory was provided for her. Kumatora first appears in Chapter 2; while Duster makes his way through Osohe Castle in search of the Noble Spitoon, she drops from a ceiling, landing and dashing through the nearby door. She drops her pendant in the process, which Duster takes. Kumatora is seen again when Duster later returns with Wess; as they enter a room, they find her with her leg caught in a bear trap. She fires a blast of PK Freeze at them, but suddenly recognizes Wess and apologizes, instead musing on whether or not to cut her leg off somehow. Wess and Duster free her and return her pendant, and she joins them out of gratitude, at which point the player can name her. The trio continues through the castle and eventually find the Egg of Light; unfortunately, the Pigmasks pursue them and attempt to barge into the room, prompting her to grab the egg and tripping a trapdoor that sends them plummeting into the room below. Upon meeting and defeating the Oh-So-Snake, a drain opens (later revealed to be pulled by Salsa in Chapter 3), and all three of them are sucked out. Wess and Kumatora end up on a shore in Tazmily Village and are nursed back to health at Lighter and Fuel's house. They head out to the town square in search of Duster and the Egg of Light, who are both nowhere to be found, and discover that Butch and the other villagers suspect him of stealing a bag of money from the well; the bag of money was given to Butch (and revealed to be stolen from him) by Fassad. As Wess and Kumatora defend Duster's reputation (with Kumatora threatening to beat the snot out of Butch), Fassad shows up and takes advantages of the situation by using Salsa to sell Happy Boxes to the villagers. As he tries to sell one to Kumatora, she reads Salsa's mind and senses his plight, promising to rescue him. Kumatora and Wess later free Salsa from his bonds, and are forced to escape with him from Fassad and a group of Pigmask Soldiers. They run into Sunshine Forest, where she and the others are forced to fight off a Pork Tank. Despite defeating the colossal machine, Kumatora's group ends up surrounded by Pigmasks, but they are bailed out in the nick of time by Lucas and a duo of Dragos (one adult and the baby), who drive off the Pigmasks for the time being, ending Chapter 3. Three years later, Kumatora is revealed to have become a waitress at Club Titiboo, where she goes by the name of Violet (Yoshikoshi in the Japanese version). \u00a0After Duster (who goes by the name 'Lucky' at that point) joins the party, Kumatora joins the party as well, as they go out to search for the Egg of Light. At this point, she goes out and beats up the guards of the Club- once again showing her feisty nature. At this point, Chapter 4 ends. With start of Chapter 5, Kumatora, along with the rest the party members, continue the search for Egg of Light- after finding which, they head over to Thunder Tower- and realize the reason for the erratic lightning across Tazmily Village, they go on the shut off the tower, which, after they are successful in, end in a cutscene where they encounter Fassad. He mocks them and attempts to leave via a helicopter- while leaving the team on the crumbling tower, but slips on the banana peel he threw, falling off the tower. The team then clings onto the helicopter's ladder using Rope Snake and flies off a distance, until The Masked Man notices them and\u00a0attempts to shake them off by shaking the helicopter. He succeeds and the team ends up falling in different places, ending Chapter 5. Kumatora has no appearance in Chapter 6. Kumatora is found in Doria's house later during Chapter 7, who saved her after she fell, and joins the team later on. The rest of Chapter 7 is spent finding the Needles, and Kumatora remains in the party at all times. Near the end, after defeating Masked Man for the first time and pulling the Needle, Ionia teaches Kumatora PK Starstorm, one of the strongest attacks in the game. In Chapter 8, Kumatora, along with the party members, explores the New Pork city- but as a silent party member. Until the pulling off the last Needle, she doesn't have any extra role to play. After the game ends, she is notably crying in the secret ending, as said by one of the characters.In Battle  Kumatora primarily uses\u00a0Gloves\u00a0as weapons.\u00a0Compared to other members of the party, Kumatora's normal attacks are weaker. However, Kumatora can use many powerful PSI attacks as\u00a0her stats are designed to support her role as the party's main PK user; she can use PK Fire, PK Freeze, PK Thunder, PK Starstorm, and PK Ground. She also learns Healing, Lifeup, and PSI Magnet, and Assist PSI like Offense Down, Defense Down, Brainshock, Hypnosis, and Paralysis.In Super Smash Bros. Super Smash Bros. Brawl  Kumatora appears in Super Smash Bros. Brawl as a sticker. Attaching this sticker to Ness or Lucas's trophies in The Subspace Emissary increases their PK attack by 11.Super Smash Bros. Ultimate  Kumatora appears with Boney when Lucas uses PK Starstorm, his final smash. She also appears as an attack type advanced level primary spirit in the new Spirits mode. Her spirit has two support slots.Trivia EarthBound Beginnings  EarthBound Beginnings (Japanese: \u30de\u30b6\u30fc Mother) is the first installment in the Mother series. It was developed by Ape Inc., Nintendo Tokyo R&D Products, and Pax Softnica, and was published by Nintendo for the Famicom on July 27, 1989. For its Japanese release, the game was known by the title, \"Mother\". It was designed and directed by Shigesato Itoi and produced by Shigeru Miyamoto, with music by Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu Tanaka. In 1990, EarthBound Beginnings was fully translated by Nintendo of America and slated for a 1991 release outside of Japan as \"EARTH BOUND\". However, due to marketing issues and the approaching release of the SNES, the game was not released in other territories. It took many more years for the game to be released overseas. In Japan, the game was re-released on the Game Boy Advance in a compilation with its sequel, Mother 2 (\"EarthBound\") as Mother 1 + 2. June 14, 2015, 25 years after being released in Japan, Earthbound Beginnings was released in North America and Europe for the first time on the Wii U Virtual Console. Itoi stated that the reason for the release was because of the fanbase's dedication. EarthBound Beginnings is a release of the original, unreleased NES translation, and contains all of its changes from the original releases, a trait shared with Mother 1 + 2.Gameplay\u00a0  EarthBound Beginnings' gameplay is divided into two main parts: the overworld and the game's battle system. EarthBound Beginnings does not use a small-scale overworld map and instead connects towns, dungeons, and other places together with large outdoor areas. When in towns on the field map players can talk with non-player characters, go to stores to buy equipment or items, rest in hotels, or enter other various buildings. By using any telephone in the game, Ninten, the protagonist, can talk to his dad, who deposits money into Ninten's bank account and offers to save his progress. When outside of towns on the field map or while inside dungeons, the party will encounter enemies in random battles. There are a handful of exceptions wherein the party can be attacked while in the sanctuary of a town, examples being the zombies masquerading as townsfolk in Podunk, the enemy infested streets of downtown Spookane, and the B.B. Gang members in Ellay. When in battle, the game switches to a first-person view, only showing the enemies and a menu system used to issue commands. Actions are chosen for each character by the player, and the characters and enemies will take turns performing the actions in an order determined by their speed statistics. Winning battles awards experience points, which characters require to level up. Leveling up increases a character's stats and lets them learn more abilities. If a character loses all of their hit points, they will become \"unconscious\" and the player must go to a hospital and pay to revive them.\u00a0After a full-party defeat, Ninten is revived at the last location at which the player saved but with 0 PP (Psychic Points).Plot Characters and Setting  EarthBound Beginnings tells the story of Ninten, a 12-year-old boy from Podunk, who journeys around America using his psychic powers to collect eight melodies in order to save the planet from an evil race of mind-controlling aliens. Along the way he is joined by four friends; a brilliant-minded young boy\u00a0tormented at his school for being a weakling, a PSI-powered girl whose mother mysteriously went missing, a gang leader whose parents were murdered, and a young but powerful tomboy girl who he rescues from a cemetery. They meet many unusual characters and visit strange settings before ultimately confronting the leader of the aliens, Giegue. On his journey, Ninten visits many towns and locations such as Merrysville, Spookane, and Ellay to name just a few. He also visits the mysterious land of Magicant and must scale Mt. Itoi to his final battle.Story  EarthBound Beginnings is a mostly non-linear game and not all the possible events or characters must be encountered to complete the game, nor do they need to be encountered in the order described below. This summary is of the intended sequence of events but is not representative of every players' experience. Also note that there are several story differences between the 1989 Famicom release and the 1990 English translation, which is used as the basis of all re-releases of the game. The extended ending, arguably the game's largest story modification, is noted in this section; all other plot alterations are listed in \"Censorship and Localization.\" For the sake of following Nintendo of America's official stance on the MOTHER trilogy, the 1990 version of the game's plot is described here. In the early 1900's, a dark shadow covered a small country town in rural America. George and Maria, a young couple, mysteriously vanished, having been abducted by aliens. While in captivity, George and Maria raised Giegue, an alien infant, as if he were their own child. While Maria raised Giegue like how a mother would raise her son, George illicitly studied the aliens' PSI powers, suddenly returning to Earth two years later. He refused to tell anyone where he had been or what he had done but resumed his odd studies by himself. Maria, however, never returned. The aliens, angry at George's theft of their knowledge, order Giegue to reclaim it from Earth and ensure it is not used against them by humans. Although Giegue is distraught at having to attack his family, he reluctantly follows through... Eighty years later, in the rural American town of Podunk lives a 12-year-old boy named Ninten, with his mother and two sisters, Mimmie and Minnie. His story begins when his home is seemingly attacked by a poltergeist, who possesses two Lamps and a Doll. After the objects are defeated, Ninten's father calls him, explaining that George, now revealed to be Ninten's great-grandfather, studied PSI. Ninten's father then tasks him with investigating a series of strange phenomena occurring across America, leaving Ninten to go out on his own. After returning a canary chick to its mother and rescuing & befriending a 7-year-old girl named Pippi from the local cemetery, Ninten is sent to investigate the escaping and sudden hostility of the animals in the local zoo. There, he discovers the phenomena are the work of an invading alien race. Ninten is then warped to the world of Magicant, where the land's ruler, Queen Mary, has recently started to experience horrible nightmares. When she meets Ninten, she asks him to find her song, the Eight Melodies, and play them to her, as she has forgotten the song and desperately needs to remember it. After returning to his world, Ninten visits an elementary school in Merrysville and meets an 11-year-old boy named Lloyd, who is constantly bullied for being a weakling. Ninten befriends Lloyd and joins Ninten on his adventure to find the Eight Melodies. The two then travel to the town of Snowman to deliver a lost hat to an 11-year-old girl with PSI powers named Ana, who tells Ninten that she saw him in a dream and joins the party in hopes of finding her missing mother. The group then continues their investigations in Youngtown, where all but two of the adults were abducted by a U.F.O. Having learned this, they decide to continue onward and further investigate these coinciding phenomena. After finding five to six of the melodies (three of which Ninten found in Podunk, prior to his first visit to Magicant), Ninten, Ana, and Lloyd wind up in the city of Ellay, where they learn that strange, black clouds have appeared over Mt. Itoi. However, during the trio's investigations, they are harassed by members of the Bla Bla Gang, a powerful street gang who attacks anyone that provokes them. After overcoming these thugs, the trio performs karaoke at the Live House. However, their performance is interrupted by the Bla Bla Gang's leader, who is angered by the fact that the trio was beating up his lackeys. The leader then challenges Ninten to a duel, only to quickly realize how powerful of an opponent Ninten is. Swearing defeat, the leader introduces himself as Teddy and explains that his parents were killed by wild animals on Mt. Itoi. Seeking vengeance, he joins Ninten's party, replacing Lloyd, who rests up at the live house. Teddy then instructs the group to climb the mountain and avenge his parents. The trio then treks up the mountain, facing numerous formidable foes along their way. Eventually, they rest at a cabin, the only place where they can currently find safety. There, Ana leads Ninten into a quiet room, where the two dance and confess their love for each other. However, Teddy interrupts them, pointing out strange noises coming from outside. When they look out the window to investigate, they are immediately attacked by R7038, an upgraded version of a similar robot encountered earlier on in the game. R7038 brutally devastates the trio, but Lloyd suddenly appears in a tank borrowed from a war veteran in the Yucca Desert. He destroys the robot with a single shot from the cannon, but is slightly off-mark and hits his friends as well. Lloyd then transports the trio back to the cottage, where Teddy is critically damaged from the fight. Teddy realizes that one cannot win all battles simply using brute force, and stays in the cottage to heal. Lloyd then rejoins the party in Teddy's stead. Continuing their trek up Mt. Itoi, the trio is sucked into a whirlpool while trying to cross a lake in the center of the mountain path. The whirlpool brings the trio to George's abandoned underground laboratory, where they find a large robot named EVE. EVE explains that she was built with the purpose of protecting Ninten in his time of need, and joins the trio on their adventure. The glass windows in the lab then give way, flooding the lab and whisking the party back to dry land. The quartet then continues their trek, learning that EVE is so powerful that she can kill enemies in a single blow. However, she is soon challenged by R7038XX, an upgraded variation of R7038. R7038XX and EVE then duel on the mountain, R7038XX gaining the upper hand. However, as a last resort, EVE self-destructs, destroying R7038XX in the process. The remaining trio then finds a chip in EVE that plays the seventh of the Eight Melodies. They continue up the mountain until they reach a cliff near the peak, where they find a cave barricaded by several immovable rocks. Along with the cave, they find George's gravesite, where his spirit contacts Ninten and relays to him the final melody. Ninten and co. then head back to Magicant, where they relay the full song back to Queen Mary. Not only does Mary remember the song, but she also remembers that her true identity is Maria, George's wife and Giegue's former caretaker from 80 years ago. She explains that she sang the Eight Melodies to Giegue as a lullaby and that she and Giegue loved each other very much, akin to a mother and her son. Realizing her true identity, Maria passes on, as Magicant slowly dissipates; it was only a figment of Maria's imagination... When Ninten, Ana, and Lloyd return to the real world, they find that the rocks blocking the cavern are gone, allowing them to enter. Inside, they find a room filled with alien pods containing numerous adults, many of whom were abducted from Youngtown. One adult recognizes Ana from her hat and explains that her mother is being held in a room in the back. However, it is also explained that it is impossible to free anyone without defeating Giegue first. With this in mind, the trio then continues through the cavern and reaches the summit. There, Giegue appears in his mothership and attacks the trio, explaining his backstory all the while, and expresses his gratitude for Ninten's family, as Maria raised Giegue when he was but a child. While he initially reprimands Ninten for obstructing his plans, Giegue offers to spare Ninten's life, should he board the mothership with him. However, Ninten refuses, and an angered Giegue then attacks the trio further, stating that they can \"fall into a long sleep with the rest of the ugly Earth people\". When the trio tries to fight back with force, they are unable to defeat him, no matter how much they attack. However, upon checking the alien, Teddy's realization from before comes into place: Maria's spirit explains that Giegue cannot be defeated with brute force, and can only be defeated by the singing of the Eight Melodies. With this in mind, the trio repeatedly tries to sing the Eight Melodies, yet are attacked by Giegue, who hopes to silence him to escape his old conflictions. However, after ten failed attempts, one member of the trio (determined by the player's actions during the battle) manages to sing the entire lullaby. Unable to bear the pain of the memories induced by the melodies, Giegue is defeated, and flies back to the cosmos, swearing that he will have his revenge. In the original Famicom release, the game abruptly ends at this uncertain point: Ninten and co. will face the screen as the credits roll behind them. However, the 1990 English localization (and, by extension, all re-releases of the game) significantly extends the game's ending, with the assumption that the player followed the plot as described above. After Giegue's defeat, the adults in the cavern are freed and brought back to their families in Youngtown, while Ana reunites with her mother and returns to Snowman. The group then parts ways, and each member continues with their own life. Lloyd is given a hero's welcome back in Merrysville and is no longer bullied by his peers. Teddy, now fully recovered, changes his ways and becomes a live performer at the Live House in Ellay. In Snowman, Ana receives a letter from Ninten and eagerly hopes to meet him again. Back in Podunk, Ninten is greeted by his family, who infer that Ninten must be famished after his long journey. Now that the earth's crisis is finally over, Ninten decides to lay down and go to sleep. This extended ending finishes off with a cast of all the characters who appeared in person\u00a0in the game (minus Giegue, standard enemies, and bosses), a new credits sequence, and a post-credits scene: Ninten's father tries to call Ninten, apparently with urgent news, implying that a new problem needing investigation has arisen...Development  EarthBound Beginnings was designed and directed by famed Japanese copywriter and television personality Shigesato Itoi. The game's original release was named after John Lennon's song \"Mother\", which moved Itoi so much that he wanted other people to be moved in the same way. Itoi could heavily relate to the song, which dealt with Lennon's experiences growing up without either of his parents; Itoi's own father was absent for much of his life. Because of this, he chose to isolate the role of Ninten's father as simply a voice on a telephone, a role that would be inherited by Ness's father in EarthBound. Itoi also felt that \"MOTHER\" was a fitting title for the game, as it was noticeably more \"feminine\" than most RPGs. A proposal for the game was initially presented to Shigeru Miyamoto, who rejected it due to the commercial failure of other celebrity-produced Famicom games. Itoi was so upset that he cried on the train ride home. However, he later received a callback from Miyamoto, thereby commencing development. Shigesato Itoi, the game's designer, has said that the last parts of EarthBound Beginnings were not tested for bugs and balance issues due to time constraints. When talking about this at a Mother 1 + 2 promotional event, Itoi humorously stated, \"When we got to fine-tuning the difficulty there [Mt. Itoi], I was like, 'Whatever!'\" The game was released in Japan again on June 20, 2003, as part of the Game Boy Advance compilation Mother 1 + 2. Nintendo published Mother 1 + 2 with the intention of advertising the upcoming Mother 3. It retained the censorship of the unreleased translation and other changes, such as the names of towns.English release  Before the release of the game twenty five years later, Nintendo of America had originally planned to translate and release Mother in the United States under the title Earth Bound. The localization was completed in 1990, but marketing pushed the release into fall of 1991, and it was eventually cancelled. The Localization Producer and English Script Writer for Earth Bound, Phil Sandhop, explained, \"Once the Super NES squatted in the pipeline and shoved the game aside from its appointed time, I believe that the marketing execs just decided that the game would be too expensive to produce and unsuccessful without marketing, and that's why it fell into oblivion.\" However, the project's failure was not in vain. In response to the extensive changes made to MOTHER, Nintendo began making more of their games with an international audience in mind; often, a game would be pre-localized even after its Japanese release before being sent to Nintendo's overseas studios. In 1998, the fan translation group Demiforce found a beta cartridge of the game on eBay and organized an effort to collect enough money to buy the game. The project was a success, and soon after, the game was dumped into a ROM and circulated around the internet. Due to a glitch with the most accurate emulator of the time, Demiforce hacked the game while also appending \"Zero\" onto the title to retroactively discern it from its sequel, EarthBound. This hack ran in NESticle, but also triggered a new anti-piracy message at two key points in the game; the game was since further hacked to prevent such issues. Since Demiforce had built its reputation on releasing their English translations out of the blue, some fans debated whether the cartridge had been translated by Nintendo or by Demiforce themselves. However, today it is generally agreed that the cartridge is legitimate, as Mother 1 + 2 and\u00a0EarthBound Beginnings contain all of the changes found in the beta cartridge. During 2007, Tomato, better known within the Mother series fan community for his involvement with The Unofficial Mother 3 Fan Translation, began work on a remake which used the graphic engine of its successor, EarthBound. This made the game's maps complicated to work on, and on August 6, 2008, Tomato said of the development's progress, \"I already made most of the necessary tools, and as you can see, I had all of the enemies, the entire script, all the items [...] But the problem is the maps, and without a reliable map editor, it's just not gonna happen.\" His resources were then designated to providing an alternate translation, which he recently released as part of Mother 1 + 2. Nearly 26 years after being released in Japan, Mother was released in the United States and Europe as EarthBound Beginnings on June 14, 2015. It is fully translated into English, using the same ROM as the unreleased NES prototype and the Mother 1 + 2 release.Music  EarthBound Beginnings' soundtrack was composed by Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu Tanaka. The music was released on compact disc and cassette tape by Sony Records on August 21, 1989. It consists of eleven tracks, seven of which have vocals. Some of the game's notable songs include \"Eight Melodies\", which plays a heavy role in the story, and \"Pollyanna\". Both have lyrical versions on the album, sung by St. Paul's Cathedral Choir and Catherine Warwick, respectively. On February 18, 2004, the soundtrack was re-released with digitally remastered tracks. Songs from EarthBound Beginnings appear in EarthBound, Mother 3, Super Smash Bros. Melee and Super Smash Bros. Brawl in their original or remixed form.Censorship and Localization  During the localization from the Japanese Mother to the English EarthBound Beginnings, many names and graphics were changed, as well as features added. Shigesato Itoi was heavily involved with this localization and many if not all of the changes were approved by him. Most changes are to reduce difficulty, adhere to the strict censorship policies that Nintendo of America enforced from 1985 to 1994, and make the game more accessible for English speakers.Reception  EarthBound Beginnings was successful in Japan, selling approximately 400,000 copies. In two polls conducted by Famitsu, it was rated as the 9th best game on the Famicom and the 38th best game of all time. The game was the listed as the fourth most-wanted Virtual Console release in the first month of a poll by Nintendo Power. It is currently residing in the number two spot, behind EarthBound. In a Mother 1 + 2 review, Netjak praised the modern setting and broad themes, calling the game, \"quite dark and mature.\" Jeremy Parish from 1UP.com states, \"the game balance is completely ridiculous, relying far too heavily on picking up better weapons and grinding for far too long.\"External links Unused Boss (Mother 3)  The unused boss character in Mother 3 is a source of major speculation within the Mother community. It may have been intended to be used in a darker version of the final battle, and is speculated by some to be a representation of how Lucas sees Claus throughout the battle. A creepy breathing sound has been noticed by hackers, along with what was possibly the boss's battle music and screaming.Accessing the battles  In order to battle the unused enemies, in the cheat code menu of emulators such as VisualBoyAdvance, 020047EC must be entered in the address bar and one of its enemy modifier codes must be entered in the value bar. The codes must be put in with 8-bit size and the number format on \"Hexadecimal\". These codes vary between its numerous forms. They are CB (its standard form, called Dung Beetle), CC (its yellow angel form, called Tent Person), CD (naked Claus, called Snow Bunny), CE (Claus clothed, called Clayman), F1 (Same as Clayman, but with a different background transition, called Sign), CF (an undulating red X, called Vapor), D1 (close-up of adolescent Claus, called Rope Snake), D2 (Kid Claus made of pixels, called Aeolia's Table), D3 (close-up of adolescent Claus outlined in red, called Straw), D4 (a face almost alike the Facepunch Studios logo without any facial parts but eyes, nose and mouth, called Vapor 2), D5 (Same as Vapor 2 but without a nose, called Mini Elevator), F0 (Lucas and Claus, called Train) and F2 (naked and albino Claus resembling Giygas, also called Sign). While this code is active, the player must encounter an enemy. Instead of beginning a battle with the expected enemy, the battle with the unused boss will immediately begin.Forms  The unused boss projects itself as Lucas's worst nightmare \u2013 a deformed, robotic version of his twin brother Claus. During the battle, it changes into several different forms. Aside from its standard form, these are a yellow angel, Claus naked (and again later with the pallet of its normal form), Claus clothed, both Lucas and Claus, a large, screaming Claus with no pupils or irises (and again later as a red outline), and a head resembling that of Claus' which lacks all features except eyes a nose and a mouth.Abilities  The unused boss' abilities vary between forms. Of note is a PSI ability that was likely scrapped during the development of Mother 3, which is simply called \"PK\u00a0?\" (blank line). Its nature is similar to PSI Flash, as it targets all of the boss' opponents and causes adverse effects including poison and nausea. There are certain forms of the boss which have no abilities (such as Straw) and are thus unable to inflict damage on the party members. Various other forms of the boss possess different levels of this unused PK attack; Snow Bunny, for instance, uses only PK \u03a9 (Hypnosis \u03a9), which puts all party members to sleep. Dung Beetle uses PK \u03b2, which poisons all party members. Tent Person uses PK \u03b3, which causes paralysis to all party members.Stats  Many of the boss's earlier (as listed above) forms share the same stat sets, while later forms have much weaker stats. Slightly more detailed information on the stats can be found on the List of unused and glitch enemies in Mother 3 page.Drops Trivia External links References PSI  PSI (Psionics) or PK (Psychokinesis) refers to the psychic powers that appear throughout the Mother series. The numerous PSI-wielding allies and enemies throughout the series each have their own array of PSI powers that they are able to draw from. As characters level up, they will gain access to successively stronger variants of their PSI moves. The power level of a given PSI move is designated by a Greek letter; in ascending order of power, the tiers are Alpha (\u03b1), Beta (\u03b2), Gamma (\u03b3), Pi (\u03c0) or\u00a0Sigma (\u03a3), and Omega (\u03a9). PSI abilities can be compartmentalized into four different categories: Giygas's species and their allies are known to be proficient at PSI, and George is stated to have been studying the power some decades prior to the events of Mother. In EarthBound, various enemy types\u2014humans, animals, aliens, and even inanimate objects\u2014are able to use PSI, potentially as a result of Giygas's influence. Additionally, the Dalaamese seem to have developed the ability to tap into PSI on their own. In Mother 3, the use of PSI abilities is generally limited to the Magypsies and their students, with rare exception. While the Magypsies have apparently been using it for centuries, it is worth noting that Mother 3 is implied to take place far into the future from the first two games in the series. The effects of some PSI moves differ from game to game, and their description in a given section will cover what they do in that specific game.PSI abilities in EarthBound Beginnings PSI abilities in EarthBound PSI abilities in Mother 3 Unused dummy PSI in Mother 3  These can only be used by the Unused Boss. Double-spaces are present between \"PK\" and the ability's rank, potentially as a result of formatting codes used when printing the names onscreen, or to accommodate for proper names for the abilities that were never implemented.Trivia Paula  Paula Jones (Japanese: \u30dd\u30fc\u30e9\u30fb\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30f3\u30ba Paula Jones) is one of the playable characters in EarthBound. She is the first to join Ness, and the only female member of Ness's team. She usually uses frying pans as her primary weapon, along with many powerful PSI powers. Her HP and defense are rather low, but she has high PP and is the fastest of the playable characters. She has a Pray ability, which calls forth one of many possible random effects in battle. There are several characters in the game that believe Ness and Paula are dating; from Ness's Mother to Jeff Andonuts, the latter says so at the end of the game.Biography  Paula is a resident of Twoson in the country of Eagleland, and the daughter of the owners of the local Polestar Preschool, when she joins the adventure. Ness is made aware of her existence when he goes to sleep at any location after visiting the \"Your Sanctuary\" location at Giant Step, when she contacts him through her telepathy in a dream. She was kidnapped by a masked boy and Pokey Minch, and brought to Peaceful Rest Valley to become the high priestess for Happy Happyism (although Everdred claims she was kidnapped to be a human sacrifice). She gifts the Franklin Badge to Ness so he may challenge and defeat Carpainter, get the key to where she is imprisoned, and free her. After she is freed, she joins Ness's party. She is later kidnapped by Geldegarde Monotoli, but as before, Ness rescues her, this time with the help of Jeff. Paula's Pray command is ultimately a key part of the game, as she must use it nine times to defeat Giygas in the final battle.Personality  Paula is portrayed as a kind, fairly weak and cutesy girl in the original release, to the point where she states she almost cried when she was locked up. However, Marcus Lindblom had stated that he revised Paula's character during localization to be a more forceful, capable and \"willing to destroy\" character.In Super Smash Bros. Brawl  Paula appears in Super Smash Bros. Brawl as a sticker. Attaching this sticker to the bottom of Ness or Lucas's trophies in The Subspace Emissary increases their PK attack by 10.In Super Smash Bros. Ultimate  Paula appears with Poo when Ness uses PK Starstorm.Trivia Characters  This category is for all characters in the Mother series.Poo  Poo (\u30d7\u30fc P\u016b) is a playable character in EarthBound. He is the third and final playable character to join Ness. Poo has a wide variety of offensive and defensive PSI, along with being decent at attack and defense, and has a noticeable resistance to PSI Fire and PSI Freeze. His drawback is that he can only equip items from the \"of Kings\" set (the Diadem of Kings, the Cloak of Kings, the Sword of Kings and the Bracer of Kings). Poo cannot use any weapons except his fists, the yo-yos, slingshots (both of which lower his attack) and a weapon exclusive to his use, the Sword of Kings. He has a unique ability called mirror, which allows him to become any enemy in the game during battles, with the notable exception of bosses. Poo undergoes a special diet, meaning that he can't eat any Western-style foods and recovers few hit points or psychic points from ingesting such items. However, he can drink bottles of water to recover much more psychic points than other characters would, and Eastern foods more effectively restore his HP than they do for any other character.Biography  As the Crown Prince of Dalaam, he has undergone strict martial arts training. Poo is first introduced after Ness eats the Magic Cake, and he completes his training by meditation, which he maintains despite a spirit breaking various parts of his body. Poo then teleports to Summers and declares his allegiance to Ness. Poo is taken from the party after they come up from the exit of the Pyramid in Scaraba by the Star Master, who shows him the powerful PSI Starstorm \u03b1, which he uses to defeat Master Barf. Poo is a solemn dedicated warrior, but is loyal to his friends and bringing peace to the world. Interestingly enough, Poo is very popular with the girls in Dalaam.In the Super Smash Bros. Series In Super Smash Bros. Melee  Poo appears as a trophy in Super Smash Bros. Melee, with the text Poo, the crown prince of the mysterious eastern country of Dalaam, joined Ness after completing rigorous training in his home country. While he doesn't stand out among Ness's friends, his vast experience and strong willpower make him a key to their success. Poo can assume the form of an enemy to gain its powers.In Super Smash Bros. Brawl  Poo appears in Super Smash Bros. Brawl as a sticker. Attaching this sticker to the bottom of Ness or Lucas's trophies in The Subspace Emissary increases their PK attack by 9.In Super Smash Bros. Ultimate  Poo appears with Paula when Ness uses PK Starstorm.Trivia Jeff Andonuts  Jeff Andonuts (\u30b8\u30a7\u30d5 Jefu) is one of the playable characters in EarthBound, the second to join Ness. Jeff is the only permanent party member who is unable to use PSI abilities. To compensate for that, he can repair broken objects to turn into useful machines and weapons for battle, although what exactly he can repair is based on his IQ level and the broken items he has in his inventory. He usually uses Guns as his primary weapons, along with bottle rockets and the aforementioned repaired gadgets such as the Hungry HP-Sucker, Heavy Bazooka, Neutralizer, and Shield Killer. He also has the Spy ability, allowing him to look up enemy attributes and snatch away their drop item if they have one.Biography  Jeff is the genius son of the great scientist Dr. Andonuts, and attends the Snow Wood Boarding School in Winters, FoggyLand. Paula communicates with him telepathically to rescue them from captivity in Threed. After acquiring the Sky Runner from his father, Jeff travels to Threed and rescues Ness and Paula, securing his place as one of the chosen four.In Super Smash Bros. Brawl  Jeff appears in Super Smash Bros. Brawl as a sticker based off his clay model, with the distinct change of his outfit's color and that he is looking up. Attaching this sticker to the bottom of Ness or Lucas's trophies in The Subspace Emissary increases their PK attack by 24. He also appears as an Assist Trophy, launching bottle rockets at his opponents.Trivia PK Love  PK Love\u00a0is a PSI ability in Mother 3 that works on all enemies. Aeolia notes in passing that she taught Claus a super-powerful PSI technique, and Ionia, who helps Lucas realize how to use PSI techniques, is impressed at his ability to use PK Love, as even the Magypsies are unable to master it. At its \u03a9 level, its power is rivaled only by PK Starstorm, PSI Rockin, and (to an extent) PK Freeze \u03a9. PK Love is learned in Mother 3 by only Lucas and Claus. Like Ness's PSI Rockin ability from EarthBound, PK Love can be given a unique name by the player, when asked what the player's favorite thing is before the story begins. Also, \"Love\" is one of the default names for PSI Rockin. The Magypsies cannot wield this ability, as it is used to pull the Needles they are guarding and awaken the Dark Dragon under the Nowhere Islands as an out-of-battle effect. In battle, it appears as harsh, shining pink and turquoise lights with a hexagonal pattern (with the exception of the \u03b1 stage).Trivia Mr. Saturn  The Mr. Saturn (\u3069\u305b\u3044\u3055\u3093 Dosei-san) are a species in EarthBound and Mother 3 and serve as the unofficial mascot for the trilogy. They are strange, possibly extra-terrestrial life forms who reside in both Eagleland's Saturn Valley and the Nowhere Islands's Saturn Valley in EarthBound and Mother 3, respectively. They are characterized by huge noses, four whiskers, and a single hair with a small red bow. They are generally very peaceful and generous, offering free coffee and stays at the hotel. They speak Saturnian (composed of odd-looking English letters), and in the English translation erratically use the words \"boing\", \"ding\" and \"zoom\" at the ends of their sentences. The Japanese font is said to be inspired by the handwriting of the young daughter of EarthBound's designer, Shigesato Itoi. Of Mr. Saturn, Itoi has stated that the race is the symbol of innocence in EarthBound. The Mr. Saturns are often said to have no gender, although a Mr. Saturn in Saturn Valley's cave in Mother 3 exclaims \"Girl. I am girl.\" Their village has round homes which resemble flying saucers and strange furniture, such as Automatic Teller Machines which bounce up and down in place and resemble Mr. Saturn. Some of the Mr. Saturns' preferred foods are \"peanut cheese bars\" and \"piggy jelly\", goods that can be purchased in the Saturn Valley shop.Biography EarthBound  The Mr. Saturns play a major story role in EarthBound. Nearly all of the Mr. Saturn live in Saturn Valley beyond Grapefruit Falls (though there is one living back in Happy Happy Village and another in Onett). When Ness, Paula and Jeff first arrive in Saturn Valley, several are missing. They provide information relating to Master Belch and his Fly Honey factory. Ness and his friends get into the factory to find that Belch has enslaved some of the Mr. Saturn, forcing them to make fly honey for him. When Belch is defeated and the Mr. Saturn are freed, Ness and friends gain access to the upper part of Saturn Valley and the Your Sanctuary location Milky Well, then they can proceed to Fourside. Later in the game, Dr. Andonuts, Apple Kid, and the Mr. Saturn design the Phase Distorter in Saturn Valley to enable Ness and company to travel through time back to the past, in order to confront Giygas. They are the first to pray for the chosen four during the final boss fight.Mother 3  The Mr. Saturns have a much smaller story role in Mother 3. Again, the Mr. Saturns live in a place called Saturn Valley, which is located nearby one of the Highway exits. They are initially captured by the Pigmask Army, so that the Mr. Saturns would confess the location of the fourth Needle. Lucas and co. rescue them from the Pigmask Army and their Frightbots, and in return they tell him where to find the Needle. After the party defeats New Fassad and Lucas lifts the fourth Needle, they return to Saturn Valley, only to find that a Pigmask has blocked off the exit. Lucas and friends escape the valley when, with the help of Rope Snake, who sees this as an opportunity to redeem himself, they grab hold of a cage of captured birds. A Mr. Saturn later gives Lucas a polished Courage Badge, which is actually a Franklin Badge. Dr. Andonuts and the Mr. Saturns are also responsible for designing the Absolutely Safe Capsule to be used by Pokey Minch in times of desperation. It is unknown how they manage to have such mechanical skills despite their lack of arms.Super Smash Bros. series Item  In Super Smash Bros. Melee, Super Smash Bros. Brawl and Super Smash Bros. for Wii U and 3DS, Mr. Saturn appears as an item. After spawning or being released from a container, it sits in place for a few seconds, then walks around. It is often seen as a \"joke item\", in that it has no special use aside from being thrown at an enemy character for a few points of damage. It can also be damaged by attacks which sends it flying. The Mr. Saturn can also be caught in mid-throw and tossed back at opponents. Though commonly overlooked, there is one thing Mr. Saturn is good for, which is breaking shields. In Super Smash Bros. Brawl, its description in the Item Switch is simply, \"Pwaaaaah. Pwaaaaah,\" and it is categorized as a throwing item.Sticker  In Super Smash Bros. Brawl, there are two Mr. Saturn stickers. One is fairly large, featuring his clay model from EarthBound, and the other is his sprite in Mother 3. Attaching the former to any character's trophy base will make the character always spawn holding a Mr. Saturn in The Subspace Emissary, while the latter will increase the power of Ness and Lucas's PK moves by 7.Trophy Quotes Super Smash Bros. Melee  \"The origins of the Mr. Saturn race are unknown. But many believe that they come from outer space. They are found in Saturn Valley and speak their own unique language. In Super Smash Bros. Melee, Mr. Saturn is just another item with which to pelt foes. These guys are laid back and not into fighting, so you can rest easy... or can you?\"Super Smash Bros. Brawl  \"A creature from a race of unknown origin that speaks its own unique language. Some say they came from outer space, but the facts behind their appearance are wrapped in mystery. In Smash Bros., they'll wait a bit after appearing before wandering off on their own. They can be picked up and thrown at foes for minimal damage. Their shield-breaking properties are high.\"Other  When Lucas is arriving in a battle in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, he rides onto the field on the Mr. Saturn's walking coffee table. Ness also has an alternate costume featuring a white Mr. Saturn sprite on a solid black t-shirt. It's very similar to the Good Kid's Shirt, an equippable item that is found in Saturn Valley in Mother 3.Trivia Ultimate Chimera  The Ultimate Chimera is an enemy in Mother 3. It is a battery-powered Chimera which takes on a hideous appearance due to being created from the DNA of numerous different species, making it one of the very few chimeras that were created from more than two such species; however, the specific animals used to create it are never revealed. It is first encountered in the Chimera Laboratory.Description  The Ultimate Chimera is a red beast with tiny, indigo, bat-like wings, a pointed tail, horns (or pointed, cat-like ears), and slightly reptilian characteristics. Its most notable feature is its gigantic mouth, which stretches across much of the length of its body and is lined with huge, sharp teeth. It has a tiny bird on its back whose function is apparently to reactivate it.Appearances  The Ultimate Chimera was created by Dr. Andonuts in the Chimera Laboratory to be the ultimate killing machine, but it went rogue before he could destroy its last weakness, an off-button on its back.First Encounter  After Lucas and friends defeat the rogue Almost-Mecha Lion with the help of a Clayman, the laboratory is thrust into red alert: scientists have been overwhelmed by the Ultimate Chimera, which was among the chimeras that Salsa and Samba released, and is now free to roam the corridors unbound. It can appear in any room of the laboratory, and can also use the elevator. If it catches the party, they will be automatically defeated, evidently ranking it as one of the most threatening creatures in Mother 3, and the strongest 'enemy' in the game. Despite this, its movements are relatively simplistic; if it notices Lucas and co., it will move in a straight line towards them to the point where it will continue to bump into an obstacle between the two parties rather than go around it. At one point, the Chimera corners Lucas and his dog, Boney. Dr. Andonuts, hiding in a garbage can, tells Lucas to offer Boney as bait so he can press the power button, but Lucas refuses. Just as it dives at Lucas, Salsa, who remembered how Lucas saved him in the Sunshine Forest with the aid of the Dragos, jumps onto it and presses the button himself, deactivating the monster. After the Chimera is deactivated, Boney gets angry at Dr. Andonuts, who claims the bait suggestion was just a joke, and runs off with a barking Boney in pursuit. However, after all the other characters leave the hallway, the bird on its head simply pushes the button to revive it after everyone had left.Second Encounter  It is encountered again in the Restroom Level of the Empire Porky Building in New Pork City, where it is guarding the Awesome Ring. To get the ring, Lucas has to enter the bathroom stall housing the monster, then quickly leave before it bites. If Lucas and co. then wait in the stall connecting to the next room, the Chimera will then bust down the door to its stall and walk around the room, giving the party an opportunity to run in and grab the Awesome Ring without being caught. In theory, it IS possible to run around the Ultimate Chimera and open the present before being caught, but this results in being defeated immediately after grabbing the ring, and generally requires heavy abuse of emulation save states to accomplish.Super Smash Bros. Brawl  The Ultimate Chimera appears in Super Smash Bros. Brawl on the New Pork City stage, where it appears and disappears at random times. Like in Mother 3, it wanders aimlessly and attacks the player when they are too close; however, if it spawns on a platform that a character is already on, it will not attack them until they leave the platform. Its bite deals 100% to 200% damage and massive knockback; the attack is designed to be an \"instant kill\" as it is in the Mother series, although the unfortunate character may survive if they bounce off enough walls, or ukemi them. If the Ultimate Chimera is on the destructable platform at the bottom of the stage, the player has the opportunity to temporarily \"defeat\" it by smashing the platform with the Ultimate Chimera on it. It then will roar loudly as it plummets out of sight, though it will eventually respawn.Duster  Duster (\u30c0\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc Dasut\u0101) is a character in Mother 3.\u00a0A thief who sets out on adventures of his own\u00a0first introduced in Chapter 1, he later becomes a main character in Chapter 2. Duster joins Lucas at the end of Chapter 4 after being in the DCMC for three years as their bassist (where he was called Lucky); it is also shown that he learned to play the double bass cello after being picked up by DCMC after the event in Chapter 3 when Duster \"goes missing\" from Kumatora and Wess for three years. He is separated at the end of Chapter 5, and returns permanently during Chapter 7, though in the final battle he is somewhat useless due to the fact that the Masked Man uses a move that K.O.s the entire team except for Lucas. He usually uses shoes as his primary weapon, along with a number of Thief Tools that weaken or distract foes. While having a leg that he is always seen to limp with, Duster continues to have excellent speed. Not only is he the second-fastest party member after Boney, but he can sometimes \"Attack with blinding speed!\" to attack the enemy before the start of the battle or jump behind an enemy, which flips the entire party behind the enemy and gives the party a turn to attack before the enemy can. He can also unleash a reverse kick on an enemy that has attacked the party from behind before the enemy takes their turn.\u00a0Wess alludes to an incident in his past in which he blames himself for paralyzing Duster's left leg. The limp is recognizable regardless of what he is wearing, such as when he is in the guise of a Pigmask. However, he has no difficulty running, kicking, and moving on staircases, so his leg might not be completely immobile. Due to the way he holds his hip to give his leg extra support, he may just be paralyzed from the ankle down, which would make it awkward for Duster to walk but not reduce the effectiveness of kicking with the leg in mention with a good shoe on.In Super Smash Bros. Super Smash Bros. Brawl  Duster appears in Super Smash Bros. Brawl as a sticker. Attaching this sticker to the bottom of Ness or Lucas's trophies in The Subspace Emissary increases the power of their leg-based attacks by four.Super Smash Bros. Ultimate  Duster appears as a primary spirit in the new Spirits mode. He is an attack type, novice spirit with one support slot.Trivia Starmen  The Starmen are a race of beings in EarthBound Beginnings and EarthBound. They are extraterrestrial beings, and are among the original users of PSI. Starmen are common among the higher ranks of Giygas's army.Appearances EarthBound Beginnings  George, one of two humans abducted from Earth by an alien race in 1909, studies PSI without the race's permission, and later escapes back to Earth. Once matured, the alien Giygas is tasked by his people to ensure PSI never spreads onto Earth, and commands a number of sentient beings, including the Starmen, to carry out this order.EarthBound  Ninten and his friends triumph over Giygas' defeat, and he and the Starmen recede back into space, only to come back and enslave the world sometime in the future, draping it in \"infinite darkness\". One alien survivor, Buzz Buzz, rides ten years into the past on a meteorite, in order to contact another chosen boy, Ness. However, a Starman Junior is revealed to have followed Buzz Buzz back to Ness' time, and a battle ensues, after which the Starman falls. The Starman and Starman Super can be found all over the Stonehenge Base, along with Atomic Power Robots and their apparent head, the Starman Deluxe. Other variants, including the Ghost of Starman and Final Starman, appear in Onett and the Cave of the Past. While they do not appear in Mother 3, the Pigmask Army plays a similar role as a group of enemies aiding the game's antagonist.Species  It is unknown if Starmen are organic or synthetic, or if their outward appearance is just a suit; the American EarthBound player's guide implies in their enemy descriptions that Starmen are robots. Their speech in EarthBound also reflects this; in Mother 2, Starmen use the katakana script, which is a common way to denote robotic-sounding speech. The English version, lacking this, gives them \"whirrs\", \"beeps\" and \"clicks\", to indicate they are robotic beings. However, they may be organic, as the Rust Promoter, which is supposed to damage mechanical enemies, is useless against Starmen of any kind. Same goes for PK Beam \u03b3 in EarthBound Beginnings, as it doesn't affect mechanical enemies, yet can damage any Starman, save for the Starman Junior. Also, an enemy called \"Ghost of Starman\" is encountered towards the end of EarthBound, but if the Starmen are robots, they wouldn't be able to become a ghost. The description of the Ghost of Starman in the EarthBound player's guide refers to it as an alien. They may also be connected via a sort of \"hivemind\"; when the Starman Deluxe is defeated, any Starmen summoned during the battle are defeated as well, and the Stonehenge Base becomes devoid of enemies. Starmens' arms and legs do not seem to move, so Starmen instead appear to move around by means of teleportation (though this type is different from PSI Teleport). This can be seen when Ness approaches a Starman in EarthBound, as they will then teleport directly behind him and occasionally trigger a surprise attack in their favor. It can also be seen in Super Smash Bros., where, once activated, the Starman assist trophy teleports randomly around the arena while firing electric bolts. The members of the Starmen 'species' are listed as follows: According to the official EarthBound Player's Guide, Atomic Power Robots are early prototypes to the Starman series.Battle Music In Super Smash Bros. Brawl  The Starmen species are represented by the Starman enemy, who appears in Super Smash Bros. Brawl as a sticker. Attaching this sticker to the bottom of Ness or Lucas's trophies in The Subspace Emissary increases their PK attack by 10.In Super Smash Bros. Wii U and 3DS  In the mode, Smash Run, in Super Smash Bros. for 3DS, Starmen occasionally appear as enemies. They primarily stand in their signature pose and shoot small beams at players that temporarily stun them. They also teleport around the opponent to avoid being attacked. Though when hit by a strong move, they appear to fall over, staying in their pose. If unattacked while knocked down, they will eventually hop back up and continue attacking players. Starmen also appear in both versions, though in the Assist Trophies in standard smash modes. Here they act identically to their Smash Run counterparts, except that they only attack opponents of their summoners.Trivia PSI Rockin  PSI Rockin (PK \u30ad\u30a2\u30a4 PK Kiai, lit. PK Fighting Spirit), sometimes referred to as PK Rockin, is a PSI ability in EarthBound and is Ness's signature move. Ness's Nightmare and Giygas (before Pokey turns off the Devil's Machine) are also capable of using PSI Rockin. It deals damage to all enemies and has the possibility of decreasing one of the targets' Psychic Shield strength by 1. When used in battle, it displays a series of psychedelic lights and sounds, and inflicts high damage on all enemies based on the level of PSI Rockin used. At its Omega (\u03a9) level, its power is rivaled only by PSI Starstorm \u03a9, and (to an extent) PSI Freeze \u03a9. It cannot be used out of battle. Like the four main characters, King, and Ness' favorite food, the player can give a unique name to PSI Rockin before the story begins by entering their \"favorite thing.\"  The Virtual Console re-release of\u00a0EarthBound\u00a0alters the animations of PSI Rockin by significantly blurring them. This is done to reduce the risk of epileptic seizures, a standard precaution in re-releases of older Nintendo games.\u00a0Trivia Fassad  Fassad (also known as \u30e8\u30af\u30d0 Yokuba), previously known as\u00a0Locria before joining the Pigmask Army, is a recurring antagonist in Mother 3. In his life as Locria, one of the seven Magypsies, he once guarded the final needle that needed to be pulled in order to awaken the Dark Dragon. Unknown as to where Locria was, according to Ionia and the other Magypsies, they seem to never hear from Locria or feel his presence. The reason behind this is his betrayal of the Magypsies when he joined the Pigmask Army, where he became one of the top commanders.\u00a0Duties and a Life as a Pigmask Commander  Fassad is first seen in Chapter 1, making a rather small cameo. After Flint is released from jail, the player can go to Butch's farm, and see Fassad making a deal with Butch to buy his pigs from him. He later bumps into Duster in Chapter 2 while on the way to steal the money he gave to Butch as part of their deal. Fassad takes a larger role in Chapter 3, appearing in Death Desert along with Salsa the monkey. He is there under the orders of the Pigmask Army to sell Happy Boxes to the people of Tazmily Village. Fassad constantly tortures Salsa with the shock collar around his neck for failing at his tasks, and even for succeeding at them. After making Salsa hand-deliver Happy Boxes to four people, he goes to Osohe Castle to see what all the commotion is about. Discovering that the Egg of Light was was taken by Duster, Wess and Kumatora, Fassad chases after the party, and commands Salsa to pull a lever that, instead of getting him closer to the party, ends up saving them. He reappears later at Thunder Tower after the Pork Trooper reveals that Lucas isn't really the Masked Man. Fassad, along with some other Pigmasks, chases the party to the top of the tower. After walking about while talking to the party, his habit of carelessly discarding the peels of his Luxury Bananas leads to his downfall, when he slips over a tossed banana peel and tumbles from Thunder Tower's summit. Although it seems that he is dead, this is disproved when the party is about to pull the fourth needle at Fire Mountain, and Fassad and his Interpreter appear. Fassad needs his Interpreter because, after the Pigmask Army resurrected him as a cyborg, he had horns implanted where his mouth was. The party defeats him and he retreats. He returns for the last time in the sewers of New Pork City as Miracle Fassad, with even more horns (including two that function similar to his jetpack as New Fassad). After being defeated, he goes on to say that he is sick of fighting, and that this is all just Porky's game. Shortly afterwards he explodes and he falls into the sewers, never to rise again. His fate may have been the same as the other Magypsies since he was meant to guard the final needle. His Interpreter then tells Lucas and co. not to follow it since it is not needed anymore, and flies away; the Interpreter cannot be found again. Since his memento (the Razor and Lipstick) can be obtained in Locria's Level before the pulling of Locria's Needle, unlike the other Magypsies, it is implied that he vanished after his second defeat, which would make Fassad the only Magypsy to not disappear after the pulling of their Needle.Special Attacks as a Party Member  Fassad has his own arsenal of attacks at his disposal. Although he is not a playable character, he is a powerful party member. Since Salsa is at level 1 in Chapter 3 when he is first playable, his attacks are significantly weaker than those of Fassad, leaving him to effectively pull the party's combined weight. Fassad can use a standard attack, bum rush foes for at least moderate damage, and rarely throw bombs that deal massive damage. If Salsa has any status ailments, he will cure them by activating the Punishizer, which restores Salsa to normal at the cost of 1 HP. On occasion, Fassad will waste his turn by performing various (and often comedic) actions; some of the more cowardly ones are borrowed from Pokey's first appearance in EarthBound. The full list includes:As an Enemy (New/Miracle Fassad)  After his preservation as a mechanical chimera, Fassad battles Lucas and co. on two occasions in the game. In both battles, his abilities are largely the same: he can charge a single party member, attack three at once with an off-key music attack, or throw a whole bunch of bombs at everyone. He can also emit a dazzling light to make everyone cry, and he can even emit an intense light that causes one party member to faint instantly. He can use an awful smell, Forgetfulness Gas, and flea bombs to inflict nausea, forgetfulness, and fleas, respectively. He can defend himself with a Shield device, and he can scarf down a Luxury Banana to heal 500-600 HP (far more than Lucas and co. can heal from the same item). He smiles boldly on occasion. He becomes vulnerable to salt watergun after his makeover, however. As Miracle Fassad, some of his horns will break off after he loses a significant amount of HP, reverting him to his New Fassad sprite. When this happens, his heart fills with hatred, and he reveals his true power: a deadly array of PSI attacks, including PK Freeze \u03a9, PK Thunder \u03a9, Brainshock \u03a9, Offense Down \u03a9, PSI Shield \u03b1 and Defense Up \u03b1. But his most dangerous attack by far is the rare and destructive PK Starstorm. Fassad has two different sets of Battle Sounds for each battle. As New Fassad, he uses Battle Sound 53, which falls under Code Numbers 918 for regular attack, 919 for Smaaaash! and 920 for Miss. As Miracle Fassad, he uses Battle Sound 31, which falls under Code Numbers 852 for regular attack, 853 for Smaaaash! and 854 for Miss.Secret identity as the lost Magypsy, Locria  Although it is never explicitly stated, the game contains substantial evidence proving beyond reasonable doubt that Fassad is the lost Magypsy, Locria. The earliest example is in Fire Mountain, where the newly rebuilt cyborg ambushes Lucas and friends; the trumpets that sound in place of his own voice play a distorted version of the background music heard in the Magypsies' homes. Later, when he is fought in the New Pork City sewers as the even further redesigned \"Miracle Fassad\", he uses PSI abilities (including the elusive PK Starstorm) which, in the age of Mother 3, are generally limited to use by Magypsies and their disciples. When Lucas and his party reach Leder in New Pork City, he states that Locria had betrayed the Magypsies and joined the Pigmask Army. Fassad would fit under this description, as he does affiliate with them and is of high authority to the army. The biggest cache of evidence is found in Locria's house, which is on one of the highest floors of the Empire Porky Building in New Pork City. The house contains a turban and vest worn by Fassad, numerous crates of Luxury Bananas, and a pair of New Fassad's horns. On the same floor is a lone mouse counting on Locria to return to the house, as it was apparently taken care of by Locria. The mouse also reinforces Fassad's identity as a Magypsy by attesting that Locria had a distinct \"Nwehehehehe\" laugh and that he was hardly seen as a good person by most. Fassad's status as a Magypsy was eventually confirmed by Shigesato Itoi.Trivia Ness's Nightmare  Ness' Nightmare is a boss in EarthBound. It is encountered during Ness' venture in the Sea of Eden within Magicant, and is the manifestation of the evil in Ness' mind. As such, when Ness' Nightmare is defeated, Ness destroys all of the evil, fears, and doubts that were within him, allowing him to absorb the true power of the eight \"Your\" Sanctuary locations. The field sprite for Ness' Nightmare is identical to that of Evil Mani-Mani, though the relationship between the two, if any, is uncertain. It is possible that Ness' mind chose the Mani-Mani Statue as a known symbol of evil. It is also possible that the trait of the Mani-Mani Statue bringing out the evil in people may have influenced Ness' inner turmoils to conjoin into the form of the Mani-Mani Statue.  During the battle, as the manifestation of Ness' evil (essentially a part of Ness), the Nightmare's attacks are all the same PSI attacks Ness can use; this includes various levels of PSI Rockin, PSI Flash (via a glorious light), PSI Lifeup, and Shield \u03b2.Trivia ", "Earthbound Wiki": "Earthbound Wiki Giygas  Giygas, also known as Giegue (Japanese: \u30ae\u30fc\u30b0 Gyiyg), is the main antagonist in EarthBound Beginnings and EarthBound. Known as both the \"Embodiment of Evil\" and the \"Universal Cosmic Destroyer\", Giygas is an evil alien who, upon failing his original mission to reclaim the knowledge of PSI from humans, intends to sentence all of reality to the horror of infinite darkness. With an army of Starmen, Octobots and other deadly war machines, Giygas also uses his immense power to influence certain Earthlings to assist him, such as Pokey Minch and Geldegarde Monotoli. His influence also causes animals and people to become violent and distressed. He belongs to a race of aliens who originally had the power of PSI and, for unknown reasons, abducted humans in the 1900s and 198X. In EarthBound, most of Giygas's operations take place in the city of Fourside.In EarthBound Beginnings  Eighty years later, the invasion begins, and Giygas is confronted by the great-grandson of Maria and George, Ninten, and his companions. Giygas's influence is seen across the land as inanimate objects come to life, animals turn vicious and strange aliens begin to inhabit the earth. During the final confrontation, Giygas, still hurt by the loss of Maria, offers Ninten to come with him back to his home planet. Ninten declines this offer, and Giygas continues to attack. Ninten and his friends quickly prove no match for Giygas; they resort to singing a lullaby once shared between Maria and Giygas, and the comforting memories he had suppressed weaken Giygas. His guilt and love for Maria distress him and he is forced to surrender and retreat, but not before promising Ninten that he will return.In EarthBound  Giygas returns to Earth many years later in 199X as the primary antagonist of EarthBound, though he vastly differs from his appearance in EarthBound Beginnings. Ten years in the future, Giygas has taken over the Earth and sent all in it to darkness. He discovers the Apple of Enlightenment which prophecizes his defeat at the hands of Ness and so travels back into the past in order to stop Ness. In the present day, his influence is spreading over Eagleland, in particular to Ness's neighbor Pokey Minch. Pokey becomes one of Giygas's main agents in the attack against Ness, aided by his jealousy of Ness. Giygas, already unstable from his guilt surrounding the loss of Maria, exerts such tremendous evil power that it destroys his entire being, including his mind, causing him to become undefinable by human standards. As such, Giygas manifests as what can only be described as pure evil; in Pokey Minch's words, \"he is the Evil Power\". Due to the loss of his mind, Giygas becomes irrational and incapable of thought. To rectify this, Pokey seals him in the Devil's Machine so that his power would be contained and his mind kept intact. In the final battle, Pokey attests that Giygas isn't aware of himself or what he is doing, referring to him as \"an all-mighty idiot\". Now wielding a vast cosmic power which he is unable to control, Giygas becomes a threat to the existence of the universe itself. To stop him, one of the only known beings who manage to escape destruction in the future, an alien insect named Buzz Buzz, travels back to 199X. Buzz Buzz warns Ness of the impending catastrophe. Ness is given the Sound Stone and instructed to record the Eight Melodies in order to gain the power of Earth and be strong enough to face Giygas. Giygas's influence is further seen throughout the world, mainly in the form of enemies that Ness encounters. Now existing as the whole of evil power in the universe, Giygas is able to manipulate the evil in the minds of living beings, both human and animal, and can apparently manipulate even the forms of inanimate objects. Ness and his friends, known in prophecy as the Chosen Four, are forced to abandon their bodies and travel into the past in order to attack Giygas in The Cave of the Past. In the final battle, Giygas is held within the Devil's Machine, which was created to contain Giygas's tremendous power. During the battle, Pokey shuts the machine off, causing all of Giygas's power to be unleashed; the event surrounds the four children in a chaotic, bizarre dimension of darkness. His attacks are random and incomprehensible, and his speech is erratic and mindless. Although Giygas was too powerful for Ness and his friends to overcome by fighting, he is eventually defeated after Paula calls out to the people of Earth to Pray (including the player), and the combined prayers reach Giygas and exploit his weakness, the same human emotion that weakened him in EarthBound Beginnings. He breaks up and is reduced to nothingness, and his apocalyptic future is erased. The five phases of the battle are:Conception  In an interview about Giygas's appearance in EarthBound, Shigesato Itoi revealed that while Giygas is mostly something that can not be made sense of, a part of it is \"like a living being that deserves love. That part is the breast of Hisako Tsukuba from \u201cThe Military Policeman and the Dismembered Beauty\u201d. \"The Military Policeman and the Dismembered Beauty\" (\u61b2\u5175\u3068\u30d0\u30e9\u30d0\u30e9\u6b7b\u7f8e\u4eba \"Kenpei to Barabara Shibijin\") is a 1957 adult film that Shigesato Itoi accidentally saw as a child when he walked into the wrong theater, confusing a lovemaking scene that becomes a murder as rape. In fact, Itoi is incorrect about several details from the scene: he says that \"When the guy grabbed her breast really hard, it got distorted into this ball shape. It all hit me really hard. It was a direct attack to my brain.\" despite the fact that this does not actually occur, and Itoi admitted that his memories of that scene were \"fuzzy at best\". However, from his memories of the scene, he added \"this sense of terror having atrocity and eroticism side-by-side, and that\u2019s what Giygas's lines at the end are. During the end, he says, \u201cIt hurts,\u201d right? That's... her breast. It\u2019s like, how do I put it, a \u201cliving-being\u201d sensation.\" Giygas's dialogue was created by both himself and a staff member Matchan Miura. Since Itoi did not know how to use computers at this time, the two of them would sit alone in a room with Itoi speaking the dialogue one Japanese letter at a time and Matchan typing in on the computer and it being displayed in hiragana. Itoi would then look at the screen and give Miura instructions on what to change, and a section would be finished once Itoi was impressed and they both were almost in tears.Theories  For many years, fans have debated and created multiple theories concerning Giygas. Two theories have achieved widespread acknowledgment and have been of popular debate. The following are three theories.Trivia Main Page Pokey Minch  Porky Minch(\u30dd\u30fc\u30ad\u30fc\u30fb\u30df\u30f3\u30c1), also known as Pokey Minch in EarthBound, is the secondary antagonist of EarthBound and the main antagonist of Mother 3, but also appears non-canonically in Super Smash Bros. Brawl. A portly and distasteful boy, he is Ness's neighbor in the suburbs of Onett, the son of Aloysius Minch and Lardna Minch, and the older brother of Picky Minch. Porky's family acts bitter towards Ness's, because his father, Aloysius Minch, loaned a few hundred thousand dollars to Ness's father (though Aloysius admits it could have been a lot less), and was never repaid. Porky and his father later on found work in Fourside as consultants for the city's mayor. Porky's battle music in EarthBound is known to fans as \"Cease to Exist\" in Japan, and \"Pokey Means Business\" elsewhere, but no official name for the track exists. His themes in Mother 3 are \"Master Porky's Theme\" and \"Absolutely Safe Capsule\", and are played during the initial confrontations with him and following his retreat into the Absolutely Safe Capsule, respectively.Biography In EarthBound  At the beginning of EarthBound, Porky lives with his parents, Aloysius and Lardna, and his younger brother Picky in the house next door to Ness's. He likes to play practical jokes, and Shigesato Itoi has stated that he does not have any friends and therefore likely played only with Ness most of the time. When a Meteorite lands north of their houses in Onett, Porky and Picky sneak out of their house to investigate. When Picky turns up missing, Porky turns to Ness, pleading him to help him find his younger brother, afraid to go alone. After sweet-talking Ness's mother and convincing Ness to help him, they head off to look for Picky. At the meteorite landing site, Ness, Porky, and Picky meet Buzz Buzz, an alien from ten years in the future. Porky learns of the impending destruction of the universe at the hands of Giygas, but convinces himself that he is not one of the heroes that the alien speaks of. On the way back home, they are confronted by one of Giygas's underlings, Starman Junior. Porky cowers in fear while Ness and Picky assist Buzz Buzz in defeating the alien. After Ness escorts Porky and Picky safely home, Porky isn't seen again for some time. Porky first resurfaces as a high priest of the Happy Happyist cult, led by Carpainter. Porky kidnaps Paula with the intention of performing a human sacrifice. After Ness rescues Paula, Porky appears and orders two of the cult's followers and a Spiteful Crow to attack them. After the cult is disbanded, he tries to befriend Ness again, only to run off, revealing that he was lying (in the Japanese version, Ness's \"silent protagonist\" status mistakenly gives the impression of harsh shunning, thus causing an insulted Porky to sever all ties with Ness and abandon him). Porky and his father are later seen working as business consultants for Fourside's mayor Geldegarde Monotoli. He uses the money to live a luxurious life, but he eventually steals Monotoli's helicopter after Monotoli is confronted by Ness. Following this, Porky is not seen again onscreen until the end of the game, although his tracks can still be followed throughout the journey; his helicopter is shown to have crashed in the Deep Darkness, for instance. Nevertheless, Porky still causes trouble for Ness behind the scenes: it is revealed that Porky stole the first Phase Distorter in order to escape to The Cave of the Past, and has apparently played a part in strengthening Giygas's power. Porky finally reappears as Giygas's right-hand subordinate within the Cave of the Past, his skin pale and discolored, piloting an organic, spider-like machine. At this point, Porky reveals to Ness his true allegiance, taunting Ness and his companions before attacking them alongside Giygas. Once Giygas is destroyed, Porky uses time travel to escape into another era, but not before taunting Ness one last time. His final lines of dialogue in the game come through Picky in a suspicious hate letter that says, \"Come and get me, loser! Spankety spankety spankety!\"In Mother 3  Throughout most of Mother 3, Porky's presence is never explicitly mentioned, though it is implied. In the fan translation, he switches over to his Japanese name, \"Porky\", to better fit in with the pig theme of his affiliations, as well as to match the numerous graphical assets in the game boldly displaying his name in English text. As early as Chapter 4, there are references to \"King P\", such as a mention in the DCMC song title. Throughout the game, there are also references to \"Pork\" in different scenarios, such as \"Pork Troopers\" or \"Bag of Pork Chips\". In the Thunder Tower in Chapter 5, Porky's playroom is visited, with numerous references to EarthBound in it, though it is merely talked about as \"the King's playroom\". There is also a sold out sign in the Chimera Laboratory for a creature called PORKY 08. Finally, at the end of Chapter 7, it is clearly stated that the King is indeed Porky, and Lucas and his friends are brought to his city of New Pork City. Here, Porky's presence is emphasized, with many statues and dolls of him appearing, as well as a theater that shows pictures from EarthBound. The aforementioned playroom and Leder's speech, as well as the appearance of the Porky idols, imply that Porky is somehow still a child in the time. Throughout the Empire Porky Building, Porky taunts Lucas and co. through his intercom. When the top of the tower is finally reached, Porky himself appears, looking only slightly older than his EarthBound self. He then asks the player if they want to befriend him, but once they answer, he explodes, revealing himself to only be a robot version of Porky. Several other Mecha-Porkies join, battling Lucas all at once. When this is over, the actual Porky arrives in a new, fully-inorganic machine. However, his appearance has changed significantly; he has become extremely old and frail, coughing in nearly every sentence, as a result of his misuse of time travel. He explains how his servant is about to pull the final needle, and that there is nothing Lucas company can do about it. After that, he leaves in a shortcut to the location. Porky soon confronts them in a large spider mecha near the final battle location. Throughout the battle, he reveals that he has learned PSI, being able to perform inexplicable attacks much like Giygas could. During the battle, he explains that due to time travel, he has become immortal, as well as unkillable, stressing that when the Dark Dragon is awakened, only he and the Dragon will be the only ones left so that everyone who does not like him will be gone, and that he is prepared for such a fate. When he sees he is to be defeated, he calls upon the Absolutely Safe Capsule and climbs inside. It seals Porky inside, and being true to its name, it protects Porky from all harm. However, Porky finds that he cannot harm the heroes, either. When the battle ends, Dr. Andonuts reveals that he built the Absolutely Safe Capsule with the specifications that once someone is inside, the machine cannot be opened by anyone, including the person inside of it. So while Pokey is indeed \"absolutely safe\", he is trapped in the machine forever, doomed to spend eternity in isolation. Andonuts even feels sympathy for the tyrant, as in his own words, \". . . All he can do now is spend eternity inside the capsule, in absolute safety.\" Shigesato Itoi has confirmed this by stating that because of this, Porky will still be alive 5.5 billion years from now . At the end of the game, when the player is traveling in the darkness, they come into contact with an object that rolls with glee. While they may not be able to tell what it is, it is most likely Porky having survived the destruction of the land, as the Pigmask theme plays when you touch it. It is possible that he actually felt better after the events that took place.Personality  Porky Minch is shown to be very immature and childish, even when his body ages beyond his own measure. He can often be obnoxious, and is also shown to be very selfish and egotistical, which Shigesato Itoi says is likely due to how terrible and abusive his parents were. Porky does not appear to be self-conscious about his weight, or his resemblance to a pig (as King P, the naming of virtually every facet of his empire refers to pigs, such as the Pigmask Army, and New Pork City). Though he is naturally mischievous, after Porky is corrupted by Giygas, his childish sense of humor becomes increasingly malicious. He actively abets the destruction of the universe in EarthBound, and in Mother 3 his antics nearly wipe out the Nowhere Islands, ruining and even ending the lives of an untold number of the island's inhabitants, particularly Hinawa and Claus. Porky's actions were more than likely due to wanting friendship, according to Shigesato Itoi, and that Porky himself is like a poem.In Super Smash Bros. Brawl  Porky Minch also appears in the adventure mode of Super Smash Bros. Brawl, The Subspace Emissary, as a boss. Here, he is seen as a high-ranked member of the Subspace Army who attacks Lucas in The Ruined Zoo using his Pig King Statue and a fleet of Primids. Before the Statue can kill Lucas, Porky's \"best friend\"\u00a0Ness appears and destroys the Statue with PK Flash. From the exploding Statue emerges Porky in his Mother 3 spider mech, but he is quickly defeated by Ness and Lucas in a boss battle. Once Porky is defeated, Ness and Lucas celebrate, but not for very long, as Wario soon arrives to turn Ness back into a trophy. Porky Minch also appears as a sticker. Attaching this sticker to the bottom of Ness or Lucas's trophies in The Subspace Emissary increases their PK attack by 15. In this appearance he is referred to \"Porky\", a more proper translation of his name, even on the label for his sticker, which uses his EarthBound clay model for the image. It was most likely changed for this game because of his pig-themed empire in Mother 3, as well as all the signs saying \"PORKY\" in New Pork City, akin to the reasoning for his naming choice in the Mother 3 fan translation.Trivia  Obviously, Porky does not assist Ness in battles.List of Quotes EarthBound Mother 3 References Ness  Ness (\u30cd\u30b9, Ness) is the silent main protagonist of EarthBound and is analogous to Ninten and Lucas in their respective games. He greatly enjoys baseball; not only are most of his weapons various types of baseball bats, but he can also equip several baseball caps. In the EarthBound Player's Guide, he is said to wear a special baseball cap with his favorite team's logo on the front. He has a pet dog named King, a younger sister named Tracy, and two parents.Appearance  Ness has a strange resemblence to Ninten; he wears the exact same cap, shirt, and pants. The only differences are that the blue flap on his cap is on the right side instead of the left side, he wears white socks instead of red, and wears red-white shoes. He also wears a brown-white backpack. He has black eyes like Ninten, but unlike him, he just has circle eyes, that are purple-blueish, as seen in Super Smash Bros. Brawl.Biography  At the beginning of EarthBound, Ness is awoken from a sound sleep by the impact of a meteorite north of his house in Onett. His mother and sister are agitated, but Ness leaves to find out what happened. After meeting up with Lier X. Agerate and his next-door neighbor, Pokey Minch, he returns home and tries to get back to sleep. Soon thereafter, Pokey arrives and demands that Ness help him look for his little brother, who has gone missing during the calamity surrounding the impact. After a pep-talk from his mother, Ness, Pokey, and King go back out to the hillside, where they find Picky (who reveals it was Pokey who actually ran away). They also encounter Buzz-Buzz, an insectoid warrior who has returned from the future to warn Ness of the threat that Giygas poses to the universe. It is from Buzz-Buzz that Ness learns of the prophecy surrounding his future; that he, along with the help of two other boys and one girl, will stand against Giygas and save the universe from total annihilation. Vested with this knowledge, Ness accompanies Pokey and Picky back to their home but is assaulted by a Starman Jr. The alien confirms the prophecy before attacking the group. It is defeated through Buzz-buzz's massive PSI powers and Ness' physical attacks. Upon arriving at Pokey's house, Buzz-buzz is unceremoniously killed (for his alleged resemblance to a dung beetle) by Lardna Minch. Before expiring, Buzz-buzz passes on the Sound Stone to Ness and starts him on his quest to save the world. In the town of Onett, Ness first unlocks the power of Giant Step after tangling with Frank Fly and the Sharks. However, Captain Strong and the Onett Police Force are not happy with Ness investigating private property and ambush him at the police station. They back off and give him way to Twoson after he bests them in a fight.\u00a0 In Twoson, Ness is telepathically contacted by Paula, another member of his party, who asks him to come and rescue her. Learning her whereabouts from Everdred, a friendly gangster, Ness finds his way through\u00a0Peaceful Rest Valley to Happy Happy Village, which is under the spell of the Happy Happyist Cult. He finds Paula locked in a cell in a hidden house. She gives Ness the Franklin Badge so that he can withstand the lightning attacks of\u00a0Mr. Carpainter, the Happy Happyist leader. Ness confronts Carpainter and defeats him, thereby breaking the spell of Happy Happyism over the valley. Though he blames a certain statue, Carpainter thanks, Ness and gives him the key to Paula's cell. Ness frees Paula but encounters Pokey outside. Pokey reveals that he was the high priest behind the Happy Happyist threat and escapes, vowing to return. Ness and Paula gain the power of Lilliput Steps from the nearby cave.\u00a0 They then find way to Threed after assisting the Runaway Five, a famous jazz band, in escaping a debt at the Twoson theater. The Runaway Five take them there in their van and drop them off. Ness and Paula quickly discover the town is under an awful curse and zombies run rampant. They try to fight the zombies but are lured into a trap and locked in an underground cell. Paula contacts Jeff telepathically. He arrives in a flying capsule and unlocks the cell door with a special invention. The three of them conspire with the townsfolk to trap the zombies in the circus tent with flypaper. They then find a secret exit in the back of the graveyard and venture forth to find the source of the zombie scourge.\u00a0 Following the cave, they come upon Saturn Valley, which is under the threat of Master Belch, who not only has dominion of the zombies, but has kidnapped many innocent residents of the valley. They infiltrate a secret base behind a waterfall near the valley and encounter Belch. Playing on his obsession with fly honey, they easily defeat him and free the Saturn Valley inhabitants, gaining the power of Milky Well in the process.\u00a0 Their mission in Saturn Valley completed, they go back to Threed, which is now back to normal, and take the bus to Fourside. Unfortunately, they run into bad traffic in the desert and are forced to abandon the bus and conclude the journey on foot. Arriving in Fourside, they find the Runaway Five has fallen into debt with the city theater yet again. Ness and the gang assist in digging for treasure in a mine in the desert and repay the theater proprietor on behalf of the band. Later on, while shopping in the Fourside Department Store, there is a sudden power failure and Paula is snatched away in the dark. Hearing a call on the intercom, Ness and Jeff go to an office on the top floor where they fight and defeat the Department Store Spook. Looking for clues to Paula's disappearance at Jackie's Cafe, Ness and Jeff unexpectedly stumble upon a fantastical alternate dimension called Moonside. Navigating the oppositely-oriented domain, they discover the Mani Mani statue to be the cause and destroy it, to find that they have been in the storeroom to Jackie's Cafe all along. At the advisement of the Apple Kid, they visit a mysterious man who lives among monkeys in the desert named Talah Rama. He gives them a vital trout yogurt machine. Ness and Jeff use the yogurt dispenser to bribe a maid to let them into the Monotoli Building in Fourside, where Paula is apparently being held. With some unexpected help from the Runaway Five, Ness and Jeff make it to Mayor Monotoli's room where they rescue Paula. Monotli apologizes to them for kidnapping Paula but offers them use of his helicopter to travel to Summers. Unfortunately, Pokey who has been working as a consultant for Monotoli and orchestrated Paula's kidnapping steals the helicopter and flies away, taunting and sneering at Ness. \u00a0 The Runaway Five take them back to Threed where they repair Jeff's flying machine and fly to Winters, leaving Eagleland to rendezvous with his father. While Dr. Andonuts remodels the Sky Runner, they find their way to Rainy Circle with the help of the dungeon architect,\u00a0Brick Road. Afterward, they fly to Summers in the Sky Runner. While in Summers, they visit Club Stoic and Ness chats with a woman who shows him some magic cake. After taking a bite, he falls into a slumber and sees a vision of a foreigner from Dalaam named Poo, the fourth and final member of his party. After passing the final test in his training, Ness regains consciousness and Poo teleports to the group. Poo suggests they visit the Summers Cultural Museum, where they find a hidden exhibit that gives an odd clue about the Sphinx in Scaraba. As they are leaving they get a call from Mr. Spoon at the Fourside Dinosaur Museum meant for the museum proprietor. At the Dinosaur Museum they find a pothole in the back, leading through the sewers of Fourside to Magnet Hill, in the middle of the city. Here Ness picks up a Carrot Key, which he uses to find Pink Cloud in Dalaam. They return to Summers and find passage to Scaraba. By activating a set of buttons in front of the Sphinx, Ness and company journey into a pyramid to find the Hawk Eye. With some help from Dungeon Man, they find passage through a dark mire into the Deep Darkness. After the group combats the enemies in the gloomy swamp, including Master Barf, they find Tenda Village and its overly shy residents. Ness then receives a harried phone call from the Apple Kid in Dr. Andonuts' lab, but the line is cut off unexpectedly. The group investigates the deserted lab in Winters and finds clues that point to Giygas' Stonehenge Base nearby. Navigating the base, Ness discovers Dr. Andonuts, Apple Kid, and several residents of Winters held captive in the deepest realms. Ness and the gang defeat a Starman DX for their freedom. The Apple Kid points Ness in the direction of the Onett Library, where he returned a book called \"Overcoming Shyness\". Ness retrieves the book and lends it to the Tendas, who soon become socially adept enough to direct Ness to Lumine Hall. Lumine Hall deposits them all in the dinosaur-infested Lost Underworld where they find the final Sanctuary location, Fire Spring. Ness loses consciousness after hearing the melody and wakes up in Magicant, the colorful, dreamy world of his mind. Ness encounters everyone he has met in his journey here. They direct him to the Sea of Eden, his central conscience, where he confronts his nightmare, the last force of evil in his heart. By eliminating any means that Giygas has of controlling him, Ness gains incredible power with the help of the Sound Stone. The last thing he hears is his own voice telling him to head to Saturn Valley. When Ness wakes up, he and his friends teleport to Saturn Valley to meet up with Dr. Andonuts. With the help of the Apple Kid, he has developed the Phase Distorter II after Pokey stole the original. It needs only one meteorite sample to function properly. Ness travels back to Onett, which is swarming with fierce enemies, for a piece of the meteorite. Ness and company make it back with the meteorite and travel in the Phase Distorter II to the determined location of Giygas's Lair. Ness and the others wind up in the Cave of the Past, but apart from the ruined Phase Distorter, find nothing. Dr. Andonuts and the Apple Kid arrive in the Phase Distorter III with news that Pokey has fled to the past. In order to pursue Pokey, the four of them must have their bodies and souls transferred to robotic bodies since organic matter cannot survive time travel. Even though there may be no going back to his body, Ness and his friends unhesitantly agree to the procedure and Dr. Andonuts sets to work. Now as robots, the four of them travel back in time and find Giygas's Lair with a deformed Pokey at his side. They learn that Giygas's power became too great for even his own mind to handle, Giygas now exists as a nearly omnipotent entity without thought or reason; an \"all-mighty idiot.\" After dealing with Pokey, they attempt to battle Giygas, but their attacks don't seem to be effective. As Giygas attacks them in ways they cannot comprehend, Paula prays with all her heart that someone lends them strength. As she does so, their acquaintances and friends from their journey return with prayers of their own and successfully help to vanquish Giygas. With one more useless insult, Pokey retreats to another time period. With the war against Giygas over, Ness' spirit, along with the others, leave their battered robot bodies and return to the present. Poo returns home, Jeff joins his father, and Ness walks Paula home at her request.In the Super Smash Bros. Series  Ness is a playable character in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, like all other installments so far. Ness's clay model also appears as a sticker in Super Smash Bros. Brawl based on his EarthBound clay model. Attaching this sticker to the bottom of Ness or Lucas's trophies in The Subspace Emissary increases their PK attack by 33. He is voiced by Makiko \u014cmoto.Relationships with other Party Members Paula  After being saved by Ness from cultists, the two become great friends. During the closing of EarthBound, Ness is asked to accompany Paula to her home, and her parents comment on a relationship between the two. Additionally, Ness's mother would ask about her addressing her as his girlfriend.Jeff Andonuts  Despite being accompanied by Jeff for the majority of the game and fighting alongside him, the two rarely interact. The two are known friends as stated by their first interaction.Poo  Poo is the last companion to join Ness on his journey. Slightly aloof due to his training, Poo is nevertheless a friend and stalwart companion.Trivia Mother 3  Mother 3 (Japanese: \u30de\u30b6\u30fc\u30b9\u30ea\u30fc Mother 3) is the third and final installment in the\u00a0Mother series. It was developed by HAL Laboratory, Inc., Nintendo, and Brownie Brown and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance on April 20, 2006. It has currently been released only in Japan. However, there have been multiple fan-made english translations of it. It was designed and directed by Shigesato Itoi, with music by Sh\u014dgo Sakai. Mother 3\u00a0tells the story of Lucas, a young boy, and his friends who journey the Nowhere Islands to save the islands from an invading army and its leader, who have been introducing new technology and infrastructure to the islands. Up until its release, the game remained near the top of Famitsu's most wanted games list. Immediately before its release, Mother 3 was the most wanted game in Japan according to Weekly Famitsu. The title began as a project titled \"EarthBound 64\", a direct sequel to the Mother series' second installment, EarthBound, for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. EarthBound 64 was in development for many years before the project was finally terminated on August 21, 2000, partially because of the Nintendo 64 Disk Drive's commercial failure. Mother 3 was announced in June 2003 during a Mother 1 + 2 television commercial. Although details of its development were kept secret, it has since been made known that EarthBound 64 was reworked into Mother 3. It was released for the Wii U Virtual Console on December 17th 2015, in Japan only. In 2006, EarthBound series creator, Shigesato Itoi, declared that there were no plans for further installments in the Mother series, and because no official English version has been announced, a fan translation was developed and released on October 17, 2008. Throughout the progress made on the project, Tomato and Jeffman were firm in stating that if Nintendo announced an official localization of Mother 3, they would immediately cease their work, indicating that their sole goal was to ensure that the game was translated to English. The president of Brownie Brown, Shinichi Kameoka, has stated that if they were requested to make a port of Mother 3 for worldwide audiences, they would happily do so.Gameplay  Mother 3 starts out very differently from the first two Mother games as is it divided up into eight different chapters, similar to Dragon Quest IV and StarTropics. Instead of focusing on a group of children, it chronicles the story and adventures of Lucas and his family, and the story switches perspective during each chapter. For example, the first half of the game is played as Flint, Duster, and Salsa, but the rest of the game is played as Lucas. The Nowhere Islands also change dramatically because of the influence of the Pigmask Army, transforming from a simple low-tech rural society to a more modern twenty-first century infrastructure that's similar to the first two Mother games (hence the game's theme of nature vs. technology). The game also features a more traditional top-down RPG perspective, instead of the oblique projection used in the first two games. Once again, the game retains the Dragon Quest-style battle system EarthBound Beginnings and EarthBound had (although this time at a much quicker pace), but Mother 3\u00a0adds an extra twist in the form of the music combo system. Depending on how well the player presses the A button in-sync to the lead enemy's \"theme\" (each enemy has their own respective beat, some even possessing variable tempos), he or she can perform up to 16 hits of damaging combos on the game's enemies. The game also has an option of letting the player practice music combos on enemies they have already fought, once they gain a certain item. Tempos can also be more easily heard in the form of a \"heartbeat\" when the enemy is asleep. Enemies are still visible on the field, and can still be approached from behind for a surprise attack (along with the extra added detail of seeing behind an enemy). The game also retains the rolling hit point (abbreviated as HP) and Psychic Points (abbreviated as PP) odometers from the previous game, enabling the player to heal before the counter rolls to zero. In Mother 3, the hit point odometer scrolls more slowly than the previous game and can be slowed further by defending \u2014 however, unlike EarthBound, characters will still collapse if their hit point odometer scrolls to zero. Another new addition is the ability to run, by holding and releasing the B button the player can not only reach areas quicker, but also smash into breakable objects and also stun enemies significantly weaker than the party, replacing the previous game's ability to instantly defeat weak enemies without entering battle. Mother 3 also abandons saving the game by phone in favor of Save Frogs, which are abundant and appear at various areas in the game. Currency, which does not come into play until Chapter 4, comes in the form of Dragon Power (abbreviated as DP), which the player can deposit or transfer from Save Frogs.Plot Characters  Unlike the first two games, the focus is no longer on a group of children. Some chapters put completely different characters in the protagonist role. In one chapter the player controls a limping thief named Duster; in another chapter the main character is Salsa, a monkey who is constantly suffering abuse by a rich traveling merchant named Fassad. The only child character the player gets to control is Lucas, who is about nine to ten years old in the first three chapters and twelve to thirteen years for the remainder of the game. Further controllable characters include Kumatora, a tomboyish princess, Flint, a strange middle-aged cowboy and Lucas's father, and Lucas's dog, Boney.Setting & Premise  Mother 3 is set in the Nowhere Islands, some unknown amount of years after EarthBound. Chaos ensues after an invasion by the Pigmask Army, named after the uniforms, which resemble pigs, and its leader, Porky Minch, the \"Pig King\". They slowly construct a police state, while experimenting on the land's flora and fauna, and introducing new technology and infrastructure to the islands. The various chapters record the life of a boy named Lucas and his family and friends, banding together to rid the Nowhere Islands of the Pigmask Army. True to the game's slogan \"Strange, Funny and Heartrending\", Mother 3 sheds the more lighthearted and quirky plot lines of the previous games in favor of a far darker and more emotional story. The plot involves quite a few tragic and saddening events. However, the game still retains many humorous and bizarre elements that are common to the series.Story  The game opens with a preliminary sequence showing Hinawa visiting her father, Alec, with her twin sons, Claus & Lucas. After her sons play-fight with some Dragos, Hinawa writes a letter to her husband, Flint, stating that she expects to be returning home to Tazmily Village sometime soon. After sending the letter, she hears a strange anthem being played by an unseen flying object, foreshadowing the rest of the story...Chapter 1: Night of the Funeral  The game then switches to Flint's perspective. Late one night, the Sunshine Forest is set on fire by a group of strange people in pig-like masks. Thomas, the fireman of the nearby rural village of Tazmily, rushes to Flint's house and tries to wake him up, breaking the doorknob off the latter's front door in the process. Thomas forces Flint to head into the forest to rescue Lighter and Fuel, who are still trapped in the fire. Flint & Thomas eventually find Lighter, but he had sustained several injuries, apparently from trying to fight the swarm of bugs nearby. The bugs appear to be responsible for the fire, as when Flint confronts them himself, they repeatedly attack by shooting flames from their proboscises. After defeating the swarm, Flint rescues Fuel, who became trapped in his burning house, and was only saved seconds before it collapsed. After reuniting Fuel with Lighter, Tazmily experiences its first rainstorm in \"a while\", putting out the fire; however, the residents of Tazmily realize that Hinawa still hasn't come home, and organize a search party for her. During the search, Flint hears from Isaac that earlier, he thought he saw Hinawa, then heard a Drago's roar, followed by bloodcurdling screams. Issac nervously grows skeptical about this, while Flint later receives the letter Hinawa sent at the end of the prologue. Eventually, Jonel comes across a plateau that appears to have been gashed at by a Drago. This fact worries him, as Dragos are peaceful creatures; even more worrying is the sight of a red scrap of cloth hanging on a tree branch. Seeking to scale the plateau, Flint employs the help of Duster, a skillful adventurer handicapped by a distinctive limp. Using his Wall Staples, Duster forms a ladder to scale the plateau, with Flint taking the lead. Flint then further examines the scrap of cloth on the tree, and finds that the cloth is identical in color to Hinawa's dress. However, his concern is interrupted by the sight of the strange pig-like people who set the forest on fire earlier. The pig-like people react by sending a cybernetic caribou after them. Upon the caribou's defeat, the pig-like people flee, dropping a notebook detailing their plans to \"improve\" the wildlife by taking them apart and fusing them with either cybernetic modifications or parts of other living creatures: a plan dubbed the \"Fascinating Chimera Project\". Flint tucks away the notebook and returns to the village, where Tessie announces that Claus & Lucas were found in the river and are drying by a nearby campfire. However, this period of relief is short-lived, as Bronson suddenly arrives with \"some good news...and...some bad news.\" The good news is that Bronson managed to find a severed Drago Fang, and that it could make a great weapon. The bad news, however, is where he found the fang: \"It was pierced through [Hinawa's] heart.\" Hinawa's murder shocks everyone, but especially devastates Flint, who assaults his peers in a blind rage before being knocked unconscious by Lighter. After dreaming about the last time he saw Hinawa alive (when she left to visit her father on Mt. Oriander), Flint wakes up to find that he is the first prisoner of Tazmily Village's jail. Bronson explains that everyone understands Flint's grief and why he went on a rampage last night, but also admonishes Flint for his poor method of coping with the stress of his wife's murder. Bronson asks Flint to see him once he gets out of jail, as the former managed to fashion the Drago's Fang into an effective weapon. Flint is then visited by Claus, who leaves him an apple with a Hand File tucked into the core. Claus boasts that he'll become strong enough to take on the Drago that killed Hinawa, then leaves without finishing his last sentence. Flint then finds the Hand File in the apple and uses it to break open the rusted lock on the jail cell's door before heading off to Hinawa's wake. There, Alec forces Lucas to reveal that Claus stole Flint's kitchen knife and ran off to the Drago Plateau to avenge Hinawa. Lucas runs away out of shame, as he let Claus go do something that would likely get him killed, and Alec instructs Flint to meet him at his home on Mt. Oriander. Once the two men meet up, they head off to the house of Aeolia, the leader of the six Magypsies: gender-less, effeminate humanoids with special abilities. Aeolia and the Magypsies reveal that Claus visited them on his trek to Drago Plateau, and was granted a special power by them for combat. Knowing this, Flint & Alec head off to the Drago Plateau to find Claus. While scaling the Drago Plateau, Flint & Alec come across several more of the pig-like people who've been recently terrorizing Tazmily Village, and later find a baby Drago playing with a shoe that is unmistakably Claus's. Travelling further, they find Claus's other shoe, and with it, a cybernetic Drago short one fang: the fang that killed Hinawa. Recognizing his wife's murderer, Flint pierces the Drago's hide with its own fang, and fights it until it collapses. However, Alec stops Flint from killing the Drago when its child intervenes, stating that killing the Drago will only throw its child into the same world of grief as Claus & Lucas. However, Alec's words are futile, as the Drago succumbs to its injuries anyways. Flint & Alec then head back to Tazmily Village as the camera pans below the plateau. A body is seen lying face-down, seemingly dead from an apparent fall. It is Claus.Chapter 2: Thief Adventure  The story then switches to Duster's perspective, beginning when he consoles Flint after the latter escapes from jail. The following night, Duster is tasked by his father, Wess, to infiltrate the abandoned Osohe Castle and recover a very important item from it. Taking a series of useful tools with him, Duster heads to the castle, running into a suspicious peddler and his pet monkey along the way. Duster also encounters Butch the farmer, who offered some pigs to the peddler in exchange for a bag full of strange stuff called \"money\". Upon reaching the cemetery, he is briefly attacked by the undead and animate gravestones before successfully infiltrating Osohe Castle. Inside the castle, Duster encounters hordes of ghosts; many of them are quite hostile, though some are actually friendly. Venturing further into the castle, Duster sees a strange girl pass him by, dropping a shining pendant along the way. Duster takes the pendant and fights a ghostly orchestra conductor before finding the Noble Spitoon, which he believes to be the item that Wess was asking for. Duster takes the spitoon and heads back home. However, when the spitoon is presented to Wess, he shatters it in rage, scolding Duster for bringing him the wrong item. Just as he loses faith in his son, Wess notices the pendent that the latter picked up during the previous mission. Wess tells Duster of its importance, and joins him to infiltrate Osohe Castle a second time the following morning. However, their endeavors are complicated by the pig-like people, who are also searching for Wess's very important item. The pig-like people send an electric-powered clay golem after them, but Wess & Duster are able to fight it off until it collapses. The pig-like people, unable to reactivate the golem, retreat. Making their way further into the castle, Wess & Duster are nearly hit with a blast of PK Freeze, and meet the strange girl Duster met before: Kumatora, the tomboy \"princess\" of Osohe Castle. Kumatora begins trusting Wess & Duster after they free her from a bear trap, and begins joining them on their journey for Wess's very important item. Along the way, they find a balcony looking out to the castle's courtyard. In the middle of the courtyard is a glowing, golden needle; Wess explains that when he asked King Osohe about it, the latter gravely stated that it was of no importance. Though Wess seems to be aware that the King was lying about the needle, he dismisses it, as it is not his very important item. Eventually, Wess, Duster, and Kumatora find a room containing the Egg of Light (also referred to as the \"Hummingbird Egg\"): Wess's very important item. However, the pig-like people reach them as well, and are attempting to break down the door with more clay golems. Kumatora hastily takes the Egg of Light, only to open a trap-door that drops her, Wess, and Duster into a pool below the castle. There, they face off against a gigantic snake before being abruptly drained out of the castle. Upon recovering, Kumatora & Wess discover that Duster isn't with them, and go through town to find him. At the town square, however, they are confronted by Butch, who accuses Wess & Duster of stealing the \"money\" that he hid in the well. Kumatora tries to defend the pair, scaring Butch in the process, before Flint steps in and urges everyone to hold their hysteria until Duster returns.Chapter 3: The Suspicious Peddler  The story then switches perspectives yet again, this time focusing on a monkey who was poached from the wild some unknown time ago, along with his girlfriend. The monkey is forced to work for Fassad Yokuba, one of the highest-ranking members of the Pigmask Army. The Pigmasks, named for their pig-like outfits, had previously set fire to a forest near a rural village and began their \"Fascinating Chimera Project\" by converting a caribou and a Drago into cybernetic chimeras. However, the Drago ended up escaping, and the Pigmasks are unable to figure out what happened to it. Nevertheless, the Pigmasks decide to continue their missions across the Nowhere Islands. Chapter 3 begins with a Pigmask airship landing in the Death Desert, a desolate area full of dangerous animals. Fassad forces his captured monkey to work for him, in exchange for the life of the monkey's girlfriend. Naming the monkey \"Salsa\", Fassad equips him with a shock collar that can be activated at the push of a button, for disciplinary use. Grudgingly, Salsa treks through the desert until provoking and defeating a Cactus Wolf, at which point Fassad opens a secret underground passage. The passage ends up leading to a graveyard in a rural village called \"Tazmily\". The town is caught in a state of grief following the death of one of their residents, who was murdered by a hostile Drago. Arriving at night, Fassad & Salsa make their way to the town before bumping into a limping, bad-breathed bum. They also overhear a conversation between the bum and a man who previously gave Fassad some pigs in exchange for money. Fassad learns that the latter man hid his money in the town's well, and takes back the money, knowing that it'll cause an upset in the town. He then decides to stay the night in the town's inn, learning (to his surprise) that the town lacks a monetary system. The next morning, Fassad gathers the townspeople and delivers an elaborate propaganda speech: he states that the world around us has fallen into a state of peril, citing the Pigmasks's acts of terror upon Tazmily Village, and explains that the only way to reclaim peace and happiness is to install Happy Boxes in their homes. Gaining the public's attention, Fassad spreads Happy Boxes all over town, with Salsa stuck as the sole delivery person. Fassad later receives notice that the Pigmasks's raid of Osohe Castle, intended to obtain the Egg of Light, is being interrupted by a second group of amateur raiders. Knowing that the amateurs are in the basement, Fassad forces Salsa to drain the waters at the bottom of the castle, washing away the amateurs-- and the Egg of Light. Angered, Fassad goes back to the inn to stay the night. However, on his way there, he encounters a frenzy erupting in the town square: the man who sold Fassad his pigs is accusing a family in the town of stealing his money. Fassad takes the opportunity to continue his propaganda, while a strange girl in the crowd forms a telepathic connection with Salsa. The next night, Salsa awakes to hear a girl's voice: the same girl he met earlier. She frees him from Fassad's control, aided by an old man, by removing his shock collar and destroying the remote that activates the shocks. However, Fassad wakes up and confronts the group, forcing the latter to run into the forest. Despite their efforts, Salsa and co. are confronted by tanks and soldiers, and are eventually cornered. Right when Fassad prepares to arrest the rebellious group, a blond-haired kid walks on to the scene, along with a baby drago and its mother. At the kid's command, the adult Drago ravages the Pigmasks, forcing them to flee. The chapter ends with a foreshadowing of his future psychological growth.Chapter 4: Club Titiboo  Despite the Pigmasks's defeat at the end of Chapter 3, their influence has successfully spread throughout the Nowhere Islands as a result of the Happy Boxes, which are implied to have brainwashed their owners. The region has become highly modernized, to a point where it resembles America/Eagleland; it even now runs on a monetary system, utilizing a currency called \"Dragon Power\", or DP. Happy Boxes are commonplace in buildings, particularly in the now Onett-esque Tazmily Village, though buildings lacking Happy Boxes are inexplicably destroyed by lightning strikes, with Flint's house being a recurring target. The government also appears to be quite strict, arresting Wess and throwing him into a retirement home for protesting during one of Fassad's speeches. Citizens pledge allegiance to their great \"King P,\" and the Pigmasks hold militaristic, totalitarian law. However, a small group of people still remain skeptical of the new government, and will go on to rebel. The story continues three years after the events of Chapter 3, now taking its final change in perspective and focusing on Lucas; his viewpoint is where the rest of the game is focused. Still grieving his mother's death (albeit no longer publicly displaying it), he starts to grow suspicious after hearing of the appearance of an apparent doppelganger of Duster, who disappeared three years ago. Aided by his dog, Boney, he learns that the suspicious man in question is Lucky, the bassist for the DCMC, who regularly performs at Club Titiboo, near the Clayman Factory, where electrically-powered clay golems are manufactured & maintained. Since he cannot take the train, he travels to the factory through the tunnels; along the way, he runs into the Magypsy Ionia, who allows him to use the Magypsies's special ability: psionic powers, or PSI. Alongside these powers is tier \"\u03b1\" of PK Love, an immensely powerful PSI attack. A surprised Ionia explains that PK Love is a PSI that is hardly ever learned, and learned only by a select group of people. After travelling to the factory, Lucas learns that Club Titiboo is only accessible to factory employees, prompting him to take up a brief part-time job escorting worn-out Claymen to a recharging station. Eventually, Lucas gains access to the club, but is forced to go back due to the club's no-pets-policy... only to return with Boney disguised as a person. However, Lucas & Boney are still denied entrance, and are only admitted in at the recommendation of one of the waitresses, Violet, who claims that Lucas is the legendary Prince Poo. Once inside, Violet reveals to Lucas & Boney that she is actually a disguised Kumatora, who both aided Duster & Wess during their second raid of Osohe Castle and\u00a0connected with Salsa & spearheaded his escape. She promises to explain everything to them after the concert. Following the concert, Kumatora drags Lucas & Boney down a hidden passageway to one of the dressing rooms, where she explains that Lucky is actually an amnesic Duster, who disappeared from public view three years ago after hiding the Egg of Light. However, Kumatora also explains that she has trouble contacting him, as he is regularly kept under security due to his status as a celebrity. As a result, she asks Lucas & Boney to navigate Club Titiboo's attic and infiltrate Lucky's dressing room. After navigating the attic and disposing of the DCMC's sentient, retired, and vengeful bass, Lucas & Boney make it into Lucky's dressing room. There, the DCMC has gathered together, and Lucky reveals to Lucas that he hid the Egg of Light somewhere in the Unknown Valley, but is still trying to remember his true identity. Unable to choose whether to continue living as the DCMC's bassist or become \"Duster\" again and reclaim the egg, he places the decision in the hands of the band, who settle the decision via rock-paper-scissors. The entire band agrees on the fact that Lucky is destined to become Duster again, and utilize coincidence & deception to lose to Lucas on purpose. This convinces Lucky to call himself \"Duster\" again and search for the Egg of Light. Before leaving, he briefly re-lives how he became Lucky: after hiding the Egg and losing his memories, Duster was taken in by the DCMC, who gave him the pseudonym \"Lucky\" and hired him as his bassist. As Lucky, Duster consistently practiced the bass and became a famed member of the DCMC. Before leaving, Duster eavesdrops on the DCMC's first concert without him, where they sing farewell to their departed Lucky...Chapter 5: Tower of Thunder  Trekking through the Unknown Valley (and allowing Boney to remove his disguise), the group eventually comes across the inactive Clayman that Duster hid the Egg of Light in. However, a bolt of lightning supercharges the golem, causing it to get up and run off somewhere. Seeing the monster run off down the highway, Kumatora prompts everyone to go after it. While they follow the Clayman through a nearby warehouse, they are suddenly stopped by a group of Pigmasks. Apparently, Lucas bears a striking resemblance to the Pigmasks' commander-in-chief, to the point where the Pigmasks can't discern the two apart and believe that Lucas is the commander. After being dressed up into proper uniform, Lucas (in the commander's vest & trousers) and company (dressed in Pigmask uniforms) find the Egg-bearing Clayman being driven off to the dump, prompting the group to continue their search down the highway. During the chase, Lucas borrows a Pork Bean from a Pigmask and uses it to better their advantage in the chase. However, the vehicle ends up crashing after slipping on multiple banana peels, presumably dropped by Fassad. This catches the attention of the Pork Trooper, a higher-ranked Pigmask (who also attended the DCMC concert back in Chapter 4). He is eager to help out his \"allies\", but attacks them once his incredibly precise sense of smell allows him to tell them apart from his real comrades. During the fight, he is easily incapacitated by jealousy-- induced by Lucas & co. showing him DCMC merchandise-- and goes down swiftly. Vowing to return, he runs off, leaving behind his own Pork Bean for Lucas to take. Continuing further down the Highway, the group eventually reaches the municipal dump, where Claymen that can no longer function properly are deposited in heaps of clay. Among these heaps is the Clayman bearing the Egg of Light, but before Duster can reclaim it, some of the dump's discarded clay fuses with some other scrap to create a sentient pile of garbage. Lucas & co. manage to defeat this forlorn junk heap and take back the egg; the moment Duster picks it up, he regains all the memories he'd lost three years ago, allowing him to become the same Duster that fought the Reconstructed Caribou with Flint on the Drago Plateau, the same Duster that raided Osohe Castle twice, and the same Duster that was washed away, separated from his father & Kumatora, and hid the Egg of Light in an apparently dead Clayman before losing his memories. However, his celebration is cut short by the Pigmasks, who take the group over to the Thunder Tower. Lucas & co. climb up the tower, learning along the way that it was built for the purpose of destroying homes that refuse to install Happy Boxes by shooting bolts of electricity (this manages to explain the lightning strikes that have repeatedly plagued Lucas's home). After climbing high up the tower and defeating a better-equipped \"Fierce\" Pork Trooper, the group runs into none other than Fassad. He easily discerns Lucas as the blonde-haired kid who sent a Drago to drive off the Pigmasks at the end of Chapter 3, and chases him further up the tower. During Lucas & co's escape, they find their way into a strange playroom belonging to King P. Among other items are a casket from a foreign land, some teddy bears that don't look like they were used since the 1990's, and a jukebox (specifically one that would be better suited for a caf\u00e9 somewhere in a big city) that only plays a song suited for a department store. Climbing further up, Lucas gets struck by a faulty bolt of electricity from a disheveled part of the tower, allowing him to realize the power of PK Flash. He is then driven further up by Fassad, but not without taking the opportunity to destroy the tower's main generator, destroying the tower in turn. Forced onto the roof, Lucas & co. are left to die on the crumbling tower by Fassad. The latter then heads to the Pigmasks' mothership to escape, but a tremor causes him to slip on one of his discarded banana peels and fall to his death. Duster then seizes the opportunity to grab on to the mothership and follow it, with Lucas, Kumatora, and Boney hanging on to him. However, the ship shakes the group off, causing them to scatter about as the Pigmask's real commander-in-chief, a strange masked man, watches them...Chapter 6: Sunflower Fields  What sets Chapter 6 apart from others is its ambiguous setting: it is unknown if the field is where Lucas landed following his fall from the mothership in the previous chapter, or if this is just part of Lucas's imagination (as a form of him coping with Hinawa's death).Chapter 7: The Seven Needles  NOTE: This is one of the longest chapters in the game; as such, it will be divided into several sections based on the commonly-considered chronological order that the needles come into play; note that most of this chapter is non-linear. The first, sixth, and seventh needles must be pulled in the order that they are listed, while the second, third, fourth, and fifth needles can be pulled in any order.The First Needle  The chapter begins with Lucas & Boney waking up in a haystack just outside Tazmily's retirement home. Alec and Wess take Lucas & Boney into the home and explain that they had a dream where Hinawa told them to build a haystack at the exact spot that Lucas & Boney landed. Alec then asks about Duster's whereabouts, and suggests that Lucas see the Magypsies for help. After leaving the retirement home, Lucas hears a commotion nearby and finds Ionia, bound & gagged and left on the bridge. She takes Lucas & Boney upriver to Aeolia's house, where Ionia takes the liberty of freshening up. While Aeolia is talking with the others, a loud tremor occurs outside, and the sky repeatedly changes colors for a brief moment. Aeolia then realizes that she is dying; her needle has been pulled by someone, meaning that it is time for her to vanish from existence. With some parting words, she leaves behind a razor and some lipstick and uses the last of her remaining PSI to open up a secret passageway beneath her tea table. Lucas, Ionia, and Boney follow it to find that it ends at the courtyard of Osohe Castle, the resting place of Aeolia's Needle. There, the golden needle that was previously visible in Chapter 2 is gone, with a hole secreting purple smoke left in its wake. Lonia explains that the needle is one of seven that conceal a special power, only accessible once all seven are pulled. She fears the worst, believing that whoever pulled Aeolia's needle may have a dark heart, or no heart at all. Lonia provides an in-depth explanation on how the Seven Needles work: The needles can only be pulled by those who know the PK Love ability. When a needle is pulled, the puller passes their heart on to the Dark Dragon that sleeps beneath the Nowhere Islands. When all the needles are pulled, the dragon will awaken, and the result will either be beneficial (if the needles were pulled by a goodhearted person) or catastrophic (if the needles were pulled by a person with a dark heart); however, there is no telling what will happen if the needles were pulled by a heartless person. Ionia then leaves, asking Lucas to pull the rest of the needles before whoever pulled Aeolia's does, and Lucas finds a transceiver phone similar to Fassad's. Answering a call on it, Lucas learns that the next needle is near the Chimera Laboratory.The Second Needle  After returning to the surface via the Osohe Waterways, Boney drags Lucas to Hinawa's grave. There, Nippolyte the grave keeper is paying his respects to Hinawa. Upon noticing Lucas, he gives him the Courage Badge, saying that it is a present from Flint. Nippolyte also muses over how Hinawa's murder and Claus's disappearance has destroyed Flint's life: Flint's routine consists solely of mourning Hinawa, searching for Claus, mourning Hinawa, searching for Claus, etc. Lucas & Boney head off to find the Chimera Lab. At the Murasaki Forest, Lucas & Boney come across the Chimera Lab and infiltrate it by taking a part-time job there. Donning Pigmask helmets, the two are tasked with finding two monkeys due for experimentation that have escaped: Salsa & Samba. Taking the opportunity to explore the place, Lucas & Boney learn of the brutal practices that occur in the lab, several of which are eerily Mengele-esque. Eventually, the duo finds Salsa & Samba, but the latter run off after mistaking the former for Pigmasks. Meanwhile, the chimeras appear to have gone rogue, and Lucas & Boney are attacked by an unfinished, cybernetic lion chimera. After a Clayman incapacitates the lion, the lab hears news that the Ultimate Chimera has escaped and is terrorizing the workers. The Pigmasks explain that the Ultimate Chimera is unbeatable, and will instantly stalk anyone it sees, usually killing them with its powerful jaws and razor-sharp teeth. A state of emergency is declared in the lab as the Ultimate Chimera continues its massacre... Lucas & Boney continue searching for Salsa & Samba, while simultaneously trying to avoid the jaws of the Ultimate Chimera. Along the way, they see an old man hiding in a trash can. He introduces himself as Dr. Andonuts, and explains that he is being forced to work as the Pigmasks' chief technological developer. Previous details in the game show this his other inventions included the Claymen and the Instant Revitalizing Machines stationed in several locations. Later, Lucas & Boney manage to corner Salsa & Samba in the basement, but they escape and flee to the far-east room on the first floor. There, Lucas & Boney corner the monkeys again, but are cornered in turn by... the Ultimate Chimera. Fearing for their lives, Lucas & Boney flee, dropping their disguises and allowing Salsa to recognize Lucas as the blonde kid who, with the help of a Drago, freed him from Fassad and the Pigmasks three years ago. As Lucas & Boney try to stay alive, Dr. Andonuts reveals that he gave the Ultimate Chimera a precautionary weakness: the big red button on its back serves as a power switch for the chimera, which went rogue before the switch could be removed. As the Ultimate Chimera pounces at Lucas, Salsa suddenly jumps in and hits the switch, deactivating the chimera. With the threat incapacitated, Lucas & Boney go off to continue their original search for the second needle. However, as they leave, the yellow bird that rests on the Ultimate Chimera's head jumps down and presses the chimera's switch, re-activating the beast and allowing it to escape the lab and run off into the wild... Continuing onwards, Salsa uses one of his tricks to perform a special dance that allows him to open a previously-unopenable door for Lucas & Boney. Through it is the house of the Magypsy Doria, with an additional guest: Kumatora, who was taken in by Doria after falling from the mothership back in Chapter 5. Knowing that Lucas must be the one to awaken the Dark Dragon, she reveals that her needle is beneath the pond outside her house. With the help of Dr. Andonuts and a special chimera, Lucas is able to reveal the second needle. Meanwhile, Kumatora bids farewell to Salsa, who gives her a nut as a parting gift. With all his might, Lucas grasps the needle and tears it out of the earth, causing the same pseudo-apocalyptic phenomenon as when Aeolia's needle was pulled; Lucas also learns PK Love \u03b2 as an aftershock of the event. Doria disappears, and Lucas, Boney, and Kumatora continue searching for the rest of the needles.The Third Needle  After leaving Doria's house and defating an unruly mouse, Lucas & co. run into the Mole Cricket that play-fought with Lucas & Claus during their visit to Mt. Oriander at the very beginning of the game. He invites Lucas to a rematch in the Mole Cricket Hole. There, Lucas easily defeats the Mole Cricket and continues through the tunnel with his friends, eventually reaching the other side at Snowcap Mountain. There, Lucas & co. encounter Lydia, the Magypsy of Snowcap Mountain's needle. She invites the group in, where it is revealed that she is incredibly warmhearted to everyone-- even a stranded Pigmask Captain that remains in her home. Lydia state that her needle is behind her house. Hearing the sounds of Pigmask airships, Lucas & co. rush outside-- just in time to witness the pulling of Lydia's needle by the Pigmasks' commander-in-chief, the Masked Man. Lucas and the Masked Man form a telepathic connection with each other, revealing to Lucas that the Masked Man is a heartless being. The Masked Man departs, leaving the group to fight the Steel Mechorilla. After the Mechorilla's defeat, Lydia urges Lucas to be the one to awaken the Dark Dragon, and asks to check on the Pigmask Captain, then disappears into thin air like Aeolia & Doria. When leaving, the Pigmask Captain is seen tending for Lydia's pet rabbits in her absence. He is also unmasked, revealing that the Pigmasks are just regular people who've sworn their ultimate allegiance to the Pig King. Lucas, Kumatora, and Boney leave Snowcap Mountain and head back to Tazmily by launching a refrigerator off the top of the mountain. Landing in the cemetery, Lucas spots a strange jar that opens a peculiar nearby grave. Lucas & co. jump down the hole and continue their adventure. Meanwhile, people are leaving Tazmily in droves, heading off to seek better lives in the big city.The Fourth Needle  The hole leads to an underground tunnel, specifically the one used by Fassad to go from the Death Desert to Tazmily Village in Chapter 3; the entrance to the desert is closed. Lucas & co. follow the passageway until they find a strange coffee table that is actually a form of ground transport. The group rides the table down the highway until reaching the closed entrance to Thunder Tower. There, a previously-closed pathway is made accessible, leading to a strange area called Saturn Valley. The area is populated by a race of bizarre creatures called Mr. Saturns, who've been taken hostage by invading Pigmasks. The Pigmasks know that there is a needle nearby, and are torturing the Mr. Saturns via scary stories told by Frightbots. Among the Mr. Saturns is Duster, who was taken in by the Mr. Saturns following his fall in Chapter 5. Lucas, Kumatora, and Boney drive out the Pigmasks and free the Mr. Saturns & Duster. In return, the Mr. Saturns allow Lucas, Kumatora, Duster, and Boney to access Fire Mountain, where the fourth needle lies. At the base of Fire Mountain is the home of Phrygia, the sleeping Magypsy. Being mainly focused on beauty rest, she provides Lucas with some Encouraging Words to tell the boulders blocking the path to the mountain, so that the boulders will move out of the way; Lucas follows suit. With a clear path, Lucas and co. trek deeper into the mountain, facing numerous tough enemies along the way. At some point, they encounter a group of Pigmasks gossiping about how Fassad's \"changed\" since the events of Chapter 5. However, they notice Lucas and flee before they can divulge any more information. This piques curiosity, given the fact that Fassad apparently died after falling from Thunder Tower. This curiosity is answered once Lucas and co. reach the fourth needle: a voice shouts \"'I've found you! I've finally found you! Nwehehehehe!' is what Fassad says!\" Descending upon the group is Fassad, who actually survived his fall from Thunder Tower and was given cybernetic enhancements to ensure his survival. However, he is left unable to speak any known language, instead producing a distorted variation of the Magypsies' leitmotif; this forces him to travel with an interpreter, who translates his music into language. Fassad, now calling himself \"New Fassad\" in reference to his condition, divulges on the humiliation he suffered after falling from Thunder Tower. Swearing revenge, he suddenly attacks Lucas & co, presenting a truly difficult fight. However, New Fassad is eventually defeated, and flees while declaring that he will return. With all his might, Lucas pulls the fourth needle, prompting Phrygia to wake up for the first time in the game, just to witness the event and bid farewell. Lucas learns PK Love \u03b4 from the needle, and heads off to find the fifth needle. However, a single Pigmask Major destroys the exit to Saturn Valley, leaving Lucas and co. trapped. Turning the tables back in Lucas's favor, the Mr. Saturns are able to build a flying machine using a wire cage and several birds, some of which Lucas catches as contribution. During this time, one Mr. Saturn takes Lucas's Courage Badge in order to clean it, and another Mr. Saturn provides the group with coffee. As the coffee is consumed, messages of encouragement are relayed to the group against a psychedelic background in a familiar format. The machine is able to fly Lucas & co. out of Saturn Valley before falling into the ocean and washing up at Cerulean Beach. Upon waking up, they decide to continue the search for the remaining three needles.The Fifth Needle  Learning that the next needle is on an island on the other side of the ocean, Lucas & co. decide to swim there, lacking any other form of transport. Walking into the water, the group traverses the seabed, refilling their lungs when necessary via suggestively-designed oxygen suppliers. Eventually, the group is pulled into the currents of an aquatic entity known as Master Eddy, who engages them in battle. Master Eddy puts up a strong fight, attacking twice each turn. Just as he's about to be defeated, he summons a gigantic whirlpool that instantly defeats the group, washes away their items, and sends them to drift the waves unconscious... The group washes up on the shores of Tanetane Island, weak and with little chance of survival. Their lack of items (and Lucas & Kumatora's lack of sufficient PP) prevents them from healing, and their path is blocked by a Zombieshroom too strong for them to defeat. With no other choice, Lucas, Kumatora, and Duster ingest some strange purple mushrooms; Boney refuses to eat them, sensing something suspicious. While the mushrooms do heal Lucas, Kumatora, and Duster completely, they turn out to be psilocybin mushrooms and induce a series of tormenting hallucinations. All the creatures on the island appear to the affected group as people they know, who spout messages reflecting the group's darker sides, particularly their fears, tragic memories, and other negative emotions. Lucas seems to be affected the most, seeing himself as below everyone else and deserving of scorn. These figures also attack the group when talked to, taking the form of Eerie Smiles before later revealing their true forms. Eventually, the group reaches the house of the Magypsy Mixolydia, who appears unusually feminine and beautiful for the normally masculine-looking Magypsies. She also appears with Ocho, a suave-looking sailor. Mixolydia immediately recognizes that Lucas & co. ingested the island's Hallucination Mushrooms, and reverses its effects by smacking each of them on the back of the head using a board of wood. Once the effects wear off, she and Ocho appear to the group in their actual state: a pink-haired humanoid with a masculine physique, and a large, magenta octopus with a black cap. Mixolydia allows the group to stay the night at her house, while Ocho gives them all the items they lost during the fight against Master Eddy; Ocho explains that he regularly combs the beaches of Tanetane Island, and happened to come across the group's items. Mixolydia allows the group to go after her needle, but warns that it is well-guarded. Once the group reaches the site, they understand why: it is guarded by the Barrier Trio, three large golems consisting of Barrier Man, Barrier Dude, and Barrier Gal. The Barrier Trio manages to prove themselves as a formidable force, but are defeated anyways by Lucas & co. However, before Lucas can pull the needle, the Pigmasks arrive, and the Masked Man incapacitates Lucas & co. with a bolt of lightning from his energy sword. The Masked Man then pulls the needle and flies off. Mixolydia then arrives, despairing over the increasing advance of the Pigmasks. Before she disappears, she gives Lucas a Jar of Yummy Pickles to give to Ionia. NOTE: If the player had Lucas pull the third, fourth, and fifth needles in an order different than the one provided here, then the Magypsy of the last needle of these three will be the one to give Lucas the Jar of Yummy Pickles (i.e. Lydia will give the jar if her needle is pulled last, and Phrygia will give the jar if her needle is pulled last). Lucas & co. then ride home on Ocho's back, only to find out that Tazmily is nearly devoid of life. Nearly everyone has left the village in search of a better life in the big city, leaving Tazmily destined to become a ghost town. Knowing that there's no reason to keep living in Tazmily, Lucas leads the group to Ionia's house, hoping to find the last two needles...The Sixth Needle  Making their way through the Argilla Pass, the group eventually reaches Ionia's house. There, she takes the Jar of Yummy Pickles and provides the group with Waters of Time to sprinkle on the time-locked vines in front of the Chupichupyoi Temple, so that they will clear out and make the entrance to the temple accessible. Lucas and co. head off to the temple; along the way, they bump into a hooded Mr. Saturn that gives back Lucas's Courage Badge. Upon being cleaned it is revealed to be a Franklin Badge, a legendary artifact said to deflect bolts of electricity. At the Chupichupyoi Temple, the Pigmasks are trying in vain to break through the vines that block the entrance. Just as the Masked Man grows impatient and tries to bomb the entrance open, Lucas and company arrive. Lucas forms another telepathic link with the Masked Man, who fires another intense bolt of lightning at him. This time, however, the bolt is reflected off of Lucas's Franklin Badge and back at the Masked Man. Learning that Lucas & co have grown too strong to simply brush aside, the Masked Man engages them in battle. His status as the commander-in-chief of the Pigmasks easily shows, as he is one of the toughest opponents in the entire game. However, Lucas & co. eventually manage to defeat him, prompting him & his army to retreat. With the Pigmasks gone, Lucas pours the Waters of Time onto the temple's vines, which quickly mature and wither away, leaving the doors open. Inside the temple lies Ionia's needle. The temple also contains a mural, which depicts the concept of majority rule: when the Seven Needles are all pulled, whoever pulled the most needles will be the one who awakens the Dark Dragon. Before it can be pulled, Ionia walks in and gives Kumatora a parting gift: she teaches her the power of PK Starstorm. With preparations in order, Lucas pulls the sixth needle and realizes the amazing power of PK Love \u03a9, the strongest tier of the attack. Ionia then disappears, orphaning Kumatora, who was taken in by Ionia as a surrogate daughter many years ago. With a race to the final needle underway, Lucas & co. are stopped by a well-dressed man who claims to represent the king, whom he refers to as \"Porky\". He claims that the king has invited Lucas and his friends to go to New Pork City, the same \"big city\" that everyone's already migrated to. Without any explanation, Lucas & co. accept the offer and head to the big city like everyone else...Chapter 8: All Things... Isn't This Such a Utopia?  At New Pork City, all the residents of Tazmily Village live in perfect glory. The town captures the very essence of capitalist life, from the stores to the skyscrapers. Even more noteworthy are the numerous images of King Porky scattered throughout the town; these effigies finally clarify that the fabled Pig King is actually Pokey Minch, who was last seen in the EarthBound series's timeline fleeing from the Cave of the Past following the destruction of the Embodiment of Evil, Giygas. It becomes clear that Pokey ended up founding & leading the Pigmask Army, and is now the king of the Nowhere Islands. It can also be inferred that Pokey changed his name to \"Porky\" at some point, for reasons unknown (also note that \"Porky\" is the character's Japanese name in MOTHER2 [Japanese version of EarthBound], and the name \"Pokey\" was a mistranslation; the preceding sentence serves as a way of addressing this by taking the MOTHER trilogy's content into full account). At some point, Lucas and co. are drawn into the city's cinema theater, which perpetually airs a film chronicling the events of EarthBound. What's more important, however, is a foul odor coming from the seats that turns out to be the result of a Stink Bug. Boney chases the bug through a broken speaker, disappearing from sight. Lucas, Duster, and Kumatora follow him into the sewers through an entrance in the New Pork Arcade, revealed by a man complaining of the air quality. The group retrieves Boney in a slum of abandoned apartments inside the sewers. More important is that one of these apartments houses \"Beanstalk\" Leder, the old bell-ringer of Tazmily who remained unseen for quite some time. Leder was clearly taken prisoner by the Pigmasks, as seen by his legs being chained up in an apartment below. When the group goes up to him, he speaks for the first time in the game; he clarifies that he wasn't a mute, but rather chose not to speak unless it was absolutely necessary. Leder then takes the opportunity to divulge everything he knows about the history of the Nowhere Islands:The Truth  Long ago, a world spanning much farther than the Nowhere Islands existed, and was populated with innumerable people. Eventually, the world was destroyed by mankind, who sought refuge aboard a White Ship, created for the sole purpose of saving mankind in the event of an apocalypse. The ship ended up taking them to the Nowhere Islands, where they were protected by and coexisted with the Dark Dragon. However, mankind soon realized that they couldn't live together with the Dragon anymore. As a result, a group of special people used the Seven Needles to place the Dragon in a state of suspended animation, hiding it beneath the earth. These people and their descendants, the Magypsies, guarded the needles until the Dragon's power was absolutely necessary. Fearing another apocalypse, the people of the Nowhere Islands decided to wipe their memories using the Egg of Light and start over, believing that it was the lifestyle of our world that brought about the end. Keeping their original names, they founded Tazmily village and live their lives out in peace and harmony, unable to remember anything from the distant past (according to Leder, they wanted to create a plethora of myths and legends, but were unable to due to the memory alteration process being done in haste). In order to keep everyone's memories from reverting, Leder's mind was not wiped, being chosen specifically because his incredible height made him stand out. Serving as Tazmily's bell ringer, the sound of the bell would keep people's new memories intact via \"a suggestion\", and he was tasked with divulging the truth about Tazmily when it was truly necessary: now. On a brief note of tangent, a kingdom existed long ago, led by the king of Osohe, before the White Ship arrived on the Nowhere Islands. However, the kingdom disappeared long before the White Ship's arrival, but still played a vital role in the development of Tazmily: Kumatora was an orphan when she was taken aboard the White Ship. Upon arriving at the Nowhere Islands, she was taken into the care of the Magypsies and given the role of Osohe Castle's princess. Tying into this were the assignment of Wess & Duster as Kumatora's retainers. Although the people of Tazmily didn't know how their charade would turn out, they were able to live in peace for ages... until Porky arrived. Using the Phase Distorter I that he stole from Dr. Andonuts during the events of EarthBound, Porky traveled through time and space, eventually arriving at the Nowhere Islands, unable to return to his own era. He learned about the secrets of the islands' people from Locria, the seventh Magypsy. Using this knowledge, he brought people from previous time periods onto the islands using the Phase Distorter, and brainwashed them into becoming his servants, creating the Pigmask Army. The citizens of New Pork City were also subjected to brainwashing as well. Viewing the world as his own personal toy box, Porky reshaped the land to his liking, resulting in the Fascinating Chimera Project and the modernized Tazmily. After learning about the Seven Needles and the Dark Dragon from Locria, Porky decided to pull the needles and use the Dragon's power for himself. However, the only people capable of pulling the needle are the select few who are capable of learning PK Love, meaning that neither Porky nor the Magypsies could pull the needles. This ultimately clarifies that the Masked Man is being used as Porky's proxy to pull the needles, and Lucas is the only one who can stop him. Leder, honoring the word \"leader\" that serves as his namesake, orders Lucas to pull the final needle and awaken the Dark Dragon before the Masked Man does, concerned for the fate of reality itself...The Ultimate Mission  Taking Leder's orders to heart, Lucas, Duster, Kumatora, and Boney head out of the sewers to begin their mission. On the way out, they are ambushed by New Fassad, now updated and renamed \"Miracle Fassad\". Miracle Fassad divulges on his passionate hatred towards the group for defeating him in Fire Mountain, and attacks them out of revenge (again). During the fight, Miracle Fassad catches the group off-guard when he hits them with PK Starstorm, revealing that he is capable of learning PSI. Despite this intense buff, Miracle Fassad is eventually defeated. Damaged beyond repair, Miracle Fassad delivers a testament that all of the events that have taken place so far are all part of Porky's \"game\". Claiming freedom from the game (both figuratively and literally), Miracle Fassad self-destructs, the wreckage falling into the sewers, dead. On the streets of New Pork City, more and more people have began to gather, indicating that something big is about to occur. Lucas & co. acknowledge this and begin to traverse the Empire Porky Building, intending to confront Porky himself. Along the way, they run into the DCMC, who are about to hold their last concert ever. Duster temporarily re-joins the band for this one last outing, and the DCMC holds their biggest performance ever, promising an indefinitely long show. However, the concert is interrupted by a power outage, committed by Porky himself. Porky knows what Lucas & co. are trying to do, and personally request that they meet him on the 100th floor. The group climbs higher and higher up the building. On one floor, they find the Ultimate Chimera, who found its way to New Pork City following its escape from the Chimera Lab. The creature poses a smaller threat this time, as it is isolated to a single hallway and is easily bypassable. Of more importance, however, is that one of the floors contains the house of Locria, the traitorous Magypsy. The house contains a pair of brass horns, a plethora of Luxury Bananas, and a familiar peddler's outfit. In addition, a nearby mouse describes that Locria was seen as disturbing by the other Magypsies, and had an unsettling \"Nwehehehehe!\" laugh. Despite this, the mouse was good friends with Locria, whose return he awaits. All of this implies that Locria, the seventh Magypsy, was actually Fassad... Another floor contains a strange laboratory, concealing an even stranger room: the Nice Person Hot Springs. Here, people are kept in incubator tanks reminiscent of the ones on Mt. Itoi and inside Stonehenge Base. Inside these tanks, people are immersed in an unknown green fluid, somehow being psychologically manipulated into obeying Porky... Eventually, Lucas & co. reach the last few floors, where the chauffeur who took the group to the city in the first place greets them. He explains that he is also the host of several games that everyone must pass in order to meet Porky. In these games, Lucas plays against a robotic duplicate of the Pig King, dubbed \"Mini-Porky\". However, Lucas isn't supposed to win-- he's supposed to lose to the Mini-Porky by a narrow margin. Eventually, Lucas passes each of the games and is granted access to meet Porky. Along the way, he, Duster, Kumatora, and Boney face off against Porky's last trial: the Natural Killer Cyborg, a cybernetic super-machine capable of incredibly powerful attacks. Despite its brawn, the group manages to destroy it before continuing their trek to the 100th floor.Reunions and Revelations  On the 99th floor, the group finds a long, empty hallway, where the loudspeakers play a soft, ambient tune: the title theme to EarthBound Beginnings, the original MOTHER. Even more notable is what lies behind the door at the end of the hallway: the Hall of Memories. Here, Porky has collected numerous pieces of memorabilia from the events of EarthBound, and showcases it via a ride on a boat designed after his old next-door neighbor's house. Porky's also kept the Pencil Eraser, whose sole purpose is to destroy a nearby Iron Pencil, which has rusted considerably in the events between EarthBound and Mother 3. Finally at the 100th floor, the group comes face-to-face with Porky Minch. He asks that the group engages in peaceful negotiation talks with him, before exploding, regardless of the response. In reality, the group met one of eleven Mecha-Porkies, and the other ten ambush the group and fight. Seven of the ten robots are destroyed by the group, but the former gains the upper hand by overwhelming the latter with reinforcements: miscellaneous enemies and other Mecha-Porkies. However, the DCMC suddenly bursts in and destroys the remaining robots, explaining along the way that they figured out how Porky was able to win the allegiance of Tazmily in the first place: brainwashing them through the DCMC's music. The band finally gets its revenge and helps the group win the battle. In the fight's aftermath, the residents of Tazmily (except Isaac, who became a Pigmask between Chapters 7 and 8) gather on the 100th floor to meet Porky. Obligingly, the Pig King appears for them-- descending from the ceiling on his  life-support bed. Porky has aged tremendously since his last sighting in EarthBound, and is in ill health. Porky admonishes Tazmily for thinking that it could escape its past by altering their memories, and divulges on his sadistic nature. He also reveals that the seventh and final needle, Locria's Needle, has been discovered beneath New Pork City itself. On this note, he goes off, and drops Lucas, Duster, Kumatora, Boney, and Flint down into a cavern innumerable miles beneath the earth...The Seventh Needle  Inside the cavern, the group gradually descends into the lowest passageway, where the needle is sure to be hidden. At some point, Flint stops the group and continues on his own, growing suspicious on the Masked Man's identity. Lucas, Duster, Kumatora, and Boney follow after him. When everyone catches up, Flint makes a startling revelation: the Masked Man is Claus. After falling from the Drago Plateau in Chapter 1, Claus was taken by the Pigmasks and converted into the perfect Chimera for Porky's use. Flint, while shocked at this discovery, finally earns closure; his three-year search for Claus has finally come to an end. As Lucas, Duster, Kumatora, and Boney continue onwards to the final needle, they are suddenly stopped by Porky, who engages them in battle. During their fight, Porky explains everything he hasn't told them. Because of his repeated time travel, his age accelerated to a point where he has petrified and is dependent on his bed mecha for interaction. He has also been rendered immortal, meaning that even if he is defeated, he can still return, regardless of his situation. Porky also claims that the Masked Man's lack of a heart means that if he is the one to awaken the Dark Dragon, then all of reality will be erased, a possibility Porky is \"more than prepared for.\" Eventually, Porky's machine runs out of power, leaving him helpless, but still immortal. Seeking escape, Porky seals himself inside the Absolutely Safe Capsule, a device built for him by Dr. Andonuts and the Mr. Saturns. The capsule keeps Porky protected from all harm, but he is unable to do anything in turn. By default, the battle ends... At this point, Dr. Andonuts appears. He explains that he repeatedly warned Porky not to use the Absolutely Safe Capsule, because once it is closed, it can never be reopened: the capsule wasn't designed to protect whatever's inside from outside harm, but rather to protect the world from whatever's inside. Since Porky is now isolated from the rest of the world, his claim about always being able to return has been disproven. Yet, since Porky's goal was to be freed from everyone that disliked him and everything he disliked, fleeing into the Absolutely Safe Capsule may have given Porky exactly what he wanted. In the meantime, Dr. Andonuts gives Porky childish payback in the form of rolling the Absolutely Safe Capsule back and forth.Claus  Eventually, the group reaches the seventh needle-- and Claus. Still under Porky's influence, he fires an intense bolt of lightning at the group. This time, he manages to knock out everyone but Lucas, whose Franklin Badge deflects the lightning back at him again. With the circumstances narrowed down, Claus & Lucas duel. During the fight, Lucas's grief prevents him from fighting Claus, leaving him only able to defend himself. Claus easily overpowers his brother with laser attacks, PK Love, and the like. However, a voice starts to echo across the battlefield: Hinawa's voice. Calling from beyond, she pleads the brothers to stop fighting, focusing most of her attention on the mindless, heartless Claus. While her words are initially futile, Hinawa eventually reaches Claus, who starts to become tormented by his reawakening memories. He responds by increasing his firepower, and prepares to kill Lucas with a blast of PK Love. However, Flint jumps out and takes the blast for Lucas. Flint attempts to speak to Claus, but is further incapacitated by another blast of PK Love. Angered, Lucas gains the courage to fight, but is initially scolded by Hinawa and becomes heartbroken during subsequent attacks. Eventually, Hinawa awakens one final memory in Claus: the day he and Lucas received their names. He remembers Hinawa & Flint sharing their ambitions for their children, and starts to remember who he really is. With Claus starting to revert to his original self, he becomes considerably weakened by his emotions. Overcome by all of this, he eventually removes his helmet, signifying that he is once again Claus, and no longer the Masked Man. However, he is wracked with ages of grief: Hinawa's murder, his failed attempt at revenge, his conversion into a chimera, and the flood of emotions Hinawa's ghost surged into him. Unable to handle any of it anymore, Claus kills himself, firing one last lightning bolt at Lucas, intentionally reflecting it off of Lucas's Franklin Badge and back at him. Severely electrocuted and nearing death, he staggers towards Lucas and collapses into his arms. Claus then gives one final goodbye to what is left of his family, and takes his final breath...It Is Finished  Lucas rises and takes in the requiem. Flint asks Lucas to forgive Claus for his actions, and then instructs Lucas to pull the final needle and awaken the Dark Dragon. Lucas walks over to the needle, firmly grasps it in his hands, and, with all of his might, pulls it out of the earth. Having pulled four out of the seven needles, Lucas awakens the Dark Dragon, resulting in an event unlike any other. Awakened from its long slumber, the Dark Dragon summons a second apocalypse, this time destroying the Pigmasks and its influences on the Nowhere Islands. The world crumbles once more, and when the Pigmask mothership is struck down by a stray piece of brimstone, it becomes clear that the Pigmasks are gone forever. The scene then fades to black, leaving only some text saying \"END...?\" If the player uses the D-Pad at this point, the \"END...?\" text will move away, and, regardless of how they push the D-Pad, the player themself will walk around the dark screen. By doing this, they are able to interact with the game's characters, whose fates are left ambiguous (though it is slightly implied and often accepted that they survived; those definitely included within the group are Kumatora, Wess, a Mr. Saturn, a mole cricket, a save frog, Porky, the Rope Snake, and Boney). The characters discuss the second apocalypse, which was enough to make Kumatora cry for the first time. Some of them (such as the aforementioned Kumatora) are recovering from their fears, while others describe the event as \"a miracle\" and look forward to the future. Along the way, the player finds the doorknob that Thomas pulled off of Flint's front door back in Chapter 1, and tucks it away. An object implied to be the Absolutely Safe Capsule is among the party, wobbling \"with glee.\" Several of the characters in the area also express joy and relief that the player survived the apocalypse, and a character implied to be Lucas bids the player farewell, hoping that they will meet again. After the cast roll and credits finish, the screen whites out. The Mother 3 logo then appears, made entirely of wood instead of metal & wood; the sole exception is the \"O\", which is replaced by the planet Earth. This screen is a homage to the Japanese title screen of EarthBound Beginnings. Below the logo is the text \"END\". Unlike the previous games in the franchise, which leave behind implications of a possible sequel, this game ends off with a definitive \"END\".Connections to EarthBound Beginings and EarthBound Development  Mother 3 was originally announced in 1996 for the Nintendo 64. Development soon moved to the Nintendo 64DD, where it was to be a launch title, but after many delays caused by the inexperience of the development team with the hardware and 3D graphics, it was canceled in August 2000. The project was revived in 2003, now with 2D graphics on the Game Boy Advance. EarthBound 64 was a canceled game that was going to be released for the Nintendo 64 and then on the Nintendo 64DD. Several years later it was revealed that the project had started up again for the Game Boy Advance under the form of Mother 3. Much of the story seems to be based on the information known about EarthBound 64, including the four main characters, and a plot involving a Pigmask Army, but it is unknown how close its plot is to that of Mother 3 as little is known of the game. Developer Benimaru Itoh remarked at E3's 1997 convention that the game would probably utilize the Rumble Pak in battle sequences, but worried that the controller would become too cumbersome for players given the time-consuming nature of role-playing games. Itoh also aimed to allow players to pick several character faces or create new visages with Mario Artist. Shigesato Itoi's team ran into some trouble while developing this game, primarly because of their inexperience with 3D games and the difficulty of developing for Nintendo 64 hardware. The final nail in the coffin, which was the Nintendo 64DD's failure, destroyed all hope for the game. On August 21, 2000, Itoi officially confirmed the game's cancellation.Mother 3 Deluxe Box  A limited release version of Mother 3 version was sold in Japan in addition to the basic title. This \"Deluxe Box\" included a copy of Mother 3 for the Game Boy Advance, a Special Edition Game Boy Micro and a Franklin Badge for \u00a518,000. Pre-orders began on March 1, 2006, continuing until the release of the game on April 20 of that year. Upon meeting an unexpected demand, only a small fraction of the Deluxe Boxes were shipped by the release date of the game.Marketing  Beginning in February 2006, lead designer Shigesato Itoi initiated a systematic divulgence of Mother 3 information on the official Mother 3 website (https://www.1101.com/MOTHER3/). The additions are documented below: This information, which was rationed out on a weekly basis until the April 20 release date, can be found at the official Mother 3 website.Demand for an international release  Since the original, scrapped, Nintendo 64 version's announcement in 1996, many fans of the Mother series have been pleading for Mother 3 to be given a global release. A cult following has formed around the franchise, and many petitions and demands have been made towards Nintendo of America; however, there do not appear to be any plans to release Mother 3 in North America as EarthBound 2. Rumors in the August 2006 issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly suggested the possibility that Nintendo may compile all three Mother titles onto one Nintendo DS cartridge, and could possibly be released in North America and Europe. These have been proven false, however, following Nintendo's shift in focus to handheld games for the Nintendo 3DS. In November of 2006, NintendoWorldReport.com interviewed Nate Bihldorff, the Nintendo of America Localization Producer/Manager, about the localization process he and his team must go through for a video game. When NintendoWorldReport.com mentioned Mother 3, Bihldorff stated that he and his team were not working on Mother 3. However, he does mention some of his writers are not under him, so discussions of the game may be going on. He also mentions that he does not plan on working on it in the immediate future. Because no official translation has been announced, a fan translation was developed over the course of roughly two years, and released on October 17, 2008. When this translation \"patch\" is applied to a Japanese ROM of Mother 3, it converts all of the Japanese text on the ROM to English. Throughout the progress made on the project, lead developers Tomato and Jeffman were firm in stating that if Nintendo announced an official localization of Mother 3, they would immediately cease their work, indicating that their sole goal was to ensure that the game was translated to English.Music  Mother 3 has spawned two soundtrack releases. The first, Mother 3+, was released in Japan on November 2, 2006, consisting of arranged songs by the Crazy Ken Band as DCMC, and a vocal track by Taeko Onuki, as well as some songs from previous installments of the series. It was later released in the iTunes Music Store in North America on April 1, 2007, featuring an additional bonus track unavailable on the CD release. Mother 3+ is no longer available for purchase in North America. The second soundtrack, Mother 3i, was released on the February 6, 2007 in the iTunes Music Store and Napster in Japan, as well as a few other online music services. Mother 3i, like Mother 3+ is no longer available in North America for unknown reasons. It contains a different selection of music from the game. It was composed by Sh\u014dgo Sakai and contains a different selection of music from the game than the Mother 3+. Songs from the album also appear in Super Smash Bros. Brawl in their original or remixed form.Reception  Famitsu scored Mother 3 with a 35/40 (one point higher than EarthBound), providing the first public review of the game. Australian publication Hyper Magazine gave it 92/100, and the \"Hyper Big Rubber Stamp of Approval\" (awarded to all games with a score over ninety), and was said to be \"One of the best RPG's ever made.\" Destructoid, a general gaming site, named it the third best game of the decade, declaring that \"Mother 3 may have the most complex, mature, and heart-wrenching story of any videogame of the last decade.\" Mother 3 sold 205,914 copies in its first 3 days on sale, and 338,382 copies were sold from April 20 to June 25 in Japan.Trivia External links Claus  Claus (\u30af\u30e9\u30a6\u30b9, Klaus in the North American version of Brawl) is a major character in Mother 3. He is a boy from Tazmily Village, and the older twin brother of Lucas. Claus looks very similar to Lucas other than the different colors of his clothing and hair, though he is energetic and far more courageous than Lucas. He is last seen by the player lying motionless near the Drago Plateau, although the residents of Tazmily are never made aware of this. It is not explicitly stated that Claus is alive until the end of Chapter 8, where it is revealed he is being exploited for his ability to use the elusive PK Love by Porky Minch.Appearance  Claus resembles Lucas in every way, except for the color of his clothes and hair. He has a similar hairstyle to Lucas, but he has orange hair, and wears a striped T-Shirt that resembles his brother's; With the colors different. They are Yellow and Cyan. He wears orange pants, white socks and cyan-white shoes. However, when he is in his masked man uniform, his appearance becomes slightly different. He wears a long yellow shirt instead of his causal short striped shirt, although it cannot be seen very well because of his black-gray coat. However, he still wears his orange pants. He wears black-grayish boots.Masked Man  The Masked Man is is the secondary antagonist of\u00a0Mother 3; a mysterious\u00a0character who debuts during the final scene of the fifth chapter.\u00a0He is the only other person besides Lucas capable of removing the seven Needles. He attacks with lightning, a sword, an arm cannon and PK Love. Additionally, he has the ability to destroy PSI Shields and use mechanical wings to fly away. He also has a lightning attack that is able to instantly render Lucas's entire party unconscious, meaning that only himself and Lucas (because of the Courage Badge that was revealed to be a Franklin Badge) remain in the battle. The attack is unavoidable. The Masked Man works for Porky Minch, the Pig King, as what he refers to as his \"adorable little monster,\" and never says a word in the story onscreen. A Pigmask states to Lucas (who thought he was the Masked Man since he answered his phone) that he sounded \"kind of cheery\", possibly signalling that the Masked Man can, in fact, talk, though in an emotionless tone. The Masked Man is the final boss of Mother 3, rather than Porky Minch himself. Because of this, Porky has been the penultimate boss in both games he has appeared in. The Masked Man is in reality, Claus, who was apparently discovered near the Drago Plateau by the Pigmask Army. He was brought back to consciousness and turned into a human chimera. It is unknown whether or not he was dead when found, though the implications point more toward being dead, as the Magypsies sensed no heart in him, and it's also impossible to hear his heartbeat in battle. During this time, Porky used him as a loyal servant and gave to him near full command of the Pigmask Army. While under the control of Porky, Claus's sense of self and memories had been forgotten and pushed deep inside of him. At the end of the final battle with the Masked Man, after realizing his true identity and revealing himself as Claus, he fires an intense bolt of lightning at Lucas, purposely reflecting it off of Lucas's Franklin Badge, causing himself mortal damage and ultimately killing himself. The Masked Man has three battle themes. The first music is a variation of \"Strong One\", entitled \"Strong One (Masked Man)\". The latter songs that are heard during each portion of the final battle against the Masked Man are titled \"Battle Against the Masked Man\" and \"It is Finished\", respectively. \"It is Finished\" is an eerie, sad rendition of \"Mother 3 Love Theme\". During the moments with Hinawa speaking, the song is called \"Memory of Mother\".Unused content  Claus is the character with the most unused sprites in the game, having around 150. There is an entire set of sprites for young Claus both walking and running in a bathing suit, including one where he dives into the water and resurfaces with a gasp of air from this\u00a0unused cutscene. There are also several sprites for Claus pushing Lucas, as shown in this video, climbing, cheering, swaying from side to side, yelling, falling backward as if he was hurt, and lying on his back after the fall. This is likely due to the fact that Claus was shown to have a greater role in EarthBound 64 (a trailer of Lucas and Claus in a minecart was prominently shown), but the technological restrictions of the Game Boy Advance made this impossible to implement in Mother 3. However, his younger sprite can still be the party leader in the Debug Room and have his level increased to 99. There are also multiple unused sprites of Claus when he is older; there appears to be a sprite for him sitting, standing upright, dressed as the Masked Man and walking around, and an in-battle sprite where he still has the cannon on his right arm which can be seen using the enemy modifier code and approaching the enemy from behind. There is a notable set of Masked Man sprites where he appears to explode, a set where he is thrown backward by something, and when he is first being \"built\", possibly to be used in a cutscene at the end of either Chapter 1 or 3. The entire series of sprites can be seen animated here.In Super Smash Bros. Brawl  Claus appears in Super Smash Bros. Brawl as a sticker. Attaching this sticker to the bottom of Ness or Lucas's trophies in The Subspace Emissary increases their PK attack by 13. One of Lucas's alternate costumes also uses Claus's clothing and hair colour.Trivia Lucas  Lucas (Japanese: \u30ea\u30e5\u30ab Lucas) is the main protagonist of Mother 3 from Tazmily Village and the gentle younger twin of Claus. He is out of the seven main characters total (Lucas,\u00a0Kumatora, Duster, Boney,\u00a0Claus, Flint, and Salsa). He usually uses sticks and baseball bats as his primary weapons, along with his signature PK Love power, which grants him the ability to pull the Seven Needles to awaken the Dark Dragon sleeping underneath the Nowhere Islands.Biography  Lucas is the son of Flint and Hinawa, the grandson of Alec, and the younger twin brother of Claus. He is the youngest member of his family. He lives in Tazmily Village with his family and dog Boney. Lucas has blonde hair and black eyes, occasionally shown with a hint of teal. He usually wears a red t-shirt with yellow stripes, blue shorts, white socks and red and yellow sneakers,(sometimes orange and yellow) although this outfit is temporarily modified when he is confused with the Masked Man (who he has a strong resemblance to). He realizes his PSI powers from Ionia, one of the seven Magypsies. To learn PSI, Lucas is forced to hold his head underwater for a period of time.Personality  Until he embarks on his adventure, Lucas has a reputation for being an emotional boy, and almost the exact opposite of his twin brother, Claus. He can show determination, but only when the situation permits. Three years later, Lucas has matured into a boy much like his brother Claus, brave, determined and strong-willed.Story  Lucas is playable in the Prologue as a tutorial character. In the tutorial, Lucas learns how to dash, and is taught how to fight in a battle against the Mole Cricket. In Chapter 1, Claus, Lucas, and Hinawa fail to return to Tazmily Village from Alec's house. This causes the village to organize a search party to look for them. After Flint and Duster's fight against the Reconstructed Caribou, Claus and Lucas are found. However, Lucas is quiet, and only murmurs something about the \"forest coming to life, and taking them\". After Flint learns of Hinawa's death, he loses his grip and Claus and Lucas have their eyes covered by\u00a0Tessie\u00a0to not let them see what's happening. He attends Hinawa's funeral, where Lucas reveals that Claus went to fight the Drago that killed their mom in order to avenge her. He stays at Flint's house until the third chapter. At the end of Chapter 3, Lucas comes to assist Salsa, Kumatora, and Wess when they are cornered by Fassad. He brings Drago Jr. and his mother, apparently wanting to avenge their cyberized family member. At the start of Chapter 4, he becomes the permanent main character.PSI  Lucas is the main Assist PSI user of the party because he learns all versions of Lifeup, while Kumatora only goes up to Beta. He also learns all versions of Healing, while Kumatora only learns Alpha. He also has Refresh, which restores about 10% of the target's maximum HP each turn. His unique PSI attack is PK Love, which does anywhere from 100 to 800 damage, depending on what level of power is used. He also learns Shield, Counter, PSI Shield, PSI Counter, Offense Up, and Defense Up. In Chapter 5, he learns PK Flash. In Super Smash Bros. Brawl, however, he can use PK Fire, PK Freeze, PK Thunder, PSI Magnet, and PK Starstorm.In Super Smash Bros.  Other than being a playable character, Lucas appears in Super Smash Bros. Brawl as a playable character and a sticker with his child sprite. Attaching this sticker to the bottom of Ness or Lucas's trophies in The Subspace Emissary increases their PK attack by 13. Lucas was added into Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U as an additional DLC character and is confirmed to return in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.Trivia EarthBound  EarthBound (Japanese: MOTHER 2 \uff5e\u30ae\u30fc\u30b0\u306e\u9006\u8972\uff5e Mother 2: Gyiyg Strikes Back!), subtitled as The War Against Giygas!, is a game that was released for the the Super Nintendo Entertainment System on August 27, 1994 in Japan and on June 1, 1995 in North America. It was designed and directed by Shigesato Itoi, with music by Hiroshi Kanazu, Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu Tanaka. EarthBound chronicles the adventures of Ness, a 13-year-old boy who journeys around the world using his \"PK\" or \"PSI\" to collect eight melodies in order to save the future from an alien of pure evil, intending to sentence all of reality to the horror of eternal darkness. Despite being successful in Japan, the North American version was released to a poor commercial response. Years later, the game is now lauded by gamers worldwide for its humorous depictions of American culture and parody of the RPG video game genre, and has since become a cult classic. EarthBound was released on Nintendo's Virtual Console service for the first time on March 20, 2013 in Japan and July 18, 2013 in North America, and for the first time, Australia and Europe. A sequel to EarthBound, titled Mother 3 was released only in Japan on April 20, 2006, and has yet to see a western release.Gameplay  EarthBound features many traditional RPG elements; the player controls a party of characters who travel through the game's two dimensional world that is composed of villages, cities, and dungeons. Along the way, battles are fought against enemies, after which, the party receives experience points for victories. If enough experience points are acquired, a character's level will increase. This increases the character's attributes, like strength, defense, and health. EarthBound breaks traditional RPG features by not utilizing an overworld map. Instead, the world is entirely seamless, with no differentiation between towns and the outside world. Another non-traditional element is the perspective used for the world. The game uses oblique projection, while most 2-D RPGs use a \"top down\" view on a grid or an isometric perspective. EarthBound, unlike its predecessor EarthBound Beginnings, does not utilize random battles. When physical contact occurs between a character and an enemy, the screen switches to battle mode. In combat, characters and enemies possess a certain amount of hit points. Successive blows to an enemy reduces the amount of hit points. Once an enemy's hit points reach zero, they are defeated. In battle, the player is allowed to choose specific actions for their characters. These actions can include attacking, healing, or the use of items. Characters can also use special PSI attacks that require \"Psychic Points.\" Once each character is assigned a command, the characters and enemies perform their actions in a set order, determined by character speed. Whenever a character receives damage, the hit point box gradually \"rolls\" down, similar to an odometer. This allows players an opportunity to heal the character or win the battle before the counter hits zero, after which the character is knocked unconscious. If all characters are rendered unconscious, the game ends. Because battles are not random, tactical advantages can be gained. If the player physically contacts an enemy from behind, the player is given a first-strike priority. However, this also applies to enemies, who can also engage the party from behind. Uniquely, as Ness and his friends become stronger, battles with weaker enemies are eventually won automatically, forgoing the entire battle sequence altogether. Currency is indirectly received from Ness's father, who can also save the game's progress. Each time the party wins a battle, Ness's father deposits money in an account that can be withdrawn at ATMs. In towns, players can visit various department stores where weapons, armor, and items can be bought. Weapons and armor can be equipped to increase character strength and defense, respectively. In addition, items can be used for a number of purposes, such as healing. Towns also house several other useful facilities such as hospitals where players can be healed for a fee.Plot Characters  In EarthBound, there are four main playable characters: Ness, Paula, Jeff Andonuts and Poo. Ness remains the lead character, a silent protagonist, for the entirety of the story. He is a young boy from Onett who loves baseball, and possesses psychic abilities strong enough to affect cosmic events. He is the healer and support character of the group, as he can use Healing and Lifeup to heal effects and refill HP respectively. He also can Shield party members with Shield. For offense, Ness can use PSI Rockin, a psychokinetic move that is exclusive to him. He can also manipulate light through PSI Flash. Ness can also psychologically disrupt enemies with moves like Paralysis and Hypnosis. Ness also has the ability to teleport him and the group. His primary weapon of use are Baseball Bats. Paula is the second main party member of the game, a young girl from Twoson, where her mother runs a preschool out of their home. Like Ness, she possesses powerful psychic abilities. Paula is the first offensive character that you have available. She is able to use PSI Freeze, a strong move that does damage to a single enemy. She is also able to use PSI Fire which damages a row of enemies. Her finally offensive attack is PSI Thunder which is powerful when it hits but is difficult to land. She can absorb energy with PSI Magnet to raise her PP stat. She is able to raise her teammate's offense up or  lower the enemy's defense down. Her primary weapon of use are Frying Pans. Jeff, the third main character to join the party, is a young boy who attends a boarding school in the northern country of Winters in the region of Foggyland. The son of the famed professor Dr. Andonuts, Jeff is a child prodigy who can fix almost anything. He is the only playable character in the game that cannot use PSI. He has the unique ability to 'spy' on the enemy which reveals its stats and weaknesses and can be used for stealing items. He is the only one able to use the items that he fixed and can use bottle rockets. His primary weapon of use are Guns. Poo is the final party member. He is the oldest of the group, a residing prince from the distant land of Dalaam in the far east region of Chommo. He is presented as a powerful martial arts master. He is by-far the strongest psychic character in the game. He is able to use PSI Freeze and PSI Thunder like Paula but instead of using PSI Fire, he uses PSI Starstorm which attacks every enemy on-screen. Poo also shares PSI Magnet with Paula and Lifeup, Shield and Healing with Ness. He also has the ability to teleport as well. Poo isn't good with weapons that anyone can use like Yo-yos and Slingshots. Same can be said for gear. As a martial arts master, he uses his fist to fight. However, he can use the Sword of Kings an item that can be dropped by a Starman Super. The only downside to this is there is only a 1 in 128 chance of the enemy dropping it.Story  The story begins when Ness is awakened by a meteor that has plummeted to the earth near his home, whereupon he proceeds to investigate the crash site. When Ness gets to the crash site he discovers a police road block and Pokey Minch, his friend and neighbor, who tells him to go home. Later, Ness is woken up again by Pokey knocking at his door, demanding help to find his brother Picky. They find him near the meteor sleeping behind a tree and wake him up. Then the three encounter an insect from the meteor named Buzz Buzz who informs Ness that he is from the future where the \"universal cosmic destroyer\", Giygas, dominates the planet. Buzz Buzz senses great potential in Ness and instructs him to embark on a journey to seek out and record the melodies of eight \"sanctuaries,\" unite his own powers with the Earth's and gain the strength required to confront Giygas. After an encounter with some hostile gang members, Ness reaches the first sanctuary on a mountain above his hometown. He then proceeds to the next town, Twoson, where he rescues a girl named Paula from the Happy Happyist Cult and discovers that Pokey (who has been the high priest of cult) is working against him. Together, Ness and Paula discover the second sanctuary. With the help of the Runaway Five, a band that Ness and Paula free from debt, the two arrive in Threed, where they are ambushed and captured. While in captivity, Paula sends a telepathic message to a boy named Jeff, who resides at a boarding school. Jeff responds to the message and acquires his father's Sky Runner, a flying vehicle, in order to reach Threed. After crashing the Sky Runner, Jeff rescues Ness and Paula and joins their group. The three of them travel to Saturn Valley, a land populated by a strange race of creatures called Mr. Saturns. There, the party learns that a monster has been kidnapping the populace. Ness and the group proceed to defeat the monster and reach the third sanctuary above Saturn Valley. The party then travels through the desert to reach the next city. Upon reaching Fourside, the group again helps the Runaway Five out of debt and visits a department store only to have Paula kidnapped. Ness and Jeff proceed to find her, and along the way, destroy a hallucination-projecting relic called the Evil Mani Mani statue. The two boys continue their search only to discover that Pokey and the Mayor have taken Paula. However, because Ness and Jeff defeated the Evil Mani Mani statue, the mayor returns to normal. Pokey escapes in the Mayor's helicopter and Paula rejoins the group. After returning to Threed, Jeff repairs the Sky Runner, and they set flight for Winters to discover the fourth sanctuary. The group then crosses the ocean and arrive in Summers where Ness falls unconscious and dreams of a far-off land known as Dalaam. There, a young prince named Poo has completed his training and is instructed to join the party on their journey. The group then returns to Fourside and are able to discover the fifth sanctuary. The four then procure a boat and travel to Scaraba where they explore a pyramid in the desert. Ness and the group then travel to Dalaam and find the sixth sanctuary there, after which they acquire a submarine and travel into the Deep Darkness, a path leading them under the earth. There, they find Tenda Village, a small community populated by extremely shy creatures. After acquiring the book of overcoming shyness, Ness is able to speak to the shy villagers who allow them passage to the Lost Underworld. There, they discover the last two sanctuaries. Upon activating the final sanctuary, Ness falls unconscious and enters a strange world composed of his dreams, Magicant. There, he encounters his nightmare. After defeating it, Magicant vanishes, and Ness becomes much stronger because he has conquered Giygas's influence over him. After awakening, Ness and the group return to Saturn Valley where Jeff's father, Dr. Andonuts, has finished the Phase Distorter, a time traveling device. Dr. Andonuts explains the kids that the machine cannot warp them to the past in their current form since life cannot withstand the warp through time. In other words, time travel would likely destroy their human bodies. To remedy this problem, Dr. Andonuts proposes to them to have their souls transplanted into robotic bodies, warning them that he doesn't know whether or not the process is reversible. Despite this critical warning, Ness, Paula, Jeff and Poo are willing to take the risk. Now in the form of robots, Ness and his friends use the Phase Distorter to travel to the past where they encounter Pokey and Giygas, who, in order to contain his massive power, has been sealed inside the Devil's Machine. Pokey informs the group that Giygas became so powerful that his mind was completely destroyed, referring to him as an \"all-mighty idiot\". The group defeat Pokey, who then shuts off the Devil's Machine and releases Giygas, trapping the kids in a chaotic dimension composed of his own indefinable being. Since Giygas is too powerful for Ness and his friends to overcome by fighting, Paula begins to pray, reaching out to the inhabitants of the Earth, including family members and friends, who all pray for their safety, and eventually, she reaches out to the player. The combined prayers of both Earth's inhabitants and the player reach Giygas and exploit his weakness, which turns out to be human emotions. As a result, Giygas vanishes from existence. with all the damage he had done to Eagleland and the rest of the Earth erased from history, the souls of Ness and his friends depart from their robot bodies, travel back to the present and return to their respective bodies. After bidding each other farewell, the heroes return to their homes. After the ending credits, Picky Minch comes to Ness's house in the middle of the night and gives him a letter from Pokey that says \"Come and get me loser. Spankety, spankety, spankety!\", and the game ends with him and Ness pondering what has become of him.Development  Development on EarthBound took place as a joint effort between Ape, Inc. and HAL Laboratory, Inc. and was designed by Shigesato Itoi. The total development time for the project was five years, much longer than was initially expected. Of this, Itoi has stated that many times he felt the project was \"doomed\". Because two companies were working on EarthBound, responsibilities were spread out between the two studios. Ape had more people working on the title and oversaw the data aspects of the game while HAL worked on the programming. Because the two studios were based at separate locations, employees would regularly have to travel between the studios to work. Initial gameplay features that Itoi had in mind involved an unconventional level structure and hit points system. Itoi decided to exclude an overworld, because he wanted no distinction to remain between towns and the outside world. This resulted in each town being carefully designed to be unique. The first design concepts for the hit point boxes were to make them like pachinko balls and have them fall off the screen whenever a character was damaged. However, this was later changed to the \"rolling counter\" hit point boxes because the pachinko balls did not work so well when characters had large amounts of hit points. EarthBound is also host to a unique kind of copy protection. When played, the game continually checks the legitimacy of its cartridge. If it is determined to be an unauthorized duplicate, it begins spawning enemies at an unusually higher rate than normal. If the player is able to overcome this challenge and reaches the game's final encounter, Giygas, the game would freeze in the middle of the battle, at which point all saved games are permanently deleted. Some of the difficulties posed by the development of EarthBound were the data restrictions imposed by the Super Nintendo Entertainment System cartridge size. It was initially designed to fit on an 8 megabit cartridge. However, it was later pushed to 12 megabits and then finally pushed onto a 24 megabit cartridge. This can partially be attributed to the large amount of music composed for the title. Other aspects of the project that remained difficult were programming concepts. The oblique projection techniques proved difficult to program and were time consuming as well. The bicycle and delivery man systems posed problems as well due to their own complex programming schemes. Some aspects of the character designs remain very personal for Shigesato Itoi. In an interview on his website, Itoi describes how his inspiration for the final battle with Giygas resulted from a \"traumatic\" childhood event. When Itoi was a very little boy, he accidentally viewed the wrong movie at a theater, a Shint\u014dh\u014d film entitled The Military Policeman and the Dismembered Beauty. According to Itoi the film featured a graphic rape scene near a river that traumatized Itoi so much that his parents began to worry about his well-being. Years later, Itoi integrated the experience into Giygas's dialogue for the final battle. Nintendo eventually announced a release date of August 27, 1994 for Japan, and invested a large amount of money into promoting the new game. Other efforts included bundling a full length strategy guide with the game, complete in a bigger box, and affixing a price much lower than other titles at the time. Scratch and sniff stickers also came bundled with the game. EarthBound was released in Japan on August 27, 1994, and was well received. The North American version was released almost a year later on June 1, 1995, and was met with lukewarm responses. A sequel was announced three years later for the Nintendo 64DD, entitled EarthBound 64 or Mother 3. However, the game became plagued by problems as release date pushbacks occurred, as well as failures to appear at popular gaming conventions, like E3. Nintendo eventually announced its cancellation on August 21, 2000. Years later, Mother 3 resurfaced as a Game Boy Advance title and was released only in Japan. On May 5, 2005, Shigesato Itoi announced that he had no plans to develop the Mother series any further. After the development of the Wii system, it was expected that EarthBound will be released for the Virtual Console, but due to supposed copyright issues involving music sampling, and Nintendo of Japan's refusal to let the game be modified, it was stated that EarthBound would never be re-released outside of Japan. However, during the Nintendo Direct show on April 17, 2013, Nintendo announced that EarthBound would be re-released for the Wii U's Virtual Console in America and Europe in 2013. The Japanese version was already re-released in March of the same year. On July 18, 2013, EarthBound was suddenly released on the Wii U Virtual Console for $9.99. As of August 2013, Earthbound is 1# on the VC in most of Europe and is 2nd place in America, behind Donkey Kong.Music  EarthBound's soundtrack, Mother 2: Gyiyg Strikes Back, was released on compact disc and cassette tape by Sony Records on November 2, 1994. It consists of twenty-four tracks, three of which are remixes. Some songs from EarthBound appear in Super Smash Bros. Melee and Super Smash Bros. Brawl in their original or remixed form. Development of the music for EarthBound remained much easier than its predecessor. In an interview with Weekly Famitsu, Keiichi Suzuki commented on how the Super Nintendo Entertainment System gave the composers much more freedom to compose what they wanted. Suzuki also cited John Lennon as an influential figure to all the composers while the soundtrack was being developed. EarthBound is controversially known for its heavy use of sampling popular music, a factor which has prevented it from being re-released. Throughout the game, a distinct UFO-like sound effect can be heard in many themes, most noticeably at the start of Otherworldly Foe. The noise can be heard in places such as nighttime Onett and inside caverns. The sound also appears in Mother 3, most noticably in the room of the Empire Porky Building following the Hall of Memories. Coincidentally, the theme is the \"Nighttime Onett\" theme from one of the earliest segments of the game.Reception  EarthBound became a great success in Japan, eventually rising to #1 on Weekly Famitsu's top 30 chart along with hearty recommendations by the magazine reviewers. Commercial reactions in America, on the other hand, were much lower than Nintendo had anticipated. American audiences were largely indifferent to Japanese RPGs and would remain this way until titles like Final Fantasy VII took the genre into the mainstream. Years later, many American critics have praised the game for being ahead of its time, as well as for its storyline, graphics, and particularly, its humor. In the June 2008 issue of Nintendo Power, EarthBound was revealed to be the #1 \"Readers' Most Wanted\" Virtual Console title, with EarthBound Beginnings close behind at #2.Reviews  Reviews of EarthBound have generally been positive. In Allgame's review, EarthBound was declared \"one of the most original role-playing games of the 1990s.\" The site then went on to praise its storyline, humor, and characters. A point of contention between critics were the simplistic graphics. In All RPG's review of the game, the graphics were described as \"horrid,\" while Nintendojo and 1UP enjoyed them, with 1UP going so far as to say \"regardless of what anyone tells you, the graphics are awesome.\" 1UP also criticized the title's similarities to Dragon Quest, but in the end declared EarthBound a game \"worth experiencing.\" Nintendojo and Gamasutra also criticized the similarities to Dragon Quest, with Gamasutra declaring EarthBound an \"unabashed Dragon Quest clone...\" Despite the criticism, Gamasutra regarded the title as \"as one of the greatest RPGs on the SNES.\" The game's audio was also praised, with All RPG declaring it \"some of the best music on the Super Nintendo.\" Of all EarthBound's elements, however, the most lauded was its humor, being universally praised by all critics for its comedic, albeit confusing, depictions of American culture and parody of the RPG genre.Legacy  EarthBound is regarded by critics as one of the greatest RPGs on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, as well as one of the best of the 1990s. The game has also become a cult classic and possesses substantial fanbases in both Japan and North America. As a result, the game regularly appears on readers' choice polls in both countries. In a 2005 readers' choice poll of the top 99 best games of all time conducted by IGN, EarthBound was voted 46th on the list. A year later, IGN conducted a similar readers' choice poll where EarthBound moved up to be 33rd on the list. The game has also appeared on lists conducted by the Japanese. In a 2006 readers' poll conducted by Famitsu magazine, the game was voted the 37th best game of all time on a list of 100 titles. In an introspective of the 20 essential Japanese RPGs, Gamasutra featured EarthBound on the list.Super Smash Bros. series  EarthBound is one of the many Nintendo franchises featured extensively in the Super Smash Bros. series, having playable characters, stages, music tracks, trophies, and stickers representing the series.Super Smash Bros.  Ness appears as an unlockable character in the first Super Smash Bros. game on the Nintendo 64, marking his first appearance in 3D, although he and Captain Falcon are the only characters that appear without having a stage from their respective games. To unlock Ness, you had to beat Classic in Normal difficulty without dying once.Super Smash Bros. Melee  Ness appears again in Super Smash Bros. Melee, this time as a starting character in the roster. Onett and Fourside appear as stages, and nine trophies from EarthBound appear, Ness, a Mr. Saturn, a Starman, a UFO, Jeff Andonuts, Paula, Poo, and two other trophies of Ness's special moves in the game.Super Smash Bros. Brawl  Ness again appears as an unlockable character in Super Smash Bros. Brawl. The Mother franchise also gets another playable fighter joining the fray in the form of Lucas from Mother 3, appearing as a starter character. Lucas' appearance in the game marks not only his first 3D appearance, but his first appearance outside of Japan as well. The Onett stage from Melee reappears as a Classic Stage, joined by New Pork City as a new stage and the largest stage in the game. The stage features the Ultimate Chimera, capable of instant KO's to players who run into it. The six EarthBound-based trophies that appear are Ness, his Final Smash of PK Starstorm, Franklin Badge, Mr. Saturn, Jeff, and Porky (despite using his Mother 3 appearance). The eight EarthBound-based stickers used are Ness and his party, Mr. Saturn, Starman, Master Belch, and Porky (using his EarthBound appearance).Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U  Ness again was an unlockable character in the same style as Brawl. Onett from Melee reappears in this game on the Wii U and Magicant appears in the 3DS Version. Lucas doesn't appear in this game at the start but appears as downloadable content. The Franklin Badge and Mr. Saturn returns as items.Fan works  Since gaining a large cult following, EarthBound's fanbase has created a variety of work, ranging from fanmade games to drawings. EarthBound's soundtrack has also been completely remixed by fans and released as a free downloadable tribute album entitled Bound Together. The album encompasses 48 tracks and includes performances from well known video game cover bands, such as the OneUps, as well as various artists from remixing communities like OverClocked ReMix.Trivia Ninten  Ninten (\u30cb\u30f3\u30c6\u30f3, Ninten) is the main protagonist of EarthBound Beginnings. He is a boy from the suburbs of Podunk, the older brother of Minnie and Mimmie, the son of Carol and her unnamed husband, and the great-grandson of George and Maria. He usually uses common-place items such as baseball bats\u00a0as his primary weapon, along with boomerangs and slingshots. Ninten is the only character in the EarthBound series to suffer from asthma during battle. This is similar to Ness's homesick status effect in that it is unique to their characters only.\u00a0Appearance  Ninten is stated in the encyclopedia to be 152 cm (5ft 0in) tall and weighing 42 kg (93 lbs). He wears a red baseball cap with a blue bill turned to his left, and sticking out of it is his short black hair. He has black eyes, which on his clay model resemble the style of eyes drawn on 1920s-1930s cartoon characters. He wears a blue t-shirt with thin yellow stripes, tucked under blue shorts on only one side. His socks are red, and he wears blue shoes.Biography  Ninten lives in a small house north of Podunk with his Mother and Father (although the latter is rarely at home, and does not appear in-game until the epilogue), and his two twin sisters. Ninten's adventure begins when a poltergeist causes some objects in his home to become animate and violent. After Ninten routs the poltergeist by defeating a possessed baby doll, he begins to investigate the origin of these strange phenomena, which have begun occurring across the countryside. The cause of these events is later revealed to be a group of alien invaders led by\u00a0Giygas. Like most protagonists of early Nintendo games, Ninten is generally a silent character, having no speaking roles beyond \"yes\" or \"no\" responses, with the exception of a brief few lines of dialogue at the end of the game. Ninten's personal weapon type is baseball bats, and his PSI abilities are primarily supportive and restorative in nature. As the game progresses, Ana develops feelings for Ninten, which culminates in a scene in which the two dance in a cottage on Mt. Itoi, where the player may choose whether or not he reciprocates. In EarthBound Beginnings and Mother 1 + 2, it is implied that the two maintain a relationship after the events of the game as the final cutscenes show Ana receiving a letter from Ninten. Ninten is the only character in the series to be asthmatic. When his asthma is acting up, he is unable to take action in combat, somewhat similar to Ness's homesickness. Ninten's exclusive ability is 4th-D Slip, which can be used to flee from any escapable combat engagement with guaranteed success. Ninten's favorite food is Prime Ribs, and his favorite animal is the penguin.PSI Abilities  Throughout Mother, Ninten can learn a variety of different Assist- and Recover-type PSI abilities. Among the Assist abilities are 4th-D Slip , DefenseDown, DefenseUp, Hypnosis, OffenseUp,\u00a0PowerShield, PSI Shield and QuickUp. Among the Other abilities are Telepathy and Teleport. Finally, among the Recover abilities are Healing and\u00a0LifeUp. Ninten is the only Mother series protagonist that doesn't know any offensive PSI. However, it is interesting to note that in the commercial for the original Mother, Ninten and Ana are seen working together to cast the offensive\u00a0PK Beam to destroy a robot resembling one of the R\u20227030 series; a slight departure from Ninten's in-game PSI arsenal.In the Super Smash Bros. Series  Ninten appears in Super Smash Bros. Brawl as a sticker. Attaching this sticker to the bottom of Ness or Lucas's trophies in The Subspace Emissary increases their PK attack by 24. It is possible that Ninten may have also been considered briefly for Brawl, but he never made it past the planning stages. In Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS, he appears in the background of Magicant stage\u00a0with his friends. Unlike his counterparts Ness and Lucas, Ninten has yet to appear as a playable character in the Super Smash Bros. series.Etymology  Ninten's name is derived from the name Nintendo (only without the \"do\"), the company that published and developed the Mother series. The name 'Ninten' was used by Nintendo as a placeholder name in guides and suchlike for many games in the 1990's. Among the other generic titles the characters received in the instruction manual, Ninten himself was referred to as 'Boku', Japanese for \"Me\", in order to leave his name entirely up to the player. Screenshots and player's guides used \"Ninten\" as the main character's name, and it has since been adopted as his official name. In the Japanese Mother novel adaptation, however, he was called Ken.Trivia Kumatora  Kumatora (\u30af\u30de\u30c8\u30e9) is one of the main characters in Mother 3. She is the only playable character and permanent member of Lucas' party who is female. She can use many powerful PSI abilities. She is a tomboy, in contrast with previous games' female party members (Paula and Ana) who were stereotypically feminine characters. This is most likely due to her being raised by the extremely feminine Ionia, a Magypsy. Kumatora is called the princess of Osohe Castle, although she doesn't actually have any royal blood. In fact, Kumatora was only named princess by the Magypsies after they were asked to care for her by the people on board the White Ship.Personality  True to her tomboyish nature, Kumatora is tough, to the point where she refuses to cry until the game's ending (this could be a reference to a sentence in MOTHER's commercial, saying in Japanese, \"There's no crying until the end.\") She is also rude, calling Wess by the term, \"old geezer\", quickly commenting on Duster's bad breath and calling Fassad a \"cheap bastard\". She can also be rather impulsive - while trapped in Osohe Castle, she seriously considers cutting off her leg while it was caught in a bear trap and\u00a0took the Egg of Light before Wess could warn her about the traps attached to it. However, during rough situations, Kumatora does prove to be nice and caring in regards to the rest of the party, and also to others- as she went on to help Salsa escape from Fassad's abuse. She also has a resourceful streak, using her waitress disguise to remain undercover after the Pigmasks take over Nowhere Islands (though she expresses a firm distaste for them).Appearance  Kumatora is portrayed as a teenager but can be slightly older. She is a hot pink haired girl with a tough yet somewhat feminine appearence, wearing a turquoise full sleeved hoodie with baby blue collars and wrists, which reaches slightly above her knees like a short dress would. She wears cherry-red boots and has her hair styled in pixie cut which has a spiked back and front side bang. She is shown to wear winged eyeliner and magenta lipstick in her clay figure. During her in-game appearance, she is shown to have a pendant and ribbon equipped, which she apparently wears- unless the player changes it. During her disguise as a waitress, she wears her hair in a girlish manner, tied with a golden band. She also wears a white and pink dress, which she reveals to hate. She wears white shoes and violet eyeshadow. Her height also increases after the time skip.Story  Kumatora was a young infant when she arrived at Nowhere Island in the White Ship, having no parents to take care of her, the Magypsies decided to take care of her, which resulted in Kumatora gaining the knowledge of various PSI moves. She was decided to be made the Princess of the Osohe Castle, although, in haste, not much backstory was provided for her. Kumatora first appears in Chapter 2; while Duster makes his way through Osohe Castle in search of the Noble Spitoon, she drops from a ceiling, landing and dashing through the nearby door. She drops her pendant in the process, which Duster takes. Kumatora is seen again when Duster later returns with Wess; as they enter a room, they find her with her leg caught in a bear trap. She fires a blast of PK Freeze at them, but suddenly recognizes Wess and apologizes, instead musing on whether or not to cut her leg off somehow. Wess and Duster free her and return her pendant, and she joins them out of gratitude, at which point the player can name her. The trio continues through the castle and eventually find the Egg of Light; unfortunately, the Pigmasks pursue them and attempt to barge into the room, prompting her to grab the egg and tripping a trapdoor that sends them plummeting into the room below. Upon meeting and defeating the Oh-So-Snake, a drain opens (later revealed to be pulled by Salsa in Chapter 3), and all three of them are sucked out. Wess and Kumatora end up on a shore in Tazmily Village and are nursed back to health at Lighter and Fuel's house. They head out to the town square in search of Duster and the Egg of Light, who are both nowhere to be found, and discover that Butch and the other villagers suspect him of stealing a bag of money from the well; the bag of money was given to Butch (and revealed to be stolen from him) by Fassad. As Wess and Kumatora defend Duster's reputation (with Kumatora threatening to beat the snot out of Butch), Fassad shows up and takes advantages of the situation by using Salsa to sell Happy Boxes to the villagers. As he tries to sell one to Kumatora, she reads Salsa's mind and senses his plight, promising to rescue him. Kumatora and Wess later free Salsa from his bonds, and are forced to escape with him from Fassad and a group of Pigmask Soldiers. They run into Sunshine Forest, where she and the others are forced to fight off a Pork Tank. Despite defeating the colossal machine, Kumatora's group ends up surrounded by Pigmasks, but they are bailed out in the nick of time by Lucas and a duo of Dragos (one adult and the baby), who drive off the Pigmasks for the time being, ending Chapter 3. Three years later, Kumatora is revealed to have become a waitress at Club Titiboo, where she goes by the name of Violet (Yoshikoshi in the Japanese version). \u00a0After Duster (who goes by the name 'Lucky' at that point) joins the party, Kumatora joins the party as well, as they go out to search for the Egg of Light. At this point, she goes out and beats up the guards of the Club- once again showing her feisty nature. At this point, Chapter 4 ends. With start of Chapter 5, Kumatora, along with the rest the party members, continue the search for Egg of Light- after finding which, they head over to Thunder Tower- and realize the reason for the erratic lightning across Tazmily Village, they go on the shut off the tower, which, after they are successful in, end in a cutscene where they encounter Fassad. He mocks them and attempts to leave via a helicopter- while leaving the team on the crumbling tower, but slips on the banana peel he threw, falling off the tower. The team then clings onto the helicopter's ladder using Rope Snake and flies off a distance, until The Masked Man notices them and\u00a0attempts to shake them off by shaking the helicopter. He succeeds and the team ends up falling in different places, ending Chapter 5. Kumatora has no appearance in Chapter 6. Kumatora is found in Doria's house later during Chapter 7, who saved her after she fell, and joins the team later on. The rest of Chapter 7 is spent finding the Needles, and Kumatora remains in the party at all times. Near the end, after defeating Masked Man for the first time and pulling the Needle, Ionia teaches Kumatora PK Starstorm, one of the strongest attacks in the game. In Chapter 8, Kumatora, along with the party members, explores the New Pork city- but as a silent party member. Until the pulling off the last Needle, she doesn't have any extra role to play. After the game ends, she is notably crying in the secret ending, as said by one of the characters.In Battle  Kumatora primarily uses\u00a0Gloves\u00a0as weapons.\u00a0Compared to other members of the party, Kumatora's normal attacks are weaker. However, Kumatora can use many powerful PSI attacks as\u00a0her stats are designed to support her role as the party's main PK user; she can use PK Fire, PK Freeze, PK Thunder, PK Starstorm, and PK Ground. She also learns Healing, Lifeup, and PSI Magnet, and Assist PSI like Offense Down, Defense Down, Brainshock, Hypnosis, and Paralysis.In Super Smash Bros. Super Smash Bros. Brawl  Kumatora appears in Super Smash Bros. Brawl as a sticker. Attaching this sticker to Ness or Lucas's trophies in The Subspace Emissary increases their PK attack by 11.Super Smash Bros. Ultimate  Kumatora appears with Boney when Lucas uses PK Starstorm, his final smash. She also appears as an attack type advanced level primary spirit in the new Spirits mode. Her spirit has two support slots.Trivia EarthBound Beginnings  EarthBound Beginnings (Japanese: \u30de\u30b6\u30fc Mother) is the first installment in the Mother series. It was developed by Ape Inc., Nintendo Tokyo R&D Products, and Pax Softnica, and was published by Nintendo for the Famicom on July 27, 1989. For its Japanese release, the game was known by the title, \"Mother\". It was designed and directed by Shigesato Itoi and produced by Shigeru Miyamoto, with music by Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu Tanaka. In 1990, EarthBound Beginnings was fully translated by Nintendo of America and slated for a 1991 release outside of Japan as \"EARTH BOUND\". However, due to marketing issues and the approaching release of the SNES, the game was not released in other territories. It took many more years for the game to be released overseas. In Japan, the game was re-released on the Game Boy Advance in a compilation with its sequel, Mother 2 (\"EarthBound\") as Mother 1 + 2. June 14, 2015, 25 years after being released in Japan, Earthbound Beginnings was released in North America and Europe for the first time on the Wii U Virtual Console. Itoi stated that the reason for the release was because of the fanbase's dedication. EarthBound Beginnings is a release of the original, unreleased NES translation, and contains all of its changes from the original releases, a trait shared with Mother 1 + 2.Gameplay\u00a0  EarthBound Beginnings' gameplay is divided into two main parts: the overworld and the game's battle system. EarthBound Beginnings does not use a small-scale overworld map and instead connects towns, dungeons, and other places together with large outdoor areas. When in towns on the field map players can talk with non-player characters, go to stores to buy equipment or items, rest in hotels, or enter other various buildings. By using any telephone in the game, Ninten, the protagonist, can talk to his dad, who deposits money into Ninten's bank account and offers to save his progress. When outside of towns on the field map or while inside dungeons, the party will encounter enemies in random battles. There are a handful of exceptions wherein the party can be attacked while in the sanctuary of a town, examples being the zombies masquerading as townsfolk in Podunk, the enemy infested streets of downtown Spookane, and the B.B. Gang members in Ellay. When in battle, the game switches to a first-person view, only showing the enemies and a menu system used to issue commands. Actions are chosen for each character by the player, and the characters and enemies will take turns performing the actions in an order determined by their speed statistics. Winning battles awards experience points, which characters require to level up. Leveling up increases a character's stats and lets them learn more abilities. If a character loses all of their hit points, they will become \"unconscious\" and the player must go to a hospital and pay to revive them.\u00a0After a full-party defeat, Ninten is revived at the last location at which the player saved but with 0 PP (Psychic Points).Plot Characters and Setting  EarthBound Beginnings tells the story of Ninten, a 12-year-old boy from Podunk, who journeys around America using his psychic powers to collect eight melodies in order to save the planet from an evil race of mind-controlling aliens. Along the way he is joined by four friends; a brilliant-minded young boy\u00a0tormented at his school for being a weakling, a PSI-powered girl whose mother mysteriously went missing, a gang leader whose parents were murdered, and a young but powerful tomboy girl who he rescues from a cemetery. They meet many unusual characters and visit strange settings before ultimately confronting the leader of the aliens, Giegue. On his journey, Ninten visits many towns and locations such as Merrysville, Spookane, and Ellay to name just a few. He also visits the mysterious land of Magicant and must scale Mt. Itoi to his final battle.Story  EarthBound Beginnings is a mostly non-linear game and not all the possible events or characters must be encountered to complete the game, nor do they need to be encountered in the order described below. This summary is of the intended sequence of events but is not representative of every players' experience. Also note that there are several story differences between the 1989 Famicom release and the 1990 English translation, which is used as the basis of all re-releases of the game. The extended ending, arguably the game's largest story modification, is noted in this section; all other plot alterations are listed in \"Censorship and Localization.\" For the sake of following Nintendo of America's official stance on the MOTHER trilogy, the 1990 version of the game's plot is described here. In the early 1900's, a dark shadow covered a small country town in rural America. George and Maria, a young couple, mysteriously vanished, having been abducted by aliens. While in captivity, George and Maria raised Giegue, an alien infant, as if he were their own child. While Maria raised Giegue like how a mother would raise her son, George illicitly studied the aliens' PSI powers, suddenly returning to Earth two years later. He refused to tell anyone where he had been or what he had done but resumed his odd studies by himself. Maria, however, never returned. The aliens, angry at George's theft of their knowledge, order Giegue to reclaim it from Earth and ensure it is not used against them by humans. Although Giegue is distraught at having to attack his family, he reluctantly follows through... Eighty years later, in the rural American town of Podunk lives a 12-year-old boy named Ninten, with his mother and two sisters, Mimmie and Minnie. His story begins when his home is seemingly attacked by a poltergeist, who possesses two Lamps and a Doll. After the objects are defeated, Ninten's father calls him, explaining that George, now revealed to be Ninten's great-grandfather, studied PSI. Ninten's father then tasks him with investigating a series of strange phenomena occurring across America, leaving Ninten to go out on his own. After returning a canary chick to its mother and rescuing & befriending a 7-year-old girl named Pippi from the local cemetery, Ninten is sent to investigate the escaping and sudden hostility of the animals in the local zoo. There, he discovers the phenomena are the work of an invading alien race. Ninten is then warped to the world of Magicant, where the land's ruler, Queen Mary, has recently started to experience horrible nightmares. When she meets Ninten, she asks him to find her song, the Eight Melodies, and play them to her, as she has forgotten the song and desperately needs to remember it. After returning to his world, Ninten visits an elementary school in Merrysville and meets an 11-year-old boy named Lloyd, who is constantly bullied for being a weakling. Ninten befriends Lloyd and joins Ninten on his adventure to find the Eight Melodies. The two then travel to the town of Snowman to deliver a lost hat to an 11-year-old girl with PSI powers named Ana, who tells Ninten that she saw him in a dream and joins the party in hopes of finding her missing mother. The group then continues their investigations in Youngtown, where all but two of the adults were abducted by a U.F.O. Having learned this, they decide to continue onward and further investigate these coinciding phenomena. After finding five to six of the melodies (three of which Ninten found in Podunk, prior to his first visit to Magicant), Ninten, Ana, and Lloyd wind up in the city of Ellay, where they learn that strange, black clouds have appeared over Mt. Itoi. However, during the trio's investigations, they are harassed by members of the Bla Bla Gang, a powerful street gang who attacks anyone that provokes them. After overcoming these thugs, the trio performs karaoke at the Live House. However, their performance is interrupted by the Bla Bla Gang's leader, who is angered by the fact that the trio was beating up his lackeys. The leader then challenges Ninten to a duel, only to quickly realize how powerful of an opponent Ninten is. Swearing defeat, the leader introduces himself as Teddy and explains that his parents were killed by wild animals on Mt. Itoi. Seeking vengeance, he joins Ninten's party, replacing Lloyd, who rests up at the live house. Teddy then instructs the group to climb the mountain and avenge his parents. The trio then treks up the mountain, facing numerous formidable foes along their way. Eventually, they rest at a cabin, the only place where they can currently find safety. There, Ana leads Ninten into a quiet room, where the two dance and confess their love for each other. However, Teddy interrupts them, pointing out strange noises coming from outside. When they look out the window to investigate, they are immediately attacked by R7038, an upgraded version of a similar robot encountered earlier on in the game. R7038 brutally devastates the trio, but Lloyd suddenly appears in a tank borrowed from a war veteran in the Yucca Desert. He destroys the robot with a single shot from the cannon, but is slightly off-mark and hits his friends as well. Lloyd then transports the trio back to the cottage, where Teddy is critically damaged from the fight. Teddy realizes that one cannot win all battles simply using brute force, and stays in the cottage to heal. Lloyd then rejoins the party in Teddy's stead. Continuing their trek up Mt. Itoi, the trio is sucked into a whirlpool while trying to cross a lake in the center of the mountain path. The whirlpool brings the trio to George's abandoned underground laboratory, where they find a large robot named EVE. EVE explains that she was built with the purpose of protecting Ninten in his time of need, and joins the trio on their adventure. The glass windows in the lab then give way, flooding the lab and whisking the party back to dry land. The quartet then continues their trek, learning that EVE is so powerful that she can kill enemies in a single blow. However, she is soon challenged by R7038XX, an upgraded variation of R7038. R7038XX and EVE then duel on the mountain, R7038XX gaining the upper hand. However, as a last resort, EVE self-destructs, destroying R7038XX in the process. The remaining trio then finds a chip in EVE that plays the seventh of the Eight Melodies. They continue up the mountain until they reach a cliff near the peak, where they find a cave barricaded by several immovable rocks. Along with the cave, they find George's gravesite, where his spirit contacts Ninten and relays to him the final melody. Ninten and co. then head back to Magicant, where they relay the full song back to Queen Mary. Not only does Mary remember the song, but she also remembers that her true identity is Maria, George's wife and Giegue's former caretaker from 80 years ago. She explains that she sang the Eight Melodies to Giegue as a lullaby and that she and Giegue loved each other very much, akin to a mother and her son. Realizing her true identity, Maria passes on, as Magicant slowly dissipates; it was only a figment of Maria's imagination... When Ninten, Ana, and Lloyd return to the real world, they find that the rocks blocking the cavern are gone, allowing them to enter. Inside, they find a room filled with alien pods containing numerous adults, many of whom were abducted from Youngtown. One adult recognizes Ana from her hat and explains that her mother is being held in a room in the back. However, it is also explained that it is impossible to free anyone without defeating Giegue first. With this in mind, the trio then continues through the cavern and reaches the summit. There, Giegue appears in his mothership and attacks the trio, explaining his backstory all the while, and expresses his gratitude for Ninten's family, as Maria raised Giegue when he was but a child. While he initially reprimands Ninten for obstructing his plans, Giegue offers to spare Ninten's life, should he board the mothership with him. However, Ninten refuses, and an angered Giegue then attacks the trio further, stating that they can \"fall into a long sleep with the rest of the ugly Earth people\". When the trio tries to fight back with force, they are unable to defeat him, no matter how much they attack. However, upon checking the alien, Teddy's realization from before comes into place: Maria's spirit explains that Giegue cannot be defeated with brute force, and can only be defeated by the singing of the Eight Melodies. With this in mind, the trio repeatedly tries to sing the Eight Melodies, yet are attacked by Giegue, who hopes to silence him to escape his old conflictions. However, after ten failed attempts, one member of the trio (determined by the player's actions during the battle) manages to sing the entire lullaby. Unable to bear the pain of the memories induced by the melodies, Giegue is defeated, and flies back to the cosmos, swearing that he will have his revenge. In the original Famicom release, the game abruptly ends at this uncertain point: Ninten and co. will face the screen as the credits roll behind them. However, the 1990 English localization (and, by extension, all re-releases of the game) significantly extends the game's ending, with the assumption that the player followed the plot as described above. After Giegue's defeat, the adults in the cavern are freed and brought back to their families in Youngtown, while Ana reunites with her mother and returns to Snowman. The group then parts ways, and each member continues with their own life. Lloyd is given a hero's welcome back in Merrysville and is no longer bullied by his peers. Teddy, now fully recovered, changes his ways and becomes a live performer at the Live House in Ellay. In Snowman, Ana receives a letter from Ninten and eagerly hopes to meet him again. Back in Podunk, Ninten is greeted by his family, who infer that Ninten must be famished after his long journey. Now that the earth's crisis is finally over, Ninten decides to lay down and go to sleep. This extended ending finishes off with a cast of all the characters who appeared in person\u00a0in the game (minus Giegue, standard enemies, and bosses), a new credits sequence, and a post-credits scene: Ninten's father tries to call Ninten, apparently with urgent news, implying that a new problem needing investigation has arisen...Development  EarthBound Beginnings was designed and directed by famed Japanese copywriter and television personality Shigesato Itoi. The game's original release was named after John Lennon's song \"Mother\", which moved Itoi so much that he wanted other people to be moved in the same way. Itoi could heavily relate to the song, which dealt with Lennon's experiences growing up without either of his parents; Itoi's own father was absent for much of his life. Because of this, he chose to isolate the role of Ninten's father as simply a voice on a telephone, a role that would be inherited by Ness's father in EarthBound. Itoi also felt that \"MOTHER\" was a fitting title for the game, as it was noticeably more \"feminine\" than most RPGs. A proposal for the game was initially presented to Shigeru Miyamoto, who rejected it due to the commercial failure of other celebrity-produced Famicom games. Itoi was so upset that he cried on the train ride home. However, he later received a callback from Miyamoto, thereby commencing development. Shigesato Itoi, the game's designer, has said that the last parts of EarthBound Beginnings were not tested for bugs and balance issues due to time constraints. When talking about this at a Mother 1 + 2 promotional event, Itoi humorously stated, \"When we got to fine-tuning the difficulty there [Mt. Itoi], I was like, 'Whatever!'\" The game was released in Japan again on June 20, 2003, as part of the Game Boy Advance compilation Mother 1 + 2. Nintendo published Mother 1 + 2 with the intention of advertising the upcoming Mother 3. It retained the censorship of the unreleased translation and other changes, such as the names of towns.English release  Before the release of the game twenty five years later, Nintendo of America had originally planned to translate and release Mother in the United States under the title Earth Bound. The localization was completed in 1990, but marketing pushed the release into fall of 1991, and it was eventually cancelled. The Localization Producer and English Script Writer for Earth Bound, Phil Sandhop, explained, \"Once the Super NES squatted in the pipeline and shoved the game aside from its appointed time, I believe that the marketing execs just decided that the game would be too expensive to produce and unsuccessful without marketing, and that's why it fell into oblivion.\" However, the project's failure was not in vain. In response to the extensive changes made to MOTHER, Nintendo began making more of their games with an international audience in mind; often, a game would be pre-localized even after its Japanese release before being sent to Nintendo's overseas studios. In 1998, the fan translation group Demiforce found a beta cartridge of the game on eBay and organized an effort to collect enough money to buy the game. The project was a success, and soon after, the game was dumped into a ROM and circulated around the internet. Due to a glitch with the most accurate emulator of the time, Demiforce hacked the game while also appending \"Zero\" onto the title to retroactively discern it from its sequel, EarthBound. This hack ran in NESticle, but also triggered a new anti-piracy message at two key points in the game; the game was since further hacked to prevent such issues. Since Demiforce had built its reputation on releasing their English translations out of the blue, some fans debated whether the cartridge had been translated by Nintendo or by Demiforce themselves. However, today it is generally agreed that the cartridge is legitimate, as Mother 1 + 2 and\u00a0EarthBound Beginnings contain all of the changes found in the beta cartridge. During 2007, Tomato, better known within the Mother series fan community for his involvement with The Unofficial Mother 3 Fan Translation, began work on a remake which used the graphic engine of its successor, EarthBound. This made the game's maps complicated to work on, and on August 6, 2008, Tomato said of the development's progress, \"I already made most of the necessary tools, and as you can see, I had all of the enemies, the entire script, all the items [...] But the problem is the maps, and without a reliable map editor, it's just not gonna happen.\" His resources were then designated to providing an alternate translation, which he recently released as part of Mother 1 + 2. Nearly 26 years after being released in Japan, Mother was released in the United States and Europe as EarthBound Beginnings on June 14, 2015. It is fully translated into English, using the same ROM as the unreleased NES prototype and the Mother 1 + 2 release.Music  EarthBound Beginnings' soundtrack was composed by Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu Tanaka. The music was released on compact disc and cassette tape by Sony Records on August 21, 1989. It consists of eleven tracks, seven of which have vocals. Some of the game's notable songs include \"Eight Melodies\", which plays a heavy role in the story, and \"Pollyanna\". Both have lyrical versions on the album, sung by St. Paul's Cathedral Choir and Catherine Warwick, respectively. On February 18, 2004, the soundtrack was re-released with digitally remastered tracks. Songs from EarthBound Beginnings appear in EarthBound, Mother 3, Super Smash Bros. Melee and Super Smash Bros. Brawl in their original or remixed form.Censorship and Localization  During the localization from the Japanese Mother to the English EarthBound Beginnings, many names and graphics were changed, as well as features added. Shigesato Itoi was heavily involved with this localization and many if not all of the changes were approved by him. Most changes are to reduce difficulty, adhere to the strict censorship policies that Nintendo of America enforced from 1985 to 1994, and make the game more accessible for English speakers.Reception  EarthBound Beginnings was successful in Japan, selling approximately 400,000 copies. In two polls conducted by Famitsu, it was rated as the 9th best game on the Famicom and the 38th best game of all time. The game was the listed as the fourth most-wanted Virtual Console release in the first month of a poll by Nintendo Power. It is currently residing in the number two spot, behind EarthBound. In a Mother 1 + 2 review, Netjak praised the modern setting and broad themes, calling the game, \"quite dark and mature.\" Jeremy Parish from 1UP.com states, \"the game balance is completely ridiculous, relying far too heavily on picking up better weapons and grinding for far too long.\"External links Unused Boss (Mother 3)  The unused boss character in Mother 3 is a source of major speculation within the Mother community. It may have been intended to be used in a darker version of the final battle, and is speculated by some to be a representation of how Lucas sees Claus throughout the battle. A creepy breathing sound has been noticed by hackers, along with what was possibly the boss's battle music and screaming.Accessing the battles  In order to battle the unused enemies, in the cheat code menu of emulators such as VisualBoyAdvance, 020047EC must be entered in the address bar and one of its enemy modifier codes must be entered in the value bar. The codes must be put in with 8-bit size and the number format on \"Hexadecimal\". These codes vary between its numerous forms. They are CB (its standard form, called Dung Beetle), CC (its yellow angel form, called Tent Person), CD (naked Claus, called Snow Bunny), CE (Claus clothed, called Clayman), F1 (Same as Clayman, but with a different background transition, called Sign), CF (an undulating red X, called Vapor), D1 (close-up of adolescent Claus, called Rope Snake), D2 (Kid Claus made of pixels, called Aeolia's Table), D3 (close-up of adolescent Claus outlined in red, called Straw), D4 (a face almost alike the Facepunch Studios logo without any facial parts but eyes, nose and mouth, called Vapor 2), D5 (Same as Vapor 2 but without a nose, called Mini Elevator), F0 (Lucas and Claus, called Train) and F2 (naked and albino Claus resembling Giygas, also called Sign). While this code is active, the player must encounter an enemy. Instead of beginning a battle with the expected enemy, the battle with the unused boss will immediately begin.Forms  The unused boss projects itself as Lucas's worst nightmare \u2013 a deformed, robotic version of his twin brother Claus. During the battle, it changes into several different forms. Aside from its standard form, these are a yellow angel, Claus naked (and again later with the pallet of its normal form), Claus clothed, both Lucas and Claus, a large, screaming Claus with no pupils or irises (and again later as a red outline), and a head resembling that of Claus' which lacks all features except eyes a nose and a mouth.Abilities  The unused boss' abilities vary between forms. Of note is a PSI ability that was likely scrapped during the development of Mother 3, which is simply called \"PK\u00a0?\" (blank line). Its nature is similar to PSI Flash, as it targets all of the boss' opponents and causes adverse effects including poison and nausea. There are certain forms of the boss which have no abilities (such as Straw) and are thus unable to inflict damage on the party members. Various other forms of the boss possess different levels of this unused PK attack; Snow Bunny, for instance, uses only PK \u03a9 (Hypnosis \u03a9), which puts all party members to sleep. Dung Beetle uses PK \u03b2, which poisons all party members. Tent Person uses PK \u03b3, which causes paralysis to all party members.Stats  Many of the boss's earlier (as listed above) forms share the same stat sets, while later forms have much weaker stats. Slightly more detailed information on the stats can be found on the List of unused and glitch enemies in Mother 3 page.Drops Trivia External links References PSI  PSI (Psionics) or PK (Psychokinesis) refers to the psychic powers that appear throughout the Mother series. The numerous PSI-wielding allies and enemies throughout the series each have their own array of PSI powers that they are able to draw from. As characters level up, they will gain access to successively stronger variants of their PSI moves. The power level of a given PSI move is designated by a Greek letter; in ascending order of power, the tiers are Alpha (\u03b1), Beta (\u03b2), Gamma (\u03b3), Pi (\u03c0) or\u00a0Sigma (\u03a3), and Omega (\u03a9). PSI abilities can be compartmentalized into four different categories: Giygas's species and their allies are known to be proficient at PSI, and George is stated to have been studying the power some decades prior to the events of Mother. In EarthBound, various enemy types\u2014humans, animals, aliens, and even inanimate objects\u2014are able to use PSI, potentially as a result of Giygas's influence. Additionally, the Dalaamese seem to have developed the ability to tap into PSI on their own. In Mother 3, the use of PSI abilities is generally limited to the Magypsies and their students, with rare exception. While the Magypsies have apparently been using it for centuries, it is worth noting that Mother 3 is implied to take place far into the future from the first two games in the series. The effects of some PSI moves differ from game to game, and their description in a given section will cover what they do in that specific game.PSI abilities in EarthBound Beginnings PSI abilities in EarthBound PSI abilities in Mother 3 Unused dummy PSI in Mother 3  These can only be used by the Unused Boss. Double-spaces are present between \"PK\" and the ability's rank, potentially as a result of formatting codes used when printing the names onscreen, or to accommodate for proper names for the abilities that were never implemented.Trivia Paula  Paula Jones (Japanese: \u30dd\u30fc\u30e9\u30fb\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30f3\u30ba Paula Jones) is one of the playable characters in EarthBound. She is the first to join Ness, and the only female member of Ness's team. She usually uses frying pans as her primary weapon, along with many powerful PSI powers. Her HP and defense are rather low, but she has high PP and is the fastest of the playable characters. She has a Pray ability, which calls forth one of many possible random effects in battle. There are several characters in the game that believe Ness and Paula are dating; from Ness's Mother to Jeff Andonuts, the latter says so at the end of the game.Biography  Paula is a resident of Twoson in the country of Eagleland, and the daughter of the owners of the local Polestar Preschool, when she joins the adventure. Ness is made aware of her existence when he goes to sleep at any location after visiting the \"Your Sanctuary\" location at Giant Step, when she contacts him through her telepathy in a dream. She was kidnapped by a masked boy and Pokey Minch, and brought to Peaceful Rest Valley to become the high priestess for Happy Happyism (although Everdred claims she was kidnapped to be a human sacrifice). She gifts the Franklin Badge to Ness so he may challenge and defeat Carpainter, get the key to where she is imprisoned, and free her. After she is freed, she joins Ness's party. She is later kidnapped by Geldegarde Monotoli, but as before, Ness rescues her, this time with the help of Jeff. Paula's Pray command is ultimately a key part of the game, as she must use it nine times to defeat Giygas in the final battle.Personality  Paula is portrayed as a kind, fairly weak and cutesy girl in the original release, to the point where she states she almost cried when she was locked up. However, Marcus Lindblom had stated that he revised Paula's character during localization to be a more forceful, capable and \"willing to destroy\" character.In Super Smash Bros. Brawl  Paula appears in Super Smash Bros. Brawl as a sticker. Attaching this sticker to the bottom of Ness or Lucas's trophies in The Subspace Emissary increases their PK attack by 10.In Super Smash Bros. Ultimate  Paula appears with Poo when Ness uses PK Starstorm.Trivia Characters  This category is for all characters in the Mother series.Poo  Poo (\u30d7\u30fc P\u016b) is a playable character in EarthBound. He is the third and final playable character to join Ness. Poo has a wide variety of offensive and defensive PSI, along with being decent at attack and defense, and has a noticeable resistance to PSI Fire and PSI Freeze. His drawback is that he can only equip items from the \"of Kings\" set (the Diadem of Kings, the Cloak of Kings, the Sword of Kings and the Bracer of Kings). Poo cannot use any weapons except his fists, the yo-yos, slingshots (both of which lower his attack) and a weapon exclusive to his use, the Sword of Kings. He has a unique ability called mirror, which allows him to become any enemy in the game during battles, with the notable exception of bosses. Poo undergoes a special diet, meaning that he can't eat any Western-style foods and recovers few hit points or psychic points from ingesting such items. However, he can drink bottles of water to recover much more psychic points than other characters would, and Eastern foods more effectively restore his HP than they do for any other character.Biography  As the Crown Prince of Dalaam, he has undergone strict martial arts training. Poo is first introduced after Ness eats the Magic Cake, and he completes his training by meditation, which he maintains despite a spirit breaking various parts of his body. Poo then teleports to Summers and declares his allegiance to Ness. Poo is taken from the party after they come up from the exit of the Pyramid in Scaraba by the Star Master, who shows him the powerful PSI Starstorm \u03b1, which he uses to defeat Master Barf. Poo is a solemn dedicated warrior, but is loyal to his friends and bringing peace to the world. Interestingly enough, Poo is very popular with the girls in Dalaam.In the Super Smash Bros. Series In Super Smash Bros. Melee  Poo appears as a trophy in Super Smash Bros. Melee, with the text Poo, the crown prince of the mysterious eastern country of Dalaam, joined Ness after completing rigorous training in his home country. While he doesn't stand out among Ness's friends, his vast experience and strong willpower make him a key to their success. Poo can assume the form of an enemy to gain its powers.In Super Smash Bros. Brawl  Poo appears in Super Smash Bros. Brawl as a sticker. Attaching this sticker to the bottom of Ness or Lucas's trophies in The Subspace Emissary increases their PK attack by 9.In Super Smash Bros. Ultimate  Poo appears with Paula when Ness uses PK Starstorm.Trivia Jeff Andonuts  Jeff Andonuts (\u30b8\u30a7\u30d5 Jefu) is one of the playable characters in EarthBound, the second to join Ness. Jeff is the only permanent party member who is unable to use PSI abilities. To compensate for that, he can repair broken objects to turn into useful machines and weapons for battle, although what exactly he can repair is based on his IQ level and the broken items he has in his inventory. He usually uses Guns as his primary weapons, along with bottle rockets and the aforementioned repaired gadgets such as the Hungry HP-Sucker, Heavy Bazooka, Neutralizer, and Shield Killer. He also has the Spy ability, allowing him to look up enemy attributes and snatch away their drop item if they have one.Biography  Jeff is the genius son of the great scientist Dr. Andonuts, and attends the Snow Wood Boarding School in Winters, FoggyLand. Paula communicates with him telepathically to rescue them from captivity in Threed. After acquiring the Sky Runner from his father, Jeff travels to Threed and rescues Ness and Paula, securing his place as one of the chosen four.In Super Smash Bros. Brawl  Jeff appears in Super Smash Bros. Brawl as a sticker based off his clay model, with the distinct change of his outfit's color and that he is looking up. Attaching this sticker to the bottom of Ness or Lucas's trophies in The Subspace Emissary increases their PK attack by 24. He also appears as an Assist Trophy, launching bottle rockets at his opponents.Trivia PK Love  PK Love\u00a0is a PSI ability in Mother 3 that works on all enemies. Aeolia notes in passing that she taught Claus a super-powerful PSI technique, and Ionia, who helps Lucas realize how to use PSI techniques, is impressed at his ability to use PK Love, as even the Magypsies are unable to master it. At its \u03a9 level, its power is rivaled only by PK Starstorm, PSI Rockin, and (to an extent) PK Freeze \u03a9. PK Love is learned in Mother 3 by only Lucas and Claus. Like Ness's PSI Rockin ability from EarthBound, PK Love can be given a unique name by the player, when asked what the player's favorite thing is before the story begins. Also, \"Love\" is one of the default names for PSI Rockin. The Magypsies cannot wield this ability, as it is used to pull the Needles they are guarding and awaken the Dark Dragon under the Nowhere Islands as an out-of-battle effect. In battle, it appears as harsh, shining pink and turquoise lights with a hexagonal pattern (with the exception of the \u03b1 stage).Trivia Mr. Saturn  The Mr. Saturn (\u3069\u305b\u3044\u3055\u3093 Dosei-san) are a species in EarthBound and Mother 3 and serve as the unofficial mascot for the trilogy. They are strange, possibly extra-terrestrial life forms who reside in both Eagleland's Saturn Valley and the Nowhere Islands's Saturn Valley in EarthBound and Mother 3, respectively. They are characterized by huge noses, four whiskers, and a single hair with a small red bow. They are generally very peaceful and generous, offering free coffee and stays at the hotel. They speak Saturnian (composed of odd-looking English letters), and in the English translation erratically use the words \"boing\", \"ding\" and \"zoom\" at the ends of their sentences. The Japanese font is said to be inspired by the handwriting of the young daughter of EarthBound's designer, Shigesato Itoi. Of Mr. Saturn, Itoi has stated that the race is the symbol of innocence in EarthBound. The Mr. Saturns are often said to have no gender, although a Mr. Saturn in Saturn Valley's cave in Mother 3 exclaims \"Girl. I am girl.\" Their village has round homes which resemble flying saucers and strange furniture, such as Automatic Teller Machines which bounce up and down in place and resemble Mr. Saturn. Some of the Mr. Saturns' preferred foods are \"peanut cheese bars\" and \"piggy jelly\", goods that can be purchased in the Saturn Valley shop.Biography EarthBound  The Mr. Saturns play a major story role in EarthBound. Nearly all of the Mr. Saturn live in Saturn Valley beyond Grapefruit Falls (though there is one living back in Happy Happy Village and another in Onett). When Ness, Paula and Jeff first arrive in Saturn Valley, several are missing. They provide information relating to Master Belch and his Fly Honey factory. Ness and his friends get into the factory to find that Belch has enslaved some of the Mr. Saturn, forcing them to make fly honey for him. When Belch is defeated and the Mr. Saturn are freed, Ness and friends gain access to the upper part of Saturn Valley and the Your Sanctuary location Milky Well, then they can proceed to Fourside. Later in the game, Dr. Andonuts, Apple Kid, and the Mr. Saturn design the Phase Distorter in Saturn Valley to enable Ness and company to travel through time back to the past, in order to confront Giygas. They are the first to pray for the chosen four during the final boss fight.Mother 3  The Mr. Saturns have a much smaller story role in Mother 3. Again, the Mr. Saturns live in a place called Saturn Valley, which is located nearby one of the Highway exits. They are initially captured by the Pigmask Army, so that the Mr. Saturns would confess the location of the fourth Needle. Lucas and co. rescue them from the Pigmask Army and their Frightbots, and in return they tell him where to find the Needle. After the party defeats New Fassad and Lucas lifts the fourth Needle, they return to Saturn Valley, only to find that a Pigmask has blocked off the exit. Lucas and friends escape the valley when, with the help of Rope Snake, who sees this as an opportunity to redeem himself, they grab hold of a cage of captured birds. A Mr. Saturn later gives Lucas a polished Courage Badge, which is actually a Franklin Badge. Dr. Andonuts and the Mr. Saturns are also responsible for designing the Absolutely Safe Capsule to be used by Pokey Minch in times of desperation. It is unknown how they manage to have such mechanical skills despite their lack of arms.Super Smash Bros. series Item  In Super Smash Bros. Melee, Super Smash Bros. Brawl and Super Smash Bros. for Wii U and 3DS, Mr. Saturn appears as an item. After spawning or being released from a container, it sits in place for a few seconds, then walks around. It is often seen as a \"joke item\", in that it has no special use aside from being thrown at an enemy character for a few points of damage. It can also be damaged by attacks which sends it flying. The Mr. Saturn can also be caught in mid-throw and tossed back at opponents. Though commonly overlooked, there is one thing Mr. Saturn is good for, which is breaking shields. In Super Smash Bros. Brawl, its description in the Item Switch is simply, \"Pwaaaaah. Pwaaaaah,\" and it is categorized as a throwing item.Sticker  In Super Smash Bros. Brawl, there are two Mr. Saturn stickers. One is fairly large, featuring his clay model from EarthBound, and the other is his sprite in Mother 3. Attaching the former to any character's trophy base will make the character always spawn holding a Mr. Saturn in The Subspace Emissary, while the latter will increase the power of Ness and Lucas's PK moves by 7.Trophy Quotes Super Smash Bros. Melee  \"The origins of the Mr. Saturn race are unknown. But many believe that they come from outer space. They are found in Saturn Valley and speak their own unique language. In Super Smash Bros. Melee, Mr. Saturn is just another item with which to pelt foes. These guys are laid back and not into fighting, so you can rest easy... or can you?\"Super Smash Bros. Brawl  \"A creature from a race of unknown origin that speaks its own unique language. Some say they came from outer space, but the facts behind their appearance are wrapped in mystery. In Smash Bros., they'll wait a bit after appearing before wandering off on their own. They can be picked up and thrown at foes for minimal damage. Their shield-breaking properties are high.\"Other  When Lucas is arriving in a battle in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, he rides onto the field on the Mr. Saturn's walking coffee table. Ness also has an alternate costume featuring a white Mr. Saturn sprite on a solid black t-shirt. It's very similar to the Good Kid's Shirt, an equippable item that is found in Saturn Valley in Mother 3.Trivia Ultimate Chimera  The Ultimate Chimera is an enemy in Mother 3. It is a battery-powered Chimera which takes on a hideous appearance due to being created from the DNA of numerous different species, making it one of the very few chimeras that were created from more than two such species; however, the specific animals used to create it are never revealed. It is first encountered in the Chimera Laboratory.Description  The Ultimate Chimera is a red beast with tiny, indigo, bat-like wings, a pointed tail, horns (or pointed, cat-like ears), and slightly reptilian characteristics. Its most notable feature is its gigantic mouth, which stretches across much of the length of its body and is lined with huge, sharp teeth. It has a tiny bird on its back whose function is apparently to reactivate it.Appearances  The Ultimate Chimera was created by Dr. Andonuts in the Chimera Laboratory to be the ultimate killing machine, but it went rogue before he could destroy its last weakness, an off-button on its back.First Encounter  After Lucas and friends defeat the rogue Almost-Mecha Lion with the help of a Clayman, the laboratory is thrust into red alert: scientists have been overwhelmed by the Ultimate Chimera, which was among the chimeras that Salsa and Samba released, and is now free to roam the corridors unbound. It can appear in any room of the laboratory, and can also use the elevator. If it catches the party, they will be automatically defeated, evidently ranking it as one of the most threatening creatures in Mother 3, and the strongest 'enemy' in the game. Despite this, its movements are relatively simplistic; if it notices Lucas and co., it will move in a straight line towards them to the point where it will continue to bump into an obstacle between the two parties rather than go around it. At one point, the Chimera corners Lucas and his dog, Boney. Dr. Andonuts, hiding in a garbage can, tells Lucas to offer Boney as bait so he can press the power button, but Lucas refuses. Just as it dives at Lucas, Salsa, who remembered how Lucas saved him in the Sunshine Forest with the aid of the Dragos, jumps onto it and presses the button himself, deactivating the monster. After the Chimera is deactivated, Boney gets angry at Dr. Andonuts, who claims the bait suggestion was just a joke, and runs off with a barking Boney in pursuit. However, after all the other characters leave the hallway, the bird on its head simply pushes the button to revive it after everyone had left.Second Encounter  It is encountered again in the Restroom Level of the Empire Porky Building in New Pork City, where it is guarding the Awesome Ring. To get the ring, Lucas has to enter the bathroom stall housing the monster, then quickly leave before it bites. If Lucas and co. then wait in the stall connecting to the next room, the Chimera will then bust down the door to its stall and walk around the room, giving the party an opportunity to run in and grab the Awesome Ring without being caught. In theory, it IS possible to run around the Ultimate Chimera and open the present before being caught, but this results in being defeated immediately after grabbing the ring, and generally requires heavy abuse of emulation save states to accomplish.Super Smash Bros. Brawl  The Ultimate Chimera appears in Super Smash Bros. Brawl on the New Pork City stage, where it appears and disappears at random times. Like in Mother 3, it wanders aimlessly and attacks the player when they are too close; however, if it spawns on a platform that a character is already on, it will not attack them until they leave the platform. Its bite deals 100% to 200% damage and massive knockback; the attack is designed to be an \"instant kill\" as it is in the Mother series, although the unfortunate character may survive if they bounce off enough walls, or ukemi them. If the Ultimate Chimera is on the destructable platform at the bottom of the stage, the player has the opportunity to temporarily \"defeat\" it by smashing the platform with the Ultimate Chimera on it. It then will roar loudly as it plummets out of sight, though it will eventually respawn.Duster  Duster (\u30c0\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc Dasut\u0101) is a character in Mother 3.\u00a0A thief who sets out on adventures of his own\u00a0first introduced in Chapter 1, he later becomes a main character in Chapter 2. Duster joins Lucas at the end of Chapter 4 after being in the DCMC for three years as their bassist (where he was called Lucky); it is also shown that he learned to play the double bass cello after being picked up by DCMC after the event in Chapter 3 when Duster \"goes missing\" from Kumatora and Wess for three years. He is separated at the end of Chapter 5, and returns permanently during Chapter 7, though in the final battle he is somewhat useless due to the fact that the Masked Man uses a move that K.O.s the entire team except for Lucas. He usually uses shoes as his primary weapon, along with a number of Thief Tools that weaken or distract foes. While having a leg that he is always seen to limp with, Duster continues to have excellent speed. Not only is he the second-fastest party member after Boney, but he can sometimes \"Attack with blinding speed!\" to attack the enemy before the start of the battle or jump behind an enemy, which flips the entire party behind the enemy and gives the party a turn to attack before the enemy can. He can also unleash a reverse kick on an enemy that has attacked the party from behind before the enemy takes their turn.\u00a0Wess alludes to an incident in his past in which he blames himself for paralyzing Duster's left leg. The limp is recognizable regardless of what he is wearing, such as when he is in the guise of a Pigmask. However, he has no difficulty running, kicking, and moving on staircases, so his leg might not be completely immobile. Due to the way he holds his hip to give his leg extra support, he may just be paralyzed from the ankle down, which would make it awkward for Duster to walk but not reduce the effectiveness of kicking with the leg in mention with a good shoe on.In Super Smash Bros. Super Smash Bros. Brawl  Duster appears in Super Smash Bros. Brawl as a sticker. Attaching this sticker to the bottom of Ness or Lucas's trophies in The Subspace Emissary increases the power of their leg-based attacks by four.Super Smash Bros. Ultimate  Duster appears as a primary spirit in the new Spirits mode. He is an attack type, novice spirit with one support slot.Trivia Starmen  The Starmen are a race of beings in EarthBound Beginnings and EarthBound. They are extraterrestrial beings, and are among the original users of PSI. Starmen are common among the higher ranks of Giygas's army.Appearances EarthBound Beginnings  George, one of two humans abducted from Earth by an alien race in 1909, studies PSI without the race's permission, and later escapes back to Earth. Once matured, the alien Giygas is tasked by his people to ensure PSI never spreads onto Earth, and commands a number of sentient beings, including the Starmen, to carry out this order.EarthBound  Ninten and his friends triumph over Giygas' defeat, and he and the Starmen recede back into space, only to come back and enslave the world sometime in the future, draping it in \"infinite darkness\". One alien survivor, Buzz Buzz, rides ten years into the past on a meteorite, in order to contact another chosen boy, Ness. However, a Starman Junior is revealed to have followed Buzz Buzz back to Ness' time, and a battle ensues, after which the Starman falls. The Starman and Starman Super can be found all over the Stonehenge Base, along with Atomic Power Robots and their apparent head, the Starman Deluxe. Other variants, including the Ghost of Starman and Final Starman, appear in Onett and the Cave of the Past. While they do not appear in Mother 3, the Pigmask Army plays a similar role as a group of enemies aiding the game's antagonist.Species  It is unknown if Starmen are organic or synthetic, or if their outward appearance is just a suit; the American EarthBound player's guide implies in their enemy descriptions that Starmen are robots. Their speech in EarthBound also reflects this; in Mother 2, Starmen use the katakana script, which is a common way to denote robotic-sounding speech. The English version, lacking this, gives them \"whirrs\", \"beeps\" and \"clicks\", to indicate they are robotic beings. However, they may be organic, as the Rust Promoter, which is supposed to damage mechanical enemies, is useless against Starmen of any kind. Same goes for PK Beam \u03b3 in EarthBound Beginnings, as it doesn't affect mechanical enemies, yet can damage any Starman, save for the Starman Junior. Also, an enemy called \"Ghost of Starman\" is encountered towards the end of EarthBound, but if the Starmen are robots, they wouldn't be able to become a ghost. The description of the Ghost of Starman in the EarthBound player's guide refers to it as an alien. They may also be connected via a sort of \"hivemind\"; when the Starman Deluxe is defeated, any Starmen summoned during the battle are defeated as well, and the Stonehenge Base becomes devoid of enemies. Starmens' arms and legs do not seem to move, so Starmen instead appear to move around by means of teleportation (though this type is different from PSI Teleport). This can be seen when Ness approaches a Starman in EarthBound, as they will then teleport directly behind him and occasionally trigger a surprise attack in their favor. It can also be seen in Super Smash Bros., where, once activated, the Starman assist trophy teleports randomly around the arena while firing electric bolts. The members of the Starmen 'species' are listed as follows: According to the official EarthBound Player's Guide, Atomic Power Robots are early prototypes to the Starman series.Battle Music In Super Smash Bros. Brawl  The Starmen species are represented by the Starman enemy, who appears in Super Smash Bros. Brawl as a sticker. Attaching this sticker to the bottom of Ness or Lucas's trophies in The Subspace Emissary increases their PK attack by 10.In Super Smash Bros. Wii U and 3DS  In the mode, Smash Run, in Super Smash Bros. for 3DS, Starmen occasionally appear as enemies. They primarily stand in their signature pose and shoot small beams at players that temporarily stun them. They also teleport around the opponent to avoid being attacked. Though when hit by a strong move, they appear to fall over, staying in their pose. If unattacked while knocked down, they will eventually hop back up and continue attacking players. Starmen also appear in both versions, though in the Assist Trophies in standard smash modes. Here they act identically to their Smash Run counterparts, except that they only attack opponents of their summoners.Trivia PSI Rockin  PSI Rockin (PK \u30ad\u30a2\u30a4 PK Kiai, lit. PK Fighting Spirit), sometimes referred to as PK Rockin, is a PSI ability in EarthBound and is Ness's signature move. Ness's Nightmare and Giygas (before Pokey turns off the Devil's Machine) are also capable of using PSI Rockin. It deals damage to all enemies and has the possibility of decreasing one of the targets' Psychic Shield strength by 1. When used in battle, it displays a series of psychedelic lights and sounds, and inflicts high damage on all enemies based on the level of PSI Rockin used. At its Omega (\u03a9) level, its power is rivaled only by PSI Starstorm \u03a9, and (to an extent) PSI Freeze \u03a9. It cannot be used out of battle. Like the four main characters, King, and Ness' favorite food, the player can give a unique name to PSI Rockin before the story begins by entering their \"favorite thing.\"  The Virtual Console re-release of\u00a0EarthBound\u00a0alters the animations of PSI Rockin by significantly blurring them. This is done to reduce the risk of epileptic seizures, a standard precaution in re-releases of older Nintendo games.\u00a0Trivia Fassad  Fassad (also known as \u30e8\u30af\u30d0 Yokuba), previously known as\u00a0Locria before joining the Pigmask Army, is a recurring antagonist in Mother 3. In his life as Locria, one of the seven Magypsies, he once guarded the final needle that needed to be pulled in order to awaken the Dark Dragon. Unknown as to where Locria was, according to Ionia and the other Magypsies, they seem to never hear from Locria or feel his presence. The reason behind this is his betrayal of the Magypsies when he joined the Pigmask Army, where he became one of the top commanders.\u00a0Duties and a Life as a Pigmask Commander  Fassad is first seen in Chapter 1, making a rather small cameo. After Flint is released from jail, the player can go to Butch's farm, and see Fassad making a deal with Butch to buy his pigs from him. He later bumps into Duster in Chapter 2 while on the way to steal the money he gave to Butch as part of their deal. Fassad takes a larger role in Chapter 3, appearing in Death Desert along with Salsa the monkey. He is there under the orders of the Pigmask Army to sell Happy Boxes to the people of Tazmily Village. Fassad constantly tortures Salsa with the shock collar around his neck for failing at his tasks, and even for succeeding at them. After making Salsa hand-deliver Happy Boxes to four people, he goes to Osohe Castle to see what all the commotion is about. Discovering that the Egg of Light was was taken by Duster, Wess and Kumatora, Fassad chases after the party, and commands Salsa to pull a lever that, instead of getting him closer to the party, ends up saving them. He reappears later at Thunder Tower after the Pork Trooper reveals that Lucas isn't really the Masked Man. Fassad, along with some other Pigmasks, chases the party to the top of the tower. After walking about while talking to the party, his habit of carelessly discarding the peels of his Luxury Bananas leads to his downfall, when he slips over a tossed banana peel and tumbles from Thunder Tower's summit. Although it seems that he is dead, this is disproved when the party is about to pull the fourth needle at Fire Mountain, and Fassad and his Interpreter appear. Fassad needs his Interpreter because, after the Pigmask Army resurrected him as a cyborg, he had horns implanted where his mouth was. The party defeats him and he retreats. He returns for the last time in the sewers of New Pork City as Miracle Fassad, with even more horns (including two that function similar to his jetpack as New Fassad). After being defeated, he goes on to say that he is sick of fighting, and that this is all just Porky's game. Shortly afterwards he explodes and he falls into the sewers, never to rise again. His fate may have been the same as the other Magypsies since he was meant to guard the final needle. His Interpreter then tells Lucas and co. not to follow it since it is not needed anymore, and flies away; the Interpreter cannot be found again. Since his memento (the Razor and Lipstick) can be obtained in Locria's Level before the pulling of Locria's Needle, unlike the other Magypsies, it is implied that he vanished after his second defeat, which would make Fassad the only Magypsy to not disappear after the pulling of their Needle.Special Attacks as a Party Member  Fassad has his own arsenal of attacks at his disposal. Although he is not a playable character, he is a powerful party member. Since Salsa is at level 1 in Chapter 3 when he is first playable, his attacks are significantly weaker than those of Fassad, leaving him to effectively pull the party's combined weight. Fassad can use a standard attack, bum rush foes for at least moderate damage, and rarely throw bombs that deal massive damage. If Salsa has any status ailments, he will cure them by activating the Punishizer, which restores Salsa to normal at the cost of 1 HP. On occasion, Fassad will waste his turn by performing various (and often comedic) actions; some of the more cowardly ones are borrowed from Pokey's first appearance in EarthBound. The full list includes:As an Enemy (New/Miracle Fassad)  After his preservation as a mechanical chimera, Fassad battles Lucas and co. on two occasions in the game. In both battles, his abilities are largely the same: he can charge a single party member, attack three at once with an off-key music attack, or throw a whole bunch of bombs at everyone. He can also emit a dazzling light to make everyone cry, and he can even emit an intense light that causes one party member to faint instantly. He can use an awful smell, Forgetfulness Gas, and flea bombs to inflict nausea, forgetfulness, and fleas, respectively. He can defend himself with a Shield device, and he can scarf down a Luxury Banana to heal 500-600 HP (far more than Lucas and co. can heal from the same item). He smiles boldly on occasion. He becomes vulnerable to salt watergun after his makeover, however. As Miracle Fassad, some of his horns will break off after he loses a significant amount of HP, reverting him to his New Fassad sprite. When this happens, his heart fills with hatred, and he reveals his true power: a deadly array of PSI attacks, including PK Freeze \u03a9, PK Thunder \u03a9, Brainshock \u03a9, Offense Down \u03a9, PSI Shield \u03b1 and Defense Up \u03b1. But his most dangerous attack by far is the rare and destructive PK Starstorm. Fassad has two different sets of Battle Sounds for each battle. As New Fassad, he uses Battle Sound 53, which falls under Code Numbers 918 for regular attack, 919 for Smaaaash! and 920 for Miss. As Miracle Fassad, he uses Battle Sound 31, which falls under Code Numbers 852 for regular attack, 853 for Smaaaash! and 854 for Miss.Secret identity as the lost Magypsy, Locria  Although it is never explicitly stated, the game contains substantial evidence proving beyond reasonable doubt that Fassad is the lost Magypsy, Locria. The earliest example is in Fire Mountain, where the newly rebuilt cyborg ambushes Lucas and friends; the trumpets that sound in place of his own voice play a distorted version of the background music heard in the Magypsies' homes. Later, when he is fought in the New Pork City sewers as the even further redesigned \"Miracle Fassad\", he uses PSI abilities (including the elusive PK Starstorm) which, in the age of Mother 3, are generally limited to use by Magypsies and their disciples. When Lucas and his party reach Leder in New Pork City, he states that Locria had betrayed the Magypsies and joined the Pigmask Army. Fassad would fit under this description, as he does affiliate with them and is of high authority to the army. The biggest cache of evidence is found in Locria's house, which is on one of the highest floors of the Empire Porky Building in New Pork City. The house contains a turban and vest worn by Fassad, numerous crates of Luxury Bananas, and a pair of New Fassad's horns. On the same floor is a lone mouse counting on Locria to return to the house, as it was apparently taken care of by Locria. The mouse also reinforces Fassad's identity as a Magypsy by attesting that Locria had a distinct \"Nwehehehehe\" laugh and that he was hardly seen as a good person by most. Fassad's status as a Magypsy was eventually confirmed by Shigesato Itoi.Trivia Ness's Nightmare  Ness' Nightmare is a boss in EarthBound. It is encountered during Ness' venture in the Sea of Eden within Magicant, and is the manifestation of the evil in Ness' mind. As such, when Ness' Nightmare is defeated, Ness destroys all of the evil, fears, and doubts that were within him, allowing him to absorb the true power of the eight \"Your\" Sanctuary locations. The field sprite for Ness' Nightmare is identical to that of Evil Mani-Mani, though the relationship between the two, if any, is uncertain. It is possible that Ness' mind chose the Mani-Mani Statue as a known symbol of evil. It is also possible that the trait of the Mani-Mani Statue bringing out the evil in people may have influenced Ness' inner turmoils to conjoin into the form of the Mani-Mani Statue.  During the battle, as the manifestation of Ness' evil (essentially a part of Ness), the Nightmare's attacks are all the same PSI attacks Ness can use; this includes various levels of PSI Rockin, PSI Flash (via a glorious light), PSI Lifeup, and Shield \u03b2.Trivia ", "Crimsontale Wiki": "Crimsontale Wiki ", "Prisma, Undertale A.U Wiki": "Prisma, Undertale A.U Wiki ", "To the Edge of the Sky Wiki": "To the Edge of the Sky Wiki ", "Infinity Wars Wiki": "Infinity Wars Wiki ", "EverWing Wiki": "EverWing Wiki ", "Peggle Wiki": "Peggle Wiki The Peggle Institute  The Peggle Institute is the place where all the the Peggle Masters live, as well as where all of the levels are played.

Jimmy pops up in the corner of your screen saying various phrases like \"Awesome\",\"Dudical\", \u00a0\"Insane\" and others, when you get a good Combo of Pegs.Power  Jimmy's power is Multiball, which spawns a second ball upon hitting of the green peg.

Also, in Peggle Blast, the balls are actually nuts.Special Style Points Multiball Madness  (25,000 pts) - Hitting the green peg before hitting the last orange peg.

He is the master of Peggle since his name is \"Master\" (Hu), and he has the best ability in the game.Appearance  to be addedZen Ball  His special power is Zen Ball, which optimizes and fires an alternative and better shot to the one you would have fired. This is useful when making a difficult move, as it will often end up being better than what any player could have done. It is theorized that the ball will also gravitate towards higher valued pegs after being shot and seems to aim at the Bucket more frequently, but this remains to be found out via testing.Zen Madness  (25,000 pts) - Hitting both Green Pegs in one turn.Levels Peggle Tips Trivia Renfield  Have you ever felt true fear? Do you understand what it's like to not be able to sleep at night? To have your entire world turned upside down, to not comprehend absolute chaos?

All he cares about is turning your version of reality into the spookiest, most ominous-green-glowing hellish nightmare he possibly can. Appearance He has bright-green stem, yellow eyes,orange skinSpooky Ball  Renfield's power is Spooky Ball which makes the ball spookily reappear on the top of the screen when it drops below the Bucket line.Levels Peggle Peggle Nights Tips  to be addedTrivia Marina  Marina is a Peggle Master first introduced in Peggle Nights, her power-up is Electrobolt, and her levels in Peggle Nights are focused on her getting to the Peggle Institute, and then getting her diploma. Marina's name is based off of a main character in the famous playwright Shakespeare's play Pericles.Trivia Peggle Nights Guide  Peggle Nights level Guide This is a list of all of the levels in Peggle Nights Deluxe where you can compile your best moves on certain levels , or add extra information and pictures of the levels. Bjorn Jimmy Lightning Renfield Kat Tut Splork Claude Tula Lord Cinderbottom Warren Master Hu Marina Master Challenges list of Peggle nights challenges Monkeymanmo 15:26, 11 February 2009 (UTC)Lord Cinderbottom  Lord Cinderbottom is a Wyvern who wishes to become a firefighter, as shown in Peggle Nights. He is one of the more peaceful species of dragons, a wyvern to be specific.Appearance  Cinderbottom is a Wyvern who has green skin with a white belly. Wings with within blue, as well the end of his tail. He has red/orange eyes.Power  Lord Cinderbottom's Fireball has the ability to burn through Pegs, making them dissapear altogether. Before launching one of these miniature suns the  Free Ball Bucket will be blocked by a metal dome, as so to allow the fireball to bounce about and hit more pegs. This effect is similar to the barrier employed by Claude , however it does not react to the player directly. Under the flaming inferno of Lord Cinderbottom's firebreath it will melt away the barrier on the first bounce, allowing the Fireball to go in on the second one. This gives the player a free ball, and 25,000 Style points. As with all powers, you can get a bonus for hitting two green pegs in one shot. In Lord Cinderbottom's case, this is known as \"Great balls of Fire\".Levels Peggle Trivia Splork  Splork is an alien who is a master of Bowling; or at least he wants to be. He is also a member of the Peggle Institute and is the fourth character whose face you come across in Peggle's Adventure Mode.Appearance  He wears a red T-shirt,has a red eye and his skin is greenSpace Blast  Splork's magic power is called Space Blast, which uses highly advanced alien technology to light up all pegs nearby.Big Bang  (25,000 pts) - Hitting both green pegs in one turn.Levels  The following are Splork's levels in adventure mode.Peggle Peggle Nights Tips Trivia Tula Peggle  Tula is a Peggle Master in Peggle.

When this event happens little smiley flowers light 20% of the remaining orange pegs on the level. The smiley flowers select the Orange pegs closest to the green peg.Special Style Points Usage's tip Peggle Blast  Tula reappears in Peggle Blast with the new power named Sunburst. She is the 11 character in this game and appears in a world where it rains and is in midnight.Appearance  She holds an umbrella and wears a light-blue raincoat. She also wears a red hat. When the player is about to use her power, her hat will disappear for some reason. Her mouth is red.Sunburst  This power will be activited after the turn when the player hits a green peg. There will be a light-fire circle which has a large area around the ball, similar to the Ring of Fire's circle. When the player fires the ball, it will move slower and the player will be required to tap on the screen's device to hit all the pegs inside the circle area. Once hit, they will be \"exploded\" by flowers. These will disappear when the player gets the score. In Tula's world, the area will be lighter, becoming the daylight screen.Warren  Warren is a magical rabbit, and the 8th character you meet in Peggle, and also the 9th character, and also second-to-last in Peggle Blast Warren was born and raised in the slums of the peggle institute, but fought his way out by using his rabbit kickboxing.

Claude's power creates two controllable flippers in the two bottom corners, making it easier to get good Combos. The flippers are controlled by the mouse and can bounce the ball back into the board to hit more pegs.Special Style Points Levels Peggle Peggle Nights Tips  to be addedTrivia Ultra Extreme Fever Description  An Ultra Extreme Fever is almost identical to an Extreme fever, with the exception that the player will receive a Blue Ribbon and the text \"Ultra Extreme Fever\" when they clear every peg, including blues.How is Ultra Extreme Fever different to Extreme Fever?  As seen in the image to the right, the bottom is lined with 100,000 buckets rather than 10,000, 50,000 and 100,000. You also tend to get lots more points, as you have to clear every peg.How Can I Get an Ultra Extreme Fever?  There are 2 main things you need to know before you go for an Ultra Extreme Fever. How to get one, and what Peggle Master to use.How Do I Get Them?  This is simple. Clear all the pegs. The most difficult thing is, the order to clear the in. So here's what you should do. Get your magic powers, then clear orange pegs as normal until either: There are only 5 orange pegs left OR There are only 5 balls left. When either of these occurs, start avoiding the oranges as much as possible and concentrate on the blues. Where possible, start a shot with the purple.What Peggle Master do I use?  These are usually stated in our level guides, but if they're not, use Renfield.Peggle Nights  Peggle Nights is a downloadable game from PopCap Games. It is the sequel to 2007's Peggle. It is also unlockable in Peggle: Dual Shot for the Nintendo DS. However, in Peggle Dual Shot, Marina is not unlockable. The gameplay between the two games has remained largely unchanged, with each featuring a colorful 2D background filled with different colored \"pegs\". The objective in each level is to clear all of the Orange Pegs by hitting them with a ball shot from the top of the screen. New to this version are 60 new levels, 60 additional Challenges, the introduction of the new Peggle Master Marina, and the addition of an \"Aced\" score for each level. As of January 2010, three expansions have been released: a holiday theme, a spring theme, and a pack with fan-art-based levels. Both come with extra Adventure levels and Challenges. The Xbox Live Arcade version of Peggle received Peggle Nights content in the form of a downloadable expansion for the game on November 18, 2009, at a cost of 400 Microsoft Points. The iOS and Android versions of Peggle received Peggle Nights content as an In-App Purchase on October 4, 2010, for the cost of $0.99.Gameplay  Gameplay for Peggle Nights has remained nearly the same as the original game, although additional types of style shots (such as Off The Wall) have been added. As its opening theme, the game uses the classical piece \"Clair de lune\", the third movement from the piano suite \"Suite bergamasque\" by Claude Debussy.Das Bucket Description  Das Bucket is the fourth level in the Adventure Mode. The level, as the title suggests, is shaped like a bucket.Strategy guide  The best way to win in Das Bucket is to select Jimmy Lightning as your character, as the green pegs are often at the top. If they are, aim at a Green Peg, and try to angle the shot so that it will bounce back at the other green. This can make for incredible shots that take out nearly all of the board (once I Sk8r2000 20:42, 24 October 2008 (UTC) nearly got an Ultra Extreme Fever in one shot using this method.) You can also use Renfield, and aim to hit one of the Green pegs on the first ball and send the ball down the side of the bucket to score a super slide bonus. Quite often the spooky ball will then hit the other green peg as well as the purple peg and you can easily get >600,000 points for this level.

When you first play Peggleland there are only orange and blue pegs.Strategy  For an Ultra Extreme Fever choose Renfield and as your first shot aim at one of the Green Pegs so you will get an extra ball. If you are lucky the next \"ghost ball\" will hit the second green peg and will get you big points and at least 2 Free Balls because of the combo. When that combo is over simply fire your balls at the remaining Pegs causing you to get an Ultra Extreme Fever.Adventure Mode  Adventure Mode is the main mode playable in Peggle, Peggle Nights and Peggle Extreme. It slowly takes the player through each of the facets of the game, including describing the Blue Peg, the Orange Peg, the Purple Peg, the Green Peg, the Ball-O-Tron, the Bucket, and each of the master's abilities. The Player starts Adventure Mode without the use of any master's ability, and then progresses through each of the 10 masters, starting with Bjorn, and ending with Master Hu except in Peggle Nights, where the player will end with Marina. The final stages, known as Master Levels, allow you to use any of the masters and their abilities. When the player has completed the adventure he or she is awarded with a Peggle Trophy and a note. The trophy is placed near Bjorn on the main menu. Also, after finishing Adventure mode, Challenge Mode is unlocked, allowing the player to play the levels, except with an added twist, such as having Pyramid, Flippers, and Fireball in the challenge Pinball Wizard.See Also  Challenge modeThe Dude Abides Description  The Dude Abides is Master Hu's second level and nested rotating circles. The level name comes from the film The Big Lebowski, in which the man character \"The Dude\" was very fond of bowling. During the movie, he says to The Stranger \"The Dude Abides\".Strategy  Magic Hat is great once you get inside the rotating circles. A well placed Space Blast can open up the circles effectively.Spiral of Doom  Spiral of doom is Jimmy's 4th and penultimate level.Appearance  Spiral of doom (photo right) is shaped like a snail,and if shot in the right place the player can get a slide bonus worth 50.000 points,around the snail there are scattered pegs.Related links  GuidesSlip and Slide Description  Slip and Slide is Bjorn's second level and has two ramps made of pegs on either side.Strategy  For big points and Free balls use Renfield's spooky ball. If the Green Peg is on one of the ramps than aim for the top of where the ramp starts for an Extreme Slide! Bonus and big points.Zen Frog  Level 10-5 is the last and probably most difficult of Master Hu's \"Zen\" levels. It has two snaking strands of pegs wiggling back and forth on each side of the screen. There are also several pegs arranged in patterns in the middle, and a few on the high sides. To complete the level in adventure mode, immediately go for a green peg, and on the next shot get the ball to go into the far left or right side snake so that it will fall from top to bottom down the side of the screen hitting as many orange pegs out of the snake as possible. Next, clear out orange pegs in all but the opposite side, but don't hit the other green peg yet. Then for the second snake, get the second green peg, and your \"Zen\" shot should get most of the rest in the snake (using the same top to bottom type shot as the first). For a 100% clear on this level, use Claude Lobster for his Flippers. On your first shot, hit a green peg to make the flippers appear while also getting the ball to bounce to the very left or right side of the screen so that it falls down one of the snakes right onto the flipper. Use the flipper to bounce it into the snake on that side, and hit as many pegs as you can. Repeat for the opposite side. It's easy to let the ball bounce under the flippers as the snake is winding away at the bottom, so be careful to keep the ball in play. It may take several tries to get good at this, so keep at it! Once the left and right sides are cleared out, use free ball skills to finish the rest of the pegs. Be sure to leave at least one orange peg for last!", "Bad Eggs ONLINE Wiki": "Bad Eggs ONLINE Wiki ", "\u041f\u0430\u0441\u0445\u0430\u043b\u043a\u0438 \u0432\u0438\u043a\u0438": "\u041f\u0430\u0441\u0445\u0430\u043b\u043a\u0438 \u0432\u0438\u043a\u0438 ", "Egglike Wiki": "Egglike Wiki ", "TheCheeseEggOmlete Wiki": "TheCheeseEggOmlete Wiki ", "Roblox Easter Eggs and Information Wiki": "Roblox Easter Eggs and Information Wiki ", "Easteregg & Secrets Wiki": "Easteregg & Secrets Wiki ", "Peggle Ti\u1ebfng Vi\u1ec7t Wiki": "Peggle Ti\u1ebfng Vi\u1ec7t Wiki ", "Sonic.Exe Nightmare Beggining \u0432\u0438\u043a\u0438": "Sonic.Exe Nightmare Beggining \u0432\u0438\u043a\u0438 ", "Egg Farm Simulator RBLX Wiki": "Egg Farm Simulator RBLX Wiki ", "Egg Farm Simulator Guide Wiki": "Egg Farm Simulator Guide Wiki ", "Egg Farm Simulator Roblox Wiki": "Egg Farm Simulator Roblox Wiki ", "Egg Farm Simulator ROBLOX Wiki": "Egg Farm Simulator ROBLOX Wiki ", "The Adventures of Stegg Wiki": "The Adventures of Stegg Wiki ", "EggNerdGaming Wiki": "EggNerdGaming Wiki ", "Rblx Egg Farm Simulator Wiki": "Rblx Egg Farm Simulator Wiki ", "How to get money fast on project pokemon Wiki": "How to get money fast on project pokemon Wiki ", "Pokep\u00e8dia": "Pokep\u00e8dia ", "Nederlandse Pok\u00e9mon Wiki": "Nederlandse Pok\u00e9mon Wiki ", "Wiki Teorias Pokemon": "Wiki Teorias Pokemon ", "AdVenture Capitalist Wiki": "AdVenture Capitalist Wiki ", "Minecraft Fanon Wiki": "Minecraft Fanon Wiki Minecraft Fanon Wiki  Welcome to the Minecraft Fanon Wiki\nThis is the wiki dedicated to providing fan content and stories to for the Minecraft world!

The easiest way to avoid them is to use an Ender Amulet. This mainly ensures that when you look at a netherman, they will not actually attack you. The main uses of Nethermen is their red enderpearls, which can be crafted with 1 Redstone and 1 stone block to produce 32 Redstone ore blocks. They spawn in nether fortresses, but can roam across the entire Nether. They will, rarely, pass through Nether portals, which allows them to wreak havoc in the Overworld. They only spawn in Hard or Hardcore difficulties.Habits  Nethermen are highly susceptible to attack from behind, as they infrequently turn around, and when they do, turn around at less than half the normal speed. It is possible to avoid one simply by running past them on the side they are not facing, as they will not be able to get a lock and teleport to you. Nethermen are different to Endermen in one other respect- as they are found entirely in the Nether, their psyche is almost controlled by lava. They are immune to lava, and can swim through it at the speed that a player normally runs. They move lava blocks instead of other blocks, and so can teleport behind the player and place the block onto the player, effectively killing him. They are also immune to lava, and so will not perish if they fall into it. Theoretically, they could walk around a lava lake indefinitely. They attract ghasts, and sometimes hundreds can converge into their general area. Note that they do not spawn ghasts, merely attract them. They also set fire to blocks in between their teleport locations, This can be used to trap creepers, or other mobs, but can also be the players downfall. Very rarely, a nether enderman will pick up a block of netherrack, and place it somewhere else, but this rarely happens. In an even rarer instance, The enderman will walk through a portal carrying a block of lava or netherack.Destruction of Minecraftia  In Destruction of Minecraftia, the Nethermen are the evil henchmen of The Voice in the Darkness and The Eye of Ender, a powerful Enderman overlord. They have conquered the Nether and are now turning their attention to the Overworld. They are leading the Dark Army to conquer everything that stands in their way, including the group of Cody, Alexander, Rowan and Bleek. And in 72 hours, they will sacrifice Steve and Testificate to the Voice and the Endermen shall conquer all!Cannon  Cannons are block types that can be placed to guard homes and other buildings.Information  A cannon is a block that you can place, then when you pull the lever on it, it launches TNT from the Cannon. Once you launch it, in order to launch another block of TNT, you have to right-click the Cannon with a block of TNT in your hand. It will remove the block of TNT from your inventory and then you can pull the lever again and it launches another block of TNT! It can launch TNT up to 25 blocks away. A Cannon can be upgraded by placing two canons next to each other! Creating a large canon, which can fire up to 4 blocks of TNT, up to 35 blocks away!Ender Creeper  An Ender Creeper is a hostile mob found in the End\u00a0in Minecraft: A New Start. It is a combination of a creeper and an enderman. It explodes just like a creeper and teleports like an enderman. When hit by an explosion, it teleports the Player to a random place in ender pearl radius. Like other mobs (except enderman), the ender creeper can only be encountered by revisting the End after defeating the Ender Dragon. Drops: Ender Powder (3-5), Music Disc-Ender (killed by Ender Blaze)Pink Creeper  Pink Creepers have a much larger blast radius than normal creepers, They also spawn obsidian blocks in a circle around them in a circle when they detonate, making them a good way to obsidian farm. They can only spawn in places like dungeons, strongholds, and abandoned mine shafts, where mob spawners occur. The mob spawners that spawn them only spawn in hard mode. Pink creepers also hate bright lights, and will burn much more quickly than zombies or skeletons, preventing them from spawning when torches or lava are placed close to the spawner, even the spawner will burn!Appearance  This mob is bright pink, they have many shapes, and are meant to stand out in dark caves to scare the player, they are larger than creepers.Nether Dragon  The Nether Dragon is a Serpentine-Cuboid Dragon encountered during entrance of the Nether. Unlike the Enderdragon, it does not fly often, unless attacked more than 5 times, they stomp around and breathe some fire, occasionally shooting a fire charge. Without at least a wooden sword, the damage you do will not effect it. All swords harm it, and Diamond and Gold swords are the best to use. Nether Dragons (when found and only, found in a far place) will close the Overworld Portal, but when defeated, the Overworld Portal appears right next to you If you die by some mobs and sssswsa, you have to fight the Nether Dragon again. The Nether Dragon is imprisoned within an unknown Nether Fortress and, if you destroy one of the Blaze spawner triggers, it will be released. The Netherdragon, though not as powerful as the Enderdragon, is a very deadly force of destruction. It will also spawn at least a dozen Withers to throw you off the track, but being registered as undead, the Withers won't harm it. Only when you have slain all the Withers will the Netherdragon become mortal. It can also brainwash all the Nether mobs to do it's bidding. The Netherdragon is a force to be reckoned with. When it dies, it will drop a rFire Core, which can be used to craft a Clarent Sword, the most powerful weapon in all Minecraftia. Be advised that if you have a Clarent Sword, then Creepers will follow you, but fortunately the sword makes it impossible for Creepers to harm you, including Ender Creepers and Fire Creepers. However, the sword can be treacherous, so bring along some cats when you have the sword. The nether dragon has the ability\u00a0\u00a0to create lava and shoot fire balls too. Attacking it without protection, you could instantly die. It's body will not harm you, but the scales on its body are very sharp. It is immune to fire and lava. This Nether Dragon is from a mod. It will not respawn if you revisit the nether. It is immune to enchantments and bows,unlike the Enderdragon do basically no damage.Statistics Achivements  Fire out!

Tigers have 15 hearts and are untamable save for the cubs which have a 25% chance to spawn. Cubs can be tamed if fed 5-10 bones or 2-4 raw pork, chicken or beef, you must then place a Cat Collar on the said cub and name it. They have a standing and sitting position, similar to wolves.Characteristics  During the day, tigers will actively seek cover in below ground 'burrows' or under small trees or bushes, while at night they hunt passive mobs and players. Tigers are quite tall, roughly the size of the player in terms of height and being 3 blocks long, in their sitting position they are 1 and a half blocks long and 2 blocks high. Tigers will not pursue prey outside of the biome they spawned in. They can run twice as fast as the playerTaming and Breeding  As stated before tiger cubs can be tamed by feeding them specific things and then being given a cat collar. Tigers grow to full size in 10 Minecraft days, they can be healed by being fed cat food, raw pork, beef or chicken. Right-clicking them will make them sit. Breeding involves feeding 2 full grown tigers Cat Hearts which will initiate love mode. Tigers require a pen at least 4x4x4 to breed, with no players within 10 blocks of them. Breeding may breed a White Tiger (1 in 10 chance), a Grey tiger (1 in 30 chance) and breeding a White and Grey tiger together may produce a Black Tiger (1 in 50 chance).White, Grey, and Black Tigers  White Tigers have 20 hearts and can be ridden with a Big Cat Saddle, they can jump 3 blocks. Grey Tigers have 25 hearts and can be ridden with a Big Cat Saddle, they can jump 6 blocks. Black Tigers run 3 times faster than the player, have 30 hearts can be ridden with a Big Cat Saddle and can jump 9 blocks.Subspecies Spawn Block  The spawn block is a block that can reset the spawn point of the player without having to sleep in a bed, And it can even work in the nether and end! When broken, the spawn block has a 50% chance of dropping just the bed, or the entire spawn block.Crafting Combination  G=Glass B=Bed 0=empty space 0 G 0 G B G 0 G 0Appearence  Spawn blocks often appear in void cities, or NPC villages. At first, they spawn nothing, but if you use them right, they can spawn you, or anything else!Usage  You can set your spawn point by right clicking on the block. This will set your spawn point to the location of the spawn block. If you can lead a mob within 2 blocks of the Spawn block, it will automatically spawn that mob every so often like a spawner. This is useful fornmaking mob grinders and such. Sometimes, spawn blocks may appear as traps, spawning large amounts of dangerous mobs or bosses.Privacy policy  Please see Central Wikia Privacy Policy.Dynamite  Dynamite is a thrown explosive that is crafted as shown on the picture on the right.Crafting  If you cannot see the crafting recipie as it is fairly small, it is crafted like this: S\u00a0:String G\u00a0:Gunpowder O\u00a0:Empty Space. O S O O G O O G OUsage  Dynamite is very easy to use: you simply have to right click while the dynamite is selected, and watch it shoot out to the direction that you were facing, and it will explode.Ninja Pigman  Ninja Pigmen are Passive mobs that you can tame by giving them a sword. When you attack a mob with a tamed Ninja Pigman, the Ninja Pigman starts violently attacking the mob. Ninja Pigmen also tend to become more aggressive and impatient over time if not given a sword, and can become deadly if they become too impatient with the player. Furthermore, they will only except iron swords, stone swords, or diamond swords, making it harder to get them a satisfied. They do use the durability bar on their swords, so they will break after they use them enough. If you do not give them a sword after theirs breaks soon enough, they will become untamed and hostile and attack.Nether Creeper  The Nether Creeper, also known as the fire creeper, this mob is found in the nether, but also, it will appear in the normal world. The nether creeper is red, orange, or any other fire color, and are impossible to find in lava or fire. They only spawn in Hard or Hardcore mode. They have a much larger blast radius, and every block touched by the blast will burst into flames, this includes the player or other mobs! They like you. The nether creeper Will follow you like herobrine and just want their own entrance.Prokaryote Colony  The Prokaryote Colony is a large mass of pathogens that are neutral. They only appear underwater, making them hard to find. They will attack when they are disturbed at all, even if they are just touched. The prokaryote colony attacks you by poisoning you. then raming you into blocks, or other mobs. The prokaryote colony appears in Atlantis dimension\u00a0: levels 8 - 40 (underwater) Overworld: levels 4 - 20 (underwater)Atlantis  The Atlantis dimension is an under water zone with cities.new blocks  the new blocks introduced is the Elder Sign, The Atlantis Gate, And Atlantian gold.Elder Sign  The elder sign is a bock that resembles a sign with a star on it, that is on the door to the forbidden chamber in the center of the atlantis dimension. It can only be broken with a daimond or obsidian sword. Once broken, Cthulhu will spawn.Atlantis Gate  the atlantis gate is a type of portal block. There are only 4 of them, and they are arranged in a sort of nether portal made of gold blocks. They can be acctivated with a Deep One Eye, which is crafted with an ender eye and 4 deep one scales.Atlantian Gold  It looks like a gold chisseled sand stone, and is as hard as bedrock.Getting to atlantis  First you must craft a submarine. Submarine: GOLD-GLASS-GOLD GLASS-GOLD-GLASS GOLD-GLASS-GOLD Then you must go to the deepest part of the ocean and kill deep ones untill you have 16 deep one scales. You then need 4 ender eyes to craft deep one eyes. Deep One Eye: SCALE-NOTHING-SCALE NOTHING-ENDER EYE- NOTHING SCALE-NOTHING-SCALE You Then need to locate the atlantis Door, Which will have 4 atlantis gate blocks. Put an Deep One Eye into each, and then step through the portal.Boss Cthulhu:  You have to find the temple, R'lyeh, in the center of the atlantis dimension. Then you must break the elder sign with a daimond sword or higher. Once broken, cthulhu will spawn inside and destroy the temple. He will then proceed to destroy atlantis.Mobs\u00a0:  Mermaid Fish Rainbow Squid Prokaryote Colony Atlantis Village Seacreeper Cthulhu Deep OnesAnthromorphic Spider  The Anthropomorphic Spider (also known as Village Spider) is a hostile mob.Appearance  Anthropomorphic Spiders have a few appearances. It will in single player appear with the player's skin or the default skin, except with a spider's head. They will in strongholds appear with a monk's robe, and will only spawn in libraries, underneath a cobweb. If a player manages to destroy all cobwebs in a stronghold, no more Anthropomorphic Spiders will spawn inside. In Multiplayer, an Anthropomorphic Spider will take on the skin of one random online player.Combat  Anthropomorphic Spiders will attack the player quickly. There is little delay between attacks. They spawn naturally in villages at night. They also have a chance of spawning inside strongholds. They are neutral in this case. They may also spawn riding a spider.Trivia CreeperNova  A CreeperNova is a type of Creeper. It looks the same as a normal creeper except that its eyes are red. When you approach it, it grows larger and larger until it explodes in an explosion twice as powerful as a normal creeper and 1 second later the crater fills with Lava. The best way to kill this mob is to get far away and use a bow and arrows. The small version of the creeper dies in 4 hits of a diamond sword, The half-way giant dies in 8 hits of a diamond sword, and the giant one dies in 12 hits of a diamond sword. CreeperNova are also weak against water, which downsizes there explosions and kills them.Drops  When killed, a CreeperNova will drop the following:Aqua-Blaze  Aqua-Blazes are neutral mobs in Minecraft: A New Start that attack the player only when attacked.Details  Aqua-Blazes appear much like normal blazes, but with a blue-tinted skin and glowing blue-white eyes. Also like blazes, they catch their respective element when targeting an enemy, but Aqua-Blazes catch aquafire instead of normal fire. Aqua-Blazes also rapidly produce bubble particles when targeting. They are immune to lava and fire unless it is inflicted upon them by a blaze. Aqua-Blazes fire water charges instead of fire charges, which set players on aquafire.Location  Aqua-Blazes spawn in Atlantean Cities in the Aqua Dimension much like villagers in villages. Additionally, every Atlantean Ruin spawns with one Aqua-Blaze.Behavior  Like Guardians, Aqua-Blazes are hostile towards squid and will attack them with aquatic charges. If a Nether Portal is within seventy-five blocks of an Aqua-Blaze, it will pathfind to seek it out and enter the Nether. Aqua-Blazes are naturally hostile towards regular blazes, and if there are blazes nearby an Aqua-Blaze, it will attempt to attack them. This usually results in the Aqua-Blaze's death after facing multiple blazes at once. They may also hunt squid. If you attack one, then the others will also attack you.Drops Steel creeper  The Steel Creeper, is a Creeper like Mob that is created out of a coating of metal. The Charged Steel Creeper is a Steel Creeper that is hit by lightning. It has better knockback and a bigger crater when it explodes. \u00a0\u00a0Weaknesses  A Steel Creeper can be easily killed with the following items:Drops  When a Steel Creeper is killed, here is what it will leave behind:Dj 3nder  Dj 3nder is a Non-hostile NPC who is only found in towns. They reside in taverns and will dispense some bread if right-clickd on while holding an iron ingot. This does consume the entire stack of ingots in your hand, But the Dj will give you a fair amount of bread.Characteristics  They look just like Endermen but with blue eyes,a purple jacket with a slime on it, and black headphones.They only attack if attacked, but like endermen, they get hurt in water. They are confined to the tavern they spawn in and will dissapear with a particle effect if they are moved from the tavern or the tavern is completely destroyed. Dj 3nder will also rarly spawn in the end, and spawn riding the ender dragon, wich has 1% chance of happening. If you kill Dj 3nder, it will spawn a hostile enderman nearby.Quotes  \"Alright, guys, I'm gonna play you a little song.

It uses a revolutionary skin, being completely invisible when stationary and simply causing the air around it to darken when moving. The main point of this is to render the mobs very hard to spot. They are completely non-hostile, until such a point as an unsuspecting player swims around it, at which point they will retreat a few paces, then inflict 1 heart of damage per half second to the player. There is no way of stopping it. The easiest method of avoiding them, because attacking is useless, is to simply stay on land. If no water blocks are present, they will be destroyed. Therefore, they cannot step on land, and so will not attack you if you stay on land. Swamp monsters will only spawn in swamp biomes, and will spawn in 1/1000 surface water blocks.Swamp Monster  Swamp monsters are a three block tall and two blocks wide, They have fins and gills. They have webbed hands, and dark red eyes, like spiders. there hands are very large for swiming. They only have two large toes for increased movement in water.Herobrine  You may be looking for Herobrine (disambiguation). Herobrine is a main antagonist in most stories of fanon Minecraft. According to the Creepypasta, he is Notch's dead brother and possibly Nidarc's brother too. We have no idea. The first sighting of Herobrine stated that Notch had said \"I have a brother he is no longer with us\" but has later stated that he has no brother, aside from a half-brother whom he rarely sees. Legends say he is the ruler of the Nether, sort of an inversion of Notch's Overworld. He makes ghastly experiments, such as reanimating Pigmen, brewing potions (such as the Sangue Rosso), and creating plots to take over the Overworld. He also destroys the leaves on trees and sets out traps for Minecrafters. According to Notch, he can be summoned by killing animals with lava, and is a benevolent being. He can be obtained into the game by using mods like Herobrine's Mod. In that mod, they add Herobrines including Burrito Brine, Blaze Brine, standard Herobrine, H20 hero, and Foliage Brine. In some works, he is a good guy; he is only warning us about entity 303. That is why he griefed us all to show what entity 303 will do in the futurePowers and Abilities  He has been said to run and swim faster than the player, though he has also been said not to move conventionally at all, relying solely on his ability to teleport. He can differentiate every material and block. He has the ability to build and destroy and it is thought that he has a limited supply. He takes up 2 forms-Canonical and Vengeful, In his Canonical form he stalks the player and disappears if approached. In his Vengeful form, he has been reported to ensnare the player in traps, wait for them to enter his dungeon and seal them inside or teleport behind them and kill them. He is supposedly responsible for breaking the player's creations and stealing from their chests. He reportedly has telekinesis, reality warping powers, and is virtually invincible. The initial sighting of Herobrine reported no abilities, and Herobrine simply ran away from the player.Is Herobrine Real?  Currently, Herobrine has not been proven present in any version of Minecraft. However, you can have Herobrine present in your PC world by downloading a mod or have a player wear a Herobrine skin activated. On the Xbox and PlayStation version of Minecraft, players that download various skin packs may come across multiple Herobrine variants. These include the standard skin and Zombie Herobrine. As for there being a real Herobrine incorporated into the game, Minecraft developers have stated that they would one day like to have Herobrine as part of the game... Prior to Beta 1.8, there was a mob simply titled \"Monster\" which looked exactly like Steve, it could be spawned in preclassic, but this feature was later removed in the early stages of classic; Intriguingly, beta 1.6.6, an update in which all of the monster's class files were removed, was also the first time Notch included the \"removed Herobrine\" message present in the changelogs. The original sighting included a screenshot, in which leaves were lighter than the color they were changed to in Alpha 1.2.0, meaning the \"monster\" was still present in the game, and had it's stats intact, though it couldn't spawn. It may be possible that in versions prior to beta 1.8, these \"monsters\" spawned due to a glitch, being misidentified as Herobrine. As for Notch having a dead brother, Notch has two siblings: An estranged half-brother (source) and a sister (source), both of whom are still living and neither of who are in the game.In Fan Stories/Books Trivia Pronounciation  Herobrine is sometimes erroneously pronounced as \"hero brin\", or spelled \"hero brine\".Quotes  \"I've publicly told people there's never been any such thing as Herobrine, and that I don't have any dead brothers, and that letting too many animals die in lava is a foolproof way to summon him but that you don't need to be afraid of him. He only means well, he's looking out for you, trying to warn you of the dangers you can't see. There certainly are NO physical manifestations of Herobrine that will sneak out of your computer if you leave Minecraft running at night, looming over you as you sleep with his pale eyes inches away from your face, as he tries to shout at you to wake up. Sometimes you wake up with a jolt, and he's gone, and all that lingers is the memory and faint echo of his wordless screaming. Of course, it was just a dream. There's no way a morally dubious ghost with a god complex could at any point decide to haunt the children who play my game \"for their own good\", as there is NO SUCH THING. etc -Notch \"Herobrine cannot be destroyed!\" -Herobrine, at the end of Herobrine's Legend (book)Lairs / Homes References  Powerful/God-like beings", "Minecraft Russian \u0432\u0438\u043a\u0438": "Minecraft Russian \u0432\u0438\u043a\u0438 Crafting  Crafting is a game mechanic in Minecraft that allows players to place materials in a grid to create\u00a0useful items and blocks.Overview  Players will be able to access a small 2x2 crafting grid in their Inventory. Simple items and blocks can be crafted using this grid. However, a crafting table must be used in order to craft most items and blocks. Once a player constructs a crafting table using planks\u00a0(four wooden planks in a 2x2 square), he/she is able to construct more advanced items/blocks such as tools, chests and furnaces. The crafting table has a larger 3x3 crafting grid and the ability to create tools and weapons. Some items/blocks take more time and effort to gather resources for than others.Crafting Process  In order to craft objects successfully, a player must make a shape of the desired object in the crafting grid. When a player has successfully arranged the materials in the right order within the grid, the object to be produced will appear in a separate, single box of the crafting interface, where a player may pick it up and place it in their inventory. In the Minecraft: Xbox 360 Edition, Minecraft: Xbox One Edition and Minecraft: Pocket Edition, the interface tells a player all the ingredients needed to craft the object in question while in the PC version a player must find out the recipes on their own without the recipe book, but the recipe book was added to PC in the 1.12 update. In the Xbox 360 and Xbox One editions, there is an option for \"classic crafting\" which makes the crafting interface more like the PC version's crafting interface when enabled. A crafting table is the main tool for crafting. It is impossible to succeed in Minecraft without the use of a crafting table as it is needed to create: Pickaxes, Armor, weapons, furnaces and most other items/blocks. In the Minecraft: PlayStation 4 Edition and other console editions, the items needed to craft an object are displayed in the crafting grid without the need of recipes. This makes the crafting grid more of a visual 'ingredient' list. This was likely added so that casual players could enjoy the game without spending a lot of time learning recipes as well as to lessen the already-high learning curve. Another possibility is that it is difficult to quickly move items around the inventory crafting grid by using a controller alone (even with the touch-pad, it is still not as easy as using a computer mouse).Mobs  Mobs are living game entities that are affected by physics and can interact with Players or other mobs.Overview  Mobs can be divided into three behavioral categories: Passive, Neutral and Hostile. Some mobs will change their behavior in response to certain situations (eg. if they are attacked). Mobs usually drop items and Experience Points when killed, with Hostile and \"boss\" mobs tending to drop rarer and higher-quality items.Mob Types Utility  Utility mobs are those which are created by players. They can protect players and villagers from hostile mobs (with the exception of Creepers). They usually attack hostile mobs, but in certain situations, can attack any type of mob or player. A notable exception is The Wither, which attacks all mobs except those considered undead.Passive  Passive mobs are harmless to players, and some will flee if attacked. they often provide beneficial items for players, if the right tool is used (eg. Shears to collect Wool or a Bucket to collect Milk). Some mobs become passive only after they are tamed. Like utility mobs, they can also protect a player from hostile mobs.Neutral  Neutral mobs will attack a player only when provoked. However, they can sometimes attack other mobs as well.Hostile  Hostile mobs will attack a player when he/she gets within a certain range. For most hostile mobs, the range is typically 16 blocks, without any obstructions. Some mobs can sense a player from much farther away, like Ghasts, who detect all players within 100 blocks.Boss  A \"boss\" mob is a special type of hostile mob that has more health than most, a larger detection range, and triggers a health bar and name to appear at the top of a player's screen when they are within range.Unused  Unused mobs exist in the Minecraft source code, but cannot be spawned in default survival mode, without the use of Commands.Education Edition  These mobs only exist in the Education Edition version of Minecraft.Unimplemented  Unimplemented mobs may have been planned for a past update, but do not currently exist within Minecraft.Removed  Removed mobs no longer exist in modern Minecraft, but can be encountered in older versions of the game.Trivia Ender Dragon  [view] \u2022 [talk] The Ender Dragon is a hostile boss mob that appears in The End. She is a dragon creature that spits fire and can fly with ease.Overview  Since Beta 1.9 pre-release 6, a single ender dragon appears in each world's End, and can be fought and killed. She swoops at a player, destroying any blocks she passes through, except Obsidian, indestructible blocks (such as Bedrock), Iron Bars, and End Stone. Once an ender dragon is killed, an End Gateway appears in the vicinity, with a dragon egg on top. The end gateway leads to the \"Outer End\". Upon defeat, the ender dragon performs an exploding animation and drops around 12,000 Experience Orbs (which take a player with no experience to around level 78), activates the Exit Portal, and spawns a dragon egg on top of the portal frame. When one Ender Crystal is placed on each edge of the exit portal\u2014for a total of 4\u2014then the dragon will respawn. However, when defeated, she drops a lot less experience and no dragon egg.Appearance  The ender dragon is a large, black dragon with glowing purple eyes. She is the second-largest mob in the game. Only the unimplemented giant is larger. She has a few dark gray features, such as the wings, and various other parts of her body. Similar to the eyes of endermen and Spiders, the ender dragon's eyes are visible through darkness, so a player can see her coming from anywhere in The End.Behavior  Ender dragons attack by charging at a player's lower waist, with their wings tucked in and diving downward. If hit with anything while swooping towards a player, even a fist, she will turn around and fly away. Ender crystals that sit on top of the obsidian towers will heal her. The ender dragon flies around the sky and shoots purple fire charges (Ender Acid). After a while, she will go down and hover above the inactive End Portal while constantly spraying ender acid out of her mouth, similar to how a dragon breathes fire when attacking.Strategy  Here are a few tips for fighting the dragon:Trivia Enderman  [view] \u2022 [talk] An Enderman is a Minecraft mob who, when a Player looks above its legs, will attack that player (with the only exception being if the player wears a Pumpkin), has long legs, purple eyes and can also pick up Blocks and move them around.Appearance  Endermen are tall, dark, and thin. They have long, skinny legs and arms, and pinkish-purple\u00a0eyes. They are about three blocks tall. They emit purple particle effects, which are the same as those emitted from Ender Pearls, end portals and Nether Portals.Behavior  Endermen will wander and will start to teleport around randomly, until a player attacks or \"stares\" at them\u00a0at under 65 blocks. \"Staring\" at an enderman is defined as aiming the cross hair at the enderman's head. Once a player looks at an enderman in the right spot, it becomes hostile toward them (unless the player is wearing a pumpkin head).\u00a0It will open its mouth and run or teleport to the player. An enderman will not be alerted if a player is protected by a method listed below. As of 1.4, the enderman will make a sound upon being provoked. The sound sounds similar to a loud running engine and is a warning to brace for sudden attacks. Even if the sounds have stopped, it does not guarantee that the enderman is no longer aggressive. It may have teleported far away from a player, or gotten stuck somewhere such as a nearby Cave. If a player leaves the world and then come back while being attacked by an enderman, it may have calmed down or teleported away. An aggressive enderman can be distracted from attacking a player if it is attacked by another mob, or if it is touched by sunlight. Endermen don't like sunlight, and will usually teleport to a cave or other covered location during the daytime. Endermen will take damage from both Water (including rain) and Fire or Lava, and will teleport away when they take most types of damage, but interestingly, they do not teleport away when coming into contact with fire or lava. If is raining, an enderman will teleport wildly until they teleport to a location where the rain doesn't hit them, most likely to a cave. Endermen cannot get hit by any type of projectile including arrows, snowballs, eggs, and negative splash potions. They will always teleport away immediately before getting hit. However, it is possible in the console versions of the game to hit an enderman with an arrow by aiming slightly above them so they don't teleport from being looked at. Endermen will occasionally pick up blocks at random times (even when aggressive), and then later place them somewhere else. If the enderman is killed with a block in its hand it will drop it. An enderman can pick up a block from any space directly adjacent to it (Including above its head or below its feet), and it can pick up some unexpected blocks, such as Cacti. If a player is wearing a pumpkin head, an Enderman might even take off the pumpkin. Endermen will attack Endermites (if the endermite was spawned from ender pearl teleportation) as long as there isn't a survival mode player nearby, in which case it prioritizes a player, even if it is not provoked. If an Enderman attacks a player for an extended period of time, so long as neither of you have died, eventually it will stop attacking you and start teleporting randomly. As of The Frostburn Update (for PC) and Minecraft: Pocket Edition 0.15.0, endermen can spawn in the Nether, making it almost impossible to avoid encountering endermen.Protection from Endermen  There are several ways to protect against enderman attacks. First, build \"Enderman Proof Shelters\", such as a pool of water or lava, as enderman will return to a neutral state once damaged by water or lava. A player can also build a two block tall house, as enderman cannot fit into a house too short. The best method, however, to protect against from endermen is to prevent them from attacking altogether. The simplest method is to wear a pumpkin in the helmet slot; while it significantly hinders vision, endermen will not be provoked by staring. Pumpkins will not stop endermen from attacking if they have already been provoked. In bases, having windows made out of glass is also a good idea, as glass will block the staring. If an enderman is already hostile and attacking, then being in a corner could potentially be a good idea, as the enderman will not be able to teleport behind one. After one has cornered themselves, remember that the best weapon against an enderman is surprisingly not a Diamond Sword, but rather, a Bucket of water.History Trivia Mobs  A list of all mobs that appear in Minecraft.Items Creeper  [view] \u2022 [talk] Creepers are one of the most unique and iconic hostile mobs found in Minecraft. A creeper can easily be recognized by its tall vertical structure (roughly the size of a player), green, pixelated skin, and four legs. It is one of\u00a0the most dangerous enemy in the game, as it is not affected by sunlight (but it can despawn after a while), which makes it a constant threat as it silently roams the map, searching for a player to explode upon. It should be noted, however, that most creepers do Despawn during the day, along with Spiders. It is often used as the game's mascot by Mojang.Origin  The creeper was created by accident by Notch, the creator of Minecraft. While Notch was trying to create the first ever passive mob, the pig, the code went wrong, and he accidentally swapped the height and length. As a result, he got a tall, slim being with the face and torso in the shape of a player instead of a pig. With no arms and 4 stubby legs, this creature became known as the creeper, a mob that when provoked or within distance of player blows up. It has earned Minecraft billions in marketing, and it is one of the most recognizable Minecraft mob and character, another example being Steve.Behavior  A creeper who has found a player will chase down that player until the distance between them is only a few blocks. It should be noted that creepers tend to walk to the right of a player. The creeper makes use of a suicide-bomb attack involving getting within close proximity of a player (usually 2\u20133 blocks) before exploding. A player's only warning to when the creeper is about to explode is by a very distinctive hiss, as well as the swelling and flashing of the creeper itself, which starts about 1\u20132 seconds prior to the explosion. If a player tries moving away when a creeper is hissing, it will cancel the detonation; however, the harder the Difficulty, the further away a player has to get. It takes three full seconds for the creeper to detonate. After it explodes, it will leave a large crater in the ground. The size of this crater is solely dependent on what the terrain is made from. Typically, a hole in the topsoil is created. However, they can be powerful enough to destroy Stone. When a creeper is killed by an arrow shot by a Skeleton, it will drop a random Music Disc, which can be played in a Jukebox. It doesn't matter what dealt most of the damage, as long as the last blow was the arrow of a skeleton. Creepers cannot use doors, but they can climb ladders and vines, unlike other hostile mobs and despite being armless. If a Creeper has been inflicted with a status effect, it will leave that effect behind on the ground, similar to Lingering Potions.Charged Creepers  If struck with lightning, a creeper will become a \"Charged Creeper\". Charged creepers are stronger, and they have a larger blast radius than a normal creeper. They also have a visible, electric aura surrounding them. Attack Strength:Strategy  Creepers can be somewhat formidable foes when encountered as their stealth gives them the upper hand. Creepers are slow, and they will also reverse their detonation time if a player leaves their range. This can be used to a player's advantage in melee combat. A player can simply hit the creeper with their Sword and then quickly back away before the creeper detonates which lets a player get at least two hits in before having to retreat. If this process is repeated, a creeper can be easily defeated. This is easily done by all players, even those who have started a new world. The most effective and safest way to eliminate a creeper is to simply use a bow as ranged combat will surmount the creeper's slow speed. A player would need at least three arrows with a regular bow; however, this can be minimized with enchantments. Another effective way is to light the ground on fire with a Flint and Steel and lead the creeper up to it.Tips  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Trivia References Iron Golem  [view] \u2022 [talk] Iron Golems are tough utility Mobs, built with four Blocks of Iron and one Carved Pumpkin or Jack o' Lantern. They are immune to drowning, fall damage, and knockback. Iron golems will naturally spawn in Villages with at least 21 Doors and 10 villagers. Iron golems are better known for being created by players, and can be created by building a vertical T of 4 iron blocks, and then placing a carved pumpkin on top.Slaying  Iron golems drop 3-5 iron ingots and 0-2 poppies on death; however, when a player kills an iron golem, a player's popularity in a village will decrease by -5. If the popularity level is below -15, natural iron golems will try to attack and kill a player. This does not apply to player-made golems.Behavior  Iron golems will become aggressive against any nearby hostile or neutral mob other than creepers or wolves. They will attack anything that attacks themselves or a Villager, except a player if the iron golem is player-made. A golem will only stop acting aggressively if they defeat a player or mob who attacked them, or if all players leave the game. If the village is near a large pool of water or the ocean, the iron golem will go in the water and stay in it until it dies. They may give the small villagers a Poppy Flower.Trivia Sword  Swords are weapons that are primarily used to kill mobs or players quicker than punching them with the bare hands. They also remove some blocks faster than using a player's bare hands (such as leaves, vines, and melons, though especially cobwebs). Each broken block counts as two uses on the sword's Durability when used in this way.Different Names Overview  The sword is a short-range weapon. Despite its appearance, it grants no range advantage over any other tool since Beta 1.9, including bare hands. Swords were previously used to block attacks up until The Combat Update, where Shields replaced sword-blocking. The durability and damage dealt depends on what material the sword was crafted of: gold being the lowest durability, Diamond being the highest. A player cannot break/mine anything with this weapon. Swords used to inflict more damage than bows, often significantly more, depending on material. Even a wooden sword was on par with an arrow. However, since the Adventure Update update, there are no (non-enchanted) swords that match a full-charged Arrow (with a non-critical hit). A way to use swords without being hit, thus closing the gap between swords and bows, is to dig a trench such that a player's head is the same level as the mob's feet. A player must of course have blocks over his head so that mobs do not come into the trench. It is then possible to hit mobs without them seeing a player: this prevents mobs from retaliating. This method is efficient when defending a fortified building, but is nearly useless when exploring except for whenever a player encounters the 2-block wide spider. High-damage swords are primarily advantageous because they kill mobs in fewer hits, defeating them faster and thereby reducing the chance of the Player being damaged in return. For the same reason, a player will swing these swords fewer times in the long run, reducing the rate at which durability is expended. Unless a player engages in combat very frequently, swords in general will see a far longer useful life. A diamond sword's damage of 8 HP over the iron sword's 7 HP is also a much bigger difference than the difference between the numbers may imply as it guarantees a kill of any mortal thing in fewer hits, and any passive mob in one. The ability to kill rapidly is of greatest benefit against Creepers and Ghasts when the time to act may be very short. These factors combined make a diamond sword a compelling investment. The weaker swords are not recommended for Creeper combat (especially on normal or hard), and there are strong arguments for using a bow, owing to its range (provided the bow is at full charge). If a player approaches a creeper with a sword, a recommended strategy is to use hit-and-run tactics. Hit the creeper and run away until the hissing stops, then run forward and hit it again, as many times as necessary. With a diamond sword, however, one may simply charge at the creeper whilst swinging it, as the 2-hit-kill allows a player to kill the creeper prior to their \"fuse\" running out. Be wary, as this is a risky tactic that could go horribly wrong if failed, often ultimately leading to the demise of a player or items and terrain around them. With the ability to sprint added in Beta 1.8, swords became a more effective tool in combat. When a mob is hit by a player when sprinting, they are sent flying several blocks back because the momentum is added to the mob's momentum. This is quite useful when fighting creepers, especially when a player has little to no armor. Charge at them in a sprint and hit them. They get knocked back to a safe distance before they could even initiate their self-destruct countdown. Simply repeat until the creeper dies. Just make sure there is room behind the creeper and that it does not get knocked back into an obstacle for maximum effectiveness. This tactic basically eliminates the need to run backwards before going for another hit. This tactic is not recommended for tight areas such as caverns and other tight spaces. Only do this when encountering a creeper in the open. A sword with the Knockback enchantment is also viable for the hit-and-run tactic, as it sends any mob flying back a few blocks when hit. This can replace sprinting, or even complement it, resulting in a greater effect. If a diamond sword is being used, this can make creeper disposal very easy. Along with the sprint tactic, this is not recommended for use against Skeletons, Blazes, or any ranged mob, as it grants them a free shot while being approached. Players are advised to make use of the critical hit ability of the sword to dispatch mobs, especially creepers, quickly. These hits add 50% of the sword's base damage but strength, but does not affect enchantments. Note that while sprinting, critical hits cannot be performed. As of Beta 1.8, swords are able to block attacks by holding the right click button. This will block arrows as well as other projectiles, but will reduce a player to a speed slower than sneaking. Swords and all other player-dealt damage were also reduced by half a heart in the beta 1.8 update (like before Beta 1.5), but was increased by 1 HP in release 1.6. Wooden swords can be put in furnaces as fuel, smelting 1 item per sword. Iron and gold swords can be smelted down for iron and gold nuggets, respectively.Sources  Iron swords appear in some Strongholds and Village blacksmith Chests; gold chests appear in some Nether Fortress chests; and enchanted iron and diamond swords can be found in End City chests. Weapon Smith Villagers sell enchanted iron and diamond swords for about 10 and 14 emeralds, respectively. Alternatively, wooden, stone, iron, gold, and diamond swords can be craftedCombat  A sword is a melee weapon - a weapon that can only be used in close combat. Because of this, they aren't recommended for fighting creepers, skeletons, or ghasts. A player can swing a sword by left-clicking while holding it. One good way to deal with these or any other hostile mobs is to run to them, strike them with the sword, then run back and repeat until they are defeated. A player could also hit critical strikes on the mobs by jumping and striking it with the sword on the way down. As of Beta 1.8, a player could block an attack with a sword by right-clicking while holding it. While doing this, a player will take half the damage of the attack. They could also be enchanted using an enchantment table to increase their advantage, and can have abilities added to them by using an Anvil and an Enchanted Book.Enchantments  Here is a list of possible sword enchantments:Trivia The End  The End is an alternate dimension that was introduced in the Beta 1.9 pre-releases. The End is inhabited by\u00a0Endermen, Shulkers, and an Ender Dragon.Getting to The End  To gain access to the End, a player must first locate a rare End Portal, which leads to this realm. Due to the large scale of a Minecraft world, End portals are nearly impossible to stumble upon by chance, as they are located in randomly-generated Strongholds deep underground. To find an End portal, a player needs to acquire and use one or more  Eyes of Ender. This is a craftable item, created by combining  Blaze Powder and an  Ender Pearl. The End portal can be located by throwing an eye of ender into the air (by right-clicking while holding the item),\u00a0which will send it flying through the air and other Blocks until it eventually falls down.\u00a0A player will need to throw multiple eyes of ender and pick them up. Multiple are needed, because there is a 1/5 chance the eye of ender will break and vanish. It will likely take multiple throws to become close to a stronghold, indicated when an eye of ender hovers in one place after being thrown. Use each throw to get the general direction in which to go, and travel a fair distance before throwing it again. Once a player finds the End portal within the stronghold, a player must repair it with several more eyes of ender. Activating the End portal requires 12 eyes of ender, however, there is a possibility of finding some eyes of ender inside of chests in the stronghold. It is best to be prepared with a surplus of eyes of ender before journeying forth. The 12 eyes of ender must be placed in the End Portal Frames surrounding the End portal. Once all 12 are in place, the portal will become active. By jumping into the portal, a player will be teleported to The End.Geography  The End consists of several large islands within a black void. There is plenty of Obsidian, End Stone and special blocks known as Ender Crystals which heal the Ender Dragon.Inner End  As soon as a player enters the End, a long purple bar (health) can be seen on top of the screen. This indicates the health of the Ender Dragon flying above (unless a player has already killed it previously). A player will spawn in a random location, sometimes in a small room underground, surrounded by end stone. There are\u00a0tall pillars of obsidian scattered throughout the End. These pillars have ender crystals on top of them that will regenerate the Ender Dragon's health when it is nearby. These crystals can be destroyed by hitting them once. However, because they explode upon being destroyed, it is advised to use a Bow and Arrows. They can also be safely destroyed by a thrown Egg or Snowball. After defeating the Ender Dragon, a portal will spawn directly under the spot where it was killed. Stepping through the portal will trigger the End Credits, giving a player the \"The End\" achievement before returning a player to the Overworld at the place of a player's spawn point. Before defeating the Ender Dragon, it is impossible to return to the overworld without dying. That being said, it is most advisable to create a few Ender Chests in which items can be stored, and then accessed from any dimension to avoid losing any important items while destroying the healing crystals.Outer End  In The Combat Update, a new area of The End was made accessible to players. To teleport to this new region of the End, a player must: It is possible to physically build a bridge to the islands of the outer end, but this isn't a viable option, as the gap is around 1000 blocks long. Another way of accessing the islands is by using elytra and firework rockets. The Outer End consists of a number of large islands, with Chorus Plants and End City structures.Trivia The Nether  The Nether is a separate dimension outside of the Overworld, which players can visit. It is also referred to as \"The Nexus\" in Notch's and Jeb's Blog on Tumblr, sometimes called \"Gate to Inferno Fields\" and was previously known as The Slip and Hell (the latter being its current technical name) during the Indev stage.Overview  The Nether was originally added as part of the Halloween Update. It exists in a completely different world from the overworld. The terrain is dimly lit, full of Lava streams flowing from the ceiling, sudden cliffs, and lava lakes, making it extremely dangerous to explore. The ceiling and the base of the Nether are made of Bedrock. Mushrooms are also commonly found. If a player dies in The Nether, they will be transported back to the spawn point in the overworld, while their items stay in the nether for the normal amount of time. Maps can be made of the Nether, but they must be crafted in the Nether. If a player brings a map of the overworld into the Nether, it will stay the same, but the marker that represents a player will be absent. Also, sudden bridges and shafts can be found throughout the randomly generated world. One will most likely find the bridge partially destroyed, and the shaft is located near lots of enemies, so watch out. Always carry weapons, bridge repair kits, and useful renewable items with one. Sometimes, the Nether can be classified as useful or exciting, since one can find large quantities of Soul Sand and Glowstone, and Cacti can grow here. The Nether is also the only place where Nether Quartz can be found.Travel  A Nether Portal is made by creating a 4x5 (2x3 on inside) or larger door frame out of Obsidian and then lighting the inside of the frame on fire with Flint and Steel or a Fire Charge. The corners of the frame may be left out, using only 10 obsidian as opposed to the usual 14. When one stands inside the portal for the first time, it will create a portal in its equivalent area of the Nether. A loading screen will appear during the change of worlds.  A portal can be shut down if part of the obsidian frame is removed (not including corners), or hit by a Ghast's fireball. When re-entering the overworld, any distance covered in the Nether is multiplied by 8, effectively making The Nether a fast-travel zone that allows for greater distances to be covered in a short amount of time in the overworld. One has to stay in a portal. If not, it will not teleport a player. In order to use them, a player has to stand still inside the purple haze. A recent update allowed overworld mobs to go through portals and vice versa. Attempting to go through a portal while in a minecart or on a pig will result in a player needing to restart the game to continue because a player can see permanent purple swirls. The same effects happen in the very buggy Far Lands. A useful way to save obsidian is to create a Nether portal with the ordinary 14 blocks, travel to the Nether, remove the corner bits, then travel back to the overworld and remove the corners there too.Mobs  Most mobs that spawn in the overworld do not spawn in the nether. The only exceptions are the Enderman, Skeleton, and Zombie Pigman (which only appears in the overworld when pigs are struck by lightning). Instead, the nether contains an entirely different list of mobs.Blocks  Blocks can be brought to and from the overworld. So far, there are eight block types only found in the Nether: There are currently 5 blocks that spawn both in the Nether and in the overworld Water cannot be brought to the Nether, and all water placed will evaporate immediately due to the extreme heat, and will instead turn into steam. However, players can place lava and ice blocks in the Nether, but placing an ice block will have no effect. As of current updates, one are no longer able to have ice melt into water. Instead, the block of ice leaves nothing behind upon breaking.Etymology  The Nether's name is derived from the English word \"Ether\", meaning \"In the outer reaches of space or in the heavens\", or \"nowhere known\" + an N. Nether could similarly be derived from a mythical location known as the \"netherworld\", usually depicted as a place where the wicked go when they decease.Survival and Tips Trivia Enchantment Table  The Enchantment Table is used to enchant certain items using Experience Points. Items that can be enchanted include: Swords, Pickaxes, Shovels, Axes, Bows, Books, and Armor. Enchantment tables alone typically have upgrades ranging from two to seven experience levels. If a player is within a certain range, the book on the table will open, face a player, and flip pages every several seconds. As of update 1.8, Lapis Lazuli is required to enchant items. The chance of getting a better enchantment can be increased by placing bookshelves around the table. Only bookshelves that are two blocks away will add enchantments. When placed correctly, an animation of floating symbols moving into the book entity will occur. The text is written in the Standard Galactic Alphabet. The ideal position of bookshelves is a square of 15 placed in a 5x5-block outline, with the enchantment table in the middle.Enchantments  (See the Enchantments article for a complete list).Trivia Pickaxe  A Pickaxe is a Tool used to mine stone-type blocks and ores in any Minecraft world. They are required to gather Stone resources for Crafting and building, as well as gathering mineral resources such as Iron Ore and Coal. Pickaxes can also be used to gather other blocks, but they aren't as effective as the preferred tool type. As with all types of tools, there are various types of Enchantments available for the pickaxe. Of all the tools, the pickaxe is the tool that deals the third-highest amount of damage when compared to other tools of the same composition.Types  Listed from lowest mining strength to highest, the materials are:Speed and Durability  A pickaxe will lose Durability at a faster rate if it is used to attack Mobs, opposed to mining. The reasoning for this is because pickaxes are not meant for combat. The following table shows the time it takes to break each type of block. A block marked with a red background indicates that it cannot be harvested by that certain pickaxe, and the block will be destroyed. A green background indicates the quickest tool type(s) for the corresponding block. Note that some blocks will not drop anything, regardless of the tool used.Trivia Blaze  [view] \u2022 [talk] The Blaze is an uncommon mob with yellow colored skin and black eyes. They first appeared in the Beta 1.9 Pre-release 1 version. These are hostile mobs who are located within The Nether. When a player is spotted, they will set themselves on fire, which does not damage them, and they will then shoot a 3 round-burst type of fireball attacks at a player. They guard Nether fortresses and are usually spawned from a Monster Spawner, but can be found roaming Nether Foretresses. They are easily recognized as a ball of flames, which can help a player notice a blaze before they are noticed. Since a Blaze is on fire, and fire is extinguished by water, Blazes are the only mobs that can be killed with snowballs. Zero to one blaze rods are dropped when killed. Blazes have two attacks. When a player is close, the Blaze hits a player for about 2 hearts of damage. If the Blaze has spotted a player, but a player is too far, the Blaze will shoot a fireball at a player, which ignites on impact.Spawning  Blaze spawners can be found only in Nether fortresses and will start spawning Blazes once a player gets within 16 blocks. The mob spawners have a chance of spawning 1\u20134 Blazes at once. Blazes can only spawn in light level 11 or lower (at the lower half of their body). Blazes can also spawn naturally elsewhere in Nether Fortresses.Behavior  Although Blazes are able to fly, they will stay on the ground or sink down slowly in the air when not attacking. Blazes will attempt to swim upwards in lava, much like regular mobs behave in water. When they see a player, they will start flying and shooting. They will catch fire briefly. A short cool-down period occurs between attacks. In addition to normal weapons, Blazes can be hurt by snowballs, taking 3 (1 1/2 hearts) per hit. If they have found a way into the Overworld, they are also damaged by water and even rain. Water does roughly 1 damage every second. Like all Nether mobs, they are not damaged by fire or lava. If killed by a player, they drop Blaze Rods. They will attack each other if one blaze hits another, just like Skeletons. On the Xbox 360/PS3 version, Blazes do not catch fire when either attacked in Creative mode or when they have spotted a player. They also do not make fireball sounds, making it hard to find where they're coming from. They also drop glowstone dust on occasion, as well as their blaze rods. This makes glowstone a renewable resource on the Xbox/PS3.Strategy  Blazes are considerably difficult mobs to fight, due to their ranged attacks and rapid rate of fire. Their ability to fly usually leaves a player's sword useless, while charging a bow leaves a player vulnerable. Their flight also can make it tricky to collect their loot. One response is to use a fishing rod to reel them in. Another is to run behind a corner and ambush them once they get close, or place blocks to take cover between attacks as they advance. However, as of 1.9 and the addition of shields, the fireballs can be completely negated. If surrounded, however, it is difficult even with a shield as the blazes can shoot from different angles, nullifying the shield. The use of fire resistance is extremely helpful when fighting Blazes, as their attacks usually wind up dealing more fire damage than initial impact. While fire protection can absorb a lot of damage, total fire resistance is necessary to shrug off the hail of fire. For a player's first Blaze fight, they can make a shield and bow, which are very cheap, needing only three string, three sticks (bow), and six wood and one iron ingot (shield). Enchanted Golden Apples can be an effective way of encountering blazes for the first time, but they are no longer craftable in vanilla Minecraft, so a player will have to rely on their seldom occurrences in chests. Snowballs are deadly to Blazes, doing 3 points of damage apiece, and snowballs can be thrown a lot more quickly than a bow can be charged up. Plus, snow is easy to find in any snowy biome and is even renewable, therefore allowing easy obtaining. In case inventory is tight, snow blocks can be used to store snowballs 16 times more efficiently. However, a shovel is necessary to re-obtain the snowballs. Wolves do not do well against Blazes. Besides the monster's high health, they tend to get set afire (splash potions of fire resistance can help). If they are used, bring extra wolves, and plenty of rotten flesh or other meat to heal them. (Zombie Pigmen drop rotten flesh, although attacking Zombie Pigmen is a very dangerous thing to do.) On a positive note, wolf kills do get blaze drops and experience. Iron Golems can be used to kill blazes, but there are several drawbacks: 'Camping' at a Blaze spawner is an effective way to gather Blaze Rods, as they will always appear close enough to attack with a sword, and there is a delay in their attack after they spawn because they have to charge first. This is best done in combination with the fire resistance potions in effect. A blaze farm can be built in several ways in several ways. A good method is to construct a box around the entire spawn zone (tip: the fences around the spawner are not far enough away). Another would be to make a doorway to kill them as they come down, or a single hole in the bottom where they can be shot from. Again, stay within 16 blocks of the spawner to keep it going. A trap for them can be made by digging a shelter under their balcony, then mine a 1\u00d73 hole up to their balcony. Sometimes, a natural version of this will appear, when a narrow staircase leads up to the spawner room. Another good way to hunt Blazes is to use a melee approach that exploits a Blaze's attack cycle: The blaze will \"burn\" for a few seconds, then fire three, and only three, fire charges. If a player is not in line of sight, the Blaze will delay its attack until they are, and eventually, the Blaze will itself move into line of sight and fire. After firing, they need to wait a few seconds before they can fire again. Blazes are an efficient way to farm experience. They drop 10 experience points when killed by a player, as opposed to only 5 dropped by most other hostile mobs. The above camping method, combined with potions of fire resistance, can generate an average of about 65 experience per minute.Trivia Gallery Giant  [view] \u2022 [talk] A Giant, or Giant Zombie, is an extremely large, hostile mob. Their model first appeared in Survival Test, but was abandoned. Giants were originally neutral mobs, and did not attack a Player without incite. This was likely due to their near-boss physique and health. They have the same appearance as a zombie, but are six times larger. Before their AI was removed in 1.8, their only method of attack was to charge endlessly at a player. Giants have 50 hearts total, half of the Ender Dragon's, but still equally deadly. They are capable of being spawned with the  command (since 1.7), and third-party programs such as SinglePlayerCommands (SPC), but they cannot spawn naturally, due to requiring a light level of both greater than 11 and less than 8. They can ride in minecarts, which will cause a bug where the giant appears to levitate above the minecart while sitting on nothing. The hitbox on the model itself only includes the giant's legs, waist and stomach; any attacks that make contact above this point will not cause damage, or even hit it. Giants have made a re-introduction into Minecraft, however, they still cannot be created naturally. In snapshot 13w36a, giants can be summoned via the  command and mods. In addition to Minecraft: Java Edition, they were in the Xbox 360 release. However, their AI is removed, and right now they can only be spawned with their spawn egg (which can only be obtained via external modifications). Trying to spawn a giant with a spawn egg will crash the game (except in the Xbox 360 release).Video  The following video was made by Notch, testing out giants on February 4, 2010.Survival Mode Guide  This page is for the casual player who wants a nice simple outline of what steps must be taken to thrive. There will not be in depth information on \"completing\" the game of Minecraft on here, as there is already a much more in depth explanation and plan on the original page. Again, this is for a player who just wants to know how to get started and use Minecraft to pass the time. Survival Mode\u00a0is a\u00a0game mode where\u00a0a player must survive by building and altering the terrain to fulfill one's needs all the while keeping an eye on the ever present Health Bar and Hunger Bar. Depending on what difficulty\u00a0one chooses to play in, the danger of either one depleting to life-threatening levels arises.\u00a0The objective of the game is to survive and armed with only one's right hand. It will be difficult to do so for much time without acquiring necessary resources. The ideal progression of actions is as follows: From here on, it is up to one what one do. One can explore the world and build amazing structures. One can keep to one central point and create a self-sufficient little haven. One can even try one's luck at going through the whole game to its \"end\". One decide what one make of this near infinite world.Trivia See also Snow Golem  [view] \u2022 [talk] Snow Golems, also known as Snowmen, are a unique type of passive Mobs that are created by a player. As they walk, they leave snow trails in their wake. In cold and cool biomes, it'll happen at any elevation; in warm biomes, it will typically only occur above sea level. It is also fair to note that snow golems will take damage when it rains (but not when it snows), and in any hot biome (i.e. the nether, deserts, mesas, savannas, and jungles). Upon death, they drop only Snowballs, meaning that no pumpkin will be dropped as used in the creation. Making a snow golem consists of 2 Snow Blocks and a carved pumpkin. Place the two blocks of snow on top of each other, and the carved pumpkin at last on top, and the snow golem will be created.Behavior  Snow golems wander aimlessly until a hostile mob is seen, after which they will throw snowballs at it. Snowballs do not do damage, but anger the mob, thus diverting the enemy's attention. The mobs will then attack the snow golem until it is dead. Snow golems can only hurt blazes since blazes can be killed by throwing snowballs at them.Weaknesses  As previously stated, snow golems will take damage from any form of water, similar to endermen. However, they cannot survive in the nether, jungle biomes, or desert biomes because of the heat. A fire resistance potion will render them immune to these biomes, however.How to Build  To create a snow golem, a player must stack two snow blocks on the ground, then place a pumpkin on top of it. This does not require a crafting table. An alternative for carved pumpkins can be a Jack-O-Lantern. Note that when building it, the pumpkin must be put on last. This makes snow golems impossible to generate via redstone-affected items. Also, note that they can be created in the Xbox 360 Edition\u00a0as of a recent update.\u00a0However, only 8 of them can be created at a time.Trivia Villager  [view] \u2022 [talk] Villagers, formerly known as Testificates, are human passive Non-Player Characters (NPCs) that spawn and move around in Villages and sometimes igloos. They have different roles, such as Priests, Butchers, Tool Smiths, Weapon Smiths, Leatherworkers, Clerics, Farmers, Shepherds, Nitwit, and librarians and spawn in their respective buildings. They possess large heads, green eyes, uni-brows, and long, Squidward-like noses. You can also trade with villagers but each villager with each role trades different stuff.Behavior  Villagers are considered as one of the most intelligent of all peaceful mobs. However, there are some factors that they are unaware of or pay no attention to. Villagers realize the day-night cycle as well. Villagers are not fond of Water, and unlike the other peaceful mobs, will immediately attempt to find an escape route. Villagers will attempt to avoid zombies. However, they do not attempt to escape any attackers except zombies. Unlike other mobs, villagers do not notice when they are set on Fire, making any source of fire extremely dangerous to a village's population. Villagers will not run when they are on fire as well, showing no attempt to put the fire out. Villagers spawn in either villages which can be located only in the flattest (or close to flat) Biomes, such as desert biomes, savannas, and plains, or in igloo basements. When a villager notices a zombie, they immediately begin to run away from them. Villagers are fast enough to escape a zombie, Zombie Villager, Zombie Pigman, or husk. However, this will not always protect them, and a baby zombie will outrun them. When it becomes night time, all villagers move in-doors to safety. However, there is a flaw in this behavior. Whenever it is raining outside, villagers still realize it as day. Zombies, however, will not die because it is raining, and the sun is not out. This can cause some villagers to die. Villagers will also run away when they see a Vindicator, Evoker or an Illusioner. A common sight in a village would be villagers facing each other, assuming the human-like characteristic of \"talking\". When a player attacks a villager, they have steam coming from their heads, most-likely indicating anger or frustration. As of 1.6, villagers will produce noises (sounding similar to a \"hmmm\", a grunt, or a humming sound). They make noises on several occasions: when Breeding is activated, when struck by a player, or when a player trades with one. Villagers also can pick up food, and share it to other villagers. They will pick up wheat, bread, carrots, potatoes, and beetroots. All villagers will additionally pick up seeds and beetroot seeds but only Farmer Villagers will actually plant them (giving seeds to a non-farmer villager is only useful for disposing of excess seeds). Once a villager has enough food, and there are\u00a0enough doors in the village, villagers will begin to breed. In the Bedrock Edition, villagers will run away from the player, and anger particles will not appear, even close to a village, unless the player looks at its trading interface. Also, farmer villagers can be seen holding certain farm items like carrots and drop them to give them to other villagers.Trading  Villagers are able to be traded with in the game for various Items depending on their \"profession\" or type of villager. The currency that they handle are Emeralds. Some villagers will trade for emeralds, while others will take emeralds and give items. Farmer type villagers, known for their brown clothing, are known to trade items related to farming, such as wheat, carrots, Potatoes, and melon seeds for emeralds, or vice versa. Farmers tend to occupy farms and plant a new crop and take out the full-grown food. The Butcher type, known for the brown clothing and white apron, will trade for meat such as porkchops, beef, mutton, and chicken. It is far more common for the trade to require the raw version of the meat. Priests, which can be recognized by their full magenta clothing, trade for Ender Pearls and Eyes of Ender. They also allow a player to buy enchanted items by trading an unenchanted version of the item, in addition to a few emeralds as the cost of enchanting the item. One of the most common trades this particular villager offers is the Rotten Flesh for an emerald. The Blacksmith type of villager trades for armor and tools and weapons. The Librarian villager is known for his all white clothing and \"smart\" look, buys paper and sells books and navigational related items, such as bookshelves and compasses. Lastly there is one other villager called the Nitwit, it wears a green robe and does not trade when one right clicks him. Villagers all start with one trade agreement. Once a player does this trade and then closes the trading interface, the villager will have a \"thinking\" type animation and come up with another trade. This does two things. First, it allows more trading options, up to a maximum of 5 per villager, and second, it resets the trade. Each trade will be able to be used 7 times until it must be reset again. The villager will only reset if the final or \"newest\" trade is completed at least one time. Once all five are unlocked, continuing the last trade will continue to reset the trades, and also has a small chance of replacing an existing trade with a new one. Trading is one of the fastest ways to get emeralds legitimately in Survival (Game mode) without the use of cheats, as farming animals and crops are far faster than digging for emeralds. This allows players to constantly trade and renew trades that yield emeralds to a player. This is also known sometimes as \"farming emeralds\", or \"emerald bartering.\" As of Minecraft 1.8, the villagers' trading got a complete overhaul. Villagers could now have several trades when they are spawned giving a player more flexibility when trading. Another factor that helps is that when trading, new trade possibilities can occur depending on how many new trades players have made already. The Exploration Update added new \"Cartographer\" villagers, who will trade their Exploration Map for a compass and varied amounts of Emeralds gathered by a player.Popularity  A player's popularity within a particular village can be increased or decreased in many ways, with one notable consequence: if a player has a popularity below -15, naturally spawned Iron Golems will become permanently hostile towards a player. Popularity can be gained by trading, breeding, etc., but will decrease by attacking\u00a0villagers\u00a0and/or\u00a0iron golems. A player's popularity can be high in one village, yet low in another. Actions which decrease a player's popularity are as follows:Variants Illagers  Illagers are hostile, villager-like mobs. There are 3 types: the evoker, vindicator, and illusioner. All illagers will attack villagers and iron golems. The evoker and vindicator spawn in Woodland Mansions while the illsuioner is unused.Witches  Witches are hostile villager like mobs that are much like illagers. They spawn rarely in the overworld in low light levels, or by a Witch hut. Witches will also spawn if a villager is struck by lightning. They will not attack villagers, but will attack iron golems.NPC  NPC's are villager like mobs who are exclusive to the Education Edition. They provide tips and come in several different looks. Despite strongly resembling villagers like the other variants, NPCs do not trade, but right clicking opens their \"speech\" interface.Zombie Villager  [view] \u2022 [talk] Zombie Villagers are aggressive mobs that appeared in Minecraft's Pretty Scary Update (Version 1.4). They make up 5% of zombies that spawn in the Overworld. They will also appear after a villager is killed by a zombie during a village siege, 50% on Normal and 100% on Hard. If a baby villager is killed during a siege, it will also become a baby zombie villager. Baby zombie villagers are faster than their grown-up counterparts and will not age. Zombie villagers can be cured and\u00a0returned to normal villagers if weakened using a splash potion of weakness, and then fed a Golden Apple. They will appear to shudder while being cured. It is best to place zombie villagers in a sort of \"prison cell\" structure with a bed and iron bars while curing it. This is because the iron bars and bed make the villager cure about 4% faster. Zombie villagers take 2\u20135 minutes to cure under normal circumstances. A zombie villager has all the behaviors and characteristics of regular zombies, such as being able to wear armor, but when equipping mob heads, the nose tends to get in the way. In the Pocket Edition, zombie villagers do not spawn with armor, nor does it show, unless it is a chestplate, which is basically a rectangle that appears in the inner part of the zombie villager's torso. It can be seen by simply looking through a hole in the zombie villager's tattered clothing. Iron golems will still attack them, unless they are cured. In Pocket Edition and 1.9, they retain their clothes and appearance prior to being infected.\u00a0Trivia See Also  Illager Witch NPCList of Items Blocks  Blocks are different types of items in Minecraft.\u00a0 Blocks are placeable, unlike most other items (without the use of an item frame). They make up the in-game environments, and they can be collected and utilized in many different ways. Some blocks spawns naturally, such as Dirt or Stone while other blocks, such as Bricks and Redstone Lamps, must be crafted by a player. Most people would say that Wood is one of the most helpful blocks due to its widespread use. All player-made structures are created using a variety of blocks or just one. Certain blocks have special uses, for example, Jack-O-Lanterns, Glowstone, Sea Lanterns, and redstone lamps can be used to light underwater areas since they cannot be put out by water. Just make sure that the redstone signal isn't destroyed with redstone lamps. There are three different transparency levels of blocks. There are completely transparent blocks, such as Air. There are semi-transparent blocks, such as Glass and Leaves. There are also opaque blocks, such as Wood or Cobblestone. Most blocks that are at least somewhat transparent will not be able to have Torches placed on them. The face of a block is 16\u00d716 pixels, and each block is proportionately one cubic meter. Most blocks are static, although water, Lava, Portal, and Fire blocks have a shifting pattern. While the default texture pack's textures have 16 by 16 block faces, there are texture packs with 32x32 or even 64x64 textures. These texture packs often require a mod. But usually they just require the default Minecraft texture pack.World-generated Blocks  Entries marked with a  require additional data values to entirely define the block in a Minecraft world. Entries marked with an  have a different ID as an inventory item. Entries marked with a  require additional inventory data to fully define the inventory item. Entries marked with a  have tile entities associated with them to store additional data. Items with IDs in red cannot be legitimately obtained by a player in the game. They can only be obtained by \"hacking\" (Such as using an inventory editor) or while in multiplayer servers, or by using the /give command. Items available only in Creative mode are in blue. Items only obtainable through the Silk Touch enchantment in Survival Mode are in green.The Overworld  Below is a list of blocks that can be obtained in the overworld.Naturally Generated  Naturally generated blocks include blocks that are created through a 'seed' either player generated or generated by a random seed generator.Naturally Created  Naturally created means a combination of events that cause a new block to be placed by natural causes and NOT by the player.Structures  Same as naturally generated, but these blocks are only created with the \"Generate Structures\" option enabled. The most pack of blocks is 64.The Nether  To get to the Nether, one must obtain at least 10 obsidian Blocks from the overworld, a result from the collision of water with still lava, and arrange the obsidian in a 4x5 formation (with any block, including air, making up the corners). Once fire is added, one can travel to the Nether.Naturally Generated Naturally Created Additional Reading  There are currently 153 different types of blocks, including air, which cannot be built, still water, still lava, various types of wood, various colors of wool, various types of pressure plates, slabs, stairs and Double Slabs. See Data Values for the full list. In a standard randomly generated world, one can find air, stone, grass, snow, dirt, water, water source, lava, lava source, sand, sandstone, gravel, gold ore, iron ore, diamond ore, redstone ore, lapis lazuli ore, clay block, coal ore, bedrock, ice, wood, birch wood, wooden planks, etc. In Abandoned Mines pine/spruce wood, leaves, cacti, sugar cane, vines, pumpkins, dandelions, poppies, brown and red Mushrooms, dead bushes, shrubs and tall grass. In Dungeons (added in Seecret Friday Update 2), one can also find cobblestone, mossy cobblestone, a monster spawner and chests, even though cobblestone and chests are usually made by a player. Cobblestone, wooden planks, fences, pressure plates, bookshelves, crafting tables, stairs, torches, black wool, glass panes, iron bars, lava, chests and furnaces may also be found in the randomly generated NPC Villages that were added in Beta 1.8, and stone bricks, Mossy Stone Bricks, Cracked Stone Bricks, iron bars, end portal frames, monster spawners, bookshelves, wooden planks, fences, chests and cobwebs can be found in the Strongholds and Abandoned Mineshafts also added in Beta 1.8. Obsidian can be found naturally, but it is not part of the random generation. Instead, it is created when naturally occurring lava source blocks and water come in contact. Cobblestone can also be found naturally, and is formed with the same circumstances as obsidian, except that it is formed when water and moving lava contact. Dungeons are also built of cobblestone in parts. In the initial, free version of survival, a player began with 10 TNT blocks, and they could obtain dirt, cobblestone from stone, wooden planks from wood, Gold Blocks from gold ore, Iron Blocks from iron ore, stone slabs from coal ore and white wool from Sheep. In Classic mode a player can build with naturally occurring blocks (except for Redstone and Diamond), and can use bookcase, Sponge, colored wool, brick, obsidian and moss stone. Operators of servers can also place bedrock. Some custom servers give the ability to place grass and (still) Fluids, too. When playing the current version, a player can craft a variety of blocks not naturally found in maps, including crafting tables, bookshelves, furnaces, etc. Redstone, diamond, Gold and Lapis Lazuli can be found in the lower areas of maps. Netherrack, glowstone, gravel, soul sand, nether brick, nether brick fence, nether brick stairs and nether wart can be found in The Nether, which a player can only enter by creating a Nether Portal, and end stone and obsidian can be found in the End, which a player can only enter by inserting eyes of ender in all the end portal frames. Bedrock, torches, an End portal, an End gateway and a dragon egg are created after beating the Ender Dragon. The Pocket Edition has 3 additional blocks: the Cyan Flower, Nether Reactor Core and Glowing Obsidian.See also Trivia References Human  [view] \u2022 [talk] Humans were non-playable characters (NPCs) taking the form of clones of a player (the default skin). They spawned when 'G' was pressed while playing in Classic mode, but this function was later removed in Survival Test. If a player has a custom skin, any humans created will still use default skin and will not assume the look of a player. Humans could not create nor break blocks, and would only move around the map aimlessly, walking in slightly imperfect circles and jumping occasionally. Humans were only affected by solid blocks, but strangely not fluids, walking through them as if they were air. Humans were only spawned by pressing G in the Pre-Classic, and later by map editiors. Today humans can only be spawned by mods.Appearance  Humans had brown hair and rather peculiarly purple eyes. They had exactly the same clothing as a Player and Zombies.Behaviour  Humans could not create or delete blocks, but will wander around the map in circles, or occasianally jump around. A human may choose to attack players like zombies.History Trivia References Diamond Ore  Diamond Ore is an ore for a rare gem, diamond, which is one of the most valuable resources for tools and armor found in Minecraft.Overview  Immediately after mining the block, a player acquires a diamond, rather than the ore itself. Diamond can be used to make very strong tools and durable armor. However, diamonds are quite hard to find, and are usually located from 0 to 16 layers above the bedrock level. To mine diamond ore, a player will need an iron or diamond pickaxe. To obtain the diamond ore block, it must be mined with an iron pickaxe or higher with the Silk Touch enchantment on it. Often, a player will encounter underground dungeons while digging, and can loot chests within to find diamonds and other ores.Mining  Diamond ores appear at layers 7\u201313, and sometimes can be found at bedrock layer. There are many popular and efficient ways to find diamond. One such way is to randomly dig around Layer 10, and depending on a player's luck, they will get 16\u201334 diamonds with 8\u201310 iron pickaxes being used and destroyed. It is also a good idea to enchant the pickaxe with Unbreaking or Efficiency before a player starts to dig. Mining a diamond ore itself requires the silk touch enchantment. The ore can later be excavated with a pickaxe with a fortune I, II, or III enchantment for a chance to get more diamonds.Trivia Ender Pearl  Ender Pearls\u00a0are items that were added in the 1.8 Beta Adventure Update. They are occasionally dropped by Endermen upon death, and they are a crucial component in locating and accessing The End.Uses  As of the Beta 1.9 pre-release 2, it is possible to throw an Ender Pearl by right-clicking while it is in a player's hand in order to teleport to its impact location, causing  (2.5) damage to the user in the process. This is classified as fall damage, so the Feather Falling enchantment will lessen the damage taken. When an Ender Pearl is thrown, a player will be unable to throw another one for one second (shown by a white overlay). Upon teleporting, a player is briefly surrounded by the same particles generated by Endermen when they teleport for a few seconds.  Ender Pearls are a necessary item needed to reach The End. An Ender Pearl can be used to craft an  Eye of Ender by combining it with a  Blaze Powder. Eyes of Ender can be thrown into the air and if they are followed, they will eventually lead the user to the location of the End Portal. Once at the portal, up to twelve Eyes of Ender are also required to activate it.Trivia Pigmen  [view] \u2022 [talk] A Pigman is a pig in a humanoid form that originally were going to inhabit villages. Although not implemented, their skin can be found within the game files, and their counterpart, zombie pigmen, have been part of The Nether since the Minecraft Alpha 1.2.0 Halloween Update. It has the same dimensions as a Player, and has no coding present within the game that spawns it. Although a pigman could be made from a pig getting hit by lightning in earlier versions, the feature has been since removed.History  Minecraft user Miclee made up the idea for Pigmen. He was given the Bacon Cape as a reward. However, when Notch was asked for personal capes by other users, the Bacon Cape was taken away from Miclee to prevent further commotion. Notch mentioned April 25, 2011 that he might add Pigmen as NPC villages' townspeople. In Beta 1.9 Pre-releases, a different villager mob was introduced. Regular pig models were changed in Beta 1.8 to have a protruding snout. Whether this will be applied to Pigmen or Zombie Pigmen in the future is unknown, although possibly unlikely due to the fact stated above of sharing the same shape as other entities.Trivia See also References ", "Wiki Minecraft": "Wiki Minecraft Crafting  Crafting is a game mechanic in Minecraft that allows players to place materials in a grid to create\u00a0useful items and blocks.Overview  Players will be able to access a small 2x2 crafting grid in their Inventory. Simple items and blocks can be crafted using this grid. However, a crafting table must be used in order to craft most items and blocks. Once a player constructs a crafting table using planks\u00a0(four wooden planks in a 2x2 square), he/she is able to construct more advanced items/blocks such as tools, chests and furnaces. The crafting table has a larger 3x3 crafting grid and the ability to create tools and weapons. Some items/blocks take more time and effort to gather resources for than others.Crafting Process  In order to craft objects successfully, a player must make a shape of the desired object in the crafting grid. When a player has successfully arranged the materials in the right order within the grid, the object to be produced will appear in a separate, single box of the crafting interface, where a player may pick it up and place it in their inventory. In the Minecraft: Xbox 360 Edition, Minecraft: Xbox One Edition and Minecraft: Pocket Edition, the interface tells a player all the ingredients needed to craft the object in question while in the PC version a player must find out the recipes on their own without the recipe book, but the recipe book was added to PC in the 1.12 update. In the Xbox 360 and Xbox One editions, there is an option for \"classic crafting\" which makes the crafting interface more like the PC version's crafting interface when enabled. A crafting table is the main tool for crafting. It is impossible to succeed in Minecraft without the use of a crafting table as it is needed to create: Pickaxes, Armor, weapons, furnaces and most other items/blocks. In the Minecraft: PlayStation 4 Edition and other console editions, the items needed to craft an object are displayed in the crafting grid without the need of recipes. This makes the crafting grid more of a visual 'ingredient' list. This was likely added so that casual players could enjoy the game without spending a lot of time learning recipes as well as to lessen the already-high learning curve. Another possibility is that it is difficult to quickly move items around the inventory crafting grid by using a controller alone (even with the touch-pad, it is still not as easy as using a computer mouse).Mobs  Mobs are living game entities that are affected by physics and can interact with Players or other mobs.Overview  Mobs can be divided into three behavioral categories: Passive, Neutral and Hostile. Some mobs will change their behavior in response to certain situations (eg. if they are attacked). Mobs usually drop items and Experience Points when killed, with Hostile and \"boss\" mobs tending to drop rarer and higher-quality items.Mob Types Utility  Utility mobs are those which are created by players. They can protect players and villagers from hostile mobs (with the exception of Creepers). They usually attack hostile mobs, but in certain situations, can attack any type of mob or player. A notable exception is The Wither, which attacks all mobs except those considered undead.Passive  Passive mobs are harmless to players, and some will flee if attacked. they often provide beneficial items for players, if the right tool is used (eg. Shears to collect Wool or a Bucket to collect Milk). Some mobs become passive only after they are tamed. Like utility mobs, they can also protect a player from hostile mobs.Neutral  Neutral mobs will attack a player only when provoked. However, they can sometimes attack other mobs as well.Hostile  Hostile mobs will attack a player when he/she gets within a certain range. For most hostile mobs, the range is typically 16 blocks, without any obstructions. Some mobs can sense a player from much farther away, like Ghasts, who detect all players within 100 blocks.Boss  A \"boss\" mob is a special type of hostile mob that has more health than most, a larger detection range, and triggers a health bar and name to appear at the top of a player's screen when they are within range.Unused  Unused mobs exist in the Minecraft source code, but cannot be spawned in default survival mode, without the use of Commands.Education Edition  These mobs only exist in the Education Edition version of Minecraft.Unimplemented  Unimplemented mobs may have been planned for a past update, but do not currently exist within Minecraft.Removed  Removed mobs no longer exist in modern Minecraft, but can be encountered in older versions of the game.Trivia Ender Dragon  [view] \u2022 [talk] The Ender Dragon is a hostile boss mob that appears in The End. She is a dragon creature that spits fire and can fly with ease.Overview  Since Beta 1.9 pre-release 6, a single ender dragon appears in each world's End, and can be fought and killed. She swoops at a player, destroying any blocks she passes through, except Obsidian, indestructible blocks (such as Bedrock), Iron Bars, and End Stone. Once an ender dragon is killed, an End Gateway appears in the vicinity, with a dragon egg on top. The end gateway leads to the \"Outer End\". Upon defeat, the ender dragon performs an exploding animation and drops around 12,000 Experience Orbs (which take a player with no experience to around level 78), activates the Exit Portal, and spawns a dragon egg on top of the portal frame. When one Ender Crystal is placed on each edge of the exit portal\u2014for a total of 4\u2014then the dragon will respawn. However, when defeated, she drops a lot less experience and no dragon egg.Appearance  The ender dragon is a large, black dragon with glowing purple eyes. She is the second-largest mob in the game. Only the unimplemented giant is larger. She has a few dark gray features, such as the wings, and various other parts of her body. Similar to the eyes of endermen and Spiders, the ender dragon's eyes are visible through darkness, so a player can see her coming from anywhere in The End.Behavior  Ender dragons attack by charging at a player's lower waist, with their wings tucked in and diving downward. If hit with anything while swooping towards a player, even a fist, she will turn around and fly away. Ender crystals that sit on top of the obsidian towers will heal her. The ender dragon flies around the sky and shoots purple fire charges (Ender Acid). After a while, she will go down and hover above the inactive End Portal while constantly spraying ender acid out of her mouth, similar to how a dragon breathes fire when attacking.Strategy  Here are a few tips for fighting the dragon:Trivia Enderman  [view] \u2022 [talk] An Enderman is a Minecraft mob who, when a Player looks above its legs, will attack that player (with the only exception being if the player wears a Pumpkin), has long legs, purple eyes and can also pick up Blocks and move them around.Appearance  Endermen are tall, dark, and thin. They have long, skinny legs and arms, and pinkish-purple\u00a0eyes. They are about three blocks tall. They emit purple particle effects, which are the same as those emitted from Ender Pearls, end portals and Nether Portals.Behavior  Endermen will wander and will start to teleport around randomly, until a player attacks or \"stares\" at them\u00a0at under 65 blocks. \"Staring\" at an enderman is defined as aiming the cross hair at the enderman's head. Once a player looks at an enderman in the right spot, it becomes hostile toward them (unless the player is wearing a pumpkin head).\u00a0It will open its mouth and run or teleport to the player. An enderman will not be alerted if a player is protected by a method listed below. As of 1.4, the enderman will make a sound upon being provoked. The sound sounds similar to a loud running engine and is a warning to brace for sudden attacks. Even if the sounds have stopped, it does not guarantee that the enderman is no longer aggressive. It may have teleported far away from a player, or gotten stuck somewhere such as a nearby Cave. If a player leaves the world and then come back while being attacked by an enderman, it may have calmed down or teleported away. An aggressive enderman can be distracted from attacking a player if it is attacked by another mob, or if it is touched by sunlight. Endermen don't like sunlight, and will usually teleport to a cave or other covered location during the daytime. Endermen will take damage from both Water (including rain) and Fire or Lava, and will teleport away when they take most types of damage, but interestingly, they do not teleport away when coming into contact with fire or lava. If is raining, an enderman will teleport wildly until they teleport to a location where the rain doesn't hit them, most likely to a cave. Endermen cannot get hit by any type of projectile including arrows, snowballs, eggs, and negative splash potions. They will always teleport away immediately before getting hit. However, it is possible in the console versions of the game to hit an enderman with an arrow by aiming slightly above them so they don't teleport from being looked at. Endermen will occasionally pick up blocks at random times (even when aggressive), and then later place them somewhere else. If the enderman is killed with a block in its hand it will drop it. An enderman can pick up a block from any space directly adjacent to it (Including above its head or below its feet), and it can pick up some unexpected blocks, such as Cacti. If a player is wearing a pumpkin head, an Enderman might even take off the pumpkin. Endermen will attack Endermites (if the endermite was spawned from ender pearl teleportation) as long as there isn't a survival mode player nearby, in which case it prioritizes a player, even if it is not provoked. If an Enderman attacks a player for an extended period of time, so long as neither of you have died, eventually it will stop attacking you and start teleporting randomly. As of The Frostburn Update (for PC) and Minecraft: Pocket Edition 0.15.0, endermen can spawn in the Nether, making it almost impossible to avoid encountering endermen.Protection from Endermen  There are several ways to protect against enderman attacks. First, build \"Enderman Proof Shelters\", such as a pool of water or lava, as enderman will return to a neutral state once damaged by water or lava. A player can also build a two block tall house, as enderman cannot fit into a house too short. The best method, however, to protect against from endermen is to prevent them from attacking altogether. The simplest method is to wear a pumpkin in the helmet slot; while it significantly hinders vision, endermen will not be provoked by staring. Pumpkins will not stop endermen from attacking if they have already been provoked. In bases, having windows made out of glass is also a good idea, as glass will block the staring. If an enderman is already hostile and attacking, then being in a corner could potentially be a good idea, as the enderman will not be able to teleport behind one. After one has cornered themselves, remember that the best weapon against an enderman is surprisingly not a Diamond Sword, but rather, a Bucket of water.History Trivia Mobs  A list of all mobs that appear in Minecraft.Items Creeper  [view] \u2022 [talk] Creepers are one of the most unique and iconic hostile mobs found in Minecraft. A creeper can easily be recognized by its tall vertical structure (roughly the size of a player), green, pixelated skin, and four legs. It is one of\u00a0the most dangerous enemy in the game, as it is not affected by sunlight (but it can despawn after a while), which makes it a constant threat as it silently roams the map, searching for a player to explode upon. It should be noted, however, that most creepers do Despawn during the day, along with Spiders. It is often used as the game's mascot by Mojang.Origin  The creeper was created by accident by Notch, the creator of Minecraft. While Notch was trying to create the first ever passive mob, the pig, the code went wrong, and he accidentally swapped the height and length. As a result, he got a tall, slim being with the face and torso in the shape of a player instead of a pig. With no arms and 4 stubby legs, this creature became known as the creeper, a mob that when provoked or within distance of player blows up. It has earned Minecraft billions in marketing, and it is one of the most recognizable Minecraft mob and character, another example being Steve.Behavior  A creeper who has found a player will chase down that player until the distance between them is only a few blocks. It should be noted that creepers tend to walk to the right of a player. The creeper makes use of a suicide-bomb attack involving getting within close proximity of a player (usually 2\u20133 blocks) before exploding. A player's only warning to when the creeper is about to explode is by a very distinctive hiss, as well as the swelling and flashing of the creeper itself, which starts about 1\u20132 seconds prior to the explosion. If a player tries moving away when a creeper is hissing, it will cancel the detonation; however, the harder the Difficulty, the further away a player has to get. It takes three full seconds for the creeper to detonate. After it explodes, it will leave a large crater in the ground. The size of this crater is solely dependent on what the terrain is made from. Typically, a hole in the topsoil is created. However, they can be powerful enough to destroy Stone. When a creeper is killed by an arrow shot by a Skeleton, it will drop a random Music Disc, which can be played in a Jukebox. It doesn't matter what dealt most of the damage, as long as the last blow was the arrow of a skeleton. Creepers cannot use doors, but they can climb ladders and vines, unlike other hostile mobs and despite being armless. If a Creeper has been inflicted with a status effect, it will leave that effect behind on the ground, similar to Lingering Potions.Charged Creepers  If struck with lightning, a creeper will become a \"Charged Creeper\". Charged creepers are stronger, and they have a larger blast radius than a normal creeper. They also have a visible, electric aura surrounding them. Attack Strength:Strategy  Creepers can be somewhat formidable foes when encountered as their stealth gives them the upper hand. Creepers are slow, and they will also reverse their detonation time if a player leaves their range. This can be used to a player's advantage in melee combat. A player can simply hit the creeper with their Sword and then quickly back away before the creeper detonates which lets a player get at least two hits in before having to retreat. If this process is repeated, a creeper can be easily defeated. This is easily done by all players, even those who have started a new world. The most effective and safest way to eliminate a creeper is to simply use a bow as ranged combat will surmount the creeper's slow speed. A player would need at least three arrows with a regular bow; however, this can be minimized with enchantments. Another effective way is to light the ground on fire with a Flint and Steel and lead the creeper up to it.Tips  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Trivia References Iron Golem  [view] \u2022 [talk] Iron Golems are tough utility Mobs, built with four Blocks of Iron and one Carved Pumpkin or Jack o' Lantern. They are immune to drowning, fall damage, and knockback. Iron golems will naturally spawn in Villages with at least 21 Doors and 10 villagers. Iron golems are better known for being created by players, and can be created by building a vertical T of 4 iron blocks, and then placing a carved pumpkin on top.Slaying  Iron golems drop 3-5 iron ingots and 0-2 poppies on death; however, when a player kills an iron golem, a player's popularity in a village will decrease by -5. If the popularity level is below -15, natural iron golems will try to attack and kill a player. This does not apply to player-made golems.Behavior  Iron golems will become aggressive against any nearby hostile or neutral mob other than creepers or wolves. They will attack anything that attacks themselves or a Villager, except a player if the iron golem is player-made. A golem will only stop acting aggressively if they defeat a player or mob who attacked them, or if all players leave the game. If the village is near a large pool of water or the ocean, the iron golem will go in the water and stay in it until it dies. They may give the small villagers a Poppy Flower.Trivia Sword  Swords are weapons that are primarily used to kill mobs or players quicker than punching them with the bare hands. They also remove some blocks faster than using a player's bare hands (such as leaves, vines, and melons, though especially cobwebs). Each broken block counts as two uses on the sword's Durability when used in this way.Different Names Overview  The sword is a short-range weapon. Despite its appearance, it grants no range advantage over any other tool since Beta 1.9, including bare hands. Swords were previously used to block attacks up until The Combat Update, where Shields replaced sword-blocking. The durability and damage dealt depends on what material the sword was crafted of: gold being the lowest durability, Diamond being the highest. A player cannot break/mine anything with this weapon. Swords used to inflict more damage than bows, often significantly more, depending on material. Even a wooden sword was on par with an arrow. However, since the Adventure Update update, there are no (non-enchanted) swords that match a full-charged Arrow (with a non-critical hit). A way to use swords without being hit, thus closing the gap between swords and bows, is to dig a trench such that a player's head is the same level as the mob's feet. A player must of course have blocks over his head so that mobs do not come into the trench. It is then possible to hit mobs without them seeing a player: this prevents mobs from retaliating. This method is efficient when defending a fortified building, but is nearly useless when exploring except for whenever a player encounters the 2-block wide spider. High-damage swords are primarily advantageous because they kill mobs in fewer hits, defeating them faster and thereby reducing the chance of the Player being damaged in return. For the same reason, a player will swing these swords fewer times in the long run, reducing the rate at which durability is expended. Unless a player engages in combat very frequently, swords in general will see a far longer useful life. A diamond sword's damage of 8 HP over the iron sword's 7 HP is also a much bigger difference than the difference between the numbers may imply as it guarantees a kill of any mortal thing in fewer hits, and any passive mob in one. The ability to kill rapidly is of greatest benefit against Creepers and Ghasts when the time to act may be very short. These factors combined make a diamond sword a compelling investment. The weaker swords are not recommended for Creeper combat (especially on normal or hard), and there are strong arguments for using a bow, owing to its range (provided the bow is at full charge). If a player approaches a creeper with a sword, a recommended strategy is to use hit-and-run tactics. Hit the creeper and run away until the hissing stops, then run forward and hit it again, as many times as necessary. With a diamond sword, however, one may simply charge at the creeper whilst swinging it, as the 2-hit-kill allows a player to kill the creeper prior to their \"fuse\" running out. Be wary, as this is a risky tactic that could go horribly wrong if failed, often ultimately leading to the demise of a player or items and terrain around them. With the ability to sprint added in Beta 1.8, swords became a more effective tool in combat. When a mob is hit by a player when sprinting, they are sent flying several blocks back because the momentum is added to the mob's momentum. This is quite useful when fighting creepers, especially when a player has little to no armor. Charge at them in a sprint and hit them. They get knocked back to a safe distance before they could even initiate their self-destruct countdown. Simply repeat until the creeper dies. Just make sure there is room behind the creeper and that it does not get knocked back into an obstacle for maximum effectiveness. This tactic basically eliminates the need to run backwards before going for another hit. This tactic is not recommended for tight areas such as caverns and other tight spaces. Only do this when encountering a creeper in the open. A sword with the Knockback enchantment is also viable for the hit-and-run tactic, as it sends any mob flying back a few blocks when hit. This can replace sprinting, or even complement it, resulting in a greater effect. If a diamond sword is being used, this can make creeper disposal very easy. Along with the sprint tactic, this is not recommended for use against Skeletons, Blazes, or any ranged mob, as it grants them a free shot while being approached. Players are advised to make use of the critical hit ability of the sword to dispatch mobs, especially creepers, quickly. These hits add 50% of the sword's base damage but strength, but does not affect enchantments. Note that while sprinting, critical hits cannot be performed. As of Beta 1.8, swords are able to block attacks by holding the right click button. This will block arrows as well as other projectiles, but will reduce a player to a speed slower than sneaking. Swords and all other player-dealt damage were also reduced by half a heart in the beta 1.8 update (like before Beta 1.5), but was increased by 1 HP in release 1.6. Wooden swords can be put in furnaces as fuel, smelting 1 item per sword. Iron and gold swords can be smelted down for iron and gold nuggets, respectively.Sources  Iron swords appear in some Strongholds and Village blacksmith Chests; gold chests appear in some Nether Fortress chests; and enchanted iron and diamond swords can be found in End City chests. Weapon Smith Villagers sell enchanted iron and diamond swords for about 10 and 14 emeralds, respectively. Alternatively, wooden, stone, iron, gold, and diamond swords can be craftedCombat  A sword is a melee weapon - a weapon that can only be used in close combat. Because of this, they aren't recommended for fighting creepers, skeletons, or ghasts. A player can swing a sword by left-clicking while holding it. One good way to deal with these or any other hostile mobs is to run to them, strike them with the sword, then run back and repeat until they are defeated. A player could also hit critical strikes on the mobs by jumping and striking it with the sword on the way down. As of Beta 1.8, a player could block an attack with a sword by right-clicking while holding it. While doing this, a player will take half the damage of the attack. They could also be enchanted using an enchantment table to increase their advantage, and can have abilities added to them by using an Anvil and an Enchanted Book.Enchantments  Here is a list of possible sword enchantments:Trivia The End  The End is an alternate dimension that was introduced in the Beta 1.9 pre-releases. The End is inhabited by\u00a0Endermen, Shulkers, and an Ender Dragon.Getting to The End  To gain access to the End, a player must first locate a rare End Portal, which leads to this realm. Due to the large scale of a Minecraft world, End portals are nearly impossible to stumble upon by chance, as they are located in randomly-generated Strongholds deep underground. To find an End portal, a player needs to acquire and use one or more  Eyes of Ender. This is a craftable item, created by combining  Blaze Powder and an  Ender Pearl. The End portal can be located by throwing an eye of ender into the air (by right-clicking while holding the item),\u00a0which will send it flying through the air and other Blocks until it eventually falls down.\u00a0A player will need to throw multiple eyes of ender and pick them up. Multiple are needed, because there is a 1/5 chance the eye of ender will break and vanish. It will likely take multiple throws to become close to a stronghold, indicated when an eye of ender hovers in one place after being thrown. Use each throw to get the general direction in which to go, and travel a fair distance before throwing it again. Once a player finds the End portal within the stronghold, a player must repair it with several more eyes of ender. Activating the End portal requires 12 eyes of ender, however, there is a possibility of finding some eyes of ender inside of chests in the stronghold. It is best to be prepared with a surplus of eyes of ender before journeying forth. The 12 eyes of ender must be placed in the End Portal Frames surrounding the End portal. Once all 12 are in place, the portal will become active. By jumping into the portal, a player will be teleported to The End.Geography  The End consists of several large islands within a black void. There is plenty of Obsidian, End Stone and special blocks known as Ender Crystals which heal the Ender Dragon.Inner End  As soon as a player enters the End, a long purple bar (health) can be seen on top of the screen. This indicates the health of the Ender Dragon flying above (unless a player has already killed it previously). A player will spawn in a random location, sometimes in a small room underground, surrounded by end stone. There are\u00a0tall pillars of obsidian scattered throughout the End. These pillars have ender crystals on top of them that will regenerate the Ender Dragon's health when it is nearby. These crystals can be destroyed by hitting them once. However, because they explode upon being destroyed, it is advised to use a Bow and Arrows. They can also be safely destroyed by a thrown Egg or Snowball. After defeating the Ender Dragon, a portal will spawn directly under the spot where it was killed. Stepping through the portal will trigger the End Credits, giving a player the \"The End\" achievement before returning a player to the Overworld at the place of a player's spawn point. Before defeating the Ender Dragon, it is impossible to return to the overworld without dying. That being said, it is most advisable to create a few Ender Chests in which items can be stored, and then accessed from any dimension to avoid losing any important items while destroying the healing crystals.Outer End  In The Combat Update, a new area of The End was made accessible to players. To teleport to this new region of the End, a player must: It is possible to physically build a bridge to the islands of the outer end, but this isn't a viable option, as the gap is around 1000 blocks long. Another way of accessing the islands is by using elytra and firework rockets. The Outer End consists of a number of large islands, with Chorus Plants and End City structures.Trivia The Nether  The Nether is a separate dimension outside of the Overworld, which players can visit. It is also referred to as \"The Nexus\" in Notch's and Jeb's Blog on Tumblr, sometimes called \"Gate to Inferno Fields\" and was previously known as The Slip and Hell (the latter being its current technical name) during the Indev stage.Overview  The Nether was originally added as part of the Halloween Update. It exists in a completely different world from the overworld. The terrain is dimly lit, full of Lava streams flowing from the ceiling, sudden cliffs, and lava lakes, making it extremely dangerous to explore. The ceiling and the base of the Nether are made of Bedrock. Mushrooms are also commonly found. If a player dies in The Nether, they will be transported back to the spawn point in the overworld, while their items stay in the nether for the normal amount of time. Maps can be made of the Nether, but they must be crafted in the Nether. If a player brings a map of the overworld into the Nether, it will stay the same, but the marker that represents a player will be absent. Also, sudden bridges and shafts can be found throughout the randomly generated world. One will most likely find the bridge partially destroyed, and the shaft is located near lots of enemies, so watch out. Always carry weapons, bridge repair kits, and useful renewable items with one. Sometimes, the Nether can be classified as useful or exciting, since one can find large quantities of Soul Sand and Glowstone, and Cacti can grow here. The Nether is also the only place where Nether Quartz can be found.Travel  A Nether Portal is made by creating a 4x5 (2x3 on inside) or larger door frame out of Obsidian and then lighting the inside of the frame on fire with Flint and Steel or a Fire Charge. The corners of the frame may be left out, using only 10 obsidian as opposed to the usual 14. When one stands inside the portal for the first time, it will create a portal in its equivalent area of the Nether. A loading screen will appear during the change of worlds.  A portal can be shut down if part of the obsidian frame is removed (not including corners), or hit by a Ghast's fireball. When re-entering the overworld, any distance covered in the Nether is multiplied by 8, effectively making The Nether a fast-travel zone that allows for greater distances to be covered in a short amount of time in the overworld. One has to stay in a portal. If not, it will not teleport a player. In order to use them, a player has to stand still inside the purple haze. A recent update allowed overworld mobs to go through portals and vice versa. Attempting to go through a portal while in a minecart or on a pig will result in a player needing to restart the game to continue because a player can see permanent purple swirls. The same effects happen in the very buggy Far Lands. A useful way to save obsidian is to create a Nether portal with the ordinary 14 blocks, travel to the Nether, remove the corner bits, then travel back to the overworld and remove the corners there too.Mobs  Most mobs that spawn in the overworld do not spawn in the nether. The only exceptions are the Enderman, Skeleton, and Zombie Pigman (which only appears in the overworld when pigs are struck by lightning). Instead, the nether contains an entirely different list of mobs.Blocks  Blocks can be brought to and from the overworld. So far, there are eight block types only found in the Nether: There are currently 5 blocks that spawn both in the Nether and in the overworld Water cannot be brought to the Nether, and all water placed will evaporate immediately due to the extreme heat, and will instead turn into steam. However, players can place lava and ice blocks in the Nether, but placing an ice block will have no effect. As of current updates, one are no longer able to have ice melt into water. Instead, the block of ice leaves nothing behind upon breaking.Etymology  The Nether's name is derived from the English word \"Ether\", meaning \"In the outer reaches of space or in the heavens\", or \"nowhere known\" + an N. Nether could similarly be derived from a mythical location known as the \"netherworld\", usually depicted as a place where the wicked go when they decease.Survival and Tips Trivia Enchantment Table  The Enchantment Table is used to enchant certain items using Experience Points. Items that can be enchanted include: Swords, Pickaxes, Shovels, Axes, Bows, Books, and Armor. Enchantment tables alone typically have upgrades ranging from two to seven experience levels. If a player is within a certain range, the book on the table will open, face a player, and flip pages every several seconds. As of update 1.8, Lapis Lazuli is required to enchant items. The chance of getting a better enchantment can be increased by placing bookshelves around the table. Only bookshelves that are two blocks away will add enchantments. When placed correctly, an animation of floating symbols moving into the book entity will occur. The text is written in the Standard Galactic Alphabet. The ideal position of bookshelves is a square of 15 placed in a 5x5-block outline, with the enchantment table in the middle.Enchantments  (See the Enchantments article for a complete list).Trivia Pickaxe  A Pickaxe is a Tool used to mine stone-type blocks and ores in any Minecraft world. They are required to gather Stone resources for Crafting and building, as well as gathering mineral resources such as Iron Ore and Coal. Pickaxes can also be used to gather other blocks, but they aren't as effective as the preferred tool type. As with all types of tools, there are various types of Enchantments available for the pickaxe. Of all the tools, the pickaxe is the tool that deals the third-highest amount of damage when compared to other tools of the same composition.Types  Listed from lowest mining strength to highest, the materials are:Speed and Durability  A pickaxe will lose Durability at a faster rate if it is used to attack Mobs, opposed to mining. The reasoning for this is because pickaxes are not meant for combat. The following table shows the time it takes to break each type of block. A block marked with a red background indicates that it cannot be harvested by that certain pickaxe, and the block will be destroyed. A green background indicates the quickest tool type(s) for the corresponding block. Note that some blocks will not drop anything, regardless of the tool used.Trivia Blaze  [view] \u2022 [talk] The Blaze is an uncommon mob with yellow colored skin and black eyes. They first appeared in the Beta 1.9 Pre-release 1 version. These are hostile mobs who are located within The Nether. When a player is spotted, they will set themselves on fire, which does not damage them, and they will then shoot a 3 round-burst type of fireball attacks at a player. They guard Nether fortresses and are usually spawned from a Monster Spawner, but can be found roaming Nether Foretresses. They are easily recognized as a ball of flames, which can help a player notice a blaze before they are noticed. Since a Blaze is on fire, and fire is extinguished by water, Blazes are the only mobs that can be killed with snowballs. Zero to one blaze rods are dropped when killed. Blazes have two attacks. When a player is close, the Blaze hits a player for about 2 hearts of damage. If the Blaze has spotted a player, but a player is too far, the Blaze will shoot a fireball at a player, which ignites on impact.Spawning  Blaze spawners can be found only in Nether fortresses and will start spawning Blazes once a player gets within 16 blocks. The mob spawners have a chance of spawning 1\u20134 Blazes at once. Blazes can only spawn in light level 11 or lower (at the lower half of their body). Blazes can also spawn naturally elsewhere in Nether Fortresses.Behavior  Although Blazes are able to fly, they will stay on the ground or sink down slowly in the air when not attacking. Blazes will attempt to swim upwards in lava, much like regular mobs behave in water. When they see a player, they will start flying and shooting. They will catch fire briefly. A short cool-down period occurs between attacks. In addition to normal weapons, Blazes can be hurt by snowballs, taking 3 (1 1/2 hearts) per hit. If they have found a way into the Overworld, they are also damaged by water and even rain. Water does roughly 1 damage every second. Like all Nether mobs, they are not damaged by fire or lava. If killed by a player, they drop Blaze Rods. They will attack each other if one blaze hits another, just like Skeletons. On the Xbox 360/PS3 version, Blazes do not catch fire when either attacked in Creative mode or when they have spotted a player. They also do not make fireball sounds, making it hard to find where they're coming from. They also drop glowstone dust on occasion, as well as their blaze rods. This makes glowstone a renewable resource on the Xbox/PS3.Strategy  Blazes are considerably difficult mobs to fight, due to their ranged attacks and rapid rate of fire. Their ability to fly usually leaves a player's sword useless, while charging a bow leaves a player vulnerable. Their flight also can make it tricky to collect their loot. One response is to use a fishing rod to reel them in. Another is to run behind a corner and ambush them once they get close, or place blocks to take cover between attacks as they advance. However, as of 1.9 and the addition of shields, the fireballs can be completely negated. If surrounded, however, it is difficult even with a shield as the blazes can shoot from different angles, nullifying the shield. The use of fire resistance is extremely helpful when fighting Blazes, as their attacks usually wind up dealing more fire damage than initial impact. While fire protection can absorb a lot of damage, total fire resistance is necessary to shrug off the hail of fire. For a player's first Blaze fight, they can make a shield and bow, which are very cheap, needing only three string, three sticks (bow), and six wood and one iron ingot (shield). Enchanted Golden Apples can be an effective way of encountering blazes for the first time, but they are no longer craftable in vanilla Minecraft, so a player will have to rely on their seldom occurrences in chests. Snowballs are deadly to Blazes, doing 3 points of damage apiece, and snowballs can be thrown a lot more quickly than a bow can be charged up. Plus, snow is easy to find in any snowy biome and is even renewable, therefore allowing easy obtaining. In case inventory is tight, snow blocks can be used to store snowballs 16 times more efficiently. However, a shovel is necessary to re-obtain the snowballs. Wolves do not do well against Blazes. Besides the monster's high health, they tend to get set afire (splash potions of fire resistance can help). If they are used, bring extra wolves, and plenty of rotten flesh or other meat to heal them. (Zombie Pigmen drop rotten flesh, although attacking Zombie Pigmen is a very dangerous thing to do.) On a positive note, wolf kills do get blaze drops and experience. Iron Golems can be used to kill blazes, but there are several drawbacks: 'Camping' at a Blaze spawner is an effective way to gather Blaze Rods, as they will always appear close enough to attack with a sword, and there is a delay in their attack after they spawn because they have to charge first. This is best done in combination with the fire resistance potions in effect. A blaze farm can be built in several ways in several ways. A good method is to construct a box around the entire spawn zone (tip: the fences around the spawner are not far enough away). Another would be to make a doorway to kill them as they come down, or a single hole in the bottom where they can be shot from. Again, stay within 16 blocks of the spawner to keep it going. A trap for them can be made by digging a shelter under their balcony, then mine a 1\u00d73 hole up to their balcony. Sometimes, a natural version of this will appear, when a narrow staircase leads up to the spawner room. Another good way to hunt Blazes is to use a melee approach that exploits a Blaze's attack cycle: The blaze will \"burn\" for a few seconds, then fire three, and only three, fire charges. If a player is not in line of sight, the Blaze will delay its attack until they are, and eventually, the Blaze will itself move into line of sight and fire. After firing, they need to wait a few seconds before they can fire again. Blazes are an efficient way to farm experience. They drop 10 experience points when killed by a player, as opposed to only 5 dropped by most other hostile mobs. The above camping method, combined with potions of fire resistance, can generate an average of about 65 experience per minute.Trivia Gallery Giant  [view] \u2022 [talk] A Giant, or Giant Zombie, is an extremely large, hostile mob. Their model first appeared in Survival Test, but was abandoned. Giants were originally neutral mobs, and did not attack a Player without incite. This was likely due to their near-boss physique and health. They have the same appearance as a zombie, but are six times larger. Before their AI was removed in 1.8, their only method of attack was to charge endlessly at a player. Giants have 50 hearts total, half of the Ender Dragon's, but still equally deadly. They are capable of being spawned with the  command (since 1.7), and third-party programs such as SinglePlayerCommands (SPC), but they cannot spawn naturally, due to requiring a light level of both greater than 11 and less than 8. They can ride in minecarts, which will cause a bug where the giant appears to levitate above the minecart while sitting on nothing. The hitbox on the model itself only includes the giant's legs, waist and stomach; any attacks that make contact above this point will not cause damage, or even hit it. Giants have made a re-introduction into Minecraft, however, they still cannot be created naturally. In snapshot 13w36a, giants can be summoned via the  command and mods. In addition to Minecraft: Java Edition, they were in the Xbox 360 release. However, their AI is removed, and right now they can only be spawned with their spawn egg (which can only be obtained via external modifications). Trying to spawn a giant with a spawn egg will crash the game (except in the Xbox 360 release).Video  The following video was made by Notch, testing out giants on February 4, 2010.Survival Mode Guide  This page is for the casual player who wants a nice simple outline of what steps must be taken to thrive. There will not be in depth information on \"completing\" the game of Minecraft on here, as there is already a much more in depth explanation and plan on the original page. Again, this is for a player who just wants to know how to get started and use Minecraft to pass the time. Survival Mode\u00a0is a\u00a0game mode where\u00a0a player must survive by building and altering the terrain to fulfill one's needs all the while keeping an eye on the ever present Health Bar and Hunger Bar. Depending on what difficulty\u00a0one chooses to play in, the danger of either one depleting to life-threatening levels arises.\u00a0The objective of the game is to survive and armed with only one's right hand. It will be difficult to do so for much time without acquiring necessary resources. The ideal progression of actions is as follows: From here on, it is up to one what one do. One can explore the world and build amazing structures. One can keep to one central point and create a self-sufficient little haven. One can even try one's luck at going through the whole game to its \"end\". One decide what one make of this near infinite world.Trivia See also Snow Golem  [view] \u2022 [talk] Snow Golems, also known as Snowmen, are a unique type of passive Mobs that are created by a player. As they walk, they leave snow trails in their wake. In cold and cool biomes, it'll happen at any elevation; in warm biomes, it will typically only occur above sea level. It is also fair to note that snow golems will take damage when it rains (but not when it snows), and in any hot biome (i.e. the nether, deserts, mesas, savannas, and jungles). Upon death, they drop only Snowballs, meaning that no pumpkin will be dropped as used in the creation. Making a snow golem consists of 2 Snow Blocks and a carved pumpkin. Place the two blocks of snow on top of each other, and the carved pumpkin at last on top, and the snow golem will be created.Behavior  Snow golems wander aimlessly until a hostile mob is seen, after which they will throw snowballs at it. Snowballs do not do damage, but anger the mob, thus diverting the enemy's attention. The mobs will then attack the snow golem until it is dead. Snow golems can only hurt blazes since blazes can be killed by throwing snowballs at them.Weaknesses  As previously stated, snow golems will take damage from any form of water, similar to endermen. However, they cannot survive in the nether, jungle biomes, or desert biomes because of the heat. A fire resistance potion will render them immune to these biomes, however.How to Build  To create a snow golem, a player must stack two snow blocks on the ground, then place a pumpkin on top of it. This does not require a crafting table. An alternative for carved pumpkins can be a Jack-O-Lantern. Note that when building it, the pumpkin must be put on last. This makes snow golems impossible to generate via redstone-affected items. Also, note that they can be created in the Xbox 360 Edition\u00a0as of a recent update.\u00a0However, only 8 of them can be created at a time.Trivia Villager  [view] \u2022 [talk] Villagers, formerly known as Testificates, are human passive Non-Player Characters (NPCs) that spawn and move around in Villages and sometimes igloos. They have different roles, such as Priests, Butchers, Tool Smiths, Weapon Smiths, Leatherworkers, Clerics, Farmers, Shepherds, Nitwit, and librarians and spawn in their respective buildings. They possess large heads, green eyes, uni-brows, and long, Squidward-like noses. You can also trade with villagers but each villager with each role trades different stuff.Behavior  Villagers are considered as one of the most intelligent of all peaceful mobs. However, there are some factors that they are unaware of or pay no attention to. Villagers realize the day-night cycle as well. Villagers are not fond of Water, and unlike the other peaceful mobs, will immediately attempt to find an escape route. Villagers will attempt to avoid zombies. However, they do not attempt to escape any attackers except zombies. Unlike other mobs, villagers do not notice when they are set on Fire, making any source of fire extremely dangerous to a village's population. Villagers will not run when they are on fire as well, showing no attempt to put the fire out. Villagers spawn in either villages which can be located only in the flattest (or close to flat) Biomes, such as desert biomes, savannas, and plains, or in igloo basements. When a villager notices a zombie, they immediately begin to run away from them. Villagers are fast enough to escape a zombie, Zombie Villager, Zombie Pigman, or husk. However, this will not always protect them, and a baby zombie will outrun them. When it becomes night time, all villagers move in-doors to safety. However, there is a flaw in this behavior. Whenever it is raining outside, villagers still realize it as day. Zombies, however, will not die because it is raining, and the sun is not out. This can cause some villagers to die. Villagers will also run away when they see a Vindicator, Evoker or an Illusioner. A common sight in a village would be villagers facing each other, assuming the human-like characteristic of \"talking\". When a player attacks a villager, they have steam coming from their heads, most-likely indicating anger or frustration. As of 1.6, villagers will produce noises (sounding similar to a \"hmmm\", a grunt, or a humming sound). They make noises on several occasions: when Breeding is activated, when struck by a player, or when a player trades with one. Villagers also can pick up food, and share it to other villagers. They will pick up wheat, bread, carrots, potatoes, and beetroots. All villagers will additionally pick up seeds and beetroot seeds but only Farmer Villagers will actually plant them (giving seeds to a non-farmer villager is only useful for disposing of excess seeds). Once a villager has enough food, and there are\u00a0enough doors in the village, villagers will begin to breed. In the Bedrock Edition, villagers will run away from the player, and anger particles will not appear, even close to a village, unless the player looks at its trading interface. Also, farmer villagers can be seen holding certain farm items like carrots and drop them to give them to other villagers.Trading  Villagers are able to be traded with in the game for various Items depending on their \"profession\" or type of villager. The currency that they handle are Emeralds. Some villagers will trade for emeralds, while others will take emeralds and give items. Farmer type villagers, known for their brown clothing, are known to trade items related to farming, such as wheat, carrots, Potatoes, and melon seeds for emeralds, or vice versa. Farmers tend to occupy farms and plant a new crop and take out the full-grown food. The Butcher type, known for the brown clothing and white apron, will trade for meat such as porkchops, beef, mutton, and chicken. It is far more common for the trade to require the raw version of the meat. Priests, which can be recognized by their full magenta clothing, trade for Ender Pearls and Eyes of Ender. They also allow a player to buy enchanted items by trading an unenchanted version of the item, in addition to a few emeralds as the cost of enchanting the item. One of the most common trades this particular villager offers is the Rotten Flesh for an emerald. The Blacksmith type of villager trades for armor and tools and weapons. The Librarian villager is known for his all white clothing and \"smart\" look, buys paper and sells books and navigational related items, such as bookshelves and compasses. Lastly there is one other villager called the Nitwit, it wears a green robe and does not trade when one right clicks him. Villagers all start with one trade agreement. Once a player does this trade and then closes the trading interface, the villager will have a \"thinking\" type animation and come up with another trade. This does two things. First, it allows more trading options, up to a maximum of 5 per villager, and second, it resets the trade. Each trade will be able to be used 7 times until it must be reset again. The villager will only reset if the final or \"newest\" trade is completed at least one time. Once all five are unlocked, continuing the last trade will continue to reset the trades, and also has a small chance of replacing an existing trade with a new one. Trading is one of the fastest ways to get emeralds legitimately in Survival (Game mode) without the use of cheats, as farming animals and crops are far faster than digging for emeralds. This allows players to constantly trade and renew trades that yield emeralds to a player. This is also known sometimes as \"farming emeralds\", or \"emerald bartering.\" As of Minecraft 1.8, the villagers' trading got a complete overhaul. Villagers could now have several trades when they are spawned giving a player more flexibility when trading. Another factor that helps is that when trading, new trade possibilities can occur depending on how many new trades players have made already. The Exploration Update added new \"Cartographer\" villagers, who will trade their Exploration Map for a compass and varied amounts of Emeralds gathered by a player.Popularity  A player's popularity within a particular village can be increased or decreased in many ways, with one notable consequence: if a player has a popularity below -15, naturally spawned Iron Golems will become permanently hostile towards a player. Popularity can be gained by trading, breeding, etc., but will decrease by attacking\u00a0villagers\u00a0and/or\u00a0iron golems. A player's popularity can be high in one village, yet low in another. Actions which decrease a player's popularity are as follows:Variants Illagers  Illagers are hostile, villager-like mobs. There are 3 types: the evoker, vindicator, and illusioner. All illagers will attack villagers and iron golems. The evoker and vindicator spawn in Woodland Mansions while the illsuioner is unused.Witches  Witches are hostile villager like mobs that are much like illagers. They spawn rarely in the overworld in low light levels, or by a Witch hut. Witches will also spawn if a villager is struck by lightning. They will not attack villagers, but will attack iron golems.NPC  NPC's are villager like mobs who are exclusive to the Education Edition. They provide tips and come in several different looks. Despite strongly resembling villagers like the other variants, NPCs do not trade, but right clicking opens their \"speech\" interface.Zombie Villager  [view] \u2022 [talk] Zombie Villagers are aggressive mobs that appeared in Minecraft's Pretty Scary Update (Version 1.4). They make up 5% of zombies that spawn in the Overworld. They will also appear after a villager is killed by a zombie during a village siege, 50% on Normal and 100% on Hard. If a baby villager is killed during a siege, it will also become a baby zombie villager. Baby zombie villagers are faster than their grown-up counterparts and will not age. Zombie villagers can be cured and\u00a0returned to normal villagers if weakened using a splash potion of weakness, and then fed a Golden Apple. They will appear to shudder while being cured. It is best to place zombie villagers in a sort of \"prison cell\" structure with a bed and iron bars while curing it. This is because the iron bars and bed make the villager cure about 4% faster. Zombie villagers take 2\u20135 minutes to cure under normal circumstances. A zombie villager has all the behaviors and characteristics of regular zombies, such as being able to wear armor, but when equipping mob heads, the nose tends to get in the way. In the Pocket Edition, zombie villagers do not spawn with armor, nor does it show, unless it is a chestplate, which is basically a rectangle that appears in the inner part of the zombie villager's torso. It can be seen by simply looking through a hole in the zombie villager's tattered clothing. Iron golems will still attack them, unless they are cured. In Pocket Edition and 1.9, they retain their clothes and appearance prior to being infected.\u00a0Trivia See Also  Illager Witch NPCList of Items Blocks  Blocks are different types of items in Minecraft.\u00a0 Blocks are placeable, unlike most other items (without the use of an item frame). They make up the in-game environments, and they can be collected and utilized in many different ways. Some blocks spawns naturally, such as Dirt or Stone while other blocks, such as Bricks and Redstone Lamps, must be crafted by a player. Most people would say that Wood is one of the most helpful blocks due to its widespread use. All player-made structures are created using a variety of blocks or just one. Certain blocks have special uses, for example, Jack-O-Lanterns, Glowstone, Sea Lanterns, and redstone lamps can be used to light underwater areas since they cannot be put out by water. Just make sure that the redstone signal isn't destroyed with redstone lamps. There are three different transparency levels of blocks. There are completely transparent blocks, such as Air. There are semi-transparent blocks, such as Glass and Leaves. There are also opaque blocks, such as Wood or Cobblestone. Most blocks that are at least somewhat transparent will not be able to have Torches placed on them. The face of a block is 16\u00d716 pixels, and each block is proportionately one cubic meter. Most blocks are static, although water, Lava, Portal, and Fire blocks have a shifting pattern. While the default texture pack's textures have 16 by 16 block faces, there are texture packs with 32x32 or even 64x64 textures. These texture packs often require a mod. But usually they just require the default Minecraft texture pack.World-generated Blocks  Entries marked with a  require additional data values to entirely define the block in a Minecraft world. Entries marked with an  have a different ID as an inventory item. Entries marked with a  require additional inventory data to fully define the inventory item. Entries marked with a  have tile entities associated with them to store additional data. Items with IDs in red cannot be legitimately obtained by a player in the game. They can only be obtained by \"hacking\" (Such as using an inventory editor) or while in multiplayer servers, or by using the /give command. Items available only in Creative mode are in blue. Items only obtainable through the Silk Touch enchantment in Survival Mode are in green.The Overworld  Below is a list of blocks that can be obtained in the overworld.Naturally Generated  Naturally generated blocks include blocks that are created through a 'seed' either player generated or generated by a random seed generator.Naturally Created  Naturally created means a combination of events that cause a new block to be placed by natural causes and NOT by the player.Structures  Same as naturally generated, but these blocks are only created with the \"Generate Structures\" option enabled. The most pack of blocks is 64.The Nether  To get to the Nether, one must obtain at least 10 obsidian Blocks from the overworld, a result from the collision of water with still lava, and arrange the obsidian in a 4x5 formation (with any block, including air, making up the corners). Once fire is added, one can travel to the Nether.Naturally Generated Naturally Created Additional Reading  There are currently 153 different types of blocks, including air, which cannot be built, still water, still lava, various types of wood, various colors of wool, various types of pressure plates, slabs, stairs and Double Slabs. See Data Values for the full list. In a standard randomly generated world, one can find air, stone, grass, snow, dirt, water, water source, lava, lava source, sand, sandstone, gravel, gold ore, iron ore, diamond ore, redstone ore, lapis lazuli ore, clay block, coal ore, bedrock, ice, wood, birch wood, wooden planks, etc. In Abandoned Mines pine/spruce wood, leaves, cacti, sugar cane, vines, pumpkins, dandelions, poppies, brown and red Mushrooms, dead bushes, shrubs and tall grass. In Dungeons (added in Seecret Friday Update 2), one can also find cobblestone, mossy cobblestone, a monster spawner and chests, even though cobblestone and chests are usually made by a player. Cobblestone, wooden planks, fences, pressure plates, bookshelves, crafting tables, stairs, torches, black wool, glass panes, iron bars, lava, chests and furnaces may also be found in the randomly generated NPC Villages that were added in Beta 1.8, and stone bricks, Mossy Stone Bricks, Cracked Stone Bricks, iron bars, end portal frames, monster spawners, bookshelves, wooden planks, fences, chests and cobwebs can be found in the Strongholds and Abandoned Mineshafts also added in Beta 1.8. Obsidian can be found naturally, but it is not part of the random generation. Instead, it is created when naturally occurring lava source blocks and water come in contact. Cobblestone can also be found naturally, and is formed with the same circumstances as obsidian, except that it is formed when water and moving lava contact. Dungeons are also built of cobblestone in parts. In the initial, free version of survival, a player began with 10 TNT blocks, and they could obtain dirt, cobblestone from stone, wooden planks from wood, Gold Blocks from gold ore, Iron Blocks from iron ore, stone slabs from coal ore and white wool from Sheep. In Classic mode a player can build with naturally occurring blocks (except for Redstone and Diamond), and can use bookcase, Sponge, colored wool, brick, obsidian and moss stone. Operators of servers can also place bedrock. Some custom servers give the ability to place grass and (still) Fluids, too. When playing the current version, a player can craft a variety of blocks not naturally found in maps, including crafting tables, bookshelves, furnaces, etc. Redstone, diamond, Gold and Lapis Lazuli can be found in the lower areas of maps. Netherrack, glowstone, gravel, soul sand, nether brick, nether brick fence, nether brick stairs and nether wart can be found in The Nether, which a player can only enter by creating a Nether Portal, and end stone and obsidian can be found in the End, which a player can only enter by inserting eyes of ender in all the end portal frames. Bedrock, torches, an End portal, an End gateway and a dragon egg are created after beating the Ender Dragon. The Pocket Edition has 3 additional blocks: the Cyan Flower, Nether Reactor Core and Glowing Obsidian.See also Trivia References Human  [view] \u2022 [talk] Humans were non-playable characters (NPCs) taking the form of clones of a player (the default skin). They spawned when 'G' was pressed while playing in Classic mode, but this function was later removed in Survival Test. If a player has a custom skin, any humans created will still use default skin and will not assume the look of a player. Humans could not create nor break blocks, and would only move around the map aimlessly, walking in slightly imperfect circles and jumping occasionally. Humans were only affected by solid blocks, but strangely not fluids, walking through them as if they were air. Humans were only spawned by pressing G in the Pre-Classic, and later by map editiors. Today humans can only be spawned by mods.Appearance  Humans had brown hair and rather peculiarly purple eyes. They had exactly the same clothing as a Player and Zombies.Behaviour  Humans could not create or delete blocks, but will wander around the map in circles, or occasianally jump around. A human may choose to attack players like zombies.History Trivia References Diamond Ore  Diamond Ore is an ore for a rare gem, diamond, which is one of the most valuable resources for tools and armor found in Minecraft.Overview  Immediately after mining the block, a player acquires a diamond, rather than the ore itself. Diamond can be used to make very strong tools and durable armor. However, diamonds are quite hard to find, and are usually located from 0 to 16 layers above the bedrock level. To mine diamond ore, a player will need an iron or diamond pickaxe. To obtain the diamond ore block, it must be mined with an iron pickaxe or higher with the Silk Touch enchantment on it. Often, a player will encounter underground dungeons while digging, and can loot chests within to find diamonds and other ores.Mining  Diamond ores appear at layers 7\u201313, and sometimes can be found at bedrock layer. There are many popular and efficient ways to find diamond. One such way is to randomly dig around Layer 10, and depending on a player's luck, they will get 16\u201334 diamonds with 8\u201310 iron pickaxes being used and destroyed. It is also a good idea to enchant the pickaxe with Unbreaking or Efficiency before a player starts to dig. Mining a diamond ore itself requires the silk touch enchantment. The ore can later be excavated with a pickaxe with a fortune I, II, or III enchantment for a chance to get more diamonds.Trivia Ender Pearl  Ender Pearls\u00a0are items that were added in the 1.8 Beta Adventure Update. They are occasionally dropped by Endermen upon death, and they are a crucial component in locating and accessing The End.Uses  As of the Beta 1.9 pre-release 2, it is possible to throw an Ender Pearl by right-clicking while it is in a player's hand in order to teleport to its impact location, causing  (2.5) damage to the user in the process. This is classified as fall damage, so the Feather Falling enchantment will lessen the damage taken. When an Ender Pearl is thrown, a player will be unable to throw another one for one second (shown by a white overlay). Upon teleporting, a player is briefly surrounded by the same particles generated by Endermen when they teleport for a few seconds.  Ender Pearls are a necessary item needed to reach The End. An Ender Pearl can be used to craft an  Eye of Ender by combining it with a  Blaze Powder. Eyes of Ender can be thrown into the air and if they are followed, they will eventually lead the user to the location of the End Portal. Once at the portal, up to twelve Eyes of Ender are also required to activate it.Trivia Pigmen  [view] \u2022 [talk] A Pigman is a pig in a humanoid form that originally were going to inhabit villages. Although not implemented, their skin can be found within the game files, and their counterpart, zombie pigmen, have been part of The Nether since the Minecraft Alpha 1.2.0 Halloween Update. It has the same dimensions as a Player, and has no coding present within the game that spawns it. Although a pigman could be made from a pig getting hit by lightning in earlier versions, the feature has been since removed.History  Minecraft user Miclee made up the idea for Pigmen. He was given the Bacon Cape as a reward. However, when Notch was asked for personal capes by other users, the Bacon Cape was taken away from Miclee to prevent further commotion. Notch mentioned April 25, 2011 that he might add Pigmen as NPC villages' townspeople. In Beta 1.9 Pre-releases, a different villager mob was introduced. Regular pig models were changed in Beta 1.8 to have a protruding snout. Whether this will be applied to Pigmen or Zombie Pigmen in the future is unknown, although possibly unlikely due to the fact stated above of sharing the same shape as other entities.Trivia See also References ", "Minecraft CreepyPasta Wiki": "Minecraft CreepyPasta Wiki Minecraft Creepypasta Wiki Herobrine.jpeg Templates  There are many templates in use in Minecraft CreepyPasta Wiki; these are only a subset, representing some of the most important and commonly used ones.

He is currently known by 4 people, out of which 0.9 play his games.Description  Mario\u00a0is the\u00a0fat, greasy,\u00a0wop\u00a0mascot for\u00a0Nintendo, and has starred in\u00a0roughly 90%of their games due to Shigeru Miyamoto's insatiable shroom fetish. Mario is known throughout the world for his habit of breaking\u00a0blocks, collecting\u00a0coins, throwing\u00a0fire balls, getting high off shrooms, getting pwned by\u00a0turtles\u00a0and\u00a0Goombas.Summary  Super Mario Brothers\u00a0are a pair of plumbers from a somewhat popular video game series known for its platforming, characters, and making 80's nostalgics, well, nostalgic. Since their\u00a0conception\u00a0in the 1980's, they are popular worldwide for\u00a0reasons that are still being looked into.A legend is born...\u00a0edit  The original heroes of\u00a0Italy\u00a0were born in a cave between\u00a01954\u00a0and\u00a01963. They were forced to eat nuts and berries until they were 13 years old. They planned to move into the city. However, growing up in the blistering heat of the wild caused them to stumble down a pipe into\u00a0Super Mario World. After falling 20 miles down the pipe they landed on top of Teenage Bowser. Bowser immediately got angry and ripped his pants. He has still not forgiven them.Biography Early Life  He originally appeared as a brand of cookies during the 1600s. Everyone enjoyed the cookies immensely, so the Super Mario Cookies were mass-marketed, and later Luigi cookies were made. After Mario and Luigi got very popular in the 1600s, Mario began appearing in forms of entertainment. Mario was frequently inserted into Renaissance works of literature and art, such as William Shakespeare's Mario & Juliet and the famous painting Mario Lisa.Hiring By Nintendo  In the late 1900s, classical works became much less popular. While Mario was walking one day down the street, he met Shigeru Miyamoto who gave him a job at Nintendo so he could create videogames. He was soon a classic hit. However, problems started. The rival videogame characters Sonic and Pacman showed up on the scene and became famous, but nowhere near as famous as Mario.The Videogame War And Its Aftermath  Then came the Videogame War where Mario Fans, Pacman Fans and Sonic Fans fought everywhere. Kids fought in school arguing who was better: Mario, Pacman or Sonic. Many got kicked out of schools for fighting. Not only did kids fight, but adults too. Therefore, many of them got fired. The Videogame War lasted for 30 years, until the creator of Sonic was thought to have died, and everyone forgot about Sonic, while Pacman's creator forgot about Pacman and instead got a girlfriend. Sonic games were then brought back when Sonic's creator was revealed to be alive. While the Videogame War was on, videogame makers were afraid of making Mario games so instead, they created Luigi games. To this day, Mario videogames are now becoming less popular and they're instead making Mario foods, cookies, lollipops, and sodas. The production of these products stopped while Mario and Luigi\u00a0were arrested.In The Foreign Legion  After Mario and Luigi escaped from prison, they were abducted by one of Napoleon's flying saucers. They were then forced to serve in the Foreign Legion. While fighting in the Yoshi's Island Scandal, Mario was killed. However, he was revived by Napoleon. Mario then when back to working at Nintendo.Meanwhile...  Meanwhile, New Mario\u00a0became Mario's replacement. He was not a cookie, which was a plus. He loved to breakdance though, and was fired. Later, he was hired again as an old man after Cario (his replacement, a red buggy) was totalled, until he quit. He was replaced by Rapper Mario, until Rapper Mario died while fighting in the Foreign Legion. Smallio would take his place, until he became angry that people were stomping on him. As a result, he was fired. Killogramio would be his next replacement before his life ended when he stood on a thin ledge above lava and broke through it due to weighing 1000 Kilograms. Lario would proceed to take his place afterward, but retired after being received so well. Hitario was Lario's replacement, but was fired when Nintendo discovered that he looked nothing like Mario, but more like some other guy. After Hitario was fired, he was replaced by Dry Mario, a dry bones-like version of Mario. Dry Mario starred in a few shames, but then caused the death of several Nintendon't staff. As revenge, Dry Mario was executed. He was replaced by Mummio, a mummy version of Mario. Eventually, Mummio got his bandages caught. Since he had nothing underneath the bandages, Mummio fell apart and was technically dead. Mummio was then replaced by Wario however once Nintendo found out he was a member of the X-Men he was fired.Mario's Youtube Account  Trying to forget about Nintendo, Mario created his own YouTube account. Mario made bloopers of his own games, the messed up stunts that happened in his life, YouTube Poops (as annoying as Waluigi, but somewhat funny), and best of all, fads. Mario loves fads more than anything else. Your shocked right? But, its true. From Red Zones, to Leek Spins, to Squidwards, Mario loves those videos that are done over and over again. His favorite fad of all was the Sparta Remix. Although some of Mario's Sparta Remixes insulted Tyrannosaurus Alan & George Volcano. When Nintendo heard that they had been made fun of, they were hacked and the hacker read every true thing about Nintendo, (and believe me, there's lots of secerts about Nintendo.) they tried to ban Mario's account (MushroomMarioMan). But after hearing that the account was the original Mario's, they were all in a coma for at least 2 months. Miyamoto was blamed for going on YouTube in the first place and he was sent to jail for 5 years to be replaced with Michael Jackson. Mario laughed at Nintendo about this.His Involvment In The Katsu War  Mario was a human shield in the Katsu War, daving Bario, Deidara and the Soviet Luigis from Weegee and his German Weegees. He used a Force-A-Nature, one of his favourite weapons. He also created a replica of the Revival Machine to revive Bario.Two Years Later...  Two years after the Katsu War, Mario was seen fighting Bowser, who he had defeated easily, indicating his new strength. Reflux the Knaaren informed George W. Bush about his partner's defeat, who called Mario \"The bestest threat for the f00ture\". Mario then went to Dr. Rabbit's palace and killed him, taking the base for himself. Mario has not been seen, until he recently left revealing he just needed to make a really big poop.Meeting Chef Pepper Jack and Wolfgang  Mario randomly decided to rob some banks and eat all the money. Tony Abbott put a bounty on his head and bounty hunters/ doom raiders/ the idiotic chili guy and his equally idiotic werewolf friend/ skylanders villains Chef Pepper Jack and Wolfgang were set to collect. While Mario was busy robbing some random bank Chef Pepper Jack and Wolfgang came and attacked him. However, Mario easily defeated them and Chef Pepper Jack as a tasty snack, hinting that he likes chili. But, unbeknownst to Mario, Chef Pepper Jack and Wolfgang were only 2 of 11 doom raiders and the other Doom Raiders planned their revenge...Enemies  Koopas:These sneaky turtles are spread all over the place in every Mario game. They come from a poor\u00a0hood\u00a0where nobody has heard of\u00a0birth control. So there are thousands of them, and they are all\u00a0thugs\u00a0because they never got proper attention from their parents, who were busy snorting\u00a0coke. Some walk the ground, while others have pimped out their shells to have wings. Others have had their feet modified to allow them to jump abnormally high, like Kenyans. But all of them share one thing - they hate\u00a0Italians. And\u00a0Mario\u00a0is just about as Italian as they come, so they're always trying to taunt him with\u00a0lewd gestures\u00a0and\u00a0bad language. Mario can take them out easily enough by jumping on them a couple times. Sometimes, for added humiliation, Mario will rip the shell off the dead body\u00a0and use it to beat the crud out of others. This is a trick that Mario picked up from the hood, from his ring leader Luigi.Spiny: These little cruds are thrown from the sky. They run around on the ground, trying to steal all your money to buy drugs. Their shells are usually fitted with metal spikes, and trying to jump on them like other enemies usually gets Mario a nasty bruise, or even\u00a0killed. However, Mario can get the BFG upgrade and kill these enimies like it's his job. Or he can rip the shell off of one of the Aholes and beat them to death with it.  Pirahna:These nasty little immigrants live in the sewers. They don't really bother anybody, but since Mario is on probation for selling drugs, it is his job to clean out the sewers from all the scum. The Pipe guys don't like this, and make every effort to bite Mario in the butt whenever he gets close to the pipes. Some of these ememies have bought automatic weapons from\u00a0Crystal Meth\u00a0addicts, and fire them at Mario when he is close to the sewer. Since these pipe alien guys have\u00a0acid\u00a0for\u00a0blood, Mario cannot jump on them for risk of ruining his new kicks, so he must shoot them also with the BFG. Goomba:They're really spaced out and just walk around all the time and get on everybody's nerves. They never look where they are going, and are always being run over by cars or even falling into holes in the ground. Being the careless morons that they are. Since they are too lazy to ever wear pants, they will transmit their nasty brocolli-head disease to you upon contact, and you will die. Red Platforms: These are perhaps the most cleverly disguised enemy. Mario doesn't even know that they are out to kill him...until it's too late. They are magical creatures capable of flying and being stepped on. They will try to seduce Mario into stepping on them by flashing their\u00a0tits\u00a0at him and making promises of giving the\u00a0reach-aroundwhen it's all over. Just when Mario is lured into the trap, they pull away and leave only an empty pit of death for Mario to fall into. Mario cannot kill these bastards because they are reinforced with\u00a0red, and are the personal property of Mario's business partner (Bowser the Pimp). Lakitu:  Watch out! These fly around in the sky. They also enables them to ride on clouds. It is possible sometimes for Mario to climb up on top of cars and overhangs and jump on these bastards, but its very difficult and usually not worth the risk. Instead, Mario will usually just run like a motherfucker and dodge the shit that these Assholes throw down at him until he can reach safety.Bowser: This big ugly son of a boi used to be a trusted business partner of Mario. But one day Bowser realized that Mario had a pretty hot\u00a0girlfriend\u00a0named Peach, and he kidnapped her to be his personal\u00a0slave. This made Mario really tight, and so he departed on a mission to kill Bowser and his lousy cheating girlfriend. He killed Bowser with a crowbar, and then found Peach in the next room. She thought she was being rescued, but then Mario jumped on her head and threw her into the lavaAlternative History  Oliver Stone was rumored to be making a movie based upon what he believed to be the true history of the Mario Brothers, or as he called them, the \"most shameless exhibitionists since Michael and Ron Jeremy.\" Stone then noted that Ron and Mario were surprisingly similar, and he noted the coincidence as \"eerie\". His history, however, is the following. A bunch of green dinosaurs named Yoshi (although, \"apparently\", some Yoshis were other colors) were all minding their own business when a diaper clad Mario fell from the sky, apparently victim of the abuse by the nefarious Kamek, a Magikoopa. The Yoshis all began sticking their tongues out and making cute whistling noises, wondering what the fuck to do. Suddenly, Mario climbed onto a Yoshi's back, believing the saddle that just happens to grow on Yoshis to be some sort of nip. Realizing the young Mario's yearning for tit, Yoshi bounded off with his friends to find this supposed magical thing that was beyond imagination. They soon learned from a local piranha plant (smacking his lips), that he had just had some delicious tit over at Bowser's place, as he was also a young lad in need of it. They reached the palace, and found Bowser with Princess Peach, a young voluptuous woman who Stone says is the father of Scarlett Johanssen. Yoshi helped Mario steal Princess Peach for himself, Bowser was pissed, and Mario spent the whole afternoon nourishing himself.This history would repeatedly repeat itself, as Bowser would steal back the princess, usually by force, and attempt to ravish her in any way he pleased. Bowser would usually be in some elaborate realm of castles or horizontal worlds (he had hundreds of slave koopas), and Mario, sometimes with the aid of Yoshi and secret Princess-Peach-lover Luigi (his brother), among others like the stoner Toad. Many times stoner Toad reached the princess before Mario, somehow, and would promptly annoy Mario by repeating \"Thank you Mario, but our princess is in\u00a0Another Castle\u00ae\" between hookah puffs. To this day no one ever knew where princess was... wait, does anyone really care anymore? After this Stone becomes rather vague, and this is where critics really hammer him. Apparently at one point Mario and Bowser teamed up to save Princess Peach from some dude named Smithy. Mario and Bowser repeatedly deny this, and every time it is mentioned Mario starts super punching or hammering people, and Bowser spews fiery breath. Oliver Stone heartily recounts losing his hair to one of these spews.Original Games Donkey Kong  Totally not related to King Kong in anyway, this game has\u00a0\u00a0JUMPMAN\u00a0saving the\u00a0helpless\u00a0Pauline\u00a0from\u00a0the clutches\u00a0of a\u00a0ronery\u00a0ape.\u00a0Although hes a very nice guy sometimes.Super Mario Bros.  Mario and his brother\u00a0Luigi\u00a0save the Princess from a\u00a0giant turtle. To\u00a0aid\u00a0them on their quest, they have a variety of power-ups, such as\u00a0Fire Flowers\u00a0(which cause flames to erupt from Mario's fingertips), Mushrooms (which make everything look smaller), and\u00a0Super Stars(which cause enemies to have seizures on contact). I wish I was joking, but this is the staple of the average Mario game.Super Mario Bros 2  Mario, Luigi, that annoying mushroom-midget thing, and that Peach who does nothing but scream and fly around using her ability to queef at high speeds, team up to battle a\u00a0frog. They\u00a0kill it with vegetables, but not really, because\u00a0IT WAS ALL A DREAM LOL! It's a version of another game called\u00a0Doki Doki\u00a0Panic. The original sequel was thought to be too hard for American\u00a0gamers\u00a0like\u00a0yourself.Dian Shi Ma Li  A\u00a0 compared to the main games of the series,\u00a0Dian Shi Ma Li\u00a0is a spinoff featuring a Mario clone named\u00a0Fortran\u00a0- who happens to be the illegitimate father of Weegee and Malleo. The purpose of this game is to use\u00a0imaginary moneys\u00a0and to\u00a0PUSH START TO RICH. Unlike the other Mario games, there is no end to this one. Ever. It's a shame that this particularly\u00a0awesome\u00a0Mario game was overshadowed by another, one.Super Mario Bros. 3  Considered by the fandom to be the BEST GAME EVAR, Mario and Luigi have to save seven kings who, along with being kidnapped, had their seven\u00a0MAGIK WANDS\u00a0stolen and were turned into\u00a0animals\u00a0by each of the seven\u00a0coons. However, in\u00a0World Seven, Mario finds out that those seven\u00a0kidnappings\u00a0were\u00a0all just a distraction\u00a0so Bowser could nab\u00a0Princess Toadshit. Seven seven seven.Bowser isn't the brightest bulb in the\u00a0box, but he at least deserves a\u00a0Gold Star\u00a0for effort... that is until you see what plans Bowser comes up with in the future. Then it's torn off like an old Band-Aid.Super Mario World  The same game as\u00a03, but for the\u00a0Super Nintendo. The only difference is that this time you get to ride a\u00a0dinosaur\u00a0named Yoshi AND\u00a0OMG YOU GET A CAPE INSTEAD OF A TAIL!1Mario Kart  Luigi finds out that his brother is actually\u00a0Ron Jeremy. Mario and his friends skid around various tracks in cardboard go-karts and throw shit at each other for\u00a0trophies. The original was supposed to have\u00a0two female characters and one cup. There have been sequels, but it's the same general concept of Mario and his friends throwing things at each other.Super Mario\u00a0RPG  By far, the most overrated Mario game to date. The starting plot is the same as the original\u00a0Super Mario Bros.\u00a0game So, Mario has to find some PVC glue bottles that look like bits of stars to reassemble some retarded magical dildo or some shit like that and look for the Princess. It's like\u00a0Final Fantasy\u00a0(it was made by the same company, go figure), but HE KNOWS ABOUT TIMED HITS which can be used for\u00a0MASSIVE DAMAGE. This game has spawned an ungodly amount of fanboys who practically live on praying to their God for giving them this game. Let's not forget that this game is incredibly boring since Mario can only jump in the overworld and that the puzzelda were practically made\u00a0by three year-olds or people with\u00a0down syndrome. Also the source of Geno, who is a living puppet, and\u00a0Mallow, but nobody cares about him.Mario is Missing  Bowser is up to no good again, so Mario must put a stop to his\u00a0dirty deeds!!!!111Oneoneone.  What poorly-made plan has Bowser cooked up this time to steal the Princess? None. Thank God.Instead, Bowser has set up base in the Antarctic and he plans to flood the Earth by melting it with\u00a0hairdryers\u00a0(yes, you read that correctly. Unless you read it as Hard Drivers). When Mario tries to stop Bowser's\u00a0\u00a0nefarious scheme. Luigi then has to travel around the world and answer trivia questions to save his brother. It's exactly as entertaining as it sounds. Melting Antarctica with\u00a0hairdryers? Bowser must be cheap The PC version of the game gave birth to the\u00a0meme\u00a0known as\u00a0Weegee.Super Mario\u00a069  You get a sexy letter from princess peach and she says something about\u00a0cake. At this point you should know that the cake is a lie because women can't write letters. Bowser takes over the Princess's castle (which is nothing but an\u00a0art\u00a0gallery) and hides\u00a0Power Starsin various painting worlds instead of actually doing anything with them. In this AMAZING 64-BIT\u00a0ADVENTURE, you run around collecting the Power Stars that, coincidentally, do nothing but let you progress, and fight Bowser\u00a0at least 69\u00a0times (each battle the same thing which becomes way too easy). The excellent control scheme handles like\u00a0your mom.Paper Mario  Same as\u00a0SMRPG\u00a0but every character is a piece of\u00a0paper. Bowser steals a Star Rod, gets sued by\u00a0Kirby\u00a0for copyright infringement,\u00a0wins, and decides to use it for himself. Peach invites Mario and Luigi to a party at  the castle, during which the whole castle rises up in the sky and Bowser\u00a0pwns\u00a0the crap out of Mario with his Star\u00a0Rod. OMG! So now Mario has to free some star spirits to re-own Bowser and his Star Rod, with the help of all his\u00a0partners. He has several of these partners to help him out on his contrived quest, but they are hardly notable. The series has also spawned two equally formulaic sequels of collecting seven shiny pieces of crap to kill somebody. Hoorays!Super Smash Bros  A Nintendo\u00a0fanboy's wet dream come to life. The game is basically a giant\u00a0circlejerk\u00a0of various Nintendo characters beating the crud out of each other. So, essentially, it's\u00a0awesome. It's also\u00a0one of the many\u00a0games subject to\u00a0drama.Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door  The world is once again turned into\u00a0paper, and now it's up to Mario to go collect OMGJESUS\u00a0EVEN MORE!!!!!!!\u00a0Stars.\u00a0That's right, and seven of them!\u00a0Who would've thought? But there's a twist: You can die in the overworld! OMG!!! Nintendo is really pushing the limits! There's also a guy with a fishbowl for a head who wants them so he can stick em up his butt or some other form like that. Of course, Mario also has\u00a0his girls\u00a0that join him, because apparently Mario's too\u00a0fail\u00a0to kick butt without help. Mario's\u00a0gals, in this game, are all\u00a0Aboriginal...let's see... Yes, every\u00a0female\u00a0(and possibly\u00a0male) wants inside Mario's pants, desperately (cause Italians are\u00a0smexy\u00a0:3). This fact is made painfully obvious throughout the game.Super Mario Sunshine  Set shortly after Mario's successful\u00a0Jihad\u00a0in\u00a0Super Mario World\u00a0where he destroys several buildings, Mario boards a plane headed to a distant tropical island where he attempts to hijack and crash it into a high-rise skyscraper. With Mario's\u00a0final terrorist plot\u00a0foiled, he is captured and labeled an\u00a0enemy combatant\u00a0and sent to\u00a0Guantanamo Bay. The rest of the game is spent with Mario being\u00a0interrogated\u00a0by eating meat sandwiches and getting hamered by\u00a0the Man. During his testimony, when asked why he intended to kill so many\u00a0innocent civilians, he stated that he \"did it for teh lulz!\" After being\u00a0tortured\u00a0half to death by freaks, Mario is subjected to\u00a0at least 100hours of community service in the form of cleaning up the town that the residents crud all over. Mario gets a\u00a0water cannon\u00a0and uses it to\u00a0spray\u00a0on everything\u00a0dirty.  Oh, yeah, and\u00a0Bowser's in a bathtub\u00a0this entire time. And apparently he has a\u00a0kid\u00a0too.Super Mario Galaxy  Waggle and jump around on tiny space-rocks, following a linear path to the star, jumping around on cartoony levels to appeal to the younger crowds. ...that's it. Going from point A to point B\u00a09,003\u00a0times, occasionally stopping to collect crud or take part in\u00a0\u00a0boss fights. After collecting all 120 stars, what do you get? YOU GET TO DO IT ALL AGAIN! But as\u00a0Weegee, who jumps higher but seems to have had his  shoes dunked in anal lube, which makes him slippery as god. What do you get after beating the game again? You get to go back to the starting level of the game and collect purple coins! Heck yes! If you look closely at the title look at the letters that have stars. they spell out \"U R MR GAY\" lolEasily the best\u00a0Mario\u00a0game ever made. Because of this and the fact that ever since\u00a0Neil Armstrong\u00a0landed on the\u00a0Moon, every\u00a0American\u00a0got a space\u00a0fetish, there's a sequel that appeals to\u00a0at least 100\u00a0percent of\u00a0nostalgia and rips off every other 3D Mario game\u00a0SINCE NOSTALGIA'S COOL, RIGHT?. Yoshi's in this one and eats radioactive berries that give it superpowers. And its cover says \"YA I M R U?\"Mario &\u00a0Sonic\u00a0at the\u00a0Special Olympics  Mario and his friends find some\u00a0furries\u00a0and a fat scientist, and then they compete in the \u00a0Special Olympics. Nobody gives a crap about this game now, due to Sonic in\u00a0Brawl-\u00a0HOLY Crap! THOSE Idiots ARE MAKING ANOTHER ONE!  Then they actually went on to create even\u00a0moar\u00a0of this crap, including\u00a0Mario & Sonic at the London 2012 Olympic Games\u00a0and\u00a0Mario & Sonic at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games. There's also\u00a0Mario & Sonic at the Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games, if you just needed to play as Mario or Sonic snowboarding.Super Paper Mario  Same old\u00a0story\u00a0as the first two, except in this game, Mario gets partners that\u00a0aren't necessarily dumb, but they aren't that either. This time around, he gets to team up with\u00a0Tippi,\u00a0Princess Peach,\u00a0Luigi, and\u00a0Bowser. Together, they fight\u00a0Count Bleck,\u00a0Nastasia,\u00a0O'Chunks,\u00a0Mimi,\u00a0Dimentio, and\u00a0Mr. L. It's different from the other two\u00a0Paper Mario\u00a0games in that there's less turnbased combat and more of the\u00a0awesome\u00a0platforming.Instead of Mario's, most of the\u00a0female characters\u00a0go for\u00a0Count Bleck's pants since he's the supreme god of all emos. Bleck also\u00a0doesn't succeed in destroying the universe\u00a0and reveals the power of\u00a0friendship.New Super Mario Bros  It's like every other 2D\u00a0Mario\u00a0game, but\u00a0new! There's also this\u00a0little\u00a0version of Bowser that you fight\u00a0OVER 9,000\u00a0times who sounds like\u00a0you. As quoted from Luigi, \"Go,\u00a0Weegee!\"New Super Mario Bros Wii  So it's Mario's birthday and a HUEG\u00a0cake\u00a0comes in from nowhere, everyone is pleased at the arrival of the cake but then.....Bowser's kids\u00a0come out of nowhere and put peach in the cake and take off with it! It all boils down to a\u00a0lemonparty\u00a0of all the old 2D games, but in\u00a03D!New Super Mario Bros 2  Same exact thing as the first, but with lots moar coins. After Mario gets 1,000,000 coins in total, being the self-centered ahole he is, spends it on a GIANT GOLDEN STATUE OF HIMSELF that doesn't do crud.Mario & Luigi:\u00a0Superstar\u00a0Saga  This time, instead of the Mushroom Kingdom being in peril, the\u00a0Beanishpeople of the\u00a0BeanBean Kingdom\u00a0ask\u00a0Mario and Luigi\u00a0to stop\u00a0Cackletta,\u00a0Fawful, and the Koopalings from terrorizing the BeanBean Kingdom.\u00a0In this game, the battle system is exactly the same as Paper Mario, except you can do combos and Bros Attacks. Some say\u00a0Americans\u00a0butchered the localized version by screwing up the monsters' stats. The Koopa Kids' HP are greatly reduced, making each of them able to be\u00a0killed in 1 hit, while the final boss's HP is doubled to drag out a boring fight even further. It has sequels on the\u00a0DS\u00a0that include\u00a0time\u00a0travel and\u00a0vore\u00a0and\u00a0babysockpuppets of the two.\u00a0Ya, rly.Mario & Luigi:\u00a0Partners in Time  Mario and Luigi go back and forth in time to\u00a0save\u00a0Peach because she is yet again kidnapped, this time by the\u00a0shroobs, who are purple alien toads that have evil expression on their face. You jerk around doing utter bull and find Peach after weeks of gameplay. You battle Princess Shroob to find out she's got a sister who was locked away in\u00a0crud nobody cares about\u00a0and kisses her dress in a battle that lasts\u00a0an hour.Mario & Luigi: Bowser's\u00a0Inside\u00a0Story\u00a0(Inflation:\u00a0The Game)  Fawful returns,\u00a0butthurt\u00a0over Cackletta's death in the first game, and plots to take over the Mushroom Kingdom by giving everyone\u00a0weird mushrooms\u00a0that\u00a0bloat\u00a0them up to\u00a0immobility. Then he feeds Bowser a \"Vacuum Shroom\" that makes him\u00a0inhale\u00a0the princess and the Mario brothers. The rest of the game is about tending to Bowser's\u00a0butthurt\u00a0for Fawful turning his castle into a\u00a0theater\u00a0and you have to do stuff with Mario and Luigi like going into Bowser's butt to restore his life by anally ravaging him. Srsly. There's also a moment where Boos\u00a0force feed\u00a0Bowser until\u00a0immobility.\u00a0Yeah.Trivia Mario Tag Stats Luigi  , talking about the meaning of life Luigi is a major character in too many Mario shames. Many people believe that he is you and Mario's long-lost brothers, but this is not true. In reality, Luigi got in a car crash with Mario one day, and Luigi said, \"Hey, wouldn't it be funny if we turned out to be long-lost twins?\" And Mario said, \"Holy Cheese Lovers!!! We're long-lost twins?!\" The rumor evolved from there. Luigi is known to use shrooms. Luigi first appeared in 1610 as one of the Super Mario Cookies. These cookies came years after so many fans loved the Mario Cookies. The Luigi Cookies were simply a recolor of the Mario ones. (This caused a nuclear meltdown.) Later, Luigi started appearing in the Mario shames, where he was a macho tough guy who wasn't afraid of anything, while Mario was a coward. In The Super Evil Guy Super Show!, Luigi was New Mario's left-hand man. However, in the fifteenth episode, he ate a deadly cupcake and blew up. He was replaced by New Luigi but now joined Nintendo again. He is a member of the Fantastic Four. For some reason he appears in some Pokemon and The Legend of Zelda shames.History  During the Videogame War, Nintendo didn't want to make Mario games, and instead started making games with Luigi being the star. He got his own girlfriend (Daisy) and got his own enemy (Queen Boo). After the war stopped, Luigi was forgotten again. Luigi's latest appearance is in a now cancelled TV show called George W. Bush's Idiot Adventures. Recently, though, Luigi had a mid-life crisis, decided to become an arsonist, and burnt down the Krusty Krab. The censors of the show then decided Luigi was 'too dangerous' to appear again, cancelled the show, then killed George.  When the show was canceled, Luigi turned into a dwarf planet. In Super Mario 128, Luigi helped Wario rescue Waluigi. They succeeded in the end, but Luigi was killed. He was later revived as a pickle, and has remained that way ever since. Luigi however then retired and gave his job to New Luigi. Later though, Luigi joined the Fantastic Four and became popular again and returned to Nintendo just like Mario. New Luigi was then killed. Luigi was hired by N00BZ to appear in Mario and his LOW grades: The Shake Dimension.One day, though, \u00a0Luigi got tired of being a pickle, so he made the Humanator\u00a0which turns anything into a human and came back to normal. He along with Mario\u00a0appered\u00a0in a\u00a0bonus level of Grand Theft Sesame Street where they're in Vice City and must fight\u00a0The Math Book of Evil.\u00a0Mario Tag Stats Trivia Shames Genres Nintendo's Do and Don't Shames List of Shames Malleo  Malleo is a weird version of Mario, and another one of Mario's replacements. After Mario quited to form the Fantastic Four, Malleo joined Nintendo. Malleo starred in a couple of shames, even in a show as an intern after the airing of Exit CUPCAKE. In his spare time, Malleo helped Weegee take over the world,\u00a0he was spoken in\u00a0Part 4 of The last stand against WeeGee\u00a0when a creepy fusion of Malleo, Mario and Weegee called Mawio was mistaken as Malleo. However, after Daisy killed Weegee, she then killed Malleo for good measure. Malleo somehow returned during the Second Un-Civil War in the form of Toon Malleo. He attempted to kill Bowser but was defeated when he was rammed in the face by the Halbeard, he underwent plastic surgery and robbed cheese shops in the guise of Meegee. He lived in Germany with his army of Mahziis. He is rumored to appear in Weegee's Time Machine along with his 'brother'. When he says the word \"Fire Flower\" he can turn anyone present into a... Fire Flower. He once did this to the Koopalings, who were returned to their original form by Napoleon Bonapartebutwere never seen a shame since. He stars in his own shames Super Malleo Brothers and Super Malleo Galaxy.Family  Malleo(20??-)---Weegee(20??-)----Zelda King(1811-1481)------Gay Luigi(????-????)---------Mario Head(2004-)Final Death?  In The War of the Black Crow, Malleo was the leader of one side. When Malleo and the other team were tied, he decided he wanted to kill Squidward. When Malleo was about to finish him off, Squidward took Malleo and threw him off the pillar they were on. Malleo fell to his death, never to return... He returned the one second later because he landed on a FIRE FLOWA. Apparently, he's dead now anyway......or is he? Nah, he's probably dead. However, he apparently returned once more, becoming an evil dictator, and took over several small villages with his new and improved Mahzii army. This aggregated the neighboring USSC ruled by comrade Dr. Robotnik and in retalliation, invaded Malleo's personal space. On 2 November 2009, Malleo apparently committed suicide by shooting himself in the head [1] as the red army slowly approached his bunker, destroying everything in its path (another report says that Malleo's bowles exploded while on the toilet). Despite his apparent 'final' death, he was seen in a wig and dress buying groceries, although this may have been Mama Malleo, this is unconfirmed.Weegee  Weegee was an odd version of Luigi, created by Gay Luigi's Rage. Weegee had the ability to hypnotize people when he made eye contact with them, making it easy for him to rule (starting with Nairobi, an area weak due to its lack of Adobe). Weegee then attempted to take over the world. However, Daisy, displeased with the competition, challenged Weegee to a fight. During the fight, it was revealed Daisy was immune to Weegee's stare.With her nintendo copyright papers, Daisy was easily able to defeat Weegee, and then killed him. After the fight was over and Daisy left, Shigeru Miyamoto was observed dragging Weegee's body away. Later, Shiggy dumped Weegee's body into the Cauldron of Evil. It is unknown why. NOTE:Weegee's stare was upgraded, so Daisy and the Nintendo are no longer immune. Recently, Weegee was seen fighting in the Foreign Legion. Napoleon Bonaparte revived him with the Revival Machine this made weegee immortal because he also dropped bannanas in the machine. Just like Malleo he was thrown into a German prison for no reason. He was caught by Cyber-Dee. But Walleo then returned and released Weegee. WEEGEE IS EVIL. In 2013, Weegee was revealed to be the mastermind behind a complex plot to start World War III using Pinkie Pie as his slave. His plans were eventually foiled by the heroic combination of New Mario and D0ctor Fantastic, as seen in Magnum's Mansion 2. However, he was revealed to be financially backed by the diabolical ruler of North Hell, Kim Jong Doom.Early life  Weegee was born in 1200, and the son of\u00a0Gay Luigi\u00a0(Who he later possessed.) During this time, The Spaghetti War was going on. Weegee was drafted in this war. Later in Hyrule, Weegee saw Bill Gates\u00a0(as a monkey) and befriended him. This was a trap though because Bill led Weegee to a trap and was\u00a0captured by\u00a0Link. Weegee then met\u00a0Napoleon Bonaparte\u00a0who was also captured and in Hyrule prison camp. The two teamed up to escape by releasing the Octaroks to distract Link.(Who was hungry enough to eat them.) After they escaped, they parted ways. When Weegee got home he saw that Gay Luigi had a replacement,\u00a0Mama Luigi. Enraged, Weegee went on a lotsa year killing spree. until he was killed by a Super Saiyan\u00a0Bill Cosby and\u00a0Captain Falcon.A New Weegee  In 1993, Napoleon Dynamite heard about Weegee's tragic ending. He then revived Weegee using a revive machine. Weegee, now back from the dead, needed a job. He was then hired by\u00a0Bowser\u00a0and\u00a0George W. Bush\u00a0to destroy\u00a0Mario. This never went through though because\u00a0Malleo\u00a0then told Weegee that with their powers they can take over the world.Trivia Main Page Latest Forum Main Junk Updated Shames Page  I propose our current Shames article be replaced with my rewrite.

He had the power to manipulate the minds of humans. Mario and Sonic duked it out once 10 years after the Videogame Wars. Soon afterward, some jerks gave him a new villain. Sonic used to be 16 years old, but finally, after some years, he turned 15. Ancient Geeks believe that Sonic would turn 14 on 2017, and possibly 13 in 2030. However, Sonic is dead as of February 2015. Sonic was a rival of Shaymin. Like the Mario series Sonic also had a lot of bad shames. It has been revealed that he will appear in the game\u00a0Sonic vs. Soneek. Sonic was actually slower than Speeder 1, hence the name of that robot. As Sonic grew younger over time, he looked more and more like a human and less like an actual hedgehog. It was presumed that by the end of his life, he would look like Ike, which have been bad. He has partnered up with Mario before, but they usually fight and only become friends when Bowser and Dr. Eggman team up. Recently, Sonic has been sucked through time by the Mime Eater, Sending him to his worst levels. He invited along Tails and Knuckles, thinking they were friends, but Knuckles smacked him and Tails shot him with his X-Bazooka. This time, he had no extra lives. Attendees of his funeral included stalker Amy Rose, his archnemesis Dr. Eggman, and Mario, the gravedigger. Rest in piece, Sonic the Hedgehog.Mario Tag Stats Guys  Some of these people actually LIKE Mario! Adding the Old Sino-Japanese prefix Wa- to the names automatically remakes them to haters (see video below). The term guy is a rival to the peopleworlds Hum an and the tronjiworlds Tronji.

She is as evil as every bad word you know (and some you don't know). She secretly wishes to become the Queen of the Mushroom World so she can enslave its inhabitants. She is so evil, that once she went into Toad Town with a plasma and didn't stop shooting until EVERY LAST INHABITANT was dead. Shigeru Miyamoto has stated that the goal of Super Mario 129 will be to kill her. She will appear in upcoming shame Super Princess Daisy, where the aim of the game is to take over the whole of the planet and enslave everyone. At one point, Daisy was drafted by the Association of Board Hosts. At another point, she got turned into a plant by Donkey Kong Jr, but she found a Plasma and killed him, thus reverting her into a human. Daisy is immune to Weegee's and Malleo's stares. This made it easy for her to kill them. She later got killed by King Singalong in Paper Mario 5, yet Shigeru Miyamoto revived her with the Revival Machine, without Napoleon Bonaparte's permission. She then joined the Cheese Squadron, but was soon killed by Mist Girl. Then Shiguru revived her again! Her current whereabouts is unknown.

The owners of the radio are worried since Evil Guy is, well, evil and he may attack the cameraman someday.EvilGuy 008  Although Evil Guy's show had several spinoff movies, EvilGuy 008 was the fat fiend's first full feature film. It is also distinct from Evil Guy's other media appearances because it introduces two distinctly new looks for Evil Guy: his spy outfit, which would carry over to other films, and his Evil Evil Guy transformation, which was never used again. Evil Guy plays the role of hero in this movie, despite cutting class, disobeying his father, and blowing up a space station.

However, he got lost on the way there, and ended up in the Mushroom Kingdom, where he survives on a regular diet of Milk, heroic plumbers, and the occasional appendage of one of his offspring. He once killed an innocent mario cookie. (WHY?!) Meanwhile, the casting directors had to find a replacement for him for their movie so they hired another horrible, not-so evil genetic mutation gone wrong, named Godzilla, and paid him double. Bowser was actually created by Evil Guy.Bowser's Hobbies  In addition to ruthlessly controlling the malicious Koopa army and executing all who get in his way, Bowser is the number 1 fan of the hit TV series Teletubbies; Bowser happens to be vice president of the Teletubbies Fan Club. (The president is Shigeru Miyamoto himself but he'll get revenge on him.) Bowser is 9th-in-command of the Association of Board Hosts, and, due to really disliking his placement, tends to ruin the other members' fun by crashing their parties. He also sits on Evil Guy to annoy him, as he hates him very much.Political Standings  Bowser cannot vote (nor does he have any political rights whatsoever), so he is completely lacking in preference of the United States' two political houses. He does, however, have significant political standing in that he is the ruler of the Koopa Kingdom, and also the self-proclaimed King of Sweden. His thirst for power (and apple pie) has also led him to attempt at becoming the king of the Mushroom Kingdom several times, although he has, for the most part, failed in doing so. He also rules the country of America thanks to a radio-controlled android of his known only as \"George W. nkbknllnlmlmlgbdvkbg;lfsb, and he has a high rank in the country of France as the main sponsor of the Foreign Legion.The Great Videogame War  During the Great Videogame War, Bowser was shot dead by Tails Doll . He knew it was coming, he just wanted to risk playing Can You Feel the Sunshine backwards outside his castle at 1 am. He was later revived, reluctantly, by his ally, Mario, and his head reassembled with Sellotape.Appearence in Shames  Bowser has appeared in many shames over the years.Super Mario & Wario Moonshine  During the development of Super Mario & Wario Moonshine Bowser and the Elite Team o' Terror got into a fight with Shigeru Miyamoto and whenever there was a cutscene involving the bad guys, everything would turn into cartoons. At the end of the story, Bowser is shown forcing DINNER down his minions throats becasuse of their failiure to kill Mario. He is revealed to have certain feelings for Dolphin Island.Super Ronald Galaxy  Bowser appears in Super Ronald Galaxy, working for The King and Colonel Sanders. He first appears as the boss in the third boss level, Colonel Sander's Hot Sauce Reactor. Bowser appeared to die after Ronald McDonald knocked him into the hot sauce surrounding the area. However, he later appear as a mini-boss alongside Waluigi and Colonel Sanders in the final boss level, The King's Restaurant Reactor. However, he appears to be killed when the Restaurant Reactor explodes. An easter egg in it has been found with bowser as a shooting star.Grand Theft Sesame Street  Bowser appered wanting to destroy Sesame Street. Elmo decided to kill him, manly cause he took his sandwich. After killing him, he had a clone that was called, Eviler Bowser who was 90% more eviler than Bowser. He wanted to destroy the world but,\u00a0Elmo killed him. Then, he had another clone called Super Evil Bowser which was 99.999% more eviler than Evil Bowser. This Bowser wanted to destroy the universe and was unstopable to any weapon! Elmo learned you have to say how nice he is to kill him, he dies and turns back into normal Bowser.Bowser's Family  He made himself because idk how that works and he watches teletubbiesWife and Children  Currently, Bowser is father to seven kind young gentlemen as well as another darling little boy. All of these children were actually offspring of his cousin, and Bowser adopted them. Bowser is wed to the aptly-named Bowser's Wife, who has an undying hatred of him due to his childhood wish of marrying Princess Peach (which he, as stated above, has not given up on).Uncle  Luigi is also Bowser's uncle, as seen in the Mario Party 6 name \"Green Bros.\" awarded to a team consisting of Luigi and Yoshi (Bowser's father). Strangely, though, Nintendo has officially announced that Mario is not Bowser's uncle along with his brother, as he was merely adopted by his mom.Sister  Template:Main In a bizarre event in episode 27 of The Super Wario Bros. Wah-wah Show!, a portal to an alternate dimension opened up; out of this portal stepped a bovine-like, female version of Bowser. This creature, who claimed to be called \"Cowser\", soon identified itself as the sister of an otherworldly incarnation of Bowser. Bowser soon formed a bond with Cowser; however, Wario had eaten most of Cowser's active body by the end of the episode. Cowser never appeared again, although she was given several references by utterings of Bowser in later episodes, and, despite her status as dead, she even wrote a letter to the Koopa King in the episode \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Goombas Attack\". Cowser also appeared in the opening sequence of the NES version of Mario is Finally Missing! as a nameless agent of Bowser. This appearance, in which she said nothing, showed her to be almost bull-like (and therefore possibly male), although the character shown was clearly Cowser.Brother  Boswer is actually Bowser's clone that the Evil Guy made in hopes that he would obey him. Boswer escaped, but was unable to find something to do with his life due to him being too picky on what job he had. In the end, he worked for Bowser until Hitario pushed them into nuclear waste and they fused. They looked exactly the same, except on the back of their shell, the words \"KICK ME\" were there for some reason.Distant Cousin  Bowser also has a cousin named Nedzer. An extreme geek, and an unusually kind person, he was cast out of the Bowser family. He eventually founded \"Nedzer Enterprises\", though it was bought out by Bill Gates so he could control the computers of the Mushroom Kingdom. Nedzer was the star of his own game, \"Send That Fax\", considered one of the greatest shames NintenDO ever produced.Alter-Ego  In the show Everybody Loves Bowser, Bowser drinks some bad milk and turns into Giga Bowser. This makes him behave like a posh and psychotic Freak with a balloon called Winston. In Viva la France! a portal manifests and Giga Bowser breaks away from Bowser's sub conscious. In later epidodes he gets thrown into an Angry Sun, gets eaten by a Goomba, and starts selling Pickle's. He appears in Super Mario & Wario Moonshine as the final boss. When he obtains an uber powuh form, you must chase him round a bathtub. In the end he appears to drown in Moonshine, but an anyomious source says that he appears in Mario & Luigi: Teh 4w3s0m3 Adventure as a communist.Grandma  Grandma Bowser claims to be Bowser's grandma, but she is more likely Wowser's cousin, and thus is really Bowser's great Aunt.Dark Version  Bowser also has a dark version, Dark Bowser. Dark Bowser was created when Bowser's essence and Wowser's essence were spliced by the Darksaber. <br clear=\"all\"Mario Tag Stats  Strength: 4.8/5 Speed: 1.8/5 Jump: 2/5 Special ability: 3.2/5Trivia Wario  Wario (also known as a Fartudinous Lump of Poo) is Mario's evil twin brother and first appeared in the 1600s as a terribly mutated Mario cookie. However, George Bush started making more to make money and acquire minions. Once, Wario has replaced Mario and has starred in his shames, such as Super Mario 128.,but was soon fired after Nintendo discovered he was a member of the X-Men crew. He also wrote the song Fat. In Super Mario & Wario Moonshine, Wario had taken up going around like a maniac and one faithful rage led him to be reunited with Mario. They gained uber-powuhs and he became Wario-Man, the violet garlic. He is revealed to be very smart despite the fact he lost in an IQ test to George W. Bush. This maybe because the game was half-developed by a company in PHILLIPS. Wario has claimed to have shoved many things in his infinite butt including 17,000 slices of Toast, a copy of the fake Legend of Zelda Trailer and even Paris Hilton. Wario directed his first game ever, Grand Theft Sesame Street. Next he would direct movies made by Pixor, such as Porn Story, Retards Inc., and his own Finding Wario.Mario Tag Stats Early Life  Wario was born in Old Forge Pennsylvania, the dirty Whop capital of the world, before relocating to near\u00a0Yoshi's Island\u00a0(where his parents dropped him off hoping that he would be picked up by the island's high-quality educational system). This is chronicled in\u00a0Yoshi's Island DS. Unfortunately, due to Wario's\u00a0flatulent\u00a0properties,\u00a0the residents\u00a0attempted to sell him on\u00a0eBay\u00a0for rougly $2.00, with the description calling him \"Willy McToot-Toot's off-spring\", and them kicked him out into the\u00a0woods\u00a0when this plan backfired. After ten years of gathering stench, Wario found a video game company that would support his desire to become famous and rich. Producing \"WarioWare\" and other games, Wario also found that he had a cousin, also in the video game industry, Mario, whom Wario became rabidly jealous of. This sent him spiralling into despression and he became a crazed drug addict who now lives in Los Angeles. Wario still manages to produce games, creating such titles as\u00a0\"Shoot the Hooker and Run\"\u00a0and\u00a0\"Wario Sex Oddysey\"\u00a0for\u00a0Wii. He likes shouting\u00a0WWWEEEAAA\u00a0at Mario.   Wario had been trying to kill Mario for 20 years,then when he got drunk,he made a gaming company and hired a Pimp named Jimmy Testicles and his bro Jimmy Penis and hired a whore from a pizza restaurant named Mona the Slut,an alien player named Orbulon,a kewl pimp named 9-Volt and his homie 18-Volt, a swinger named Young Cricket, a bitch named Ashley, two hitmen named Dribble and Spitz, a crazy wild-eyed scientist who claims to be neutered named Dr. Crygor with a whiny niece named Penny and a robot named Mike, and two Japanese hotties named Kat and Ana.After going through many failed relationships, Wario began to feel hopeless and unloved. He started to experiment with illegal drugs and eventually became addicted to crack. During this time, relationships with his friends and family began to crumble. His video game obsession took over his life and soon all he did all day was play his microgames. He began to neglect his own personal hygiene and he became so disgusting that no one wanted to hang around with him. After seeing a psychologist, Wario was put on zoloft which had the odd side effect of making him a greedy freakin' boi. Not able to reconcile with his loved ones, Wario moved from his old home in the Mushroom Kingdom to Diamond City, Arkansas where he began a new life and got new friends so that everything was all right and none of the other stuff that happened before mattered. He took to heavy drinking and started the\u00a0Battle Of Dolphin Island Soon Wario met a shiny Froslass named Minerva (she is the same Froslass in Robotnik's tape, isn't that obvious), who was working as an exotic dancer at the time. They had been dating at his new home in Diamond City. In January 16, 2008, Wario proposed to Minerva and Minerva consented, which made Wario very happy. They had gotten married in Tbillisi, Georgia, because Minerva was born there. 9 months later, they had Human/Froslass triplets, Jayce, Lepus, and Warriorette. The couple is now living happily in Diamond City and Minerva is pregnant again. By the way, Wario is still obsessed with video games, but limits his intake to one game a day to be with his family. lol!His Death  One Day, Wario logged into\u00a0YouTube\u00a0and was commenting on how he literally crap himself when the\u00a0AVGN\u00a0popped out and yelled \"ASS!\" in his Nintendo Power episode. Then his stomach growled, so he got up and headed for his fridge, but stopped when he heard a kitten meow at the door. So he waddled over to the door and opened it. He thought of making kitten burgers out of it, but then he remembered an article he read on\u00a0kitten huffing. He grabbed the cute little ORANGE Kitten and brought him over to his cutting board. He huffed all of the little guy's soul he could. Then he obtained an addiction. He died on January 1, 2009 because of too many Orange kittens While\u00a0kitten huffing\u00a0is the most proveable cause of Wario's death, some people come up with the crazy idea that his demise was a result of his extreme morbid obesity. The story goes like this: one day Wario was on the prowl for more kittens to huff when he approached your friendly neighborhood crack dealer to ask him if he had any orange kittens. But the dealer had already huffed his kittens, and mistoke Wario for a pissed off diabetic snowman and got the fuck out of there before it ate him. Wario, going into a kitten withdrawl, then decides to eat something/someone, and rather than devouring the nearest solar system as he usually does, goes to get an equally satiafying meal at\u00a0McDonalds. Wario waddles his fat ass into the McBuilding and orders the fattiest, most lethal thing on the McMenu,...a McSupermegatriplearterycloggerdeluxedoubleburgerwithbaconlardforbunsYOUWILLDIEbigassmothersizedcheeseburger with fries and a large Diet Coke. After enlisting the help of the entire population of\u00a0Mexico\u00a0in order to lift the thing, Wario receives his meal and on the way to his table grabs 60,219 ketchup packets and uses an unfortunate McEmployee as a seat. But since Wario IS fat, he simply absorbs the burger through his skin and digests it. Immediately afterwards, the combined mass of the burger and Wario creates a point of infinite density inside his stomach and spawns a black hole from his mouth, forcing everything within a 30 lightyear radius down his throat. Since Wario can eat anything, this does not kill him as he swellls to the size of a small galaxy. Wario then succumbs to the coldness of space. He receives a fatal blodclot after he dies.Trivia Main Page/Alternative  Welcome to the Un-Mario Wiki, the Mario no-ledge-base that anonymous can edit. \nThis site is better than the MarioWiki... the MarioWiki is a bunch of fake stuff!

He replaced Mario for a while but then Nintendo hired Cario, later Hitario then Wario and finally went back to Mario. He has a brother named New Luigi. In The Super Evil Guy Super Show! he is one of Evil Guy's main foes. In Super Nintendo Bros. Brawl, while the filming of the movie, Mario got terribly sick and had to be replaced by New Mario. However, during the filming of a stunt in a cutscene he died in Real Life. Because Nintendo didn't want to hire a new actor, they just said New Mario had died in the game and was killed by Giygas. He was brought back to life after Mario was sued for suckage. He is the only person who can wield the blue darksaber.Trivia Peach  Peach (also known as Princess Peach, Princess Toadstool, or Bimbo Head or Princess Bitch in Korean French Version) is a human (in disguise, a peach) that rules over the Mushroom Kingdom. She is notable for enslaving all the Toads in Toad Town, under the clever alias of Princess Pinch. She is a member of the Fantastic Four. She used to be married with Yoshi and both had their son Baby Yoshi until the Yoshi's Island Scandal where Yoshi escaped and Peach divorced him. Peach then married Tumble and Baby Tumble was born but after Tumble died, Peach is now girlfriend of Mario.  It's later revealed that this was just a disguise, and that the Peach everyone knew was actually the Human Peach that was in the Mario Sports and platformer games! She is the third boss in Super Smash Bros. PHAILURE. She attacks by crying, then Captain Picard blows her out an airlock. She is the girlfriend of Mario and appears in Super Nintendo Bros. Brawl. She was a close friend of New Mario, so Mario was jealous.Early Life  Princess Peach was born to\u00a0King Tiberius Stalin Toadstool\u00a0and\u00a0Queen Zenobia Aryana Toadstool, the most peaceful rulers in the history of the Mushroom Kingdom. They grew and raised her to be a peaceful ruler as a child, but when she was a teenager she fell madly in love with an older human officer in the Toadstool Army. She started secretly seeing him, and he taught her how to fight in their spare time (when they weren't angrily making out, of course). But over time, the young man grew higher in rank in the army, and he and Pauline had less time for each other. This led to a very sad and defining event in Pauline's life about a year later.One day, while out on\u00a0border patrol, the young man was ambushed by a gang of illegal immigrant Koopas trying to get into the prosperous Mushroom Kingdom. He was beaten and killed on duty, and the perpetrators were never identified. The Princess was never the same after this incident.Princess Peach, 10 years old and\u00a0grief-stricken\u00a0by the loss of her lover, became queen of the\u00a0Mushroom Kingdom\u00a0on a dark, rainy September 11, 2001. She didn't do much for several years; she merely acted as a puppet\u00a0monarch\u00a0for the Council, who \"guided her to the right choices\", often to their own benefit. Peach's parents both died from poison mushroom intake in what was deemed an assassination; the culprit was found to be a rebellious Koopa\u00a0nationalist\u00a0named Koopes who wanted more rights for the Koopa minorities in the Kingdom. This is believed to be what pushed Peach over the edge, into an insane, yet brilliant, revival of the Mushroom Kingdom not seen since King Toady III. She had him executed, and ever since she had a vicious hatred of all Koopas. She enacted\u00a0segregatory\u00a0laws against them, and exerted her powers over the Council until finally, on March 17, 2002, she declared war on the neighboring Koopa nation, Koopaia. She started spreading anti-Koopa\u00a0propaganda\u00a0and attempted to make herself look like the victim to win over people. She went so far as to change her name to \"Princess Peach,\" despite the fact that she was no longer a princess nor yet a peach.Leadership  Peach's rule is a very belligerent one fraught with\u00a0military actionand discrimination against Koopas and their ilk, but it has also brought a level of prosperity to the kingdom not seen in ages. While her parents' rule wasn't bad, Peach dramatically\u00a0increased the size\u00a0of the ITA, increased the level of imports to the country, and even installed her own sister, Daisy, as a\u00a0puppet\u00a0queen of the neighboring Sarasaland; thereby increasing her influence in the world even more.Culture  The\u00a0culture\u00a0of the Mushroom Kingdom has thrived under Peach's rule, but at a cost to minority Goombas and Koopas, who are regularly discriminated against. While this is not immediately evident to any passer-by or tourist, it becomes more obvious upon looking at the\u00a0living\u00a0conditions and rights of Toads and comparing them to the minorities; Goombas and Koopas are segregated from wealthy and middle-class Toad neighborhoods and put into separate townships. They are still allowed in the same\u00a0public spaces, but they live at a lower standard at home.Military  After the death of her parents, Peach increased the size of the army by almost 620,000\u00a0infantrymen\u00a0(mostly Toads and Goombas), cavalry (mostly Toads), and heavy artillery (mostly Flying Koopas and cannons) units. She also increased security in\u00a0Toadyo, the capital city, and used her armies to declare many wars on neighboring nations. While her country started out\u00a0small, it engulfed the other small countries around it and grew to be a major power. Peach then split her country into different sectors, or \"worlds,\" as she carved her empire, and gave them very creative and original names such as World 1, World 2, etc. These \"worlds\" were then subsequently divided into sub-sectors, i.e. World 1-1, World 1-2, and so on. This ensured that her country was as\u00a0difficult\u00a0to govern as possible, because nobody but her would want to memorize all the provinces she made; thus nobody wanted to have her throne. This tactic wasn't necessarily good, of course, but it all made sense in her\u00a0head. The commander of the ITA is Toadsworth Kinoji (\u30ad\u30ce\u723a), adviser to Princess Peach after her parents died. Toadsworth was responsible for the genocide of Koopas in Koopaia in a campaign in 1978, where 30 million Koopas, Goombas, and other non-Toads are gassed, tortured, placed in cruel experiments, beheaded, de-shelled, crushed or sliced in Koopatraz Island, 160 km (100 miles) off the south east coast of Toadyo. Thousands of Toads who opposed Princess Peach's regime ended up in the same fate or escaped to neighbouring Sarasaland, seeking asylum to enter the country.Industrialization  Princess Peach accelerated the rate of industrialization with enormous five year plans the first in 2008. Under her watch, the Mushroom Kingdom became the worlds most industrialized country. Among the companies founded were US Steel, GM, and Howard Johnson, symbols of the Kingdom's industrial might.Appearance  Peach nearly appears in every Mario Bros game ever made. It all started around 1985 when she was the damsel in distress captured by the evil monster Bowser. The game was so popular that Nintendo realized they could cash in on that same plot premise over and over again. In every Mario Bros sequel, Peach ends up being captured by Bowser and Mario has to jump on turtles and eat mushrooms that make him 50 feet tall to rescue her. However, in some games she gets a different role. Like, in Super Mario Bros. 2 you can actually play as her. Controversy arose when Peach was represented as an ineffective novelty character in Super Mario Bros 2. Theories on the cause differ, from the game being a remake of Doki Doki Panic to Mario being unaware of Peach's true omnipotent nature and not dreaming of her as powerful. Who dreams about their girlfriend picking vegetables for four hours, anyway?Super Mario 128  WARNING: This page has been rated by the ESRB! Super Mario 128 is the first shame since Super Mario Palette Swaps to have both Mario and Luigi in it. Well, actually since Mario wasn't with Nintendon't at that time, Wario replaced him.Story  Evil Guy, and his assistant, Pickle, kidnapped Waluigi during the Yoshi's Island Scandal. As that event was going on, Mario was killed in the Toad Revolt, leaving it up to a dwarf planet named Luigi and a larger planet named Wario to save the day. The final Boss is Evil Guy. In the end, Evil Guy and Pickle are defeated, but not before they destroy Luigi. Luigi comes back as a pickle, and Waluigi stays missing. The reason why they kidnapped Waluigi is unclear, but it was probably because they thought he was Peach. It was also unclear why would Luigi decide to save his foe, but it is possibly for the same reason that Evil Guy and Pickle thought he was Peach.Charaters  Mario Luigui Wario Waluigui PeachLevels Controls  Interestingly, Luigi and Wario are not directly controllable. Instead, the player must use mind control on Dora the Explorer and have her slap Luigi and Wario with a bacon whip to make the two heroes move. This form of gameplay has proved to be very popular; Nintendo has also considered making a bacon-themed controller for their new and upcoming Nintendo Wee, which Super Mario 128 will be featured for. Players will be able to move the bacon controller to affect in-game movements.Development  The first mention of Super Mario 128 came when Shigeru Miyamoto was sitting on his couch one day. He then turned on the television and watched Teletubbies, his favorite show. Then he had some ice cream. As he was doing this, his pet rat came up with the idea to make a Super Mario 128, but then died of hypothermia when Shiggy fed him ice cream. NOT INTO THE PIT, IT BURNS!Sequel  A sequel is in the making for this shame, titled Super Mario 129. It is presumed that it will fail 129 times harder.Mario Mart  WARNING: This page has been rated by the ESRB! Mario Mart is a shopping and racing shame. It is a spin off of\u00a0one\u00a0of the\u00a0Mario Fart games. The player races through many stores in a mall to spend the most amount of money. It has many features, including one which is unlockable. The game had a story mode, in which an ad came up on TV, saying whoever could buy the most useless stuff would get a 5636% discount on all items. Getting a useless item will boost the player's speed, while getting a non useless item will slow the player down. As the game was famous, this game had a site, toys, and 15,000 tons of cheese. However, after the game got boring, Mario Mart's site went down, the toys\u00a0exploded very loud,\u00a0and the official artwork was lost down the sewers. It has a rival, Mario Kart.Playable characters Unlockables Characters Cups Courses Clean Cup Eattime Cup Magazine Cup Coffee Cup Special Cup Thomas Cup Green Pig Cup Poop Cup TF2 Cup Crappy cup Train Cup Controversy  Many bronies were pissed off because there were no cups for Applejack and Rainbow Dash while the rest have their own cups. This caused a riot at Nintendo's office demanding a cup about them. What they got is literal cup with Applejack and Rainbow Dash's cutie marks thrown at them. their response was \"THERE. HERE'S YOUR CUPS. NOW GIVE THEM TO APPLEJACK AND RAINBOW DASH!\"Sequel  A Sequel is planned for release in 1 minute.

THIS REMAKE WILL HOPEFULLY BE BETTER THAN THIS VERSION. GO HERE TO SEE IT: The Super Wario Bros. Wah-wah Show! (REMAKE) The Super Wario Bros. Wah-wah Show! is a television show that aired in the 1970s and early 1980s. This show featured the X-Men crew and the Koopa Mafia killing each other up with guns, bombs etc. This show was based on the famous World Wars and the Videogame War. The show is very popular, but not so popular as The Adventures of SMK TV, the sequel of the even more popular SMK TV. This show was very violent and was meant for people 21 and up because of its violence, blood, use of guns, swearing, and some other themes. This show was a favorite by critics, and was going to have its final season in the year 2084 however in 1982 one of the episodes contained so much bad stuff it was cancelled, and replaced with The Super Wario Bros. Strike Back!, which was aired in 2001 after numerous delays. In 2003, the show also returned with the Internet Season and was successful, though it had not many views compared to the sequel show due to the substandard video streaming at the time, so it was cancelled after only one season.Theme Song  Hey paisanos! It's The Super Wario Bros. Wah-wah Show!

Wah-wah-wah Show! for it's brutality and references to infamous and harsh crimes. Some of the controversies are listed:Trivia Yoshi  Yoshi is a creature who is 50% pickle, 20% dinosaur, 10% donkey, and 20% dragon who is perhaps best known for his participation in the Yoshi's Island Scandal during the late 1900s. He is a fan of Weird Al.  He was once almost ate Princess Peach however during the scandal escaped and his dinner left so he could go with Mario. He now lives with his wife Birdo and 1,000 kids. Despite all of this, he is a member of the Fantastic Four after escaping prison. He loves collecting guns and shoots people as a hobby. Yoshi got mutated once right before the release of Yoshi's Book, where he fell into toxic waste and made him go through vocal loss, which also affected his voice, and became known as New Yoshi. Before Yoshi was transformed, that epic fail plumber tried to drop him of a cliff.Trivia The Koopalings  The Koopalings are the first 7 \"children\" of King August'us September'us October'us November'us December'us January'us February'us Koopa, they used to be in some Mario Shames that you won't care about and they haven't appeared in a game since 20 minutes from now, it is belived that Bowser Jr. overshadows them, but this is untrue since in reality, they have more fans than Waluigi, Pickle, Malleo, Nobody and Dub-ya. They claim to be haters but they are also Freaks due to their... Unusual habits.Stuff They Did Sonicman: The Black Knight  Strangely they first made an appearance in Sonicman: The Black Knight as recurring bosess. After they are defeated they turn into flowers. (while making a little \"Poof\" at it) They were later beaten up by Batman which caused them to go mad. In their first appearance they all looked like Penguins and all kept reappearing in the word \"Bleooow\" over and over again. This maybe because Shigeru Miyamoto's pet rat is sometimes known as Sir Bleeoow Mcfredricinson toaster Septmberous Juliacovinson III.Cardboard Mario: The Clogged Warp Pipe  The Koopalings appear in this game doing strange stuff when the heroes come along and have a long and very boring battle with them. They all have the same movements and attacks and each does 29374 damage to you so Mario threw them into Milk but they somehow survived. They seemed to be made of polestyrine in the game instead of cardboard for some reason in the game. Larry didn't appear. It was revealed in a future game that he had joined forces with Wario to defeat the Haters. They were first named in this Shame.Obey Wario, Destroy Mario! 2  Larry Koopa made an appearance in Obey Wario, Destroy Mario! 2 as a boss on the Haters side. He fights you in Dinosaur Land by balancing on a Giant Goomba and trying to push the player in to a huge bowl of Custard. He hates Wario because he hypnotised him to make a pantomie with a bunch of moles. He gets kicked to the moon after you use a special uber attack 500 times. After this, Bowser locked him in a cupboard with Weegee. After 67 years in suspended animation they arrived to be in another Shame...Mario And Luigi Superstar Shmaga  In Mario And Luigi Superstar Shmaga, it turns out in a bizarre twist that they have sued Bowser for mistreatment and so Cackletta adopted them. But it turns out that she is even worse than Bowser so they run away. Mario and co. beat them up anyway and push them out of Bowser's giant Cookie fortress. Roy slaps you, Lemmy sacrifices himself to Satan, Wendy sits on you, Morton shoots at you, Ludwig chases after you in his pimpmobile, Iggy attempts to stab you brutally with a knife and Larry uses kung-fu. Bowser re-adopts them at the end of the story, much to their, well, disliking. Duh.Personalities  There are over 517 Koopalings although 509 of them are Mini-Bowsers who like Waffles and speak with French accents. The most prominent are the eight were talking about, the 8th can be found here.Trivia Bowser's Wife  Bowser's Wife is Nintendo's least popular star, and is also Bowser's wife.Childhood  Bowser's Wife was created when Bowser's and Peach's DNA were mixed. She was called Bowser's Wife because her step-parents thought she was made for no other use. Her step-parents were very poor but Bowser's Wife had everything she wanted because she was robbing banks. Soon she was as rich as Queen Elizabeth. Bowser's Wife was soon very fat and she was too lazy to do anything. She grew up and became a very spoiled brat.Living with Bowser  This was Bowser's Wife ultimate goal. Bowser doesn't like Bowser's Wife, Bowser just wants to have someone to argue with. Bowser Jr. really wanted a mom so he kidnapped Peach but Mario got away with Peach. Then when he met Bowser's Wife, Bowser Jr. was so happy that he started to cry. Then Bowser came and he shouted on Bowser's Wife but then she kissed him.Death  there is no death.

Overview \u00b7 Wiki tutorial \u00b7 Rules \u00b7 Help pages \u00b7 Navigation Fawful is a character and reoccurring antagonist that appears in the Mario & Luigi series. He first appears in Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga where he serves as the right-hand man to the main antagonist of the game, Cackletta. Throughout the game, Fawful is usually seen by Cackletta's side and is quick to aid her in her quest to awaken the Beanstar. However, their plan was foiled after it turned out they didn't steal Princess Peach's voice and Fawful himself was later defeated at the end. Cackletta soon followed suit. Even though it appeared that Fawful exploded in the first game, he makes his return in Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time where he can be found underneath Princess Peach's Castle running his own bean shop. However, only Baby Mario and Baby Luigi can access this area and Fawful doesn't recongize them as the baby versions of the two plumbers that defeated him before. Though Fawful aggrees to trade rare items for beans to the babies, he says he soon plans on making a comeback and will try to take down the Mario Bros. This all soon comes true as Fawful makes another return in Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story now as the main antagonist. His plan involves using a disease called the Blorbs to disctract everyone so he can untimely use Princess Peach to awaken the Dark Star. This time, Fawful has to deal with Bowser along with Mario and Luigi. Fawful is a very popular character outside the series due to his over-the-top behavior and use of Engrish metaphors. Fawful, much like Bowser Jr., is well known for his many machines and inventions that helps him on his evil quest. His most used one his arguably his headgear that allows him to fly, steals the souls of people and can transfer it into others, aid him in battle, and even steal health of others. Fawful rarely fights without his headgear except for the second and last fight with him in the first game. His powers expanded greatly after absorbing the Dark Star into him but even with all of this power, he was defeated for good at the end.Mario Party 9 review Date:19/8/17 Rating:9.9/10  Hi MarioWiki users! I loved Super Mario Galaxy and Mario Kart Wii. Anyway, I had a chance to review my second favourite game, Mario Party 9. I am called Derekblue1, and this is my review! Let's get started! I watched one of the videos in with the whole Mario Party 9 mini-games. I had some interest in this Wii game, so I bought it with excitement! The cover is really attractive, it has many appealing characters! As the plot goes, Bowser and Bowser Jr. stealing the Mini Stars is much of the climax. I love the part when saving the Mini Stars, another climax again! Most mini-games were easy for me, I had so much fun. No matter if you don't win, we have fun! However, Board games were somehow hard. Thank you Nintendo! In my opinion, you should buy this instead of Mario Party 10!Super Mario Galaxy review Date:6/4/17 Rating:8.8/10  Super Mario Galaxy was a great game. It featured a lot of new objects and a different perspective of adventure. Hello, I am CoolKarim and this is my review of Super Mario Galaxy, so let's get started! This review may contain spoilers if you have not played the game or beaten the game so reading this review may be risky. So Mario goes to the Star Festival to receive a special gift from Peach and to join in the festivities, but suddenly Bowser attacks the festival and ruined it freezing toads and attacking them with his airships. Then, a UFO suddenly cuts the castle to carry it to the center of the universe. Mario tries to reach Peach, but Kamek casts a spell on Mario and sends him flying to space. So time for my review. It's pretty creative for Mario to explore galaxies and planets to rescue Power Stars leading to Grand Stars to power up the Comet Observatory. It's kind of cool that Nintendo introduces a new princess to the Mario series, Rosalina, in this game, and did I mention the graphics in this game are so good? This game has really great graphics for 2007. I'm not going to even ask how did Nintendo make this game so good. The music and soundtrack is very catchy and really great in each galaxy as it matches. This game is one of the most successful games on the Wii and overall, despite this being the 3rd Mario 3D platformer, making it earn a Nintendo Selects re-release. I like how in this game, the introduction of new power-ups. The Bee Mario power-up is a pretty nice power-up. The Ice Flower usage in this game? Amazing. The Rainbow Star, a remake of the Super Star, pretty cool. The Boo Mushroom is a fine power-up, but I don't know if it should be necessary. However, the Spring Mushroom, it's not really a great power-up, since it's hard to control with the Wii Remote and very easy to make a mistake with. Back then, the hazard, Black Hole, was a very scary hazard to die in, I use to have nightmares when I got caught in it. It's a very frightening experience when Mario would get spaghettified by a Black Hole. Those are some of the disadvantages why I rated this game 8.8/10 instead of a perfect 10. It's awesome that this successful game got a sequel with new power-ups and new galaxies to explore. There's also some hard missions in galaxies if you are trying to get 120 stars to unlock Luigi and then playing those galaxies again as Luigi to unlock the final galaxy, the Grand Finale Galaxy, even though it's just the Star Festival again and not really a galaxy. I would say that this game is quite challenging, a 6/10 in difficulty for 100% completion. Anyways, I'm pretty sure a lot of people are waiting for the third version of Super Mario Galaxy, or if Super Mario Odyssey would be a third version. Anyways, I'm CoolKarim, and that was my Super Mario Galaxy review. This game is a great game, but it can be difficult at times.Mario Kart Wii review Date:9/19/16 Rating:9.5/10  Now, since this is a review for a Mario Kart game, there isn't going to be a plot section. Anyways, my first review for a game will be Mario Kart Whee! No wait. Mario Kart Wii. So lets get started! For the gameplay, I think that the only gameplay that matches this game for all Mario Kart games is Mario Kart 8, because it is the same gameplay, except a few additions, which are not the best. Mario Kart Wii is the most realistic of all of the Mario Kart games, with the most realistic driving, and pretty good graphics. The soundtrack is pretty good, with pretty good sounds. The best soundtrack in my opinion is the Rainbow Road soundtrack. Another good one is the Koopa Cape soundtrack. And dont forget, theres also the good SNES Mario Circuit 3 song. The characters are pretty good, although Rosalina is the HARDEST character to get. You need to import a Super Mario Galaxy 2 save file. Very mean of Nintendo.Mario & Luigi: Paper Jam review Date:3/8/16 Rating:6/10  Note: If you haven't played or beaten this game yet and are planning on to, there will be some spoilers so read at your own risk! Anyways, time for my second review on a game and it's on the most recent Mario game: Mario & Luigi: Paper Jam. I will be going over things mainly the plot, the gameplay, the soundtrack, and the overall characters. Let's get started. For the plot, well, let's just say it's not the best in the series (I mean the Mario & Luigi series since this game counts more of a Mario & Luigi game than a Paper Mario one as well). It's really just two Bowsers trying to kidnap the two Peaches. The Marios (Mario and Paper Mario) and Luigi managed to rescue them midway through the game and the plot shifts over to the Bowsers bascially trying to destroy the Mushroom Kingdom. Wow...to be honest, I'm not a fan of the main plot of an RPG game that revolves around Bowser kidnapping Peach. The two games that has done this right is the original Paper Mario and Mario & Luigi: Dream Team. That's bascially it. Nothing too exciting. There is no \"unique\" antagonist to help make the story unique such as Cackletta, Fawful, or Antasma. Just Bowser and his paper self. Nothing special really. Now for the gameplay which, fortunately, is one of the good things about this game. Mario and Luigi attack with their classic jump and hammer techniques and Paper Mario does the same but a little differently and with the Y Button. A unique item called the Dash Socks allow you to run fast with all three characters making adventuring around an area quicker which a lot like. Most of the Bros. Attacks return from Dream Team especially my two favorites: Bomb Derby and Dropchopper. This game introduces Trio Attacks which can help big in enemy hordes and boss fights. My biggest grip about this game gameplay wise is the dreadful Papercraft battles. I'd say they're a horrible replacement for the epic giant fights from Bowser's Inside Story and Dream Team. They're way too easy and the camera is awful during the battles and you're most likely able to get hit from behind due to the weird camera. I like there is different Papercrafts for different fights but that doesn't make up for how easy they are. Oh, and the horrible camera. This game doesn't have any save blocks anymore so you'll have to rely on instincs and heart blocks to notify when you need to save. The finding the Paper Toads missions can get annoying too especially those guys love to run away from you... Soundtrack time. Nothing too rememberable. However, there are three I want to point out. One of them is called Come On! which is a remix of the epic enemy battle theme from Superstar Saga. I really love Superstar Saga as it's my favorite Mario & Luigi game in the series but that epic song was soon replaced by Mix-up Scramble after Paper Mario joins your team. I don't like that theme because it doesn't sound like an enemy battle theme. It sounds too...peaceful. Another epic theme comes in the form of the two final themes: Double Bowsers! and Final Battle. Double Bowsers! is a perfect penultimate theme that leads up to Final Battle which is so freaking good! I even enjoy it better than Adventure's End to an extend! However, that's pretty much it theme wise. The boss battle theme has nothing on the last games not even Partners in Time. Finally, the characters. Mario and Luigi are good as themselves and Paper Mario retains his silent behavior with indications done by hand gestures just like in the Paper Mario games which is good. However, aside from the main characters, I really like how Toadette is given a major role in this game. Toadette hasn't been seen much outside the Mario Party games so it's good she is in another series game with a major role in it. I really like how the Koopalings are finally given extended dialogue in the game! We finally get a true indication of their personalities and I'm not counting the Super Mario Bros. 3 cartoon since it's non-canonical. The Kameks were pretty good in being the sneaky advisers of the Bowsers by getting in the heroes way but the Bowser Jrs. were plain annoying. The game didn't really need them but since Bowser. Jr. is the secondary antagonist of the entire series, it makes since to include him in there (and his Paper self since he had a semi-major role in Sticker Star). Overall, Paper Jam seems like a hit and miss for me. Out of the five Mario & Luigi games, I rank it #4 since the gameplay is way better than Partners in Time's. However, it's pretty boring and reduantant plot and the easiness of this game makes it sorta lacking. It's not a bad game, it's just not good enough.By ZeoSpark  Past reviews...

Mario (\u30de\u30ea\u30aa ,Mario), (formerly and originally (under extraofficial terms) known as Jumpman, and originally developed under the nickname Mr. Video, is the titular main protagonist of the Mario series and the mascot for Nintendo. He was created by Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto, and has appeared in over 200 games. Originally, he only appeared in platform games. However, he now also features in sporting games, racing games, and fighting games and others. He is considered by many to be the most famous character in video game history, and is known to many as \"The Face of Video Games,\" having 6 games out of the top 10 on the list of best-selling video-games of all time. Mario is a short Italian plumber who lives in the Mushroom Kingdom. In the Mario series, he uses his well-known jump and combat abilities to stop Bowser from kidnapping Princess Peach and taking over the Mushroom Kingdom. Along with Luigi, has had other friends such as Yoshi and Toad. Along with Bowser, he has had other enemies such as Fawful,\u00a0Wario, and Donkey Kong. In the cartoons Mario was voiced by Peter Cullen Saturday Supercade, WWF/E Hall of Fame wrestler-turned manager the late \"Captain\" Lou Albano in The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!, Walker Boone in The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3 and Super Mario World. In the live-action movie Super Mario Bros., he was played by the late Bob Hoskins. In the video games, Mario is currently voiced by Charles Martinet.History  Mario first appeared in 1981, in the Donkey Kong arcade video game, as a carpenter named \"Jumpman.\" There are two possible theories why Mario was named such: a heated argument ensued between Nintendo's warehouse landlord Mario Segale, and the president of Nintendo at the time, Minoru Arakawa. After a resolution was brought between the two, fellow Nintendo employees chose to name the character in the game Mario, after him. There was a family-owned restaurant nearby Nintendo of America called Mario and Luigi's. Due to hardware limitations at the time, Miyamoto dressed Mario in red overalls and a blue shirt to contrast against the background. He also gave him white gloves, so that the player could see the arms moving on the screen. A cap was added so that Miyamoto would not have to animate the character's hair when he jumped up and down. However, Jumpman did not originally have a mustache. The black pixels mistaken for a mustache were actually the space between Jumpman's nose and mouth; The black was just the black background. However, fans of the game mistook it for a mustache, so in all later games and artwork, Mario was given a mustache. Mario was developed as a \"go to\" character for games that could be put in any title as needed. At the time, Miyamoto did not expect Mario to become popular. Over time, his appearance has become more defined, for example a red \"M\" in a white circle has been added to his hat, and gold buttons have been added to his overalls. He has appeared in many television programs, video releases, comic books, and a feature-length film. He has also spawned a series of branded merchandise.Biography Donkey Kong arcade games  Donkey Kong captured Mario's girlfriend Pauline due to the fact that Donkey kong loved Pauline same goes for Mario, and took her to a construction site.This motivation is also likely due to donkey kong being a wild animal alongside his instinct. Mario went on to rescue his girlfriend avoiding Barrels thrown at him by Donkey Kong and a fire started by the ape. After going through four different areas on the construction site Mario rescued Pauline and Donkey Kong was recaptured. Mario went on to imprison Donkey Kong in a cage in Donkey Kong Jr. Donkey Kong Jr. went on to try and rescue his father. Mario attempted to stop the young ape and released various types of traps mainly consisting of animals. Junior eventually did make it to his father and the two returned to Donkey Kong Island just after Donkey Kong made a shot at Stanley the Bugman's greenhouse. This was the only time that Mario was assigned as a villain. Forgetting about Donkey Kong, he meets up with his little brother Luigi, the two would be called to repair a badly damaged Brooklyn sewer line. Alone in the sewers, they would find the line to be damaged by strange creatures. The brothers would be forced to fight off the creatures in a tough battle. The brothers would, albeit briefly, see Bowser for the first time to be in charge of the creatures, but would not fight the reptile king. After defeating the creatures, Mario and Luigi would hear the voice of Princess Peach and would follow it into the Mushroom Kingdom.The Donkey Kong Show  Mario, Pauline, and Donkey Kong all stared in an animated TV show based on Donkey Kong, and Donkey Kong 3.Super Mario Bros. series Super Mario Bros.  After ending up in the Mushroom Kingdom, Mario and Luigi attempted to stop Bowser's reign of terror and defeated seven False Bowser's and free several Toads imprisoned by the False Bowser's. Mario and Luigi were then able to defeat the real Bowser and free Princess Peach, and return her to the people of the Mushroom Kingdom.Super Mario Bros: The Lost Levels  After defeating Bowser and his minions, he comes back and kidnaps the Princess again. Mario and Luigi attempt to stop him, but Bowser has set traps around the kingdom. Mario and Luigi manage to get past these traps and stop the evil king yet again and save the Princess.Super Mario Bros. 2  Mario and Luigi ended up in Subcon to end the evil Frog Tyrant Wart's rule over the land. Aided by Peach and Toad, the brothers were able to defeat Wart and free the Subcon fairies. Mario then looked for a while before returning to his sleep.Super Mario Bros. 3  Bowser returned yet again, but this time with his young children. Seven of his children took over a world in the Mushroom Kingdom that was liberated by Mario with Luigi. Taking advantage of the plumbers handling his children Bowser kidnapped Peach. Peach was later freed by Mario.Super Mario World  Bowser captured Princess Peach while she, Mario and Luigi were on vacation at Dinosaur world. On the way, Mario and Luigi met Yoshi who told them that Bowser and his children trapped his friends in castles. Mario and Luigi work with Yoshi to defeat Bowser's children, save his friends and beat Bowser once and for all. Afterwards, they save the Princess and the four continue their vacation.Super Mario 64  Mario heads to Princess Peach's Castle after he receiving a letter from her, inviting him to eat cake. Upon entering, Mario hears Bowser speaking and finds out that Peach and the Toads have been captured inside Painting Worlds that Bowser created. To save them, he enters the Painting Worlds and gathers the Power Stars that he scattered. After saving the Toads, he collected enough Power Stars and faced Bowser in combat and ended his terrible reign. Princess Peach was saved, and she thanked him with a kiss and baked him a cake. This is also Mario's first 3D debut.Mario Party series  The hero parties on with his own series of annual Mario Party series. Mario is always represented by his trademark red color. The mini-games test Mario's luck, skill, and endurance and reward him with coins. In the first three Mario Party games, Mario aimed to become the Superstar. Though Mario doesn't have many distinguishable abilities from the other Mario Party characters, the most notable difference is Mario's ability to use the Fireball Orb in Mario Party 7. Whenever Mario used an Orb on a space, the space would have Mario's \"M\" insignia. As it was revealed in the official artwork of Mario Party 4, Mario's item of choice is the Mega Mushroom. Mario's Duel Mode partner is the defensive Koopa Troopa in Mario Party 3. He also challenged by the player for the Courage Stamp if he was not selected. Throughout the series, Mario's famed jumping ability is also evened out with the other characters, leveling the playing field.Luigi's Mansion  In Luigi's Mansion, King Boo tricked Luigi into thinking he had won a mansion and was able to trap Mario in a painting. Mario was later rescued by Luigi and was freed from his painting.Super Mario Sunshine  After Luigi saved him from the painting he was imprisoned in by King Boo, Mario took a well deserved vacation with Peach and Toadsworth during the events of Super Mario Sunshine. Upon arriving on the Pianta populated Isle Delfino however, Mario was branded a criminal. Apparently, an impersonator of Mario called Shadow Mario had been vandalizing Isle Delfino with a strange type of slime called Goop. Confused, Mario took a defensive hearing of his so-called \"crime\". Using a smart portable water pump named F.L.U.D.D., Mario had to clean the whole island of Goop and return the Shine Sprites back to the Shine Gate. During this adventure, Mario also saved the many Yoshi sub-species of Isle Delfino. Mario started cleaning up the isle and found out who his impersonator was. It was Bowser Jr., Bowser's youngest son. He kidnapped Princess Peach and took her to the volcanic Corona Mountain. After Mario defeated Shadow Mario in Episode 7 of every level, Bowser Jr. flooded Delfino Square. Mario went to Corona Mountain and discovered Bowser and son, bathing in a tub of hot Slime Goop. When Mario flipped the tub upside down, they fell on to an island, and Isle Delfino was saved. Mario then was finally able to enjoy his vacation with Peach and the others.New Super Mario Bros.  Mario went back to his side-scrolling roots during the events of New Super Mario Bros. Surprisingly, Princess Peach is kidnapped by Bowser Jr., not Bowser. Mario and Princess Peach were taking a stroll around Princess Peach's Castle. On their way back, the castle was struck by lightning, possibly from Lakithunder. Mario rushed to the castle, being distracted and forgetting about Princess Peach. Princess Peach was then captured by Bowser Jr. and Mario gave chase. Mario had his classic battle with Bowser at the end of the first world, dropping him into the lava. The reluctant Bowser Jr. took Princess Peach through eight different worlds. Mario finally confronted the undead King Koopa who had become Dry Bowser, who was then defeated again. Bowser Jr. later tossed his father's skeletal remains into a cauldron and revived Bowser to his natural self and they both battled Mario together. Mario emerged victoriously and received a kiss from Princess Peach.Super Mario Galaxy  During the night of the Star Festival, Mario receives a letter from Princess Peach telling him that she is waiting for him at the castle and wants to give him something. Suddenly, Bowser invades, turning the festival into chaos. He captures Princess Peach by ripping the castle from its foundation, lifting it into space. Mario makes to the castle in time as it is lifted up trying to protect Peach. Suddenly, a Magikoopa appears and blasts Mario off into the cosmos. Later, he wakes up on a mysterious planet. He discovers a white bunny, who later is known as a white Luma. He also meets Rosalina, the protector of the Lumas. She summons the white Luma whom Mario found earlier on the planet. Giving him the Luma, Mario gains the power to Spin. He also can fly through the cosmos using items known as Launch Stars. After retrieving the first Grand Star, Mario is transported to the Comet Observatory, which acts as a hub area. Each time Mario gains a Grand Star, a new dome would open up. After gaining sixty Power Stars, Mario is able to fly to the center of the universe to fight Bowser. Bowser Jr. holds Peach captive while Mario and Bowser are fighting. Eventually, Mario lands the final blow on Bowser, sending him to the very lava of the planet he was creating. Mario then retrieves the seventh and final Grand Star. On his way to the Comet Observatory, Bowser Jr. drops Peach out of his Airship. Mario catches her at the last second. Then Bowser appears, badly hurting, either from the battle with Mario or the landing in the lava. He moans over his defeat and his crumbling galaxy. Suddenly, the Sun explodes and transforms into a black hole, sucking in everything in the universe including the castle and the observatory. Mario's Luma spurts out of his hat, saying goodbye. Then it throws itself into the black hole. All of the Lumas then go into the black hole to reverse its effect, saving the entire universe. When Mario wakes up, he sees he is back in the Mushroom Kingdom. Peach and Bowser can be seen alongside him. After the credits, it shows that Mario's Luma is safe, alive and happy on a planet that has a place that resembles the remains of a destroyed Starshroom.New Super Mario Bros. Wii  In New Super Mario Bros. Wii, Mario and his friends Luigi, Yellow Toad, and Blue Toad celebrate Princess Peach's Birthday. Suddenly, a cake appears. While the group investigates it, Bowser Jr. and the Koopalings emerge from the cake. They trap Princess Peach in the cake and ride off in the airship, dropping off Koopalings at their respective castles. After a dangerous adventure through all the worlds, Mario and his friends finally reach Bowser's Castle and fight Bowser. In a long and difficult battle, Mario throws Bowser to a chasm. But the \"Peach\" Mario saves is really Kamek the Magikoopa in disguise, who uses magic to make Bowser so big that he is virtually invulnerable. Mario must make it through the rest of the level while Giant Bowser breathes fireballs and, near the middle, jumps and creates waves of lava. Eventually, Mario reaches the real Peach and a skull switch that will drop Bowser out of the castle. When Mario exits the castle, with Peach at his side, Luigi appears in a hijacked hot air balloon, with Toads in another one behind him. Luigi offers Mario and Peach his balloon. Luigi intends to get into that balloon too, but when he tried to open the door, he fell over instead. They had taken off. Luigi then gets into the Toads' balloon. Peach then tells Mario about the secret world, World 9.Super Mario Galaxy 2  Mario appears in the sequel of Super Mario Galaxy, Super Mario Galaxy 2 where he is occasionally joined by Luigi and Yoshi to save the universe from being ruled by Bowser and to retrieve the Power Stars. Mario receives a letter from Princess Peach and goes to her castle. On his way, he finds a lost Luma, who decides to stow away in his hat, giving Mario the power to Star Spin. When he goes to the castle, he notices that Bowser is gigantic and has the princess in his hand. Mario goes after him and ends up on the Starship Mario, where he meets Lubba and his crew. To defeat Bowser and rescue Princess Peach, Mario had to collect seventy Power Stars so the Starship Mario can advance to Bowser's Galaxy Reactor. After a long fight, Mario defeats Bowser. Suddenly, Rosalina and her Comet Observatory appear before Mario and Peach. Rosalina thanks Mario for watching over the Luma that he had found, and the Luma returns to the Comet Observatory along with Mario's hat. Mario and his companions return to the Mushroom Kingdom. Mario and Luigi have the same abilities except in a few situations. Luigi runs faster and jumps higher but can't swim as well as Mario. When Luigi swims, spinning underwater takes air. This doesn't happen with Mario. If Mario obtains the remaining fifty Power Stars, he may go on a hunt for the Green Power Stars, referred to as Cosmic Jewels. Once the Green Stars have been found, Mario can travel to the Grandmaster Galaxy to get the last two Power Stars.Super Mario 3D Land  Mario appears in Super Mario 3D Land for the Nintendo 3DS. He uses several classic power-ups, the most notable of which is the Tanooki Suit from Super Mario Bros. 3. Once again, he saves Princess Peach from Bowser's evil clutches. During the adventure, Mario battles Bowser as well as two of his henchmen Boom Boom and Pom Pom. After a devastating storm, all of the Tanooki Leaves were blown off the Tail Tree outside Peach's Castle. The next day, Mario and three Toads check on the scene when they notice a floating letter. They open it to find out that Bowser kidnapped Peach while she checked the damage to the tree. Mario and the Toads then run to rescue her. While running through the worlds, he receives letters from Peach to learn about her predicament. At Bowser's castle, Mario fights the Koopa king, activating the switch on the other side of the bridge and sending Bowser into the lava. However, the area beside the castle only contains a cage lying on its side. He enters a door and finds Peach, but, upon running over to her, he finds out that it is only a wooden cutout. Bowser then emerges, carrying the real princess and flees to his second castle. After heading through another level, Mario reaches Bowser's second castle and the princess, this time tied to the flagpole. Bowser then appears, and the two begin their battle. This time, Mario has to head through a type of obstacle course to get to the bridge, and eventually the switch at the end. He pushes this, sending Bowser into the lava below. However, he then emerges from the lava, and Mario has to reach another switch in order to actually defeat him. Pushing the switch once again sends Bowser falling into the lava below once more. Mario then reappears back at the flagpole and frees the princess. Mario, along with three Toads, then use Super Leaves to get themselves and the princess back home. Sometime after that, Mario receives a letter from Luigi, depicting him in captivity. Mario runs through Special 1 and frees Luigi from Dry Bowser. Then, Peach is captured by Bowser again. Mario goes back to his castle and defeats him again. Once the player gets 5 Stars in their profile, the level Special 8-Crown is unlocked. There he faces Boom Boom and Pom Pom for the last time. When they are defeated, a giant \"THANK YOU\" is made out while Toads surround the final Goal Pole of the game.Mario & Luigi series  Mario teams up with his younger brother Luigi in this video game series. In Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga, Mario teams up with Bowser to head for the Beanbean Kingdom to get back Princess Peach's voice from Cackletta. Luigi intended to stay behind, but Bowser forced him to come along thinking Luigi wanted to join the Koop Troop. Mario and the rest are soon attacked by Cackletta's right-hand man Fawful and destroys the Koopa Cruiser into Stardust Fields of the Beanbean Kingdom. Mario and Luigi dig themselves out of the ground and press on forward. They soon find themselves playing Border Jump and are allowed further. However, Mario and Luigi manage to find Bowser but he is trapped in a cannon owned by Tolstar. Tolstar demands 10 Bean Coins from Mario and Luigi where they set out to get some. Mario and Luigi soon run into the Starshade Bros. who teaches them Bros. Attacks.Super Mario 3D World  Mario appears in Super Mario 3D World for the Nintendo Wii U. He is accompanied by Luigi, Princess Peach, and a Blue Toad in their adventure at Sprixie Kingdom to save the seven Sprixie Princesses from Bowser. Additionally, Captain Toad is playable as well, but only in his own level from each of the odd Worlds. Also, after beating the game, an extra world will be revealed, where Rosalina will join Mario and his team unlocked as a new playable character. The new power-ups in this game are the Cat Bell, which will transform the characters into the cat versions of them, and the Double Cherry, which allows them to make a clone of themselves. During their adventure, Mario and his team battle against Bowser yet again, along with his two returning henchmen, Boom Boom and Pom Pom. As they are strolling while enjoying the fireworks, Mario, Luigi, Peach, and a Blue Toad discovered a clear pipe. Suddenly, after the Mario Bros. fixed that pipe, many of the power-ups were popped out. Then, a Sprixie Princess appeared from that pipe, informing them that Bowser has kidnapped her friends in her own kingdom. Just then, Bowser appeared and kidnapped the last of the Sprixie Princesses in his own bottle and went back to the Sprixie Kingdom to conquer it. Mario and his team followed Bowser as they all arrived at Sprixie Kingdom to save the Sprixie Princesses. After defeating the boss of the castle from each world, one of the Sprixie Princess is saved and construct a clear pipe that will reveal a new path to another world. At Bowser's Castle, Mario and his team fought and defeated Bowser again by destroying his car with his own bombs and sending him to the lava. However, after saving the last of the Sprixie Princesses, Bowser survived and came back to kidnap them once more, thus revealing the final world of the game, World Bowser. After arriving in front of Bowser's largest tower, Bowser appeared and used a Cat Bell power-up to transform into Meowser. As the final battle begins, Mario and his team climbed all the way to the middle of the tower while avoiding Meowser, and sends him flying when they hit the POW block under him. But as they enter a clear pipe, Meowser returns and used a Double Cherry power-up to clone himself to attack them. As they finally climbed all the way to the top of the tower, Mario and his team finally defeated Meowser once and for all by hitting a big POW block under him, and sends him flying until he explodes as a firework. They then freed the Sprixie Princesses once more and thus saved the Sprixie Kingdom. Mario, Luigi, Peach, and a Blue Toad then used the Cat Bell as they leave the Sprixie Kingdom and went back to the Mushroom Kingdom by a clear pipe. Sometime after that, the Sprixie Princesses constructed a rocket ship that will send Mario and his team to the 4 extra worlds in space. Mario and his team ran through World Star and unlocked Rosalina to join them. Once the player collects all the stamps, green stars, and gold flags, World Crown, the true final World of the game, is unlocked. After going through the obstacles and enemies from the hardest level in the game, a giant \"THANK YOU\" are made out as Mario and his team reached the final Goal Pole in the game.New Super Mario Bros. 2  Mario returns to save the Princess, and collects a lot of coins on the way.Appearances  Mario was first seen as \"Jumpman\" in the 1981 arcade game Donkey Kong. He was first seen as \"Mario\" in the following arcade game Donkey Kong Jr. in 1982, where he was the enemy of the player. The following year, his brother Luigi was introduced in the arcade game Mario Bros. However, it was the release of Super Mario Bros. on the Nintendo Entertainment System that sparked major popularity for the character. Several sub-series have also been released. The successful Mario Kart series started with Super Mario Kart, and has become one of the most successful kart-racing franchises, selling over 30 million copies worldwide. Other sports games in the franchise include Mario Golf, Mario Tennis, and Super Mario Strikers. Role-playing games, such as Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars, Paper Mario, and Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga have also been created, along with party games such as Mario Party which have popular mini-games.Personality  Mario is basically a simple character without a solid personality since he was meant for players to integrate their own personality into his character. When his demeanour is shown, Mario is aggressive and impulsive, sometimes going head-on into things without much meditation. Despite these potential flaws, Mario is a brave and kind-hearted hero with a strong sense of justice, morality and righteousness. He puts, more often than not, other people's needs before his own, and he is willing to risk his life to save millions of others from the forces of evil. Although Mario is generally a good-natured person, it seems he doesn't enjoy losing much, often when losing in spin-off games (i.e. Mario Party) he has a sad look on his face, and in Luigi's ending in Mario Power Tennis he seems to be congratulating his brother, but he intentionally steps on Luigi's foot because he lost to him in the tournament. He remains quiet but when he talks he talks heavy and harshly. In the cartoons, Mario speaks with a characteristic Brooklyn accent, but his current incarnation \u2014 voiced by Charles Martinet \u2014 has a blatant Italian accent. Mario is also funny and comical, along with friendly, persistent, and always knows what he is doing. In addition, he enjoys Italian foods such as pasta, but does not like pizza as much.Physical Description  Mario appears as a short and stocky adult man in most of his appearances. Most of the time, he is wearing his trademark outfit: his red cap (with the M symbol), blue overalls with yellow buttons, red shirt, white gloves, and brown shoes. He has short brown hair, fair skin, and a thick dark-brown mustache. His hair has a two sideburns. Mario has three large bangs, all of which point upward, as well as a sprout-shaped cowlick. Mario's looks were a product of the limited graphics technology of the time: his arms would vanish with a shirt of a solid color, hair could not be properly drawn, detailed or animated; and the head could not host a proper mouth. As the developing team, headed by Shigeru Miyamoto, wanted a properly detailed character, so they gave him overalls, the mustache, the cap and a big nose, in order to make a recognizable sprite. Mario's looks have been mostly unchanged for much of the franchise's history, except for the first games: in Donkey Kong, he had red overalls and a blue shirt, and in Super Mario Bros his sprite had red overalls and a brown shirt, while the artwork retained the original red/blue outfit. It wasn't until Super Mario Bros. 2 that Mario got his current clothes. Unsurprisingly, due to the notoriety of the first Mario games, his appearances in merchandising and the Super Mario Bros. Super Show cartoon segment, his clothes had the Donkey Kong palette. In addition to his trademark clothes, Mario has used several other outfits depending on the activities. He has been seen with several sporting clothes (tennis, soccer, golf) and he wore lighter, more laid-back shirts in Super Mario Sunshine, in tune with the tropical vacation setting of the game. Although Mario's age is never really confirmed, Super Smash Bros. Melee says that Mario is 26 years old when reading the description of his trophy in the game.Powers & Abilities Powers Abilities Relationships with Other Characters Luigi  Luigi is Mario's younger twin brother. Luigi usually joins and accompanies Mario on his adventures, serving as the secondary protagonist (although Mario has been known to go on adventures by himself). Through the years, Mario and Luigi have maintained a brotherly love for each other as shown in games like Luigi's Mansion and the Mario & Luigi series. In addition, the two of them are normally paired together in sports titles and spin-offs and although Luigi has shown to be slightly jealous of Mario at times (as he admits in Paper Mario), he loves his brother very much and looks up to him as a positive role model. For his part, Mario seems to allow his sibling rivalry to get the best of him when competing directly with Luigi. When Luigi receives a trophy in Mario Power Tennis, Mario is shown slapping Luigi's back and stepping on Luigi's foot intentionally.Princess Peach  Princess Peach Toadstool is Mario's close companion since childhood. Mario saves Peach from Bowser. After his rescue usually she bakes him a cake or kiss him. Since Peach's debut appearance, the two have been largely speculated to be in a romantic relationship. It is mentioned that Peach is Mario's girlfriend according the official European Mario website. In Luigi's Mansion, she sends Toad to help Luigi search for his brother, and in Mario Party 5, Peach and Mario are called \"Cutest Couple\". They also share chemistry together in Mario Superstar Baseball and Mario Super Sluggers, as they are \"buddy players\". Mario Power Tennis even goes as far as showing Mario himself telling Peach of his love for her in Peach's victory scene. Peach responded with a smile and blew a kiss. Also, in Mario's victory scene in Mario Power Tennis, Peach gives him a small kiss on his cheek. They both show deep devotion to each other as depicted in many of the games, especially in the Paper Mario series. In the comic \"Warios Weihnachtsm\u00e4rchen\", published in the German Club Nintendo magazine, it is even revealed that they spent their graduation ball in school together, and that Peach decided in favor of Mario and against Wario. Mario and Peach are the Secret Staff Ghosts for Rainbow Road in Mario Kart: Double Dash!!. The official guide describes them at this: Aw, isn\u2019t that cute? Mario and Peach are together again, zipping down the Rainbow Road and leaving the player coughing up their dust. In the first Paper Mario, one of the Toads tells Mario to take Peach on a date to Shooting Star Summit. For the official guide of Yoshi's Island DS, in the description for the level Baby Mario and Baby Peach: Dynamic Duo, Nintendo mentioned that before the \"romantic entanglements\" in their adult lives, they teamed up as babies to stop evil. Also the official guide for Mario Party 8 stated that Peach is the apple of Mario's eye. Rosalina in Super Mario Galaxy even referred to Peach as Mario's 'Special One'.Rosalina  Rosalina befriended Mario in Super Mario Galaxy. She trusted him enough to help her restore the Comet Observatory, and in return she helped him to defeat Bowser.Toad  Toad is shown to be Mario's good friend. Toad usually helps Mario with supporting roles and gives him advice. In the Mario cartoons, Toad was shown to be a close friend of both Mario and Luigi's, as he would commonly be seen assisting them in stopping King Koopa's evil plots. Toad even helped in domestic situations, alongside Princess Peach. Throughout the issues of the Nintendo Comics System, the comics often portrayed Toad to being Mario's loyal and trusted sidekick. In Super Mario 64 and it's DS remake, Toad completely trusted Mario throughout his adventure. In the Super Mario Galaxy games, Toad often relied on Mario to back him and his brigade up in various situations during the adventure.Yoshi  Yoshi is Mario's best friend. They have gone on many adventures together, not to mention he saved and helped Mario when he was a baby. Mario occasionally rides Yoshi, although Yoshi has been known to be as good as Mario on his own two feet. Mario and Yoshi are often seen together trying to foil Bowser's plans. Yoshi can eat enemies too, which helps Mario a lot on his adventures.Wario  Wario is Mario's rival. Their relationship started out very violent with such acts as Wario stealing Mario's Castle in Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins, but their rivalry has settled down in later games. The two even teamed together in Super Mario 64 DS (though they did attack each other possibly for fun in the intro). Nintendo Power has stated that Wario is Mario's cousin, but this is unconfirmed. In the Super Mario Kun comics, the rivalry between the two characters is frequently a theme.Bowser  Bowser is Mario's nemesis and main enemy. Bowser and Mario have had a long history of antagonism and rivalry for Princess Peach. However, Mario almost always defeats Bowser one way or another. Bowser always tries to find a way to take Peach from Mario and have her all for himself. Bowser is jealous of Peach's friendship with Mario, as he admits in Super Paper Mario. Occasionally, Bowser is on the same side as Mario when they shared a common enemy, as shown in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars, Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga, Super Paper Mario and Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story. Oddly enough, Bowser has saved Mario from a few obstacles, as shown in the last cinema in Mario Super Sluggers; Bowser stops a Bullet Bill from taking out Mario. Of course, Bowser's only reason for saving Mario is so that he needs a rival and he wants to destroy Mario himself. Mario (along with Luigi and Yoshi) is also one of the three main heroes that Bowser absolutely hates, as they always get in the way of his plans.Sonic the Hedgehog  Sonic is the mascot of Nintendo's competitive company Sega and Mario's friendly rival. In Adventure Mode on the DS version of Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games, he joins with Sonic to save the snow spirits from Bowser and Dr. Eggman. Since they would both risk their own lives to save others with no hesitation, and are always hunting more adventure, it's safe to assume these similarities have made them good friends. Mario and Sonic have currently starred in 5 crossover games together: Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games, Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games, Mario & Sonic at the London 2012 Olympic Games, Super Smash Bros. Brawl, and Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U.Alternate Forms  Mario appears as many forms throughout the game franchise. He uses various items to unlock these forms. However, Mario can't unlock alternate forms in certain games such as Donkey Kong and Mario Bros. Certain items give Mario the ability to use \"one hit kills\" on his enemies. Some items aren't for offense, but for defensive moves. There are also items that are exclusive to just one game or game series; some of these items are the Bee Mushroom (Super Mario Galaxy series), the Propeller Mushroom (New Super Mario Bros. Wii + New Super Luigi U), and the Tanooki Suit (Super Mario Bros. 3 + Super Mario 3D Land). In the game Dr. Mario, Mario is in an alternate form (as Dr. Mario) throughout the entire game. He also makes an appearance as Dr. Mario in Super Smash Bros. Melee.Cameos Trivia References External links Bosses  Bosses in the Mario world.Enemies  There are many enemies in the Mario series. Some listed here are also playable characters in Mario games.Super Mario Galaxy 2  Super Mario Galaxy 2 is a video game released for the Wii and is the direct sequel to Super Mario Galaxy. The game was released in North America on May 23, 2010, May 27, 2010 in Japan, June 11 in Europe, and was released in Australia and the rest of Asia on July 2, 2010. The game sees Mario travelling to space once again to save Princess Peach from Bowser, who has stolen the Grand Stars to build his galactic empire.Gameplay  The most notable feature in Super Mario Galaxy 2 is Yoshi, whom Mario can ride on. Yoshi can gain new powers by grabbing special items, such as the Dash Pepper, which lets him run up steep slopes, the Blimp Fruit which causes him to float, and the Bulb Berry, which allows him to find hidden platforms. New items include a drill head, used to perforate planets. Also found are two new suits called Rock Mario and Cloud Mario; the former turns Mario into a rock ball that rolls around hitting enemies and the latter lets Mario make clouds to climb. There is also a switch that slows/stops time, a rotating item block similar to a die that Mario can use his spin attack on\u2014gaining whatever is rolled on the block, winged Question Blocks and more. Miyamoto stated that most of what didn't make it into Super Mario Galaxy would appear in Super Mario Galaxy 2. It is like Super Mario World and also has some Super Mario World themes. Star Bits, as well as suits such as the Bee Mushroom and other mechanics of Super Mario Galaxy reappeared in the game. However, the Comet Observatory has been eliminated as Mario's means of accessing the galaxies. The new method of traveling through the space is the Starship Mario, a planetoid in the shape of Mario's head which uses a map screen, with a word scheme similar to the ones in previous Mario games: Super Mario Bros. 3 and New Super Mario Bros. Bowser returns as a villain for this sequel. There are several other bosses including one that resembles a smaller version of Megaleg, a larger Major Burrows and a giant armadillo named Rollodillo. Luigi is also playable in the game, unlocked after Mario gets 20 Stars. Afterward, at certain points in time Mario will find him at the beginning of a galaxy. If Mario speaks to him, Luigi will offer to take Mario's place for the duration of the time spent in the galaxy. As in the original, Luigi runs faster, jumps higher and farther, and has less traction than his brother. When the player uses Luigi to gain any star in a galaxy, that galaxy will gain a Luigi ghost they can race against. After finishing the game, the player can switch between Mario and Luigi at will on the Starship Mario. If a player dies a certain amount of times on a single level, the Cosmic Spirit appears at a certain point in a level. When the player talks to her, she asks if Mario needs help. If the player agrees, the Cosmic Spirit turns into a small blue orb and circles Mario, then gains control of Mario's body. At any time you can press the plus button on the Wii Remote and choose to have her stop controlling Mario and you can regain control. If not, the Cosmic Spirit continues to beat the level. After she completes it\u2014or even if she does part of it\u2014you get a bronze star instead of a regular Power Star. It counts as a regular star and adds to your star count, but you can only get a Power Star by completing the level by yourself. The Cosmic Spirit is a similar guide found in New Super Mario Bros. Wii and Donkey Kong Country Returns (Super Kong). Due to high rankings, Super Mario Galaxy 2 is the second-highest rated game of all time behind The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.Development  Miyamoto noted that the game would be less focused on the plot. In an interview, he said the game would be more challenging than its predecessor. He stated that he hoped the game would be as successful as the original. Miyamoto also mentioned that some levels, maybe even several, may be repeated. Super Mario Galaxy 2 was initially named Super Mario Galaxy More, in fact, on the code, the name Super Mario Galaxy More is still there. This was because it was initially an expansion pack for Super Mario Galaxy, containing content cut from the original, before transforming into an original game.Story  Following off from the end of Super Mario Galaxy, Rosalina's end of game speech stating that, \"The cycle repeats itself, but never quite in the same way,\" starts becoming true. The game starts again with the Star Festival. Continuing on from the ending of the first Super Mario Galaxy, Princess Peach invites Mario to share some cake while watching the shooting stars. On his way to Peach's Castle, Mario finds a lost Baby Luma. The Luma seems to like Mario, and jumps into his hat. At Toad Town, Mario discovers Bowser attacking the castle. Bowser explains that he used the power of the Power Stars to become a giant, and kidnaps Peach and takes her away. Mario starts off at the Sky Station Galaxy, where Mario must fight Pewee Piranha. Afterwards, Mario lands on a strange planet that is inhabited by Lumas. Lubba, the captain, turns the planet into a faceship (Starship Mario) to assist Mario and Young Master Luma in their Quest for the Power Stars. After a long journey, Mario collects enough stars to reach Bowser's main fortress. Infiltrating Bowser's fortress, Mario defeats Bowser, collects the final Grand Star and rescues Peach. Suddenly, Rosalina and the Comet Observatory appear in front of the Starship Mario. Rosalina thanks Mario for protecting Luma, and Luma returns with Rosalina, taking Mario's hat as a souvenir. The Comet Observatory disappears while Mario and his companions return to the Mushroom Kingdom.Characters Protagonists Antagonists Enemies New Enemies Transformations  Some of Mario's power ups have returned from the first game, including some new ones. Yoshi also has power ups of his own. Super Mario Galaxy 2 includes all of the power-ups featured in Super Mario Galaxy except for Ice Mario and Flying Mario. However, the data for those suits was placed in the game, but never used. They can still be seen and used if the player hacks the game.Mario Yoshi Galaxies and Missions  (*) = Unlocked by feeding a Hungry Luma.Music  Much of the music in the game is reused or reorchestrated from past Mario titles. Examples of which are:Trivia Reception  Super Mario Galaxy 2 has received overwhelming universal acclaim, earning a metacritic average of 97.35%, and a GameRankings average of 97/100. IGN rewarded the game a 10/10, and an editor's choice award. They later took a vote and saw that Mario Galaxy 2 was by popular vote the best Wii game of 2010. 1UP.com awarded the game an A. Edge gave the game a 10/10. The Japanese magazine marked Mario Galaxy 2 with a 37/40 (9.25/10). Game Informer saw Super Mario Galaxy 2 worthy of a 9.25/10, with Game Pro and Game Spy awarding a similar score of 4.5/5 stars. GamesRadar and GameSpot gave the game 10/10. The Official Nintendo Magazine and GameTrailers both gave the game a 97/100 (9.7/10). The platforming, gimmicks, level design, graphics, and music have garnered undeniable acclaim, with many claiming Super Mario Galaxy 2 as a \"bolder\" take on the Galaxy formula.Bowser  King Bowser Koopa (\u5927\u9b54\u738b\u30af\u30c3\u30d1, Daima\u014d Kuppa \u201cGreat Demon King Koopa\u201d, in English also Lord Bowser, King Koopa commonly in other media) is the primary antagonist of the Mario series and is\u00a0the archenemy of Mario. Bowser most commonly kidnaps Princess Peach. He is the leader of the Koopa race. Although Bowser has joined forces with Mario in a few games, he has never ceased to kidnap Princess Peach and attempt to conquer the Mushroom Kingdom since his first appearance in Super Mario Bros.. As the central villain of one of the world\u2019s most popular video game franchises, Bowser is easily one of the most recognizable video game villains ever, though he has comic-relief roles in most of the RPGs. Though their origins are unknown, Bowser has eight children; the seven Koopalings and Bowser Jr.Characteristics  Bowser differs greatly from the rest of the Koopas, who appear mainly as bipedal tortoises. His iconic features include a large, spiked shell, horns, razor-sharp teeth, and a shock of red hair. In addition, while most Koopas appear to be herbivorous and prefer fruits and vegetables as their diet, Bowser, due to his sharp teeth, prefers meat, particularly from victims he hunts down and captures (with his carnivorous side confirmed in Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story), though he has, on occasion, consumed vegetation, as well. He is physically powerful, can breathe fire, and is said to have skills in black magic, as he teleports off the Bowser's Star Reactor battle place when beaten. Bowser's physical size tends to vary from game to game. In most games, he is very large, but there are exceptions. In Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars, he is barely bigger than Mario.Powers  Bowser has many powers from dark magic that include teleporting, causing\u00a0shockwaves to come out of his jumps, fire breath, charging, and transforming victims.Family  Bowser is shown to have eight children. Seven of them, the Koopalings, debuted in Super Mario Bros. 3. Later on, Super Mario Sunshine featured an eighth child: Bowser Jr.. Recently, for the first time in the series, both Bowser Jr. and the Koopalings appeared and teamed up together in New Super Mario Bros. Wii. Sometimes there are no Koopalings, so Bowser sends out False Bowsers. It is unsure who the Koopalings' mother is.Appearances  In Super Mario Bros., his first appearance, Bowser appears at the end of each of the eight worlds (Level X-4). These areas are \"dungeon stages\" and are characterized by white brick platforms, ample lava and spinning sticks of fire that can burn Mario/Luigi. Bowser waits at the end, on a bridge over a pool of lava. By grabbing the axe at the right end of the bridge, Mario/Luigi can cut the rope at the end, making the bridge collapse and sending Bowser into the pit of lava below. Alternatively, Bowser can also be defeated by repeatedly shooting him with fireballs. Due to graphic limitations, the in-game Bowser does not seem to have hair, although the official artwork for the game, as well as the remake in Super Mario All-Stars, depicted him with hair. Bowser throws hammers in Super Mario Bros., similar to the Hammer Bros., but this ability has largely been dropped; exceptions being throwing hammers with magic in Super Princess Peach, and he also threw hammers at the beginning of Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars, and uses them as his primary attack in Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga when he is teaming up with Popple, while Dry Bowser (his skeletal form) in New Super Mario Bros. and New Super Mario Bros. Wii throws bones in a similar manner. Though Bowser appears in the Japanese sequel to Super Mario Bros. (a title known outside Japan as Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels), he appears and behaves identically to his original incarnation. Only in Super Mario Bros. 3 did Bowser return with a new plot and a new look. For the first time in the games, players saw Bowser with a mane of red hair, a look that has remained with Bowser ever since. This time, Bowser only appears at the end of the final level: his castle at the end of World 8, where Mario and Luigi have to trick him into crashing through his floor in order to defeat him (although he could also be defeated with several fireballs or hammers.) This game also introduces Bowser's first seven children, the Koopalings. Despite the presence of offspring, no mate of Bowser has appeared in any story, and his only known relationship is his marriage to a reluctant Princess Peach in Super Paper Mario.Super Mario World  Bowser's next appearance in a standard 2-D platform adventure was Super Mario World. There, he once again appears as the final boss in the Valley of Bowser. Bowser's children, the Koopalings, again make an appearance. Here, Nintendo introduces something that would continue to be associated with Bowser through the rest of his video game appearances to date: Bowser riding the Koopa Clown Car. Fireballs now proved to be useless, and the player had to defeat him by stunning his Mechakoopas and tossing them back at Bowser.Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars  For the first time ever, in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars, Bowser becomes a full-fledged ally to Mario. After being thrown out of his castle (called a keep in this game) by the Smithy Gang (the antagonists of the game), he reluctantly joins Mario on his quest to recover the star pieces and repair the mystical Star Road, thus defeating Smithy and returning Bowser's castle to Bowser. Following traditional RPG class archetypes, Bowser fills the role of the power tank, with his only diminishing flaws being lowest turn speed and magic power.Super Mario 64 and Super Mario 64 DS  In Super Mario 64 and its remake, Super Mario 64 DS, Bowser invaded Princess Peach's Castle and stole the Power Stars. He used them to create worlds inside many of the paintings and walls of the castle. Peach and many of her Toads were also trapped in the paintings of the castle and could only be freed by Mario regaining all of the Power Stars. To ensure that Mario did not disrupt his plans again, Bowser sealed off the doors in the castle with the stars and even created doors that would only open with his keys. Unfortunately for Bowser, he did not lock one door, leading to his undoing as Mario was able to collect stars from the painting beyond that door, and then open other doors and systematically sweep through the castle towards Bowser. In these games, Bowser was battled three times: once in the Dark World, once in the Fire Sea and once in the Sky. Every single time, Mario defeats Bowser by grabbing his tail and throwing him into one of several bombs surrounding the battle arena. In the DS version, during the Fire Sea battle, Bowser also warps from one section of the platform to another, and pounds the platform to make it go off balance. In the third and final battle, Mario had to throw Bowser into a bomb three times before he was defeated. Bowser even managed to double Mario's load by breaking apart the vast platform they were on into the shape of a star, making tossing him a difficult venture. He also attacked Mario by chasing him. Bowser was able to escape, but Mario saved Princess Peach and restored peace to the castle with the power of the stars. In Super Mario 64, Bowser was solely defeated by the efforts of Mario. However, the remake Super Mario 64 DS differed in that the player was required to be both Yoshi and Mario to prove victorious. Luigi and Wario were available to be unlocked in Big Boo's Haunt and Chief Chilly Challenge respectively. But, keeping true to his rivalry with the red-clad plumber, Bowser would not accept any challengers but Mario himself for the final battle (although a glitch allowed him to be fought by anyone).Luigi's Mansion  In Luigi's Mansion, Madame Clairvoya tells Luigi that Bowser has been \"soundly defeated\" by Mario, and speculates that King Boo might have revived him, suggesting that Bowser was presumed destroyed following his latest clash with Mario. His demise is an unconfirmed event however (a red herring on Madame Clairvoya's part, no less), as the Bowser-like entity of Luigi's Mansion is never identified, and is merely piloted as a huge robotic mech by King Boo, who is the final boss and ultimate villain of the game. Interestingly enough, at the end of the game, the Bowser-like spirit is also trapped in the painting with King Boo.Super Mario Sunshine  In Super Mario Sunshine, Bowser's child, Bowser Jr., was introduced. Bowser told his son that Peach was his mother and that Mario kidnapped her. Bowser Jr. took on the disguise of Shadow Mario and vandalized Isle Delfino with Graffiti, framing Mario as a graffiti criminal. Mario, determined to prove his innocence, cleaned the mess with the aid of F.L.U.D.D. Bowser Jr. kidnapped Peach during this time and was pursued by Mario. Bowser Jr. revealed his true identity, but Mecha Bowser allowed Bowser Jr. to get away to Corona Mountain. Mario reached Bowser and his son at the end of the volcano in a floating, sun-shaped, slime-filled bathtub just above the peak of Corona Mountain. Bowser tried to kill Mario by breathing enormous gusts of flame and splashing slime at him, while Bowser Jr. assaulted him with Bullet Bills. Mario used F.L.U.D.D's Rocket Nozzle to produce a few massive Ground Pounds that tipped the bowl over, sending the Koopas to fall into a miniature island adjacent to Isle Delfino. Bowser confessed to his son that he had used him as a pawn, but Bowser Jr. then revealed to his father that he knew all along that Peach was not his mother, and that he was eager to challenge Mario again some time in the future, when he would be bigger, which filled Bowser with pride. They then decided to continue their vacation together.Super Princess Peach  In Super Princess Peach, Bowser, after hearing about a mysterious and powerful artifact hidden on Vibe Island, decides to search for said artifact, and he consequently also builds his summer villa there. Eventually, Bowser finds the artifact, the Vibe Scepter, which is capable of controlling and manipulating the emotions of others. Bowser proceeded to entrust a Goomba with the Vibe Scepter and then orders this Goomba to lead a brigade of Hammer Bros. to attack Princess Peach's Castle. Bowser's raiding party succeeds in capturing Mario, Luigi and several Toads. Unfortunately for Bowser, his Goomba minion proved incapable of handling the Vibe Scepter's power and ended-up casting a spell over Vibe Island, unleashing chaos throughout. After all of the Toads and Luigi are rescued, Princess Peach and her umbrella ally, Perry, can face Bowser whom, with the Vibe Scepter, can increase his power; regardless, Bowser is still defeated and Mario is freed by the princess.New Super Mario Bros.  In New Super Mario Bros., Bowser is the first boss. He is fought the same way as in the original Super Mario Bros. (except the axe is replaced with a generic switch which performs the same function), but this time, the lava he falls in disfigures him into a Dry Bones-like skeleton. The reanimated Bowser skeleton, named Dry Bowser or Skeleton Bowser, is later fought in the first World 8 castle, before Bowser Jr. resurrects his father in a potion-filled cauldron just in time for the game's final showdown. In this showdown, Bowser is a bit smarter, and will attempt to lunge at the player when the player gets behind him.Yoshi's Island DS  Bowser also appeared in the Nintendo DS game Yoshi's Island DS as the game's main antagonist. In this game, Bowser travels back in time in search of seven legendary stars that can apparently give him the power to rule the universe. The search for these stars lead Bowser to kidnap babies all across the planet thinking that the stars are located in the hearts of certain babies. Bowser appears as the game's final boss, right after his younger self.Paper Mario series Paper Mario  Bowser appears as the main antagonist of Paper Mario. He stole the Star Rod and captured the seven Star Spirits and gives them each to a certain character to keep watch over it. Bowser then lifts Princess Peach's Castle into the sky and defeats Mario with his enhanced strength. Bowser then knocks Mario off of the castle and orders Kammy Koopa to keep Peach locked up in her room. Throughout the game, Bowser is usually seen in scenes everytime Mario defeats one of his followers. It is even revealed that Bowser keeps a diary that he writes in. Once Mario saves the last Star Spirit, Bowser orders everyone to prepare for an attack as Mario first enters his castle. Once Mario has made it to the very same room Bowser has defeated him in, Bowser challenges Mario to a final duel. Bowser is soon defeated but has a different plan and takes Peach to a platform that resembles his Koopa Clown Car. Kammy Koopa then powers up Bowser where even the Star Beam cannot match the Star Rod. However, the wishes from Peach allow Mario to power up the Star Beam into the Peach Beam and Bowser is defeated by Mario. His power up platform soon explodes and sends him and Kammy Koopa falling out of space. Bowser is seen again during the parade where he is riding in his Koopa Clown Car. However, Jr. Troopa and Kammy Koopa are having a spell fight where they accidentally blast the Koopa Clown Car burning Bowser. Bowser then burns the two and the parade cuts to night.Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door  Although he is not the main antagonist, Bowser still plays a major role in Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door. This is Bowser's first time being a playable character in a Paper Mario game. Bowser is always played after one completes a Chapter and completes the Peach scene. During certain points in the game, Bowser will complete in a style similar to Super Mario Bros.. Bowser is also only fought twice in this game: in Glitzville and in the Palace of Shadow. During the fight in the Palace of Shadow, Bowser is fought alongside Kammy Koopa.  After the events of Chapter 1, Bowser is seen at his castle demanding to know where Kammy Koopa is. When Bowser reaches his throne, Kammy Koopa appears and informs Bowser that Princess Peach has been kidnapped. Bowser is furious that someone is doing his thing but settles down after hearing about the Crystal Stars. Bowser is determined to get the Crystal Stars and Peach after hearing Mario is after them as well and takes off in his Koopa Clown Car. After the events of Chapter 2, Bowser and Kammy Koopa arrive in Petalburg. The citizens run away at Bowser's presence and Bowser begins his search. Bowser believes he has found Peach but it is revealed to be just a poster. Kammy Koopa tries to confront Bowser but Bowser is depressed calling himself \"The Guy Who Talks To Posters.\" During the events of Chapter 3, Bowser invades the Glitz Pit and challenges Mario. However, he is quickly defeated. After the events of Chapter 3, Bowser and Kammy Koopa arrive at The Great Tree. Bowser tries to look for a Crystal Star but is having no success at the scared Punis. However, Bowser is caught off guard by the Puni Elder who tells him that Mario already has it. Kammy Koopa and the Puni Elder get into an arguement and the player has a choice for what Bowser can say. Afterwards, Bowser decides to leave to continue his search. After the events of Chapter 4, Bowser is at Rogueport and heard that there is a Crystal Star at Glitzville. Kammy Koopa suggests taking the blimp but Bowser says he has gotten into Glitzville before and takes off in his Koopa Clown Car. However, his ride breaks down in midair and Bowser is forced to go through an underwater level to get back onto shore. Bowser manages to make it back and ends up at the port of Rougeport. Kammy Koopa arrives and, judging her appearance, has had a great time at Glitzville. As Kammy Koopa continues saying how much fun she had, Bowser angrily burns her saying he swallowed a blooper while he was underwater. After the events of Chapter 5, Bowser and Kammy Koopa end up in Twilight Town. They notice Lord Crump walking around and Bowser wonders what he is looking for. Lord Crump eventually finds what he is looking for: the Super Bombomb that Vivian dropped earlier. Bowser asks what Lord Crump has found and Crump, not wanting to feel intimated by Bowser's appearance, orders up a horde of X-Nauts. Bowser and Kammy Koopa do the same by ordering up the Koopa Troop. Lord Crump is determined to take them down and throws the Super Bombomb at Bowser. However, it doesn't blow up and Bowser comments saying he'll show Crump some \"real fire power\". Bowser breathes fire at the Super Bombomb but it activates it and results in a massive explosion taking down both sides. After the events of Chapter 6, Bowser is still worn out after what happened at Twilight Town. However, his spirits are lifted after Kammy Koopa informs him that their troops found an underground passageway that may lead to a Crystal Star. Bowser must endure an underground level where he will end up in some sort of training room. Kammy Koopa then spots the Crystal Star on the wall on a belt and Bowser is about to take it. However, Rawk Hawk, the champion, enters and demands Bowser to get out. However, Bowser isn't intimated by Rawk Hawk even mocking him on his size. Furious, Rawk Hawk attempts to attack Bowser, but Bowser easily crushes him. The force from the slam causes the belt to fall off and the star to break much to the shock of Bowser and Kammy Koopa. Kammy Koopa confirms that Crystal Star was a fake and Rawk Hawk says that \"The Great Gonzales\" has it. Bowser is furious that another guy other than Mario is after the Crystal Stars as well. After the events of Chapter 7, Bowser and Kammy Koopa arrive at the luxrious Poshley Heights. Bowser comes across the\u00a0Poshley Sanctum\u00a0and manages to get the lock to come off it by simply yelling at it. Bowsre then enters the Sanctum and he and Kammy Koopa finally believe they claimed a Crystal Star. However,\u00a0Pennington\u00a0soon arrives but is\u00a0intimated by Bowser's appearance. Soon, Bowser drops the Crystal Star and, that too, is a fake. Pennigton then says that \"Luigi\" already has it and Bowser is even more upset that Mario's younger brother is after the Crystal Stars as well. During the events of Chapter 8, Bowser and Kammy Koopa enter the Palace of Shadow and work their way around. Eventually, Bowser falls through from a higher area and lands on top of the recently defeated Sir Grodus. Bowser comments his weight but soon spots the appearance of Mario and engages him in battle (with Kammy Koopa assisting). However, Bowser and Kammy Koopa are defeated and lie defeated on the ground. It is unknown what happened to Bowser after the defeat of the Shadow Queen but it can be assumed he went back to his castle. During the first battle, Bowser fights in a similar matter from the previous Paper Mario game. However, instead of a poison claw attack, he now uses a poison bite attack. He can also use the stomp attack that can take away an action command and breathe fire. During the second fight, Bowser is much more tougher as he has more HP and attack power, Kammy Koopa is assisting him in battle, and the battle is fought right after the Grodus fight. Bowser retains most of his moves from the Glitzville battle, but he now fights alongside Kammy Koopa who can heal and power up Bowser. During this fight, it is recommended to take down Kammy Koopa first especially since her HP is lower.Super Paper Mario  Bowser made an appearance in the Wii game Super Paper Mario. Princess Peach is forced to marry him by the mysterious Count Bleck and Nastasia. However, the union between them reveals the Chaos Heart, which would produce The Void that would threaten all of existence. He reluctantly joins up with Mario and Peach (as well as Luigi, who joins later on) to stop the evil Count Bleck and his minions. Following his high power role in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars, Bowser has exactly twice the attacking strength of his human allies and can decimate almost any enemy with his fire breath. His destructive strength is offset by his slow movement, clumsy jumping, the inability to climb ladders or vines and being a bigger target for enemy attacks.Paper Mario: Sticker Star  Bowser finally appears as the main antagonist of Paper Mario: Sticker Star since the original Paper Mario game. Bowser touches the Sticker Comet which causes it to split into six Royal Stickers which he keeps one for himself. Bowser is then only seen again in the very last level Bowser's Sky Castle where he fights Mario in many phases. He eventually turns big but Mario uses Kersti to power up and defeat him. Bowser is seen again trying to touch the Sticker Comet put Kersti stops him. Once Kersti remarks how she needs to change her career, Bowser shares a laugh with Mario and Peach. Unlike all the rest of the Paper Mario games, Bowser has no word of dialogue at all in this game.Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games  Bowser makes an appearance in the official game of the 2008 Beijing Olympics. He is classed as a 'Power' type and has a lot of Power and Stamina. He is very good at the Hammer Throw, but not so good at 100m.Super Mario Galaxy  \"Bowser is the great fire-breathing villain of the Mushroom Kingdom, a dastardly creature bent on capturing Princess Peach and taking control of the kingdom for his own nefarious means. He commands a vast army of Goombas, Koopas, and other nasties that do his bidding without question. Mario always manages to save Princess Peach from Bowser and stop his schemes, but the brute never learns. Perhaps if Mario finally corners Bowser in the heart of the cosmos, he can pound a little sense into the scoundrel.\"- (Super Mario Galaxy Description of Bowser) Prior to the events of Super Mario Galaxy, Bowser attacked Rosalina's observatory and stole all the Power Stars and the Seven Grand Stars that powered the observatory. Bowser used these incredible stars to bring his entire fleet to the cosmos and take over many galaxies, planning to construct a galaxy reactor powered by the Grand Stars that would make all the galaxies collapse upon themselves. This would give birth to a new cosmos in which he would use to rule and control the whole universe as a Galactic Empire that would last forever with Peach as Bowser's empress. He then kidnapped Peach during the events of the Star Festival, and held her at the center of the universe where he was overseeing the construction of his reactor. During this time, Bowser Jr. led most of the Koopa Troop to conquer several galaxies. Mario, helped by Rosalina, collected many Grand and Power Stars and destroyed much of the Koopa Troop, encountering and defeating Bowser twice in his attempt to rescue Peach. Regardless of these drawbacks, Bowser remained confident of his victory and the follow-through of his main goal to construct his own galaxy. Mario eventually battles Bowser at the almost-completed galaxy reactor. During the final battle, Bowser Jr. held Peach captive while Mario fought Bowser on multiple planets. Despite his efforts, Mario defeated Bowser and sent him into the magma of his own sun. The final Grand Star was released from the galaxy reactor, which exploded and formed a large black hole that began to suck up the cosmos. The Lumas used their powers to reverse the black hole, creating a new Big Bang and reforming the cosmos. Rosalina then appears to Mario in a vision, explaining to him that the nature and fabric of the universe is always unpredictable and always uses different patterns to sustain itself. Bowser tried to control this force for his own nefarious means, and for that he almost paid the ultimate price; he nearly sacrificed his own life. Mario, Peach, Bowser, and Bowser Jr. are then shown back at a restored Toad Town. Relieved to be alive, Bowser left to plan further schemes.Super Smash Bros.  Bowser is also a playable character in Super Smash Bros Melee and Super Smash Bros Brawl. In Brawl, he uses his final smash by turning into Giga Bowser. Giga Bowser is a form of Bowser that first appeared in Super Smash Bros. Melee as a boss at the end of adventure mode if the character going through this campaign completed it in around 20 or less minutes overall. Giga Bowser reappears in Super Smash Bros. Brawl as the final smash of Bowser. Like all final smashes, this final smash is temporary, but can still be deadly, especially on a smaller stage. In Adventure Mode, Bowser plays as one of the main antagonists along with Ganondorf. Bowser first attacks Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong and manages to turn Donkey Kong into a trophy. Bowser will continue to cause trouble until he is betrayed by Ganondorf. See Smash Wiki's pages on Bowser also: Bowser (SSBM) and Bowser (SSBB)New Super Mario Bros. Wii  Bowser appeared, and was again the final boss in New Super Mario Bros. Wii. Here, he appeared together with his eight minions, the Koopalings and his son, Bowser Jr.. In the last castle of World 8, Bowser was found in the last chamber, sending out fireballs toward Mario, similarly to his appearance in the original Super Mario Bros. When Mario began the battle, Bowser was fought in the same manner as in Super Mario Bros., as well as in the first castle in the original New Super Mario Bros. After Mario pressed the switch that caused the bridge to collapse beneath Bowser, sending him falling into a pit once again, a victory fanfare played and Mario rejoiced, believing to have won. However, upon inspecting Princess Peach up above, it turned out that it was, in fact, Kamek, disguised as Peach. Kamek then cast a spell over the chasm that Bowser had fallen down. As a rumbling noise began, Kamek paused to see if the spell had actually worked. To his surprise, Bowser appeared, now at a gigantic size, knocking Kamek off his broom, and proceeded to chase after Mario. Mario rushed through the area beyond the boss room, luring Bowser into launching fireballs at walls so that they were destroyed and he could proceed. After a long and grueling chase, Mario heard Peach's voice, and saw her in a cage up ahead, over a large switch. Jumping on the switch, Mario opened a humongous chasm, right underneath Bowser, that drained the lava from the room and took the Koopa King with it, defeating him for good. He was later seen being helped by his children, having survived the drop and returned to his normal size, but then crushed by his own Castle.Super Mario Galaxy 2  Bowser appears again in Super Mario Galaxy 2, once again as the primary antagonist. He invades the Mushroom Kingdom again, along with his son, Bowser Jr., but at a gigantic size, due to the power of the Power Stars that he stole. He kidnaps Princess Peach and flees into space again, claiming that he'll build a galactic empire to suit his new size, and put it in the center of the universe. Additionally, he attacked and destroyed Lubba's starship prior to the game, causing the Lumas to rebuild it in Mario's image when they team up with him. Using Starship Mario to pursue Bowser, Mario has to collect the Power Stars and save Princess Peach as he has done before. Bowser also orders a Magikoopa to get rid of Yoshi as he does not want Mario teaming up with his dinosaur friend. Mario faces Bowser three times in this game. The fights take place on a spherical planetoid, where Bowser, in his gigantic size, attempts to crush Mario with his fists, and by sending meteors crashing down upon him. When using his fists, Bowser's hand does get stuck in the planetoid briefly, and any meteors on the battlefield will rise and turn yellow. Mario has to ground pound on the meteors, so that they hit Bowser. He'll also use his fire breath to try and fry Mario. The final battle at Bowser's Galaxy Generator has two phases, with the second phase requiring Mario to send yellow meteors at Bowser before he gets close enough to punch him. During the ending, Bowser is shown to be tiny, which may likely be a side effect for using the Grand Stars to make himself huge.Mario & Luigi series Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga  Bowser appears as a major character and actually an ally (thought not exactly himself most times) in Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga. He is first seen trying to capture Peach but Mario soon stops and defeats him. However, Peach suddenly starts speaking in explosive letters that leaves even the Koopa King standing back. It was soon revealed that Peach's voice was stolen. Bowser, not wanting to capture an explosive letter, speaking Peach, unwillingly teams up with Mario and Luigi and flies the duo to the Beanbean Kingdom. However, Fawful soon shows up and destroys his Koopa Cruiser sending Bowser, Mario, Luigi, and the rest of the Koopa Clan down to Stardust Fields. Bowser finds himself stuck in a cannon and the leader of Stardust Fields, Tolstar, demands Beanbean coins for payment. Mario and Luigi done so but Tolstar lied about freeing Bowser and gets into a fight with Mario and Luigi. The Mario Bros. defeat Tolstar and Bowser still wants to be freed from the cannon. Suddenly, one of the Starshade Bros. shows up and lights the cannon with Bowser's last words to Mario and Luigi being for them to retrieve Peach's voice and is blasted from Stardust Fields. Bowser is seen again at the Chateau de Chucklehuck \u00a0where he is working for a thief named Popple under the name \"Rookie\". It is soon learned that Bowser has gotten amnesia from being blasted out of the cannon at Stardust Fields and now obeys the Shadow Thief. Bowser is defeated along with Popple and the duo make for Chucklehuck Woods where they go to find the Chuckhuck Reserve. They attempt to get the reserve but they are soon blasted away by Bubbles and his\u00a0Chuckolator. Bowser is seen again with Popple at the basement of Woohoo Hooniversity attempting to get the Beanstar. Mario and Luigi defeat them in another battle but soon, a Peach Bot lands beside the Beanstar and sings the tainted voice which causes the Beanstar to go on a rampage. Bowser, Popple, and the Mario Bros. all grab onto the Beanstar and crashes through the ceiling. Before they all fall off, Bowser regains his memory but soon falls down to Stardust Field badly damage. Soon, Fawful expels the spirit of Cackletta into Bowser and is soon transformed into Bowletta. Bowser stays this way until Mario and Luigi defeat Cackletta's Soul and Bowser is turned back to normal. Minutes later, Bowser wakes up wondering what happened but his castle is soon blown up and Bowser, literally, crashes at the screen. Bowser can be seen briefly during the end credits where he is dropped off at his crashed castle along with his troops.Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time  Bowser plays a somewhat a minor role in Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time. Bowser soon enters the time hole heading back to the past. Bowser is then seen again, this time, teaming up with his younger self attempting to defeat Mario, Luigi, Baby Mario, and Baby Luigi. However, Bowser and Prince Bowser are soon defeated and Bowser heads back to the present. Near the end of the game, Bowser is fed the mushroom of Princess Shroob and transforms into Shrowser. Bowser attempts to use this new power to defeat Mario's group but fails yet again and unwillingly aids in the defeat of Princess Shroob once and for all.Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story  Bowser now plays as (for the first time in the Mario franchise) the main character in Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story, with the Mario Bros. in a supporting, but still playable role. Bowser starts his day off with the usual attempt in kidnapping Princess Peach but fails as he is defeated by Mario. Peach and Starlow then use their powers to send Bowser flying away.Mario & Luigi: Dream Team  Bowser plays as the main antagonist of Mario & Luigi: Dream Team where he teamed up with Antasma for the thrill of power, but later betrays Antasma and reveals that he's just been using Antasma so he can take it all,\u00a0making\u00a0Bowser\u00a0the true main villain.Mario Party Games  Bowser appeared in all the Mario Party games as the villain. In Mario Party 2, Bowser got his own space. If a character lands on his space something bad happens. Sometimes he'll force the players to play one of his dreaded mini-games like Rain of Fire, Treasure Dome!, Fruits of Doom, and more.Mario Party 8  In Mario Party 8, Bowser attacked the winner of the Star Battle Arena tournament, stealing the Star Rod.

However Mario and friends see the mini stars disappering and set off to thwart Bowsers plans again. But Bowser has other ideas and sends Shy Guy and Kamek after them, and if that's not enough he uses some of the mini stars to create not 1 but 2 bosses per board. But when the player reaches the Bowser Station Bowser takes matters into his own hands and is the final boss which the player must defeat to complete\u00a0Bowser Station.Mario Party 10  In Mario Party 10, Bowser will be able to be playable in Bowser Party mode.Mario Kart series  Bowser appears in every Mario Kart game from the beginning (Super Mario Kart) all the way to the latest installment of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Bowser has always been a heavyweight character in each game, making him fast, but with slow acceleration. In Mario Kart: Double Dash!!, Bowser's Special Item is the Bowser Shell.Personality  Bowser is a villain of pure evil. Cruel and ruthless, Bowser is commonly portrayed as a power-hungry tyrant whose intentions are to rule the Mushroom Kingdom and the entire universe. His crimes range from kidnapping Princess Peach to acts of terrorism, giving him a reputation feared and dreaded by the entire Mushroom World. He also\u00a0does not doubt himself, and is always confident in his plans and\u00a0appears to enjoy\u00a0making fun of\u00a0his victims. One of Bowser's common traits is his insatiable lust for power and conquest. He thinks of everything in terms of power, and is always looking for ways to extend his dominion over the world. Several times, Bowser has shown to possess an arrogant sense of entitlement. Indeed, in Super Mario Galaxy, it shown that political power is not enough for Bowser. Bowser believes that only he is worthy to rule the universe and reshape it in his own image. Bowser lacks a sense of empathy and shows as little mercy to his followers as to his enemies. He has an extremely low tolerance for failures and disrespect. Super Mario Galaxy depicts Bowser as having genocidal tendencies, as his plan consisted in the destruction of entire galaxies for the creation of his new galactic empire. The games tend to portray different sides of Bowser. The platform games portray Bowser as a serious, relentless and legitimate villain, who will stop at no end to conquer the Mushroom Kingdom. At the same time, the RPGs depict him as a comic villain, reflecting the sympathetic aspects of his villainy as well as his clumsiness and ineptness. Despite his opposing personality, Bowser has rarely shown emotions other than anger or hatred. However, it should be noted that, despite Bowser's evil nature, he is actually in love with Princess Peach and has tried to win her heart on several occasions. Bowser does not know, however, that his constant attacks on the Mushroom Kingdom has made Peach hate him. In other words, he has shown that he has a soft side of him; that he cares for his children and sometimes helps Mario and Luigi in several games.Super Mario Media  In The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!, Bowser would often take on various aliases and costumes and try to scheme a dastardly plot of some sort, most commonly trying to conquer a kingdom or steal an ancient treasure and/or artifact; aiding Bowser in these plots were his Koopa Troop and also a sidekick of sorts, most commonly Mouser. Along with Mouser, many Super Mario Bros. 2 bosses like Fry Guy and Tryclyde appear as well. In several episodes, Bowser would capture Princess Toadstool and attempt to blackmail her into giving him the Mushroom Kingdom, although some other episodes implied he already had some measure of control over the kingdom.King Koopa's Alter Egos  In most episodes, King Koopa, as he's called in-show, takes on a various alter-ego throughout the episode. Oddly enough, though, he doesn't do it to mask his identity as when he usually meets Mario in the episode, Mario and his crew already realize it's the evil King.

His attacks are only physical and there are no Troopas in this episode. To try and beat him, Mario, Luigi, the Princess, and Toad caught Koopzilla in a giant steel net, only to be torn apart seconds later. Mario was able to stall Koopzilla by growing as big as him via the power of the Super Sushi. This thin amount of time gave Dr. Garden the opportunity to create the antidote, Super Sushi Shrinker.

However, their plans were thwarted by Mario]], Luigi, Princess Toadstool and Toad as per usual.Robo Koopa  Robo Koopa is an alter ego of King Koopa in the Super Mario Bros. Super Show! episode \"Robo Koopa\". The name 'Robo Koopa' is a parody of the 1987 movie, Robo Cop. Robo Koopa is a powerful robot version of King Koopa and is the last alter ego of King Koopa, as \"Robo Koopa\" is the last episode before The Adventures of Super Mario Bros 3. He is a white and blue robot suit with the combined strength of Koopa to make the ultimate fighting machine. The robot suit itself is equipped with many upgrades and attacks, such as launching Bullet Bills and gaining \"Super Toes\" which reveals the giant cannons in his feet. Of course, being a guy in a suit had to mean there was an ejector switch, which the Mario Bros., Bunsen, and Dr. Nerdnick tricked Koopa into pressing it and launching straight out of Robo Land's atmosphere.Relationships with Other Characters Mario  Bowser and Mario have a long detailed rivarly. As revealed in Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island and Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time, Bowser and Mario have been archenemies since they were infants. Bowser always wants to beat Mario and greatly dislikes him mainly for taking Princess Peach away from him. After years of being beaten by Mario, Bowser finally recieves some redemption in Paper Mario as he defeated Mario using the Star Rod. However, Mario soon defeated him once again and Bowser cries out on how many times Mario has defeated him. Bowser also seems to show jealously toward Mario. Though, on a few occasions such as in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars and Super Paper Mario, Bowser would team up with Mario to take down a bigger threat. Though Bowser is reluctant, Bowser does see that he cannot take over the world himself if another person is doing so and agrees to team up with his archenemy.Luigi  Unlike with Mario, Bowser doesn't really take Luigi seriously mainly due to Luigi being in his older brother's shadow most of the time. As seen in Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga, Bowser has a hard time calling Luigi by his real name and calls him by several nicknames such as \"Green 'Stache,\"\u00a0\"Greenie,\"\u00a0and \"Mr. Green Mario Brother Guy.\"\u00a0However, at the end of Mario & Luigi: Dream Team, Bowser finally calls Luigi by his name wanting revenge on both him and Mario.Princess Peach  The relationship between Bowser and Peach can be easily described as \"love/hate\". Bowser is madly in love with Princess Peach but she rejects him every time. This leads Bowser to\u00a0always kidnapping Peach which leads to the infamous running gag of the Mario series. Bowser, even though being evil, doesn't seem to harm Peach on occaisons and would even go out to his way to protect her. Bowser also doesn't tolerate other people kidnapping Princess Peach such as Sir Grodus and Antasma. Bowser even goes out to say that kidnapping Peach is his job.Wario and Waluigi  The relationship between Bowser and Wario and Waluigi is only shown in Mario Power Tennis and Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour. Bowser can get easily annoyed by the mischievous duo as in Toadstool Tour, Bowser chased them down after they accidently gave him a black eye with a golf ball. Bowser toss bombs down on them and eventually cornered them. However, a golf ball struck by Mario soon hit Wario and Waluigi in the eye and the golf ball hits the Bob-omb in Bowser's hand causing it to explode on them.Kammy Koopa  In the first two installments of the Paper Mario series, Kammy Koopa acts as the right-hand Koopa to Bowser. Kammy deeply respects (and fears) Bowser and tends to call him by various nicknames rather than by his real name. Bowser, however, tends not to show any recpect back to Kammy as he can get annoyed by her at times. In Paper Mario, Kammy always follows the orders of Bowser and their relationship is strictly business. However, in Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, their relationship is more comical as they try to search for Princess Peach and the Crystal Stars. Along the way, Bowser and Kammy Koopa run into various of hinderances. At one point, Bowser even fell into the sea and was forced to swim back to Rogueport. After hearing Kammy had a great time at Glitzville, Bowser burned Kammy. However, despite this, Bowser and Kammy get along well as a team and the two of them are always seen together (except when Bowser made it the first time into Glitzville).Elite Trio  The Elite Trio (Private Goomp, Sergeant Guy, and Corporal Paraplonk) serves as Bowser's main allies in the games Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story and Mario & Luigi: Dream Team. In\u00a0Bowser's Inside Story, the Elite Trio assisted Bowser in getting a giant Banzai Bill in order to take down Bowser's Castle after Fawful had taken over it. However, in the middle of the game, the Elite Trio push Bowser into a safe and lock him inside defecting to Fawful's side. However, Bowser (with the help of Mario and Luigi) defeated Fawful for good and Bowser allowed the Elite Trio to help in rebuilding his castle. In\u00a0Dream Team, the Elite Trio play a more serious role as they were used as a trap and faught Mario and Luigi in Dreamy Driftwood Shore. The battle was unique as Mario and Luigi needed to defeat all of the Elite Trio members at once or they will keep healing each other. Later, they also tried to slow down Mario and Luigi as they advanced higher into Neo Bowser Castle. Soon, Bowser was defeated for good and the Elite Trio retreated with their master.Antasma  At first, Bowser saw Antasma as an annoyance but soon decided to team up with him after the Bat King gave Bowser power. Bowser agreed to help Antasma get the Dream Stone that aided the both of them in the takeover of Pi'illo Island. However, near the end of the game, Bowser betrayed Antasma saying he was only using the Bat King to forward his own needs and takes the Dream Stone all for himself. This makes that Bowser only saw Antasma as a pawn to use in his own evil plans.Bowser Jr.  Bowser definately shows love for his only son Bowser Jr. The two of them are almost always seen together in games that involved the both of them. In Super Mario Sunshine, Bowser told Bowser Jr. a lie that Princess Peach was his mother and that Mario kidnapped her. This caused Bowser Jr. to overtake an alter ego to frame Mario and take back Peach for himself. However, at the end of the game, Bowser was forced to tell his son that Peach wasn't his mother but Bowser Jr. already knew. However, Bowser Jr. says he wants to fight Mario again when he is bigger much to the delight of Bowser. This is proven true as Bowser Jr. would assist Bowser in fighting Mario in later games such as New Super Mario Bros. and Super Mario Galaxy.Outside of Mario Media (Cameos) Wreck-It-Ralph  Bowser appears in the Disney Animated film Wreck-It-Ralph as a cameo along with other video game villains in a villains support group, Bad-Anon: One Game at a Time. They make a personal bad guy credo after the seminar is over.Powers and abilities Powers Abilities Trivia Koopalings  The Koopalings AKA The Koopa Kids are\u00a0seven minions\u00a0of Bowser\u00a0and the tertiary antagonists of the series, found in Super Mario Bros. 3, Super Mario World, Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga, Hotel Mario, Mario is Missing!, Yoshi's Safari, New Super Mario Bros.\u00a0New Super Mario Bros. U, Mario Kart 8, and Puzzle & Dragons: Super Mario Bros. Edition.\u00a0In addition to these appearances, they are also the main antagonists of New Super Mario Bros. 2.Birth Order  If there is something confusing about the Koopalings, it is their birth order. According to the Player's Guide for Super Mario Bros. 3, Larry is stated to be the youngest of the group, while Ludwig is said to be the oldest. As Larry is the first Koopaling of the game, while Ludwig is the last, it is strongly implied that all seven Koopalings are fought in order from youngest to oldest: Larry Koopa, Morton Koopa Jr, Wendy O. Koopa, Iggy Koopa, Roy Koopa, Lemmy Koopa, Ludwig von Koopa. However,the birth order for the five middle children has never been confirmed,. The release of New Super Mario Bros. Wii made even more confusion about their birth order. Morton is supposedly the second youngest Koopaling. However, he is very large in size and has a low-pitched voice, making him appear like one of the oldest Koopalings. As of now, however, the true birth order of the Koopalings (with the exception Larry and Ludwig who are the youngest and oldest respectively) remains to be seen.  In the Super Mario Bros. 3 and Super Mario World cartoons, an alternate birth order was used. Bully (Roy Koopa) is regarded as the eldest, while Hip and Hop (Lemmy and Iggy Koopa) are 6 year old twins, as well as the youngest. However, the cartoons are considered non-canonical.History Super Mario Bros. 3  The first appearance of the original seven Koopalings was in Super Mario Bros. 3; here, the Koopalings were ordered by Bowser to use their airships and armies to conquer the various lands of the Mushroom World. Each Koopaling, after attacking a kingdom, would steal the magic scepter of the land's ruler and transform that ruler into an animal of some kind. (Sometimes Yoshi, or Donkey Kong Jr. in remakes.) Mario would encounter and battle a Koopaling every time he ventured through a heavily guarded airship. The battle against the Koopaling would consist mostly of dodging the Koopalings leaps and magical blasts from their stolen scepter (or in Lemmy and Wendy case shoot magic balls and rings). It would only take three jumps on the head in order to defeat a Koopaling or use several fireballs. Once defeated, a Koopaling would retreat into their shell, fly to an unknown place (possibly Dark Land) and drop their scepter.Super Mario World  In Super Mario World the Koopalings aid Bowser in his attack on Dinosaur Land. Each Koopaling was charged with guarding a fortress on each of Dinosaur Land's areas. After traveling through a Koopaling fortress, Mario would battle a Koopaling, who would need to be bashed on the head repeatedly to be defeated. After a Koopaling was defeated, a captured Yoshi would be rescued and the path to a new area would be opened. For some reason, (maybe due to sprite limitations) the Koopalings' in-game sprites have alternate color schemes.Yoshi's Safari  In Yoshi's Safari, the Koopalings once again aid Bowser in the conquest of a kingdom, this time the target is Jewlery Land. In this game, the Koopalings attack Mario by using weaponry built by Iggy. It would take various shots from Mario's Super Scope to beat a Koopaling, thus forcing him/her to hold up \"the white flag of defeat\".Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga  After several years absence, the Koopalings made a return appearance in Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga. In this game, the Koopalings appear as bosses in Bowser's Castle, which had been hijacked by Bowletta and was currently attacking Beanbean Castle Town. In Bowser's Castle, Mario and Luigi would fight a Koopaling in their room, usually needing to complete some sort of challenge in order to battle them. They appeared in the same order as in Super Mario World (Iggy, Morton, Lemmy, Ludwig, Roy, Wendy and Larry), and none of them had any dialogue. Also, each Koopaling after Ludwig, Roy being the first used a Time Bomb in battle. If the Mario Bros. failed to defeat them in 9 turns, the Bomb's timer would reach zero and it would explode, causing Mario and Luigi to lose the battle.New Super Mario Bros. Wii  The Koopalings finally make their return in New Super Mario Bros. Wii, serving as bosses in the game's first seven worlds. They also make an appearance in the game's opening sequence, hiding in a cake that the Toads presented Princess Peach with on her birthday. Bowser Jr. also appears alongside the Koopalings, marking the first time that the Koopalings and Bowser Jr. have appeared in the same game. The seven Koopalings appear to all have Magic Scepters, while Bowser Jr. has a Koopa Clown Car of his own. In the first seven worlds, Mario and friends would have to ascend a tower in the middle of the world, the top of which the Koopaling of that world awaits. When defeated in battle, they are also seen jumping away after their defeat much like Bowser Jr. in the original New Super Mario Bros., setting up a rematch at the castle at the end of the world. Upon catching up with the Koopalings again, Kamek will appear and add a new element to the battle, such as replacing the floor of Larry's room with one that shifts up and down, or giving Lemmy an even larger ball than before.\u00a0 Additionally, Iggy is now taller and skinnier than before, and his hair is now green and changed in shape (these changes were most likely done to make it easier to tell him apart from Lemmy). Likewise, Lemmy has obtained a blonde ponytail, and Larry has lost 2 of his four fangs. Morton also appears to be much larger than he was before, as he is now even bigger than Roy (the size comparison between the two can be seen in the game's intro, where the Koopalings kidnap Peach). The shell colors of the Koopalings have also been changed. Larry's shell is now light blue instead of green, Ludwig's shell is now dark blue instead of green, Roy's shell is now purple instead of pink, Morton's shell is now black instead of gray, Lemmy's shell is now orange instead of green, and Iggy's shell is now a lighter shade of green to match his new hair color (and to contrast the color of Bowser Jr.'s shell). Wendy O. is the only one who appears to have the same shell color as before (pink) and has barely any changes. The Koopalings are given voices as well. At the end of the game,\u00a0Bowser and six of the Koopalings\u00a0were crushed by the castle. Larry and Bowser Jr.\u00a0were standing far away.New Super Mario Bros. 2  In New Super Mario Bros. 2, the Koopalings are the main villains of the game. This is the first New Super Mario Bros. title to not include Bowser Jr. They kidnap Peach with Bowser's Koopa Clown Car. Roy's battle is similar to his battle in Super Mario World, but he does not go upside down at all. He is the boss of World 1. Iggy's battle is similar to his battles in New Super Mario Bros. Wii, but the Chain Chomp does not grow large. Sand comes up when the Chain Chomp is about to appear. He is the boss of World 2. Larry's battle has platforms that move up and down. The magic moves around, like what Wendy does with it. He is the boss of World Mushroom. Wendy's battle is similar to\u00a0her battles in New Super Mario Bros. Wii.\u00a0She whistles and Cheep Cheeps appear. She does not use her wand in the battle. She is the boss of World 3. Morton's battle consists of Morton creating spiky balls with his wand. He comes out of a pipe, attempting to paralyze Mario. He is the boss of World 4. Lemmy's Battle is similar to his battles in New Super Mario Bros Wii, but\u00a0the icy platform has been replaced with a confabelt and his ball does not grow bigger. He is the boss of World Flower. Ludwig's battle consists of him hanging on chains. Mario must shoot up to where is and make him fall down. He is the boss of World 5. Unlike previous games which feature the Koopalings, it is not required to defeat all 7 of them to complete the game; only a minimum of 5 are required to be defeated due to the player being able to skip worlds using cannons.New Super Mario Bros. U  The Koopalings have their own airships in this title. Lemmy is the boss of Acorn Plains. His boss battle consists of Mario dodging bombs thrown by Lemmy and jumping on his head. His airship is circus-themed. Morton's battle requires Mario to dodge the large pokey's body parts and jump on his head. His airship, which is decorated like ancient ruins, is in Layer-Cake desert. Larry is the boss of Sparkling Waters, and his battle requires Mario to simply jump on columns made of water to reach Larry, and jump on his head. All he does to retaliate is shoot beams from his magic scepter, similiar to his other battles. Wendy's battle is ice-themed. She skates around the room and uses her ringed bracelets to make rings appear, which then cause icicles to drop from the ceiling. Mario must avoid these and jump on her head. She is the boss of Frosted Glacier. Iggy's battle takes place in Soda Jungle, and consists of him running in and out of pipes and summoning magmaarghs to hurt Mario. The player must wait for him to return to the floor and jump on his head to defeat him. Roy, who is the boss of Rock-Candy Mines, takes place above the airship rather than in it, similar to Ludwig's. He uses his Bullet-Bill Bazooka to shoot Bullet Bills at Mario. He must avoid them and jump on his head. Ludwig's battle takes place above his airship in Meringue Clouds. He levitates and creates identical copes if himself. Mario must identify which Ludwig is the real one by looking at the magic blasts from their scepters (the real Ludwig will shoot three blasts, whereas the fakes will shoot one) and jumping on his head. During the final battle against Bowser, the Koopalings appear following his defeat and use their magic to turn him giant. They are then knocked out of the air by Bowser. The final time the Koopalings are seen is during the credits, where they can be seen strewn about the Mushroom Kingdom following Bowser's defeat, as Mario takes Peach back to her castle and collects coins.Puzzle & Dragons: Super Mario Bros. Edition  Just like New Super Mario Bros. U, they have their own airships. Their airship is unlocked when you beat the world castle. Each Koopaling has their own element. Larry's (World 1) and Iggy's (World 5) element is Wood. Lemmy's (World 2) element is Dark. Morton's (World 3) and Ludwig's (World 7) element is Fire. Wendy's (World 4) element is Water. And Roy's (World 6) element is Fire. Probably the hardest Koopaling boss is Roy's (Although many people can't get past Morton) unless you have King Bill because Roy has a high defense, but high health too (Unlike Spinys, and Bob-ombs which have a high defense, but low health). King Bill can set Roy's defense to 0 and then Roy is then the easiest boss. In the final battle, Bowser and the Koopalings go into the Koopa Clown Car and Bowser Jr. goes into the Mini Koopa Clown Car. The enemies are called \"Bowser Jr.\" and Bowser and his Minions, not Koopalings. It is now questionable if the Koopalings are really Bowser's children. Unless if Bowser's children (The Koopalings) are his minions.Mario & Luigi: Paper Jam  In Mario & Luigi: Paper Jam, the Koopalings all appears as major antagonists along with the Bowsers (Bowser and Paper Bowser) and the Bowser Jrs. (Bowser Jr. and Paper Bowser Jr.).Mario Kart 8  The Koopalings are playable characters in Mario Kart 8\u00a0as revealed from February 2014's Nintendo Direct. This is their first appearance as playable characters in the series and they are unlockable. This is also their first appearance in the Mario Kart series overall.Super Smash Bros. 3DS/Wii U  The Koopalings are playable in this game but only as costume changes for Bowser Jr.. The Koopalings all possess Bowser Jr.'s moveset and only have different Koopa Clown Cars and voices.Non-Canonical Appearances Hotel Mario  The Koopalings appeared in the non-canonical Hotel Mario. This was the last appearance of the Koopalings for several years. Six of them got their own hotel, while Iggy was in Bowser's hotel. However, they were defeated in the end.Mario is Missing  In Mario is Missing!, the Koopalings travel with Bowser to aid him in his plan to melt Antarctica, thereby flooding the Earth. A Koopaling would guard the corridor of Bowser's fortress and battle Luigi, who was searching for his missing brother. All it would take was a few bops on the head to defeat a Koopaling in Mario is Missing!. In the Nintendo Entertainment System version of Mario is Missing!, only Ludwig, Roy, and Iggy Koopa appear; in the PC version of the game, Lemmy and Morton Koopa Jr. are the only ones not appearing, though they are mentioned in the game's manual.(Lemmy is said to play in the snow during the events of the game.) Also, in the PC version, instead of stomping the Koopalings, Luigi defeats them with a single blast from a Fire Flower that he gains after locking each door on a floor.Other Media  The Koopalings also appeared in The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3 and Super Mario World. Their cartoon names are Bully (Roy), Kootie Pie (Wendy), Kooky (Ludwig), Hip (Lemmy), Hop (Iggy), Big Mouth (Morton), and Cheatsy (Larry). This difference is due to the fact that the names of the Koopalings were not known when the show was being made.Luigi  Luigi (Japanese \u30eb\u30a4\u30fc\u30b8, Ru\u012bji) is the younger twin brother of Mario from the Mario series. He's the deuteragonist of some of the series' titles (Despite this, he is considered the deuteragonist by the overall franchise by some regardless). Making an appearance in almost every Mario game and starring in three games as the protagonist, over time, he has become a well known character. His role in games appears to be a deuteragonist to his older brother, Mario. He never seems to like going on adventures without Mario. In some games, usually in the Mario & Luigi series, Luigi is simply referred to by enemies as \"Mr. Green Hat\" or \"Green Stache\" and other generic names, making him out to be somewhat unnoticed by Bowser and his minions. For example, in the Super Mario Galaxy series, if Luigi shows up at the final battle with Bowser instead of Mario, Bowser will be surprised that Luigi has come instead of Mario, who he is used to fighting. Other than his color being green, he was planned to be exactly like Mario, but as his popularity grew, he developed a personality and style of his own. His jumping ability surpasses Mario's by far and he is normally depicted as cowardly and scrawny, but when he does get the courage to step up, he can be tough and overcome his fears. He and Daisy are in love. Luigi is also currently voiced by Charles Martinet.History Mario Bros.  After the Donkey Kong incident that the former carpenter Mario encountered alongside Pauline and Donkey Kong Junior. Mario began working a blue-collar job with his brother Luigi as plumbers in a sewage system, fighting off turtles, flies and even crabs. Once the Mario brothers defeated an enemy their payment would come out of the pipes that were clogged by the various enemies in the level.\u00a0Luigi first appeared in Mario Bros.\u00a0as a second player and was a recolor of Mario with no new actions, giving him no different characteristics to his brother Mario.Super Mario Bros.  During the events of Super Mario Bros. Bowser and his army, invaded the Mushroom Kingdom and planned on ruling it. With Bowser's Dark magic, he turned all of its inhabitants into grass, blocks, and various other objects, letting him take over the kingdom with ease, but once Bowser learned that Princess Peach can undo his spell, he kidnapped her and several other Toads. He placed the Toads in seven different castles heavily guarded by enemies and False Bowsers, and took the Princess, to his own castle guarded, by himself. When the Mario Brothers heard of this tale, they leaped into action to rescue the Princess, traversing seven different worlds and castles, rescuing Toads along the way, until they made it into the final castle, under the control of the real Bowser himself. Mario (or Luigi) would have to face Bowser and defeat him. Once defeated, Bowser would fall into the pit of lava below, and Mario (or Luigi) would have to release the princess from her cage giving one of them a kiss on the cheek. In Super Mario Bros. game play\u00a0he is the second player's character, with no differences between him and his brother Mario, he's still just a palette swap.Super Mario Bros. 2  Luigi got his first true playable appearance in Super Mario Bros. 2, where he accompanied Mario, Toad, and Princess Peach to the dreamland of Subcon, where he first showed off his excellent jumping abilities.Super Mario Bros. 3  In Super Mario Bros. 3, Luigi was once again a palette swap, but unlike Super Mario Bros. 2, his move set was identical to Mario's.Super Mario World  Luigi is again a palette swap and has no new moves until remakes.Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island  In Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island, Baby Luigi was kidnapped by Kamek and his Toadies, under the orders of Baby Bowser, probably as bait to catch baby Mario. Baby Mario and Yoshi had to rescue him from Bowser's clutches.Super Mario Galaxy  Luigi escapes Bowser's ambush on Peach's castle with the five toads that would become the Toad Brigade. However, Luigi is separated from the Toads and kidnapped in the Ghostly Galaxy until Mario rescues him. After that, Luigi continues to help find Power Stars, although he is in trouble where the stars are. After Mario gets three stars from him, an exhausted Luigi leaves the Power Star expedition to Mario. After Mario collects 120 stars and defeats Bowser, the player has to re obtain the 120 stars as Luigi, with slightly different handling than Mario including his ability to jump higher than Mario but a disadvantage of Luigi is that he stops slower when running.New Super Mario Bros.  Luigi is a playable character. When you go to the save file, press left, right and A at the same time. You will then play as Luigi.New Super Mario Bros. Wii  In New Super Mario Bros. Wii, Luigi can be played as by the second, third, or fourth player. He is also the Super Guide, in which after losing eight times, a green block will appear the ninth time you play that level, and if Mario hits it, Luigi will show Mario how to finish the level basically, as in he won't get all the star coins or show the player the secret places. When Luigi's doing the Super Guide, the scores, collected Coins, collected Star Coins, etc. will not be saved.Mario Strikers Series  He has appeared in both Super Mario Strikers and Mario Strikers Charged. His status was always balanced. Both his Super Strike and MegaStrike seem to have wind elements to them.Super Mario Galaxy 2  If the player collects twenty Power Stars, then Luigi will appear at the start of certain galaxies. If you talk to him, the player can play as Luigi. After you clear the level with him, a message will pop up saying a ghost has appeared in that galaxy. If the player goes back to that galaxy, then the player has the option to play as Luigi in the stage. At the end of the game, you can go back and play as Luigi at any time by going to a room with a green 'L' ('M' if you are Luigi) and entering. You will pop up again as the brother whose initial was on the room. (Note: When you go back to Starship Mario after completing the game the Mailtoad will have a letter from Luigi; if you are Luigi you will still receive the letter, but the Toad will mention that you are Luigi and ask why you sent a letter to yourself. This doesn't happen if you are Mario.) Luigi also runs significantly faster and jumps higher than Mario in this game. The downside is that he takes a second to stop running, (He slides for a second before actually stopping) and he doesn't swim well compared to Mario. When Mario swims,\u00a0it does not take any air to spin under water. Luigi uses a significant amount of air to spin under water.Super Mario 3D Land  Luigi appears after the end of World 8. An image floats to the screen, showing that Luigi has been kidnapped by Dry Bowser. After Mario gets past the first Special World, Luigi is accessible as a character by tapping the lower L button on the bottom screen.Super Mario 3D World  Luigi appears as a playable character. He can be played by any of the four players in any level. Like in the other games, Luigi can jump higher with his flutter kick. Additionally, to commemorate as part of the Year of Luigi, Luigi Bros., the new version of the original Mario Bros. from the NES in which the players can only play as Luigi, is unlocked after beating the game.Other Appearances Mario is Missing  This is the first game to star Luigi as the main character. In this NES, SNES, and PC title, Luigi broke into Bowser's Castle with Yoshi to save his missing brother Mario. It was an educational game that made the player learn about history. It has been surmised by some that this was an attempt by Nintendo to get younger kids involved in the Mario franchise, perhaps so Nintendo could make more money. In the NES and SNES, Luigi looks like Mario and is the same size as Mario. The gameplay in the SNES version is VERY different, where Luigi and Yoshi must travel to Bowser's castle. The visual appearance of his character in this game made him quickly become an Internet meme.Luigi's Mansion  Luigi got his first major role in Luigi's Mansion. In that game, Luigi had to save his brother, Mario, from a mysterious mansion filled with ghosts and Boos. Luigi also helped Professor E. Gadd in capturing a group of super evil, super powerful portrait ghosts, with the help of a vacuum cleaner, named the Poltergust 3000 by E. Gadd. Luigi defeated King Boo and a giant possessed Bowser and freed his older brother, Mario.Super Smash Bros. series  Luigi has appeared in all five Super Smash Bros. games, in the first game as a secret unlockable character, and in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U as a starter character. In Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Luigi got his own stage, Luigi's Mansion. His final smash is the Negative Zone, where he does a dance and creates an energy field that causes random havoc on any character caught in it and turns most everything into negative colors. In Super Smash Bros. and Super Smash Bros. Melee, Luigi's voice is only a sped up version of Mario's, while in Brawl and 3DS/Wii U, he has his own voice.Mario Kartseries  Luigi has been in every Mario Kart game. He has been middleweight. He has always been one of the speedy characters, like Mario. Luigi has had some tracks named after him, such as the Nintendo 64 Luigi Raceway, the GameCube Luigi Circuit, the Game Boy Advance Luigi Circuit, the Luigi's Mansion, and the Wii Luigi Circuit.Mario Kart: Double Dash!!  Luigi is one of the standard characters in Mario Kart: Double Dash!! He is known to be Mario's partner, put can partner up with anyone else in the game as well. Luigi is a Middleweight character, meaning that when a Heavyweight Character is with him, Luigi will be forced to be in a Heavyweight Kart. Luigi's Special Item is the same as Mario's Special Item, Fireballs. Although practically the same, the Fireballs are green, not red. Luigi's main kart is the unlockable kart: Green Fire which is similar to Mario's Red Fire. Not just this, but Luigi owns his own race called Luigi Circuit in this game.Mario Kart Wii  Luigi is a standard playable character; there is no need to unlock him.Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon  Luigi appears in Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon as the protagonist. He is using the Poltergust 5000 created by Professor E. Gadd to suck up more ghosts and battles his nemesis, King Boo once again to rescue Mario. The gameplay is similar to its predecessor Luigi's Mansion for the Nintendo GameCube.Paper Mario series  In Paper Mario, Luigi heads out with Mario after being invited to Princess Peach's Castle. Luigi stays in the main lobby while Mario looks for Princess Peach. However, the castle itself soon gets lifted into the sky and Luigi manages to escape. Later, Mario can visit Luigi at their house where Luigi usually does different things the each time Mario completes a Chapter. Luigi also keeps a diary hidden in the basement where Mario can only access after learning the Spin Jump. If Mario heads back to his house as soon he acquires the Super Boots from Boo's Mansion, he can actually catch Luigi writing in his diary who the latter flees at sight. At the end, Luigi leads the parade much like he did in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars. In Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, Luigi actually heads out on his own quest while Mario is on his. Luigi, like Mario, acquires many partners that help him on his journey. Luigi can be usually found in certain areas where he is eager to tell his story. However, all of his stories he tells are very long and usually puts Mario and his partners to sleep. During the final battle, Luigi's voice can be heard with the green text saying \"You go, bro!\". Luigi finally becomes a main and playable character in Super Paper Mario where he is one of the four heroes of the\u00a0Light Prognosticus. Luigi is first seen in the beginning with Mario who actually wishes something would happen. Luigi and Mario then head for Bowser's Castle where a new villain, Count Bleck emerges. Mario fails to defeat Count Bleck and the Master of Darkness takes Luigi and everyone else away from the castle (except for Mario). Luigi can be seen in Castle Bleck where he tries to find a way out. However, he is cornered by\u00a0Nastasia\u00a0who hypnotizes him into a new villain named Mr. L. As Mr. L, Luigi follows Count Bleck's orders and sets out to find the Pure Hearts before Mario. Mr. L succeeds in finding one in the Whoa Zone and fights Mario in battle.

Luigi is first seen to see Mario off as he heads toward the Beanbean Kingdom with Bowser. However, Bowser doesn't see any of his troops and instead notices Luigi jumping up and down waving his hands thinking he wants to join the Koopa Troop. Luigi tries to run away but Bowser's army starts to show up. Luigi tries to get away, but Bowser manages to catch him and put him aboard his Koopa Cruiser.

Attacks along with Mario. Luigi also has a unique move called the Thunderhand which he can shock enemies for damage. Outside of battle, the player can switch Mario and Luigi's positions by pressing the Start button. Luigi can use his Hammer on Mario to make him smaller (used for accessing secret areas where the entrance is normally too small) while Mario can hammer Luigi to send him into the ground (this move is mainly used to dig up Beans scattered throughout places). Luigi can also activate blue orbs using his Thunderhand ability to activate them. Luigi, at some points, must separate (or is separated) from Mario in order to solve some puzzles.Mario and Luigi: Partners in Time  Luigi returns in Mario and Luigi: Partners in Time. After Mario defeats the alien Shroob that came from the past, E. Gadd decides for the group to head into the past in order to rescue Princess Peach. However, as Luigi is leaning toward a Time Hole, Toadsworth comes rolling in and knocks Luigi into the Time Hole sending him into the past. Mario jumps in after them and the duo head toward a destroyed town. The Mario Bros. are defeated by Shroobs but their younger selfs, Baby Mario and Baby Luigi, save them. It is then the past and present Mario Bros. decide to team up and take down a new evil: Princess Shroob. In this game, Luigi's main attack actions are still \"B.\" However, whenever Luigi is with Baby Luigi, the two can both attack with the player first pressing \"Y\" for Baby Luigi's attack then pressing \"B\" for Luigi's attack.

After a rampaging Bowser sucks up everything in sight including Mario, Peach, and the Toad citizens, Luigi was found in the Trash Pit hanging up high. Mario frees him and the duo once again team up, this time, to stop Fawful. Luigi's battle style for inside of battle is still mainly the same except for different Bros. Attacks.

Outside of battle, Luigi often teams up with Mario in order to help out Bowser inside his body.Mario and Luigi: Dream Team  Luigi appears in\u00a0Mario & Luigi: Dream Team where he is actually the main focus character.\u00a0This game focuses mostly on Luigi as he and Mario fight inside of his dreams. During the beginning of the game, Luigi dreams about Mario fighting a strange shadow creature. Once Luigi awakens, he and Mario arrive at the Pi'illo Kingdom. Also in this game, Luigi has a dream version known as Dreamy Luigi. Unlike in the other Mario & Luigi games, Luigi is much more serious and rarely plays the comic relief role as he did before. In fact, in Luigi's dreams, there is a depth to his character that has never been seen before in any other game. The player can learn a great deal about his feelings when Dreamy Luigi speaks to Mario at certain points. In one particular instance, Dreamy Luigi points out that Luigi is actually happy just to be able to help his older brother out during his adventures.'Super Mario Maker  In Super Mario Maker, Luigi is a costume in the Super Mario Bros. theme, his flagpole theme is the music after he gets the key of the main boss in Luigi Mansion.The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!  Luigi was featured in The Super Mario Bros. Super Show! where he was voiced by the late Danny Wells and later Tony Rosato.Super Mario Bros. (film)  Luigi is featured as one of the protagonists in the Super Mario Bros film from 1993 where he is played by John Leguizamo.Personality  In many ways, Luigi is a foil to his brother Mario. Though Luigi is heroic and kind like his brother, he has a tendency to chicken out of some situations that seem to be too scary or beyond his capabilities; he may even cry if something were to upset him dearly. Luigi desires to be like his brother Mario and also become a hero of the Mushroom Kingdom. In the Mario and Luigi games, Luigi would usually try to back away from boss battles, leaving Mario to encourage him into helping him fight. But when he needs to, Luigi is as brave as Mario during events with strong enemies. He seems to be afraid of ghosts, and startled quite easily as seen in the Luigi's Mansion games. Charles Martinet has stated in various interviews that he invented Luigi's voice, and his current personality, on the spot, while doing \"Mario In Real Time\". Children would ask him where his \"brother Luigi\" is. At the time, his interpretation of Luigi had not been conceived, but he improvised Luigi calling out that he's in the kitchen, and that he doesn't want to come out because he's too shy, in what would go on to become his trademark \"timid\" sounding voice. This was in-keeping with how Luigi had been portrayed prior to this, as somewhat of a coward, and helped to cement this personality for the character.Appearance  Luigi resembles his older brother, but is noticeably thinner and taller. He wears a green shirt, dark-blue overalls, dark-brown shoes and white gloves. His hair is more of an auburn or dark maroon. In Super Mario World, his overalls are purple.Powers and Abilities Powers  Superhuman Strength: Luigi is able to lift and press objects that are several times his own weight, but not as much as Mario can. The exact upper limits of his strength is great. In Super Mario 64 DS, Luigi can lift King Bob-omb. Luigi showed an even more impressive feat of strength during the fight with Bowser. Luigi could lift him by the tail, spin him around and then throw him, but not as effectively as Mario. Luigi spins Bowser around faster and farther with more spins. Luigi's incredible strength also extends to his legs, allowing him to perform his signature move, the Jump Jump. Luigi is extremely good at jumping, and is capable of leaping two stories high. He is the best jumper in the Mushroom Kingdom, even better than Mario. Superhuman Durability: Luigi has a significant level of durability. He can withstand great impacts, such as falling from a height of several stories or being struck by an opponent with superhuman strength. Luigi can also endure extreme environments, such as volcanoes and tundras. Also, he can withstand fire, electricity, and ice. Superhuman Stamina: Luigi can maintain continuous physical activity for an indefinite period of time. Superhuman Speed: Luigi is capable of running up walls in Super Mario World, running across the surface of water in Super Mario 64 DS, and outpacing sound in Super Paper Mario. He is often displayed as being even faster than Mario. Pyrokinesis: Luigi has the ability to create and manipulate fire. This ability changes throughout the games he has appeared. In the platform games, such as Super Mario Bros., Luigi needs a Fire Flower to gain pyrokinesis. But in the RPGs and Super Smash Bros. series, Luigi already has this power. Luigi is quite skilled at using fire, like Mario is. Electrokinetic: Luigi has the power to mold lightning in his hand into a sphere, creating a powerful attack, called the Thunderhand, that can shock and damage enemies quite severely. Luigi only uses this move in Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga. Negative Energy: As shown in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Luigi's Final Smash is creating a field of Negative Energy while dancing to exotic music. Some of the effects of this Final Smash include putting opponents to sleep, dealing damage, and causing foes to move in slow motion.Abilities Trivia Princess Daisy  Princess Daisy is the ruler of Sarasaland.

The details of the dress include puffed sleeves with white, petal-shaped openings, a white, petal-shaped collar, orange panniers at her waist, and orange frills at the opening of her dress.

He debuted in Super Mario Sunshine. He acts as the main antagonist of both Super Mario Sunshine, and New Super Mario Bros., with his father only playing a minor role in each. He is a playable character in various multiplayer Mario games. Since his debut, he has stolen the spotlight as the main villain from his father in a few Mario games.History Super Mario series Super Mario Sunshine  Bowser Jr. debuted in Super Mario Sunshine. In it, Bowser Jr. uses a magic paintbrush, invented by Professor E. Gadd, and a special kerchief to transform into a translucent blue doppelg\u00e4nger of Mario, Shadow Mario, who vandalizes Isle Delfino, tricking the native people into believing that Mario himself is to blame. He does this to Mario because Bowser tells him that Princess Peach is his mother, and that Mario has kidnapped her. Bowser Jr. kidnaps her himself, and is eventually defeated along with Bowser. He realized that Princess Peach isn't his mother before Bowser decided to tell him, but he still refers to Peach as \"Mama\" sometimes in later games, such as when he challenges Princess Peach to a game in Mario Superstar Baseball. Bowser Jr.'s real mom is unknown.New Super Mario Bros.  He is once again the main antagonist and kidnaps Princess Peach. He drags Peach around through different worlds as Mario chases him. In this game, Bowser Jr. is the boss of every tower.\u00a0 His attack pattern depends on how he wears his bandanna. If it is hanging loose, Bowser Jr. will jump and charge at Mario and can be defeated by simple jump attacks. If he wears the bandana over his mouth, Bowser Jr. will\u00a0 throw Koopa shells at Mario and duck into his shell whenever Mario comes near, preventing jump attacks from working. Bowser Jr. also helps his father during the final battle of the game. At the end of the game, Bowser Jr. can be seen dragging his father to his castle.

Hit it again and a Magikoopa will appear. Hit it one more time and fireballs will start flying out from it. Three more hits and it explodes and Bowser Jr. gets away.  Bowser Jr. is fought for a second time in his small personal airship. In his third encounter, he summons a black King Kaliente to attack. He will first spit out three fireballs, followed by a coconut. The player must perform a spinning attack to whack it back at him, then the king will throw it back at Mario. If Mario whacks it at him three times with the coconut fly past him, he will knock the king's crown off. If it is missed, the attack pattern will repeat until Mario is successful. Bowser Jr. was not seen again until Mario reaches Bowser's Galaxy Reactor, where he is shown keeping Peach on his airship. While Mario marches up the steps to confront Bowser Jr., he fires cannonballs that collapse the steps. He then watches the final battle while keeping Peach.

When his fire hits the ground, it creates a large blaze there, the player must be careful not to land on these. The only possible way to attack him is to use the Propeller Block in order to spin up to his height and jump on him. He must be hit three times to be defeated. In the second battle, he uses his damaged Clown Car. Luckily, Mario finds a similar Car to use in combat. Mario's Car must be flown up by the player and used to knock Jr. into the electrical fence on the walls of the room. He must be hit three times either by the electric fence or on the head (or a combination) to be defeated.

Bowser Jr. can now fire more than one fireball in a row, and they create blazing obstacles on the floor. In addition, these fireballs can home in on Mario. He must to be transferred into a state of defeat. In the final scene of Peach, Mario, Luigi and Toads, a new scene opens with Larry down, tired.

With Kotabe's influence, Princess Peach changed considerably throughout her gaming history. Like most human characters in the Mario franchise, Peach has blue eyes. Her blonde hair (initially red or brown in NES games, resulting in the DiC cartoons depicting her as a redhead) reaches her waist in length, which usually sees her put it into a ponytail for most of her more active appearances. In terms of height, the only human characters to be taller than her are Pauline, Waluigi, and Rosalina (though Pauline may actually be slightly shorter due to the first damsel in distress wearing higher heels). Her primary outfit consists of a long pink dress with a ring at the bottom, pink panniers, short puffy sleeves, a raised collar, and a sapphire brooch set in gold. Accompanying it are a golden crown with four jewels on it, white evening gloves that reach past her elbows, and deep pink high heel pumps that usually go unseen unless one were to look at the correct angle or she does her primary victory pose in Mario Party 4-6, and, in Super Smash Bros. Melee and Super Smash Bros. Brawl a pair of pink bloomers. This look replaces her original dress, which was a darker pink from much closer to her waist; in the DiC cartoon Adventured of Super Mario Bros. 3 episode \"Mind Your Mummy Mommy, Mario\" she wore blue high heels as seen when running to a stolen mummy case. Due to her normal outfit consisting of a long dress and high heels, Peach has a number of alternate outfits for a variety of situations. Her primary two are a pink athletic minidress or a pink tank top and shorts (the latter based on Princess Daisy's primary sports wear); both are paired with white bobby socks and primarily-pink tennis shoes along with her usual jewelry and a blue hairtie keeping her hair in a ponytail. Other, more specifically-oriented outfits include a pink nurse outfit with matching sandals (Dr. Mario), a pink and white biker suit (Mario Kart Wii and both versions of Mario Kart 8, Daisy and Rosalina also receiving their own in their respective color schemes; for some strange reason Wario doesn't use his WarioWare-origin biker outfit himself under the same circumstances), a sleeveless, lighter pink version of her normal dress (Super Mario Sunshine, the sleevelessness along with a lack of her usual gloves being due to Isle Delfino's tropical setting), a pink leotard doubling as a one-piece swimsuit (summer editions of the Mario & Sonic series), a pink minidress with dark pink tights along with white gloves and ankle boots (winter editions of the Mario & Sonic series), and perhaps her most risque outfit, a pink midriff-baring crop top (with a white number 10 on both sides, small in front under her emblem and large on the back under her (also in white) name) and shorts (Super Mario Strikers, the sequel adding protective pink battle armor over it).History Super Mario Bros.  Super Mario Bros. is the first game that Princess Peach (then called Princess Toadstool) appears in. When Bowser kidnaps her and invades the Mushroom Kingdom, Mario arrives in hot pursuit of the Koopa King. She isn't playable in this game. Throughout the game, Mario is told she is in another castle than her previous one, but by the end of the game she is saved. At the ending she says thank you to Mario when he rescues her. She then tells him the quest is over and presents him with a new one with a higher degree of difficulty. In this game, she has\u00a0red hair instead of her usual blond.Super Mario Bros. 2  In the sequel to her first appearance, Princess Toadstool, along with Mario, Luigi, and Toad, were chosen by the Subcon species to save the Dream Land by the evil Wart\u00a0and his henchmen. This is the first time that Princess Toadstool is a playable character. Though Princess Toadstool seems to be the slowest and weakest amongst the four, her difference in gameplay is her ability to flutter in the air for a short period time, a little similar to the one performed by Yoshi, however Yoshi can go upwards for a few seconds whilst 'flutter jumping'. Ludwig von Koopa can also do this trick.Super Mario Bros. 3  In the sequel to her first playable appearance, Bowser attempts to take over the Mushroom Kingdom again. Instead Bowser (King Koopa) manages to kidnap the Kings and Guards of the Kingdom with the help of the Koopalings leaving the princess helpless. She then asks Mario and Luigi to save them. Near the end, Princess Toadstool ends up being kidnapped by Bowser again, leaving Mario and Luigi to save her too. At the end, everyone is saved and Toadstool played a little joke on the Mario Brothers by saying \"Thank you, but our princess is in another castle! ... Just kidding!\" referencing the Toads' often used quote in Super Mario Bros. as Nintendo knew it was a famous quote.Super Mario World  In this third sequel, she flies in a hot air balloon to Dinosaur Land for a vacation with Mario and Luigi. When they arrived, they found out Bowser was there too when he kidnaps Princess Toadstool again. The Mario's with their new friend Yoshi traveled through the different areas of Dinosaur Land battling Bowser's troops and Koopalings until they reached his castle and fought him on the roof. After hitting him with his Mechakoopas six times, Bowser drops Toadstool from his flying Koopa Clown Car and is sent spinning out of control into the distance.Super Mario 64  In Super Mario 64, Princess Toadstool (or Peach as she is called for the second time in the western world since Yoshi's Safari introduced it) invites Mario to her castle to eat some cake she had baked, but once Mario arrives, it is revealed that Princess Toadstool had been kidnapped by Bowser once again, and that many stars found inside of paintings (which can be jumped into, revealing episodes for a stage) must be restored in order to make progress in the game. In the end, Bowser gets the power of all the stars, and Mario must defeat Bowser in order to free Princess Toadstool. In the end, Peach gets saved and thanks Mario, inviting him to eat some of her cake. In the DS remake, the story is the same except with Wario, Yoshi, and Luigi.Super Mario Sunshine  In Super Mario Sunshine, Princess Peach, along with Mario and Toadsworth, take a vacation to Isle Delfino. In an advertisement video on the plane taking them to Isle Delfino, Princess Peach discovers a shadow that looks exactly like Mario, holding a paint brush. But Mario and Toadsworth aren't aware of the shadow, considering the fact they were too caught up in the great things they saw in the advertisement video. When arriving, a mysterious goo called Goop was found on the runway. Mario finds a talking, spraying robot called F.L.U.D.D. made by E. Gadd and uses it to spray away the Goop. Mario is then accused of making the mess in the first place (considering the fact that the real person who made the mess was an imposter of Mario) and is told he must clean up the mess. Later, Peach is kidnapped again by the imposter of Mario, named Shadow Mario. When Mario catches up with him, he must fight Mecha Bowser. After defeating it, Shadow Mario reveals his true form, being Bowser Jr., this game being his first to appear in. After explaining that the paint brush (which was the item being used to make this whole mess) was made by E. Gadd, and explaining that Bowser was once again behind this whole mess and had tricked Bowser Jr. into thinking Peach was his mother, Bowser Jr. takes Peach away, and Mario must go after her once again. Later, Mario finds Bowser Jr., still disguised as Shadow Mario, and defeats him. After this, a flood occurs at Delfino Plaza, making it possible for Mario to get into the volcano, called Corona Mountain. After finding Peach, Bowser, and Bowser Jr. in the volcano and defeating them, Mario gets Princess Peach back once again. This is the only time Princess Peach wears a dress with short sleeves. As a matter of fact, Princess Peach doesn't have any sleeves on her dress in this game. This is also the first time Princess Peach ever ties her hair up into a ponytail (which would be used in realistic situations where women in real life have their hair tied back such as in sporting and kart racing events) and the second time she has ever done her hair up with the first time being in All Night Nippon Super Mario Bros. where it was a Japanese cultural Shimada updo.Super Mario Galaxy  In Super Mario Galaxy, Princess Peach's castle has been brought up into space by King Bowser Koopa, who wants poor Princess Peach to rule the universe with King Bowser Koopa. She gets taken into Outer Space, along with many of the Toads, and Mario takes it upon himself to go progress through different galaxies to save her. Sometimes, she sends letters containing 1-up Mushrooms to the Comet Observatory.New Super Mario Bros. Wii  In New Super Mario Bros. Wii, like most of the other games, Princess Peach is kidnapped by King Bowser Koopa once again after his kids, hidden in a giant cake, take her away. Mario has to go through different Worlds in order to save her. When he saves her, she is found in a little cage. After this, the two fly away in a little hot air balloon. Originally, Princess Peach is planned to be a playable character in the game, but Nintendo apparently can't afford the extra programming of her dress, and decided to scrap the idea.Super Mario Galaxy 2  In Super Mario Galaxy 2, Princess Peach asks Mario to come eat cake with her while they watch the stars. But when Mario arrives at the castle, he sees King Bowser Koopa in a huge form holding Princess Peach, saying that maybe she would bake a huge cake for him, and wanting to create a huge empire that was more \"me-sized.\" After this, he takes her away, and Mario is left to chase after King Bowser Koopa and his son in order to get Princess Peach back, going through galaxies once again, and occasionally being sent 1-Up Mushrooms again.Super Mario 3D Land  In Super Mario 3D Land, Princess Peach is kidnapped after a destructive storm destroyed the Tanooki Tree, according to a postcard. Mario travels to the end of the first segment of World 8 to rescue her, where he finds that it is but a cardboard cutout. King Bowser Koopa shows that he indeed has the true Princess, so he grabs her and runs to the end of the second part of World 8, where Mario rescues her after beating King Bowser Koopa for a second time.Super Mario 3D World  Peach appears as a playable character in Super Mario 3D World. She retains her floating ability from Super Mario Bros. 2 in this game.

She teams up with TEC-XX, the base's main computer, to try to escape the base and find out their real intentions. TEC fell in love with her, which is the reason it teamed up with her. In the final battle, the Shadow Queen uses Princess Peach's body to fight. When the Crystal Stars give Mario the power to hurt the Shadow Queen, Princess Peach gives Mario the rest of her power to restore his power.Super Paper Mario  In Super Paper Mario, she is captured by Count Bleck along with Luigi, King Bowser Koopa, and most of Bowser's army. Count Bleck forces a marriage between King Bowser Koopa and Princess Peach to create the Chaos Heart. Peach is the first to be secretly released by Dimentio. She actually gets to join Mario in this game as the second of 4 heroes. Her abilities are using her parasol to fly, using it as a shield for infinite defense, and normal jumping. Her final battle is against Mimi, who insults her about always being rescued by Mario and Luigi. Peach gets mad and demands that the Mario Bros let her do this battle alone. When Mario is fighting Count Bleck and he is still invincible, she along with Luigi and Bowser show up and the Pure Hearts Start to work. She can be used to face the last two battles along with Bowser and Mario and is the best choice for people who want to 'play safe.'Paper Mario: Sticker Star  Peach, by far, plays her smallest role in the Paper Mario series in Paper Mario: Sticker Star. She is seen in the very beginning celebrating the annual Sticker Fest to honor the arrival of the Sticker Comet. However, things get tense after Bowser touches the Sticker Comet and it is split into six Royal Stickers. It is revealed a little later that she was once again captured by Bowser. Peach is then again seen in the very end after Mario defeats Bowser and she concludes Sticker Fest.

However, Queen Bean suspects that Bowletta will try and keep both the Beanstar and Peach to herself and Toadsworth gives Mario and Luigi one of Peach's dresses. Mario and Luigi soon gather the Beanstar Pieces and they head to Joke's End but Fawful doesn't fall for the Fake Beanstar and takes the real one for himself.

Mario and Luigi head back into the past and Princess Peach is actually seen in Gritzy Desert in the large stadium. Princess Shroob then drops Peach down where he is eaten by Petey Piranha.

However, once Mario, Luigi, Baby Mario, and Baby Luigi almost collected all of the pieces of the Cobalt Star, Peach worries telling them not to put it together. However, Baby Bowser puts the pieces together and it reforms into Elder Princess Shroob. Peach then tells a story on how she sealed the older and stronger Princess Shroob in the Cobalt Star and shattered the star to prevent her rein.

During the tour, Peach, Toadsworth, Mario and Luigi head down deeper into Pi'illo Castle where Peach is glad to explore more. However, she and Toadsworth are surrounded by strange beings and Mario and Luigi defeat them in battle.Other Media  Jeannie Elias and Tracey Moore both voiced Peach in the DiC cartoons where she has red hair, blue eyes, large forearms and no white gloves as opposed to her blonde hair, medium forearms and her white gloves.Origins  Princess Peach is portrayed as the princess of the Mushroom Kingdom. No larger reigning monarchy appears to exist. In Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars, the princess has a grandmother, and the Mushroom Kingdom government is ruled by a chancellor and the mushroom retainers. In Mario Superstar Baseball, Lakitu mistakenly calls Toadsworth her character likely due to a translation error. Like most characters from the Mario franchise, her backstory is purposefully left vague and undeveloped (nothing is known about her age, her height, and the royal family which she belongs to), though at the beginning of Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time, it has been revealed that she has been kidnapped repeatedly by King Bowser Koopa since childhood. A mushroom king has been a common character in the Nintendo Comics System stories, in which he has been portrayed as a forgetful person. Her mother and father are unknown but presumed alive. While the instruction manual for the original Super Mario Bros. indicates more about that he is related to Princess Peach, he has never appeared in any game and was never mentioned again. In Super Mario Bros. 3, it is revealed that the Mushroom Kingdom is part of a larger \"Mushroom World\" composed of seven neighboring countries, excluding the Mushroom Kingdom. Each of these are ruled by a different King, however, none of these monarchs seem to be related to her. Princess Peach lives in a beautiful palace surrounded by Toad guards, which also appears in kart and sports games. Eight of these guards are among the \"Elite\", including the most prominent of all, Toad. According to the American instruction booklet for Super Mario Bros., Princess Peach is the only one who could undo the evil magic that Bowser had cast upon the Mushroom Kingdom; Bowser kidnapped her for this reason. However, upon her rescue, this prophecy is not mentioned in the game itself, nor any other game, nor in the cartoons. Oddly enough, in The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!, Princess Peach (known as \"Princess Toadstool\" or simply \"Princess\" at the time) was depicted as constantly being in search of someone who could defeat Bowser's (known as \"Koopa\" at the time) forces, despite the fact that Mario and Luigi could do just that (and also the fact that most of the people they were looking for turned out to be of little to no help whatsoever). She looks a lot like Rosalina from Super Mario Galaxy. But, she was also the only one who could awaken both the Beanstar (due to voice being the purest) and the Dark Star.Trivia External Links Games  Games in the Mario series include the following.

Although in the Super Mario World Cartoon, Yoshi can speak just like a human, in most games, his only means of communication are incoherent babbles and noises.Abilities  In sports games such as Mario Superstar Baseball and Mario Tennis, Yoshi is known for his speed and his tongue capability. It's safe to assume that all Yoshi have the same abilities as the main Yoshi, as seen in Yoshi Island, where all Yoshi had the same abilities. In Super Mario Sunshine, Yoshi can not touch water. If he does, he will dissolve and return to his egg. However, in Super Mario Galaxy 2, Yoshi can not only touch water, but he can also swim. In some games, Yoshi can flutter jump to get to higher places.Yoshi Colors  While the main Yoshi is always the big green yoshi, otherwise known as the oldest of the yoshis, the species comes in many colors. They also come in black and white, although rarely. The eggs are usually white with spots like, green, blue, red, yellow, and many other colors, almost always the same color as the Yoshi that laid them. In games such as the Super Smash Bros. series, the colors of Yoshi are optional, but all Yoshi eggs are always white with green spots unlike yoshi's story where the spots and the egg box were all that yoshi's color. In that game, neither the orange nor purple yoshis were shown, except the opening.Game Appearances  Yoshi first appeared in the Super Mario World games in 1991 on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. In Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars, Yoshi had a rival in the form of a bad-tempered, sunglasses-wearing blue yoshi named Boshi. Yoshi also made an appearance in all of the Super Smash Brothers games. Yoshi made other appearances such as:Trivia External links Navigation  \u00a0Donkey Kong  Donkey Kong (also commonly referred to as DK)\u00a0is a major character in the Mario series. He is the first Mario antagonist who premiered alongside Mario (then called Jumpman) and Pauline (then called Lady in Donkey Kong on the arcade). Donkey Kong was an antagonist before Bowser existed. He later starred in the Mario series games which depicted him as a hero, though he remains a featured character in Mario spin-off games and in several Mario adventure and puzzle games, notably Mario vs. Donkey Kong, Yoshi's Island DS, and Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2: March of the Minis.Creation and conception  Neil's name came from the his creator Shigeru Miyamoto who believed \"donkey\" meant \"stupid\" in English and assumed the name would show the sense \"Stupid Ape\" to the American audience. Some say, that the Donkey Kong story may be based on King Kong, adding Mario as the hero. Donkey Kong's first appearance (un-chronologically) was in the Arcade game of the same name, where he was the main villain. In the game Donkey Kong made off with Mario's girlfriend Pauline, and carried her to the top of a high construction site. He was pursued by Mario, and attacked him by throwing Barrels and creating living Fireballs. He was eventually pursued to the top of the construction site, where Mario caused the bars supporting him to crash, sending him to the ground. However, this could be Cranky Kong going by the name of \"Donkey Kong.\" Donkey Kong tried to kidnap Pauline yet again in the Game Boy game Donkey Kong, this time accompanied by his son Donkey Kong Jr.. Donkey Kong's tactics in this game remained virtually the same, he attacked mainly by throwing a variety of objects at the hero. It is still speculated exactly why Donkey Kong tried to kidnap Pauline, while some sources say that he took her in revenge against Mario (who had abused him) others (perhaps trying to show Mario in a more favorable light) say that Donkey Kong fell in love with the damsel-in-distress.History Donkey Kong Jr.  Donkey Kong took the role of damsel-in-distress during Donkey Kong Jr.. In this game, Mario actually kidnapped Donkey Kong perhaps to keep him from from kidnapping Pauline and stood guard next to his cage with a whip. In the end, Donkey Kong Jr. arrived and defeated Mario to free Donkey Kong.Donkey Kong 3  In Donkey Kong 3 Donkey Kong was a main villain once again, although this time he did not fight Mario (who had gone on to star in his own series, and would not meet with Donkey Kong again until much later). In this game, Donkey Kong has gone on a rampage inside a greenhouse and a local exterminator called Stanley the Bugman was called in to defeat him (along with other bugs destroying plants in the greenhouse). Donkey Kong would use a system of ropes to lower himself to the greenhouse floor. When he reaches the floor, the game ends and Donkey Kong is able to destroy the rest of the greenhouse. After Stanley sprays Donkey Kong with insecticide three times to keep him off the greenhouse floor, he runs away.Post-Arcade, Pre-Rare  All the DK arcade games were ported to the NES. But Donkey Kong and DK Junior were thrown back into supporting roles for a long time, most notably, Super Mario Kart. However, in 1994, Nintendo released a Game Boy re-make of Donkey Kong, The only notable difference between the versions is Donkey Kong's now famous necktie he sports.Rareware era  The 1994 Super NES game Donkey Kong Country made by British game developer Rare marked a turning point for Donkey Kong by creating a new setting (Donkey Kong Island) and back-story for the character. In the Donkey Kong Country series, it is implied that the current Donkey Kong is the grandson of the original Donkey Kong from the arcade game, who has become a bitter, elderly ape named Cranky Kong. This Donkey Kong is portrayed as a powerful, yet lazy and laid-back ape who was more interested in lounging than heroics, and as such was constantly vilified by Cranky and his peers. The series introduced a sidekick for Donkey: his hyperactive friend, Diddy, and DK's crocodilian archenemy, King K. Rool. Despite his name being in the titles of both games, DK is not the protagonist in the sequel Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest nor Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!. Instead he is captured by K. Rool, while the player controls different Kongs who have set out to rescue him. The Donkey Kong Country series also inspired the Donkey Kong Land trilogy and a television series. Donkey Kong 64 for the Nintendo 64 would be the last platform game developed by Rare starring Donkey Kong. The modern Donkey Kong supplanted Junior's role in the Mario Kart series from Mario Kart 64. In addition, DK became a regular playable character in the Mario sports series and other spinoffs such as Mario Party and Super Smash Bros.Post-Rare era  Following Rare's departure from the series, Nintendo co-produced a trilogy of rhythm games with Namco for the Nintendo GameCube known as the Donkey Konga series, which were based on Namco's own Taiko: Drum Master, though only two of the series' games made it to America. DK Jungle Beat was released on March 14, 2005 in North America for the Gamecube. DKJB served as his main platforming adventure on the GCN and depicted DK as being more violent than his original image. It also used the bongos. In October 2007, Donkey Kong: Barrel Blast was released in North America for the Wii. However, the game was going to be on the GameCube. The game was panned by critics but was loved by fans of the original Donkey Kong Country trilogy due to its inclusion of characters, art, locations, and items from the trilogy. Many believe Barrel Blast to be the equivalent of the Donkey Kong Racing, a game that was planned but never came out due to restrictions of the Rare departure. Donkey Kong also has had a space in every console version of Mario Party since Mario Party 5, as well as being playable in some of the earlier games of the series. Meanwhile, on the handhelds, Donkey Kong was reunited with his former rival Mario in the 2004 Game Boy Advance game titled Mario vs. Donkey Kong. A throwback to the Donkey Kong title for the Game Boy, Donkey Kong resumed his antagonist role from his earlier games by taking over the Mario Toy Company, upset over the lack of Mini-Mario toys available for purchase. The game was followed by a 2006 sequel titled Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2: March of the Minis, where Donkey Kong, who is infatuated with Pauline, kidnaps her and takes her to the roof of the Super Mini-Mario World amusement park when she ignores a Mini-Donkey Kong toy in favor of a Mini-Mario. Aside from those, DK King of Swing on the GBA was released by Paon around the time of DKJB, and its sequel, Donkey Kong Jungle Climber for the DS, was released in America on the 10th of September. Jungle Climber took the gameplay of its predecessor, KoS, and mixed it with the style, locations, and items of the Donkey Kong Country trilogy.Other Appearances Super Smash Bros.  In 1999, he was one of the first to appear in the successful game and eventually the Super Smash Bros. series. He has been an obvious candidate to return to all games in the Smash Bros. series for almost 10 years. The stories of these games never really meant anything so therefore his involvement was nothing special but that was about to change.Super Smash Bros. Brawl  Donkey Kong returned to the Super Smash Bros. series in Super Smash Bros. Brawl with a new stage based on the look of Donkey Kong: Jungle Beat and Donkey Kong's Final Smash is Konga Beat which is based on the DK Bongos.[2] In the Subspace Emissary, the single-player adventure mode, Donkey Kong, along with Diddy, are chasing after the Koopas and Goombas that stole their bananas in an attempt to retrieve them. A surprisingly violent side of Donkey Kong is shown in the opening cutscene in a brief scene where DK pounds a Koopa Troopa into the ground(making it appear he crushes its shell). When they confront Bowser, the leader of the Koopas, Bowser attempts to turn Diddy into a trophy, but DK punches Diddy out of the way and takes the shot himself. DK is a playable character in most Mario Party games, until 7, in which he becomes in charge of DK spaces. In 7 these bring a DK related mini-game, but in Mario party 8 landing on a DK space gives an advantage (i.e. a chance for a free star). Donkey Kong also appears as one of the challengers Little Mac has to fight in the Nintendo Wii version of Punch-Out!!Mario Kart series  Donkey Kong has appeared in most of the Mario Kart games, all of which excluding Super Mario Kart, where Donkey Kong Jr. was a racer instead. He is a heavy weight in every installment as well.Vehicles Staff Ghost Tracks Mario Party series  Donkey Kong has played a major role in the Mario Party series. He has appeared as a playable character in the early Mario Party titles. However, with the debut of Mario Party 5, Donkey Kong became a supporting character. He usually hosted his own space on the boards that gave the characters extra coins and stars. However, in Mario Party 8, his role increased on the board maps.Mario Party 1-4  Donkey Kong was one of the original six playable characters to appear in Mario Party. In this game, he gets his own board map called DK's Jungle Adventure, which requires the characters to travel around the board map and collect stars by paying Toad twenty coins. Donkey Kong appeared with the original six characters again in Mario Party 2. In this game, his favorite item is the Bowser Bomb. If an item mini-game was initiated, the computer-controlled version of Donkey Kong would try to go for this item. Donkey Kong appears again in Mario Party 3 as a playable character and an opponent in Story Mode. He was often associated with the Strength Stamp (unless he was the one being used in the story, in which case Luigi was), and battled the player on the Pipesqueak board map. His beginning partner for Duel Mode is Whomp. Donkey Kong made his final appearance in Mario Party 4 as a playable character.Mario Party 5-7  Starting with Mario Party 5, Donkey Kong was removed from the playable character line-up, which caused some controversy among the fanbase. He then became a host of the DK Space on the boards in this game. At the start of the game before the players start their turns, one of the Star Spirits would reveal the location of the DK Space. When a character landed on this space, they would be able to collect coins or stars through different events. They also had a small chance of engaging in a DK Mini-game, where they would collect bananas and trade them in for coins. Before the DK Mini-game starts, a roulette wheel would be spun to determine the number of coins each banana was worth. DK would also appear to fend off Bowser when a player landed on a Bowser Space. When DK appears, Bowser would only take ten coins from the player. DK also appeared in Super Duel Mode as an unlockable playable character. In order to unlock him, the player must beat him in the hard difficulty of the tournament mode. In Mario Party 6, DK continued his role of hosting a space on the board maps. He once again gives out coins, stars, or starts a DK mini-game when a character lands on a space. During day time it is a DK space while when it's nighttime DK space is replaced by Bowser space. His bigger role in this game is in Castaway Bay, where he will give a star to the characters that meet him at the boat. He will switch positions with Bowser on this board map when a character visits him. His position can also be altered with the help of a happening space. DK reprises his role as a board space host again in Mario Party 7. This time, he appears with a whole new set of mini-games for the characters to play.Mario Party 8  Donkey Kong's role as a helping character increased in Mario Party 8. In this game, he hosted his own board map called DK's Treetop Temple. This board took place on top of a giant Donkey Kong statue and is full of barrels, vines, and Ukikis. The method of collecting stars on this board map is similar to collecting stars on other board maps in past Mario Party games, in which the characters must chase a star and pay twenty coins in order to gain it. The Donkey Kong space appears in this game again. However, it will change into a Bowser Space the moment another character steps on this space. When the DK Space is activated, Donkey Kong would usually perform an event that would benefit the players. The type of event that he performed differ from each board. After the event is complete, Donkey Kong will disappear until another character lands on the DK Space again. Donkey Kong also appears as a computer-controlled racer in Moped Mayhem.Board map appearances  The following list below describes Donkey Kong's appearance in each of the board maps that appear in Mario Party 8. The events that DK performs on this board was positive, in contrast with Bowser's evil antics.Mario Party DS  Donkey made a relatively minor appearance in Mario Party DS as a large statue in the board DK's Stone Statue. Prior to the events of the game, Donkey and Diddy Kong are invited to Bowser's feast, unaware that it was a trick. Donkey Kong was petrified into stone by Bowser and his minions. Diddy Kong pleaded for the shrunken heroes to revive him. They later accidentally step on the scepter that shrunk the heroes, returning them to normal size.Mario Super Star Baseball  Donkey Kong appears as a playable character in Mario Super Star Baseball. The intro shows him using his climbing ability to catch the ball until he realizes that he is above the chain chomp. It almost eats him alive as the ball on his glove goes flying. He later survives this, as he is shown playing for Wario's Team.Mario Series Appearances Mario Kart series Mario Golf series Mario Tennis series Other sports Mario Party series Others  Note: bolded games are playable appearance.Trivia Donkey Kong Controversy  The Donkey Kong Controversy is a controversy involving the background of Donkey Kong, Cranky Kong, Donkey Kong Jr. and Baby Donkey Kong. The controversy started with Donkey Kong Country in 1994 when the character Cranky Kong whom is said by Rare (the company that was developing the Donkey Kong series at the time) to be the star of the original Donkey Kong games and grandfather of the current Donkey Kong. This would also make Jr. his father. Years later during the release of Donkey Kong 64 Cranky Kong calls Donkey Kong his son which then created the connection making it seem that the current Donkey Kong is a grown up version of Donkey Kong Jr. and the original Donkey Kong is grown old into becoming Cranky Kong. This also explained Donkey Kong Junior's absence in games after Donkey Kong Country but contradicts the original idea. Donkey Kong Junior did make an appearance in Mario Tennis on the Nintendo 64 alongside the current Donkey Kong but this is likely not meant to be considered canon due to Mario appearing alongside Baby Mario in that game as well. When Yoshi's Island DS was released a few new baby versions of characters debuted in this title which one was Baby Donkey Kong. Baby Donkey Kong is likely to be the baby version of Donkey Kong instead of Cranky Kong due to him being younger than Mario and his strong resemblance to the current Donkey Kong. \u00a0Since Rareware originally created this fact and they are no longer in control of the Donkey Kong series it was unknown if Nintendo keeps this fact in consideration of what there view on the situation is. But since 2010 and the release of Donkey Kong Country Returns Nintendo and Retro Studios support the original idea of the current Donkey Kong being the son Donkey Kong Jr., the grandson of Cranky Kong, hence giving him the name Donkey Kong III.Powers and Abilities Mario Kart Wii  Mario Kart Wii (Japanese: \u30de\u30ea\u30aa\u30ab\u30fc\u30c8Wii Mariok\u0101to u~\u012b) (\u30de\u30ea\u30aa\u30ab\u30fc\u30c8Wii Mario K\u0101to W\u012b) often abbreviated to MKWii, is the sixth installment in the Mario Kart series.

Items are received through item boxes, which are sparkly and have a question mark on them are usually scattered in groups throughout a course, often in a horizontal line. The item is then stored for use whenever the racer wishes (except in the case of the Thunder Cloud, which is immediately activated). Items can be split into two categories, aggressive items, and strategic items. Normally, the lower the player's position in the race, the rarer and more useful items they will receive from item boxes to help balance the gameplay.Aggressive Items  Aggressive items are any items that will affect other players in a way that another racer's vision is blocked, stops, or loses speed, such as the red shell. The aggressive items are:Strategic Items  Strategic items are items such as the Mushroom, which will assist in the race, without affecting the other racers if without effort from the racer (e.g. The mushroom can only affect another racer if the other racer is rammed with the mushroom). Such items are:Link  Mario Kart Wii Wiki http://mariokartwii.wikia.com/wiki/Mario_Kart_Wii_WikiNew Super Mario Bros. Wii  New Super Mario Bros. Wii\u00a0is the second game in the New Super Mario Bros. series and a platforming game in the Mario series and the first Mario side-scrolling platform game for a home console since Super Mario World for the SNES and was released for the Wii. The spin jump and riding Yoshi are returning features from Super Mario World. It is the follow-up New Super Mario Bros. for the Nintendo DS. Four individual players can play together as Mario, Luigi, Yellow Toad, and Blue Toad.Plot  Mario and his friends are celebrating Princess Peach's birthday when a huge cake arrives. The Koopalings and Bowser Jr. pop out and throw the cake on top of Peach,\u00a0\"imprisoning\" her. They carry Peach to their Airship fortress, while Mario, Luigi, and two other Toads pursue. The other Toads from the castle use a cannon to blast the Propeller Suit and Penguin Suit for Mario and the others.  After defeating all the Koopalings, Kamek and Bowser Jr, the team gets to Bowser's castle. When they find Bowser, one of them jumps on a button and sends him falling down to the lava below. Mario, Luigi and the Toads see Princess Peach in the cage, but she turns out to be Kamek wearing Peach's dress. Kamek then flies out of the cage and casts a magical spell that makes Bowser come back ten times larger than his normal size, giving chase. The four-run away from Bowser until they get to a large button below Princess Peach. One of them pushes the button and the giant Bowser falls into the lava again. Peach is then released from her cage. Mario and Peach walk out of Bowser's castle and see Luigi, Blue Toad and Yellow Toad coming down in hot air balloons. Luigi walks out of his balloon and lets Mario and Peach in, but the balloon goes up without Luigi, so the Toads offer him a ride in their balloon. After the credits, Bowser Jr. and the Koopalings are all trying to push regular sized Bowser back up. They succeed, but by causing a huge thud, and Bowser's castle falls on all of them.Gameplay  The gameplay is primarily similar to that of the original New Super Mario Bros. for the Nintendo DS, with several key changes, including that of multiplayer gameplay.Multiplayer  Up to four players can play a level together. If players die in the game, they are suspended from gameplay until another player pops a bubble that their fellow character is suspended in. Players can pick up other players and throw them, a technique that can be implemented both cooperatively and competitively. If all the players are in a bubble at the same time, they will return to the map screen.Power-Ups  Three additional power-ups have been added to the Mario Bros. arsenal. The Ice Flower from Super Mario Galaxy allows characters to freeze enemies as does the new Penguin Suit. The Propeller Suit allows Mario and others to perform spinning jumps and fly. Yoshis have also been added into the game and serve generally the same purpose as they did in Super Mario World.Super Guide  A Super Guide, which allows players to skip sections of the game they can't beat, has been added to the game to make it easier. Activating the super guide will show a computer playing as Luigi how to beat the level with the option of trying again. Coins or points collected by Luigi will not count. The guide can be used only after the player has died eight times.Worlds and Levels Enemies Characters Playable Characters Non-playable Characters Items Cannons  In each world, a cannon is available somewhere on the map. The cannon's purpose is for the player to get in the cannon and let the cannon shoot the player to a different world. This makes it easier to get through the game but may make it harder for the player. For example, the cannon in World 1 shoots you to World 5. Both have a huge level difference, whereas World 1 is easy, and World 5 is more advanced. Because of this, it may be hard for the player to suddenly go from very easy courses to way more advanced courses. Also, because your character is shot to World 5, the Worlds in between are still locked and cannot be unlocked unless the player finishes Worlds 1, 2, 3, and 4. Cannons can be unlocked by finding a secret goal in certain courses that are close to the cannon. When finding the secret goal, the goal will have a black castle instead of a brown one. The flagpole will also have a red flag with Bowser instead of a black one and Mario will say something different from what he mostly says when he passes a normal goal (black with a white Bowser).Release  New Super Mario Bros. Wii was first released in Australia on 12 November 2009. The game was then released in North America on November 15, 2009, Europe on November 20, 2009, and in Japan on December 3, 2009.Reception Rosalina  Rosalina (\u30ed\u30bc\u30c3\u30bfRozetta, Rosetta) is a character that first appeared in Super Mario Galaxy, but has become a somewhat recurring character since then, especially in spin-off titles. She lives on the Comet Observatory\u00a0with her adopted children, the Lumas. She is seen as a type of sorceress, with great power. Her sole duty is to watch over and guard the universe, the Mushroom World\u00a0and protect her Lumas. Rosalina's back-story is described in her story book, which is found in the Comet Observatory's Library in Super Mario Galaxy. Nine chapters can be unlocked throughout the game, and the final one can be unlocked by completing the game. She is currently voiced by Laura Faye Smith.Appearance  Rosalina has a very similar appearance to Peach, other than resembling her. Like most other human Mario characters Rosalina has blue eyes, though hers are more cyan in color. Only her left eye is visible from a directly frontal view as her particularly large bang of her hair hides her right eye. She has peach-colored defined lips, and long platinum-blonde hair that reaches to her waist. Her primary outfit consists of a turquoise long-sleeved gown that bares her shoulders, along with a silver crown with four gems on it, a sliver star-shaped brooch, gold star-shaped earrings, and silver high heels. She notably appears in this outfit when playing golf. Like Peach and Daisy, she has a biker suit when riding bikes or ATVs in Mario Kart Wii and Mario Kart 8. Hers is primarily white and teal, to differentiate hers from those of Peach and Daisy. Her primary sports outfit is akin to the sporty minidresses of Peach and Daisy (though, again, teal), but with what appears to be white leggings instead of the other two girls' socks. Her swimwear (as seen in the fifth Mario and Sonic game) is based on those of Peach and Daisy (though teal again), but tweaked, along with sleeves to resemble her usual dress.History Super Mario series Super Mario Galaxy  While visiting the Mushroom World, the Comet Observatory is attacked by Bowser. While attacking, he steals all of the\u00a0observatory's Power Stars and Grand Stars. Rosalina appears later to Mario, or\u00a0Luigi, if\u00a0you've beaten the game once,\u00a0after Princess Peach is kidnapped. To help Mario or Luigi on their quest, she gives them a Luma, who is named Young Master Luma. He is a\u00a0Luma with Princess Peach\u00a0at the Star Festival. After Mario or Luigi collect enough Power Stars and Grand Stars, Rosalina flies the observatory to the center of the universe, where Mario or Luigi will have the final battle with Bowser.Super Mario Galaxy 2  Rosalina\u00a0makes her first appearance in the game in the ending cutscene of\u00a0Super Mario Galaxy 2. When Lubba then reveals that he has met Rosalina before, Lubba referring to her as \"The Lady of the Shooting Stars,\"\u00a0but\u00a0that is all that is shared. During the game, Rosalina will send letters to the Luma that is with Mario, but knows that she doesn't sign the letters, so the identity of the writer is unknown.  If\u00a0the player\u00a0receives\u00a0120 Stars and\u00a0defeats the final boss again, a cutscene is played.\u00a0The cutscene shows\u00a0Rosalina and her Lumas in the Library, revealing that she was telling the story of Super Mario Galaxy 2. Then, she decides to narrate how Mario,\u00a0or Luigi,\u00a0if you complete the game once,\u00a0collect every Green Star to her Lumas. If Mario and Luigi collect every single star in the game, and\u00a0beat the Grandmaster Galaxy Daredevil Comet run, Rosalina will thank and join\u00a0them on the Starship Mario. Lubba then\u00a0congratulates you\u00a0on bringing Rosalina, or \"The Lady of the Shooting Stars\" aboard the ship. Players can also use Rosalina to represent their file on the file select screen. However, the Rosalina avatar can only be used on save files in which the player has collected 120 stars, and unlocked the Green Star Prankster Comets. This game also features a cosmic entity that highly resembles Rosalina, known as the Cosmic Spirit. This entity will appear after failing to collect a star on a level several times, and she will be there to help you.Super Mario 3D World  Rosalina is unlockable as the fifth playable character in Super Mario 3D World.\u00a0She\u00a0is unlocked by playing and completing the second level in World Star, Super Galaxy. This has marked the first time Rosalina is playable in a Mario platformer game. After defeating Bowser in World 8, the Sprixies can be found in World 1. After talking to them, the Sprixies will build a rocket that will go to World Star. She will appear in the second level of the world, and after completing it she will become playable in any level. Her special abilities, as a playable character, are the Spin Jump and the Spin Attack, originally from the Super Mario Galaxy series.Super Mario Odyssey  Rosalina makes a appearnces in Odyssey as an 8-bit sprite in the Dark Side of the moon and on a wall on the Darker Side of the moon, however she was originally supposedly to make actually appears in the game as a guitarist and Mario was originally supposedly to have a Luma costume.Other Exciting Appearances Mario Kart series Mario Kart Wii  Rosalina makes her first playable appearance in Mario Kart Wii as an unlockable character. She can be unlocked by having a save file for Super Mario Galaxy and racing in 50 races, or the player can attain at least a 1 Star Rank for all Mirror Grand Prix Cups. Unlike Princess Peach and Princess Daisy, Rosalina\u00a0is in the heavyweight\u00a0class (likely as she is taller than the others; the same thing happens to Waluigi)\u00a0while Peach and Daisy are in the middleweight\u00a0class.\u00a0While she races, a\u00a0yellow Luma will circle around her the whole time, and even make sounds as well.\u00a0Rosalina will wear her normal dress when riding in karts,\u00a0but on bikes she wears her biker suit, which is the same as Peach's and Daisy's, but has Rosalina's own color scheme.\u00a0Her emblem on her kart and bike is the Grand Star. Rosalina is also\u00a0the staff ghost character for Rainbow Road.Mario Kart 7  Rosalina returns again in the Mario Kart series, this being her second time in the series overall. This time, Rosalina doesn't have a Luma circling her kart, but her emblem remains the Grand Star. She is again a heavier character, but this time being in the cruiser class. Just like the previous Mario Kart game, she is unlockable by completing the Star Cup on 150cc. Rosalina has a course named after her, which is called Rosalina's Ice World, which has what appears to be the Comet Observatory in the background. The staff ghosts uses her in the Time Trials for Music Park and Rosalina's Ice World.Mario Kart 8  Like the previous Mario Kart games, Rosalina is an unlockable and playable character. Unlike Mario Kart Wii, Luma will not be circling around her. Like Mario Kart Wii, Rosalina maintains her biker suit, which she wears on bikes and the game's new ATVs.Mario Kart 8 Deluxe  Her appearance in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is unchanged from her appearance in Mario Kart 8. She is used by the same 150cc staff ghost, Nin\u2605Leonel on a Circuit Special with the Standard tires and Super Glider. Even used by the 200cc staff ghost, Nin\u2605Pedro.Super Smash Bros. action series Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U  Rosalina is\u00a0a newcomer in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U\u00a0with Luma as her partner. She is the fifth\u00a0Mario\u00a0universe representative and the second female representative after Peach. In battle, Luma mimics the actions of Rosalina, allowing the duo to attack from two places at once. Rosalina's Special Moves and standard move set are all based on\u00a0Super Mario Galaxy: Rosalina's Final Smash Power Star involves her summoning a massive Power Star, which gradually expands while shooting out smaller stars, before exploding, racking up massive amounts of damage for opponents caught within it. Much like Peach, her defense and speed equipment attributes are based on her normal outfit (here her dress has glittery stars on it and her heels are more of an extremely light green instead of the usual silver).Mario Party series Mario Party: Island Tour  Rosalina appears in Mario Party: Island Tour, however she is not playable. She appears on the Rocket Road game board at the end.Mario Party 10  Rosalina makes her Mario Party debut in Mario Party 10 as a standard playable character.Powers and Abilities Trivia Super Mario Galaxy  Super Mario Galaxy is a video game released for the Wii. It is an entry to the series of Mario's 3D platformers, after the games Super Mario 64, Super Mario Sunshine, and Super Mario 64 DS. It had 700,000 copies pre-ordered in Japan, and 400,000 in the U.S. Super Mario Galaxy, unlike other Mario games, takes place in deep space. Most of the game's levels consist of many small planets and planetoids, however some are as big as real life planets. The game has 121 Stars to collect, although the player will have to go through the first 120 Stars twice (once as Mario and once as Luigi) to unlock the 121st and final Star.Story  Every hundred years a huge comet (Grand Star) flies by in the skies above the Mushroom Kingdom. One year, that comet filled the entire sky, and from it fell a stream of shooting stars. The Toads scooped up the Star Bits and brought them to the castle, where they were reborn as a great Power Star. That night Mario received a letter... \"Dear Mario, I'll be waiting for you at the castle on the night of the Star Festival. There's something I'd like to give you.\" From Peach. With invitation in hand, Mario headed off to the castle just as the Star Festival was getting into full swing. Surrounded by Toads gleefully trying to catch falling Star Bits, Mario was looking forward to the night's festivities. But then something happened... Bowser attacked the Toads with his airships and froze them in crystals. He \"invited\" Peach to the creation of his new galaxy and warped into space with her castle to the center of the universe. When Mario tried to save her, a Magikoopa broke the airborne path to the castle causing Mario to fall into an unknown land. Mario later woke up on a small grassy moon and met three Star Bunnies who promised to tell Mario where he was if he caught them. When he did, they took him to meet Princess Rosalina, who told Mario that the universe was in great peril after Bowser had attacked her \"ship\", the Comet Observatory, and stole the Power Stars, including the seven Grand Stars. Without them, the Comet Observatory was doomed. Rosalina asked Mario to rescue the Grand Stars in order to defeat Bowser, who took Peach to the center of the universe. Mario then started his journey across the galaxies, freeing Power and Grand Stars. Once five of the Grand Stars were collected, the Comet Observatory became a starship and was able to take Mario to the center of the universe. There he defeated Bowser in his brand-new galaxy, retrieved the last Grand Star, and rescued Princess Peach. Without this Grand Star, the sun of Bowser's near-complete galaxy went supernova and became a gigantic black hole. Everything in the universe began to fall into the black hole. The Lumas from the Comet Observatory, including the Luma who had faithfully accompanied Mario, sacrificed themselves in order to neutralize it. The Lumas attacked the black hole's singularity, and it soon disintegrated in a massive explosion. Mario appeared in front of Rosalina, who had somehow managed to save him from the cataclysm. She told him that \"this was not the end, but a new beginning for the universe,\" and that \"the universe was an endless cycle, but one that never repeats itself exactly the same way each time.\" Mario later awoke in the Mushroom Kingdom near Peach's castle. He saw everyone he'd met throughout his adventure celebrating, while Bowser and Peach sat next to him. When he looked into the sky, he noticed a green light of a new galaxy. \"Welcome! Welcome, new galaxy!\" Mario exclaimed, as the camera zoomed out into space, revealing that the whole universe had been merged into one giant galaxy (although the galaxy Mario saw in the sky is not shown). If the player continues with the file, Rosalina will say if all 120 Power Stars are collected, the player can travel the new world. If the player has finished the game with 120 stars, after the credits Rosalina and a group of Lumas appear on the planet Mario started on at the beginning of the game. Rosalina says \"I will watch over you from beyond the stars,\" and flies off to the Comet Observatory. Then the white baby Luma is shown to be alive, now residing on the small planet. Finally, if the player has just beaten the game with 120 Stars with Mario, a Luigi tab will appear with him saying \"Super Luigi Galaxy!\". The Luigi Story goes exactly the same as Mario's. Even the Luigi in Mario's story is still Luigi. When the player has defeated Bowser and continues with the Luigi Story, Rosalina will again say if Luigi collects all 120 stars, the player can travel to a new world. When the player collects 120 Stars, the player can travel to Grand Finale Galaxy, the new world and the same new galaxy Mario saw in the ending movie. This galaxy is parallel to the Mushroom World. This explains why there are two Luigis. The 121st, and final, Star can be found here.Luigi Comparisons  In Super Mario Galaxy, also in its sequel Super Mario Galaxy 2, Luigi is a playable character (see Luigi Story above). Comparing Luigi with Mario and his \"twin\", Luigi runs faster and jumps higher than Mario does. But a disadvantage about him is that he has lower traction than Mario. He is also taller than Mario, but shorter than the Non-Playable Luigi.Characters Playable Supporting Non-Playable Characters Enemies New Returning Bosses Transformations and Abilities Transformations  Super Mario Galaxy introduces new transformations and only reuses the Fire Flower powerup from previous games (Rainbow Star replacing the Star from other games).Galaxies & Missions  (*) = Unlocked by feeding a Hungry Luma.Trading Cards  The game featured its very own Trading Card game. It was an expression of a celebration for the game's release. The card game features 5 types of cards: Regulars, Trivias, Foils, Standees and FunTats.Mistakes  A few misprints were made in the cards, that includes:Trivia References  Super Mario Galaxy Instruction BookletExternal links King Boo  King Boo is the leader and king of the Boos and the arch enemy of Luigi. He first appears in Luigi's Mansion as the main antagonist. He is sinister, clever, and determined. His powers include causing objects to appear out of thin air, breathing fire, shooting ice, strong tornado-like breath, and the ability to jump incredibly high. He released all of the portraits' ghosts and trapped Mario behind a painting. King Boo also appears in Mario Kart: Double Dash!! and Mario Kart Wii as an unlockable racer. In Double Dash!! he teams up with Petey Piranha.History Luigi's Mansion  In Luigi's Mansion, Luigi wins a very own, fancy mansion from a contest he did not really even enter or think about entering, but decides to invite Mario over anyway. Mario wanders on alone and King Boo later catches him and traps him in a painting. Luigi, in the meantime, has no clue that the mansion is haunted or Mario is kidnapped. Later, after encountering a group of ghosts, Luigi meets a professor named Professor E.Gadd who gives him the Poltergust 3000 and tells Luigi how the Boos freed all of his Portrait Ghosts. Luigi then sets off to save Mario, but later on, he ends up in a storage room and frees all fifty Boos, as well as King Boo himself; Luigi then obtains a Boo Radar for his Game Boy Horror. Halfway through his quest, Luigi discovers where King Boo has been keeping Mario and sets off to find the key to his room.  At the final battle, King Boo pilots a giant Bowser mecha (intricately made to look just like Bowser, although a false Bowser) to help him battle Luigi. The player must defeat him by tossing a spike ball at the Bowser robot's head and then sucking up King Boo like a regular Boo. Afterwards, King Boo is defeated, Mario is rescued, and King Boo ends up in a portrait.Super Mario Sunshine  King Boo returns again in Super Mario Sunshine, in which he is the boss of episode five of Sirena Beach. To reach him, Mario must head to the casino of Hotel Delfino and Ground Pound a purple platform, which is later sent to the bottom level. At the bottom level King Boo appears after he does a creepy laugh and the wheel will start to rotate; ground pounding the purple platforms will stop one section of the wheel. Mario must defeat him by tossing peppers into his mouth (after a slot result gives Mario fruit) and then tossing another fruit at the Boo. Doing this three times earns Mario a Shine Sprite. In Super Mario Sunshine, however, instead of being a Boo with a crown and sharper teeth, he is wider, fatter, and drooling.Mario Kart: Double Dash!!  In Mario Kart: Double Dash!!, King Boo is a hidden character who is unlocked after the player finishes the Star Cup on Mirror Mode, making him one of the toughest characters to unlock. He is paired with Petey Piranha and like his partner he is a heavyweight; however, his kart (the Boo Pipes) is a heavy kart with the speed of a lightweight kart. He can also use any Special Item.Super Mario 64 DS  In Super Mario 64 DS, Mario must defeat him to save Luigi, his brother and unlock him in gameplay. Luigi is an optional character who is required to collect all 150 Power Stars. Mistakenly, King Boo was called Big Boo, who was a 2-time boss at his own haunt.Mario Superstar Baseball  In Mario Superstar Baseball, he is a minor playable character in the power category who is on Wario's team in adventure mode and is a starter character. King Boo bats and pitches right-handed.Super Princess Peach  King Boo appears in Shriek Mansion. However, the lanterns go out. As a result, the Toad will fade with the bubble and the three Boos. King Boo suddenly becomes less transparent and the crown lands on his head. King Boo has few starting attacks: floating towards Peach and send blue fireballs. To attack him, Peach should use the Rage vibe to lighten up the four lanterns. As a result, King Boo will disappear and his crown falls to the ground. He reverses the lanterns off and continues the battle. When he has low life, he cries with many tears to extinguish the lanterns. After finishing him off, he enlarges, disappears and his crown explodes. This rewards her the kidnapped Toad.Mario Kart DS  In Mario Kart DS, he is a boss in the fourth level mission mode, the playab character is Peach. Here, the player has to collect fifty coins from him. When he takes them, the player must try to get them when he is teleporting and continue collecting coins.Mario Kart Wii  In Mario Kart Wii, he is a heavyweight hidden character who can be unlocked after the player finishes the Star Cup on 50cc or if the player plays a total of 750 races. Despite being an excellent handler, King Boo is a mid-tier character for his poor raising stats. King Boo is a good choice for courses with tight turns, such as Rainbow Road. Despite his mid-tier placing, King Boo has great rivalries with other characters and has excellent racing skills, making him a character with high-tier or possibly top-tier character categories since his handling stat raises any kart or bike, including the Spear.Mario Kart 8 Deluxe  King Boo returns to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe as a new playable character along with Bowser Jr., Dry Bones, Inkling Girl, Inkling Boy, and Gold Mario. He is controlled by the 200cc staff ghost, Nin\u2605Rui (from Portugal) on a Wild Wiggler with Sponge tires and Flower Glider with the time of 1:38.244 for Twisted Mansion.Mario Kart Trivia Mario Party 8  King Boo is the host of his own board entitled King Boo's Haunted Hideaway in Mario Party 8. He'll force the players to traverse through his rearranging mansion and find him at one of three altars (the other two being traps). If a player does manage to find him, the player can buy a Star for ten coins. He would then send all the players out and rearrange the mansion. The player could also buy King Boo's sounds and a figurine titled \"King Boo's Revenge\".Mario Party 9  King Boo appears to be the third stage boss in Boo's Horror Castle with his own boss minigame, King Boo's Puzzle Attack.Mario Super Sluggers  He appears as a playable character. He spectated the game at Wario City, turning invisible to not be seen by Bowser Jr. In story mode, King Boo will refuse to join your team unless a Boo is on it. He also gives the hints which are \"error item\" and \"in a box\".Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon  King Boo returns as the main antagonist of Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon. He is seen destroying the Dark Moon in the opening cutscene, causing all the ghosts of Evershade Valley to lose control and run rampant throughout the mansions located there. Though he does not reveal himself to Professor E. Gadd and Luigi at first, numerous Boos are seen throughout the game, and the king himself makes several cameos before his grand appearance, all of which are short, subtle, and with his back turned.\u00a0 In several security camera images seen in the game, Boos are seen carrying a sack with an odd portrait of what appears to be a person.\u00a0 When Luigi gets to the last mansion, the Treacherous Mansion, he shines his light into the dark entrance.\u00a0 When he sees nothing, he turns around and looks for anything that may be behind him.\u00a0 After he turns around, King Boo appears and grins at him menacingly.\u00a0 Once Luigi rescues the two Toad Curators from the Treacherous Mansion, the final security image reveals that the painting being carried around is in fact Mario, who has been once again imprisoned by King Boo.\u00a0 King Boo, also in the image with his back turned, suddenly turns around and reveals himself to E. Gadd and Luigi, and causes the lab's screen to go fuzzy. Luigi goes into the Mansion's train exhibit to ambush the king, only to be attacked by a Big Boo made of ten smaller Boos that Luigi shoots to the train.\u00a0 Luigi defeats Big Boo, and then the Tough Possessor to nab the final piece of the Dark Moon.\u00a0 However, before he can return to the lab, Luigi's Pixelation is intercepted by King Boo, and Luigi is sucked into his illusion.\u00a0 There, King Boo taunts Luigi and confesses that he destroyed the Dark Moon and trapped Mario in a painting so he could seek revenge on Luigi and become ruler of the world.\u00a0 An intense battle ensues, and ends with King Boo being once again trapped in the Poltergust 5000 and Luigi stealing the ruby atop his crown.\u00a0 Oddly enough, King Boo is not seen in the Boo Vault after the game's completion.\u00a0 However, he can be re-fought as many times as the player would like in the level King Boo's Illusion.\u00a0 Though it is not officially revealed how King Boo escaped his painting, E. Gadd notes that he \"shouldn't have sold it at a garage sale\", implying that there may be have been some external force helping to free King Boo.Mario & Luigi: Paper Jam  King Boo is seen at Gloomy Woods during the second visit where he has taken control over the forest. King Boo makes his presence known where Mario, Luigi, and Paper Mario inspect an odd tree. Luigi runs off scared but when he returns seconds later, it is shown King Boo has captured Mario and Paper Mario forcing Luigi to look for them alone. Mario and Luigi eventually reunite and find Paper Mario on the other side. However, it turns out to be King Boo in disguise and then fights them in battle.Attacks Trivia Koopa Troopa  Koopa Troopas are recurring common enemies in the Mario series. They are turtle-like creatures who hide in their shells when someone stomps on themselves. The Koopa Troopa is the most common classification of Koopa. Koopa Troopas are often troopers in the Koopa Troop. Koopa Troopas come in four colors: Green, Red, Blue, and Yellow. If an enemy is referred to as just \"Koopa,\" this usually means Koopa Troopa. The green Koopa Troopas will walk off cliffs, while the red Koopa Troopas will walk back and forth. There is also a bigger variant of the Koopa Troopa called Giant Koopa.Appearances Mario Bros.  Koopa Troopas did not appear in Mario Bros., but enemies that are called Shellcreepers to resemble them. In all remakes, they are replaced by Spinies.Super Mario Bros.  In Super Mario Bros., they were renamed \"Koopa Troopa\", and Koopa Paratroopas made their debut. They can be used as projectiles after they retreat into their shells. Green Koopas simply walked forwards, turning around if they encountered a wall or another enemy, and if they reached a ledge, would walk straight off, even into a bottomless pit. Red Koopas were mentioned in the manual as being more powerful than their green counterparts. In the game, this meant they had the sense not to walk off edges.Super Mario Bros. 3  In Super Mario Bros. 3, Koopa Troopas had generally stayed the same as in Super Mario Bros. One thing that changed was when they return to their shells, they can be carried and kicked away to destroy blocks or hit enemies. Koopa Troopas in their shells could be carried into the air as well.Super Mario World  Super Mario World brought drastic changes to the Koopa Troopa. In this game, Koopa Troopas finally started walking on two legs and wearing shoes. Also, like in Mario Bros., stomping on Koopas ejects them from their shells rather than causing them to hide. An ejected Koopa will slide out of its shell, wearing only a t-shirt, and will crawl back to its shell after being temporarily stunned. Their shells can still be carried. The game also featured Blue and Yellow Koopas. A Koopa that reentered a yellow shell would flash and turns invincible against certain of Mario abilities, such as fireballs and normal jumps, and he will chase after Mario, sliding around inside the shell. The blue Koopa appears to be stronger than the other ones as he is ejected from his shell, and unlike the other Koopas, he doesn't enter again in his shell, but he grabs it and kicks it as Mario does instead. If Yoshi ate a Red, Blue, or Yellow shell, he would gain a different ability until he swallowed or spit the shell out. Eating a flashing shell gave all three abilities at the same time. When the player finds or completes all goals, a different shell will appear on Koopa Troopas. The game also introduces the Super Koopas, that use no shell and fly with a cape towards Mario. If a player stomps on a Super Koopa with a flashing cape, he gains a Cape FeatherSuper Mario 64  In Super Mario 64, Koopa Troopas wear boxers after being knocked out. Their shells can be used as skateboards and can also be used to slide over lava. Koopa Troopas in this game appears in various sizes, as exemplified by Koopa the Quick.Paper Mario  The Paper Mario series introduces friendly Koopas that have their own towns, such as Kooper, Koops, etc. However, it also introduced some pretty evil Koopas, such as the Koopa Bros. and Tutankoopa. Other forms of Koopas, such as the Koopatrols and the giant Tubba Blubba. Others are Hammer Bros., Lakitu, etc. But, Koopas are nice sometimes. An example of such a Koopa is Koopa the Quick, first appearing in Super Mario 64, who races the player in Bob-omb Battlefield and Tiny-Huge Island. Generic Koopa Troopas have also appeared throughout the Mario Party series as NPCs. Like Toad, they are generally helpful towards the players, usually providing them with rewards or running mini-games.Mario Power Tennis  Koopa Troopa reappears in\u00a0Mario Power Tennis\u00a0as a playable character, where he is classified as speedy. His\u00a0Offensive Power Shot\u00a0is the\u00a0Water Bomb, where Koopa performs a special drop shot that forces the characters to get close to the net. His other special move, the\u00a0Defensive Power Shot\u00a0named\u00a0Water Shell Dash, consists of saving the loose ball by hiding into his shell and homing into the ball to make the return. Paratroopa is also present in this game. Koopa Troopa's default partner is\u00a0Yoshi. Koopa Troopa's\u00a0Mario Power Tennis\u00a0trophy animation begins with him walking on stage with Luigi, Mario, and Peach congratulating him for his victory;\u00a0Diddy Kong\u00a0is also there, eating bananas. He then throws a banana peel in Koopa Troopa's path, unaware of where he is walking; and with Koopa Troopa not paying attention. Mario, Luigi, and Peach try to warn him, but he slips onto his shell and slides across the stage, ricochets off a pole and hits Luigi in the head, making him drop the trophy. Koopa Troopa then catches it.Super Paper Mario  In Super Paper Mario, green-shelled Koopas wearing shades are introduced rather than the red-shelled ones. It is also shown that the Koopa Troopas that are wearing the shades have been brainwashed into serving Count Bleck.New Super Mario Bros.  In New Super Mario Bros. they are basically the same as in Super Mario World, they walk on two legs, the wear shoes and can still be carried. Both green and red Koopa Troopas appear and have the same functions as in the other games. The Blue Koopa Shell appears as a power-up in the multiplayer Ice stage. They can also be used as flotation devices in water.Super Mario Galaxy  In Super Mario Galaxy, they are semi-common enemies found mostly on the airship levels. Strangely enough, they are shown walking on all fours, like in SMB and SMB3, and always show an angry-looking expression. They did not flee from Mario like in Super Mario 64 and instead patrolled a set area; which was a straight line for Green Koopa Troopas and a small circle for Red Koopa Troopas. Also, unlike in Super Mario 64, Koopa Troopas can actually hurt Mario in this game. As usual, jumping on a Koopa will cause it to retreat into its shell, but they can be defeated permanently by attacking with a Ground Pound. Attacking with a spin will defeat the Koopa and also spin the shell into Mario's hands so it can be used. In some areas, upon defeating a Koopa, another Koopa will spawn in its place. Koopa shells also appear as common items which can be thrown to defeat enemies and smash open chests or held onto underwater in order to swim faster; red shells travel faster than green shells and home in on enemies, while the green shell goes in a straight trajectory.Mario Spin-offs  Single Koopa Troopas have been playable in Mario Kart games and variou sport games along with Paratroopas. In Mario Kart: Double Dash!!, the Koopa Troopa's signature item was Triple Green Shells, while the Paratroopa's signature item was Triple Red Shells. Koopa Troopa shells, either\u00a0Green or\u00a0Red, are available as items and have different abilities.Mario Party series Mario Party  In Mario Party, Koopa stands at the beginning of each board and when players pass him he gives them money.Mario Party 2 and Mario Party 3  Koopa's role in both 2 & 3 is the owner of the Koopa Bank. When a player passes by the Bank, Koopa takes 5 coins from that player. If less than 5, Koopa would take all of the remaining coins. If a player lands on the Bank Space, Koopa would give all the coins of the bank to that player. In Mario Party 3, Koopa is a partner in Duel Mode. He has low attacks, low defense and low salary.Mario Party 4  In Mario Party 4, Koopa became the host of the show alongside Toad, Goomba, Shy Guy, and Boo.Mario Party 5  In Mario Party 5, Koopa appears as a Bank owner and the star of the mini-game Flower Shower, where he got married to a female Koopa.Mario Party 8  Koopa also had a board in Mario Party 8 that was named Koopa's Tycoon Town. There were Koopa bellhops standing in front of hotels, and asked the players to buy their hotel with coins. When a player landed on a lucky space, a Koopa Driver appeared, and took the player to the lucky road, where the player could collect coins and buy a 3-Star hotel for only 1 coin. Multiple Koopas also appeared on the Train and in crowds.Mario Party 9  Koopa appears for the first time as a main playable character, selectable from the beginning of the game.Mario Party 10  Koopa Troopas appear in Mario Party 10 as non-playable characters, appearing in the background of the mini-game Shy Guy Shuffle.Mario Kart series  Koopa Troopa first appeared in Super Mario Kart. He then later re-appeared in Mario Kart: Double Dash!! and in Mario Kart Wii. He is a standard character in every game he has appeared in. In Super Mario Kart he shared racing characteristics with Toad as a beginner's racer with top-notch handling. In Mario Kart: Double Dash!! and Mario Kart Wii he is classified as a light type character. Koopa Troopa is set to appear in Mario Kart 7 as a playable character.Staff Ghost Tracks Trivia References Items  Many items can be found throughout the Mario games.Wario  \u00a0 Wario (\u30ef\u30ea\u30aa) is a character in the Mario series. He is the counterpart of Mario and is known to be very greedy. Although he began as an antagonist, he developed into more of an anti-hero, starring in his own spin-off titles such as Wario Land.Biography  First seen in Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins as the final boss, Wario became quite popular, starring his own game titled Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3. Wario's defining features include his jagged mustache, purple and yellow attire, huge belly, and his massive strength. Despite his appearance, Wario is shown to be very strong and a great fighter. He has shown to have much prowess and has defeated enemies far bigger than him in size. Wario has two different outfits- his classic overall attire, and his biker outfit shown in all WarioWare games. It was once stated in the Nintendo Power Magazines that Wario is the cousin of the Mario Bros. but this has never been confirmed, however. He also shares a mysterious relationship with Waluigi, likely theory is that he is his brother, though not confirmed. He is voiced by Charles Martinet.Reputation & Moral Standing  Despite some of Wario's past attempts and actions, he may actually not necessarily be a bad guy but instead neutral, just driven by greed or his own goals. This is notable through his adventures starting in his first appearance in Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins, he had attempted to take over Mario Land and steal Mario's castle. Greedy and villainous indeed, however also clever as he intentionally drew Mario out of Mario land to do so and proceeded to hypnotize the inhabitants. After defeated, he is homeless and proceeds to actually find Princess Peach's stolen statue of her to return it for the reward to be able to obtain his goal/dream of owning a castle, or just to have a place to live. The statue was unfortunately taken from him by Mario, ironically making Mario seem rather underhanded and slightly villainous as Wario did all the work and Mario carried the statue off with his plane using a magnet. Wario still got his home in the end depending on how much money the player made in game (as a bonus, if the player got 99,999 coins and all the treasure and completes all the levels, Wario obtains his own planet. This isn't canonical as this is never referenced in any other games but rather the second best ending of Wario receiving his own grand castle does appear to be the canonical ending.) and Wario lived relatively peacefully until Wario Land 2 where his castle was raided by Captain Syrup's goons, thus he was not causing any harm. After defeating her as well, he also does nothing wrong in the third game but misfortune has it that Wario's plane crashes and he is tasked with supposedly freeing a magical sealed being who will return him to his home with any treasure he obtains along the way. In the end after defeating the actually malevolent clown Rudy who tricked him, Wario is returned to his world with his treasure as promised by the beings that had sealed Rudy away. A victorious outcome for Wario having played the heroic role by unintentionally saving the land. He had not caused problems for anyone. In fact he had saved possibly many people. This also goes into the next game where Wario had simply gone excavating for treasure after hearing of an uncovered pyramid ruin. He ended up trapped in the pyramid and had to fight his way out, collecting plenty of treasure and defeating the spirit of a greedy old woman. Ironic yet fitting in that Wario, from his own greed, overcame another greedy spirit. He then took the treasure and escaped the pyramid, even earning a kiss from a princess of beauty varying on how well you did. The worst being a short rather ugly princess, the second worse being a princess with the same facial features as Wario himself, (both of those endings showing Wario's obvious discomfort/disappointment at the reward.) the other endings being of actual beautiful princesses (with Wario having a big grin in contrast to the 'bad' endings). Wario then drives off in his car with treasure in tow as the sun sets and the background begins showing images of Wario's adventure and possibly aftermath. Wario: Master of Disguise has Wario finding out about a thief namer \"The White Zephyr\" who has the ability to change his form and disguise himself perfectly. Wario, out of envy, shows off surprisingly advanced technologic capabilities by creating the telmet to enter the television and teleport directly to The White Zephyr. This is a surprising show of Wario's resourcefulness and intelligence when drawing from his great determination caused by his greed. This helps to prove that he is not necessarily evil, just greedy and determined. Wario World features Wario finding an ancient gem treasure that turned out to be an evil spirit that launched him to its world. Wario simply did what he does best and blast his way through it, collecting treasure and defeats the evil gem and returns to his world. Wario Land: Shake It! is much of the same with Wario being sent a globe by Captain Syrup and getting sucked into the globe to some strange new dimension that he is then, with promises of a great treasure to make it worthwhile to him, tasked with saving it from the shake king. Syrup suspiciously enough acts like an ally in this game despite previous run-ins with her, however ultimately she gets her revenge by betraying him and stealing the infinite coin bag from Wario at the end of the entire journey. This is the second time he's left with nothing out of the whole ordeal. Of all these games, Wario has only once been the villain, and every other occasion has been the hero, saving worlds and dimensions from great evils and profiting off of it, though he has never started any of these adventures willingly without some ulterior motive of his. As such, Wario is more of a neutral character than anything else. He just looks for what he'll gain out of the ordeal.Other Game Appearances  Wario is seen in quite a lot of Mario games. He appears in all the Mario Party (except Mario Party Advance) games, Mario Kart games, and all Mario sports games. He also appears in Super Mario 64 DS, Densetsu no Stafy 3, New Super Mario Bros., Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games and acted as main antagonist of Wario's Woods. He starred in Wario Blast: Featuring Bomberman as well, and was one of the Mario characters who replaces Mr. Game and Watch. Baby Wario is a protagonist (though for selfish reasons) in Yoshi's Island DS.Mario Kart series  Wario is always classed as a heavyweight in the Mario Kart games following Super Mario Kart (in which he didn't appear). From Mario Kart 64 through Mario Kart DS, Wario's standard kart was purple. In Mario Kart Wii it has changed to yellow in light of his hat color. Wario returns in Mario Kart 7 for Nintendo 3DS. He is a heavyweight racer again and is now an unlockable racer for the first time in the Mario Kart series. He follows his unlockable trait with Waluigi in Mario Kart Arcade GP DX. His Staff Ghost tracks are:Mario Party series  Wario has been in the Mario Party series since the first game and has played a large role in the series. He has his own level in Mario Party known as Wario's Battle Canyon which stands as one of its hardest. Wario's color is purple, and in Mario Parties 1-5 his sleeves are long, but in the rest, they are short. In Mario Party 2, Wario is the cause of the storyline, as he wants Mario Land to be named Wario Land. This starts the argument that develops the party. Wario introduced Waluigi to the rest of his \"pals\" in Mario Tennis. Later, he introduced Waluigi once again in Mario Party 3. In that game, Wario's battle partner is a Bob-omb. Wario is also revealed to have a \"secret friend\" bond with Toadette.Super Smash Bros. Brawl  Wario was a newcomer in Super Smash Bros. Brawl for the Wii. He was a member of the Evil Subspace Army, along with Bowser and Ganondorf. His attacks are mostly from Wario Ware. He also came with a stage called Wario Ware Inc.Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U  In Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, Wario was an unlockable character, the third unlockable character in the 3DS version and the second in the Wii U Version. He also comes with the WarioWare Inc stage (3DS) and Gamer from Game and Wario Stage (Wii U). Here is his moveset:Other appearances  Wario has also been seen in the South Park Imaginationland trilogy as one of the many villains fighting against the heroes. However, Wario has a \"V\" instead of a \"W\" on his hat and gloves as seen in the image.Abilities Wario Land series  In the Wario Land series, Wario could attack enemies or be attacked, resulting in strange \"power-ups\" that were necessary to beat the game. His main attacks were a body slam that make a \"ch-ch-ch-ch\" sound when being used and a ground pound that shook the earth beneath him. In Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3 for Game Boy and Wario Land for the Virtual Boy, Wario could pick up different hats that gave him different powers. In Wario Land II and Wario Land 3, Wario was invincible to enemy attacks but isn't naturally invincible (Because in the game over in both games it shows that he was dreaming.)but they could affect him in other ways, such as turning him into a zombie, making his face swell up in order to float, or being frozen. Some of the \"power-ups\" were helpful (catching him on fire to break blocks with a flame symbol on them) and some were a nuisance (getting frozen and sliding away from his destination until hitting a wall). In Wario Land: Shake It! he is shown being capable of using all his standard attacks but is also capable of shaking enemies very fast to shake money and healing items (head of garlic) out of them. He is also capable of throwing enemies like previous games but much stronger and in various directions. One other new move he had was the ability to shake the world around him by striking the ground with unbelievable strength which could cause enemies all around him to be thrown into the air and become stunned or weakened when they hit the ground. It also cause blocks and pillars as well as parts of the world to shift, rise, or fall, set off any bomb blocks in the vicinity, or uncover secret maps. It is also in this game that Wario obtained a life bar and therefor was capable of being damaged and defeated though this still doesn't seem to be an issue with when he is lit on fire or shot out of cannons or flattened, etc.Wario World  Wario had a body slam and ground pound in Wario World as well as four new attacks. Wario gained punching abilities, which led to the other two attacks. When a larger enemy was punched into unconsciousness, Wario could either do a piledriver, a spin attack, or a throw attack to finish them off. All of the attacks hurt other enemies around him, gaining him a lot of coins which he could inhale to collect faster (the inhaling does not count as an attack, it's just a useful ability).WarioWare  Wario has no real attacks in the WarioWare series, but he does use WarioWare themed special attacks in Super Smash Bros. Brawl including riding his motorcycle around on the stage to attack other players. However, in WarioWare he sometimes turns into a superhero named \"Wario Man\", which is also his final smash in Super Smash Bros. Brawl.Relationships Mario  Wario and Mario have been rivals since their first encounter. Wario often tries to hinder Mario's progress whenever the plumber gets in his way. Wario is also shown to be jealous of Mario's relationship with Princess Peach as in Mario Power Tennis, Wario (and Waluigi) was furious to see Mario receive a kiss from Peach. However, Wario and Mario do tend to get along with each other in some games. In the Mario Party series, Wario is often an ally of Mario. Another example of the two working together is shown in Super Mario 64 DS where they both went to Princess Peach's Castle (though, it is likely that he was not doing it for Mario or the Princess.)Waluigi  Wario and Waluigi are shown to be the best of friends and are often seen in mainly shown in games like Mario Power Tennis and Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour where they often cause mischief to others. It should be noted that Waluigi generally appears in a game if Wario is around, except in Mario Power Tennis, where Wario's partner was Bowser and in the Wario franchise where he has yet to appear.Mona  Mona is Wario's love interest from WarioWare, and he is stricken with her. He and Mona are never seen together, but it is known they dance together at Club Sugar and meet at Mona's Pizza Palace and Wario's House. In WarioWare Gold, she plans for the \"perfect dress\" for the party. She even mentioned about the dress to be \"cool like Wario\" and referred him as her \"fashion icon\". At the end of the plot, she thought he was going to pay them. She was one of them who decides the split the money equally and ignores Wario.Bowser  Bowser and Wario are on opposite sides in the Mario Party series but have been seen working together in Mario Power Tennis, as to defeat Mario as their main goal. Not much else is known though. However, the two of them downright hate other and view each other as enemies. Another example of being enemies is; while both of them are very greedy, Wario has a heart of gold deep down and occasionally shares his money with his friends like in the WarioWare series. But Bowser on otherhand dosen't.Trivia Toad (character)  Toad, also known as (Kinopio \u30ad\u30ce\u30d4\u30aa in Japan) , is a fictional humanoid mushroom that is both a single character and the collective name of the \"Mushroom People\" found in the Mushroom Kingdom. The Toad species first appeared in Super Mario Bros. as seven guards that serve Princess Peach, called Mushroom Retainers. In games prior to Paper Mario, which features an entire race of Toad inhabiting Toad Town, the capital of the Mushroom Kingdom, manuals referred to them as Mushroom People, but they were always referred to as Kinopio in Japanese languages. As a singular character, Toad is known for being the long time servant and attendant of Princess Peach. He constantly tries to protect her; however, he prominently fails almost every time during the events of her kidnapping. Despite his cowardice, Toad is notable for being one of the few characters who help the Mario Bros. through a variety of different ways throughout their adventures. Toad has even made his own fair share of heroic contributions as seen in games such as in Wario's Woods (a game that features Toad himself as the main hero) and Super Mario Bros. 2.Biography  Toad first appears as a singular character in Super Mario Bros. 2 as one of the four playable characters. In the game's story, he and his three friends (Mario, Luigi, and Princess Peach) had to help the people of the land of Subcon by defeating the villainous frog (known as Wart) from taking over their kingdom. Among the four characters, Toad was both the strongest and fastest character; however, he had the worst jumps. Toad himself is stated to be the chief guard of the Mushroom Retainers (Toad who were kidnapped in the events of the previous game, Super Mario Bros.). In Super Mario Bros. 3, he begins the story by writing a letter to Princess Peach warning her about Bowser and the Koopalings who were taking over the Mushroom Kingdom and asks her to send help. He also appears in the game by helping Mario and Luigi through running the Toad's Houses (areas that provided power-ups or extra lives for the Mario Bros.). The character then goes on to star in Wario's Woods where he prevents Wario from taking over the Mushroom Kingdom with his monsters. Thanks to his own courage and the help of Birdo and the fairy named Wanda, Toad manages to defeat Wario in the end and chase him out of the Woods (thus reversing the antagonist's control over the woods and monsters). For the next few years, Toad appears in many of the Mario spin-off games such as the Mario Kart\u00a0series Mario Party\u00a0series\u00a0(where he is often featured as a playable character) and various other sports games. Toad appears in the various Mario 3D series games such as Super Mario 64 where he was the first Toad that Mario met in Peach's castle and he explains much of the back story of what had happened to Mario. In Super Mario Sunshine, Toad (as he was named in the instruction booklet) accompanied the princess, Mario and Toadsworth with four other Toads to Isle Delfino as one of her attendants. In the Super Mario Galaxy games, he is the captain of the Toad Brigade (naming himself as so by having a head lamp). As a result, he was named as the Toad Brigade Captain by his fellow Toad Brigade members. Much of Toad's original personality is retained in the Galaxy games (once again being impatient and cowardly yet loyal) and he assists Mario on his adventure throughout the galaxies in this game as well as its sequel. In Super Mario 3D Land, Toad plays the role as Mario's sidekick as he continually assists the hero by providing him with assistance through the red Toad Houses (which Toad himself runs) and the provision of cannons for the airship levels. Toad also appears in a certain few levels where he must be spotted through the binoculars to see the help he would provide (such as tossing down star coins near to Mario or providing free power-ups/1-Up Mushrooms). Toad also makes a brief appearance in Super Smash Bros. Melee, in which he can be seen running back and forth frantically in the first stage of adventure mode. He is also a collectible trophy. He is also one of Princess Peach's attacks in which she throws Toad in front of herself to take the blow of a foe's attack; this attack of Peach's will be reused in Super Smash Bros. Brawl. There, he will also appear as a sticker. In other games, he acts as an instructor, such as in the earlier Mario Party games, and helps guide characters in other games. As with the games, Toad plays a major supporting character in other forms of media starring Mario. He usually tags along with Mario in the various cartoons and comics as a sidekick. In the Super Mario Bros. live-action film, Toad (portrayed by Mojo Nixon) was re-imagined as a street musician and one of the poor inhabitants of Dinohattan, all of whom were descended from dinosaurs; unhappy with King Koopa's rule, Toad was placed under arrest by King Koopa's police force for singing \"anti-Koopa songs\" and placed in custody, where he befriends Mario and Luigi. Toad is later forcibly devolved into a Goomba, but apparently retains his humanity, as evidenced by his kindness towards Princess Daisy and the fact that he aids Mario and Luigi, giving them the devolution gun that is ultimately used to end the threat of King Koopa. He is well known for the quote \"Thank you, Mario, but our princess is in another castle\" from Super Mario Bros..Appearances Super Mario Bros. series  Toad is often seen as a recurring character within the Super Mario Bros. titles. He is often seen to as a major supporting character in these games. Additionally, he is occasionally playable within the series at the times when he teams up with the Mario Bros. to stop the evil forces.Super Mario Bros. 2  Super Mario Bros. 2\u00a0introduced Toad as a singular character, and in this game, he was a playable character; thus marking him as the very first playable toad. He, along with Mario, Luigi, and Peach, traveled the land of Subcom in hopes of defeating the evil King Wart. In this game, Toad exhibited several unique abilities as he was the fastest character in the game and was also the strongest of the four characters (being able to uproot vegetables more quickly than the other three characters). However, he has poor jumps, though his super/charged jumps (triggered by charging up) can compensate for this in most cases.Super Mario Bros. 3  Toad began the adventure of Super Mario Bros. 3 by sending a letter to Princess Peach for help as the Koopalings were attacking and taking over the lands of the Mushroom Kingdom. Toad later appears in the game as one of the major allies for the Mario Bros. by running the Toad's Houses. In these houses, the Mario Bros. can play mini-games in order to win either extra power-ups or lives.Super Mario 64  Toad, along with Princess Peach and the rest of the Toads at her castle, was sealed behind the walls in the events of Super Mario 64 by Bowser. While he was not able to help Mario as much as he did in the past, Toad still provided the back story to Mario (upon his arrival to the castle) of what had happened to both Princess Peach's Castle and as well as Peach herself. Toad would then request for Mario to recover the Power Stars in order to save everyone. Toad soon begins Mario's adventure by telling him of the first area that he can get a Power Star. In the remake Super Mario 64 DS, Toad plays a very similar role to his original one from Super Mario 64. However, his tone of speaking appears to change depending on what character he is speaking to (for example he praises Mario and Yoshi; however, he appears to forget who Luigi is). Toad through some means is also able to recover either Mario's, Luigi's, or Wario's caps if they lose it in a previous level. If the capless hero is able to obtain a Power Star from another level (not the one that he had lost his cap), Toad would then be seen wearing the hero's cap and would happily give it back to its owner.Super Mario Sunshine  Toad plays the role of one of Princess Peach's attendants who accompany her and Mario on their journey to the paradise land known as Isle Delfino in Super Mario Sunshine. He is seen with a red vest in this game; however, it is implied from sources (such as the instruction booklet) that this character is indeed Toad himself. Throughout the events of the game, Toad would mostly be seen worrying about Peach after her kidnapping. However, he does provided some useful advice for Mario such as the information of how to perform the \"Box Break\" move (known as the Ground Pound in other games). In the end of the game, Toad and the other Toad attendants were able to fix F.L.U.D.D. after Mario's final battle with Bowser and Bowser Jr.. During the staff roll, Toad is seen enjoying himself in the finally recovered paradise of Isle Delfino.Super Mario Galaxy  Toad plays a crucial role in Super Mario Galaxy by being the captain of the Toad organization named as the Toad Brigade (as confirmed by official biographies for the game). In recognition of his status, Toad is referred to as Captain or the Toad Brigade Captain for most of the game. Toad is recognizable by the headlamp that he wears on his head at all times, and as well as his large backpack. Toad also owns a special spaceship called a Starshroom in this game. While he is determined to rescue Princess Peach, Toad is often cowardly and relies on Mario to back him up on various Galaxies. While he is not seen to be fighting, Toad is shown to be able to defeat Boos by shining his bright headlamp light at them. At some levels, Toad even finds some Power Stars for Mario and even points some of the other ones out to him as well. At the end of the game, Toad reveals to Mario that he and the rest of his brigade have been promoted to becoming royal guards for Peach.Super Mario Galaxy 2  Toad returns as the cowardly, yet trying leader of the Toad Brigade in Super Mario Galaxy 2. As this game has more character backgrounds revealed, Toad is shown to be rather not trusted by his brigade as they believe that he is not fit for being captain. Regardless, Toad tries his best and tries to find Power Stars to help Mario (which he does successfully to some extent for a few times). However, he does occasionally need Mario's help as Toad sometimes finds himself in trouble while trying to obtain Power Stars. Like the first game, he is overly cautious; however, it is also revealed that he is also a bit of a slacker as he often daydreams about taking vacation rests at various planets and galaxies. In the Bowser levels, it is ironically Toad himself (out of the Toad Brigade) who seems to be the most brave as he is often seen cheerful (as he usually is) and brining coins for Mario so that he could recover any lost health. In Toad is seen celebrating with the rest of protagonists as they return home to the Mushroom Kingdom with the rescued Princess Peach at the end of the game.Super Mario 3D Land  Toad makes a reappearance in Super Mario 3D Land. In this game, he is notable for being the only Red Toad with a blue vest (all other Red Toads have red vests in the game) and can easily be noticed through this difference. He is seen operating the Red Toad Houses which is an area that Mario can go to obtain a free Power-Up from Toad. Toad also operates the cannon that gives Mario access to the airship levels where Boom Boom and Pom Pom lurk. Toad also appears in some of the actual levels where he can be spotted through the binoculars. Whenever he is spotted he will either demonstrate to Mario for how to use a new Power-Up, uncover a secret in the level, or throw a helpful item to the plumber. Mario first meets up with Toad in World 1 through Toad's Toad House; however, he will later need to rescue the Mushroom Retainer from the first False Bowser at the first castle later on. Upon being rescued, Toad will assist Mario for the remainder of his adventure.Wario's Woods  Toad is featured as the main star in both versions (NES and SNES) of the Nintendo puzzle game Wario's Woods. In this game, he rescues the entire Mushroom Kingdom from the wrath of Wario (who is attempting to take over these lands). Throughout the adventure, Toad is helped by his two allies Birdo and Wanda. With their help, Toad uses his superhuman strength to clear his path to Wario by eliminating his minions (through the use of bombs). Throughout the game, Toad is constantly insulted and put down by Wario, the game's main antagonist. Despite this, Toad still completes his duty as the Mushroom Kingdom Hero by defeating Wario and his minions, and lifting the spell off the wooded areas that Wario began his capture of the Kingdom. Depending on the version of the game, Toad is either seen to be chasing Wario out of the woods or bombing Wario's castle at the end of the game. Regardless, it is safe to assume that Toad had successfully defeated Wario by this point in time.Other Appearances Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars  In Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars, Toad is portrayed as one of the Mushroom Retainers and Peach's loyal servant. He is first at Mario's Pad in the intro when he arrives to pick Princess Peach from her visit to Mario. However, he soon becomes panicked once Mario tells him that the Princess has been kidnapped.Toad later is seen accompanying Mario throughout his journey in the forest; however, Toad is frequently kidnapped and rescued several times throughout the adventure. However, in his gratitude upon his rescues, Toad gives Mario several items that would assist him in battle.Toad joins Mario when he speaks with the Chancellor and the other Mushroom Retainers (once they arrive in the Mushroom Kingdom) about Peach's kidnapping. After this point, Toad makes a few cameo appearances such as hiding under Peach's bed during Bowser's attack and being the focus of one of Mario's nightmare. Toad later makes a notable appearance by running a shop in Bowser's Keep in order to support Mario (though it is unknown how he reached here and why he did considering his fear of Bowser in the prior events of the game). Interestingly enough, Toad asks Mario to pay for these items and does not give him the items for free like he did before.Paper Mario series Super Paper Mario  While his species is present in all of the installments of the Paper Mario series, Toad himself did not make an appearance in the series until Super Paper Mario. In this game, Toad begins the adventure of the Mario Bros. by running up to their house and alerting them of the recent event of Princess Peach's absence because someone has kidnapped her. As the Mario Bros. make an assumption and leave towards Bowser's Castle to rescue Peach, Toad stays behind and is seen wishing both of the Mario Bros. luck on their journey. Toad makes a cameo appearance as the 256th and final Catch Card.Paper Mario: Sticker Star  Toad appears again in Paper Mario: Sticker Star. He is usually seen being bullied by enemies in certain levels. Mario has a choice to either fight the enemies, pay them coins, or leave Toad be. Toad lives in the furthest east house in Decalburg where he keeps paintings of his adventures stating how \"bravely\" he fought off the enemies. If Mario rescues Toad five times in the levels of the first five Worlds, Toad will award him with a Hp-Up Heart. Toad can be found in Bouquet Gardens, Drybake Desert, Holey Thicket, Bowser's Snow Fort, and Jungle Rapids.Mario Kart series  Toad has played an important role in the Mario Kart series as he has been playable in all of its installments so far (a trait also shared by Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Bowser, and Yoshi). He has appeared in each game of the series as a lightweight with exceptionally good acceleration stats.Super Mario Kart  Toad appears as a lightweight character alongside Koopa Troopa in Super Mario Kart. His special move in this game is throwing Poison Mushrooms that can temporarily shrink the other characters. This special move is also shared with Princess Peach. His kart is featured in a characteristic blue color in resemblance to his vest (his karts continue to be presented in a blue color in future Mario Kart titles).Mario Kart 64  Toad reappears in the Mario Kart 64 as the only returning lightweight character (as Koopa Troopa has been replaced by Wario). However, he shares his weight class now with both Peach and Yoshi (Both of whom were once middleweights in the previous installment). Toad receives his own course in this game entitled as Toad's Turnpike.Mario Kart: Super Circuit  Toad appears in Mario Kart: Super Circuit once again as a lightweight driver. His statistics are equivalent to Peach, while he appears identical to his statistics in the previous game, Toad retains his original Japanese voice portrayal in this game in all versions of the game.Mario Kart Double Dash!!  Toad reappears as a lightweight driver in Mario Kart: Double Dash!! and is given his own partner known as Toadette. The two Toads are featured as unlockable characters in this game after completing the Special Cup on 100cc, and their special item is the Golden Mushroom. The Golden Mushroom allows the duo to pull consecutive speed boosts until the power of the mushroom runs out. Toad's own kart in this game is named as the \"Toad Kart\" and it bears a strong resemblance to the classic karts that were used in the previous Mario Kart games.Mario Kart DS  Toad appears as a default lightweight character in Mario Kart DS. His three unique karts include the \"Mushmellow\", the \"Standard TD\", and the \"4-Wheel Cradle\". Toad is also featured in several mission modes within the game; most being events involving him running through all the gates in a specified course. One notable mission mode event featuring Toad was his race against the Goomboss in Baby Park.Mario Kart Wii  Toad reappears once again as a default lightweight character in Mario Kart Wii. His karts are shared among all the lightweight characters; however, Toad's own karts are usually featured in a blue or red color pattern. Toad also has his own course in this game entitled as Toad's Factory.Mario Kart 7  Toad appears as a standard playable character in Mario Kart 7. He also has his own circuit.Mario Kart 8  Toad returns in Mario Kart 8\u00a0as a default character. He will once again be classified as a lightweight racer, this time he has two tracks dedicated to him which include: Toad Harbor and Toad's Turnpike from Mario Kart 64.Mario Party series  Toad has played a big role in the Mario Party series as both a playable and non-playable character. Toad was originally introduced as a host in Mario Party and regulated the stars on the boards and explained the mini-game instructions for the characters. He also appeared in a handful of mini-games like Toad in the Box. Later, in Mario Party 4, Toad hosted his own board map. When Mario Party 5 was introduced to the GameCube, Toad became a regular playable character and has appeared on as being playable since this game (the only exception being Mario Party Advance).Mario Party 1-2  Toad originally appeared as the host of the original Mario Party game. In this game, he was responsible in explaining the rules of the boards and mini-games to the characters. He also handed out the stars on different board maps. In certain board maps like Mario's Rainbow Castle, Toad would rotate positions with Bowser at the top of the castle. Toad would hand out stars to the player while Bowser would steal stars from them. Toad also completed with Bowser in Yoshi's Tropical Island where he would hand out stars on one side of the island, while Bowser stole stars on the other side. On board maps like Luigi's Engine Room, Toad would just hand out stars for twenty coins. Toad reprise his role as a host in Mario Party 2. In this game, Toad would both explain the rules of the boards and mini-games, and would also hand stars out to players. At one point in the game, however, Baby Bowser would kick Toad out of his role as a host and take the role of hosting Bowser Land. In addition to hosting the board maps, Toad appeared in a wide variety of games. He appears in Toad in the Box as one of the characters that the player can get on the wooden block. In this mini-game, the characters must collect five Toads in order to win. Toad also appeared in the mini-game Roll Call as one of the Mario characters that the player must count. He also appears as a target that earns the players extra coins in Archer-ival. In different modes in Mario Party 2, a Toad with a turquoise head hosts the events instead of a regular Toad.Mario Party 3-4  Toad appears as a supporting character in Mario Party 3. However, he does not reprise his role as a host for the boards since that duty is fulfilled by the Millennium Star and Tumble. Toad does make an appearance as the Item Shop owner on the board maps. Toad owns his own item shop that contains different lines of Toad items. This includes the Mushroom, Cellular Shopper, and the Magic Lamp. He will seldom approach a character if they land on an Item Space and ask them a question, usually granting them with a wide variety of items, or on a special occasion, rare items. Toad also appears in a few mini-games in Mario Party 3. He appears as the host for the mini-game M.P.I.Q., where he will ask the characters a wide variety of questions to deal with the Mario series characters. He also appears in the mini-game Messy Memory, where a whole group of Toads appear and mess up a room full of items. He also appears as one of the portraits that the characters must replicate in Picture Imperfect. Outside of the mini-games, Toad appears as a partner in duel mode and is the beginning partner for Peach. Toad appears as a host for his own board map in Mario Party 4 called Toad's Midway Madness. This is the first time he has owned his own map. This map contains a wide variety of rides, games, and events. Different Toads host he different games, stores, and events on this board. Toad will also challenge a player in a mini-game called Bowser Bop, where the player must knock out more Koopa Kids than Toad. Outside of the board map, Toad appears as a playable character in the mini-game Beach Volley Folley. However, that was his only role of a playable character until Mario Party 5.Mario Party 5 and Onwards  With the introduction of Mario Party 5, Toad become a regular playable character to the Mario Party series. He was one of the three characters to be added to the playable characters roster in Mario Party 5. When Toadette was introduced in Mario Party 6, Toad was often paired with her when it came to certain events. They even had their own special orb in Mario Party 7 called the Triple 'Shroom Orb, which increased the amount of dice blocks they would get for three turns. Ever since he was added to the playable character roster, Toad has not appeared as a host or side character on boards or in mini-games. That was until in Super Mario Party\"\" he was reverted back to host and game explain duties, it is also revealed in the board, King Bob-omb's Powderkeg Mine, that Toad understands and is able to translate the Bob-omb language.Mario Sports Mix  Despite his absence in Mario Hoops 3-on-3, Toad appears as a lightweight newcomer in Mario Sports Mix. He is classified as a speedy character and is one of the more nimble characters in the game. His special move involves Toad creating large rotating mushrooms out of the ground in order to stun his opponents. Toad is also seen using a variety of mushroom and spore emitting based moves in this game. In the story mode of the game, Toad is first seen gardening in the courtyards of Princess Peach's Castle; however, he stops when he sees a large fiery mass shooting through the sky. Upon its impact in the grounds not too far from the castle, Toad leaves his gardening and rushes into the scene with three other Toads in order to investigate. Upon discovering several odd, shiny crystals, Toad and his friends decide to host a Sports tournament for Mario and co. with the crystals being contained within the trophies awarded to the winners.Abilities  Super Mario Bros. 2 was the first game to have Toad as a playable character and in the game, he played very similar to the other characters by jumping on the enemies in the game and picking up various objects to aid him. However out of the four characters, Toad was the strongest character and as well as the fastest character in terms of running and vegetable uprooting speed. Wario's Woods marked the return of Toad's superhuman strength and the game also gave him the ability to run up walls. His speed from Super Mario Bros. 2 also seems to be implemented in the Mario Kart games as he is often a rather speedy racer. In Mario Party 3, Toad had used a hammer though this has yet to be seen in future games. New Super Mario Bros. Wii gave Toad balanced stats, thus allowing him to play similarly to the Mario Bros.. He also was given abilities such as the ground pound, spin jump, and the wall kick. He is also able to use his superhuman strength to carry objects and characters much larger than himself with ease. He is also capable of using the power-ups in this game, thus giving him forms such as Fire Toad (allows him to shoot fireballs), Propeller Toad (allows him to propel into the sky for flight purposes) and more. Super Mario 3D World\u00a0gives Toad the ability to run very fast unlike in\u00a0New Super Mario Bros. Wii where he was well-balanced. However, he cannot jump very high and falls down quickly. Toad retains the ability to shoot fireballs in his Fire Toad\u00a0form when he obtains the Fire Flower power-up, as well as being able to both climb up walls and perform claw attacks in his Cat Toad\u00a0form once he obtains\u00a0the new Super Bell power-up.\u00a0Voice Portrayals  Toad's voice is first heard in the SNES version of Wario's Woods where he had a rather unusually low voice. Toad's voice is later heard in Mario Kart 64 (only American and PAL version), which features actor Isaac Marshall. By the advent of the GameCube, Jen Taylor has continued to provide the voice of Toad until 2005, when Kelsey Hutchison took over for games such as Super Mario Strikers. Recently, Nicole Mills voiced him in Mario Party 8. Samantha Kelly has recently been taking over the role of his voice as heard in Mario Kart Wii and New Super Mario Bros. Wii. Amanda Roberts took the role since Super Mario Odyssey.Goomba  Goombas are recurring and the most common enemies in the Mario series. They debuted in Super Mario Bros. and are depicted as brown mushroom-like creatures with dark brown legs (whose name in Japanese is Kuribo, meaning chestnut people even if they take inspiration from Shiitake Mushrooms and not chestnuts).Goombas have bushy, black eyebrows and a pair of fangs sprouting from their lower jaw, although they never use their fangs. They bump into an enemy to hurt them. The Goombas once lived in peace in the Mushroom Kingdom, but they later joined the Koopa Troop. The Goombas are also probably the most common enemy in the entire Mario franchise.Appearances  During the last stages of development for Super Mario Bros., play testers were complaining about the Koopa Troopa being a difficult basic enemy. So the development created a symmetrical Goomba sprite, except one shoe was out, so they could make an easy trotting animation by flipping the sprite over and over to save the scarce amount of space left on the cartridge. The sprite was a redesigned mushroom sprite. Now, the Goomba has become a staple Mario enemy since.Super Mario series Super Mario Bros.  This game marks the first appearance of the Goombas. They appear in about any level (excluding underwater levels). Goombas are the easiest to kill, because all Mario has to do is just stomp them. If the player completes the game, the Goombas are replaced by the Buzzy Beetles.Super Mario Bros. 3  Normal Goombas appeared again in the third game in the Super Mario series, which featured alsothree new Goomba species: Paragoomba (winged Goombas, similar to Paratroopas), Micro-Goombas and Grand Goombas. They resume their role of the game's most standard enemy.Super Mario World  Goombas do not appear at the game, but are replaced by similar enemies named Galoombas, though these are listed as Goombas at the game's credits. In addition, Galoombas are not the game's most standard enemies.Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island  In Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island, Goombas made only a short cameo appearance in stage 4-1, GO! GO! MARIO!!. The game's features different colored Shy Guys as the game's most common enemy instead of Goombas. In this game, they flatten after being stomped by Yoshi but return to their normal status after a short time.New Super Mario Bros. 2  Goombas reappear in New Super Mario Bros. 2 and act how they have in previous installments. If a gold ring is passed by, it turns into a Gold Goomba.\u00a0Mario & Luigi Series Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga (+ Bowser's Minions)  In the original GBA version, Goombas are only fought in the beginning of the game, on the Koopa Cruiser. They serve as enemies for battle tutorials. In the 3DS remake, Goombas are not only found in the Koopa Cruiser. They are used as enemies to practice Bros Attacks on in Demo or Practice mode. In the Bowser's Minions side-game, they are obtainable Melee-type troopers.Paper Mario series Paper Mario  In\u00a0Paper Mario,\u00a0Goombas appear early on in Mario's adventure. They are by far the weakest enemies in the game, having only 2 HP, 1 ATK, and 0 DEF. They appear most prominently in\u00a0Goomba Road, also appearing there with\u00a0Paragoombas and Spiky Goombas. In the game's files, there exists a fully functional enemy which is a combination of a Paragoomba and a Spiky Goomba, but was likely scrapped due to its difficulty to defeat, at least early in the game. Paper Mario also introduces Gloombas and Hyper Goombas, which also have their own Para and Spiky counterparts. Goombario is Mario's first partner in the game, having the ability to tattle enemies, reveal their HP, as well as headbonk enemies.Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door  Goombas appear again in\u00a0Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door\u00a0as early-game enemies. They have the exact same stats as in\u00a0Paper Mario, having the lowest HP of any enemy in the game, two.\u00a0Gloombas\u00a0and\u00a0Hyper Goombas\u00a0return from the prequel. There are also non-hostile Goombas that appear in\u00a0Rogueport\u00a0which can be talked to, including\u00a0Professor Frankly.\u00a0Goombella\u00a0is also the first partner Mario attains. In the\u00a0Trouble Center, there are multiple troubles that involve the Goomba residents of Rogueport.Super Paper Mario  Once again, Goombas appear in\u00a0Super Paper Mario\u00a0serving almost the exact same function as they did in the previous two games. In\u00a0Super Paper Mario,\u00a0Goombas in different Chapters. However, they do not headbonk like they did in the previous games, instead they just walk in a straight line and switch direction if they come into contact with a wall. The only way the Goombas can cause damage to the heroes is if they walk into them, dealing 1 HP worth of damage.\u00a0\"Flip\" variants\u00a0also exist, which have no difference except that when Mario flips, they also flip into 3D and flip back into 2D accordingly.Super Mario Bros. (film)  The Goombas were featured in the Super Mario bros film. They were shown as nine foot tall dinosaur humanoids dressed in red robes and were loyal to King Koopa. Although dangerous, they were simple-minded and easily gullible.Variants  Throughout the game, Mario sees new Goombas with Spiked hats or Goombas that have obtained wings. Later on in the game, new types of Goombas are seen. These new Goombas include Gloombas and Hyper Goombas. Gloombas appear in the large Toad Town Sewers in Paper Mario, and they appear in the Pit of 100 Trials in Super Paper Mario. Hyper Goombas have more health and possess the uncanny ability to power themselves up to 8 attack power. Hyper Goombas reappear in Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door during Chapter 4 and retain the same abilities. Mario has also an ally to a Goomba, called Goombella.Mario Party series  Goomba plays a big role in the Mario Party series as a supporting character. Along with Koopa and Shy Guy, Goomba typically appears as a shop or event attendant on different board maps. Goombas also appear as both common enemies and background characters in mini-games. They also have appeared as hosts of mini-games, and a single Goomba even appears as a host in its own board map in Mario Party 4.Mario Party 1-3  Goombas first appeared in the original Mario Party as a side-character in Peach's Birthday Cake, and also as an enemy in certain mini-games. In Peach's Birthday Cake, Goomba is in charge of the Piranha Plant event that the player can participate in when they land on a happening space. When a player lands on the\u00a0? space, Goomba will ask the player if they would like to plant a Piranha Plant for a thirty coin fee. If they accept the offer, a Piranha Plant will be grown, which would steal a star from a player that lands on that happening. One mini-game that Goomba appeared in was Crazy Cutter, where the player had a chance to cut out an image of Goomba with their jackhammer. When the mini-game was completed successfully, a Goomba would pop out of the ground to signify that the player won. Goomba later appears as a host for the Battle mini-game and Duel Mini-games in Mario Party 2. In this game, he is in charge of taking coins from the players and explaining the battle mini-games. When a player lands on a battle mini-game space, Goomba will\u00a0appear flying with the character's head via a parachute. He will then pick a random amount of coins that the players must donate. After that, he will initiate the battle mini-game. At the end of the mini-game, Goomba will reward the players with coins based on their rankings from the mini-game. He will award additional coins to a random player, depending if there is an odd amount of coins in circulation. Goomba also appears as a host for the Duel Mini-games in Mario Party 2. He would explain the rules of the mini-game for the player, and appear to officiate in the actual duel to officiate the two competitors . The winner of the event will be rewarded by Goomba depending on the amount of coins that were bet. Goomba returns again in Mario Party 3 to reprise his role as the host of the battle mini-games. In this game, the space for the battle mini-game was changed to a Goomba face. Goomba also appears as a partner for Luigi in Duel Mode. Goomba acts as a standard partner in Duel Mode, with a normal punch, low health, and a low salary. Goomba also appears in numerous mini-games like in the previous Mario Party installments. In the mini-game Curtain Call, a Goomba appears as one of the three dancers that dances across the stage. Goomba also appears in the team mini-game Slot Synch, where landing two identical Goomba rewards the players one point. Numerous Goombas can also be seen in the background cheering for the players. Goomba also appears in Game Guy's Roulette, where if a player picks Goomba's slot and successfully land on his sliver, then they will be have their coins multiplied by 8.Mario Party 4-6  Goomba expands his role in the Mario Party series as a host of his own board map, Goomba's Greedy Gala, in Mario Party 4. Goomba Greedy Gala is modeled after a casino and contains many different casino-type games that are hosted by different Goombas. The main feature of the board is the giant roulette in the middle, which determines the path a player is taking by throwing a small ball into a part of the roulette. The color that the player lands on will determine the path that they must take.Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars  Goombas appeared again in Super Mario RPG, as the first normal enemy Mario encounters.Mario Kart series  Goombas appear as obstacles in the track. The Goombas do not appear often in Mario Kart.Variants  Many variants of the Goomba have appeared throughout the years including Paragoombas and Microgoombas. Paragoombas are distinguished by their winged appearance, thus making them more versatile and mobile than typical Goombas. Microgoombas are miniature, parasitic Goombas which latch themselves onto Mario, reducing his jumping ability. Many other types of Goombas have appeared throughout the Mario series, Including short Goombas that appear in Super Mario Galaxy 2, although these largely vary from game to game. Both Goomba and Paragoomba are playable in Mario Superstar Baseball.Friends  Some Goombas act as friendly characters in the Paper Mario series, two (Goombario and Goombella) even joining Mario on his journey. In the Mario Kart series sometimes Goombas carry mushrooms, in Mario Kart: Double Dash!! when a Goomba is \"flattened,\" they drop a Super Mushroom.Royalty  In the video game, Paper Mario, there is a king of the Goombas called the Goomba King who is the first boss of the game. He has two direct underlings named Blue Goomba and Red Goomba and these two are bros. sometimes called the Goomba Bros. After they are defeated they are rocketed hundreds of miles and don't reappear until the ending credits in which the king is stuck in a tree, the Goomba Bros. are running around the tree, hoping he'll fall. The King falls and walks away, angered. In the 1989 television cartoon The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!, Goombas are loyal soldiers in King Koopa's army. They often appear in costumes related to the episode's theme such as zombies or pirates. They were featured in the subsequent spin-offs The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3 and Super Mario World. They also appear in the Super Mario Bros. live-action film, where they were originally inhabitants of Dinohattan who opposed King Koopa's rule, and were de-evolved into large, reptilian monsters as punishment for their disloyalty. Despite having the same name, Goombas in the movie look nothing like the ones in the games. They were portrayed as nine foot tall humanoid dinosaurs with red trench coats and spikes on their shoulders. Although dangerous, they were simple minded and could easily be fooled.Trivia ", "Mario Kart Racing Wiki": "Mario Kart Racing Wiki Main Menu Mario Kart Wii  Mario Kart Wii, styled as MARIOKART Wii and abbreviated as MKWii is a kart racing video game by Nintendo for the Wii console and the sixth game in the Mario Kart series, the fourth for a home console. The game was released on April 10th, 2008 in Japan, April 11th, 2008 in Europe, April 24th, 2008 in Australia, April 27th, 2008 in the US and April 30th, 2009 in South Korea. The game is packaged with the Wii Wheel accessory. It is designed to house the Wii Remote to allow more intuitive and conventional steering. However, it does support the Wii Classic Controller, Nunchuck, and the Nintendo GameCube controller as well. Mario Kart Wii is the second game in the series to support online multiplayer via the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. (Discontinued on May 20, 2014). Via custom unofficial fan-made servers known as \"Wiimmfi\",[1] you can still play online as of December 2017. [2] Nintendo, learning from their mistakes in Mario\u00a0Kart DS, have greatly improved the online multiplayer offering in this game. Unlike past games, Mario Kart Wii supports 12 racers per race and all appear during any mode except Time Trial. The player can also turn off the CPUs when two or more players are present. Mario Kart 8 and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe also support 12 players. Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection was terminated by Nintendo starting on May 20, 2014, making it no longer possible to play this game online without hacking.Mario Kart Wii HD  Mario Kart Wii wasn't released in China back in 2008/2009. However at ChinaJoy exhibition on August 2nd, 2018, Nvidia revealed that Mario Kart Wii would be released on the Nvidia Shield. The new features would be that the game would run at 1080p and would allow for 12 player racing online. Finally, Nintendo will be opening the NFC in China.Gameplay  Mario Kart Wii returns the franchise to single driver gameplay, moving away from the approach of its console predecessor, Mario Kart Double Dash!! on the Nintendo GameCube. Like Mario Kart DS, the game contains sixteen new tracks, while also bringing back sixteen classic tracks. Also, aerial tricks can be preformed by using the Wii remote or other controllers for a speed boost. The Spin Turn technique has also returned from Mario Kart 64. In addition to the karts, Mario Kart Wii introduces bikes in the small, medium, and large groups. Bikes are harder to handle, but they can do wheelies, which gives you a speed boost and an advantage in courses without many sharp turns.Online  Originally from Mario Kart DS, online mode is back using Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. Twelve players can race and battle simultaneously over the internet. This game also introduces the \"VR\" point system, a score that you have based on how many wins or losses you have playing online. One can install a channel on the Wii Menu called the \"Mario Kart Channel.\" This channel allows the player to check rankings for Time Trials and Tournaments as well as race ghosts submitted by other racers through WiiConnect24. However, both WiiConnect24 and Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection ended in April 2014, because of being replaced by Nintendo Network. Now, the only way to use these features again is to download a program called Wiimmfi.Racers  Like the previous games, the characters are established in different weight classes. Instead of \"lightweight\", \"middleweight\", and \"heavyweight\" the classes are dubbed \"Small\", \"Medium\", and \"Large\". This is the only game to have an even amount of characters from each weight class. Small characters have great handling but generally horrible speed; Medium characters have all-around stats; and Large characters have top speeds but mediocre handling and acceleration. The result is a well balanced character offering that leaves each character/kart combination with benefits and drawbacks.Unlockable Characters Miis  Miis are unlockable once the Special Cup on 100cc are beaten (Outfit A only). Their weight varies depending on their height and weight. A second outfit (Outfit B) is unlockable once all\u00a0Expert Staff Ghosts are unlocked. The sizes of Miis can be adjusted in the Mii Channel, which is pre-downloaded on all Wiis. The taller or broader he or she is, the larger the kart or bike he or she can play with. There have also been speculations of a Mii Outfit C; however, if this exists, it likely did not make it past an early stage of the game's development.Statistics  Every character in Mariokart Wii has one (or more) hidden statistic boost(s). Here is a list of every stat boost: Lightweights Weight+3 Handling+2 Weight+3 Speed+2 Speed+1 Weight+2 Acceleration+1 Handling+1 Speed+2 Weight+2 Mini-turbo+1 Acceleration+2 Drift+2 Speed+1 Off-road+2 Handling+1 Mini-turbo+2 Acceleration+1 Drift+1 Mini-turbo+2 Speed+1 Weight+1 Drift+1 Mini-turbo+1 Middleweights Weight+2 Acceleration+1 Handling+1 Drift+1 Speed+1 Weight+2 Speed+1 Acceleration+2 Drift+2 Speed+2 Handling+1 Mini-Turbo+1 Weight+1 Drift+1 Off-road+2 Weight+1 Off-road+1 Mini-Turbo+2 Acceleration+1 Drift+1 Mini-Turbo+2 Speed+1 Off-road+1 Mini-Turbo+1 Speed+1 Weight+1 Off-road+1 Mini-Turbo+1 Heavyweights: Weight+1 Off-road+1 Mini-Turbo+2 Acceleration+2 Drift+2 Off-road+1 Weight+1 Acceleration+1 Handling+1 Mini-Turbo+1 Speed+1 Weight+2 Drift+1 Acceleration+1 Handling+2 Off-road+1 Speed+1 Handling+1 Mini-Turbo+1 Speed+2 Off-road+1\u00a0 Off-road+2 Mini-Turbo+2 Speed+1 Acceleration+1 Handling+1 Drift+1Vehicles Drift Type  In Mario Kart Wii, there are 2 distinct types of drifting: inside (or inward) drifting and outside (or outward) drifting. This greatly affects how the vehicle will handle turns. If a vehicle is outside drifting, then its drift behaves in the usual way, that is upon activating the drift, the vehicle initially swings outwards before curving inwards in a circular path. However inside drifting (which is exclusive to some bikes) behaves rather differently, as when the drift is activated, the bike immediately begins turning inwards, without first swinging outwards. As a result of this, inside drifting bikes can take turns much more tightly, and it is possible to delay the activation of the drift until the last possible moment, enabling the player to take full advantage of the wheelie mechanic. This property is independent of the drift stat however, and inside drifting bikes with low drift stats such as the Spear will still struggle to turn sharp corners. The following bikes are inside drifting: Small Medium LargeTracks  Mario Kart Wii includes a total of 32 racing tracks and 10 battle courses. Both sets are split equally between brand new Nitro content and revived Retro tracks. An additional new battle course was exclusive to Nintendo tournaments.Nitro tracks  In Mario Kart 8, The Legend of Zelda DLC or Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is required.Battle courses  There are two ways to play Battle (Balloon Battle and Coin Runners), and there are 10 stages to battle on. 5 are new stages, and the other 5 are retro stages. In addition to these, Galaxy Colosseum was exclusive to Nintendo tournaments. Using a modified Wii with the Gecko cheat engine, the course can be enabled in racing mode, replacing Mushroom Gorge.Items  Classic items from previous installments return as well as three new items.Obstacles and Hazards  Mario Kart Wii has obstacles in almost every course which are:Glitches  Mario Kart Wii is known for its many glitches. Here's a list of all the tracks with glitches, and an explanation with them:External Links Trivia! Banana  The Banana (also known as the Banana Peel) is arguably the most common item in the Mario Kart series. These slippery items cause a vehicle to spin-out! While easily dismissed as being the least effective item in Mario Kart, the Banana Peel is not to be underestimated completely, as it is also the most versatile item in the right hands. If placed well, a single Banana can cause an unfortunate racer to fall straight off the track, and if thrown ahead from just the right distance, and at just the right angle, they can make for an unexpected, and almost unavoidable attack. Even just one Banana can decide whether you're in 1st place or 2nd place!Uses  A Banana can be used as an offensive or defensive Item. A player can throw a Banana out in front of their\u00a0kart to try to trip up the racer in front of them. They can also be deployed behind the kart, so the driver behind you will be greeted by a deadly smiling Banana and spin out.\u00a0 For defense, a Banana can also be deployed and suspended behind the kart (This feature is not present in Super Mario Kart). The Banana now acts as a shield against other Items such as a Red Shell or a Green Shell. Also, they can act as a barrier against opponents who try to knock you off the edge. In Mario Kart 8, Triple Bananas circle around the racer, so they can be used by running into an enemy racer, making them spin out.Variations Giant Banana  There is also a larger variant exclusive to Mario Kart: Double Dash!! called the Giant Banana. When a driver hits a Giant Banana, the fruit will split into three normal Bananas. This gigantic special item can only be used by Donkey Kong, Diddy Kong, King Boo and Petey Piranha, who are able to use any special item.Banana Bunch  The Banana Bunch is an item exclusive to Mario Kart 64. It is a row of five Bananas that trail the user's kart. Hitting another racer with the trail causes all the Bananas to drop. This is one of the few normal items that have only appeared in one incarnation; a Triple Banana variant took its place in Mario Kart DS and onward, with the only exception being Mario Kart: Double Dash!!.Triple Banana  The Triple Banana serves as a replacement for the Banana Bunch, instead of being a row of five bananas, it's now a row of three bananas. It also appears in Mario Kart: Double Dash!!, but only when a Giant Banana is touched. It appears in Mario Kart DS, Mario Kart Wii, Mario Kart 7, Mario Kart 8, and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.Trivia! Spiny Shell  A Spiny Shell (\u30c8\u30b2\u30be\u30fc\u3053\u3046\u3089), also sometimes referred to as a Blue Shell (\u9752\u3053\u3046\u3089), is an absolutely devastating Item that debuted in the second Mario Kart title, Mario Kart 64. Although the Blue Shell has taken on many different forms and variations throughout the series, its main objective has always remained the same: to utterly obliterate the frontrunner in the race. Because of its cruel and unforgiving nature, the Blue Shell has become an infamous Item, feared by even most skilled kart-racers. So far, the Spiny Shell has been featured in every game since Mario Kart 64, causing huge amounts of chaos, unfairness, and fun.Usage Mario Kart 64  In its first appearance, the Spiny Shell is just a blue variant of the more common red Spiny Shell in previous Mario games. Any racer besides first place can obtain it, but it's by far the rarest Item in the game. Once obtained from an Item Box and fired, the spiky shell travels in a straight path for a few moments. And much like a Red Shell, if the Spiny Shell hits a wall, it's gone for good (although it has better corner-careening powers than the Red Shell). After this, the shell locks on to the first place racer, traveling in the middle of the road and bowling over any racers in its path. Any gaps in the track aren't a problem for the Blue Shell; they can simply glide right over them. Once the first place racer hears the dreaded siren sound, it's already too late... they're knocked over in a violent crash. Additionally, this early variant has the option of being dragged behind a player's vehicle, much like a Banana or Green Shell. Utilizing the Blue Shell in this way creates an almost impenetrable defense, as the shell can never be broken by racers or any Item besides a Starman.Mario Kart: Super Circuit  By far the weakest version of the Spiny Shell appears in Mario Kart: Super Circuit. This Blue Shell (now slightly darker) acts very much the same as the Mario Kart 64 version, but it can't fly over gaps or holes like the other one. This is a serious deficiency in the effectiveness of the weapon, as many tracks have open areas in them. It's one of the reasons why first place racers rarely have to worry about them in this game. In addition, even if a Spiny Shell connects with a racer, the damage done is only slightly better than a normal shell. Luckily, the Blue Shell can still be dragged behind vehicles in this game, and they still are nearly unbreakable when in this configuration. Also, very similar to the Red Shell in this game, a Blue Shell can be shot backwards to remain in place on the track. Once the first place racer comes near it on the next lap, it will immediately home in on them. This strategy works very well, as it's almost a guaranteed hit every time as opposed to forward throwing. However, it will only work if there's one more lap.Mario Kart: Double Dash!!  Mario Kart: Double Dash!! greatly increased the power of the Spiny Shell from the last game. This is the first version to have wings, which make it fly in the air. Now, although this means that racers 2nd-8th are all clear, it also means that the Blue Shell now has outstanding speed, and 1st place reaction times or strategies are cut very short. It's also the first one to be hexagonally separated on the blue carapace, which continues from here forth. Once launched (by only 4th-7th place), the shell will hiss through the air, skipping over all gaps and obstacles (which means that hitting a wall isn't a problem for it anymore). And once it reaches lead driver, they're about to have a real bad day... after hovering over them for a second, it dives down on them, causing a cataclysmic explosion that throws up their vehicle (and as a bonus, anyone else near them) into the air. This causes massive amounts of lost time. Although the ability to drag or shoot the Blue Shell from the back has been lost, it also has a new feature that allows it to go after the highest place racer that hasn't crossed the line yet. So, if 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place have already finished, 4th place will be targeted. This ability will remain with every Spiny Shell version afterwards.Mario Kart DS  Because of the effectiveness of the previous Spiny Shell, Mario Kart DS does not add or take away anything from the Mario Kart: Double Dash!! version. It still is very rare and can only be gotten in 4th to 7th place.Mario Kart Wii  Again, not much at all has changed with the Mario Kart Wii edition of the Blue Shell. Now the player count is up to twelve, 4th through 8th place can obtain the shell. New to this game, the Spiny Shell now is available for use in Battle Mode, targeting the leading opposing team member with the most Balloons or most Coins. However, the rarity of the Item is greatly increased, as it only appears when there's a huge difference in team scores. In addition, since friendly Items can not hit friendly racers in VS (or Battle Mode), a player in first can throw a Blue Shell to hit the highest-positioned member of the opposition.Mario Kart 7  The Spiny Shell heads back down to the ground in Mario Kart 7, ditching its wings, but barely any of its speed. This means that racers not in first once again have to fear about getting knocked over by it. However, once the Blue Shell reaches 1st, it will rise from the ground, hovering from a bit, and then rock them with an explosion. Instead of being tossed up into the air like the previous three versions, the unfortunate soul will roll sideways, potentially falling off the track. Racers who are so far ahead (or are just lucky enough to be missed) don't have to worry; this version of the Spiny Shell only has a set range. Although the range is still extremely high and almost always unavoidable, if it goes past it, it will disappear.Mario Kart 8  In Mario Kart 8, the Spiny Shell, slightly lighter in color, is almost identical to the previous Mario Kart 7 version. It's only slightly faster, but the main difference is that the explosion only stops players dead in their tracks... they don't have to worry about being tossed to the side anymore. Also, because of the new Item system, any racer besides 1st can obtain the Blue Shell. It just depends how close/far away they are from the leader.Mario Kart 8 Deluxe  Everything about the Spiny Shell in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is exactly the same as in the previous game, since this is just a report for the Nintendo Switch.Trivia! Mario Kart 7  Mario Kart 7 (styled as MARIOKART7 and commonly abbreviated as MK7) is a Mario based racing game exclusively made for the Nintendo 3DS (can be played on 2DS though). It is the seventh Mario Kart game in the series, (ninth including the arcade games) and the third for a handheld console. Returning from Mario Kart Wii, players are able to exchange Ghost Data and play online or wirelessly on multiplayer mode. Mario Kart 7 introduces a few new features to the tracks, including Blue Boosters (which trigger Gliding sections) and underwater turbines specifically made for underwater racing. This game introduces kart customization as well, allowing players to toggle parts on their karts to fit their preferences.Gameplay New Features  * Exclusive to this game.Returning Features Removed Features Characters Tracks and courses  Just like it's predecessors, Mario Kart DS and Mario Kart Wii, Mario Kart 7 has 8 Cups and 32 courses: 16 new tracks and 16 remakes from previous games' tracks. Italics denote course name in PAL version.Nitro tracks  Mario Kart 8, Animal Crossing DLC or Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is required.Grand Prix Points System  In Grand Prix, the player selects an Engine Class and a cup to race. Each cup, as shown above, contains four courses that are played in order. After each individual race, the place in which the racer comes is translated into a number of points to go to the racer's total. At the end of the cup, the points are cumulatively tallied, and whichever racer has the most, second most, and third most points wins a gold, silver, or bronze trophy, respectively. Below is a table showing the amount of points garnered for coming in a certain place in a race.Trivia! External links Rainbow Road  This article can refer to two or more different things. If you were linked here from an article, please change the link on the article to the appropriate page.Karts  Karts are the vehicles that give the Mario Kart series the second half of its name. They are what the Characters traverse throughout the track with. Characters from Super Mario Kart to Mario Kart: Super Circuit had default Karts to use, although, they differed in terms of the racer being either Light, Medium, or Heavy. Since Mario Kart: Double Dash!!, Characters could choose their Karts, which now, in the newer Mario Kart games, have statistics.Mario Kart DS  Mario Kart DS\u00a0(styled as MARIOKART DS and abbreviated to MKDS), is a Nintendo DS racing game developed and published by Nintendo. It is the fifth installment in the Mario Kart series and the first to use Nintendo's free online service, Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection\u00a0(now discontinued). The game was released in 2005. It was well received critically, scoring an average of 91% from Metacritic. Many reviewers have called it the best Mario Kart game in the series. Like other games in the Mario Kart series, Mario Kart DS involves various characters from various Mario games racing each other in go-karts on tracks themed from locations in the Mario series, less realistic physics, and the use of various weapons and or items to achieve victory differentiates kart racing games like Mario Kart DS from more realistic racing games. \u00a0For US, Europe, Australia, and Japan it released in 2005, apparently, if you live in Korea, you had to wait until 2007.Gameplay  In Grand Prix mode, the player competes against seven computer-controlled racers. There are two types of Grand Prix in Mario Kart DS, each consisting of four cups, and each cup consisting of four race tracks. Nitro GP contains sixteen brand new tracks while Retro GP contains sixteen tracks converted from previous entries in the Mario Kart series. There are three engine classes which serve as difficulty levels for the Grand Prix mode: 50cc, 100cc, and 150cc. The higher the engine class, the faster all the karts go. A 150cc Mirror Mode is also an unlockable, in which all the 150cc tracks are flipped horizontally as if seeing the game in a mirror. Another staple of past Mario Kart games, Battle Mode, also makes a return. Battle modes include Balloon Battle, in which you try to pop everyone else's balloons by attacking them or steal them with mushrooms and eliminate them, or Shine Runners, in which you try to collect the most Shine Sprites. Eventually, players with the least amount of Shine Sprites will be eliminated from the game. Items also appear in the DS sequel. There are old items such as Bananas and Green Shells. There are also new Items such as Blooper and Bullet Bill. In the new Mission Mode, players control a specific character in that character's standard kart and must perform eight individual missions, whose objectives range from collecting coins to attacking enemies. Players are then ranked based on their performance, and given either an E, D, C, B, A, or one to three stars if the task is completed by a certain time. In order to advance to the next level, players must complete a \"boss\" task, which is unlocked after all eight of a level's missions are completed. Completing all missions in level 1 through 6 with at least a 1-star rating on each mission opens up a secret 7th level with more challenging missions to complete. It should be noted that there are no missions where one of the unlockable characters is playable. In Time Trial Mode, players try to finish a course in a short time as possible. While racing, the top screen of the Nintendo DS displays a third-person perspective behind and slightly above the player's vehicle. The bottom screen lists the current race standings, items carried by each player, and a map of the course. The map can be toggled to show an overall view of the entire course or a close-up view of the racer's immediate vicinity. The close-up view is very detailed, showing nearby racer positions, course hazards, item boxes, and even incoming attacks. Each playable character starts out with two karts: one special kart unique to that character, and a standard kart resembling a real go-kart. These karts have slightly different stats, although their general strengths and weaknesses are the same. As a player progresses through the game, he or she can unlock a third special kart for each character, also with slightly different stats. Ultimately, the player can unlock the ability to use any of the 36 total karts with any character. When a player is selecting their kart for a race, the game lists the kart's max speed, acceleration, weight, handling, drifting ability, and the quality of items the kart is likely to receive. Each course features numerous item boxes that players can drive through to receive a randomly selected item. Whichever item the player receives is generally dependent upon their current position in the race and, to a lesser extent, the item stat of the player's kart; Players near the front will tend to receive rear-attack items, while players trailing in the back of the race will tend to receive more powerful items. Most attack items can be targeted forwards or backward by holding the appropriate direction on the D-pad when using the item against other. New items like Bullet Bill transformation have also been added in the game. Mini-Turbos, a feature first introduced in Mario Kart: Double Dash!!, returns in Mario Kart DS. Mini-Turbos are momentary speed boosts that can be obtained while drifting. Also featured in Mario Kart DS and not to be confused with drifting is the ability to draft behind an opponent's kart. If the player is close enough, white streaks will start flying by their kart, and their speed will begin to increase. If the player maintains this position long enough, they will receive a noticeable speed boost, allowing them to easily overtake and pass the opponent, which is called drafting. The Rocket Start technique for starting a race also returns for this installment, but with a small change: players can now hold the acceleration button when the countdown timer shows 2. Using a simple drawing program interface, a player can create a customized emblem. During the race, each player's emblem appears as a decal on their kart, and in multi-player matches, opponents can see the player's name and emblem prominently overlaid above their kart's position on the opponent's screen. The player's emblem is also, on Wi-Fi play, shown to their opponents once the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection has found opponents and initiated a match.Wi-Fi Multiplayer  This normally includes only 20 racing tracks and only the VS. racing mode. There is an eight-player limit and has modes such as VS., Balloon Battle, and Shine Runners. When choosing players, you are restricted to 8 characters (Mario, Luigi, Peach, Yoshi, Toad, Donkey Kong, Wario, and Bowser).Multi-Card Multiplayer  If each member of a group has a Nintendo DS and a copy of Mario Kart DS, it is possible to race in Multi-Card mode. All of the game's characters and tracks are available, and Battle mode can be selected for multiplayer. With the Mario Kart DS demo available from Volume 1 of DS Download Station, only Multi-Card Multiplayer mode is available. Although no physical game is used, each player must download the demo from the Station. Once this is finished, VS. mode can be accessed for play on the Figure-8 Circuit track and SNES Mario Circuit 1 track. Only differently-colored Shy Guys are available as characters, some which will be controlled by the computer for games with less than eight players.Single-Card Multiplayer  Single-Card Multiplayer mode allows racing for up to eight players with one DS-compatible console per player and only one copy of Mario Kart DS. The first player selects the game's Multiplayer mode, while the others select \"DS Download Play\" on their handheld. Only eight tracks are available in this mode: those of the Mushroom Cup and those of the retro Shell Cup. All players are differently-colored Shy Guys.Racers  There are 13 characters in Mario Kart DS, ten are from previous Mario Kart games and three of them are new to the series, which are Dry Bones, Shy Guy, and R.O.B. However, Shy Guy is not directly playable, and you can only play as him by doing a simple multiplayer match and downloading off someone else using Download Play. Shy Guy is also the only CPU player in the Mario Kart Nintendo DS Download Kiosk demo, available from version 1 of the USA kiosk, however, the player will race against seven differently colored Shy Guys at once in the single-player mode.Default racers Unlockable racers Download Play Only racers Tracks  This is the second game in the Mario Kart series to return previous tracks in addition to never-before-seen tracks, the first game being Mario Kart: Super Circuit which featured all 20 tracks from Super Mario Kart. indicates a track or course available in all multiplayer modes, including single-card mode. indicates a track unavailable in the now-discontinued Nintendo WFC mode.Battle courses  In single-card mode, battle courses are selected at random instead of displaying the course selection screen.Items Beta Elements  This is a list of beta elements in Mario Kart DS.Items  The Chain Chomp and the Bowser Shell from Mario Kart: Double Dash!! were supposed to appear in the game (like in the kiosk demo) but they were removed because they were too powerful. However, these items still remain in the game's coding, and if you use the Chain Chomp or the Bowser Shell, the game will crash.Courses Karts  Yoshi and Wario have two unused karts. Wario's car was blue with a yellow mustache. Yoshi's looks like the Egg 1, but it's pink. It is called the Egg 2.Characters  Professor E. Gadd, Birdo, Toadette, and Koopa Troopa were all planned to appear as unlockable playable characters but were removed at some point for unknown reasons and were presumably replaced by Dry Bones, Daisy, Waluigi, and R.O.B.Karts  There are thirty-six karts in Mario Kart DS. They are classified based on six stats which are:Kart List  Each character has three karts, two of which are available from the start.Obstacles and Hazards  Mario Kart DS has obstacles in almost every course which are:Emblems  This is the newest feature of the game. This only appears in this game. An emblem is a decal or picture that appears as a sort of symbol for someone on their kart. The emblem appears only on certain places on a kart, and depending on where it is put, the emblem may be smaller, bigger and/or stretched out. The player also has the ability to choose from various patterns ranging from a Starman to Thunderbolt and also the shape of Mario's face. The player also can choose not to use a custom emblem and to use an original emblem already designed for the character. The player might do this if he/she has an unfinished emblem that they don't want others to see. Emblems are displayed during VS matches and in online matches on the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.Tie-ins With Other Games Critic Reviews  Scores received in the major gaming review sites:Trivia! External Links Mario Kart: Double Dash!!  Mario Kart: Double Dash!! (styled as MARIOKART Double Dash!! and abbreviated to MKDD) is a racing video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo GameCube. It is the fourth game in the Mario Kart series.Gameplay  Double Dash!!'s gameplay vastly differs from and improves on its predecessors in many ways; since the player can pick not one character, but two - one to drive, and one to use items. In addition, the player is able to use karts that are not the characters' (Mario and Luigi can use Yoshi's kart, for example) depending on their class, whether they are heavyweight, middleweight, or lightweight. Not only this, the power slide has been improved; if the player makes blue sparks while power sliding, a mini turbo is performed. The rocket start is also improved as the Double Dash!!, in which both team members perform it when the Pre-race countdown is finished. There are sixteen courses to race on. Each cup features four tracks. Five different cup races are available, one of which is the All Cup Tour, featuring all sixteen tracks in random order (except for the first, Luigi Circuit, and the last, Rainbow Road). Each track is also playable in \"Mirror Mode,\" where the tracks are mirrored; however, Mirror Mode is only available for 150cc. This installment also features multiplayer battle modes. As in previous installments, the battle arenas are enclosed, with varying architecture and a constant arsenal. In addition to the balloon-popping game, which has been the standard Mario Kart battle game, two new battle systems are included. The first, called \"Shine Thief\", involves capturing a Shine Sprite and maintaining possession of it for a set time period. The second, called \"Bob-omb Blast\", uses only colored Bob-ombs, and utilizes a trade-off point system that requires the players to succeed in attacks, while also avoiding those directed at them. Both battle modes have returned in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Aside from the many drivers available, numerous other Mario characters play minor roles in the game. Lakitu reprises his role as the referee, signaling the start of each race, alerting players when they complete a lap, warning them when they are going the wrong way, and returning drivers to the racetrack when they fall into dangerous areas. Shy Guys, Piranha Plants, Goombas, and Wigglers are also present in the game and serve as obstacles for the driver to avoid. Toadsworth drives the winners of a cup during the victory celebration. Piantas and Nokis from Super Mario Sunshine also cheer players on certain courses, such as Peach Beach and Daisy Cruiser, and form much of the crowd at victory ceremonies (held at Peach Beach). Classic Mario series characters, including Donkey Kong Jr., can be seen in the crowds around Waluigi Stadium. The game includes 21 karts to choose from. They are categorized by weight. Generally, lightweight karts have good acceleration and handling and are easily able to traverse rough terrain, but have low top speeds, can be knocked around by larger karts, and can only hold light characters. Heavyweight karts usually have high top speeds, can knock around many smaller karts, but they have poor acceleration, steering, off-road handling, and can only be manned if there is at least one heavy character. Middleweight karts' performance are well-balanced, but they cannot hold heavy characters. However, there are exceptions to this, such as the Barrel Train and Boo Pipes. Of 21 karts available in all, only eight are available from the start. The other 13 may be unlocked by successfully completing races and finishing the game. Although everyone has one kart, the twenty-first kart is the Parade Kart that Toadsworth uses to drive the first place winners. This kart the best stat ratio (4 stars for speed and weight; 3 stars for acceleration) and any combination of characters can drive it, but it takes the longest to recover from flipping over. A notable attribute of Double Dash!! is that it allows LAN play using the GameCube broadband adapter. Up to eight GameCubes can be connected, allowing for 16 player multiplayer games (two players controlling each kart).Items Special Items  Every character has their own special item. Different combinations means a wide variety of items. For example, if someone were to play as Toadette, another player were to play as Baby Mario/Luigi and they controlled the kart together, they would be able to get Golden Mushrooms and the Chain Chomp occasionally.Unlocking Criteria  Almost all cups in the game will unlock something new once the player completes it. Here is a list:Trivia! External Links Racers  In the Mario Kart series, a wide selection of Racers are available to choose from. Although there was only eight in the first game, Super Mario Kart, the number of characters has increased throughout the series. Cool new racers are added to almost every installment after Super Mario Kart, and some are not included later on in the series. The Mario series isn't the whole contributor to the lineup of racers, although it does offer a lot of them (because it is MARIO Kart, of course!). Racers can range from the DK series, the Animal Crossing series, the Pac-Man series, and even the Tamagotchi series! Racers are grouped into three different classes: Light, Medium, and Heavy. Each class boasts several advantages and disadvantages, and their performance on the track reflects their capabilities.Kart  A kart is a vehicle used in the Mario Kart series for racing. They come in many varieties. Karts first appeared in the game Super Mario Kart; they've since reappeared in every following incarnation. Mario Kart: Double Dash!! moved away from the uniform template used by all karts and introduced custom karts for each character and a simple kart stat system. Mario Kart DS expanded on the stat system, which is also slightly expanded in Mario Kart Wii. In Mario Kart DS, all karts have about even stats (depending on the character's weight, the weight changes) with the occasional high or low. Each character has three karts, making for a total of 36. In Mario Kart Wii, there are 6 karts for each weight class, making for a total of 18. The term Kart has another meaning in Super Mario Kart, in which Karts replaced the term of Extra Lives in Grand Prix mode. When a driver only reached the fifth position or below, he would lose one of his four Karts. Losing the last Kart would quit the Grand Prix. However, it is possible to get one back under certain circumstances. A Kart also appeared in Super Smash Bros. Melee as a trophy. Here is a list of the karts, arranged by game. (Note: Super Mario Kart, Mario Kart 64, and Mario Kart Super Circuit all feature a basic, metal pipe frame kart for each character. The way they perform is different for each.)Super Mario Kart Mario Kart 64 Mario Kart: Super Circuit Mario Kart: Double Dash!! Mario Kart DS Mario Luigi Peach Yoshi Toad Donkey Kong Wario Bowser Daisy Dry Bones Waluigi R.O.B. Mario Kart Wii Lightweight Mediumweight Heavyweight Mario Kart 7 Mario Kart 8 Mario Kart 8 Deluxe  All Karts from Mario Kart 8 reappeared here, and there is one returning kart.See Also Rosalina  Rosalina (\u30ed\u30bc\u30c3\u30bf), protector of the cosmos, makes her first playable appearance in Mario Kart Wii in April 2008, a few\u00a0months after Super Mario Galaxy came out, where she is a heavyweight unlockable character. Rosalina rides in large karts, and is the first and only female character to ever be in this class. While racing, a Luma orbits around Rosalina. Rosalina's racing symbol is a Grand Star. Rosalina is the Staff Ghost character for Rainbow Road. Rosalina is also playable in Mario Kart 7, where she is an unlockable medium-large \"Cruiser\"-type character. She also has her own course in the game, named Rosalina's Ice World. She returned in Mario Kart 8.Characteristics  Rosalina is a tall character, taller than both Peach and Mario, with\u00a0looks similar to Peach. However her overall appearance is sharper; her skin is paler than Peach, her eyes are a lighter shade of blue, and her hair is a much lighter blonde than Peach. She wears purple nail polish, and has a large bang which covers her right eye.\u00a0 Rosalina wears a long sleeved, flowing turquoise-colored dress. Like Peach, she wears a brooch located on her chest, but it's star-shaped and\u00a0silver, with\u00a0a yellow circle in the middle. She also wears a silver crown with red and blue gems, yellow star-shaped earrings and silver high heels. The collar of her gown cuts off at her brooch, with a powder blue flap that loops around it, and has long sleeves with a wide opening at the end, also topped with powder blue frills. At the bottom of her dress is another frill which loops around the dress's end until turning up on a point at the middle; under it a white skirt is visible. In Super Mario Galaxy she carries a silver wand with a hollow yellow star at the end. Also in Super Smash Bros for the Wii U and 3DS, the bottom of her dress is glittered with star patterns, and her high heels are light green instead of silver. Like\u00a0Peach and Daisy, Rosalina wears a jumpsuit when she is driving bikes in Mario Kart Wii and Mario Kart 8. The outfit is white and has an outline which is the same color of her dress. Her gloves and boots' color are also the same as her dress. She wears a teal scarf, and keeps her star-shaped brooch at her chest. She alao has a teal heart at the back of her outfit. Exclusive to Mario Kart Wii only, a yellow Luma orbits around her when she's racing, and makes small sounds when she does\u00a0a trick. This was probably taken out due to the 3ds\u2019s graphic limitations. She is the only female to be in the heavy weight class. \u00a0Appearances in Mario Kart games How to Unlock Mario Kart Wii Mario Kart 7 Mario Kart 8 Staff Ghost Tracks Boo  A Boo, a haunting enemy in the Mario series, makes its appearance in Mario Kart series as an item, first in Super Mario Kart, and then in Mario Kart 64, Mario Kart: Super Circuit, Mario Kart DS, and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. The Item is also in the arcade games Mario Kart Arcade GP and Mario Kart Arcade GP 2. Boos are also harmless (but still scary) characters that fly around in courses such as Ghost Valley 1, Ghost Valley 2, Ghost Valley 3, and Banshee Boardwalk. However, they are dangerous on the track, Broken Pier in Mario Kart: Super Circuit, because running into one will cause one to grab onto you and make you lose speed and Coins. The Boo item temporarily left the Mario Kart series for 12 years, and then came back to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.Uses  A Boo, probably the sneakiest Item in Mario Kart, temporarily turns the racer who is using it completely invisible to all other opponents. The player him/herself sees their Kart turn into a ghost, similar to the ones in Time Trials. While invisible, the racer can't be hit by any Items whatsoever, and they are also not hindered by driving off-road. However, they still slow down when they crash into walls (Sorry guys, no passing through walls. That'd be, like, cheating.) and you can drive off the track. But still, it is extremely convenient for cutting corners and avoiding incoming Items, making a Boo a great recovery and defensive Item. In addition to invisibility, a Boo will go and fly off to another racer who has an Item. They can steal it, and then fly back to it and bring it to you (yeah, stealing is perfectly legal in Mario Kart)! It could be anything from a Star (great Item) or a Green Shell (an OK Item)-it just depends on whatever the other opponent has. In all games except for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, it will steal the strongest item in play, and in Super Mario Kart, the steal will work even if the opponent's Item Roulette has not yet stopped. If no one has anything, well.. too bad. No Item for you! But don't worry, Boo will still come back to say goodbye. It just won't deposit anything in your Item inventory. In Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Boo will steal from the main item slot of a random racer who is ahead of the user, and place it in the user's reserve slot. Fire Flowers, Boomerang Flowers, Golden Dash Mushrooms and Triple items will be fully restored as if the player had just got them from the Item Box. It will not steal Piranha Plants or Bullet Bills that are currently in use, nor will it steal Crazy 8s. It also will not steal other Boos, as it is impossible to have more than one in play at a time. If there is nothing to steal, he will give the user a free Mushroom. The invisibility no longer prevents slowdown from driving off-road.Mario Kart: Super Circuit  Finally, exclusive to Mario Kart: Super Circuit, a Boo will do all the things mentioned above, but it\u00a0also is a nice attack Item as it will fly over to the first place racer and latch on to them, slowing them down and stealing your Coins (similar to the Shy Guys on Sunset Wilds in the same game). Too bad for the first place driver, being haunted and all.Trivia! Mario Kart 64  Mario Kart 64 (styled as MARIOKART 64 abbreviated to MK64) is a racing game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64 video game console. It was released in 1996 in Japan and 1997 for the rest of the world. It is the sequel to Super Mario Kart, and features a move to 3D computer graphics and the inclusion of four-player support. Players take control of characters from the Mario universe, who race around a variety of tracks with items that can either harm an opponent or aid the user. The move to three dimensional graphics allowed for track features not possible with the original game's Mode 7 graphics, such as changes in elevation, bridges, walls and pits. However, the characters and items remained 2D pre-rendered sprites. The introduction music for Mario Kart 64 is loosely based on the original Super Mario Kart theme tune. The game is compatible with the N64 Controller Pak, but only to save track ghosts in the Time Trial mode. All other data is stored in-cartridge. This was re-released on the Wii's Virtual Console, but it cannot be played with the Wii Remote. This is the second Mario Kart game in the series.Gameplay  Players choose from a roster of eight characters that vary in weight, speed, and acceleration. These characters race in a variety of tracks based upon different locations in the Mario world. Each track has a unique shape, and can contain various obstacles, hazards, and short cuts. Eight characters participate in each race. Up to four of them can be human characters, while the rest are computer controlled (for one to two players only). Three and four player races have no computer controlled racers. On a track, various actions can be performed to change the flow of a race. Items can be acquired by hitting an item box, a rainbow-colored box with a spinning question mark. The items' uses include acting as projectiles to impede the opponent, speed up the user, or stop opponents through other means. One can earn a small turbo boost by drifting, which one can perform by hopping and tilting the control stick back and forth three times. However, AI-controlled racers do not use any kind of shell. There are various modes of play such as the Mario Grand Prix where one or two human players compete with computer players in a group of eight around a series of four courses per cup - Mushroom Cup, Flower Cup, Star Cup, and Special Cup respectively. A player selects one of the four cups at the beginning of the game as well as a difficulty level, measured by engine size (50cc, 100cc, or 150cc). After a gold trophy has been acquired for each cup on the 150cc level, the Extra difficulty level is playable, where the tracks are mirrored. The player can also race on a track alone while recording a time (Time Trial mode), and trying to beat this time on subsequent races. There are two modes where players can face each other. The VS. mode allows you to race with each other, and Bob-ombs are thrown in each track. The Battle Mode allows players to compete in one of four special arenas filled with item boxes; each player has three balloons attached to their kart which are lost if any damage is done to the kart, with the winner being the last remaining player. If three or four players are participating, then the first one or two players\u00a0without balloons\u00a0transform into bombs on wheels that can crash into the remaining karts. One of the major flaws of the gameplay revolves around the computer \"cheating\". When hit with weapons, the computer characters can stop for half a second and then continue at full speed. This is possible in Mario Kart Wii when you are a player. This is at odds with a player controlled character being thrown into the air and coming to a complete stop. Also, the computer can seem to catch up with the player controlled character, regardless of the lead the player has developed (especially when said player is not drifting).Racers  Mario Kart 64 has eight drivers from which the players can choose. Koopa Troopa and Donkey Kong Junior, both of whom appeared in Super Mario Kart, did not return for Mario Kart 64, and were replaced by Donkey Kong and Wario. In pre-release screenshots, a Magikoopa was playable, but before the game's final release the Magikoopa was replaced by Donkey Kong. The racers from the lightest to the heaviest are: Toad, Yoshi, Peach, Luigi, Mario, Wario, Bowser, and Donkey Kong. Unlike the other Mario Kart games, the racers of a lighter weight class have higher top speeds just like their acceleration. However, lighter weight racers are more prone to spinning out in collision with heavier weight racers, and can lose a balloon in Battle Mode from that collision.Production Credits  Executive Producer - Hiroshi Yamauchi Producer - Shigeru Miyamoto Director - Hideki Konno Assistant Director - Yasuyuki Oyagi Programmers - Masato Kimura, Kenji Yamamoto, Yasuhiro Kawaguchi, Yuzuru Ogawa, Masahiro Kawano, Hirohito Yoshimoto Demo Sequence Programmer - Hajime Yajima, Takumi Kawagoe Visual Director - Tadashi Sugiyama CG Character Designers - Tomoaki Kuroume, Hiroaki Takenaka, Tokihiko Toyoda, Shigefumi Hino, Masanao Arimoto, Hisashi Nogami CG Map Designers - Makoto Miyanaga, Naoki Mori, Hiroyasu Kuwabara Music Composer - Kenta Nagata Sound Programmers - Taro Bando, Yoji Inagaki Japanese Sampling Voices - Asako Kozuki, Tomoko Maruno, Charles Martinet,Julien Bardakoff, Thomas Spindler, John Hulaton English Sampling Voices - Charles Martinet, Leslie Swan, Isaac Marshall Technical Support - Takao Sawano, Tsuyoshi Takahashi, Hirohito Yada Progress Management - Kimiyoshi Fukui, Keizo Kato Special Thanks to - Yasuhito Sakai, Yoshitaka Nishikawa, Hideki Fujii, Yusuke Nakano, Wataru Yamaguchi, Phil Sandhop, Super Mario Club Donkey Kong 3-D Model provided by Rare U.K.Trivia! Dry Bowser  Dry Bowser is a skeletal form of his living counterpart, Bowser. Dry Bowser originally appeared as the World 8 Boss in New Super Mario Bros. In that game, Dry Bowser is simply a skeletal form of Bowser. In the Mario Kart series, however, Dry Bowser is an entirely separate entity. Dry Bowser makes his first appearance as a Large playable character in Mario Kart Wii as an unlockable character. He reappeared in the\u00a0Animal Crossing DLC pack for\u00a0Mario Kart 8 and in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, he is now a default character, the first time in the Mario Kart series.Characteristics  Dry Bowser is the skeleton version of\u00a0Bowser, as you might have guessed from looking at the picture of him above. He is reminiscent to\u00a0Dry Bones, who is the skeletal counterpart of\u00a0Koopa Troopa. Dry Bowser's legs are made out of a lot of small little bones. \u00a0His arms are a little less detailed, but still have the same deadly white-gray shade of the rest of his ghastly body. His rib cage is visible, and Dry Bowser's shell has turned a dark, black color. His tail, along with his feet, hands and shell, are still covered in deadly claws. His bands around his arms, wrists, and neck are now a maroon color, and they too are covered in sharp, spiney spikes. His face is still in the same shape as classic\u00a0Bowser, but it too has been burned to only a skull. He has jagged teeth, and threatening black eyes with small, yellow pupils. Dry Bowser has horns sticking out of his head, and even though his skin been singed off, his flowing, red hair remains intact. Also, he got tired of his old hairstyle, so he decided to change it up and now wears his mane in a ponytail (similar to Bowser Jr.). His roar is now a rasping, hoarse growl. You wouldn't have much of a voice either if your vocal cords were exposed to red-hot lava.Unlocking Karts and Bikes Staff Ghost Tracks  * - Retro trackTrivia! Toad  Toad is Princess Peach's loyal attendant, and he has appeared in all of the Mario Kart games up to date. Similar to Toadette, Toad is a lightweight driver in every game and therefore quick off the mark. His karts usually have an extra kick to their drift, allowing him to swerve past sharp turns with ease. To unlock him in Mario Kart: Double Dash!!, win the 100cc Special Cup. His special item (which he shares with Toadette) in that game is the Golden Mushroom (which was then known as the Super Mushroom). Toad is the brother of Toadette (confirmed in the Mario Kart Wii guidebook only), and he is a good friend of Mario, Luigi, Peach, Daisy, and Yoshi. Like the other heroes, Toad views Bowser as an enemy. Toad has many colors, and they are only spectators.Characteristics  Toad is a small little guy in the Mario series. He has a white mushroom hat with big red dots on it on top of his head. This is because he is from Mushroom Kingdom. Despite having an appearance similar to many other Toads from the Mushroom Kingdom, he is often referred to as a close buddy of Mario's and is seen to being a loyal friend to those he's friends with. He has big brown shoes and a blue vest. Also, he has a happy, memorable face.Vehicles Staff Ghost Tracks  * - Retro trackAppearances Trivia! Princess Peach  Originally referred to as simply Princess or Princess Toadstool in Super Mario Kart, Princess Peach Toadstool is a playable character in all twelve of the Mario Kart installments. Peach is the love-interest of Mario. She is also friends with Daisy, Luigi, Rosalina ,Toad, and Toadette.\u00a0She serves as the lead female in the Mario series. In Mario Kart 8, she, and Baby Peach return, and a metal counterpart of her, Pink Gold Peach, (who is similar to Metal Mario), is introduced in the series. She is the kind and very beautiful ruler of the Mushroom Kingdom.Characteristics  Since the original game, Peach is often attributed with a fair performance, with decent top speed, quick acceleration, and tight handling. However, in later games, she has only a mediocre drifting capability, being difficult to turn sharp corners quickly. She also takes a longer time to perform a Mini-Turbo, starting from DS onwards. Overall, Peach's performance is notably on par with Toad or Daisy, but not as balanced as Luigi or Mario. She is classified as a medium racer in most appearances, but also light in some games.Appearances Staff ghosts Official Descriptions and Statistics Mario Kart: Double Dash!! Mario Kart: Super Circuit Mario Kart DS Mario Kart Wii Trivia! Bowser's Castle  This article can refer to two or more different things. If you were linked here from an article, please change the link on the article to the appropriate page.Super Mario Kart  Super Mario Kart (styled as SUPER MARIOKART and abbreviated to SMK) is the very first video game in the Mario Kart series, made for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in September 1992. Later was pre-installed on to the Super NES Classic Edition in September 2017, 25 years after its original release. Players race go-karts as one of eight characters from the Super Mario series and aim for the gold.Gameplay  Super Mario Kart can be played by one or two players. All gameplay uses a forced split screen view. In single player mode, the top part of the screen displays the course in behind-kart view, while the bottom half of the screen can either display a rear-view mirror perspective, or an overhead view of the whole track, displaying where all the racers are at the moment. In multiplayer, the bottom screen is assigned to the second player's view.Controls Modes Single Player Modes Mario GP  The first single player mode is Mario GP (later known as Grand Prix), in which one player races seven computer-controlled drivers. Engine classes of 50cc, 100cc, and 150cc are available, but 150cc must be unlocked by beating the game in 100cc difficulty. Larger engines result in faster vehicles and as such a greater level of difficulty. There are four cups to select: the Mushroom Cup, the Flower Cup, the Star Cup, and the Special Cup. The Special Cup must be unlocked by winning gold in the other three Cups, in 100cc mode. Each cup consists of five tracks, and the player must finish the race in fourth place or better to advance to the next track. Racers ranked fifth to last are \"RANKED OUT\" and forced to either use a continue to try again if applicable (Thus so losing a kart), or retire and end the game. All tracks are five laps long. If the player presses  &  at the same time, the selected character will be small until the player presses the buttons together again.Mario GP scoring process  In order to win the cup, the player must have the highest total number of points at the end of the fifth track of the cup. Points are awarded at the end of each track, as follows\u00a0: Ending the cup as 1st to 3rd gives the player the gold, silver or bronze cup respectively, while ending in 4th do not award any cup. The character is shown during the award ceremony near the podium, crying while first three CPU racers celebrate and rejoice, with a special theme played and a text displayed on-screen. No cup is awarded in this case, and therefore the player must restart the entire cup, in hopes of achieving a better performance.Time Trial  Time Trial mode has the player race through one track of his/her own choice, with the racer of its choice, in an attempt to set a record for best lap or overall course time. Due to the SNES's hardware limitations, the times recorded are deleted as soon the console is turned off. All items are taken out in this mode, and so the times achieved rely solely on driving skills. If the driving session is perfect (no falling, spin out or offroad), the ghost can eventually reappear on following sessions, allowing the player to further improve his driving skills.Multiplayer Modes Mario GP  Mario GP mode plays just like the single player version, but with one less computer-controlled driver. In order to proceed to the next track, only one player must rank in the top four. The first player will receive a Game Over if they rank out three times, and the other player continues alone.Match Race  Match Race mode (later known as VS. Mode), pits the two players in a one-on-one race on any track.Battle Mode  In Battle Mode, two players choose from four battle arenas specially designed for Battle Mode and try to pop the three balloons surrounding the other player (representing their lives) by hitting them with items such as Koopa shells or banana peels. The last player with at least one balloon wins.Racers  The eight available drivers can be classified by four attributes: top speed, steering, strength, and acceleration. The eight characters are grouped in pairs, each pair sharing the same stats and having the same bonus to a particular attribute. Here are the racers\u00a0:Tracks  Super Mario Kart features a total of 20 race tracks, divided into four cups of five each. Tracks with numbers are part of series, which means that all tracks with the same name but different numbers are set in the same universe, and as such share the same name, background, track elements, enemies, obstacles and music theme. This was due to the SNES hardware limitations of the time, that did not allow the original Mario Kart game from having all-distinctive courses. The game could only handle eight different universes, and Rainbow Road is the only one which has an entire universe for its own, having exclusive background, enemies (Rainbow Thwomps), name and theme song. In Mario Kart DS and so on, a SNES is put before the track name (ex. SNES Donut Plains 3). In later games after this one, the four cups are only four courses instead of five. This track is available in Mario Kart 8 with The Legend of Zelda DLC or Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.Battle stages  Super Mario Kart has its own Battle Mode dedicated stages to battle on. These aren't circuits, but battle arenas instead.World Records  Like all other Mario Kart games, Super Mario Kart has its own Time Trial World Records. Here is a list of the current times for each course.NTSC version (Japan, North America, Brazil, ...)  For an up-to-date version and for 1-lap records, see the official NTSC world records pagePAL version (Europe, ...)  For an up-to-date version and for 1-lap records, see the official PAL world records pageItems  Items are either offensive or supportive and are picked up when driving over a yellow\u00a0? tile sitting on the track. The probabilities of receiving a particular item are dependent on the place the player is in, with more powerful items such as Stars and Thunderbolts given when the player is further back. The exception to this being the CPU players, who all have an unlimited amount of a certain item, such as Princess Toadstool and Toad's Poison Mushrooms, Mario and Luigi's infinite stars or Bowser's Fireballs.Production Credits  Executive Producer\u00a0: Hiroshi Yamauchi Producer\u00a0: Shigeru Miyamoto Programmers\u00a0: Masato Kimura, Hajime Yajima, Kenji Yamamoto C.G.

Funky Kong  Funky Kong was first seen in the Donkey Kong series as a minor character. Mario Kart Wii marks his first appearance in a Mario Kart game. Funky Kong is a large type character and must be unlocked by unlocking four Expert Staff Ghosts in Time Trials. Funky Kong is widely used among competitive players due to his very high-speed stat. In fact, as of September 17, 2018, 23 of the 32 shortcut records and 11 of the 14 non-shortcut records on the main page of the Mario Kart Wii world records website were set using Funky Kong, while the others were done using characters like Daisy, Yoshi, and, surprisingly, some of the baby characters. He also has an off-road bonus. Funky Stadium is a Battle Stage named after him in Mario Kart Wii. He hasn't appeared in recent Mario Kart games yet due to his overpowered stats in Mario Kart Wii.Characteristics  Your first appearences was in Donkey Kong Country Trilogy as a mechanical and pilot of Kongs, even helping when necessary. Although he is mainly associated with his red bandana and cool shades, your look was modified in Donkey Kong 64, marked more as a soldier than a hip-hop gangster. He had black combat boots, a dark green, camouflaged tank top shirt with matching pants and an ammunition bandoleer around his waist. He also had red sunglasses (nowhere near as cool as his shades now), and an army cap with the same camouflaged design as his shirt. And one thing the cool version of Funky Kong didn't have was a huge RPG-7 (missile launcher) slung across his back like the Donkey Kong 64 version of him did. Funky Kong will always miss that RPG-7. In Mario Kart Wii, he's back at original style. He now wears blue pants that are torn off at his knees, a black belt now replaces his ammo belt, and his tank top is now white. His shades are now a dark color, and he now has a red bandana with white dots on it. His frame is very similar to Donkey Kong, and he even retains DK's classic smile.Karts and Bikes Staff Ghost Tracks  * = Retro courseBattle Stages In other games  Funky Kong is not usually featured as a playable character in most Donkey Kong games, but more of a side character that helps Donkey Kong and friends along the way by giving them new abilities or equipment. One of his most famous appearances was in Donkey Kong Country 3 where he make vehicles to Dixie and Kiddy Kong that help to explore the map and find collectibles.Yoshi  Yoshi (full name T. Yoshisaur Munchakoopas) has been Mario's best friend since Super Mario World for the SNES. His undeniable cuteness has lent him a cult following among the younger and some older Mario Kart fans. He says his name repeatedly and in Mario Kart Wii, he talks in a high-pitched voice. He falls under the medium weight class in Mario Kart: Double Dash!!,\u00a0Mario Kart Wii,\u00a0and\u00a0Mario Kart 8,\u00a0but a lightweight in Super Mario Kart, Mario Kart 64,\u00a0Mario Kart Super Circuit, Mario Kart DS,\u00a0and\u00a0Mario Kart 7. . He is one of the most popular characters in the Mario Kart series. Yoshi is one of the 6 characters to appear in every mario kart game.Characteristics  Yoshi is a green dinosaur from the Mushroom Kingdom. He wears orange shoes with yellow bottoms. His hands, body, tail, and head are all a light shade of green. His chest and mouth area are white in color, though. Although he has never been seen without shoes, Boshi's appearance in Super Mario RPG: Legend of Seven Stars as well as the feet of the Yoshi Sphinx in Paper Mario Sticker Star confirms that Yoshi has three clawed toes on each foot and padded feet. Along with his head having orange spikes. He has a red shell that has a white rim on his back. Some of his powers include flying and devouring enemies with his long tongue.Karts and Bikes Staff Ghost Tracks  * - Retro trackTrivia! Dry Bones  Dry Bones is Koopa Troopa's skeleton, a driver to the Mario Kart scene, after appearing as Mario's enemy in his many previous adventures. He has appeared in Mario Kart DS and Mario Kart Wii as an unlockable driver, and as a Starter Character in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, he was confirmed in the reveal trailer for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. He usually adds a great handling, acceleration, and mini-turbo boost to his Karts, but as a consequence, they have low top speeds.Characteristics  Dry Bones is the dead version of Koopa Troopa. He is most likely a skeleton because he fell in lava because he only appears in Bowser Castle's in Super Mario Bros. games. But anyway, he has the same shape as Koopa Troopa, but is a white/ grayish color, due to all his bones. He wears white gloves and boots. Very fashionable, right? His shell is all pale and cracked up, and his torso is his rib cage. He also has sharp teeth, and instead of white, lively eyes, he has gaping black eyes with yellow pupils. Ohh, scary. Outside of the Mario Kart series, a variation called \"Parabones\" can be seen, it's a Dry Bones, but with wings, this variation only appears in 3D games, the normal and winged Dry Bones never appear in the same games besides Super Mario Maker. In the Super Mario Bros Games, when one stomps on one, they fall apart, only to resurrect and resume their stroll on a platform, however, a superstar can get rid of them for good.Vehicles Karts Mario Kart DS Mario Kart Wii Bikes Staff Ghost Tracks Trivia! Tracks  This category includes every race track in the Mario Kart series.R.O.B.  R.O.B. (short for Robotic Operating Buddy) is an accessory for the Nintendo Entertainment System who has recently made appearances in a few Mario games. In Japan, he is known as the Famicom Robot, which is short for Family Computer Robot. R.O.B. functions by translating flashes of information on the television screen into physical actions (using technology similar to the Zapper Gun). R.O.B. was first used for the game Gyromite. Players could control R.O.B. with the control pad to make him raise and lower gyroscopes. To make the gyroscope spin, the player must set the object in the gyroscope spinner and then balance it on one of the two round trays that are connected to controller two. Placing a gyro on the red tray lowers the red GATES; placing a gyro on the blue tray lowers the blue GATES. R.O.B. is also the last unlockable character in Mario Kart DS. To unlock R.O.B., players have to win the Mirror Special Cup. In the game, he is one of the heaviest characters, his weight matched only by Bowser. R.O.B's symbol is a purple NES D-Pad. R.O.B. has two original karts are the ROB-BLS and the ROB-LGS. His karts are fast, heavy, and have good handling, which is uncharacteristic of a heavy character. R.O.B. doesn't return in subsequent games, probably as he is now in Super Smash Bros. Brawl and its sequels.Characteristics  R.O.B. looks like what any robot should. He has a flat tread for legs, a thin frame with a rail on it so his arms can move up and down, arms can swivel, a black electrical cord going from his back to his \"feet\" but not touch each other (so how does he clap when someone wins something?), a black electrical cord going from his back to his \"feet\", and to top it off, a metallic head with blazing read eyes. Except for his arms and the rim around this eyes, which are black, his whole frame is white/gray, although he has different color schemes in other Nintendo games, such as Super Smash Bros. Brawl.Karts Staff Ghost Tracks Trivia! King Boo  King Boo is the king of all Boos, and although he is not the biggest Boo, he is the most powerful of his kind. He is very sneaky and can summon anyone's special item in Mario Kart: Double Dash!!. He is an unlockable character in Mario Kart: Double Dash!! and Mario Kart Wii. He was a playable character during a limited-time event campaign in Mario Kart Arcade GP DX held between October 18, 2017, and January 10, 2018. In the Japanese version, though, Bana Passport users could unlock him permanently by collecting three in-game stamps. In Mario Kart DS, he is a boss in Mission Mode, and like all bosses, he came from Super Mario 64 DS, but was mistakenly called Big Boo in Super Mario 64 DS. His karts and bikes are black shaded (the same color as R.O.B.'s were in Mario Kart DS and Dry Bowser's in Mario Kart Wii). Despite being an excellent handler, King Boo is a mid-tier character for his poor raising stats. King Boo is often used for courses with tight turns, such as Rainbow Road. Although in the mid-tier placing, King Boo has excellent rivalries with other characters and has excellent racing skills, making him a character with high-tier or highly possible, top-tier character categories since his handling stat raises any kart or bike, including the Spear. He was never a default playable character until Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.Unlocking Criteria Characteristics  King Boo is the king of all the Boos. His body is a ghostly white color, most likely because he is a ghost. He has a round shape with two arms on either side of his body (or face, it's tough to tell), and he has a tail. He always has his mouth open in a haunting manner, so his tongue and sharp teeth can be seen quite clearly. He has black eyes. So, with that being said, what makes him different from a regular Boo? He is noticeably bigger, and he has a royal golden crown with red and blue jewels encrusted in it. Try to take away his crown, and he will haunt you for the rest of your life!Karts Staff Ghost Tracks  * - Retro trackTrivia!

Are you seriously trying to start with me again?! I hear about this big meeting, and I'm all ready to act nice...But man, the second I see your face, Mr. Nice Bowser is GONE. Yeah, forget your dumb meeting! I'll pummel you and grab Peach!\" - Bowser to Mario in Mario and Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story Bowser is Mario's arch-nemesis. In the Mario & Luigi series he seems to serve as more of an anti-hero, and even openly allies with Mario and Luigi in Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga (however it just was to get Princess Peach's voice back so he could kidnap her). He is, however,\u00a0featured as the main antagonist of the series since Mario & Luigi: Dream Team Bros.History Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga  Bowser appears in this game after Cackletta and Fawful invade the Mushroom Kingdom and steal Princess Peach's voice. He barges into the castle, where he finds Peach crying because she has lost her voice. Then Mario bursts in, dragging Luigi by a clothesline. When Mario sees Bowser, he stops, sending Luigi crashing into Bowser. Angrily, he attacks Mario, who easily defeats Bowser. He then gives Mario a lift to on his Koopa Cruiser. During the ride, Fawful destroys the Koopa Cruiser and Bowser falls in Stardust Fields and is later shot out of a cannon. Bowser loses his memory after being shot out of the cannon and is found by Popple. Bowser begins to believe that he is named Rookie and fights with Popple twice against the Mario Bros. Popple and Rookie(Bowser) find the Beanstar in Woohoo Hooniversity and attempt to steal it, but are beat by the Mario Bros. The Beanstar becomes very angry and flies into the sky, after Popple, Rookie, Mario and Luigi grab on to it. However, they all fall off and Rookie ends up in Stardust Fields again. Fawful then finds Bowser (who had just regained his memory, but was knocked out) and possesses him with Cackletta's spirit. Cackletta then becomes Bowletta. After beating Bowletta, the Mario Bros. are given a present. During the credits, it turns out that Bowser is inside of the box.Mario and Luigi: Partners in Time  In Mario and Luigi: Partners in Time, Bowser appears as a true main antagonist and the game's fourth boss alongside Baby Bowser, not teaming up with Mario in any way. Bowser arrives at Peach`s Castle to kidnap Princess Peach. He then falls into a time hole. Mario and Luigi and their baby forms give a chase. The time hole took Bowser to Thwomp Volcano, where he teams up with his baby self. The Mario bros. fight Bowser and Baby Bowser. However, the bros.prevail, and Bowser gets blasted up on a giant Thwomp and before falling off. He falls into the time hole to the present and lands in the castle backyard. Some Toads took him into the castle. When Mario and Luigi and Peach return from Shroob Castle, they see Bowser in Princess Peach's Castle, passed out. The defeated Elder Princess Shroob mushroom sneaks out from from Baby Luigi's pocket. The purple mushroom floats in Bowser's mouth, creating Shrowser. The Mario bros. cannot attack Shrowser, but must defeat him by knocking back his attacks. In Partners in Time, Bowser appears to be dimwitted and having lower intelligenc. This is proven when he didn't reconiize his baby counterpart or was unaware about his past connection.Stats Mario and Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story  Bowser is playable in Mario and Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story, and is the main protagonist of the game, with the Mario Bros. being the deuteragonists. Bowser first shows up at Princess Peach`s meeting, wanting to be a part of it. He tries to burn Peach, but Mario saves her. Bowser then attacks Mario, who, again, easily defeats him. Bowser than gets kicked out of the castle, and lands in Dimble Wood. While wandering the forest, Fawful gives Bowser a magic mushroom that he calls the Lucky Mushroom. However, it is actually a Vacuum Mushroom, turning Bowser into a walking vacuum. Bowser travels back to Peach's Castle and sucks in Mario, Luigi, Peach, and others. Bowser then becomes unconscious until Mario, Luigi, and Starlow wake him up. Confused to somehow be at Cavi Cape, Bowser stomps off, unaware of Mario and Luigi's presence inside him. However, he DOES know that someone is inside of him - they just haven't revealed their name. He also notices that his fire breath isn't working, and he isn't happy about it. After a bit of traveling, Bowser meets Midbus and Fawful. Bowser battles Midbus, but loses when Midbus uses a body slam attack that Bowser cannot block. Fawful reveals that he has captured both Bowser's and Peach's castles; in reply Bowser vows revenge on the crazy Beanish. Almost immediately along the path a strange voice calls out to Bowser, begging him to smash a certain rock. Doing so reveals the first portal of the Chakroad. This teleports him all the way back to where he started, so he re-uses the portal to return. Frustrated and confused at everything that has happened, Bowser stomps off to Plack Beach, beginning his quest to regain his castle. After strolling along the beach, a french accent calls to Bowser, coming from a fellow named Broque. He pleads that Bowser, who looks very strong, pull his island ashore because the bridge broke. Bowser refuses to help until Broque offers a special block that is worth very much. Bowser alone is not powerful enough to pull the island ashore, so the bros. stimulate his muscles to give him enough strength. Broque, who is happy to be saved, hands over a Vacuum Block and shows Bowser how to use it in a battle. Bowser then continues until he finds the Sea Pipe Statue, and decides to destroy it because he thinks that it's ugly. However, due to some tinkering by Fawful, it comes to life and battles Bowser. Bowser has trouble inflicting damage to the stone Blooper, and must suck it up with his new Vacuum ability so that the bros. can defeat it. Bowser, however is trapped after the battle because many palm trees are blocking the exit - and his fire breath is still not working. After the bros. unclog it by defeating a Scutlet, Bowser happily burns down the trees in his way - he also asks who is inside of him. Starlow hastily replies \"Chippy!\", and Bowser continues...only to find Broque again. This time, Broque's dog, Broggy, is disobeying him - so Bowser pounds the dog into obeying, using his Fire Breath and a new skill - the shell defense, which allows Bowser to negate attacks from above. Bowser is then able to continue on to Dimble Wood. Bowser meets Broque AGAIN at the beginning of the Wood, but at least Bowser can now get whatever he wants from Broque's new item shop. Broggy helps, too - and will sell Bowser gear. Broque has one final favor for Bowser - he asks that Bowser find 15 Blitties scattered around the Mushroom Kingdom. Broque would do it himslef, but the Blittens hide inside monsters - the only way to retrieve them is to use Bowser's Vacuum ability. Broque's also offering a nice reward to Bowser - rare gear, and even his dog, Broggy to keep! Bowser continues into the forest, and finds a cage of Goombas on an island. With help from Mario and Luigi, he makes a bridge out of a Wiggler statue and frees them, earning his first special attack. Shortly after, Bowser finds three more of his minions who have escaped his castle with a Banazi Bill cannon. There's only one problem: they forgot ammo. Bowser pulls a Giga-carrot that might work on a local farm. This angers the farmer, and Bowser is forced to eat the carrot within a minute. After finishing, Bowser must battle the Wiggler, because it never expected Bowser to actually eat the carrot. One hard battle later, Bowser gets a Banazi Bill - and a bad stomachache; he cannot continue due to the pain - he begs Chippy to make it stop. Mario and Luigi battle a giant worm that was actually inside the carrot, and Bowser feels better. Bowser also learns to use his Sliding Punch, so he can break harder boulders and cross some gaps. Bowser finally loads the Banazi Bill into the cannon, and fires on his former castle. Midbus is controlling the newly upgraded castle, and flies over the Banazi Bill - to land on top of Bowser. Mario and Luigi save Bowser by getting his adrenaline going - they do such a job that Bowser grows to gigantic proportions. Bowser mashes his castle in an enormous battle, but the castle flies back to its original position after being battered enough. Being out of danger, Bowser shrinks to his normal size, and implores Chippy to make him big again. Because adrenaline doesn't work quite that easily, Bowser continues to his castle at his normal size. Along the road to his castle, Bowser encounters another cage of his minions - a group of Shy Guys. After freeing these minions, Bowser finally reaches his castle... only to watch it start to fly away. Midbus then appears and throws an enormous iron ball at Bowser. Bowser catches it, and struggles to keep it from crushing him. The bros. increase Bowser's muscle power again, allowing Bowser to throw the iron ball back to Midbus and ground the castle. Bowser enters his castle and is greeted by his minions, who call him a guest. Bowser soon realizes (with some help from Chippy) that Fawful has taken control of not only Bowser's Castle, but most of his minions, too. Bowser gets very annoyed that the greeter Goombas keep saying the same thing over and over again. Eventually, a set of doors open and many minions stampede into it. Bowser is the last to enter Fawful's theater, and is angered to find that there are no seats left. Eventually, a special seat (Bowser's throne) rises from the floor and Bowser takes his seat. Fawful appears on the stage and begins the \"Fawful Show\", announcing the special guest, Bowser. Bowser's seat suddenly rockets to the front, and Bowser is ejected onto the stage. Enraged, Bowser demands that he pound Fawful - but Fawful traps Bowser and Midbus in a cage, for a fight to the death. With his new shell defense, Bowser wins. Bowser is hurriedly rushed to the VIP room, which is full of his favorite (but unhealthy) foods. Boos begin stuffing his face until he falls through the floor and becomes humiliated. Bowser pleads and begs Chippy to restore his weight, so Mario and Luigi enter the Flab Zone. There, they finally find Peach, who is stolen by a large group of Beta Kretins. After persuing the Beta Kretins for a bit, they release Peach and for an Alpha Kretin that the bros. must face. After the difficult battle, Peach explains Fawful's plot to get the Dark Star to Mario, Luigi, and Starlow. Just then, Fawful and Midbus arrive underneath Bowser. Fawful uses a special ray to extract Peach from Bowser's body and return her to her normal size. Midbus then pushes a tredmill directly underneath Bowser, and he falls the rest of the way through the floor. After (literally) burning a lot of calories, Bowser lights on fire (but he seems to like it). Due to Bowser's limited intelligence, he begins to read a sign near a large number of Bob-ombs... and gets blown out of his castle. He lands in the tunnels directly beneath the first Chakroad he discovered.\n After wandering a bit and defeating Choombas, Bowser stumbles upon a group of his minions: this time, Monty Moles. The moles have been busy carrying out Bowser's Project K: to dig a tunnel so Bowser can make a getaway after stealing Peach. Bowser doesn't remember this at first, but seems to after he is reminded. The moles have hit a problem, however - they have hit very hard dirt. Furious, Bowser pushes the drill, activating its battery - which only lasts for 1 minute and 30 seconds. The battery is also quite pricey, at 50 coins apiece. If Bowser fails to make it, all of his progress is buried when he goes back to replace the battery. Eventually, with help from the bros (inside of him), he triumphantly drills to Toad Town Underground. The tunnel collapses behind him. With not many places to go, Bowser wanders into a room. He triggers a security system on accident, but does not leave as instructed. Bowser is electrocuted with a high voltage, and faints. The bros. then leave his body (through the Pipe Works) and search for the Dark Star. If they enter the chamber with Bowser, the security system will shock the Koopa King again - but he will remain unconscious. Bowser is not seen again until the bros. enter Toadley's Clinic. Dr. Toadley announces that Mario and Luigi have a horrible disease - Bowseritis! As if on que, Bowser enters the room and battles the bros - he does not know that they have been helping him all along. Mario and Luigi defeat him, but Bowser remains to learn about the three Star Cures - the first is supposed to be in Dimble Wood. Exited, Bowser stomps off to Dimble Wood, determined collect them before the Mario Bros. However, the first star sage (as Mario and Luigi remember) is NOT in Dimble Wood - Bowser unknowingly ate the sage in the Giga-Carrot. Mario finds a pipe that allows the bros. to re-enter Bowser. After a long chase, the bros. catch up and battle the worm again, and secure the first Star Cure. Dr. Toadley then sends a message to Bowser, congratulating the bros. and revealing that the second cure should be on Plack Beach. Enraged that the Mario Bros. somehow beat him to the Star Cure, Bowser begins heading to the beach, but a minion informs him that the Cure was moved to Bowser Castle - explaining that the Cure was taken and held, just because it might be important. Bowser happily speeds to his castle, convinced that he cannot be beaten by the Mario Bros. THIS time. He smashes frees some caged Bob-ombs, who join Bowser on his quest. Bowser remembers that he put the Cure in a safe, which was thrown in his secret treasure room. After entering his treasure room, Bowser is shocked to find a set of train tracks running right through the room. The Fawful Express appears and makes a stop here, but Bowser is determined to destroy it - after all, His secret treasue room isn't secret ANYMORE! Bowser stands in front of the train, desperately trying to stop it from continuing, but he is smashed repeatedly by rocks on the track. He almost succeeds - only to be crushed between the train and a huge rock. The Mario Bros. ford the Adrenaline Channel again, and Bowser once again becomes huge. In panic, the train turns around - hoping to cross a small wooden bridge and lose Mega-Bowser. Bowser bakes the train with his Fire Breath, smashing mountains along the way. Bowser eventually destroys the Fawful Express, and returns to his normal size again. He then returns to his treasure room and finds the safe...only to forget the combination! He BEGS Chippy to search his memory and tell him. Mario and Luigi attempt to retrieve the info, but are stopped by Bowser's memory - of them! Once the Memory Bros. are defeated, the combination is found, and repaired - and Bowser suddenly remembers it. Frantic and excited, Bowser throws open the safe door - and retrieves the second Star Cure. The minions that helped him in Dimble Wood are also present, and they tell Bowser that something else is in the safe. While searching for it in the now-empty safe, his minions push him in - revealing that they have abandoned him for Fawful. Locked in the safe, Bowser moved to a new location. Bowser loses hope, and when Chippy asks for the Star Cure, Bowser eats it - thus unknowingly giving it to the Mario Bros. They leave his body again, and find the third Cure without Bowser. Bowser is not seen again until the Mario Bros. defeat Junker at Peach's Castle. The defeated robot runs off and throw Bowser's safe, breaking it and revealing the koopa king. He has hurt his back from being cramped in the safe for so long, and lies helpless on the ground. Mario and Luigi re-enter his body and perform back surgery (which takes a while) in Bowser. After finishing, Bowser realizes that he feels even more limber than before, learning his Spike Ball move. Bowser storms Peach's Castle, collecting keys and another cage of minions - this time Magikoopas. Bowser corners Fawful and Midbus before the Dark Star's seal is broken; as a last-ditch staler, Fawful turns Midbus into Blizzard Midbus - who is defeated once and for all by Bowser. Fawful hastily absorbs what Dark Star power he can before Bowser knocks him out of the way. Newly awakened, the Dark Star enters Bowser. The Dark Star steals bits of Bowser's DNA, creating an almost-complete dark version of Bowser. The Mario Bros. defeat the Dark Star before it can copy Bowser's legs. The Dark Star exits Bowser and assumes its leg-less Dark Bowser form. Dark Bowser steals Peach, but Bowser persues him - only to find Dark Fawful. Dark Fawful turns Peach's Castle into a giant robot with the push of a button, and it crushes Bowser. Mario and Luigi ford Bowser's adrenaline channel for the final time, and Bowser defeats the castle in a long, hard, and painful battle. Bowser peruses Dark Fawful, and defeats him in the wrecked conference room of Peach's Castle. Fawful nearly ceases to exist, kept barely alive by the dark power he absorbed - he becomes the Dark Fawful Bug. Suddenly, the Dark Fawful Bug is vacuumed up - by Dark Bowser. By comepleting the dark power again, Dark Bowser grows legs and smashes his way to the very top of Peach's Castle. Bowser follows him, but Dark Bowser continues fleeing. Cornered on the highest tower of Peach's Castle, Dark Bowser releases a large hurricane of dark power, which spreads over the entire Mushroom Kingdom. Starlow/Chippy finally decides to tell Bowser that Mario and Luigi are inside of him, but Bowser can't hear her over the wind. Dark Bowser comments that the Mushroom Kingdom will soon vanish into darkness. Bowser replies that this is the perfect backdrop for their final battle, and declares that the Mushroom Kingdom is his - so DARK BOWSER must vanish. Both Bowsers breath fire at each other, which begins the epic final battle. In battle, Bowser must do 1000 HP of damage to Dark Bowser. Dark Bowser will then fall down, seemingly defeated - but the Dark Fawful Bug heals him and makes him huge. Dark Bowser then throws a large ball of Dark Minions at Bowser - who has to walk back to the battlefield. Bowser then must punch Dark Bowser's belly, causing him to cough up the Dark Fawful Bug and shrink to his original size. Bowser then vacuums up the Dark Fawful Bug - against the power of both the Bug and Dark Bowser - but Bowser sucessfully inhales the Bug. Once inside Bowser, the Bug grows tremendously for the battle against the bros. Mario and Luigi must crack the Dark Fawful Bug's glasses and defeat its three Appendages so they can damage the Dark Star Core. If the bros. fail to defeat the Core after a few turns, the Dark Star leaves Bowser - who coughs it up and is caught by Dark Bowser's mouth. Bowser must repeat the cycle until the bros. defeat the Dark Star Core. Once defeated, Dark Bowser beigns to flash colors as he stands there, helpless. Bowser punches him a total of five times, causing Dark Bowser to clear the Mushroom Kingdom of the darkness and explode. Starlow then asks Bowser if Peach is OK - Bowser tries to steal Peach. Fawful seems to have somehow survived and tries to defeat the bros with his final explosion. This causes Bowser to regurgitate everyone inside of him - just as Peach wakes up. Shocked that Mario and Luigi have come out of his gut, Bowser becomes furious. Starlow tries to calm him down - Bowser suddenly recognizes that she is Chippy and becomes even MORE furious. Bowser battles the bros. as the credits roll (and loses to the Green Shell attack). Both castles are repaired, and Peach sends a gift to Bowser... The game ends with Bowser bandaged in his bed, with the three minions that betrayed him begging to re-join. Peach's present arrives, and Bowser wakes up. A magikoopa, probably Kamek, enters the room and orders that the traitors leave (they don't). Bowser's present opens to reveal Starlow - here to check on Bowser. Bowser is still mad, and tells Starlow that his castle got trashed, too - so he's remodeling (which according to Bowser, isn't evil). Starlow leaves, and tells Bowser to enjoy his present. Bowser yells afterward that he doesn't want it - and demands that all his minions return to work on his castle. Kamek leaves. Grateful to rejoin, the three minions also scurry off to work. Bowser makes sure that no one is watching him before opening his present - a cake with him, Mario, Luigi, and Peach on it.Mario and Luigi: Dream Team Bros  In\u00a0Mario & Luigi: Dream Team, in contrast to the previous\u00a0Mario & Luigi\u00a0titles Bowser has a much larger role. He is actually the real main antagonist although he initially seemed to be the secondary antagonist. For the majority of the game, he works alongside\u00a0Antasma, seemingly the main antagonist. They team up when Antasma offers to give Bowser power to defeat the Mario Bros. By stealing the Dream Stone, Bowser and Antasma gained a powerful fortress, Neo Bowser Castle, and Bowser kidnapped Peach. Mario and Luigi tracked down Bowser and Antasma. They battled Bowser in his dream world, where he powered up to an enormous size only to be defeated by Mario and giant Luigi. Bowser was later found holding on to Antasma while Antasma gloated that this time the outcome of the final battle will be different, as Bowser is assisting him. Bowser unexpectedly flung Antasma to the ground, betraying him and showing off his more malicious side. He said that he had been \"playing him like a bat fiddle\" the whole time, and left him to be destroyed by the Mario Bros while using the Dream Stone for himself. When the Dream Stone was destroyed, Bowser inhaled its dust to transform, but the Mario Bros. defeated him, returning him to normal and sending him flying into the distance, although he survived, and remembered Luigi's name (all through the\u00a0Mario & Luigi\u00a0games he calls him \"Green Stache\").Mario and Luigi: Paper Jam Bros  In\u00a0Mario & Luigi: Paper Jam, Bowser and his\u00a0Paper Mario\u00a0counterpart share the spot as the main antagonists. After a magical book brings the Paper characters to the regular world, the two settle their rivalry over the rule of only one Bowser in the world and combine their armies to conquer the Mushroom Kingdom. Although they work together to kidnap both Princess Peaches and defeat the Mario Bros. and Paper Mario, they both find each other very irritating and secretly plan to betray one another once they have succeeded in their goal of getting rid of both Marios. After the Mario Bros. raid their castle once and save the princesses, the Bowsers attack Peach's castle in retaliation for Mario defeating their Juniors. At the end of the game, the two face the Mario Bros. in their flying castle and explain their plan to trap the trio in the magic book and burn it. The two combine with each other to create Shiny RoboBowser, although Mario, Luigi, and Paper Mario are able to defeat it. Bowser is knocked back by the destruction of RoboBowser and plummets to the ground below from his castle, dropping the book in the process, while the trio use the book on Paper Bowser and return him to his world, much to his dismay. L  Later, Paper Bowser attacks the paper world, forcing Paper Mario to quickly return to his world, while in the real world Bowser is also preparing to attack the KingdomPersonality  In the Mario and Luigi games, Bowser is a guy who wants what he wants and nothing else. He gets mad at anyone who gets in his way even if it's his own minions. Bowser has an extremely short temper and he always wants to be better than Mario. He'll take any available resources to take him down. He seems to not want to make a fool in front of his nemesis. He doesn't seem to remember Luigi's name, calling him Green Guy, Green Mario Brother, Green Wim, and mostly- Green Stache.Abilities  Fire breath (All the games): Bowser's most prominent attack in all games where he appears is his ability to spit fire in all its forms, like those of larger or smaller fire balls or that of a continuous fire stream. Superhuman strength (Mario and Luigi: Bowser's inside story): Bowser possesses superhuman strength, further enhanced by the action of the Mario brothers in his body. Unpowered, it is capable of lifting a large ball with great difficulty. Powered, it is capable of moving islands or even lifting a castle.\u00a0 Superhuman durability (All the games): Bowser is extremely resistant to damage. He was able to survive the explosion of his castle without damage, survived falls several times, and was even able to keep some life by being crushed by his castle. Giant metamorphosis (Bowser's inside story, Mario and Luigi: Dream Team Bros): Bowser can turn into a giant if his body is full of adrenaline, or in his dreams.As Dreamy Bowser  \ufffc\ufffcPortals: Dreamy Bowser is able to create portals at his will to summon dream enemies. Telekinesis: Dreamy Bowser can lure Mario and Luigi to him to take them in his hand.Princess Peach  Princess Peach, also called just Peach is a character in the Mario and Luigi series and the actual princess of the Mushroom Kingdom. In the Mario & Luigi games, she frequently gets kidnapped (but ususally not at the beginning) by villains such as Cackletta, Princess Shroob, Fawful, Antasma, Bowser, and Paper Bowser. Mario & Luigi have to embark on epic action packed adventures to save her (rarely teaming up with Bowser) and in some cases teaming up with others such as Baby Mario, Baby Luigi, Dreamy Luigi, and Paper Mario.History Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga  At the beginning of Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga, Cackletta and her assistant Fawful disguise themselves as peace ambassadors and attempt to steal Princess Peach's voice. They replaced it with an \"explosive vocabulary,\" but what they did not know is that they had the wrong Peach. A while earlier, Prince Peasley and others arrived to warn the real Princess. She hid and watched the whole incident while Cackletta stole a disguised Birdo's voice. However, she failed to tell Mario, Luigi and Bowser before they set out.Mario and Luigi: Partners in Time  At the beginning of Mario and Luigi: Partners in Time, Peach takes Professor Professor Elvin Gadd's time machine and travels to the Mushroom Kingdom of the past. However, an alien race called the Shroobs had invaded, and attacked the Princess. She trapped the Elder Princess Shroob in the Cobalt Star (the fuel source of the time machine), and broke it into six pieces. The younger Princess Shroob then took Peach captive. The Mario bros. eventually saw Peach, but Princess Shroob fed her to Petey Piranha. The Bros. defeat Petey and find a princess with a strange purple mushroom stuck on her face. They take the princess (who is actually Princess Shroob in disguise) but to the present, but Bowser attempts to steal the princess, thinking she's the real deal. He messes up and breaks a bridge in Peach's Castle, falling into a time hole. At the end of the game, the Mario bros. defeat Princess Shroob and save Peach. Just when they think that they're all done, Baby Bowser puts the Cobalt Star together and accidentally releases an angry Elder Princess Shroob. The bros. defeat the her, and return with Peach to the present, bringing the babies with them one final time. When they return to the castle, everyone finds Bowser passed out in Peach's Castle. The mushroom remains of the Elder Princess Shroob sneak out of Baby Luigi's pocket and is eaten by Bowser, who then becomes Shrowser. The bros. defeat Shrowser by deflecting his attacks, and then Baby Mario, Baby Luigi, Baby Princess Peach, and Toadsworth the Younger go back to their own time.Fawful  \"Your lives that I spit on are now but the caricature of a cartoon drawn by a kid who is stupid!\" -Fawful to the Mario Bros. \"I have fury!\" -Fawful's famous catchphrase Fawful is a Beanish Toady, and former underling to Cackletta. He is a recurring character throughout the Mario & Luigi series. He made his debut in Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga. Apart from Bowser, he is the most prominent villain in the series, appearing in the first three games. He also has a strange speech pattern, constantly mixing up words and making metaphors about food.History Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga  At the beginning, Cackletta and Fawful invaded Princess Peach's castle, posing as ambassadors. Cackletta disguised herself as Lady Lima. Fawful, with his Headgear, sucked up the Princess's voice and replaced it with a literally explosive vocabulary. The two then took to the skies. That evening, as Fawful and Cackletta traveled to the Beanbean Kingdom, they were pursued by Bowser, Mario, and Luigi on Bowser's new weapon, the Koopa Cruiser. Cackletta fled, leaving Fawful to take care of the Bowser and the Mario Bros. He easily took Bowser down with one shot from his Headgear, and attacked Mario and Luigi, who easily destroyed his Headgear and defeated him. Fawful then summoned another Headgear and shouted out his famous line, \"I HAVE FURY\"! With several shots from the new Headgear, he took down the Koopa Cruiser and sent Mario, Luigi, and Bowser plummeting toward Stardust Fields. Soon, Fawful made it to Hoohoo Mountain, and destroyed the bridge preventing anyone from reaching the summit. He made it to the top of the mountain himself, and saw he was being chased by Prince Peasley. He transformed the prince into a horrifying monster and shut him inside an egg. Fawful then proceeded to fly back down the mountain. Later, Mario and Luigi made it to Hoohoo Mountain, where they heard numerous rumors about Prince Peasley and a perpetrator who \"wore an odd helmet and spoke of mustard and fink rats\". Mario and Luigi, obviously recognizing him, set off to climb the mountain, but found that Fawful had destroyed the bridge. Eventually, the two saw Fawful near the path to the base of the mountain. Fawful blasted away a Beanbean Guard, and upon seeing the Mario Bros., dropped a statue in front of them. Fawful then made his way to the Beanbean Castle Town and together, he and Cackletta badly damaged the town. With the town under their control, Cackletta and Fawful forced Queen Bean to swallow a Belly Blech Worm, turning her into a massive muscular beast. The two then locked away the castle attendants and Lady Lima in the castle's sewer. Cackletta then disguised herself as Lady Lima for the second time, and the two awaited the Mario Bros. Of course, Mario and Luigi showed up, and Cackletta, posing as Lady Lima, said that she believed the Mario Bros. were impostors. She dropped them into a trapdoor into the castle's sewer, telling them that to prove themselves as the heroic plumbers, they had to fix the castles' plumbing. Mario and Luigi, of course, easily completed this task, and freed Lady Lima and the castle attendants from a cage. Lady Lima, of course, was grateful, but the Mario Bros. were confused, as she was the one who had ordered them to fix the plumbing, however she denied this. Meanwhile, up above, in the vault of the Beanstar, a powerful, sleeping granter of wishes, Cackletta and Fawful watched as the force field around the Beanstar vanished, leaving them to take it, because the way to get the Beanstar was to fix the castle's plumbing. Indeed, this was the object of Cackletta's and Fawful's desires all along, and by stealing Princess Peach's voice, they could awaken the Beanstar. This was because Princess Peach has an excellent, beautiful voice, the perfect one to awaken the Beanstar. So, they stole the Beanstar, but then the Mario Bros. arrived. Cackletta then unleashed the monstrous beast that was Queen Bean upon them, and she and Fawful fled the castle with the Beanstar in tow. After the Mario Bros. retrieved the Chuckola Reserve from the Chucklehuck Woods, they made the unconscious Queen Bean drink it, and she spat out the Belly Blech Worm. She then explained all of Cackletta's plans to the Mario Bros., but reassured them they had the better hand all along. Prince Peasley then appeared and told them he had learned of Cackletta's and Fawful's whereabouts: Woohoo Hooniversity. The two had traveled there because it was the perfect place to awaken the Beanstar. When Mario and Luigi got to the Hooniversity, however, they find that Cackletta and Fawful had ransacked the place, and turned all the researchers into monsters. After opening the Sun Door, and going through the Hooniversity's many corridors and battling monsters, the Mario Bros. opened the door to the main lab. Meanwhile, in the main lab itself, Cackletta and Fawful set up Peach Bots which would speak Princess Peach's voice to the Beanstar, awakening it, so Cackletta could use its magic. Mario and Luigi sneaked into the lab, but not before Cackletta activated the Peach Bots. The Beanstar heard the voice, and went mad, and blasted a hole into the ground, and it and the Peach Bots fell into the basement. The Mario Bros. then showed themselves to Cackletta and Fawful, and Luigi pounded Fawful into the ground. Cackletta then fought Mario and Luigi valiantly, and the two injured her so much that she couldn't move. Fawful then rose back out of the ground, and sucked up Cackletta's essence with his Headgear. Cackletta ordered Fawful to attack the Mario Bros, but then Prince Peasley burst upon the scene and blasted Fawful out of the Hooniversity. As Mario and Luigi made their way through Oho Oasis, an injured and tired Fawful landed in Stardust Fields. He saw Bowser's injured form lying on the ground, and in a last ditch effort to save Cackletta from death, transmitted her essence into Bowser's body, and Bowser transformed into Bowletta. Meanwhile, Princess Peach arrived in the Beanbean Kingdom-with her voice. It is then revealed that Prince Peasley had arrived in the Mushroom Castle, and had warned Peach and Toadsworth of Cackletta's plan. So the Peach whose voice was stolen was Birdo, which was why the Beanstar had reacted so strangely to Peach's voice. However, no one was aware that Bowletta and Fawful had learned of Princess Peach's journey to Beanbean, and so began plotting... Quite a while later, Peach and the Mario Bros. journeyed through Teehee Valley to Little Fungitown. However, Mario became sick with Bean Fever after eating a Invincishroom, so Luigi had to journey to Guffawha Ruins to find the cure: Crabbie Grass. However, after Luigi got back, something was amiss. On his way back to the Little Fungitown Embassy, Bowletta in Bowser's Koopa Clown Car kidnapped Peach and with Fawful they fled to Joke's End. When Mario and Luigi returned to Beanbean Castle, they got a message from Bowletta: if they ever wanted to see Princess Peach again, then they had to reassemble the broken Beanstar and bring it to her. After they did, they received a new message: that Bowletta and Fawful were at Joke's End. Together the Bros. went through the icy palace, going through mazes and puzzles. Finally, Mario and Luigi made it to the top of Joke's End. There was a gate, so Luigi had to tunnel underneath. Fawful was there, and he demanded that Luigi give him the Beanstar. So Luigi opened his suitcase, and pulled out a fake Beanstar, which an angry Fawful blasted away. Fawful then stole the real Beanstar and flew to Cackletta and Peach, who were in the Koopa Clown Car. Suddenly Mario came up to them and demanded they release Peach. Bowletta, of course, said \"no\", then Mario started chuckling. Then Luigi in Princess Peach's extra dress came up, and claimed that she (he) was the real Peach, and the one Bowletta and Fawful had was a fake. Bowletta then shocked Mario with a blast of lightning and dropped the real Peach on the ground, and picked up the one that was really Luigi. Bowletta and Fawful then went to the repaired Koopa Cruiser. In the Koopa Cruiser, Bowletta and Fawful rejoiced at the success of their plan. Then, after noticing Peach was covering her mouth with her hands (to cover Luigi's mustache), she scared Peach whose hands flew from her mouth-and Bowletta realized she had been tricked. She ordered Fawful to fire at Luigi, which he did, but then Luigi used the crane to drop some cargo and Bowletta and Fawful's way. Luigi then made it to the front of the Koopa Cruiser and jumped out after stealing the Beanstar back. Bowletta and Fawful made it to the room where Luigi jumped out of too late, however, and Fawful suggested pursuing Luigi but Bowletta had other plans... When the Mario Bros. returned to the Beanbean Castle town, they found it under attack from Bowser's Castle, which was floating in the sky from Bowletta's magic. With the kingdom at stake, the Mario Bros. returned to Hoohoo mountain, and sought out the help of Blablanadon, who flew them up to Bowser's Castle, which they of course entered. Meanwhile, in the throne room, Fawful reported to Bowletta that the Mario Bros. had infiltrated the castle. To apprehend the two intruders, Bowletta sent the seven Koopalings after them.  After defeating the Koopalings and solving the various puzzles and avoiding traps in Bowser's Castle, they almost made it to the throne room, but a bridge was out. A ship then rose from the lava, and Fawful emerged. After giving a speech on his opinions of being in service to Cackletta, he proceeded to attack Mario and Luigi. For this battle, Fawful will hide in his ship, which fires lasers, and when the ship has been attacked enough, it will get too hot, and Fawful will fly out, complaining of overheat. Despite his best efforts, Mario and Luigi beat him, however, he was only pretending to be defeated. After pulling that stunt with Mario and Luigi, Prince Peasley came in and knocked him down. But Fawful tricked Peasley as well and shocked him. Luigi then grabbed his hammer and blasted Fawful out of the castle. During the final battle, Cackletta at some point will use an attack where the ghost of Fawful appears, meaning that Fawful is probably dead, but because of his appearance in later Mario and Luigi's, it is proved that he is not dead. So Bowletta was defeated, and Bowser's Castle was destroyed. After this horrendous defeat, Fawful went into seclusion.Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time  Fawful makes an appearance in Mario and Luigi: Partners in Time. When the Mario Bros. and the baby bros. enter the Mushroom Castle's underground area, they spot Fawful entering the pipe system. Only the babies can enter the pipes, and they find Fawful in an underground room. Fawful doesn't realize that the babies are Mario and Luigi, and he explains himself, his defeats at the hands of Mario and Luigi, but is happy to welcome the babies nonetheless. Here he runs a shop called Fawful's Bean 'n' Badge, where the babies can exchange beans dug up from the ground, and trade them to Fawful. Fawful has very rare and exclusive badges here, which he will give away if given enough beans. However he also implies he will return as a villain...Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story  Fawful begins his scheme to conquer the Mushroom Kingdom by selling Blorb Mushrooms to Toads, therefore giving them the Blorbs. He also established a booth in Dimble Woods in which he would sell Bowser a Vacuum Mushroom. When the Koopa King was flung into the forest, he found Fawful's booth. Fawful told him that he had won a \"lucky mushroom\" and that it would give him Lucky Hits every time he attacked Mario. Bowser, of course, without thinking, ate the Mushroom in one bite. Bowser began inhaling everything in sight, under Fawful's control. Warp Pipes, trees, and a box of Hammers were inhaled into his gaping maw. Fawful controlled Bowser, and made him barge into Peach's castle and inhale Mario, Luigi, Toadsworth, Toadbert, Peach, and several Toads. The villain then, with no other obstacles stopping him from capturing Peach's Castle, took it over along with his new henchbeing Midbus. Fawful and Midbus, then, after conquering the castle, went to the Cavi Cape, where Bowser was. Fawful confronted the Koopa King, and had Midbus attack Bowser. Midbus, along with the power of the vacuum mushroom, managed to defeat Bowser. Fawful revealed that he was going to conquer Bowser's Castle. Later, Bowser made it to the Sea Pipe Statue. Fawful sent a Fawfulcopter with a voice transmitter to Bowser, telling him about his success in conquering Bowser's Castle. Fawful had indeed capured Bowser's Castle. He brainwashed most of Bowser's minions, and remade Bowser's military training facility into the Fawful Theater. Finally, Bowser made it to his remade castle. He was distressed to find all of the seats in the Fawful Theater occupied. However, Fawful made a special throne for Bowser in the center of the theater, which the Koopa King gladly accepted. The evil genius presented himself to the brainwashed minions, and announced that a special guest would be a part of the show that day: Bowser himself. The throne with Bowser flew to the stage, and hurled Bowser on the stage. Midbus appeared on the stage, and a cage dropped on top of them. Fawful announced that the feature of that day would be a rematch between Bowser and Midbus. Midbus was soundly defeated by Bowser. However, Fawful had a backup plan. He announced Bowser's victory, and had some Boo minions take Bowser to the VIP Room. The Boos prodded Bowser to eat more and more of Fawful's tasty dishes, which the Koopa King ate ravenously. However, Bowser ate so much that he grew extremely fat and fell halfway through the floor. This, of course, was part of Fawful's plan. Meanwhile, the Flab Zone inside Bowser was opened, and Mario and Luigi rescued Princess Peach from the Kretin. In the room underneath Bowser, Fawful began firing a special ray at Bowser's body. It extracted Princess Peach from the Koopa King's body, allowing Fawful to capture her. Midbus then dragged a treadmill underneath Bowser, and the Koopa King fell onto it, and began running. Fat began literally being burned off of Bowser, setting of a stockpile of Bob-Ombs, blasting Bowser out of his castle. Midbus and Peach went to the princess's newly rennovated castle, while Fawful went after the Dark Star underneath Toad Town. The Mario bros., having recently escaped Bowser, found Fawful, but it was too late. The cackling villain escaped with the Dark Star to Peach's castle. Fawful then used the Dark Star's power to create a blockade in front of the castle. He also deployed an army of robots to protect him in the castle. Later on, Mario and Luigi managed to create the Miracle Cure, which cured the Blorbs and destroyed the blockade in front of the castle. Mario and Luigi then destroyed the Junker robot, which malfunctioned and freed Bowser (who had been locked in a safe). Fawful, knowing Bowser could reach him if he were allowed entry to the castle, put the keys to unlock rooms in the castle in Fawfulcopters, which spirited away. However, Bowser easily found the keys and made it to the base of the castle's main tower. Fawful left his pet Piranha Plants to attack Bowser, but the Koopa King defeated them and made his way to the room with the Dark Star. In the room, Fawful powered up Midbus into Blizzard Midbus. He was soundly defeated by Bowser. Fawful uses his Vacuum Helmet to absorb some of the Dark Star's energy to become Dark Fawful. Dark Fawful activated Peach's Castle, and turned it into a battle robot, but Bowser defeated it. Fawful searched in vain for the Dark Star, which had escaped following Midbus's final defeat. However, Bowser cornered Dark Fawful, and challenged him to a duel. Bowser defeated the unusual villain with ease. All that was left of Fawful was a tiny version of his head, kept alive by the Dark Star's energy. The Dark Star, by then having formed into an almost-complete form of Dark Bowser, founded the barely alive Fawful and inhaled him, completing Dark Bowser. Bowser chased Dark Bowser to the top of the castle's main tower. After punching Dark Bowser in the gut, the dark being spat out the remains of Fawful-the Dark Star Core. Bowser inhaled the core, and, after a tough battle, Mario and Luigi defeated him. Dark Bowser then was destroyed by the real Bowser. Inside Bowser, Fawful spoke to the Mario Bros. In a last ditch effort to defeat them, he sacrificed himself, exploding. However, Mario, Luigi, Starlow, and the Toads Bowser inhaled rode the shock wave out of Bowser. Therefore, ironically, Fawful saved everyone.Personality  Fawful, although he is a bit crazy and psycopathic, he is a technical genius. As he is able to build many large and fancy machines, such as his Headgear. Although he can be extremely angry at times, he does seem to retain his self control. Like many other Beanish people, he laughs a lot. He is known to make many food metaphors, such as the 'Mustard of Doom'. Fawful, according to Bowser, has exceptionally good cooking regarding\u00a0his deserts and meats. Fawful has an odd way of speaking and he also likes to use obscure words such as: Chortles. Fawful dislikes Mario, Luigi, and Bowser since they interfeared with his plans.Quotes Trivia Cackletta  Cackletta is a Beanish witch from the Beanbean Kingdom. She had plans to awaken the Beanstar with Princess Peach's voice, however, her plans were foiled with the teamwork of Mario and Luigi. She only appears in Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga, and is currently presumed dead.Roles  Cackletta plays as the antagonist of Superstar Saga. She steals Princess Peach's voice in order to awaken the Beanstar. However, the Mario Bros. defeated her and regained the Beanstar. After being defeated, her crazy sidekick, Fawful, sucks up her spirit. Cackletta's spirit possesses Bowser, who was knocked out, and becomes Bowletta. As Bowletta, Cackletta instructs the Mario Bros. to give them the Beanstar at Joke's End and give it to her and Fawful in exchange for Princess Peach. The Mario Bros., however, once again foil her plans and end up leaving with the Beanstar and Princess Peach. Later in the game, the Mario Bros. fight Bowletta in Bowser's Castle. They succeed in this, until they are tricked, blown up by a Time Bob-Omb, and inhaled by Bowletta. Inside her, they fight Cackletta's spirit. After she is destroyed, she disappears and never appears again in the Mario Series. It is likely she perished.Powers and abilities  Magic: Clacketta is a powerful witch with great destructive magical powers. High intelligence: Clacketta has a great tactical mind. She was able to implement a complex plan to steal the Veget star by effectively manipulating the Mario brothers.Trivia Fawfulfury65  Hi, welcome to Mario and Luigi Wiki!

So basically, I will not be on the wiki for a couple of my hours off the wiki. --G00mba 09:56, January 2, 2010 (UTC)Hi!  Hi, Fawfulfury65. Glad you sorted out the user thing. Anyway, thanks for joining my wiki! I have something I would like you to do for me. I am going on vacation soon, and I don't have internet access there. And I need someone to run this wiki.

See you in about 2 weeks. - Shadow34 P.S. can you design any templates?Hi  Well, I guess you don't need to worry about much vandalism as so few people visit my wiki, even though it is larger than most. As for templates and such, I always screw those up, so I guess I'll have to find someone to help with those. If you know anyone who might be interested in joining this wiki, can you ask them? I don't believe I get much web traffic these days (though I haven't the slightest idea how to check!). Anyway, my favorite character is Fawful too (actually he is tied with Waluigi). I love the way he talks! Also, my love of him is the reason his article is the only finished one on this site!

I was pretty impressed with the wiki when I saw it! - Shadow34Awesome!!!  Hey!!!!! Im back from vacation early. You got better at Brawl scince the first time we played!!!!!!! If you want to win a lot U should use Yoshi. Im pretty good with Meta Knight, so next time I will choose him XD . Ratfink43 I have an SD card, so I can take a picture with my Dsi and transfer it to my Wii Photo channel and send the pictures to your Wii!!! What coulour is your DSi, blue or black? mine is blue\u00a0:). The Webkinz account question was pretty random, but as a matter of fact, I do have one!!!! I have 24 Webkinz and my account. I have a Key Lime Dino, his name is Yoshi!!!! my monkeys name is Brownie, but his nickname is diddy kong!!!! Ratfink43 My Webkinz username is READY10. Most of my Webkinz arent named after mario characters becuase I started collecting Webkinz when I was 6, and I didnt know Mario existed until I was 8. So Ill add you as a Webkinz friend. Do you know the show \"Total Drama Island\"? Well, when my friends James and Alex come over they bring thier Webkinz and we do Total Webkinz Island! Also, do u know \"The Peinguins of Madagascar\"? If they made a video game of that TV show, Id buy it the first day that it comes out!!!!! Ratfink43 Me and my friend Matt made our own Super Smash Bros. and Designed each characters moves and Final Smashes. Of course, the first person we made was Fawful. We put in Spongebob, his Final smash was like Donkey Kongs were he brings out his jukebox and shockwaves come out. Patrick was in it, his Final Smash was burping\u00a0:) I think Wart(From Super Mario Bros. 2) is the best character. Thats becuase I worked on him the most becuase he is my 3rd favourite Mario character(With Bowser jr. being the second, and I think you know who is the first). We made the advendure mode and the trophies and stickers!!! and we made King Julien the leader of the subspace in adventure mode and we made him the final boss. So im going on Webkinz soon. Ratfink43 If Nintendo did release Mario and Luigi 4 one day, I would reserve it the first day I hear about it. My friend James HATES Fawful, so I told him he needs to see a doctor. I mean at 12th my birthday party on June 21st My other friends and I were playing toothepaste. James topic was favourite video game character, so I said Fawful. Then after we ran James asked me If I seriously liked fawful, and he was suprised when I said yes!!!!!!!Now I almost constantly get text messages from him saying Fawful is a nutcase. I cant belive my best friend has no taste in Video game character!!!! Oh and that roller coaster idea you and Maria were doing is pretty cool, I might do that myself with my DonkeyKong stuffed animal! Ratfink43 Really? you first day of school is 2day?!

Ratfink43 Wait, how the heck did Nintendo Power review BiS if it isnt even released yet?!! Well I didnt get the new Nintendo Power yet so I really dont know. Theres a new website for BiS? What is it called? I just want to play that game already. And no, I had no idea what you meant by I HAVE CHORTNESSS!!! or whatever it was. Ratfink43 I REALLY CANT STAND IT ANYMORE!!!!!!!!! EVER SCINCE OCTOBER 2ND WHEN THIS GAME WAS ANNOUNCED I HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO PLAY THIS BECUASE NINTENDO OF AMERICA IS SO SLOW!!!!! Ughhhhhh!!! I HAVE FURY!!!!!!!!!!! GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!! I have calm. well this wiki is getting better ( I just did the Prince Peasley article) and Soon we might have 100 articles!! Ya know I really think that, in Luigis Mansion, if you get all the money and gold in the ENTIRE mansion you should be able to explore Luigis New Mansion!!!! Oh, and I sent my Fawful Mii 2 your Wii\u00a0:) Ratfink43 I know Nintendo is lazy, imean I think they literally took the japaneese box art, clicked on the japaneese writing and converted it to english(notice how Bowsers Inside Story is written in yellow like RPG 3 was written in yellow in Japaneese boxart) AND IT STINKS, LIKE A ROTTEN CHEESEBURGER SALAD IN THE BOWL OF COMPLETE DULLNESSS!!!! Yeah I know Im not that funny\u00a0:( Anyways, do you have MK DS? Ratfink43 I guess two minutes is enuff time. Anyways, funny how your good at MK Wii but not MK DS and Im the complete opposite. I beat my friends everytime (They assume I am using a cheat code\u00a0:) and think I am secretly using Action Replay) I keep trying to take a picture with my DSi with my SD card, but it always says that \"The device in the SD Card can not be used\"\u00a0:( Stupid thing, I gotta get a new one(SD Card)\u00a0:( My friend is EXCITED for school, so I told him he wuz crazy. I mean, first he says he doesent like fawful, then he says hes EXCITED 4 school!!!! His brain (or whatevers up there ) is wierd. Ya know, my mom made me study 4 my science mid term, but after about 15 minutes I got bored and started playing my DS\u00a0:) Ratfink43 I dont know ho james is Excited for school but whatever. I learned NOTHING last year in 6th grade becuase my teachers just talked about the same old stuff I learned before. When I first saw fawful I didnt hate him, I just thought he was annoying(Trapping Prince Peasley, putting a rock in the way of the path, confusing me with words I cant understand, you get the idea.) Also my DS is on Wifi so we can play MKDS some time. Do you have Donkey Kong Jungle Beat? IT IS SOO FUN!!!! Ratfink43 It is New Play control Wii, but I have The original gamcube version. I am up to the 12th world already!!!!!!! Oh, and let me tell you something, MY LITTLE COUSIN IS SUCH A BRAT!!! She messed up our basement, and I yelled at her and told her she wasnt being nice(She always says it to me now its my turn\u00a0;) ) She said she doesent care becuse its Our house and our job to clean it up. And my Mom acually did make me clean it up, so becuase of my cousins stupidness I was inturuppted from deafeting Morton Koopa Jr. in SMB3 but I was so mad I forgot to pause it so Morton killed me!!!!!! and when she slept over our house, in the middle of the night she was Screaming:\"I WANT MOMMY!!!\" ughh, she is so annoying!! >:( I HAVE FURY!!!!!!!!!!!! SO MUCH FURY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! TOO MUCH FURY!!!!!!!!!!!!! GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have calm. Ratfink43 Why is it always the cousins that anooy people? on TV shows its the brothers that are annoying, but me and my brother get along pretty well (most of the time). Oh, and the reason I wuz playing SMB3 when my cousin was over is becuase my uncle loved that game as a kid and told me to try it out. Today is the first day of September(I think) Which is a good and bad thing. Good becuse of ML: BiS. Bad becuase of school. Ratfink43 I always have themes stuck in my head. I like video game soundtracks, but my mom doesent. She says its too repetitive or something. My brothers take REALLY long turns on the Wii and I barley get to play. At least they cant stop me from playing BiS becuase its on DS. But once NSMBWii comes out I am gonna start taking REALLY long turns. Ratfink43 I see. So, you have the Wii 2 yourself? Lucky. It is September 4th so BIs comes out soon. But not soon enough. I WISH I HAD THAT GAME NOW!!!! Ratfink43 Also I got a new SD card so I will send u pics soon. Me and my brother learned to put the homebrew channel on our Wii but I really dont see the point of doing that. Ratfink43 I have been pretty busy getting my school stuff together and all, I cant belive school is starting the day after 2marow!! I have been trying to beat ML: SS (for the fifth time) b4 school, but I dont think thats happining. Ratfink43 Ughhhhhhhhhhhh. Today was my first day of school. it stunk. First of all my locker is a million miles away from my homeroom. But then I figure out my locker is BROKEN(wont open). And I left my backpack in school. SCHOOL WAS 2 CONFUSING!!! I HAVE FURY!!!!!!!!!! Ratfink43] Havent seen the BiS commercial yet, I might look it up on youtube. Also that cat video is SOOOO Cool!!!! And BiS comes out in 4 Days. YAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Ratfink43 YAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh, and you know whats wierd? when I got off the bus, the Rain had FURY. But now it isnt raining at all( as soon as I step in the house:) ) BiS was all I can think about in school today, which is bad becuase my Spanish teacher was telling us about some sort of project but I wasnt paying attention\u00a0:( So on monday I have to ask her. Ratfink43 By the time u read this u will be back from the camping thingamagig. Well, gamestop told me they WILL be delaying BiS until September 15. Dang. The reason I dont have so much fury is becuase its only 1 day. If it was delayed until next week or something, I would be madder than i ever was b4. I want this game NOW. But I guess I have 2 wait. At least we dont live in Europe, they dont get it till Oct. 9th. But in Japan This game is OLD!!!! JAPANEESE PEOPLE PROBOBLY BEAT IT 3 TIMES ALREADY!!!!!!!! Ratfink43 I want This game RIGHT THIS SECOND!!!!!!!!!!!! I HAVE FURY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh, well. I can still talk 2 u when I get BIS even though I will be playing that game 24/7. Ratfink43 Today is Sept 15 so I will be going to gamestop soon! I CANT WAIT!!!!!! I HAVE HAPPY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Ratfink43 THIS GAME IS SOOO FUN!!!!! IM GONNA PLAY RITE NOW!!!!! BYE 4 NOW!!!!!! Ratfink43 Im up 2 the part where you go back into Bowser to chase durmite becuase he/she has a star cure.Ratfink43 Hey, dont you think its pretty awesome when u fight Bowser 4 the second time? its kinda fun cuz youve just been playin as him and he uses moves like Goomba storm and punch. I just think its pretty dang Awesome. I just beat the Fawful express!!! Giant Bowser is SOOOOO FUN!!!!!!!!!!! THE WHOLE GAME IS PURE AWE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Ratfink43 WHY R U TRYING TO TAKE A WHILE OFF? THAT GAME IS SOOOO DANG AWESOME!!!!!!!!!! I fought the Shroobs!!!! there in Bowsers Castle. The code to open the door is square twice, circle once, and triangle 3 times. Now Im goin to Peaches Castle!!!! BYE UNTIL LATER!!!!!!! Ratfink43 I still didnt beat it yet (Im up to where you chase the Fawful Copters) But I will probobly beat it today. The next new Mario game is M&S at the Olympic Winter Games so Im getting that next, but I also want NSMBWii. Ratfink43 I got all 3 of them. The first one was Magikoopa mob, second was some kind of new gear. I AM SO CLOSE @ BEATIN THIS GAME!!!!! By the way, why dont you replay the game while waiting for Mario Galaxy 2? Ratfink43 P.S did u find the Shroobs? I acually Just beat it now. I beat the Final Boss in only 2 tries. Thats dissapointing, as Cackletta soul took me about 20 tries and it took me so many tries 2 beat Elder Princess Shroob I lost count after 40!!!! Well Maybe its becuase I was a little kid... Anyway, I tried wrestling with my friends on the trampoline today, but they are complete pussycats. We made a rule where if you hang on to the pole no one can attack you and they hung on 3/4 of the tme! And when they DID get off I tackled them easily. They are Beefless. Lacking in Beef\u00a0:) Maybe they just werent trying. My friend started making a \"Total Nintendo Island\" Comic book, but...... I think he will just get bored. My other friend is really bad at BiS. He was stuck on Midbus and I had 2 beat it for him. HOW PATHETIC!!!!!!!!! Ratfink43 That reminds me, the new SD card dosent work. So I called Nintendo and guess what? I wuz using the wrong type of SD card da whole time!!!! Now I have 2 get a new 1, AGAIN!!! Also I looked up Chortles in the dictionary, Its a type of laughter. I wuz just dissapointed that Fawful only said \"I HAVE FURY\" 2 times in BiS and Only said Fink Rat once. Oh, and Dont u think the snack basket is more of a Bros. Move then Bros. Item? Think about it, an Bros. Items u gotta press A and B when you land on an enemy, kick a shell, you know what I mean. In Bros. Moves u press the button 2 make Mario/Luigi do something, and Mario has 2 press A a lot to lift Luigi and Luigi Presses B to Ground Pound.(Funny if u spell Luigi a certain amount of times it looks like its spelled wrong...) Ratfink43 Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi(see wat I mean?) DONT SEND ANYTHING TO MY WII!!!!!!!!!!!! Becuase They got dissconected from the Internet so I need 2 Reconnect it but my brother is playing the Wii right now. Ill tell ya when you can. I just started my second File of BiS yesterday, and Im already up 2 the part Where you get outta Bowser!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Probobly becuase it wuz raining yesterday and I had nothin else 2 do. I guess Fawful was questioning his Awesome Fury becuase He just got beat up by Bowser and Hes a tiny bug now. Ratfink43 Man, I did NOT wanna get up this moring. Im not a morning person(unless Im in bed) and I just didnt feel like doing stuff after a 3 day weekend. I cant get my Wii fixed till tommorow becuase 2day I cant turn the Wii on AT ALL!!! so bizzare but Dad said it should work tommorow Ratfink43Hi  Fawfulfury, do you have Mario and Luigi 3? Because if you do, that article could use some editing...or a LOT of editing. Do you know anyone who might be interested in joining this wiki? Please ask them if you do. I am going to the Mario Wiki next to see if I can find anyone. This wiki hasn't seen much improvement. I think we really need to get some more editors. Thank you. Shadow34 Shadow, Don't Worry! I got it covered! anyway, How is it? --G00mba 15:32, January 1, 2010 (UTC)Tell me about it  My S.S teacher gave me a project about some columbian exchange or something. Some idiots took my jacket on the bus 2day and I had 2 get it back. Mr. Szabo(Orchestra teacher) said when you come in you cant talk, \"even though it goes against our nature\". Guess what, Mr. Szabo, SCHOOL GOES AGAINST MY NATURE!!!! MY NATURE IS VIDEO GAMES AND SPORTS!!!!!!!!!!!!! Mostly video games but u get the point.Ratfink43Hi  Well, thanks. By the way, if you see any vandalism, delete it. I made the unfortunate mistake of telling my friend about this site, and so he decided to vandalize my talk page. I blocked his computer, but be on the lookout for him (the block was only for an hour). Anyway, be sure to check out the rules page so you know how to dish out punishments. If you don't know how to block users, tell me. Thanks again. - Shadow34hi  Hi Fawfulfury65, its Cmario17.\n Thanks for recommending me to this wiki. You were right when you said it needed help. I'll try to fix it up when I can.\n I've already made adjustments to the Bowser, Mario, and Koopalings articles.Hi  Do you have Mario and Luigi: Partners in Time? - Shadow34 I just edited the Koopalings article!! So I kinda forgot my Wii needs fixing so Ill do That right now(or after Im done with my Homework)Ratfink43 I wish there were a M&L 10!!!! but I dont think thats happening. Fawful could be like on a flag or poster or something in M&S at the Olympic Winter Games but I doubt it. Im confused\u00a0%( Ya wanna know whats the most annoying thing in ML: PiT? BABY PEACHES CRYING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I SWEAR IF I HEAR IT ONE MORE TIME I WILL VOMITT ON ROTTEN CASHEWS!!!!!\u00a0:) Ratfink43 P.S Do u think BiS was worth the wait? I mean it was an awesome game and I loved it but was it really worth an 11 month wait? I HAVE FAWFUL TODAY!!!!!!! I dont think I told you but some days I just am so hyper and estatic. I call it \"The days I have FAWFUL!!! AND BOY DO I HAVE FAWFUL 2DAY!!!!!!!!!!!! IM BOUNCING IN MY COMPUTER SEAT RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!! I feel so happy when I Have Fawful and my friends like me better when I have Fawful becuase Im more fun. WHY AM I SITTING RIGHT NOW?? I SHOULD BE OUT WITH MT FRIENDS PLAYING FAWFUL FOOTBALL!!! ( its a game we made up) SEE YA 2MARROW!!!!!!!Ratfink43 P.S the bad part about me having fawful is the very next day I am absoloutely Pooped(Tired). P.S.S Now I realize BiS was DEFINETLY WORTH THE WAIT!!!!!! Today Im going 2 the zoo. Usually I would try to play video games b4 I go but now idc becuse its a 3 day weekend!!! I want NSMBWii so much becuase BiS is starting (ONLY STARTING) to get a little boring, but it is still REALLY super duper fun, but playing it 4 the 5th time isint as good as playing it 4 the first time. Whats wierd is I kinda saw BiS and SMG2 coming, i mean how Fawful said he will make a comeback in PiT and in SMG Rosalina said the cycle never repeats itself in the sameway , But NSMBWii was an absolute surprise. Well, on Friday my friend asked me a question that really got my attention. He was all \"If you HAD to go out with somone in the Mushroom Kingdom or any video game, who would it be?\" I was all\"Do you have feelings for the characters cuz even Im not that obsessed\". But If I did, I guess I would have 2 pick Starlow, Shes kinda cool. But then my friend Micheal said IKE!!!!! 0_0 IKE IS A BOY, YOU IDIOT MICHEAL!!!!!!! So who would you go out wit(not that I expct you to have feelings 4 the characters, thats just dumb.Ratfink43Templates  Oops! I forgot all about those. I'll work on them soon. Have you seen the new Q&A page? I think it helps improve the scope of this wiki. - Shadow34 Ive seen both of the Toy Storys but I dont remember what happens becuase I was a little kid. So about your brother bringing the GC controllers 2 college, why dont u just buy new ones? oh wait that would be a waist of money. So what are you doing? Ratfink43 I have all the Diary of a wimpy kids except 4 dog days. I really think that MS at the OWG will be fun but I want the DS version becuse of adventure mode. I really think NSMBWii will be better then MS: OWG and Maybe even BiS. I acually just relized that Mario and Sonic at the Olympic winter games just came out yesterday!!! I JUST REALIZED THAT NOW!!! I HAVE STUPIDITY!! (Or is it forgetfullness) Ratfink43Merging  Fawfulfury, good news: we will be merging with the Partners in Time wiki. We will be bigger and better than ever before! - Shadow34 Yeah, Ill check out the DK racing article. But I would never underestimate a sequel to a terrible original(BiS was 20x better than PiT) But NSMB has absolutley no replay value, and the final boss is ridiculasley easy.Ratfink43 Who cares about the story? in those kinds of games, story doesent matter(I was acually surprised to see Bowser Jr., I thought Hed be replaced by the Koopalings.) Well theres nothing 4 me 2 do right now and Im bored. I want it 2 be tommorow becuase tommorow is Friday and on Friday my mom lets me have all my friends over 2 play Fawful Football. Maybe 2marow we can play MK Wii becuase I alredy have your number and I think you have Mine. Ratfink43Q & A  Fawfulfury65, do you have any idea who deleted the Mario and Luigi Wiki:Questions and Answers page that I made? I couldn't find it anywhere in the wikis history. Also, it had to have been an administrator or bureaucrat, as no one else has the authority to delete those pages. - Shadow34 Acually its gotta be tommorow becuase I was out all day today. I edited the Dark Fawful article so check it out sometime!!! Pretty soon, this wiki will be looking good\u00a0;) Ratfink43 O.K. So at Fridat at 4:00 Iwill go on. Do you know my Friend code? Idunno If I gave you mine.Just check and make sure this way I can give it to you before we play. So did you see that new Spongebob episode where they got turned into ghosts? I didnt so if you saw it plz tell me about it. Alrighty, Bye.Ratfink43 Hey Im friends with Ratfink43 Im hoping to be good friends with you!!!!!Wait your a fawful fan?????Me two!!!!!Do you have Mario and Luigi Bowsers Inside story???????Let me know!!!!!! YoshiFawful112 HAHAHHAHAHA NO YOUR NOT!!!!!!!!Yeah I am friends with Ratfink43!!!!!!Yes I do have Wi-Fi!!!!I know Ratfink43 in real life and he told me that on Friday you guys are Playing Mario Kart Wii at 4:00 and he invited me to play withn you guys!!!!!!Is that ok!!!!!! HAHAHHAHAHA NO YOUR NOT!!!!!!!!Yeah I am friends with Ratfink43!!!!!!Yes I do have Wi-Fi!!!!I know Ratfink43 in real life and he told me that on Friday you guys are Playing Mario Kart Wii at 4:00 and he invited me to play withn you guys!!!!!!Is that ok!!!!!! YoshiFawful112DS  Fawfulfury, did you hear about that new DSi LL they're releasing, with screens that are 4.2 inches diagonally? You know, that really irritates me, because I just HAVE to have the latest system! Oh well...\u00a0: ) - Shadow34 Ok ummmmmm just one question!!!!!!!How do you figure out your code because I dont know what mine is and how to get it!!!!!Can you plz tell me? YoshiFawful112 Heyy Ummmm Actually You dont need my friend code because Im going to Nicks house in real life and We are both going to vs. you on his wii!!!!!!!Yeah so see you at 4:00!!!!!! YoshiFawful112 Hahahahahaha you beat us both!!!But I beat Nick evrey single time he always came in last and I always cam 2nd!!!!Good Game!!!!!!!!Maybe we can play again sometime!!!!=) YoshiFawful112DS  Yeah, you're right. We do need articles on things like Nintendo and the Nintendo DS. Also, do you have any interest in being a bureaucrat? (in case you're wondering, Hunter Neb is the bureaucrat of the Partners in Time wiki, and since we are merging (eventually) I promised him that he would become a bureaucrat too). Oh, and we've reached our 100th article, by the way. I also have a favor to ask you: can you start simply beginning articles, and maybe lay out the sections? I've been doing this, and it's a hard job for just one person...speaking of which, we need more users... - Shadow34Hi  The rules page was deleted too?! You're kidding. I can't believe that these pages are being deleted without a trace. I can't find any evidence of anyone who could have done it. I also can't find any deletions of any pages in anyone's user contribution history (except for mine), so this is quite baffling. But what mystifies me even more is that there is no record whatsoever of these pages ever existing on this whole wiki. I can only think of two explanations for these disappearances: The problem with wiki cleanups is that all administrators are notified beforehand. But if it is hacking or sockpuppetry, there is no evidence. This is quite a mystery... Oh, and thank you for starting the Nintendo DS and Nintendo DSi XL articles. And don't be afraid to add articles on the most minor and unimportant things, like the Spiky Stardust Defense System in Superstar Saga or the Mega Mushroom that Broque Monsieur uses in Bowser's Inside Story. This place needs to be the ULTIMATE resource database for Mario and Luigi knowledge-and we are getting there! - Shadow34 Well that was awesome(apparently I gotta practice at Mario Kart) I got like 500000000000000 pieces of candy on Halloween! Its awesome. Okay, so if the dark star is our 100th article, ill try to make it the best it can be. I will also tell Yoshifawful112. Bye! Ratfink43 Its Ok I dont blame ya!!!!!!That was fun though!!!!!But just be warned!!!!!!I have been practicing so when we play again prepare to get creamed!!!!Oh and Nick tole me your name is Maura well Im James if you didnt know!!!!! YoshiFawful112 Heyyyy!!!!!!YEAH!!!!!!!!Ok tomorrow I will give you my M.K(Mario Kart) Wiki Code!!!!!!I couldnt before because I lost my game LOL but now I found it and now my brother is bugging me to go on the computer so I cant give it now!!!!I will Give it tomorrow!!!!And F.Y.I You dont know but I DIDNT BEAT BOWSERS INSIDE STORY YET AND I GOT IT THE FIRST DAY IT CAME OUT!!!!!!LOL!!!!!Im mad but Im sooo close im just about to enter Peaches Castle!!!!!!!!!!O AND I know this is random but.............YOSHI AND FAWFUL RULE!!!!!!!!!!!HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!Ok right back!!!!!!!!See you later.................Unconsious(Falls Down) I hope they make a Sequal To BIS!!!!!!Yeah!!!!!! Hahahaha alright Bye!!!! Write back!!!!!! YoshiFawful112 So you play basketball as well? Thats so Awesome!!!!!!!!!! I love to play basketball and play with my friends all the time(In between Fawful football) Although I didnt have my 1st practice yet:( As for ML: 4, just email Nintendo saying you absolutley LOVED ML:BiS and you would love to see a sequel! Tell everyone to do this to!!!!! Honestly, EVERYONE YOU KNOW!!! If we get enuff people, Nintendo will realize their fans want a sequel and they will make a lot of money and possibly make the sequel!!!! But dont do that right now, wait a little while becuase Nintendo is busy enuff with NSMBWii and SMG2. Do you have Mario Hoops 3-on-3? I dont remember if that game is wi-fi. Oh well. BYE UNTIL............................................NEXT TIME I TALK 2 YOU WHICH WILL BE................................... WHEN U REPLY 2 ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Ratfink43 Hmmmm, OK. I really am bored, ive been bored latley. Ive heard of Chck Norris, but, I dunno(I dont care that im not making sense). (Sigh) I want to do something. Maybe I will just play Super Mario World. Have you ever played that game? Im up 2 the dangerous yet tasty chocolate Island. I wish there was a SMW sequel!!!!I Wish there were ML:4,5,6,7,8,9,and even10!!! HOPEFULLY IT WILL HAPPEN!! Well, 4 now I should be happy I have BiS, becuase I was so excited b4 it came out and I didnt start my 3rd playthrough yet. Im also still trying to beat challenge hall(STUPID BOWSER X!!!BOWSER X IS THE HARDEST BOSS EVAR!!!Ratfink43 I just had a wierd dream too!!! and so did my other friend Alex, AND MATT!!!! Looks like all my friends had weird dreams recently!!!!! OK, in my dream Donkey Kong and King Kong were Fighting (DK had a Mega Mushroom) They were duking it out in N.Y.C, and I saw the whole thing, and DK won in the end!!!!!!!!!!!!! I wish DK was in the M&L seiries.Ratfink43 Hahaha yeah I know Freaky.........And I did dream you like that because I saw a pic of you at Nicks house on his wii.......I will give you my Codes another time cause Im having a sleepover with Nick and Yes I have The Nintendo Channel......Why?????? YoshiFawful112 Mario is the best, NSMBWii is gonna be the awesomist game EVER! Whoever thinks Mario is stupid is DEAD WRONG!!!! However, dont get me wrong, but I want MW2. Yeah, you might hate me for saying this, but I am a big fan of Call of Duty series. My other friend is really good at it and he is already up to the Natzi Zombies, but when he first told me that im like, \"What the heck does that mean!\" I guess I like those games becuase I like to shoot down my own men:) Its SOOOOOOOOO funny!!!! But regardless, going around killing people can get boring, and Mario NEVER gets boring. At my school, people are going around saying that Halo is better than Call of Duty AND Mario COMBINED!!! I told that kid Mario alone beats Halo . He said Mario is kiddish but what the heck does HE know!!! MARIO RULES OVER ALL!!!!!(except fawful)Ratfink43 Ratfink43, Good news for you! Fawfulfury is on your side! Hey FawfulFury, You hate the Halo Series right... And If you want me to know where I got that, I Have my sources... User:G00mbaNintendo DSi XL  Are you planning on getting the new DSi? I am. - Shadow34 My 4-year-old brother is afraid of the void!!!!!!! What the heck is animusic? I just beat Super Mario World yesterday. Yoshi's babies are so funny!! They look all cuddly and the way they move is very cool!! By the way, can you do the jerk? How bout the spongebob?Ratfink43Improvement  Great ideas, Fawfulfury65. I started with changing the featured article (although I still think Fawful is WAY cooler) to Luigi. - Shadow34Oops  Sorryfor writing back a LOT late, but I had So much stuff to do. I just came back from my friends house and now I dont know what else to say. Bye. Ratfink43 Lucky I dont have the game yet!!!!!!!!And no I dont watch the thingy on the nintendo Channel YoshiFawful112 Do you have NSMBW? I dont. I want it so bad but my mom said that i have to wait till Christmas EVEN THOUGH I HAVE ENOUGH MONEY!!! I HAVE FURY! Ratfink43 I am getting it over the Thanksgiving break. Ive played it at my friends house before but that was only for world 3-2 and for the World 6 air ship. Bowser is so stupid. Why the heck dose he put buttons at the end of his bridges that remove him? What, does he just like random buttons? Ratfink43 HAPPY TURKEY DAY!Ratfink43Templates  Well, we need templates for stubs and articles with incomplete sections. For now, those would be great starts. Oh, and please start making new articles; just lay out the overview, and put in sections. That encourages people to actually work on articles...I've started the vast majority of the articles myself. - Shadow34 Categories appear to be redlinks because articles on them haven't been written (all the articles in the category appear there regardless, though). - Shadow34 Yes. But it will take a while. - User:Shadow34User Boxes  Hey, Fawfulfury, I just found out that you can make userboxes on this wiki! Made any yet?\u00a0: ) - Shadow34 If you want to make userbox templates, I suggest you go here. - Shadow34It's a-me, Pie Shroom!  Yep. It's Pie Shroom from the mariowiki.... and I need help. Whenever I try to create a wikia account it says \"We are unable to register you at this time.\" What should I do? 24.123.0.130 05:00, December 5, 2009 (UTC) Sweeeeeeet. Thanks\u00a0:) -Chortles Master1029Mariowiki  Ok, calm down now. Breathe in. Breathe out. I can get on fine.. so why?....... Y'know what? When in doubt, clear your cache. That's my techno-motto. Chortles Master1029User Boxes  Did you use the link I put above (under the Userboxes section) and make any userboxes yet? - Shadow34 Yea Heyy I forgot all about this website.....u wanna know what sucks so bad????????? I STILL DONT HAVE NEW SUPER MARIO BROS WII AND I AM SOOOOO ANGRY!!!!!!!! =( I HAVE TO WAIT A WEEK FROM NOW UNTIL CHRISTMAS!!!!.................hopefully!!!!!!! YoshiFawfule112Hiya  Guess who beat NSMB Wii today! Bowser was way to easy. The level before you fight Bowser, is so easy, it should be the FIRST castle, not the last! But the World 8 Airship was SO HARD! But fighting Bowser Jr. was easy. Now I have all Star cions in W1!!Ratfink43 I updated it and my Wii didnt break. I got M&S at the OWG for wii. So far my fav. event is Dream Snowboard Cross. I also got Wii point cards and FINALLY downloaded Yoshi's Story! I wanted that game for a while. AND I ALREADY BEAT IT! I BEAT IT IN HALF AN HOUR! Not becuase I used a warp, it's becuase The game has only a few easy peasy worlds and easy peasy bosses. The final Boss, Baby Bowser, was impossible to lose cuz the Super Happy Tree is RIGHT THERE and it restores your HP. YOSHI RULES! When I beat NSMBW I was playing with my friend and my 2 brothers (my sister was at dance lessons or whatever.) I hit the first switch that removes the bridge. However, my friend and 2 Brothers were still on the Bridge! It was so funny as Bowser, Blue Toad, Yellow Toad, and Luigi fell into the lava XD!!! Good thing THEY didnt turn giant. My friend told me, as we were fleeing form Bowzilla(My nickname for giant Bowser) that Bowser turning Giant was a reference to Bowser's Inside Story. I guess He was trying to show me that he knew a lot about Mario. All it DID show me, is that he never played Yoshi's Island XD!! Whew, I sure wrote a lot! Im gonna go Play Rabbids Go Home now!( I got that for Christmas too!) BYE! Ratfink43New Super Mario Bros. Wii  Do you have New Super Mario Bros. Wii yet? I do, and so far, I've beaten every level up to mid-World 6. I also have all the Star Coins so far...! (but I can't take all the credit though, it would have been nearly so easy if I didn't get the Prima guide of the game.) So anyway, how many templates have you designed yet? I keep seeing new ones all the time. Thanks! - Shadow34Where is everybody?  Do you know what is going on with all our users? No one is editing any more!--Shadow34 Yeah, we need more users.

It was released in Japan on February 11, 2009, in the United States on September 14, 2009, in Europe on October 9, 2009, and October 22, 2009 in the PAL region.Story  All around the Mushroom Kingdom, Toads begin to fall victim to the mysterious Blorbs. Mario and Luigi, of course, are called into action, and along with their new friend Starlow set off to find the cure, however they are swallowed by Bowser after he eats an item called a Vacuum Mushroom, which was given to him by Fawful. Bowser is the third playable character, and he sets out on a journey to defeat Fawful and reclaim his castle, however is unaware that he ate Mario and Luigi. Bowser arrives at Plack Beach. Bowser meets Broque Monseir, a famous block collector, who is trapped on an island. He tells Bowser he helps him, he will give him a Vacuum Block. With the Mario Bros' help, he is able to pull the island and rescue Broque Monseir. Bowser then comes across the Sea Pipe Statue and battles it. With the Vacuum Block and the Mario Bros' help, he is to beat it. The statue spews water, Bowser drinks the water allowing Mario and Luigi to enter the Pump Works and find a special attack called Fire Flower. With Bowser's cooperation, they access to the Flame Pipe. Mario and Luigi realize the reason Bowser can't breathe fire was because Scutlet was blocking the flames. They defeat the bug, allowing Bowser to breathe fire. Bowser asks Starlow her name, Starlow (not wanting Bowser to know Mario and Luigi are in his body) tells her name is Chippy. Bowser meets Broque Monsier again this time looking for his pet, Broggy. Broggy attacks them. Bowser bests him with his fire and shell defense. Bowser heads to Dimble Wood and meets Broque Monsier again in his shop with Broggy. They sell Bowser items and gear. Broque Monsier asks Bowser to bring him fifthteen Blitties and he will be given the Broggy Bonker. Bowser find his Goomba Corps stuffed in a cage by Fawful. Bowser frees them. Then, a Fawful Copter appears and Fawful\u00a0tells Bowser that he scattered his minions through the Kingdom. Bowser sees three of his minions, Private Goomp, Seargent Guy, and\u00a0Parapalaponk. The three are trying to retake Bowser Castle by firing a\u00a0Banzai Bill at the castle, but are low on ammo. Bowser goes looking for a Banzai Bill. He arrives at the Wiggler Farm and finds the Giga Carrott and pulls it. The Wiggler gaurding it tells him he has a Banzai Bill and will give him it if he eats the all of the Giga Carrott. Bowser succeeds, but the Wiggler forgets the bet and is angry that Bowser soiled the Wigglers' hard work that he battles Bowser. Bowser bests him.\u00a0 The Wiggler gives Bowser the Banzai Bill. But\u00a0Bowser gets a belly ache, so Mario and Luigi go to the Nerve Cluster to find whats giving Bowser the painful aches. The brothers find that Durmite is the one causing the tremors and defeat it. They find Toadbert who finds a switch that gives Bowser\u00a0the sliding haymaker. Bowser loads the cannan. But Fawful's brawny minion, Midbus has the castle lifted into the sky to Dimble Wood. Bowser gets crushed underneath his own castle. Mario and Luigi go to the Rump Command to revive his body. Bowser grows big and battles his castle. After the fight, he heads for his castle. On the way to Bowser Castle, Bowser frees his Shy Guy Squad. Midbus, however, lifts the castle again. Bowser comes to cliff and throws a iron ball and his castle crashes back to it's original place. When Bowser arrives at his castle, he realizes Fawful actually turned his castle into Fawful Theater and also brainwashed his minions. After looking around the theater, the show is about to start. Bowser sees all the seats are taken and complains to manager, but he is given the VIP seat. Fawful launches Bowser on stage where he fights Midbus in a cage fight. After the KO Midbus is dragged away, Bowser demands his castle back from Fawful, but Fawful tricks Bowser into eat a buffet of Bowser's favorite (yet unhealthy, greasy, and sweet) foods. Bowser becomes fat and chubby after the Boos\u00a0fed him so much food. Mario and Luigi venture into the Flab Zone, marking it the perfect oppurtunity to look for Princess Peach. However, the bros manage to\u00a0find Peach, but the princess is taken by Alpha Kreta, so the Mario Bros. give chase. Mario and Luigi find a new special\u00a0attack called Jump Helmet and a new move, Spin Jump, and Badges. Mario and Luigi rescues Peach and defeat Alpha Kreta. Before celebrating, the bros, Peach, and Starlow realizes that they have another problem: they have to find a way to escape Bowser's body. Fawful uses a ray gun remove Peach from Bowser's body. Fawful's real plan is revealed, he is after the Dark Star which is\u00a0sealed\u00a0under Toad Town and he\u00a0needs\u00a0Princess Peach to awaken it.. Despite their efforts, Peach is captured and is removed from Bowser's body and carried away while unconcious(for the whole game until she is rescued) by Fawful. Midbus places a treadmill under Bowser to burn off fat. Bowser, covered\u00a0in flames, heads to a crate of Bomb-Ombs and (accidently) lits one up which lits the others, resolting in a huge explosion, flinging Bowser out of his castle into a underground tunnel in Cavi Cape. Bowser finds his Monty Mole Bros. digging a secret escape tunnel he told them to build to Toad Town. After finish digging, he arrives at Toad Caves which is under Toad Town. He goes into a building and triggers the security system and is zapped unconious. Mario and Luigi go to the Pipe Yard which is filled with pipes Bowser enhaled and find themselves outside Bowser's body. Just then, they hear Fawful's voice. Mario and Luigi decide to find Dark Star before their psychotic enemy. Mario and Luigi find a block and strike it and find it full of shells. Three friendly blue Paratroopas teach them how to use a shell and also give them a new attack pieces called Yoo Hoo Cannan. Mario and Luigi find the room where the the Dark Star is, but the Toads guarding it can't let them in. But then, they are actually Fawful's minions. The bros are too late to stop Fawful. Fawful heads over to Peach's Castle with the Dark Star. A Toad tells Starlow and the plumbers to head Fawful at Peach's Castle. Mario and Luigi are about to enter the castle\u00a0when a barrier blocks the castle entrance. Mario and Luigi head over to Dr. Toadley's Clinic. The Mario Bros. trick the intern into thinking they are coming down with the Blorbs.Gameplay  Mario and Luigi travel in a 2-D traditional platforming game inside Bowser, while Bowser explores a 3-D overworld. The Mario Bros. are controlled by the A and B buttons, while Bowser is controlled by the X and Y buttons.Battle  Like in the other Mario and Luigi games, the game is an RPG and the players will take turns using various attacks. The key to the series battle system is to have good timed hits such as pressing the A or B button when landing on an enemy, getting an better attack rating.Locations Characters Playable Non-Playable Enemies  Please see List of Enemies in Mario and Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story.Reception  Mario and Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story receved a 35/40 by Famitsu and sold 650,000 copies in Japan in the first half of 2009. The game was on the #1 spot on the bestsellers list for a long time in Japan. Nintendo Power also gave Mario and Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story a 9.5 out of 10. In general, the game has received very positive reviews.Trivia Mario  Mario is a famous hero, older brother of Luigi, and star of the Mario & Luigi Series.History Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga  After Princess Peach's voice gets stolen by Cackletta and her assistant, Fawful, Mario leaves with\u00a0Bowser to get it back. Bowser flies Mario, and picks up Luigi while taking off. They set course for the Beanbean Kingdom, but Fawful attacks the Koopa Cruiser and Mario and Luigi fall into Stardust Fields. When Mario and Luigi travel to Little Fungitown, they win an Invincishroom in an arcade game. Mario eats it and gets Bean Fever from not being used to the food in the area. Luigi went off by himself to find Crabby Grass, the only known cure. Luigi succeeded and Mario recovered. Mario also separated from Luigi for a while to solve the puzzles of Jokes End. After Fawful steals the Beanstar from them, Mario disguises Luigi as Princess Peach to trick Bowletta. Mario and Luigi defeat all of the Koopalings, Bowletta, as well as Cackletta's Soul in Bowser's Castle and are last seen in the game on an airplane going back to the Mushroom Kingdom.Mario and Luigi: Partners in Time  For more information see Baby Mario. In Mario and Luigi: Partners in Time, Mario and Luigi accidentally travel back in time. They soon meet an alien race called the Shroobs, and are defeated by them. However, Baby Mario and Baby Luigi found them and decided to save them. Mario and Luigi then travel together with their past selves to save the Mushroom Kingdom of the past. Mario is never separated from Luigi in this game, but the babies are required to go off on their own every so often.Mario and Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story  After a a disease called the Blorbs spreads across the Mushroom Kingdom, Princess Peach calls a meeting to discuss the matter. Mario and [[Luigi] show up a little bit late, but not too late. During the meeting, Luigi quickly falls asleep while Mario listens intently. Bowser soon arrives and attempts to steal Peach, but Mario defeats him easily. Peach and Starlow drop Bowser into Dimble Wood, and the meeting is assumed to continue until Bowser returns and vacuums everyone up. Bowser then faints, and does not remember anything vacuuming anyone up. Mario falls into the Trash Pit and begins to search for the others. He saves Starlow first, and they find Luigi a little later. The bros. continue and find Hammers, and their first special attack - the Green Shell. Both of these new abilites are quickly used, but the bros. triumphantly exit the Trash Pit - they find an area where they can buy things from the Toads Bowser inhaled. Another area an exposed nerve - Mario hits it twice with his Hammer, and revives Bowser. Starlow also alerts Bowser that he has a guest. If the bros. return to this area later, the nerve is healed over and cannot be re-whacked. Having woken up, Bowser stomps through Cavi Cape, and arrives at Plack Beach. There, he saves Broque Monsieur and earns a Vacuum Block. When Bowser inhales Broque, he finds the Mario bros. and explains how the battle will switch to them. Broque then exits Bowser - but does not mention the Mario bros. to Bowser. When Bowser fights the Stone Blooper Statue later on the beach, the bros. must do most of the damage to the Stone Blooper. Afterward, Mario and Luigi travel to the Pump Works and earn the Fire Flower Special Attack. Luigi also learns to shrink Mario with his Hammer. Afterward, Mario and Luigi enter the Flame Pipe - to find that a large Scutlet is blocking Bowser's flames. The enemy eats Starlow, then battles Mario and Luigi. After a tough battle, Starlow is saved and Bowser can use his Fire Breath again. Bowser also requests the name of the person inside of him, and Starlow quickly replies \"CHIPPY!\" Bowser refers to Chippy whenever he needs the bros. (who he doesn't know are helping him). Bowser continues onward to Dimble Wood, crushing everything in his path (as usual). Mario and Luigi help Bowser digest a Giga-Carrot from the Gut Check station, and defeat Durmite after it causes Bowser pain. Bowser is also crushed by his own castle, and the bros. must ford his adrenaline channel in the Rump Command area to revive him. However, Bowser's adrenaline is special somehow - it not only saves him, but also makes him huge. After pummeling his castle into retreating, Bowser shrinks - and continues onward to regain his castle. The bros. don't do too much on the path to Bowser's Castle. Bowser does most of the pummeling, as most of the enemies are Chain Chawfuls - which are too big to vacuum up. After entering his castle and defeating Midbus again, Bowser eats too much and gets stuck in the floor. Mario and Luigi enter the Flab Zone, where they fight mini-meats (Tenderlings) and vicious burning things (Calorites). The Attack pieces the bros. find here earn them the Jump Helmet, which comes not a moment too soon. Mario also learns to initiate the Spin Jump, which also becomes highly useful. After venturing deep into the flab, Mario and Luigi find Princess Peach - but she is taken away by a large amount of Beta Kretins. The bros. persue the mob until it stops - then they knock all the little particles off using a Spin Jump. However, they come back and merge into the powerful Alpha Kretin - which scares Luigi very much. After a long and difficult battle, the bros. are victorious - but they have still not found a way out of Bowser. While they search a little farther, Princess Peach tells the bros. about Fawful's plan to get the Dark Star before she is extracted from Bowser's body - by Fawful. This causes Bowser to lose just enough weight to fall the rest of the way through the floor and burn off (literally!) those extra calories. Bowser is then blown out of his castle and lands in an underground tunnel. Once again, the bros. don't do much - the only enemies here are big Choombas and little Coalbits. There are a lot of Coalbits (3-5 per battle), so the bros. can gain some good experience. Bowser eventually finds some Monty Moles - and decides to speed up their progress by pushing a drill through some really hard dirt. Bowser cannot accomplish this task without the bros., who report to Bowser's leg muscles. Bowser breaks through to Toad Town Underground - but shortly afterward is electrocuted into submission. The bros. find an exit in Bowser's Pipe Yard at long last. Mario and Luigi explore the Toad Town Underground, as they try to find the Dark Star before Fawful does! While searching, the bros. find a pipe that leads them outside. The bros. use wind currents to fly way up into the sky - where they find a giant shell block. Mario hits it, and many little Shell Blocks fly out, landing all over the Mushroom Kingdom. Three Paratroopas confront Mario and Luigi, and force Mario to try wearing a shell. The shell fits perfectly, and Luigi hits Mario with his Hammer - knocking the paratroopas in mid-air. Surprised by the bros. ability to adapt, the paratroopas decide to let the bros. slide on this one - and give them 10 more Attack Pieces. The Mario bros. learn the Yoo Who Cannon attack, and using Mario's new shell ability gets the bros. to the entrance of the Dark Star's location. The guard Toads seem a little suspicious, and it is revealed that they are Fawful's minions. Mario and Luigi arrive just in time to see Fawful steal the Dark Star. After Fawful leaves, Mario and Luigi use a pipe to reach Toad Town. They attempt to enter Peach's Castle, but the Dark Star creates several walls that the bros. cannot break. Upon returning to Toad Town, the bros. find that a new mall has opened - Mario and Luigi enter to find Dr. Toadley's clinic, where they fake symptoms of the blorbs to get an appointment. Dr. Toadley announces that the bros. actually have a grave disease - Bowseritis. As if on cue, Bowser appears and battles the bros. - unaware that they have been helping him all along. Bowser is defeated, and Dr. Toadley proceeds to tell all three heroes about the three Star Cures. Dr. Toadley reaveals that the first start sgae is in Dimble Wood, and Bowser rushes off. The Mario Bros. recognize the Star Sage as Durmite - the worm that Bowser ate in the giant carrot. Mario and Luigi know that they must re-enter Bowser's body to find the Star Cure. Bowser, unaware of this information - continues, smashing a roadblock to get ahead. This reveals a crack in a wall, which is smashed easily by Mario's Hammer. A pipe is found, making a permanent link between Bowser's Pipe Yard and Toad Town. While Bowser travels toward Dimble Wood, Mario and Luigi find Durmite in the Energy Hold. However, the worm escapes under some Boo-faced blocks. The Mario Bros. cannot continue the chase until the blocks can be removed. In the meantime, Bowser explores Bubble Lake. During his exploration, Bowser enjoys taking time to smell flowers - Mario and Luigi must make Bowser have an allergic reaction. This reaction causes a Bowser-sized sneezes, a total of three is all it takes to comepletely destroy a ship. Bowser is eventually crushed by a Tower of Yikk. Mario and Luigi ford the adrenaline channel to save Bowser again. It turns out that this tower holds the answer to the bros' problem. Yikk has invented a Boo-ray, which causes the Boo-blocks to disappear. Mario and Luigi then give a long chase after Durmite - long enough to learn Drill Bros. along the way. Finally, Durmite is seemingly cornered - but Mario and Luigi cannot catch it because it can dig to escape the bros' hats. Mario and Luigi follow Durmite to the deepest part of the Energy Hold. Finally, Durmite has had enough of being followed - and demands a reason. Mario explains that they need the Star Cure, and Durmite agrees on one condition - the bros. must beat it in battle. In battle, Durmite reveals its true form - Wisdurm - which is much more powerful. Mario and Luigi win the long battle, and recieve the first Star Cure. Right about that time, Bowser finally arrives in Dimble Wood. Dr. Toadley sends a message to Mario, Luigi, and Bowser - in which he congratulates the bros. and tells them that the next Star Cure is at Plack Beach. Bowser is furious that the Mario bros. somehow beat him to the Star Cure, but is informed by his minions that the second Cure is actually at his castle. Bowser begins speeding in that direction, and the Mario bros. secretly get a free trip there as well, via Bowser. Bowser successfully gets to his castle, but finds that his basement has been closed off by Fawful. With some help from Mario and Luigi, Bowser pushes a large statue of Fawful off the balcony, opening the way to the basement. Bowser reaches his secret treasure room, and is soon smashed by the Fawful Express. Mario and Luigi revive Bowser by fording the adrenaline channel, and Bowser once again grows to titanic size. Bowser defeats the Fawful Express, shrinks to normal size again, and finds the safe that the Star Cure is locked in. However, he forgot the combination. Mario and Luigi travel to Bowser's Memory Bank and battle Bowser Memory ML. Then the Mario Bros. repair the memory location by doing a puzzle. Bowser remembers the combination, but gets locked in his safe. Chippy asks Bowser if she can have the Star Cure, so Bowser eats it. With the second Star Cure in hand, Mario and Luigi exit Bowser through the Pipe Yard, and return to Toad Town. Mario and Luigi return to Toadley's Clinic, and are told that the third and final Star Cure is at Plack Beach. Dr. Toadley makes sure Mario and Luigi's breathing is good before continuing - and Luigi breaks the machine on accident. Air leaks into the main office of the clinic, and Mario learns to use this air to inflate himself. Using his new ability, Mario saves Birdley who decides to travel with Mario and show him the way to the Star Sage. Mario and Luigi climb all the way to the top of a mountain and find the Star Sage, stuck (literally) in meditation. The Sage agrees to give the bros. the Star Cure if they can knock him out of his position. The bros. are unable to do so, and are sent to Dimble Wood to retrive a new set of Attack Pieces. After collecting the first six, Mario is stolen by Sockops - so Luigi must collect three more pieces by himself. He finds Mario and the last piece about to be eaten by a small group of them. Mario is revived by his brother, and they defeat the Sockhops to learn Snack Basket. Mario and Luigi climb back up the mountain and use their new attack to earn the final Star Cure. Mario and Luigi return to Toadley's Clinic, where the three Star Cures are combined to create the Miracle Cure. The Miracle Cure cures all the blorbed Toads and destroys the walls created by the Dark Star - Mario and Luigi can now enter Peach's Castle.Powers and Abilities  Mario normally has much better Pow and Speed than Luigi.Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga  Mario can also use these techniques in battle, called Bros. attacks. Bros Attacks:Mario and Luigi: Partner's in Time  Mario initiates the Bros. Ball in the field, which allows the bros. to move much faster. They can also run over the babies (Baby Cakes) and allow them to fit into the tightest of spaces, as well as fly on the wind.Mario and Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story Personality  Mario is the hero of the Mushroom Kingdom who has gone on many adventures. He known for his unstoppable courage and super jump. While Mario is not afraid to go on adventures on his own, he does not mind his brother Luigi coming along, as two are better than one. Mario will do anything to save his girlfriend, Princess Peach, from all of her captors. Mario does not hate Bowser, even though he has kidnapped Peach countless times, but rather holds a rivalry with him, and will not hesitate to an alliance when the situation is dire enough. Mario is also known to be very brash and headstrong. He tends to jump into situations rather than thinking about them. A clear example of this is when he develops the Bean Fever from eating food unfamiliar to him. Despie him having some faults, Mario is determined to protect the people he cares about (such as Princess Peach and Luigi).Trivia Midbus  \"Sense is for the weak!\" Midbus in Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story Midbus is one of the prime antagonists of Mario and Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story. He is Fawful's highest ranked minion.History  When Bowser meets Fawful, he sends Midbus to battle him. During the battle, Fawful unintentionally teaches Bowser how to use his action commands on Midbus. Due to the effects of the Vacuum Mushroom, Bowser ended up getting weakened, and Midbus and Fawful abandon him, but not before telling him that they plan to take over his castle. Later in the game, Fawful puts him in charge of Bowser's Castle, his now secondary base, along with Bowser's now brainwashed minions. When Bowser approaches the castle, Midbus makes it animate to attack him. In a scene of delicious irony, he lands the castle on top of Bowser. Bowser then becomes giant thanks to Mario and Luigi. Midbus fights Giant Bowser within his own castle. After being defeated, he retreats with the castle into a new area. He later drops an enormous Iron Ball on Bowser, but Bowser was able to toss it back, preventing the castle from moving any further. When Bowser reaches the castle, he realizes it's been completely changed by Fawful. Bowser finds out that he made a piece of Bowser's Castle into Fawful's own place, Fawful's Theater. Fawful is seen hosting some kind of show or act. When Bowser is about to fight Fawful, he sends Midbus to battle him again in a cage match. In this battle, Midbus attacks in various ways. He can attack by trying to body slam Bowser or tackling into him. He can also punch and do other various attacks. When he attacks Bowser perfectly, food and coins will be thrown to him. Midbus can then eat the food to recover HP, which Bowser can inhale. Bowser can do the same thing by doing a good move on Midbus, though he will only gain coins. After Bowser finally defeats Midbus, he is rewarded with a banquet feast. He gets overstuffed though and gets stuck in the floor. Later in the game, Fawful and Midbus see Bowser stuck. Midbus brings out a treadmill, which Bowser falls onto and uses to make himself normal-sized again. In Princess Peach's Castle, Midbus makes a trash monster attack the Mario Bros. so they can't pass to rescue who is knocked out. After the defeat, he goes into another area of Princess Peach's Castle. Later in Peach's Castle, Bowser meets Midbus again. Fawful powers the pig up, and he becomes Blizzard Midbus. During the battle, Blizzard Midbus can use many ice-related attacks. In one of his attacks, he can jump onto a gigantic snowball and try to roll over Bowser with it. There is a Bob-omb sticking out of it which Bowser must punch to make the snowball explode. After Blizzard Midbus's HP is halved, he sometimes hides the Bob-omb so the player will have to remember where it is. Blizzard Midbus can also send Snawfuls out of his crown to attack Bowser. They can throw little snowballs at Midbus to make him recover HP. Bowser can inhale them, though, and allow Mario and Luigi to battle the small foes. Blizzard Midbus also attacks by using snowballs. If he looks at the snowball, he won't throw it at Bowser, but if he looks at Bowser before throwing it, it will go towards him. Then, Blizzard Midbus will attempt to punch him. It can be countered, as usual. Once again, he attacks by body slamming Bowser. Bowser's Fire Breath can cause a lot of damage to Blizzard Midbus. After Blizzard Midbus is defeated, he gets frozen in a gigantic block of ice, leaving only Fawful to contend with. He then begins pumping out an infinite stream of frosty gas from his snout. Bowser needs to use the gas to help the Mario Brothers progress inside his body. It's unknown what happened to Midbus after the events of the game. If followed logically, he may have unfrozen by then, or arrested when the Toads who were rebuilding Princess Peach's Castle.Attacks  In the very first fight that Bowser and Midbus have, Midbus has only one attack for most of the battle. Midbus will curl himself in a ball and roll toward Bowser, Bowser must counter the attack by punching Midbus back when he is close enough. In the second battle against Midbus, he will have a lot more attacks such as: ground pounding which can be countered by the shell defense. Midbus can also puff him self up with a gigantic breath and get his fist ready to give Bowser a big whack. This can only be defended by punching Midbus a number of times in the stomach. Midbus can even swing a chain at Bowser, Bowser must use the Shell defense when Midbus is close enough, then Midbus will throw the Chain Ball at Bowser. Then Bowser must punch the Chain Ball out of the screen. In the very last battle against Midbus,\u00a0Fawful\u00a0uses a ray gun to transform Midbus into Blizzard Midbus. Blizzard Midbus will create a giant Snowball for him to stand on and crush Bowser. The Snowball has only one weakness which is the Bob-omb inside of it, Bowser must punch the Bob-omb to make it explode under Midbus's feet. Blizzard Midbus can also jump up and throw a barrage of snow balls at Bowser. Bowser must use the shell defense to cover himself from the falling snow balls. If Bowser avoids all of them, Blizzard Midbus will come down and attack Bowser with a Sliding Punch.Bowser must counter the attack with a quick punch of his own. Blizzard Midbus can also unleash snow minions called Snawfuls from his crown.The Snawfuls can boost Midbus's defense or attack Bowser by freezing him.\u00a0Bowser must inhale them on his next turn for Mario and Luigi to fight. Mario and Luigi must defeat five or more Snawfuls in order for him to cough up some of the vapor from the Snawfuls the Bros. defeated. The vapor will harden into an ice cube, preventing Blizzard Midbus from creating any more Snawfuls.Personality  Midbus has a fairly short temper and he likes to act tough. Midbus speaks in broken sentences that make little sense. \"He claims sense is for the weak\" and gives unnecessary long names for weapons he uses such as his Giant Iron Ball (Super Ultra Wonder Ultimate Ruthless Great Iron Ball) or the Junker (Super Ultra Great Mega Trashy Monster Junker Bot)Stats Battle 1  HP = 79 (95) POW = 30 (58) DEF = 34 (60) Speed = 14 (29)Battle 2  HP = 950 (1425) POW = 110 (275) DEF = 76 (114) Speed = 21 (32) (stats in brackets are those when the challenge medal is equipped.)Trivia Luigi  Luigi is Mario's younger brother. In the Mario and Luigi series he is one of the stars, along with his brother. He first appeared in Mario Bros., an arcade game, and has since become one of the stars of the series. Unlike his brother, Mario, Luigi is less known in the series by the characters and is usually called \"Green Guy\", \"Green Stache\", or simply \"Green\"History Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga  In Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga, Mario had to go to the Beanbean Kingdom. Luigi, however, did not plan to go with Mario and wanted to simply wish Mario luck. Of course, Bowser forced Luigi to go on the Koopa Cruiser and do the adventure with Mario in the Beanbean Kingdom. While on the cruiser, Luigi was grabbed by a giant crane and ended up keeping a lookout around the cruiser. Luigi noticed Cackletta and Fawful nearby and went so crazy that his eyes seemed to almost pop out! Afterwords, Fawful destroyed the Koopa Cruiser and the Mario Bros. stumbled on Stardust Fields. Later in the game when the bros are in Little Fungitown, Mario wins an Invincishroom in an arcade game. He eats it but is not used to the food in the area and gets Bean Fever and because of it, Mario can not help Luigi anymore. However, Luigi would do anything for his brother and was told to go to Guffawha Ruins to get Crabbie Grass. However, many rumors indicated that a bone crushing monster lives there. Luigi becomes very nervous on the way to the ruins until he meets Psycho Kamek, who makes Luigi think he is Mario, and Luigi becomes brave enough to go to the ruins! After solving puzzles in the ruins, Luigi meets the monster who turns out not evil but annoyed by everybody making up rumors. After playing a minigame with it, Luigi gets Crabby Grass and heads back to Mario. On the way back, Luigi almost get hit by lightning. He then meets Cackletta, who reveals that she has become Bowletta and has captured Princess Peach. Luigi hurries over to Mario and revives him, then tells him the Peach has been kidnapped. Mario then springs up and runs back to his adventure with Luigi. The bros are told to go to Joke's End by Bowletta to give her the Beanstar. However, the bros would never give her the Beanstar and Prince Peasley pulls out a fake Beanstar to give to them. When Luigi gives Fawful the fake Beanstar, he easily realizes that it is fake and steals the real one. Mario, though, comes up with a plan. He used one of Peach's extra dresses and made Luigi wear it and cover his mustache to look like the Princess. Then they tricked Bowletta and made her think that she had a fake Peach, so Bowletta gave the bros. back the actually real Peach and took the disguised Luigi. Bowletta and Fawful took Luigi to the Repaired Koopa Cruiser where they realized that who they thought was the Princess was actually Luigi wearing a dress. Luigi quickly ran away, stole back the Beanstar, and jumped out of the Koopa Cruiser while using the dress as a parachute. The landing site was in Teehee Valley where Mario, the real Princess Peach, and Toadsworth waited for him. Luigi of course was very clumsy and miss the target and fell into quicksand, which took him to Popple's underground lair. Mario finds Luigi but Popple doesn't let the bros. leave so easily. Popple fights the bros. with his new rookie, Birdo, but Mario and Luigi beat them. In the end, Mario and Luigi fought Bowletta in Bowser's Castle and Luigi is last seen in the airplane to the Mushroom Kingdom with Mario, Peach, and Toadsworth.Mario and Luigi: Partners in Time  For more information, please see Baby Luigi. Mario and Luigi never get separated in this game but there are a few major parts about Luigi: In the beginning of Mario and Luigi: Partners in Time, a time hole appears in the castle gardens and Luigi stands on the end and looks at it. Toadsworth slams into the time hole though and Luigi loses his balance and falls in. Mario jumps into the time hole to catch his brother. Luigi is also seen being trampled by Mario and the babies many times.Mario and Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story  Luigi has a major role in Mario and Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story. After being sucked up by Bowser, Luigi is seen inside a bubble which Mario rescues him from. Luigi is usually afraid of bosses and has to be forced into boss battles. Once again also, he is very clumsy and childish. Luigi once actually suggested he stays behind while Mario and Starlow fight. Luigi, however, despite being afraid, shows his sympathy for his brother, Mario, by rescuing him from some Sockops.Powers and Abilities  Luigi generally has higher HP, BP/SP and Def. than Mario, as well as low Pow. and Speed. Luigi also has higher Stache in PiT and BiS.Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga abilities:  Luigi can also use the moves above to make Mario spit out water when he is filled with it. If Luigi hits Mario with his hammer, Mario will become smaller and be able to reach tight spaces. Luigi can also use his Thunder Hand on Mario to easily move backwards without turning around, usually used to turn Boo Switches. Bros Moves:Personality  On some occasions, Luigi is brave. However, in the Mario and Luigi series, Luigi is the exact opposite, and he would rather not go on adventures with Mario. But after many unexpected happenings in the games, Luigi usually has to help Mario. In Superstar Saga, he is forced by Bowser to go on the Koopa Cruiser; in Partners in Time he accidentally falls into a time hole, and in Bowser's Inside Story, he is inhaled by Bowser. Althogh not near as courageous as his brother, he has proven to be quite the brave fellow and would do anything for Mario, such as get Crabby Grass for him before he was turned into a bean. It is also noticed that Luigi wishes to be like Mario.\u00a0Trivia Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga  Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga (known in Japan as Mario & Luigi RPG) is the first game in the Mario and Luigi series. It was announced on February 13, 2014, that it would be coming to the Wii U Virtual Console April 2014.Story  After Mario's last vacations, an ambassador arrives in the Mushroom Kingdom from the Beanbean Kingdom, a neighboring kingdom. However, it is no friendly visit\u00a0! The ambassador is actually Cackletta, accompanied by her minion Fawful! The evil witch and her toady steal Princess Peach's voice, and take off to the skies. Meanwhile, Luigi is out in front of his and Mario's house, hanging up Mario's overalls. Toad races up to him, and asks him if he saw the kingdom courier. Luigi shakes his head, and Toad dashes into Mario's home. The player then can explore the house with Toad, but there isn't much to be seen, so he heads into the bathroom, where Mario is taking a shower while humming the Super Mario Bros. theme song. Toad yells \"EEEEEEEEK!\" and runs out, embarrassed, and accidentally smashes his head into a cabinet. Mario learns that something happened to Peach so he runs off his house, get dressed rather fast (by accidentally taking Luigi on the way) and then heads to Peach's Castle. There, Mario sees Peach crying while being attacked by Bowser. Luigi accidentally hits Bowser and there start a battle between Mario and the king of Koopas. The mustached plumber easily wins, but a Toad learn him that the ambassador of the Beanbean Kingdom taked Peach's voice and escaped to the Beanbean Kingdom. Mario, Luigi and Bowser go to the Beanbean Kingdom by using Bowser's massive airship, the Koopa Cruiser, and then starts a new adventure...Gameplay Battle  To start a battle Mario or Luigi must touch an enemy. They can also perform the First Strike by jumping on or hitting the enemy with a hammer before battle. Since the game is an RPG the player and the enemy take turns to attackSolo Moves  One of the four options is a solo attack witch is simply an attack the attack options are: Jump:Mario or Luigi will jump on the enemy, this ability is unlocked from the start Hammer:Mario or Luigi will wack the enemy with their hammer, this ability is unlocked after the bros recieve hammers from the Hammer Head Bros Firebrand:This ability is exlusive to Mario.Mario will generate a fireball in his hands witch will burn the enemy Thunderhand:This ability is exlusive to Luigi, who generates a ball of electric in his hands wich will shock the enemy Action Commands:Action Commands have two functions, the first is to make attacks stronger and the other is to dodge enemy attacks, both are used by pressing the bros character buttonsPlayable Characters Non-Playable Characters Dark Fawful  Dark Fawful is a transformation of Fawful in Mario and Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story. He is created when Fawful gets half of the Dark Star's energy.History  Dark Fawful was created when Fawful absorbed half of the Dark Star's energy. He then started looking for the rest of the dark power. Meanwhile, the dark Star is absorbing Bowser's DNA to form Dark Bowser, the final boss of the game. While looking for the Dark Star, Fawful winds up in the meeting room from the beginning of the game. Bowser then finds Dark Fawful and fights him.Attacks  Dark Fawful is\u00a0the second to last\u00a0boss from Mario and Luigi Bowser's Inside Story. One of his attacks involves taking out a gun and shooting stars at Bowser. To avoid, Bowser must punch the largest star. Then Dark Fawful could have four plasma balls around him. Bowser must punch the Goomba\u00a0provided to damage Dark Fawful.\u00a0\u00a0 Dark Fawful can also pull out two holes and\u00a0levitate over Bowser, tossing energy blasts into them. It depends on which hole Dark Fawful puts the plasma balls in to see if Bowser should Punch or use Shell Defense. Fawful can also use his headgear to grab onto the chandelier and swing into Bowser. The player must punch Fawful three times to send him flying, but be careful as Fawful will swing all the way around hitting Bowser as he does. His headgear can also spray a purple gas that can heal him.Trivia \u00a0Stats  HP: 1736 and 2236 with Challenge Medal Power: 334 and 834 with Challenge Medal Defense: 184 and 684 with Challenge Medal Speed: 48 and 548 with Challenge MedalBaby Princess Peach  Baby Princess Peach is the younger self of Princess Peach. She appears in Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time.Dark Bowser  Dark Bowser is the Final Boss of Mario and Luigi Bowser's Inside Story. He was formed by the Dark Star, which had absorbed Bowser's DNA inside his body and copied all Bowser's abilities. However, after escaping Bowser's Body, Dark Bowser had no legs. It was completed when the Dark Fawful Bug went inside Dark Bowser. Dark Bowser is actually far more evil than regular Bowser as while Bowser's desire is to take over the Mushroom Kingdom, Dark Bowser actually wants to destroy it outright. He was destroyed by the combined efforts of Mario, Bowser, and Luigi.Stats Dark Bowser  (stats in brackets are the Challenge Medal ones)Belly  (stats in brackets are the Challenge Medal ones)Trivia Elder Princess Shroob  Elder Princess Shroob is the final boss in Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time. She is main leader of the Shroob forces sent to conquer the Mushroom Kingdom, along with Princess Shroob.History Mario and Luigi: Partners in Time  When Princess Peach arrived in the past with Toadiko and Toadbert, both Shroob princesses immediately attacked her. Princess Peach trapped the elder princess in the Cobalt Star, and shattered it.Battle  Elder Princess Shroob is much stronger than her sister, and commands a fleet of Shroob UFOs. Her attacks depend on how many saucers are present; with just one, she can heal herself with a drink that recovers 120 of her HP, (80 in the Japanese and European versions) or summon a Shroobified enemy called a Shroob Chomp to attack Mario or Luigi. The UFO guides the Chomp towards a Bro. and the player has to quickly see which way the UFO is going. If two saucers are present she can ride on top of the UFO's and fire large energy blasts at the Bros. from the front; these come down much too fast for both Mario Bros. to jump over a blast at once, so they must pay attention to which hand the princess uses to fire the energy blast. The Princess then fires at the Bros. from the background, forcing both Bros. to jump if the Princess isn't lined up with the top of her throne before being blown from the UFOs and landing on the platform, causing a shock-wave that again forces the Bros. to jump at the same time. With three UFOs she can summon a Shroob Meteor, with which she attempts to crush the Bros. Every time more Shroob UFOs are summoned, Princess Peach throws a star to the Bros., with which they can knock saucers out of the sky and prevent Elder Princess Shroob from using some of her attacks. The Princess's only move that is always available is a headlong football tackle towards one of the brothers. The younger versions of the plumbers then have to hammer her away twice before she finally relents, further, only the last strike counterattacks. Occasionally she uses a tactic of stopping right before the targeted brother, tricking him into swinging his hammer too early and then quickly charging again; she reveals that she is going to stop by waving her hand wildly and gaining a crooked expression. In the Japanese and European version of the game, every time after the player attacks Elder Princess Shroob, a\u00a0! appears above her and she uses this attack against the Bro. who attacked her previously, no matter whose turn it is. Once Elder Princess Shroob loses 3500 HP, she activates her crown and morphs into a beast, which is her true form, and causes Princess Peach to faint. The Bros. must deplete 3,000 more HP from the Elder Princess Shroob to put an end to the Shroob invasion, but doing so is not nearly direct as it was in the first battle. In this second form, Elder Princess Shroob has seven parts: four arm tentacles, a group of leg tentacles, a crown, and her main body. She also has a particle effect surrounding her, flowing upward, though only in her full form. The leg tentacles and crown come back in about three turns after their health is depleted and each arm tentacle comes back in one turn. In order to defeat the Princess, the Bros. must destroy her leg tentacles and then deactivate her crown, which otherwise causes all attacks directed against the Princess's body to deal only 1 damage. Each body part has different attacks usually going in the order of feet/head, tentacles, and then the feet's tentacle sweep attack. This move that can be dodged by jumping is eerily similar to Cackletta's arm swing attack in her ghost form. Once she has taken a certain amount of damage, she uses three tentacles instead of two. The feet have three attacks in total and each one is synced with the head; one move is where the Shroob royalty backs up with her feet and then spits out poisonous clouds of gas like the one Swiggler uses but is dodged by jumping. Another is the one mentioned earlier, the tentacle sweep. The last is the rarest attack of them all; she backs up, summons a Time Hole and six saucers, and spits a giant laser ball that hits the saucers, causing them to either burn or short-circuit and then fall into the time hole, after which she resumes her attacks. The next turn, if the legs aren't destroyed by then, the Time Hole is opened again and the saucers attack either Mario or Luigi. The burned ones attack Mario and the shocked ones attack Luigi, a reference to Mario's Firebrand and Luigi's Thunderhand abilities from Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga. They come in the order that the giant laser ball hits them, the first one the giant laser-ball hits is first, and the last the giant laser ball hits is the last; all of these UFO's must be flung back at the Elder Princess Shroob with a hammer. Her head only has one attack; and that is summoning up a giant laser ball and hitting saucers with it identical to the Time Hole attack except without the Time Hole. Her tentacles have three attacks. One is to grab the Bros. and throw them. The babies must hit the tentacles together repeatedly as they slither forward to prevent her from grabbing them. This attack can not hurt Princess Shroob in any way when countered, but needs both bottom tentacles to activate. Another attack is to shoot a huge laser ball into the air then throw red and green energy balls into it. The ball falls towards the Bro. whose colors match the highest number of colored blasts that were absorbed by the orb. It can be countered solely with hammers. After the giant energy ball is countered by the targeted brother, it falls towards the other one and must be knocked away again. This strike sends it straight into Princess Shroob's face, damaging her. This attack needs both top tentacles to activate. Finally, her last attack is to stab a brother with the tips of her tentacles. The tentacle shines first before attacking. Each tentacle is assigned to a brother, right for Mario, left for Luigi. Her top right tentacle hits above Mario and is only used when there is no top left tentacle. The top left tentacle hits above Luigi and is only used when there is no top right. This attack is only used if both bottom tentacles are present.Mario and Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story  Bizarrely, Elder Princess Shroob appears in the background during the (optional) battle against the Shroobs in Mario and Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story. This is very strange, as in Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time, Princess Shroob was defeated, turned into a mushroom, eaten by Bowser, and then destroyed again.Personality  Elder Princess Shroob is shown to be somewhat more evil than Princess Shroob, and after Princess Shroob is defeated, she mourns over the loss of her sister. She is shown cruel and ruthless, caring only\u00a0for herself, power,\u00a0and her sister\u00a0Unlike most Shroobs, including Princess Shroob, Elder Princess Shroob speaks English, in addition to the generic Shroob language however when she speaks in English, her text is in all capitals. She also ruthlessly shoots down her flying saucers and even knocks away her minions even for doing a simple task like bringing her a drink. It's unknown if the Elder Princess Shroob is normally like this to her people or if it was because she was angry about her sister's death.Stats Phase 1  HP - 3500 (1800) POW - 130 (210) DEF - 130 (150) Speed - 62 (100) EXP - 0 Coins - 0Phase 2 Elder Princess Shroob  HP - 3000 (2000) POW - 140 (230) DEF - 140 Speed - 64 (70) EXP - 0 Coins - 0Foot  HP - 400 (500) POW - 140 (190) DEF - 140 Speed - 64 (50) EXP - 0 Coins - 0Tentacle  HP - 200 (350) POW - 140 (200) DEF - 140 (126) Speed - 64 (70) EXP - 0 Coins - 0Crown  HP - 200 POW - 140 (0) DEF - 140 Speed - 64 (50) EXP - 0 Coins - 0Popple  I'll be taking that, see? Popple, Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga. Popple is a villain in Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga. He is a wannabe thief who has had many rookies. His first Rookie was amnesiac Bowser, his second was Birdo. Popple also calls himself the \"Shadow Thief.History Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga  Popple was first encountered in Chucklehuck Woods trying to steal the secret of the brewery's world famous drink, Chuckola Cola, with his partner Rookie (who was really Bowser who apparently lost his memory from being shot out of a cannon in Stardust Fields and didn't recognize the Mario Bros). Popple and Bowser fight Mario and Luigi. After being defeated, the Mario Bros. continued their adventure. Popple and Rookie were seen again before Mario and Luigi fought the Chuckulator. However, they were shot away by it. Popple is seen again in Wohoo Hooniversity trying to steal the Beanstar. When Mario and Luigi battle him, Popple and Rookie have a Bros. Attack. Their attack is for Rookie to flame Popple and throw him in the air, while Rookie creates shockwaves on the ground, then hurls Popple at the bros. After being defeated, a Peach Bot suddenly falls in the room and makes the Bean Star go crazy and Popple, Rookie, and the Mario Bros. grab on to the star, but they all fall off and Popple gets separated with Rookie. The Bean Star then shatters into four pieces. Popped landed likely in Chucklehuck Woods. When Mario and Luigi revisit Chucklehuck Woods to get a piece of the Bean Star, Popple is trying to steal the Beanstar piece. This is the first and only time he is battled alone. In this battle he has much higher defense. He also has the ability to steal Mario or Luigi's Hammers. After being defeated, Popple runs away underground, swearing revenge. Popple is found again in Teehee Valley, underground. This time, Popple has a new Rookie, Birdo, who \"loves\" Popple, and Popple gets very freaked out about it. Mario and Luigi fight the thief again and after being beat, Popple is sentenced to community service in Little Fungitown, and, ironically, his partner calls him Rookie. Mario and Luigi: Dream Team Popple wasn't seen again until Mario and Luigi: Dream Team. He will be heard robbing a building in Wakeport, when he sees nothing he wants. Luigi tries to walk into the building, when he and Popple crash into each other. Popple would get mad at the bros, then becomes calm and goes away. Popple is now found still in Wakeport at Wiggler's garden, insulting Wiggler. The Mario Bros. go into the garden. (But, you might want to save a Pi'illo before you meet up with them.) When you meet up with them, Popple would say that with the help of Mario and Luigi, Wiggler would be gone. Wiggler gets mad because Popple called him a moth. Popple will go first by pulling Wiggler's flower on his head. He'd get mad and make waves at the bros. Wiggler flings Popple off of him. Hammer him onto Wiggler.Trivia Bowletta  My new country has no need for old superstars! It will do just fine with one: The Great Bowletta! -Bowletta, Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga Bowletta is the fusion between Bowser's body and Cackletta's Soul.Role in Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga  After Cackletta is defeated by the Mario Bros, Fawful sucks up her spirit to save her from death. Later on Stardust Fields, Fawful finds Bowser and possesses it with Cackletta's spirit, and Cackletta becomes Bowletta. During the final battle, Bowletta will use the powers of Bowser. She can shoot fire balls at the bros. and also use them to regain HP. One of her attacks will put two blocks above Mario and Luigi and Bowletta will charge\u00a0some fire energy and then spit out a massive flame that will hurt the bros if the blocks are in the way. The blocks can disappear by hitting them 5 times each bro. Bowletta can then turn dark, and cause red, green, and purple stars to fall on the bros. The red stars\u00a0fall\u00a0on Mario, the green stars\u00a0fall on\u00a0Luigi, and the purple stars crash against the ground and do no damage to either of the bros.\u00a0 These stars can be countered\u00a0with\u00a0Mario and Luigi's Hammers. In her Dark form, the bros. will recieve damage from jumping on her. After giving her a certain amount of damage, she will act as if she has been beat. However, while the bros. celebrate their victory, a\u00a0Time Bob-Omb\u00a0comes from behind and blows them up. Mario and Luigi faint, and\u00a0Bowletta eats them to destroy the bros. once and for all. However, Mario and Luigi manage to wake up inside her with only one HP each. There they fight Cackletta's spirit in the\u00a0true final battle. After defeating her spirit, Cackletta can no longer live, and\u00a0Bowser reverts to his normal self.Base Stats:  HP:500\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Defense:180 Speed:150 (80 in Dark Form)Trivia  Bowletta has the least first form HP of all Mario and Luigi final bosses with 500, Princess Shroob with 1567, Dark Bowser with 1000 and Dreamy Bowser with 2000Ratfink43 Major Add-ons  Well, I added some new Articles, Check them out! --G00mba 03:59, December 31, 2009 (UTC)I Apologise...

Please edit this page to tell the community about yourself!My favorite pages Princess Shroob  Princess Shroob is the second in command of the Shroob army. Along with Elder Princess Shroob, she attacked the Mushroom Kingdom and took over it.History Mario and Luigi: Partners in Time  Princess Peach trapped The Elder Princess Shroob in the Cobalt Star. As a result, Princess Shroob attacked princess Peach. Princess Shroob then began to take over the past Mushroom Kingdom. Mario and Luigi from the present teamed up with their baby selves to stop Princess Shroob. Princess Shroob sent all three Shrooboids to the Mario Bros. They are Junior Shrooboid, Shrooboid Brat, and Elder Shrooboid. Princess Shroob fought the Mario Bros, and lost. Somehow, during the events of Mario and Luigi Bowser's Inside Story, Mario and Luigi find a shroob boss in a cold-storage room outside of Bowser in Bowser's Castle. On the ceiling, you can see millions of shroobs stuck to the walls. In the center of the clump is the Elder Princess Shroob, who appears to be thawing and beside her on the corner is Princess Shroob. Although it is not known, many Mario enthusiasts believed this to be a hint of a 4th Mario & Luigi RPG in the making. The password to the Shroob preservation chamber is displayed below basically you need to whack the button shape the number of times shown below with your hammer.Personality  Princess Shroob is very selfish, caring over power than her own sister (who cares for her). This makes sense because she made no effort to fix the Cobalt Star and is tired of being second in command and second best to her sister. She also sees joy in the pain of others, as shown when the Koopa Cruiser was shot down, Peach being eaten by Petey Piranha, Mario and the gang falling into Gritzy Cave and off the Mother Ship with Kaylie Koopa.\u00a0But she does seem to care and show concern for her subjects than her sister does. But after the Mother Ship was shot down by the Mario Bros. and the babies, she went insane, derange, and mentally unstable, likely fed up with their meddling in her plans in conquest on the Mushroom Kingdom. This lead to her downfall and death however strangely despite her death, she is still seen frozen in the preservation chamber in Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story.Stats Trivia The Shadow Emprorer  Hey Shadow34!

Instead of having every single part in the game like on mariowiki, I think we should just put in a short summary of the story until more users come and fix that up. I'll try to get more people to join this wikia later(: --Fawfulfury65 23:29, October 6, 2009 (UTC)Fawfulfury65 Hey did you design any templates yet? --Fawfulfury65 21:42, October 12, 2009 (UTC)Fawfulfury65 OK sweet! So I'm guessing that means we will have more users and articles. Right? --Fawfulfury65 00:39, October 16, 2009 (UTC)Fawfulfury65Weird  That's strange because we are the only admins and I didn't delete it. Right now I'm stumped on who did that. --Fawfulfury65 12:31, October 25, 2009 (UTC)Fawfulfury65 Wait didn't you give Hunter Neb bureaucrat rights before(I saw it on his talkpage). It's unlikely that he did it, but its worth checking! It would be best if we started over on the Q & A page, though... --Fawfulfury65 12:42, October 25, 2009 (UTC)Fawfulfury65Hey  Shadow 34 I made edits to the Dark Fawful article but I dont know if I did the best job on it. Can you check it for me? THANKS!!!! Ratfink43 Hello Im YoshiFawful112 Im a big fan of Yoshi and Fawful!!!!!Whats going on with you??? YoshiFawful12 Thank Im new and I love it!!!!!!!And you are right......Mario and Luigi Bowsers Inside story is the best game EVER!!!!!!! YoshiFawful112 Ok Thanks for the Heads up I will try that!!!!I havent beat the game yet I am just about to enter Peaches Castle!!!!!!And I got it the first day it came out!!!!!!!!! YoshiFawful112DSi LL  I know! I heard about that!!! But the problem is that I just got a DSi and if that's coming soon than I'm going to be dieing because I have no money for that kind of stuff. Although you know the DSi LL is actually like twice the size as a normal DSi so that's just annoying! But I'll probably get one at some point. Oh and wouldn't it be necessary to make an article on the DS systems and Gameboy Advance since the M&L series is made for them?--Fawfulfury65 00:22, October 30, 2009 (UTC)Fawfulfury65 I made the article on the DS! And have you noticed that the rules page was deleted too?! I don't get why these pages are getting deleted!!! I'll recreate it sometime but don't you think that we should have to \"no yous\" thing in the rules. Mariowiki has this rule where you have to say \"the player\" or \"Mario\"(or any character name), but not \"you\" I find that a very good rule actually and it's better than reading you, you ,you over and over again. And what can I do with um... what do you call it rights that start with a B... Sorry I have a bad memory on that kind of stuff.--Fawfulfury65 02:20, October 31, 2009 (UTC)Fawfulfury65Make the wikia better...  OK! Really, WE NEED MORE USERS!!! We don't even have a rules page, or templates, and we've had the same featured article and featured image since this wiki started! So I've though of was to help this problem... sorta. Users Of course the main problem, we have no members here. So I'd say that both of us should go on MarioWiki and tell people about this wiki. I even put up a whole section on my userpage(on mariowiki) about this wiki and I wrote \"Please go to Marioluigi.wikia.com\" on my pages status bar there, and no human being could miss that since it right there on the top of my page. Also, I think there's a page on mariowiki where we can put a link to this wiki on, so people can click on it and edit here. Some new users here can also make new templates. Featured stuff For the FA and FI... I'd say we should just make some random pictures featured and put them on the main page, and the completed articles should also become featured and on the main page. Really, that could make people enjoy this wiki better because there;s finally something new. And I'd also like to say that I think you should stop making articles and putting in blank sections because well... I don't know, it annoys me and I don't know. I'll think of more reasons when I have time. Rules and Q&A page Yeah those randomly deleted pages. They need to be made. I'm focusing on the rules page though... so I'd say the rules should be: I'll think up more later. --Fawfulfury65 20:57, November 18, 2009 (UTC)Fawfulfury65Question  Hey, I was wondering - to put more info on some of these articles, is it OK to reveal more storyline (as in spoilers), or do you want to keep it general? -Cmario17 OK, I've done A LOT of work on the Bowser article - I'm almost done with the Mario and Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story section. I'll probably work on Mario and Luigi's articles next. -Cmario17I love to help!  Really? Thanks!! Yeah I love helping this wiki and I will continue to do so! Ratfink43 Oh and just another thing...When will we be merging with the PiT wiki. I mean it always says \"We will soon be merging\" Im fine with that I just want to know when. Just curious!!Ratfink43New Templates!!!  I made two new templates(Template: Construction and Template: Image). I guess I'm actually pretty good at those kinds of templates. If you can think of any new templates, give me the idea and I can make it! --Fawfulfury65 23:23, December 3, 2009 (UTC)Fawfulfury65 Really? I've never liked the empty sections in articles. But I guess with a stub template, I can keep an eye on those empty articles and edit them later. Are you good with categories? All the categories I make turn out to be redlinks. 0_o --Fawfulfury65 00:57, December 4, 2009 (UTC)Fawfulfury65 Oh, can you fix those? --Fawfulfury65 01:03, December 4, 2009 (UTC)Fawfulfury65 I thought you could do that... but how? I tried the MarioWiki codes, but it didn't work. My userpage here is boring now, I need some userboxes!--Fawfulfury65 20:40, December 4, 2009 (UTC)Fawfulfury65Pretty much  Yeah that awnsers pretty much all questions. Ratfink43fawful  On a top 10 list, he'd be a 4. Or 5. Chortles Master1029That fool...  That vandal yesterday was a complete fool... Princess Chicken? How creative. But anyway, I have this feeling that I know who the vandal is... someone on the MarioWiki. Really... there's this user and they seem to hate me... But for a while we were getting along so I asked them if they could help this wiki. They never replied to me, though... and I have a feeling it was them... Yeah... --Fawfulfury65 01:37, December 16, 2009 (UTC)Fawfulfury65 Well... I don't know. I'll see if I can get some more people to join. Is there any other way to advertise this wiki? --Fawfulfury65 00:50, February 2, 2010 (UTC)HI  hi im Popple 9000 im also on MarioWiki as Rapahelraven497 (i cant write about Rapahel raven here cause he s only in yoshis Island):) well anyway ill be on here alot and i will help! Popple9000Here  Yeah, I'll check here every once and a while. I actually keep forgetting about this place. We have to find a way to make this wiki more interesting. I mean, something else we can do without having to constantly edit articles. Also, I think we should get rid of the featured image and featured article. There's just not enough people here to vote for featured things. We should replace it with Did You Know things or something. How does that sound? --Fawfulfury65 19:24, April 5, 2010 (UTC)Still here  Im here and all, problem is that I cant find any work to do...I cant think of any articles I start and most of the articles here arent complete but I havent really been able to come up with anything... Maybe I will try to edit some pages. I will get to it!Ratfink43hi  hi ,oh and i have a question! about the wii how can i connect into the internet? u probally never heard of me but im new here almost a month ive been on here and i have no idea what to do i dont even know how to edit stuff......67.142.130.49 20:52, May 24, 2010 (UTC)Ad free  Hi!

He originally found me on the MarioWiki, but I guess he followed the link from my userpage here. I don't care, though, he's just a typical cyber-bully.

Unless this wiki becomes independent, its probably going to stay the same. --Fawfulfury65 15:28, July 7, 2010 (UTC)Sounds good  I think that makes sense Ratfink43Ohai  Lol yes actually.

Dug up long ago, its primary purpose seems to be conquering the world.History  The Dark Star was dug up and was too evil for the Toads in Mushroom Kingdom. The Star Sprites sealed it away deep under Toad Town to stop it's evil ways. It rested there until Fawful found it. Fawful planned to use its power to conquer Mushroom Kingdom. He used its power to barricade Princess Peach's Castle while he used the princess's power to break the seal on it. Just as the Dark Star's seal was about to be broken, Bowser appeared and fought Blizzard Midbus. Then Fawful used his headgear to drain the Dark Star's power, but only got half due to Bowser's interference and disappeared. The Dark Star then came to life and entered Bowser's body and began to absorb his DNA, apparently interested in Bowser's strength and other abilities. Though Mario, Luigi, and Starlow tried to capture it, it simply escaped by using one of Bowser's abilities. After three unsuccessful capture attempts Mario and Luigi engaged the evil star in battle. Though victorious, it\u00a0obtained the DNA it needed and later on transforms into Dark Bowser.Abilities  The Dark Star has many powers to aid it in battle. It can clone itself and create dark satellites, spider-like creatures to assist it in battle and heal it. It can release a bright flash of light that causes the Mario Bros. shadows to come to life it then fires bolts of electricity at the shadow Bros. which in turn harms the real Bros. It can fire lasers at the Bros. It can also fling red and green energy blasts at them. Its strongest attack is firing a large laser at the Bros. When defeated, it will perform a desperation move where it sucks the Bros. in close and self destructs.Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time  Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time (known in Japan as Mario and Luigi RPG 2X2) is the second game in the Mario & Luigi series and the sequel to Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga. Unlike Superstar Saga, this game had Baby Mario and Baby Luigi as playable characters, along with Mario and Luigi.Story  During the events of Partners in Time, Professor Elvin Gadd invents a time machine which Princess Peach travels through to see the Mushroom Kingdom's time. However, an alien race known as the Shroobs invade the kingdom's past and kidnap her. Later in the present time, Time Holes begin to pop up everywhere. Throughout the game, Mario and Luigi\u00a0along with their baby selves\u00a0travel through the holes to collect the Cobalt Star Shards.Trivia Toad  Toad is the name of both a specific character and a species in the Mario & Luigi series. The Toads are the dominant population of the Mushroom Kingdom and can usually be found residing in areas such as Toad Town. Toads appear as small humanoid like characters with mushroom characteristics as well. They come in a variety of different colors as well as seen mainly by the color of their caps. Toad himself is the loyal attendant of Princess Peach and often plays a key role as a supporting character who assists the Mario bros. in the games.History Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga  Toad is playable in the beginning of Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga. He goes into Mario's house looking for him, only to find Mario in the shower. After running out of the shower in total embarrassment, Toad attempts to run out of Mario's house, only to run into wardrobe and then fall unconscious. Mario soon discovers the unconscious Toad and attempts to help Toad gain his consciousness back by jumping on top of his head. After Toad struggles to reveal about the details of what happened to Princess Peach, Mario heads off to Peach's castle (along with Luigi), thus starting their adventure. Toad can later be seen bidding Mario (and Luigi later on) farewell along with Toadsworth as Mario goes on Bowser's Koopa Cruiser. Other Toads act as minor background characters within Princess Peach's Castle, and they often give Mario a few items if he speaks with them.Mario and Luigi: Partners in Time  In Mario and Luigi: Partners in Time, the Shroobs attacked the many worlds of the Mushroom Kingdom and at the same time, they abducted many Toads in order to get their Vim (the life force of the Toads). The vim was used as an energy supply for the Shroobs. In the present day Mushroom King, Toads ran the shops within Peach's Castle. Toad himself was the accomplice of Professor E. Gadd, as he can be seen along side him for most of the game as the professor studied the cobalt stars. Toad's job on the other hand was to guard the unconscious Jr. Shroob that Luigi had refused to look after in the beginning of the game, so that it would not escape from its glass container. He also appeared in the scene prior to the final battle between the Mario Bros. and the transformation of Bowser. He is seen rushing Peach (both present and past), Toadsworth (both present and past) out of the room before Bowser becomes stronger from his consumption of the shroob mushroom and transformation.Mario and Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story  In the beginning of the Mario and Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story, many of the Toads were affected by a disease called the Blorbs which caused them to inflate to many times their original size. This sickness also caused them to roll around uncomfortably and they were soon placed in the Toad Hospital. Mario and Luigi later find a cure to help restore the Toads back to their original forms. Several Toads are also seen inside Bowser's body where they have been swallowed along with Mario and Luigi. A secret location, Toad Square is the area where most of the Toads reside in Bowser's body and this area mainly serves to help Mario and Luigi on their quest. Shops are also ran in this area and Toadbert himself runs a help booth in this area.Personality  Toad as a character can be seen as extremely loyal. This is seen mainly in Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga, where he runs off to the Mario Bros. to tell them of what had happened to the princess (unlike many other Toads who fled from the castle to save themselves due to their fears). Also seen in the same game is his impatient nature which is shown twice with the first being when Toad had immediately ran past Luigi when the plumber told him that Mario was inside their house. The second time was seen when Toad runs right into the shower room in Mario and Luigi's house when he heard Mario's humming, unaware that Mario was actually taking a shower. However these traits could be applied to his loyalty to Peach as he had attempted to find Mario as soon as possible in order to help Princess. Like many other characters, Toad seems to have less respect for Luigi than Mario as seen in Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time where he asks the plumber to stay behind while Mario goes on the adventure (though he did accept the fact that Luigi was capable when he saw Luigi's higher jumps). Toad is also shown to be rather protective as he played a body guard like role for Professor E. Gadd as well as for the entire of Princess Peach's Castle by guarding the unconscious Junior Shrooboid throughout the entire plot of Partners in Time. The Toad species in general are shown to be rather cowardly though they are shown to be extremely kind as seen by their help to Mario and Luigi in the games. They are generally happy to give any type of help and advise to the Bros. whenever they are spoken to. However, they appear to be frightened by the sight of Bowser.Trivia The Shadow Emprorer  Hey...something went wrong when I tried to change usernames, so my new page is at The Shadow Emperor.", "Super Mario Flash Wiki": "Super Mario Flash Wiki Main Page  Welcome to Super Mario Flash Wiki Super Mario Flash wiki is a cool wiki about the best flash game around- Super Mario Flash!\u00a0Super Mario Flash Basis  So what is Super Mario Flash (often dubbed \"SMF\")?

Yoshi is a Nintendo character, and is usually Mario's companion in retro and new games. Yoshi is considered cute by many people. He makes few appearances in MarioMario54321's videos, but did appear to almost drown thanks to Fawful in the fake part 2 in Into the Fourth Dimension . Yoshi also appeared on the Star World Castle and may have made cameo appearences in videos, like when someone falls onto the top flagpole on Princess Peach's Castle. His 4D counterpart is Doshi. By 2013, numberous Yoshis, including Yoshi himself, joined YTR.Colors  Yoshis come in many colors, here are they, Green, Yellow, Black, Red, Blue, Pink, Light Blue, Purple, White,Orange and Uni-colorMarioMario54321  MarioMario54321 is the creator of all of his videos and master of this wiki.

Current Projects: Into the Fourth Dimension sequel and The Cosmic Crystals\u00a0Biography  Main articles: Mario64 and Super Mario 64 Bloopers . MarioMario54321 was first known as Mario64 on Lemmy's Land when he was a child. After getting blocked from it after stealing artwork, he left in dispair, many beliving he died. However, he later was \"reborn\" when he joined YouTube, becoming MarioMario54321.\u00a0 He later met Mario himself and began his life in the Mushroom Kingdom, creating videos and attracting other YouTubers to the Mushroom Kingdom. Eventually, they where invited to the Star World to save it from the entity Mastar, went to Ztarragus's Island with Bomberman to collect Ztars and defeat the Ztar entity who owned the island, returned to the Star World and defeated Mastar again, and later to defeat the now full of anger creator of Star World society and the land, and had many more adventures, two more to the Star World. However, him and his friends had their major enemies, the Dopplegangers. After a long battle, including the takeover of the world, and both them and their enemies unable to die, they defeated the Dopples and MM stabilized the Dark Star X, the source of the Dopple's power and life, and merged him with his counterpart, the Light Star X, into Star X. Later, he helped save the Fourth Dimension from Dimentio and went to fight Novuscurous to save the Star World for a fith time.

This is the category for things, people and places from MM's videosOiram  Oiram is Mario's doppleganger and his brother is Igiul. Likes: Igiul, OiramOiram12345, and the other dopples. Hates: Mario, Luigi,MarioMario54321 and his friends & fans. He first appeared in Mario Vs. Oiram, where Mario freed him after imprisoning him and then later, he jumped in the pool of metal and Oiram escaped.\u00a0He saw Mario in the Castle and challenged him to a brawl at The Tower in the Sky and Mario won. In Oiram's Revenge, Oiram returns and loses and tries to stop Mario at even the hardest ways, and took over, until MarioMario54321 time travelled and warned Mario, who wins. Later, his brother appears and possesses both Oiram and his own body yet Mario wins and both are defeated. OiramOiram12345 attacks the castle and takes it over to avenge the Oirams with the Oiraw and his friends. OO eventuly is defeated and then Oiram returns a 4th time and final time and after a wilder aventure Mario wins, then The Dark Star X revives Igiul, but Mario and his friends find out about The Dark Star X and defeats the Oiram Bro, who impersonated LuigiGame2. The dopples come back to defeat the heroes, yet The Dark Star X is stabilized and Oiram fades along with the other dopples. He now lives in Dimension X with his brother Igiul.Trivia LuigiGame2  LuigiGame2 is one of MM54321's best friends and has appeared in The Cosmic Crystals 4, OO12345 and the Dark Star X, Into the Fourth Dimension and MM54321's other videos. His now closed Youtube account was named LGame2. His physical appearance is not to be confused with Igiul, Luigi's doppleganger. Their clothes are exactly alike, however, the difference is that LuigiGame2 has Gray Gloves and Black Shoes while Igiul has White Gloves and Brown Shoes. For this reason, in \"IGIUL 2!!!!!!!\", LuigiGame was framed for Igiul's actions.

Dislikes: Dopplegangers, The DSX, Bowser, Dimentio, and Fawful. He's one of the most common characters! He unfortunatly stopped making Youtube videos on April 26, 2012. However he uploaded a video after the date mentioned above, which is the last part of The Return of Igiul, then he REALLY stopped in May 8, 2012. For personal reasons, as he said on a tweet on twitter, closed his channel in 2018, six years after the last video in 2012.OiramOiram12345  OiramOiram12345 is MarioMario54321's Doppleganger. He first made a cameo appearance in The Fury of CandyCao7. He then appeared in OO12345 and the Shadowreavers as the main antagonist. He appeared in other videos of MM54321. His final appearance was OO12345 and the DSX, as the true main antagonist where he called himself the master of the dopplegangers and the master of the Dark Star X. He merged with it and the Dark Star, first to become Dark Bowser X\u00a0along with Bowser X, then OiramOiram12345 X, but was defeated and was sealed in the Reverse Dimension. He is one of the most powerful antagonists ever known to appear in a\u00a0MarioMario54321 series, from causing massive chaos through dimensions to attempting to convert Mario's world into the Dark Star X's. He was thought to be the original creator of the doppleganger project, but it was soon revealed to be Dark Star X's creation.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He managed to escape the Reverse Dimension with the Dark Star X. However, the DSX was classfied\u00a0as a reverse counterpart, so the Light Star X was created. OO12345 decided to travel back in time to 12 billion years ago and fuse the two to create\u00a0Star X\u00a0in the trajectory of a comet.Trivia OiramOiram12345's other forms Youtubers  This is a group of people who have a youtube account.

She first appeared in \"Mario's Cookie Adventure\", where she aided him in defeating the evil Cookie King. She had an major role in the Doppleganger War and stopping Dimentio from destroying all life, but later disappeared. A year afterwards, MM walked past a missing poster showing her missing and that she last appeared in \"Into the Fourth Dimension\".Physical Description  Lily appears as an orange (humanoid) hedgehog wearing blue clothes. She has two very long quilts, and a fringe partially hiding her right eye (similar to Princess Rosalina from Super Mario Galaxy). Despite being a hedgehog, she looks rather like a cat because of her hears that look like cat hears, causing her to be sometimes mistaken for a cat by some people in real life, and she also may has no spines. Despite eating a lot of cookies (see below), Lily strangely never becomes fat. MM54321 used several looks of her, changing every year in his videos (see below). In \"Roleplay with Lily in Super Mario 64\", she stole Luigi's clothes to delude Mario and make him think she was in fact the green plumber, but she was only wearing Luigi's shirt and overalls, and a black mustache. Mario recognized Lily because of her orange hair that wasn't hidden.Personality  Lily' s personality is delicate and kind, however in MM's videos, she can appear to be less bright than other characters, or at least has no idea what was going on. She enjoys cookies as one of her favorite foods, and MM portrays her to be obsessive over them, and will go far enough to eat cookies even if they are sentient, and could eat the Cookie King twice, him seeming to be able to survive digestion. Lily also appears to be friendly, but will even go to attacking someone when angered, as she kicked CandyCao7 once for being mean to her, and blasted OiramOiram12345 for insulting her. Despite her kind nature, she also mercilessly ate living cookies alive even after aiding her and Mario, proving her odd obsession over them that may blind her sense of right and wrong, and also beat up Bowser for amusement after he was already defeated by Mario.Moon Powers  Lily has moon powers in OiramOiram12345 and the Dark Star X, like Moon Blast, which she used to attack OiramOiram12345 after he called her \"Orange Head\", and OO blasted her after that, then, before he could kill MarioMario54321, was blasted by MM and defeated. Her 4D Counterpart, Rosey (see below), has nature powers.Counterparts  Lily has three known counterparts in MM54321's videos.Trivia Gallery  Note: All of the below pictures were drawn by Lilyncookies herself.CandyCao7  CandyCao7 is a Youtuber and is an anti-hero in MarioMario54321's Bloopers Likes: His siblings (sometimes Mario and His Friends). Hates: Mario, Luigi, MM54321, LuigiLuigi09876, LilynCookies , and\u00a0The Doppleg\u00e4ngers. His doppleganger is OacYdnac7 who CC7 said he created him but was proven false by The Dark Star X. His brother is BandyKao7 and his sister is Dannii4Nina. He hopes to destroy Mario after he thought that CC7 was made out of candy and tried to eat him. CC7 then continued appearing in MM54321's videos as either a hero or a villain. In the early parts of OiramOiram12345 and the Dark Star X,\u00a0 he becomes an anti-hero and was stalked by Lily, who claimed she didn't have anyone else to be with. Oacydnac7 was evil until CandyCao7 turned evil which caused His dopple to be good as a flaw in the Dark Star X where only dopples are evil if their Counterpart is good but in this case his counterpart was evil. LightBallCao & ShadowBallCao were meant to influence CC7 to good or bad, until they merged and disappeared, leaving CC7 to make up his own mind, apparently. He was the third chosen one to wield the Dark Star X, but failed to obtain it by OiramOiram12345. He then started an army of villains to kill the heroes once and for all. He killed his siblings and then fought Mario. He failed, though, and unfortunately for him he was killed.  Outside of the SM64 Community, he was spotted by several people online, namely as a noob or other villain, if you bother him or in other shows unrelated to ours. A villain named CandyCao6 has preserved his legacy and mimics him.\u00a0External links Cave of Sadness  The Cave of Sadness is a cave in the Star World, \u00a0it is filled with sadness. There are sad faces everywhere, seeming to be covering every corner of the cave. The only artifacts that bring happiness in the cave are the Cosmic Crystals, which are found at the very end of the cave, in a secret room. However, in The Moon World episode 3, it was revealed that the joy in the Cosmic Crystals was fake and was inserted by Optimismo to strengthen himself. The cave also has a dinosaur named Teary. It later turned into the Cave of Happiness in The Cosmic Crystals 3.Cosmicalitaurus  \u00a0Cosmicalitaurus is the creator of the Star World and the main antagonist of The Cosmic Crystals III: The End of the Star World. He was the ancient treasure that was locked within Cosmitalitopia 10,000 years before he was finally freed and fought. During the battle between him and Mario, he reveals everything, including how Mastar was working for him. Eventually, after Mario is knocked out, Megaman765 and Fleskhjerta\u00a0come and throw Cosmicalitaurus into a bomb once each, leading everyone to believe there is hope. Mario then finishes off Cosmicalitaurus, who states that he was blinded by his own power, and would slumber for the rest of his godly life. It is later revealed in The Cosmic Crystals IV: Zythurvia\u00a0that the reason he wanted to change the Star World was because Zythurvion took away from it and made it less beautiful. In the Moon World, he was revealed to have a rivalry with Novuscurous\u00a0and that Geminon really earned his title by defeating Novuscurous. It was also revealed that the Moon World legends are forbidden in the Star World because Cosmicalitaurus would feel like anyone who talks about the Moon World legends is turning on him. Since Novuscurous pinned him and the other two antagonists (Now protagonists) from the previous Cosmic Crystals movies, Bombermoon was able to avoid his seal. However, the Containment Orb sealed Novuscurous and now the Moon World legends are allowed in the Star World.Trivia Starman3  Starman3(also known as SM3 or Jacob) is a SM64 Machinimist on YouTube. \u00a0He is one of the most popular SM64 machimists, alongside MarioMario54321 and supermarioglitchy4.

He first appeared in The Cosmic Crystals IV. He told Hitkid96fan the difference between a cameo and an appearence. TheLuigiRocks is also seen in Into the Fourth Dimension obtaining a D-Star for getting 100 coins on Part 15. He was known as TristanBomber (his new account) at that time.KoopazTroopaz  This is where evil starts to emergeKing Bob-omb (4D)  King Bob-omb (4D) is\u00a0the Fourth Dimension dimensional counterpart of the King Bob-omb from Mario's dimension and his Bob-omberman's best creation (before he created Blowiggler). He was defeated when Mario arrived and attacked, and so he gave Mario a D-Star after that. He resembles the King Bob-omb from the first dimension, but with a few coloration differences, such as the crown. It is unknown if his real name is actually King Bob-omb, as he just goes along with the same name.Dimentio  Dimentio is the primary antagonist from Super Paper Mario. He later returns as the main antagonist of Into the Fourth Dimension. He once was in Count Bleck's Army, but betrayed Bleck and set out to destroy all worlds. He took over Luigi by turning him into Mr. L, like Nastasia did. He, Mr. L and the Chaos Heart all fused into a demonic clown-like monstrosity known as Super Dimentio and planned to continue the apocalypse foretold in the Dark Prognosticus. After Mario and Co. defeated him, he was presumed dead. However, thanks to part of his soul having been used to create Dimension D, he was resurrected and planned revenge on Mario. He eventually found a Dimensional Backtravel Diamond in the Prime Dimension, and used it to travel to the Fourth Dimension, where he would take the Dimension Stars to take over, and destroy all worlds. Mario, Luigi, MarioMario54321, Lily, LuigiGame2, Starman3, and LuigiFan54321 chased him by heading to the Star World (the 2nd Dimension), then Super Mario Star Road (the 3rd Dimension), then, finally, the 4th Dimension. Dimentio weakened the 4th Dimension counterparts of the heroes, trapped them in Dimension D, Made Bob-omberman and Dowser (counterparts of Bomberman and Bowser) his minions, and kidnaped MM's fans and friends. After Mario beat Dowser's Dimensional Swamp, he went into 4D Tower and was kidnaped by Dowser and brainwashed into Mr. M. Later, his minions kidnaped MM and turned him into Mr. Mx2 and, later, Dowser and Bob-omberman quit. The two brainwashed heroes turned back to normal because he hurt Starman3 and almost ended Luigi's game. He then sent Mario and MM to the 4D Game Over Area. When the heroes collected all 120 D-Stars, they confronted Dimentio and he revealed that he wants to build new dimension after he destroys them (destroying them being why Bob-omberman and Dowser quit). Dowser joined Dimentio and they formed Dowmentio. Mario defeated Dowmentio and he was destroyed and split back into Dimentio and Dowser. Then they learned if Dimension D were destroyed, it would in turn kill Dimentio as he is held in existence by it. So the heroes made a plan, after fighting and weakening Dimentio, Mario used the Mega D-Star to obliterate Dimension D, slow erasing Dimentio from existence, thus finally killing him for good. Alternate Forms: Super Dimentio DowmentioThe Top 10 Worst Things That Could Happen to You in Paper Mario  The Top 10 Worst Things That Can Happen to You in Paper Mario is a video that is a Paper Mario Bloopers showing Mario going through the top 10 horrible things that can happen in all three Paper Mario series.

Trivia:SuperMarioGlitchy4  Supermarioglitchy4 (or SMG4 for short) Is a Super Mario 64 Machinimist. He makes Super Mario 64 bloopers which often have an adult theme or jokes that might seem cruel, but these jokes are intended to be humourous and shouldn't be taken seriously. As weird as the bloopers are, SMG4 is a non-homosexual. A few non-retarded people, like MarioMario54321, Starman3, the Dark Star X, and some of MM's non-fantards have made cameo appearances in his bloopers. His wiki is in an alliance with this one.Schm2000  Schm2000 is a YouTuber and fan (but not a noob fan) of MarioMario54321.Roles in Movies: Into the Fourth Dimension:  He was a YouTuber at the Cotton Candy Station in Episode 18 trying to get a D-Star, but couldn't because the Wing Cap blocks weren't turned on. Later, when Luigi turned the Wing Cap Switch on, in Episode 19, Schm is able to get the 96th D-Star.Notes: War of YouTube (MarioMario54321's Appearance)  MarioMario54321 got kidnapped by the Clawdes, but was later freed when Schm refused to kill his friend.

Much later, MarioMario761 saves MM54321 and both fight Death Trapper 8. They both meet with Captain and Runner and head to the Fourth Dimension, seeing that Crownux and QuarioQuario54321 are okay. He later sees MM761 being attacked by Death Trapper 63 and makes DT63 escape. He later finds Starman3 at Blooper Land, seeing that he is okay.

Mario is usually a main character that is usually focused on in MarioMario54321's videos. Personality: In MarioMario54321's videos, Mario can be VERY crazy when he's mad, which usually never happens in the games. He cares about Luigi and MarioMario54321.

He confronted Luigi in Into the Fourth Dimension, wanting revenge about the fact that Luigi was the Counterpart of Fourigi. Eventually he was defeated by him. Like his minions, he has glowing red eyes and teeth that are covered in blood, which is a reference to vampirism. He has a new design that resembles is to date with his Mushroom\u00a0 Kingdom counterpart himself, from Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon. In Back to the Fourth Dimension, he protected the Yellow Rainbow Shard. He sent out Troll Boocula to fight, but Troll Boocula retreated due to Luigi ignoring him. King Boo then had Booclossucula (4D Boolossus) fight Luigi, but Booclossucula lost.LuigiFan54321  LuigiFan54321 is a youtuber. He first starred in Into the Fourth Dimension and helps\u00a0Mario with his journey to beat Dimentio. He uses three Element Stars called the Fire Star, Ice Star and Thunder Star. He also lends the elemental stars to Starman3. He is a good friend of MarioMario54321 and Starman3. Age: 17 (as of 2017,though this was an estimation.)

Those stars were copies of the three X stars that the Star X had created (Thunder, Fire, and Water Star X). Those X Stars were sealed in a stone until a mysterious person got those X Stars and discovered the original versions, which he threw away. LuigiFan learned that someone had thrown those stars away.Forms  Fire LuigiFan54321 (Fire Star) Ice LuigiFan54321 (Ice Star) Thunder LuigiFan54321 (Thunder Star) Chaos LuigiFan54321 (All 3 Element Stars) \u00a0\u00a0", "Brutal Mario Wiki": "Brutal Mario Wiki Demo 7  The Demo 7 is the most widely distributed demo of Super Kitiku Mario. It has 11 worlds and 96 level exits without hacking. This is the most completed demo of all the other official demos, having a major part of the hack it playable. This is the only pre-Athletic Special demo to have an official English version. It's the prequel to the Demo 7.5 and the sequel to the Demo 6.5 .To Be Continued  A To Be Continued level marks the end of the Demo 7\u00a0at either the end of the Star Road or at the end of Bowser's Valley. It is unbeatable and death will ensure after entering it\u00a0without the\u00a0Game Genie code for a keyhole to activate. A Concept art\u00a0of Wendy O. Koopa\u00a0from Super Mario Bros. 3\u00a0is\u00a0in the background\u00a0and Mario dies above the screen because of the lava that is located there, viewable in Lunar Magic.\u00a0To get\u00a0past this inconvenient level and go to the unfinished\u00a0Finish! Bowser Keep\u00a0or the old\u00a0Special Warp Star, use Game Genie code 7E143401 in your Emulator.\u00a0Bonus Worlds  A Bonus World is a world that does not have to be completed in order to reach the To Be Continued Level\u00a0(In Demo 7). Two Bonus Worlds exist. The first one leads to the second one, and beating the second one creates a Warp Pipe in World 1, leading to the Middle path of Luigi's World\u00a0(that was Carol's plan, at least).List of Bonus Worlds Star Road  The\u00a0Star Road is a world that is shaped like an X and is full of Warp Star levels. If the player beats one of these levels via the normal exit, the path to the next level will be unlocked, if the player beats the level via Secret Exit, the level will turn into a Warp Star leading to the corresponding world. The second-to-last star is a To Be Continued Level in Demo 7. The Warp Star that leads to the Special World has a unfinished Star Boss.Levels: Special World  The\u00a0Special Zone is a world that can be accessed by completing the Secret Exit of Special Warp Star. Most of Special World's levels are glitchy or incomplete and with nothing special at the end (In Demo 7). When the player beats the last level of the Special World, the Overworld's colors change and the Yoshi's House changes to a level with many toads and dead Yoshis. Beating the Toad's House will unlock the pipe that leads to middle path in Luigi's World.Levels: Graphics and Music  The graphics used in the Star Road are from the game . The graphics in the Special World are taken from . The music played in the Star Road is \"Corridors of Time\" from Chrono Trigger. The music on the Special World map is \"The Opening of a Journey\" from SaGa Frontier.Forest  The forest (\u3057\u3093\u308a\u3093, shinrin) is the second world on Kitiku Island. It has 10 levels: seven normal ones, two ghost houses (one ghost house and one fortress in Demo 6 and 7), and one castle.Geography  The forest is considerably larger than the previous World. The world starts with a short bridge, leading towards a Ghost House, with an expanse forest behind it. Towards south are some beach cliffs, where Morton's Castle and another ghost house (a fortress in Demo 7) reside.Levels Secret Levels Scrapped Levels Bosses Graphics & Music  The overworld uses graphics from several of Chrono Trigger's world maps, with the cliffside using graphics from the 65000000 BC (Prehistory) map, the World number signs using the tablet graphics (that point out the time period Crono and his party are at), and the remainder of the graphics coming from the 1000 AD (Present) map. The Overworld uses Peaceful Days from\u00a0Chrono Trigger as its background music.Trivia Carol  Carol\u00a0- also\u00a0known as carol0151 or\u00a0dragon\u00a0-\u00a0is a Japanese hacker from Tokyo, who created Brutal Mario/Super Kitiku Mario.About  He is a rather reclusive hacker, preferring to stay in the shadows most of the time, rather than constantly post on SMW hacking sites and 2ch's SMW hacking threads, making him quite the mystery amongst the SMW hacking scene. He seems to have some skill with programming languages, notably Assembly and Perl (the latter of which was used to make Carol's addmusic). Outside of that, he enjoys speedrunning games and contributing to Yaruo threads in 2ch's news board.Their \"legacy\" amongst the SMW hacking scene  Due to the massive amount of custom sprites and bosses included in their romhack, in a time where things like that weren't as common in SMW hacks as they are today, Carol was basically put in a pedestal by SMW hackers during the late 2000s.\u00a0 His lacking level design has been the target of criticism, however, which has resulted in Carol planning to remake most of the hack's levels for the final version.\u00a0 Some of his custom bosses do make appearances in other hacks as well, as Carol released all of the ones in the cheap demo in a zip folder named data.zip. Said zip also contained all the custom music in the cheap demo and all custom sprites.\u00a0 Carol also made his own update of addmusic, a program, originally created by another Japanese hacker, that allows hackers to add custom music to SMW. This was the first of a bunch of updates that would come to the tool (Romi's AddmusicM, HuFlungDu's Addmusic 4.05 and Kipernal's AddmusicK).\u00a0 He has also contributed custom overworld sprites. Sadly, these don't really get much use.\u00a0VIP and Wall Mix  Carol has also contributed to the VIP and Wall and Alaska Mix games, starting with VIP2, where he contributed four levels, which would be later reused in Brutal Mario: Skull Coaster, The World! Time Stop, Mirror Fort and Ghost Coaster. He also contributed the Giko Bowser (based on Bowser from Mario 3) and Neo VIPdeath (based on Neo Exdeath from Final Fantasy V) bosses.\u00a0 With VIP3, he contributed the Banana Bird crystal minigame, the Mega Man 6 capsule room and the final bosses: Daddy Cool riding Gamma (from Mega Man 3) and Newsoku de Yaruo (based on Zero Two from Kirby 64), all in Bowser's Castle.\u00a0 With VIP4, he contributed the Yoshi chimera boss (an original boss) and the Seven AA boss (based on The Seven Heroes from Romancing SaGa 2)\u00a0 With VIP5, he contributed the Red Switch Palace, Red Athletic and one of the stages in World 8, Little Zonu Lost. He also made the Tanasinn boss and worked on the coding for the Julius (from Final Fantasy Adventure) boss, the graphics being made by Homing and the music being made by 757, two other Japanese hackers.\u00a0 For VIP6, he hasn't contributed anything thus far. It is assumed that he might not do anything for this one, due to the vague wording of a previous email.\u00a0Interests Links Grasslands  The grasslands(\u305d\u3046\u3052\u3093, sougen) are the first world on Kitiku Island. It consists of 8 levels: five normal levels, one castle, the Blue Switch Palace and Yoshi's House.Geography  \ufeffThe grasslands are very small compared to other worlds on Kitiku Island. It is a small meadow with a beach on the south side and a plateau on the east side. Yoshi's House is located in the center and Lemmy's Castle is on the plateau.Levels Secret Levels Scrapped Levels Bosses Graphics & Music  The overworld uses graphics from several of Chrono Trigger's world maps, with the mountain's cliffside using graphics from the 65000000 BC (Prehistory) map, the World number signs using the tablet graphics (that point out the time period Crono and his party are at), and the remainder of the graphics coming from the 1000 AD (Present) map. The Overworld uses Peaceful Days from\u00a0Chrono Trigger as its background music.Trivia Boss  A Boss is an especially powerful enemy that will be found in certain rooms on\u00a0several of the\u00a0levels. Brutal Mario is well known for its large amount of bosses, most of which come from different games. An asterisk (*) next to the boss' name means that boss is still incomplete, a cross in the # table means the boss has been removed in later versions and a\u00a0? in the # table means it is unknown where the boss battle takes place. In addition, Carol has plans to remake the Wendy, Iggy, Doom Wall, Larry and Big Bad Kirby battles.VIP and Wall Mix Bosses VIP and Wall Mix 2 VIP and Wall Mix 3 VIP and Wall and Alaska Mix 4 VIP and Wall and Alaska Mix 5 Trivia Warp Star  A Warp Star is a type of transportation in Brutal Mario. Level Warp Stars are common in Kirby Games. There two different types of Warp Stars: Warp Stars found on the World Map, and ones found in the levels themselves.Types of Warp Stars \ufeffWorld Map  Several Warp Stars can be found on the world map. Each Warp Star is hidden in a different world. To find them, the player must find the secret exit leading to them. Each Warp Star will lead to the Star Road. Once in the Star Road, there will be two different type of stars: active and inactive Warp Stars. An inactive Warp Star will take the player to a level. There will be two different exits: There are also two other types: The To Be Continued (In the Demo 7)\u00a0and the\u00a0Special Warp Star. The To Be Continued Warp Star is an unfinished level in the Demo 7 and the only way to beat it is by hacking. And The Special Warp Star is the only Warp Star that will lead to the Special Zone, it's a level in wich the player has a unlimited star power in the first section, and at the end of the second section is a door that leads to the unfinished Star boss.Levels  They can be found in 2 levels: In Battleship Halberd, the player will find a Warp Star from the Kirby Series, it will take the player to Meta Knight's Airship. On Valley Star, there are multiple colored Warp Stars that will take Mario to another part of the level. There are also some stars that resembles the Warp Star in Athletic Special, but they will block the player's view instead of taking Mario to another part of the level.Legend  The world map shows Mario's journey and progress. So far, there are 90 levels in the entire game(91 if you count the alternate Yoshi's House as a separate stage). Here is a legend of the world map:2011-05-02 1931.png Yoshi's House  Yoshi's House is, well, Yoshi's house, and also the first level in Brutal Mario. Although it looks innocent enough, it is raided by the Mushroom Kingdom army after the Special Zone is completed.The Level  Yoshi's House is made up of a mailbox, a fireplace, a chimney, and a roof made out of trees. The roof just happens to be covered in berries, as well. In the middle, there is a Hint Block which will display a note from Yoshi asking for Mario to stay away from him. In later demos, there is also a lavender-colored door, leading to one of Vivian's Shops, where Mario can buy various hints and upgrades. Outside of the shop, it didn't change much from SMW. To exit, merely walk offscreen.Vivian's Shop inventory (later demos only) Shoot two fireballs  Allows Mario to have up to two fireballs on screen instead of just one. Costs 200 coins.Start with 20 lives  As getting 100 coins won't give you lives (since they'll be used to buy things at Vivian's shop), this makes it so that you start with 20 lives whenever you load a save file or start a new game, instead of starting with just 5. Costs 200 coins.Lively Water hint  A hint on how to find the secret exit in Lively Water. Costs 2000 coins.Level Up!  Raises Mario's level up by one. Will allow him to shoot fireballs faster, deal more damage to bosses and gain longer invincibility time. Costs\u00a0??? coins. (it's at 0 in demoOnly1, but you can't afford it)Graphic and Music Sources Graphics  The graphics are from Super Mario World. Vivian's shop uses graphics from Kirby's Dream Course, while Vivian's sprite is from Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door.Music  The music in Yoshi's House is \"Here We Go!\" from Super Mario World. Vivian's shop uses \"Holiday in the Village\" from Treasure of the Rudras.Trivia Start.png Locations  Any area Mario traverses in the Brutal Mario saga.New pages  New pages on the wiki.WelcomeIP/doc Templates  There are many templates in use in Brutal Mario Wiki; these are only a subset, representing some of the most important and commonly used ones. If you feel that a template belongs on this page, do not hesitate to add it.What are templates?  Wiki templates provide a means to insert the same content over and over in different (or the same) pages.

It's time to head out and find the answers.\" - Official summary found on Cry of Fear's Mod page Cry of Fear is a total modification of Half-Life 1, and the second modification developed by Team Psykskallar, the same team behind \"Afraid of Monsters.\" It was released February 22, 2012. The story takes place in Faversholm, Sweden, with a nineteen-year-old boy by the name of Simon who serves as the main playable protagonist. As the events of \"Cry of Fear\" unfold, many traits and relevant characters pertaining to Simon are revealed, exerting one of four main endings (seven total) that bring the whole game together. These endings rely entirely on the player's decisions in specific given events.Awards Characters (Cry of Fear) Simon Henriksson  Simon is a 19 year old male and the protagonist of Cry of Fear. He is an individual plagued with anxiety and depression, little being known about his school or home life - something his doctor notes are topics Simon refuses to discuss. It is known that Simon lives with his mother, no mention made of a father or other relatives. His only friend outside his home appears to be his friend Sophie, whom he harbors a secret interest in. His surname is apparently \"Henriksson\" because the name \"Simon Henriksson\" is the name on the Hidden Package. Before the events of Cry of Fear, as witnessed in a cutscene, Simon was the victim of a hit and run wherein he was pinned to a building by a car whilst trying to help an injured man late at night. While he surprisingly survived the incident, he was crippled from the waist down and confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life, subjecting him to further mental trauma which drove him into becoming reclusive and Bloodredrust. Doctor Purnell was assigned as Simon's psychiatrist following the accident, and he made the decision to recommend Simon try a new form of cognitive therapy. Simon was instructed to write a book on his feelings and emotions to get all the trauma out of his head. Simon set to work as instructed and the events of Cry of Fear begin - the events unfolding being a metaphorical depiction of Simon's mind and his battle to purge his inner demons whilst writing, the actions taken during the game showing how well the therapy works. The Simon played as over the course of Cry of Fear is in fact a mental projection of Simon and what combats the trauma inside the real one's mind. The fate of both the Simons depends on what ending is unlocked due to the players actions. In the first three endings of the game, there is slight variation on the fates of the other characters around Simon. The real Simon ending his own life is shown metaphorically in his mind as the projection Simon is subjected to another nightmare, forced to work his way to the real Simon still stuck in his wheelchair. A fight ensues that ends with the fake Simon mercilessly beating the real Simon unconscious before strangling him to death, killing himself in the process and ending the game with one of the first three endings. Ending 1: This ending is unlocked if Simon spared the life of Carcass and refused to show trust in Doctor Purnell in the asylum. The therapy fails outright and Simon develops a deep hatred for the world around him, the book having a negative affect and setting him on the road to self-destruction. In spite for those around him, Simon murders the real Doctor Purnell in his apartment and butchers Sophie, putting her body in his bathtub. He then commits suicide following finishing his book, his body discovered by the police soon after. Ending 2: This ending is unlocked if Simon spared the life of Carcass, but trusted Doctor Purnell and gave him the gun he requested. In this ending, Simon shows respect for Purnell and his efforts to help Simon - but ultimately believes it was futile, coming to the resolution that his life means nothing now. Due to the guilt caused by his issues with Sophie still existing due to Carcass being left alive, Simon is unable to leave her for someone else to have once he is gone and murders her in his home before committing suicide as the police arrive. Ending 3: This ending is unlocked if Simon killed Carcass, but refused to give Doctor Purnell his gun. This is the opposite of the second ending, Simon having murdered Doctor Purnell like in the first ending but sparing Sophie due to the elimination of his guilt and attachment. Simon comes to regard Sophie as the only person who ever truly tried to help him and in his last statements before shooting himself, Simon requests that whoever reads his book spares her the horror of what happened to him. Ending 4: The 'good ending' is unlocked by killing Carcass and trusting Doctor Purnell with the gun. In this ending, Simon did not murder anyone and does not commit suicide, instead being prevented from doing so by a psychosis induced hallucination where the fake Simon arrives. The real Simon works his way through another nightmare whilst in his wheelchair and engages his mental counterpart in a running gunfight, before eventually triumphing and shooting his own nightmarish visage to death - showing that he no longer needs it. The psychosis ends and it is revealed that Simon did not really shoot his twisted self - but rather two police officers who were entering his room. Doctors testified that Simon was having a psychosis and although he feels great guilt for killing the officers, he is instead committed to a mental hospital for what is foreseeable to be the rest of his life. Doctor Purnell continues to act as Simon's counselor and mentor, a service he is grateful for. Sophie regularly visits Simon in the hospital when she is allowed, and although Simon makes note of the fact that she has found a new male friend, he wishes her nothing but the best. Co-Op: Although the canon nature of the co-op ending is put into question in the Cry of Fear storyline, the campaign concludes with a scene of the police managing to reach the location where Simon was hit by the car prior to the events of the game just moments before Simon was hit. They arrest the driver and thus prevent Simon ever being crippled, preventing the events of the game entirely. A short a scene is then shown of Simon having apparently begun a relationship with Sophie walking down the sidewalk with her, holding hands. Simon is voiced by Stig \"DragonNOR\" Sydtangen from ModDb.Doctor Purnell  Also known simply as 'The Doctor', Purnell is the main antagonist during the events of Cry of Fear alongside the abominations Simon is subjected to fighting. In reality is a psychiatrist, the Doctor Purnell witnessed during the events of the game a mere depiction of him in Simon's mind - his malicious and sadistic behavior mirroring Simon's potential view of Purnell as being an strange and untrustworthy man. Following Simon's accident that confined him to a wheelchair, Purnell was hired as Simon's counselor to keep track of his mental progress due to the trauma he endured. Purnell notes that Simon is loath to speak of his personal life, refusing to comment on topics regarding his home or school life. Due to little success in their sessions, he recommends Simon try a form of cognitive therapy by writing a book to express his thoughts and emotions, to get them out of his head. This suggestion leads to the events of the game, a depiction of Simon's mental struggle against his inner demons. A twisted version of Purnell in a gasmask is seen in this world, dropping false hints to Simon about a possible biological outbreak - the Doctor expressing belief that Simon isn't even real, and that everyone else around him is psychotic despite the fact he murders two individuals in cold blood. Simon comes to believe that the Doctor is responsible for all of this and chases him to a mental asylum located deep in the forest, the Doctor eventually making contact with Simon and offering to open a gate for him in exchange for Simon handing over a pistol located in the asylum's bowling alley. The players choice decides what ending is unlocked - if the player gives Purnell the gun, he thanks Simon for his trust and gives him the key to the gate before loading the pistol and shooting him in the shoulder. If Simon refuses to give him the gun he expresses disappointment in Simon before tossing him the key anyways, shortly after still shooting him with his snub-nose revolver. After the encounter by the gate, Simon pursues Purnell up to the attic of the asylum and engages him in a gunfight. The battle eventually ends in Simon's victory, the Doctor laying wounded on the ground before Simon approaches him and finishes him off by stomping on his face multiple times, crushing his skull in and destroying his mask. Following the conclusion of the game, the ending unlocked decides the fate of the real Doctor Purnell. If Simon chose to not trust him with the gun, either Ending 1 or Ending 3 is unlocked - in which Simon murders Purnell in his apartment, regarding his attempts at helping him either to be done out of spite or simply to be useless, respectfully. But if Simon trusts him with the gun, Ending 2 or Ending 4 are unlocked. In Ending 2 Simon commits suicide following his murder of Sophie and he openly states his apologies to Purnell in the final notes of his book, stating that not everyone can be saved. In Ending 4 Simon does not kill himself and is instead convicted to a mental hospital following a psychosis that causes him to accidentally shoot two police officers. Purnell then becomes Simon's official mentor in the asylum, working to bring Simon back to mental health - something that Simon is grateful for. Upon completing the game in any ending will unlock \"Doctor Mode\". You play as Doctor Purnell, armed with a snub-nose revolver and equipped with a nightvision built-in gasmask. He will have to battle through armies of monsters created by Simon's mind in order to get into the apartment which Simon lives in, to destroy the book Simon has written. He is voiced by Lasse \"BerZerK89\" Holmen from ModDB.Sophie  Sophie is a close friend of Simon's from school and is Simon's hidden love intrest. How Simon met her is never specifically stated, but Sophie states that she always had problems at school - hinting she was a victim of bullying by others, and that Simon was the only boy who was kind to her. Although Simon states his love for her, Sophie does not seem to fully return those feelings, stating she regards him as a good friend, and nothing beyond that. Despite this, it appears that at some point before the events of Cry of Fear, the real Simon confessed his true nature to Sophie shortly before his accident - but she rejected him. This caused him to suffer grief, likely leading to the creation of Carcass in his mind, the monster serving as an incarnation of Simon's accumulated guilt and sorrow. During the events of the game whilst Simon's mental projection works his way through what he perceives to be a city swarmed with monsters, a depiction of Sophie in Simon's mind contacts him and asks to meet him on a nearby rooftop. Simon meets her there soon after where she expresses shock at Simon's statements regarding monsters, claiming she has no idea what he is describing. The two have a short conversation on the rooftops where Simon once more tries to confess his feelings to her - though he is once again only met with denial due to her regarding him as a friend. Shortly after the conversation begins to draw to a close, Sophie expresses her desire to get away from everything around them. Simon fails to understand her meaning, before she abruptly walks over the edge of the rooftop and commits suicide, dying on the pavement below. The act can be seen as a metaphorical representation of how Simon's mind perceives her turning her back on him, her death causing as much grief to Simon as her denying him in the real world. This causes Carcass to appear and Simon can either chose to flee the creature and let the guilt fester, or kill it and end his sorrow for Sophie once and for all. The fate of the real Sophie is decided in the ending of the game. If Carcass was left alive, then either Ending 1 or Ending 2 are unlocked, both endings showing that Simon murdered Sophie and stashed her body away amongst a large amount of blood in his bathtub before killing himself. But if Carcass is killed, then either Ending 3 or Ending 4 are accessed. In Ending 3 Simon murders Doctor Purnell before killing himself, though he continues to show great appreciation for Sophie's efforts to help him and in his final notes he requests that whoever reads his book spares her having to know what truly happened to him. In Ending 4, Simon is prevented from committing suicide and following his entry into a mental hospital following the accidental murder of two police officers, Sophie continues to regularly visit him for support. Simon states that although she pretends what has happened to him has done little to hurt her, he can see a great deal of pain in her eyes when she's with him. This likely led her to find a new male friend to be with, Simon hinting she is in a relationship with him. The canonical status of the co-op campaign is questioned, though the ending offers a different take on the story. In the ending, the Swedish police manage to prevent Simon from ever being crippled prior to the events of the game, causing none of the occurrences to ever take place. After Simon is saved a short scene plays showing that Simon and Sophie have apparently begun a relationship and are seen walking down the sidewalk together,holding hands, apparently in an relationship. She is voiced by Aina Hatlevik.Police  The cops are members of the Swedish police force and serve as the protagonists of the co-op campaign. After becoming interested in Simon's case and reading his book, they eventually become sucked into the world his book created and begin a journey to prevent the events of Cry of Fear from ever occuring by preventing Simon's crippling accident. They are voiced by Ian \"Dr.Doozer\" Wiese.David Leatherhoff  After the Secret 5th Ending, it is revealed (albeit noncanon) that it was David Leatherhoff who ranover Simon. After Simon has a nightmare similar to that of David Leatherhoff's, he wakes up to find out he was ran over by David. In a strange scene, it appears that Simon knows David. David apologizes for running over Simon, \"Sorry man, I'm fucking stoned.\", to which Simon threatens \"Oh you're gonna regret this! You're gonna regret this big time!\". From there, David runs away, as Simon demands that he comes back.Carcass (Cry of Fear Boss)  The Carcass is the third boss in Cry of Fear, being fought at the end of chapter three on the rooftops. Carcass is a bloated piece of rotten meat stuck to a chair held in the air by several chains that hover above him. He appears to be a symbol of Simon's grief - primarily in regards to Sophie herself, connecting Sophie's eventual fate in the ending heavily to the creatures own. Its design also implies connection to Simon's crippled state, as it is confined to a chair and unable to move without the aid of the chains. His attacks are similar to two creatures from Afraid of Monsters: Director's Cut, the Bleeding Specter and secondarily the Launcher Ghost, in which he fires ghostly projectiles towards the player that track his movements and are difficult to dodge. Due to the difficulty in avoiding his attacks and the high amount of damage it causes, Carcass can be a very lethal foe for players who are inexperienced in fighting him. Once killed, Carcass falls limp in his chair and the chains lose their flight, the creature and its chair falling to the ground below and vanishing. For those who do not wish to fight him, it is possible to flee through a nearby window and cause Carcass to simply vanish. Though whether or not Simon chooses to kill Carcass is tied into what ending they receive regarding Sophie - if Carcass is spared, then Simon's guilt and depression associated with her continues to fester until he spitefully or possessively murders her in two of the four endings. The other two are achieved by killing Carcass, which will cause Simon to find peace with Sophie. It is also possible the monster represents Simon, and his disability to walk since the creature sits in a chair, has no feet, and cant walk. Simon mentions that he feels he's just a sitting piece of meat in a chair. In which case, could represent the meaning of this monster, as if the chains represent how Simon feels he is \"tied down\" because he cannot walk, maybe that could be why if you kill the Carcass, you finally find peace with Sophie and accept your problem.Sawrunner (Cry of Fear monster)  The Sawrunner is a fast, chainsaw wielding psychopath with three theatre masks around his face, disguising his face completely. He is encountered in Cry of Fear, serving as more of a hazard than an actual enemy to be fought. He is encountered on multiple occasions in the singleplayer mode, is met on three separate instances in the doctor mode, and is an actual boss in co-op fought in the forest segment. In all his appereances, he is quite the challenge, for his screaming and loud noises tend to put the players in a very alert state. Simon is meant to flee from this creature as opposed to standing and fighting; a single strike from this creature's chainsaw is enough to kill\u00a0Simon instantly. Due to the monster's speed, it can easily catch up with the player during a chase, making the shortest break in walking a death sentence. Therefore, using morphine can save the player's life, as it both heals and refills the stamina. It is possible to kill the Sawrunner, although it is a challege to do so, due to the creature having an almost ludicrous amount of health (2,000, to be exact). You will not have enough ammo to kill the creature unless you have the maximum amount of ammo for one or two of your guns, however, your reward for doing so is nothing more than to not have to run from him for that specific encounter. If he is killed, the creature will still appear later on during other chases. You can also freeze him with the Camera. When this monster is fought as a boss in co-op, its health bar shares the same name as its singleplayer counterpart, Sawer.Relevance to Simon  The Sawrunner's masks could easily represent the false happiness Simon displays which conceal his true depressed identity. His clothes are similar to Simon's but covered with blood, hinting the bad endings of the single player campaign where Simon murders his doctor or Sophie out of bitterness or possessiveness. Sawrunner's fast running speed which forces the player to flee from him alludes to the fact Simon is still trying to run from his fears rather than face them, his insanity catching up to him everytime he distances himself from it and himself.Appearances and Locations Tactics and Strategies  Though the Sawrunner is frightening and extremely quick, there are some tactics you may want to use to outsmart him:Afraid of Monsters: Director's Cut  You do drugsAdded Content Plot  David Leatherhoff was a man addicted to a new painkiller from an 'unidentified' company In a few days,he started to have bad nightmares and started to see things he has never seen in the real world. he then expriences something that was disturbing and was not right,he started to see disturbing creatures,in another few days,he headed to the bathroom,he wanted to get more of the painkillers,he then finds the disturbing creatures,he needed to do something. The game ends depending on what you did when you went in those directions <u>Alternate Endings 3 bad endings 1 good ending, you need to play this 3 times to look for hidden notes/pages in the game which spells out FORGIVE ME Ending 1 - David wakes up in a house,the camera then cuts to corpses of dead people,David then realizes,the things he had been killing were infact,innocent people,David was then arrested Ending 2 - David was interviewed by an Police Officer,in a few moments,he enrages Ending 3 - One of the guards was reading a newspaper that read:\"Killer claims over 20 lives\",he then walks to David's cell,David commited suicide by hanging himself while inside the cell Ending 4 -Reception  Upon release, AoM:DC garnered even more praise than its other version, Afraid of Monsters (Original). Very rarely did it receive negative feedback, of which mostly had to do with the accessibility and questionable usefulness of the in-game flashlight, the use of cutscenes and the repetitive nature of the game on some occasions.Trivia Sawer (Cry of Fear Boss)  Sawer is the first boss that the player encounters in Cry of Fear. He is confronted\u00a0at\u00a0the\u00a0conclusion\u00a0of\u00a0Chapter\u00a01\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0sub\u00a0levels\u00a0of the\u00a0apartments,\u00a0although\u00a0he\u00a0is\u00a0seen\u00a0close\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0beginning.\u00a0He is a\u00a0very\u00a0tall and thin creature, almost skeletal in appearance\u00a0and\u00a0wields\u00a0a\u00a0large chainsaw\u00a0which\u00a0he\u00a0is\u00a0named after. Sawer also\u00a0has\u00a0multiple nails and\u00a0pins\u00a0protruding\u00a0from\u00a0his\u00a0head and\u00a0other\u00a0areas\u00a0of\u00a0his\u00a0body. Simon confronts him during his first severe nightmare, Sawer will ambush Simon once he enters his lair and cut a steam pipe across the door, trapping Simon in the room with him. He will then pursue Simon relentlessly around the room, moving fairly slowly but taking large steps that allow him to keep pace with the player. If he gets a chance to attack the player, his preparation to swing the chainsaw is slow enough that it is possible to avoid. If the player manages to get caught in a corner, however, they have little chance of escape. Being struck once by the chainsaw\u00a0is an instant kill and a special animation from a third person perspective, and results in Simon being brutally chopped in half at the waist. Sawer is immune to all forms of damage Simon can give him for most of the battle, his only weak spot being a closed eye protruding from his upper back. The only way to reveal the eye is to damage him until he finally wears down and falls to one knee to rest. The eye will then open and Simon can attack it for a few seconds before Sawer stands to his feet once more and resumes the battle. Once enough damage has been done to the eye, Sawer will succumb to the damage and fall to his knees before purposely decapitating himself with his own chainsaw as the nightmare and chapter ends. Sawer could represent Simon's self-harming and suicidal tendencies. He has pins nailed in various spots around his body in a voodoo doll fashion and a blood stain under his neck that was most likely caused by a cut(s) done by himself. This becomes clear when one defeats Sawer, as it is he who kills himself, not the player. Simon's self-harming tendencies can be seen during the syringe animation, as several cuts on his left wrist are shown.Mace (Cry of Fear Boss)  \"All I wanted to know is where the key was!\" -Doctor Purnell Mace is the second boss in Cry of Fear, found in the Sewers near the end of Chapter 2. He is a large foe, being considerably taller than Simon, has a bloated tongue that hangs from his mouth, legs that fold in on themselves as he walks, and bears several bandages across his body that also cover his eyes. He is named after the large spiked Mace he carries, which has the power to kill Simon with one hit if he is not careful during the fight.  Mace appears once The Doctor has fled from Simon after beheading a man he was torturing for the location of a key. As Mace appears, he reveals that he has the key, and swallows it before the fight begins. He moves very slowly and is most likely unable to see because of the bandages covering his eyes, often stopping for several moments as if to 'sniff out' Simon before resuming chase. It can also be assumed that Mace is able to locate his prey through hearing, as Simon will make plenty of noise whilst moving through the partially flooded room. Despite his handicaps, Mace is completely immune to all of Simon's weapons (not even Simon's Book can hurt him). The only way to kill Mace is to turn the valves found around the walls of the room to power up its respective generator, which will emit an electric shock through the water. Simon will have to power up several generators in order to kill Mace, moving quickly to avoid Mace's attacks and get on dry ground before the generators emit their charge. It is advisable to lure Mace away from the valve currently being turned as it takes a long time for the generator to engage, and the number of shocks needed to kill him depends on the difficulty the player chose at the beginning of the game. After Mace is killed, his fried body will still pose a problem because of the key he swallowed - forcing Simon to locate a nearby hand saw in the next room and cut into the corpse's stomach to retrieve the key in order to continue further on.Trivia Twitcher  The Twitcher, popularly known as \"zombies\", are the main enemies in both the original Afraid of Monsters and the Director's cut. Twitchers come in a multitude of different styles including twitchers with lab coats, or twitchers with a missing head. They make a certain growling sound effect when the player is near. Its attacks include swinging it arms, using its head against the player or even biting the player. Most Variations are particularly fast, moving adeptly and in a fast twitching manner, hence their name (in original version however twitchers are slow just like headcrab zombies from Half-Life). Each twitcher also has its own unique stats, all having different range, attack damage, and health. Twitchers are actually retextured and recoded zombies from the mod, They Hunger, as stated by the developer, Andreas R\u00f6nnberg.\u00a0Variations  There are a few variations of\u00a0twitchers\u00a0seen throughout the entire game (some of them appear only in Director's Cut):Trivia Images  Cite error:  tags exist, but no  tag was foundBleeding Specter  Bleeding specter , otherwise known as \"The Flashing Specter\" or \"The Face\", is an enemy that appears in the original Afraid of Monsters and the Director's Cut. It is invisible to player initially, but once it attacks it reveals itself, appearing as a ghostly face with ghastly features. Its main attack is firing eyeballs that home in on the player, and it will flash its appearance every time it fires. It is also capable of melee attacks, but will remain invisible. It is recommended to use the Desert Eagle to take it down to reduce the damage the monster can inflict on the player.Trivia Abomination  The Abomination is a dark, fleshy, spider-like creature, which appears to have human head that is first encountered shortly after the player escapes the Hospital. It has a sting attack that causes the player to become poisoned, leeching away health points for a few seconds and causes the player to become temporarily deaf, with the only audible noise being a ringing, tinnitus like sound. It moves rather slowly and has a moderate amount of hit points. The Abomination has no apparent weaknesses, as it consists entirely of a huge body made up of twisted legs. The Abomination is actually a remake of the Vortigaunt from Half Life. The poisonous attack is similar to the Vortigaunt's electricution effect. In the original Afraid of Monsters, the Abomination appeared to be a retextured Vortigaunt and the ranged electrical attack, in contrast to the one with the Director's Cut, which only uses melee contact.Weapons (Cry of fear)  There are many types of weapons in Cry of Fear. Here are the weapons known so far.Melee Weapons  Fists/Pistol Whip Pros: Cons: Switchblade Pros: Cons: Nightstick Pros: Cons: Branch A misc. melee weapon. Found in the woods in chapter 6.

The story behind the line of co-op maps is that a group of Swedish police officers read \"Simon's Book\" and fight their way backwards through the original SP campaign to stop Simon from being hit by the car being driven by an unknown individual in the beginning of the main story, which originally causes a \"spiral of events\" that spawn the \"arcane creations that his book had\". You can have up to 4 players, but you can also play alone without problems, as there are no points in co-op that require two or more players. In co-op, several features from the SP campaign are missing, like combining items, dual wielding, unlocks, and tape-recorder saving. However, all the players have a full-strength flashlight on their vest which never runs out of battery and can be used at any time by pressing F, plus players can revive each other at any time using CPR.Plot  The Game starts with a friend or a group, playing as a team of Swedish police officers who have read and entered Simon's Book. They aim to prevent the crash and change Simon's future, while fighting his monsters. The campaign starts in the Suburbs at night during a thunderstorm, in front of Simon's house. The doors are locked and won't budge. A large amount of Twitchers and Flygares eventually appear, along with Tallers and a Sawcrazy. Roads are blocked by vehicles, thus forcing the team to go through the Sewers and other underground passes, encountering aquatic twitchers and other monsters on their way. After exiting the underground, they must cross the lake, which now has boardwalks, while being attacked by Tallers, Crazyrunners and a very large amount of Watros. The team must then traverse the Forest and Asylum, coming across a blocked highway and through another series of Forests. This is were the team will encounter the Saw Runner, who must be killed. The team eventually reach the abandoned train and proceed to ride it back to where it came from. While on the train, the team is attacked by Spitters and Twitchers. The team arrives in the subway and are attacked by Suiciders\u00a0; they then exit the subway into the City, fighting a large array of monsters on their way. The team enters the same park as Simon did and can optionally complete the puzzle to obtain four sniper rifles and a sledgehammer. At this point, they must go through a series of apartments, another part of the city and back into the subway. When the team exits the subway, they come across an empty street with ominously clicking pedestrian crossings. When one of the team walks far enough up the street, a cut-scene plays\u00a0: Simon sees a group of police officers(the players) arresting the driver in the car, which ultimately prevents Simon from being hit and crippled. The cut-scene then shows Simon and Sophie walking together while holding hands. Then the credit rolls. (This is probably the only true \"happy ending\" of the entire game.)Chapters  The Cry Of Fear SP Campaign and the Co-op Storyline are both made up of Chapters and Co-op continues on straight after SP and continues counting from Chapter 8. The chapters will continue in chronological order, but the next chapter marks a start in a whole other different campaign in the game (only in Multiplayer Co-op). [Misc Info: When Patch 1.2 was released the MP campaign was split into 4 chapters, where before there were none at all.]CPR/Respawning  Should someone go down in co-op team-mates can revive one another using CPR by holding E on their body. You can do this an infinite amount of times leaving the revived player with 10 HP. If you aren't revived in set amount of time set by the server owner, you respawn and lose all your previous inventory, giving CPR does not pause this timer. You are not invulnerable while giving CPR to a downed team-mate (This changed with the 1.3 update). A downed player can also open their inventory and drop items, allowing them to save their rarer weapons from the inventory reset when you respawn.(You can no longer do this if you update to 1.2)Communication  The voice communication in the game, originally bound to K, has a radio sound effect upon starting and stopping communicaton, like a radio. You can chat at any time without specialty items, and there doesn't seem to be a distance limit with communication. Originally players communicated through an actual handheld radio which other players could only hear if they were in close proximity.Nightmare Simon  At random times throughout the co-op campaign, the screen will go black and white and a haunting ambience of what seems to be Simon screaming \"I'm sick\" and \"Kill yourself\" plays.\u00a0 During this, any door which would otherwise initiate a map change becomes mysteriously jammed, and a nightmare version of Simon with a shotgun hunts the players. Nightmare Simon is the same enemy you face in the last chapter (provided you went with ending 4). He has a overall bloody and grungy look to him like the other enemies in the game. Although he walks very slow, and is not very fast with his turning, Nightmare Simon never misses with his shotgun and it deals around 10-20 damage with each shot. He can take a large amount of damage (something like 2+ full glock mags) before hitting a certain damage roof and disappearing, along with removing the black and white effect, ambience and unjamming the map transition doors. As of patch 1.3 Simon now has a health bar when he appears giving the officers an insight on how damaged he is.Death/Saving  If all the players in the game die, a 'game over' will appear on everyone's screen, and the map will restart from it's beginning, typically from where everyone spawned after the last map change. After this restart, all players will lose their previous inventories and will start with a new random set of equipment, from a tree branch to a shotgun. There is no saving in co-op, and if you were to shut down the server mid-campaign, you'd have to restart from the beginning unless you used the console to start the server and had memorized the map name you were on. Also, due to the fact that ammo is not an inventory item and you cannot drop it, any extra ammo you have that isn't 'bound' to a weapon (Ex. Holding shotgun shells without a shotgun) will be lost upon revival, respawning, or map change.New Features Handcrab  The Handcrab is an enemy encountered in Afraid Of Monsters. It is a remodel of the Headcrab in Half Life and resembles a decapitated, rotten head, with a hand coming out of its mouth. It appears pale and has blood running down from its eye sockets and across the hand. It will attack by jumping at the player, inflicting damage if it is close to you. After landing, it has a short cooldown before it can jump again. If it landed behind the player, it will take a short time to turn towards you and then jump again.Trivia The Addiction  The Addiction is the final boss of Afraid of Monsters: Director's Cut. It appears to be a clone of David with the eyes gouged out, its face bloodied and pale, and a large hole in its chest. It is only found in the map: \"4mother\" after unlocking the Forgive Me door. Its name makes it an obvious personification of David's addiction to painkillers.The Duel  After unlocking the door with the completed code (which spells out FORGIVE ME) David discovers a twisted version of Markland Hospital, consisting of hallways set up in various angles. Climbing his way through, he goes through another nightmare zone, where he finds a house with a painting showing him how to escape. On the table, there is a note, saying that \"My mother used to point at things she wanted me to destroy.\", and the said painting points at the ceiling. After cutting a hole in the ceiling, he climbs up to find an old attic. The next note says that \"Now she is pointing at your enemy.\", then a Twitcher breaks into the room and David kills it. Entering the hallway, he comes across a mirror, with another note saying \"No, not the innocent, The enemy!\". Reading this, David sees a twisted version of himself forming in the mirror. The apparition comes out of the mirror. David raises his weapon...  The Addiction is at first invincible because hurting him is hurting yourself. He chases you to the final arena, there you will get the spear, the only weapon capable of damaging him. His main attacks consists of striking David with an axe he pulls out of his body, launching electric bolts periodically and setting himself on fire. His \"death\" triggers the Ending #4 (considered the \"Good\" Ending by fans).Cry of Fear  The Addiction is featured on the poster of a fictional movie called \"Intimidated by Abnormalities\", featuring Enrique Iglesias and Daniel Leatherhoff. \"Intimidated by Abnormalities\" is obviously a play on words, meaning \"Afraid of Monsters\"Faceless  The Faceless (canon name) is a monster seen in Cry of Fear. They are first encountered in the College, attacking Simon in great numbers once he has obtained the fuse powering the building's electrical grid. Faceless are distinct for always attacking in large numbers and attempting to swarm Simon, but their durability is barely even that of a Twitcher. For an experienced player who's quick enough to avoid being surrounded and has ammunition in their gun, Faceless are hardly a threat. They're glass cannons on higher difficulties, however, unable to absorb much damage but able to dish out huge amounts of it thanks to a whopping 25 damage per hit and an extremely fast attack speed. Their main advantage against the player is early on in the College, in that they have a greater number, and darkness limiting your options for fighting them. Depending on your preferences, dual wielding the phone and either the VP70 or Glock pistol, while aiming for body shots, are the two best ways to deal with them. They go down in four shots from the glock, or about one to two bursts from the VP70, on hard mode. Remember that you cannot reload with one hand, however, and make for a safe spot when you run low on bullets. Dropping your uneeded weapons outside the college is recommended, to save inventory space for the keys you'll need to fiddle with inside the darkened school building, reducing the amount of backtracking and run-ins with them you'll need to face.  A special variant of Faceless appears in the final boss fight of Endings 1, 2, and 3. When the player is confronting Wheelchair Simon, Faceless variants called 'Twisters' will be lowered to the arena by platforms in gradually greater numbers. Twisters have metallic hooks for heads, except for one in particular called the 'Twisterv' in the model files, due to its head being a valve. When killed, the valve will fall from the Twister's body and is then used to begin opening the gate to reach Simon. Another varient of Faceless, which can only be encountered on the second visit to the Apartments--down the ladder inside the Bloody Apartment Room, lies on the floor lifelessly to fool Simon into thinking it is dead--but will attack if he gets close. Firearms are advised to deal with them; particularly the shotgun, which can finish them off in one or two shots (as it gets phased out by the better TMP, VP70, and Hunting Rifle, in the player's dwindling inventory). Attacking with melee against this variant of Faceless is a waste, as they attack quickly and move very fast, the fastest attack speed in Cry of Fear, despite their deceptively prone position. Lastly, there is a \"ghostly\" faceless, which rushes at you after falling through the walkway inside the hallucinatory sequence inside the Bloody Apartment Room's 'basement', after encountering the facehead a second time. They are, ironically, 'faced' faceless, which appear on a glance to have no body, inside the darkened hall you encounter them in. Functionally the same as other Faceless, they can be easily outrun--existing almost purely for scares, after a false encounter with the Sawrunner.Relevance to Simon  -Their relevance to Simon is not entirely clear, but they could represent his inner demons which are slowly overwhelming him. -Considering the fact that the model is of a female character, they could represent the fact that Simon feels he hurt Sophie; he can \"see it in her eyes\", he can see the damage he's done to her, and he feels ashamed to look her in the face. -The violently bloody model could represent the fact that Real life Simon brutally murders Sophie before ending his own life in endings 1 and 2.The Human Flower  The Human Flower\u00a0is a creature encountered in the Cry of Fear official single player campaign, and doctor mode. It is a writhing mass of flesh with multiple faces emerging from it, alongside one giant hand it uses to strike at the player. This monster is not exactly an enemy, but a large obstacle placed in the path of the player. It is invulnerable to regular means of damage and thus the player must find a way to either bypass it, or find alternative means of killing it. Only two Human Flowers are encountered in the game, the first having emerged from a street in the city to block the players path. The player must take an alternate route around the creature, as getting too close will cause it to impale Simon on its arm and kill him instantly, dragging his corpse into its pit; likely to be absorbed into its mass. This same creature is also seen in doctor mode and must be avoided in the same fashion. The second Human Flower is met in the subway at Saxon Avenue, having emerged from the ceiling of the tunnel the player must progress down. In order to continue on, Simon must activate the nearby train which will then run into the creature, killing it and allowing him to pass. Developer commentary states that the creature was created to trick the player into thinking that a biological outbreak of some kind was the cause of the monsters, the Human Flower meant to be shown expanding across the city and 'assimilating' slowers-- some versions of the slower even having tendrils growing throughout their body.Launcher Ghost  The Launcher Ghost is a flying enemy found in Afraid of Monsters. This monster is featureless except for its glowing face, which will glare at you menacingly from the dark. When it identifies the player, it will occasionally make a garbled sound of static. It attacks by charging up an energy attack, then releasing several \"soul\" projectiles at the player that deals a moderate amount of damage per projectile. It's recommended to dispatch this monster at a distance or behind cover as to avoid getting hit by its projectiles. Launcher Ghosts's are easily spotted in the City and Countryside levels.Trivia  It is a retextured Alien Controller from Half-Life, and functions similarly so.Protagonists David Leatherhoff  David Leatherhoff is the painkiller-addicted main character of Afraid of Monsters and Afraid of Monsters: Director's Cut. After receiving bottle after bottle of painkillers from an unknown company, he finally decided to seek help at the local hospital. After wandering into the hospital bathroom, David finds yet another bottle of pills before him. Unable to control himself, he takes the pills. Soon after, David passes out and delves into his nightmares, yet this time, he notices that they are much, much worse. Some time later, David awakens to a now abandoned hospital, everyone having gone home after a day of work. David soon discovers that his nightmares aren't in his head anymore, as they were now real. David then fights to survive against the evil hordes of his imagination.The Outcome - SPOILERS  Depending on paths and choices taken in the game, the player can have a total of four endings (Director's Cut Only). Ending 1 - David wakes up in a house, surrounded by corpses. The monsters that he had been killing to survive were in fact innocent people. His twisted imagination had gotten the better of him. With police outside, he is soon arrested. Ending 2 - David is shown being questioned by a police officer. He reveals he does not remember what happened during his drug-induced haze. Ending 3 - A guard studying a newspaper that reads: \"Psychotic Killer Claims Over 27 Victims.\" David is shown in his cell, dead, having hanged himself. Ending 4 - After fighting his worst nightmare, drug addiction, David is shown lying on a hospital bed. Doctors fight to keep him alive, but he soon flatlines. A couple seconds later, David's pulse returns; he has barely survived a drug overdose. After retracing down the hospital, the camera blacks out. It says: \"The End... or is it? Of course it's the end, you tool.\"Simon Henriksson  Simon is the main character of Team Psykskallar's Half-Life modification, Cry of Fear. At the game's start, little is known about Simon -- only that he is very lonely. One lonely night, Simon notices an old man crawling along the sidewalk wheezing for help. Upon noticing him, Simon helps the old man. Meanwhile, a nearby car revs its engines and hits Simon. Simon then falls into some sort of nightmare (similar to David's nightmare). When he awakes, he finds himself in an alley only armed with a knife (also similar to David) and his cellphone.Trivia Children (Monster)  The Children are monsters that appear in Cry of Fear. In terms of appearance, they look like the bloated, rotting corpses of small children wielding a knife in each hand. Instead of clothes, they wear a garment made of garbage bags and duct tape. This monster is first encountered in the apartment complex in a room filled with garbage bags. These bags are most likely filled with the corpses of children. The Children are very similar to the\u00a0Twitcher in terms of combat in that they are fast moving melee enemies. They attack by running towards Simon and then hitting him with a two hit combo from their knives once they get within attacking range. They are a significantly smaller target than the twitcher and their means of attack as well as the considerably quicker rate at which they attack makes it dangerous if not outright deadly when cornered by one. If you have plenty of ammo, it is recommended that you take one out at range. If you have to resort to melee weapon, the best way to deal with them is to try to keep them in the most open area readily available, moving in for a quick hit or two, then quick dodging away before they can counter attack.Locations Nightmares  Sometimes David has a terrible time through the painkiller. While suffering with the addiction he has bizarre hallucinations and nightmares. These levels consists of \"his mind\", as it is not unusual to think of strange things. The first few levels take place after he passes out in the bathroom and then returns to the twitcher-infested hospital. Sometimes David's mind slips from the realistic settings within his mind, and finds himself in a twisted world not his own. He will spot twitchers, visions, cages, and a hellish embodiment of a real terrible sight.Markland Hospital  \ufeffMarkland Hospital is the first area revealed in Afraid of Monsters. When first visited the setting is generally peaceful and unthreatening, even bright from sun shining in through the windows. After David Leatherhoff awakens from passing out on the floor of a bathroom, he realizes that the hospital is now abandoned with only a few lights left on. Strange creatures, some human, others not, roam the hospital, all of them sharing the same goal. Killing David. In the Director's Cut Version however, once David shuts off the generator to the hospital, the main enemies, Twitchers, spill out from the darkness. Markland Hospital is only visited once after escaping, in the sequence, 4mother, in which David moves on to combat his addiction. In this sequence the hospital has become an abstract maze, with upside down rooms and hallways that are angled at certain degrees or even spin uncontrollably. Common enemies in this area are, of course, the Twitchers. The only other enemies that appear are Spitters which appear rarely, and a good supply of Handcrabs in the original version.City  The city is visited after leaving the hospital. It's a regular city, but with almost no inhabitants. The city has a few apartments, and leads the player to the sewers and the alley levels. This location has quite a few common enemies, such as abominations, Launcher Ghost, and Twitchers . The city has few intimidating areas, such as an area where a zombie hangs dead (following a specific path) in a water well, with a text message displaying \"Don't let the Devil torture the God. Kill the Devil, and let the God show you the way\". Depending on the ending the player is headed towards, this can be scribbled out in blood and the words \"Kill Me\" can be written on it. The rest of the level is generally dark, with some areas that are impossible to navigate without lights. It also contains a complex sewer system readily accessible throughout parts of the map. Other places include apartments, abandoned establishments, elevators, public telephones and a metro area.Countryside  The Forest is considered to be the darkest level of all. Heavy use of the flash light is necessary to get by the monsters that appear to pop up from absolutely nowhere. A few parts of the Forest consist of going to wood shacks in the middle of nowhere. This location has quite a few monsters, and it's not rare to find all kinds of monsters in this level, especially Twitchers and Bleeding Specters.Heaven  Heaven is the last area of the game, it is identified by it's lumber walls that bleed and a present sound of a heartbeat. The player can take two different paths. One path will take him to a nightmare sequence reminiscent of the beginning of the game where he can continue using a numerical password, while another path will take the player to a maze like structure where he will fight Twitchers, Handcrabs and Launcher Ghosts.Trivia Stranger  The Stranger is an enemy encountered in Cry of Fear. A lethal enemy that is rare to find, Strangers are slow but very dangerous. They are able to be located by listening to their distinct breathing, appearing as men in suits with an opened book for a head - obviously meant to represent Simon's book and his distrust of strangers. When approached, a Stranger will begin to assault Simon telepathically, the player rapidly suffering damage until the Stranger has been killed. Once killed the creature will let out an inhuman groan and begin to twitch rapidly and flicker before simply vanishing. It would be smart to try and avoid a stranger when possible. With the cost to both health and ammunition proving taxing if the player decides to kill the stranger. In the case where the player chooses to kill the stranger it is highly advised to wield a powerful weapon such as the hunting rifle or the AR-15/M16 through the fight as the stranger is not a foe to take on in a fight of attrition. As well as this it would also be smart not to take on a stranger unless you have around one half of your health remaining as any less could result in the player dying from the stranger's telepathic assault before the player can deal a deadly blow. The Stranger's hand model was re-used for the second serious nightmare, where Simon ventures through a bloody corridor and proceeds to a room with a grate floor, which then hands pop out from the floor, attacking Simon at the same attack speed as the Stranger. Also by having a book for his head could be a showcase of the power of Simon's Book. ( weapon )Trivia Sawcrazy  Sawcrazy, as it's known by its canon model name, is a deranged psycho encountered in Cry of Fear. This monster was added in version 1.3 of the game, alongside the release of Suicide Mode. It is an enemy that will appear every few minutes in Suicide Mode and is one of the most dangerous non-boss enemies in the game, constantly swinging both its chainsaws around regardless of what is nearby, killing Players and enemies alike. The creature is extremely fast and very durable, with an above average amount of health. If it manages to catch the player, it can kill them in one hit. Bear in mind that while this makes it a priority to avoid, it can be utilized to kill other monsters in Suicide Mode due to its keen lack of discretion towards what it kills with its chainsaws. The monster previously made a single appearance in the official single player campaign following the 1.3 patch, appearing on the narrow pathway between the TL Trading building and the door towards the apartments where Sophie is encountered. However, it was removed following the 1.35 patch and taken out of the single player campaign entirely. It also makes five appearances in the official co-op campaign. Its first appearance is in Kirkville at the beginning of the game, appearing on the second portion of the map upon exiting the parking garage. The second encounter is at the beginning of the forest segment in an abandoned shack, inside a room stocked with weapons. The third location is in the asylum on the second floor, close to the doorway the players must go through to progress out a nearby window. The fourth encounter is in the lower levels of the subway upon reaching the city where it is fought alongside several suiciders. The fifth and final fight is in the cramped hallways of the TL Trading lower floor. One can also meet this monster in the Manhunt campaign. The monster's lack of discrimination is not related to Simon in any way.Crazyrunner  The Crazyrunner (canon model name) is a variant of the Crazywoman encountered earlier in Cry of Fear. This monster is first encountered in the forest segment of the game, becoming the most common enemy faced until reaching the asylum. The monster is completely silent until spotting the player, the creature suddenly breaking into a rapid fit of panicked breathing as it pursues Simon with a knife. It is not a difficult foe to kill however, merely taking two strikes with a branch to kill on the lowest difficulty. It can deal a good toll of damage, however, attacking with very fast strikes directly after the player attacks.Trivia ", "Terra Monsters World Galaxy Wiki": "Terra Monsters World Galaxy Wiki ", "War of the Monsters Fanon Wiki": "War of the Monsters Fanon Wiki ", "\u041c\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0434\u0438\u044f": "\u041c\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0434\u0438\u044f ", "Dream World Wiki": "Dream World Wiki Dream World Wiki  \u00a0  Welcome to the Dream World Wiki!

When encountered, the player can choose to give her coins or to scare her. You may also explore thus avoiding losing money or any other outcome. When the option Scare is chosen, the Beggar will run off, possibly leaving coins behind for the player. There is also a chance that the Beggar will play a trick on you and steal some of your coins. If the player chooses to give her money, she will either give him nothing, energy, or an item. The reward for giving her coins is based on the store price of health potions at a player's current level. To receive energy, a player must throw in an amount of coins equal to at least 1000 more than half the price of a health potion but no more than the price of a health potion. To receive an item, a player must throwup in an amount of coins equal to at least one more than four times the price of a health potion in the store. Note: the item will always be 7 lvls below you, and the item caps at a lvl 66 item. A list of the exact coin amounts required for rewards from the Beggar can be found here. An updated list with included event amounts can be found here .Rings  Rings are items you can get from side quests in the game.

You use up energy for the following actions: You get energy by Every player starts with a base maximum of 24 energy. You cannot regenerate to more than your max, though getting a lucky 4 energy when you're almost full may bring the total above it. You can increase your maximum energy byHealth  Your current maximum hit points are computed as the product of (your level) * (your constitution) * 2. For example, a level 3 ranger with 10 constitution would have 3*10*2 = 60 HP. He would gain 6HP by raising his constitution by one, or 20 HP by levelling up. You can regain your HP in a battle by After a battle, the Guardian heals you; this is free at low levels and when fighting her, but otherwise she charges based on the number of HP restored & your level. When you equip an item with a life bonus, you may want to visit the Surgeon and buy Stitches to bring your health fully up to the new maximum before you go into battle.Skill Points  Skill points are used to trigger skills when in battle. You can restore spent skill points by You can raise your skill point cap (maximum) by The amount of Skill Points gained from spending Learning Points in Magic is based on your current Intellect. The formula used is Int/3 + 1, and the game temporarily rounds up but keeps track of any fractions. Example 1: With 24 Int, increasing Magic by 1 would be worth 24/3 + 1 = 9 Skill Points each time. Example 2: At the normal Int cap of 32, spending points in Magic would yield 32/3 + 1 = 11.67 Skill Points. Investing in Magic multiple times would thus yield 12, 12, 11, 12, 12, 11, 12, etc Skill Points as the fractions are added up.Attributes Skills NPCs & Events Elite mobs  Some opponents have their names highlighted in red or purple. Higher level special and elite mobs can block normal attacks, use skills when that happens.Magic Mushrooms  The mushrooms can have various effects on you: a) Gives you 4 Energy Points. Last update increased it from 3 to 4 points. b) Nothing happens c) You lose Energy (this should be less than 1% chance) d) Max Skill point (just in the begining [1-5 lvl]) (see screenshot) e) +1 constitution (just in the begining [1-5 lvl]) (see screenshot) You should always eat the mushrooms when you encounter them.The Guardian Of Dreams  \"Hold! I am the Guardian of Dreams. I have an item that may assist you in your travels. However, you must prove your worthiness first by defeating me. I will not go easy on you.\" The Guardian of Dreams is a Super Elite mob and always one level above you. She is the one that always heals you after a battle for money automatically. You will also find her from time to time (probably 1-4 times in a level) and you will have to fight a hard match every time; when you win she gives you a weapon or armor of very high value and which is generally the highest for your level, but not always. She will also heal you for free after this battle.Girl in red and the Imp  The Girl in Red is an elite (red) mob, and always one level above you. The Girl in Red gives you a quest. She will either ask you to kill a certain amount of a type of mob, or even the gambler or wiseman. The Imp will give you a quest to either kill the Girl in Red, or a player in the arena. If you attack the Girl in Red she will start to dislike you and stops giving you quests. If you attack her more than 4 times, she attacks you automatically, so you have to decide which quests you'd rather do. However, it is possible to get back to where she will give you quests by running from her every time you encounter her and attacking the Imp repeatedly. The best way to face the situation: 1) Always accept Girl-in-red's quests; she will ask you to kill a number of certain monsters, the Wise Man, the Gambler, or the Imp. You won't lose anything for killing the NPC's so don't worry about it. Some people will tell you that the Wise Man trivia reward is better than the reward for defeating him, but not when you are sent by the Girl in Red, since you get good exp and coins for the victory and in addition you get exp, coins and sometimes an item from the Girl in Red as a reward. 2) Always accept the Imp's quests; and if you see that he is asking to kill the Girl in Red, give up the quest; you wont lose anything and the Imp will still pop up for another job; this because the Imp could ask you to kill another player in arena and this is easy and worth it; so watch the quest and then decide. About the player that the Imp asks you to kill: it seems real but is just a copy; name and statistics are taken randomly from a real player that wont really be attacked. So you won't have to deal with retaliation since you're fighting a sort of Player-bot. The Girl in Red is always one level higher than you, drops 3*GCD coins (or 75% of the current cost of a Health Potion), and on top of that the imp rewards you for killing her with 10*GCD coins (or an item that may be worth even more) and twice the amount of experience you got from killing her.Dust Merchant  The Dust Merchant is an Elite (purple) mob, and always one level above you. The Dust Merchant offers you fairy dust for half of the gold you are holding. This can be a good deal because fairy dust, when bought with coins, has a cost that depends on your level and on your stats. Considering the cost of the dust at the healer you can get a fair trade with the dust merchant by using the bank. Just store your money often so you won't ever spend a lot with the Dust Merchant, since she will ask you for the half of the money you are carrying. It doesn't matter if you are going around with 20 coins, she will ask you for 10. You need to keep in mind that the dust you get has about a 50% chance of being wood dust, which does nothing and isn't even an inventory item, instead of the desired fairy dust.Beggar  The Beggar will give you energy or an item depending on the amount of coins given. You will receive from the beggar either an item, 4 energy, or nothing. You can also choose to scare the beggar; but this is not recommended since the beggar will run away and give you some money (not a lot) or she might steal some of your money. The official way to get what you want from the beggar has been exposed: you need to give the beggar one coin more than the cost of 2 health potions (2 * POT +1) to get an item, which will be worth more than the minimum amount paid to get the item. For 4 energy, you give her one coin more than half the price of a health potion (POT/2 +1).The Gambler  The gambler drops 4*GCD coins if defeated in fight, and gives Exp for a normal mob one level higher than you. Skills: golden snake-eyes, hidden dice Mathematical discussion Now, losing is -1 , winning is +1, and winning a triple is +2. (A 0 would be getting my stake back.) The \"normal\" outcomes sum to zero; the gambler has more than you just as often as you have more than the gambler; the triples don't affect this since 2-2-2 has the same chance to lose as 5-5-5 has to win, etc., and they tie equally often. Result: I lose, on average, 3.58% of my stake, if the dice are fair. (The game might be affected by dexterity or some other stat.) Overall, it is a much better idea just to kill the Gambler since you might just lose your money and you get EXP from killing him (not a difficult task)Wishing Well  Like the Beggar, the well may reward you for giving money. Possible outcomes are: Please add additional values/ranges to the table as you discover them. To insert a row simply right click then go to \"Row\" then \"Insert Row\" The results are random - Outcomes 2 & 3 are equally likely when donation is between 1/2 & full cost of Health Potion, Outcomes 2,3 & 4 when donating more. Alternatively, you can just dive in. This can result in money, energy loss, or nothing.The Wiseman  \"Hello character class, Would you like to have a chat with a bored, old man?\" If you Accept his invitation and have a high enough (unsure how much exactly) Intelligence, he says: The reward is somewhat less than answering the trivia question correctly, but not by much (approx. 15% less?). With lower Intelligence the reward is very small because you aren't able to understand what he's saying. The Trivia reward is 4*GCD coins (the price of a health potion) and twice the Exp you would have received fighting an opponent one level above you. Click to see the Another possible place where they get questions is THIS (Found By Angel6Of6Death6)A Puzzle Box  The rewards of the puzzle box are 4*GCD coins and the same XP as if you had won against an opponent one level higher than you.Type A  http://img189.imageshack.us/img189/5991/aaaaan.png To solve the color puzzle boxes go to http://dream-world.50webs.com/mastermind.html if dream-world.50webs.com/mastermind is down, try http://kongregatedreamworld.webs.com/ which is just a duplicate of dream-world.50webs.com/mastermind, all rights reserved. Or you can use this alternative puzzle solver http://helios.wh2.tu-dresden.de/~jooschi/colorbox/ (By Arcangelo) The non color puzzle boxes are based on mine sweeper. Every tile has a number and that number indicates how many correct tiles are adjacent to it. This might help if your having trouble visualizing the thought process.Type B  http://img246.imageshack.us/img246/4826/aaaaoi.png http://img515.imageshack.us/img515/5811/aaaaqs.png It's hard to describe a general strategy for these, even though I personally almost always win. But let's try to enumerate some easy tips, just in case it's not obvious to anyone: 1) If you see a \"3\" in the middle of a side, then that tells you that the three adjacent buttons are correct, so click them. 2) If you see a \"2\" in a corner, then that tells you that the two adjacent buttons are correct, so click them. Strategy for (usually) winning: You can divide the grid into two groups: The \"X\" group (center and corners), and the \"O\" group (edges). The number on the middle tells you how many correct buttons are in the O group. The X group, therefore, has whatever is left. Since each group is separate from the others, you can solve each as its own puzzle as follows: \"O\" group: If there are 0 or 4 here, then none or all of them need to be marked (obviously). If there are 3 here, then two of the corners will be 1s, and two will be 2s. All three spaces adjacent to a corner 2 are the ones you want. If there is 1 here, then the space between the two corner 1s is correct (the other two corners will have 0s. If there are 2 here, then there are two possibilities. Either you will have corner values of 2-1-1-0 or 1-1-1-1. In the case of 2-1-1-0, the two spaces adjacent to the 2 are correct. In the case of 1-1-1-1, then two opposite spots are correct (top / bottom or left / right) There is no way to tell which is correct, so you will need to guess. This may cause you to make the one error you are allowed. \"X\" group: Again, 0 is obvious - none of them. If there is 1, then the edges will be either 1-1-0-0 or 1-1-1-1. In the first case, the corner between the 1s is correct. In the second case, the center is correct. If there are 2, then the edges will be either 1-2-1-0, 2-2-1-1, or 1-1-1-1. In the first case, the two corners adjacent to the 2 are correct. In the second case, the center and the corner between the 2s are correct. In the last case, two opposite corners are correct (upper-left / lower-right or upper-right / lower-left). Unfortunately, you cannot tell which way it works, and so you may use your one allowed error here. If there are 3, then there are 3 possibilities. If any edge is a 3, then the three spaces adjacent to it are correct. If the edges are 1-1-2-2, then the three corners adjacent to the 2s are correct. If the edges are 2-2-2-2, then you need the center and two opposite corners. Unfortunately, there is no way to tell which pair of corners, so you may make your allowed mistake here. However, since this means that the \"O\" group only has 1, you can still always complete the puzzle without risking a second error. If there are 4, then the edges are either 2-2-2-2 or 3-3-2-2. In the first case, the solution is the four corners. In the second case, all spaces adjacent to one (or both) of the 3s is correct. Using these patterns, you can always solve this puzzle, unless the numbers are all 1s, except for the center being a 2. In this case, you have to make two guesses, and so 25% of the time you will fail. I have never seen this pattern appear, however, so it may be coded to not happen. I have seen both of the \"take a guess\" patterns happen individually, but never both at the same time. There is an even simpler method to do this tough. Just go to this [calculator ]and follow the instructions presented there. 100% accuracy with only a few seconds wasted.Treasure Chest  The treasure chest reward is 4*GCD (the cost of a health potion) plus the experience you'd get from fighting a mob one level above you. Treasure chest require a 2 digit answer (10-99) to open. They can be bashed open but there is a chance that something bad will happen if you attempt this. All of the problems can be solved with a calculator, given the knowledge of how to solve the problem. To locate your calculator on most PC's click the start menu button on your desktop, the far bottom left side, then click all programs, then click Accessories, then click Calculator. Or use Google, it doubles as a calculator. The three possible question types are as follows:Liquid Containers  Example: Treasure Chest: \"I have 553 gallons of milk. How many 27 gallon containers can I fully fill?\" Note that it specifies fully filled. To solve, simply divide the quantity of liquid by the number of containers and round down, as the fraction is leftover liquid that is not enough to fill another container: 553 divided by 27 = 20.48, so the answer for this example is 20.Age Arithmetic  Example: Treasure Chest: \"My age will be 69 in 30 years. How young am I now?\" This type of riddle requires basic arithmetic to solve.Heads and Legs  This Treasure Chests will give you a question that requires solving a two-variable equations. For example: On a farm with chickens and three-legged cows: On a farm with chickens and horses: On a farm with three-legged cows and horses: If you want an excel file that will do the same job you can download it from here (by NeuroSurgeon). The file contains all the 3 possible situations; you have to input the number of heads and legs, and then read at the right line the results. One can also use the website WolframAlpha. For the above riddle enter \"3x + 2y = 138 AND x + y = 49\" (without the citationmarks) to get the answer to the riddle where the answer for x will be the number of three-legged-cows. Change the numbers in the formula according to your riddle of course. Finally, you can also calculate the result by head. In the example, if all 49 animals were chickens, there would be a total of 49\u00b72=98 legs. However, there are 138 legs, which is an excess of 40. That means there are 40 three-legged cows, which is the correct answer. That is, first you multiply the number of heads by the number of feet that corresponds to the other kind of animal. If there are three-legged cows in the farm, the difference between that number and the number of feet given in the problem is the correct answer. Otherwise, the correct answer is half the difference. Dream World/Allies Dream World/LocationsGuilds  To create a guild or raise its level costs coins. Players in a guild partake of bonuses to the players, depending on the guild's level. They can use the guild wall to communicate and the guild vault can be used to exchange items among guild members. The fame of a guild is the total sum of the levels of its members. A guild can have a maximum of 30 members until Gaurdian Guild level is achieved. EDIT\u00a0:: Guilds cost 10 million to start, but are free to join, and allow up to 9 invites. Bonuses are gained per player added, and there is no item sharing, guild wall, or vault of any kind.Side Quests  There are many side quests you may pursue throughout the game. Completing side quests gives you additional items, gold, and what not.Arena  Here's what you need to beat anyone in the arena (I only have 25 constitution, and I'm beating everyone I face) - Ranger class line is my recommendation, as it has the most crits, but you can use this guide as any class. Use Shield at the beginning of the match, then Aim. This will halve your damage taken, increase your crit chance, reduce miss chance and reduce enemy block chance. Use skills to do damage. Easier skills do more damage/skill point, but higher skills do more damage/round. I usually use either the 6 or 9 point gun skill. If you start to get low health, use Lesser Heal. Refill skill points with fairy dust as needed.Demon Gates Unlocked by offering:  666 666 666 coin or 6 gems or Gate Key found in a treasure box Guilds can attack the same demons and boss if someone within the guild unlocks a gate.Rewards:  up to 6 player can win a rare item, the rest will recieve coins based on their damage outputFire Gate (Orb)  Defeat: 99 demons Boss:Ubepyromuth Lvl:60 Hp:11 000 000Ice Gate  Defeat: 99 demons Boss:Lysiana Lvl: 60 Hp: 11 000 000Thunder Gate  Defeat: 99 demons Boss:Thunderas Lvl:60 Hp:11 000 000Helpful links A Puzzle Box  The Puzzle Box is a random event encountered during exploration. If the player chooses to open it, they'll have to solve a puzzle in order to earn coins and experience. There are 2 types of puzzle boxes:Rewards Side Quests  Side Quests are quests received from characters in town which are not required to advance in game. Except for The Last Letter, they can all be repeated for additional rewards of coins or items and experience. Note that level-scaled experience is always given as a quest reward. Side quests do not have actual level requirements, but their availability depends on being able to access new areas, which in turn has a level requirement, reflected in the table below.Side Quests  ~ Available only on Facebook.A Wishing Well Description  The Wishing Well is an event encountered while exploring. The player has the option to either throw coins in or dive in. Diving in results in the player being rewarded with coins or, on rare occasion, losing energy instead. Throwing in coins can result in nothing, a gain of energy, a gain of double the coins that were thrown in (eg: throw in 1000 and receive it 2000 back total), a magic item or a refill of skill points. The reward for throwing coins is based on the store price of health potions at a player's current level. To be eligible for the coin or energy reward, a player must throw in an amount of coins equal to at least 1 more than half the price of a health potion. To be eligible for skill points, a player must throw in an amount of coins equal to at least one more than four times than the price of a health potion in the store. A list of the exact coin amounts required for the wishing well can be found here. An updated copy of the spreadsheet including event coin amounts can be found here. Fun Facts:The Wiseman  The Wiseman is an NPC randomly encountered during exploration. When encountered, the player can choose to fight him, talk to him, or attempt to answer a trivia question. He is loosely based on Gandalf from The Lord of the Rings.Options Fight  When the option fight is chosen, the Wiseman will be attackable. He is one level above the player's level.Talk  If the player chooses (by clicking accept) to talk to him, the player will get experience and coins. Reactions (found from all social networks): Which reaction you get depends on your intelligence stat. The more intelligence, usually the better the Reaction will be for you.Trivia  By choosing the option Trivia you'll get a random question that you can answer. Answering it correctly yields you experience and coins. The answers to many of the trivia questions can be found at http://pkl.net/~matt/moxfull.db, though searching on Google (or other search engines) is the method used by most players. When the \"hint\" letters are in lower case, Wikipedia is considered the authority -- even if Wikipedia is wrong. When the \"catagory\" is called \"utterly stupid trivia\" it's usually a riddle and can't be found in search engines. It's time to have an eight year old child handy, or kill off the Wiseman to teach him some wisdom again.Skills Quotes  \"You dare to challenge me?\"Possible answers  For additional question and answers, see SigmundFreud's The Wiseman.Gameplay Skills, Classes, and Training  There are three types of weapon skills in Dream World. Characters learn these skills through training. You might unlock skills if your meet the intelligence attribute requirement. You can also unlock new professions as well by raising weapon skills. Skills Most of skills are either offensive skills that will do extra damage or recovery skills that will heal your character. The damage for sword and gun offensive skill will be based on the level of the skill and your attack rating. Just like normal sword and gun attacks, your average damage range will be higher if your skill level is closer to your character level. The damage and heal amount of magic skill is based on the level of the skill, your character's level, and your intelligence and dexterity attributes. What skills you have available in combat depend on your equipped weapon. You may change weapons in the middle of combat to change which skills you can use. Descriptions of skills are shown as Skill Name: (Skill point cost to use, IQ to learn) Damage values will vary depending on the character's skills, weapon, opponent's armor, etc.Special Skills  Each skill type has a special skill. There is a \"guard\" sword skill, which increase chances of blocking. The \"aim\" gun skill increases accuracy and critical hit rate and decreases your opponent's block rate. The \"shield\" magic skill will reduce the amount of damage you receive in combat. These special skills are useful for long combat fights, such as arena fights, although bosses above level 50 will always counter.Classes  Dream World begins by allowing its player to choose from three available classes - the knight, the ranger, or the mage. You can view and change your class by clicking on the \"classes\" tab in the \"character\" menu. Each class will have a set of bonuses associated with them. The higher the requirement to unlock a class, the greater the benefit. 4 New ultimate classes (available to level 75+ players with required skill levels).\n** Divine Blade - requires level 90 sword skill\n** Mega Bang - requires level 90 gun skill\n** Divine Sage - requires level 90 magic skill\n** Dragonlord - requires level 80 in all combat skillsSee Also Reference Girl in Red Description  The Girl in Red is a NPC randomly encountered during exploration; a grown-up version of the classic Little Red Riding Hood. When encountered, the player can choose to fight her or the talk to her. She is one level above the player's level. If the player chooses (by clicking accept) to talk to her, she will give the player a quest to kill a certain amount of monsters, or another NPC encountered while exploring (namely, either The Gambler or The Wiseman). The reward is either money or a weapon or armor. Unlike the other NPCs, the Girl in Red takes offense at being attacked. At first she scowls when she sees you, and does not give you a quest. If attacked enough times, the Girl in Red will attack you immediately when she sees you. This can be reversed by repeatedly running from fights with the Girl in Red and repeatedly attacking the Little Imp (who sometimes gives the player a quest to defeat her). Note: By running away from her it means to choose the TOWN MAP Menu, NOT engaging in a fight and then choosing to run.Skills Quotes  \"You attack a defenseless girl?\" \"You will regret this!\" \"It's payback time!\"Demon Gates  Demon Gates are the first expansion area, and become accessible at level 51 after completing the basic game. They consist of three separate gates, which need to be opened before they can be accessed. They are preceded by Mount Killjoy and followed by the second expansion area, Alien Portal.Areas  Each of these areas requires a special key to enter, or a sacrifice of 666,666,666 coins or 6 gems. More powerful gates may be opened with demon orbs. Keys can be found from treasure chests or mystery boxes, and orbs can be obtained from a rare drop by normal demons within the gates, or from mystery boxes. Both keys and orbs are specific to a gate. Only one gate may be open at any time. Each gate has 20 normal demons, 99 if in guild, and a boss. Each boss has an attack that hits very hard, but should be survivable with a level close to the boss and high constitution. Regeneration armour is recommended.Rewards  Once a gate is opened, all members in the same guild may participate in killing the demons and the boss. Damage on the boss is cumulative from all members. After the boss is defeated, the participants receive rewards. The player who opened the gate and the five players who did most damage against the boss each get an item, and others beyond the first five receive coins relative to damage. Everyone also receives experience for damage caused to the boss. The item rewards are either demon weapons or armor. From a normal gate, the rewards are lesser demon items of up to level 60, and from an orb gate greater demon items of up to level 64, matching the levels of the bosses. The Demon Wings Premium ally will be awarded for the first orb gate opened by a player when the boss is defeated.Equipment Side Quests  Side quests you can take from shop sellersPhoenix (ally)  The Phoenix is an Ally that you might encounter in the Phoenix Territories (and possibly in other areas). You have the ability to name it freely at your choice.

This is the first game in the series to qualify as a tactical RPG.Game Plot  Telepath RPG Chapter 2 follows directly from the story of the first chapter. You awaken in an empty bedroom in the top floor of a strange black building. Walking out onto the balcony, you realize that you are in some kind of city built in a vast underground cavern. You soon learn that you have been enslaved by shadowlings, and are forced to carry out a series of missions on their behalf in their civil war with the spriggats. Along the way, you run into old friends and learn more about the conflict, ultimately choosing what role you will play in determining its outcome.Combat  Combat in Telepath RPG Chapter 2 is turn-based, tactical, and occurs on an 11-by-8-square grid. Before battle, the player arranges his available characters into slots, which determines their turn order once in combat. The goal of every battle is to kill all enemies on the battlefield (or, in a few fights, to kill the boss characters) while keeping your main character alive. If your main character dies, the game is over.Characters  These Characters may join the Main Character: Antagonists: Other characters of interest:Dialog and Advancement  Telepath RPG Chapter 2 employs a dialog tree system similar to the one used in Fallout, which lets the player take multiple \"paths\" through conversations, sometimes with serious in-game consequences. Unlike most RPGs, Telepath RPG Chapter 2 does not use an experience point based leveling system. Characters advance when the player pays gold to train them in particular areas such as Psy Power, Psy Defense, or specific combat skills. When they reach certain milestones in their stats, characters may get special bonuses such as new attacks or a higher level in attacks they have already learned.Orbs  There are eight orbs in the game that the player can find to boost his main character's abilities, bestow resistances, or teach new attacks. Most of them are hidden, and require perseverance to find.Walkthrough  The walkthrough can be found here.Duel  Duel mode allows one to battle a friend or oneself in one of the characteristic TRPG2 style maps. The two players must agree on the number of teammates per player (between 4-7), if the turn sequence is staggered or whole team (ie players swap turns after moving just one teammate, or after moving the whole team), and which of eight avaible battlefields they fight on. Then each player can customize their team by choosing units of 4 different classes. In some countries, there are TRPG2 tournaments.Where to Find the Game Telepath RPG: Servants of God  Telepath RPG: Servants of God is the third game in the Telepath RPG series of games. The game was released on February 14, 2012.Plot  The plot of Telepath RPG: Servants of God does not follow directly from the story of Telepath RPG 1 or Telepath RPG 2.

When the game begins, the government has just been overthrown in a coup by its own armed forces acting under the sway of a religious group known as \"The Cult\". The hero and his parents are thrown into prison. The remainder of the game centers on the hero's quest to save his parents, remove the Cult's hold on power, and restore representative democracy to Ravinale.Combat  Combat in Telepath RPG: Servants of God is turn-based, tactical, and occurs on an 11-by-8-square grid.

What is your command?\" \"My unique design trades the heavier armor of my brother units for increased mobility.\" \"The Mechanics were formed many years ago by a genius inventor named Sibelius in response to problems with bandits in the Cera Bella countryside. He has made a fortune, and the Mechanics have grown so big that they are a force to be reckonded with in their own right.\"Trivia TRPG2 Mission 6  Before attempting this mission it is advisable to train up the team more than for the previous missions put together: leveling up all flying units (useful for the first part of the mission) and, in particular, getting Grotius's hp to around 65, leveling up Niven's attacks so that his Fling deals 30-40 damage, generally leveling up all teammates to have around 45-55 hp, leveling up all teammates to deal around 15-20 damage, it is also crucial to get Shadow Resistance to all teammates that can get it (all Shadowlings, except for Niven). Training up the Hero to have Vengeance and have high hp (around 50) could come in very handy, as well as having the Green Orb(gives a boost to speed). After completing mission 5, Tastidian will send you to rescue General Darkeye, who is stranded on an island in the centre of Lake Alto. Go to Lake Alto and it might be a good idea to talk to Pirate Pete before continuing with the mission. You'll see a boat there: go to the Psy Boat and your first task will be to take it back from Spriggat control.Battle One: defend the boat  This battle can be done without too much leveling up beforehand. One way is to send your Shadowlings and attack the leftmost Spriggat formation using Shadowboxer's area attack, whilst using other Shadowlings to bring down the left-most Frost Spriggat. Next, bring up the Hero to the centre of the ship, but keep him out of the battle for now. Next, use the remaining teammates to engage in battle the two Spriggats on the right hand side of the map, it might be a good idea to draw them closer to the shore, so that more teammates can attack them and maybe enlist Niven's and Grotius' help in the process (if you leveled up Grorius enough, then he'll have Frost Shield- use it on other teammates when time allows to give them Cold Resistance, as this will lower the damage from Frost Spriggat attacks by half). Use Festus to heal, if necessary, and then concentrate on taking down the Healer, whilst making sure not to attack the other Spriggat, as it will cause the Healer to cast a Big Shield, and that will also automatically self-heal the Healer Spriggat as well. Send the Hero into battle, along with others, and the Healer shall fall in one turn (make sure you position the Shadowlings in such a way as to allow the Hero a clear shot at the Healer). Meanwhile, on the other side of the map, try to gang up on one of the Spriggats first, before taking out the other and retreat any wounded units, unless you have a second healer on your team (not counting the Hero). Finally, gang up the Shadowlings and the Hero on the last Spriggat left of the initial enemy trio and kill him (at this point, sending Festus to help out the remaining teammates on the right might be a good idea if they took a heavy beating). Finally, finish the last Spriggat on the right side of the map and the boat is yours.Battle Two: enemy patrol  Get onto the boat and set course to the left, moving along the shore. You'll end up facing a mine-field. Approach it and then keep moving north until you see a breach in the field and what looks like another shore with a docking area- take your time and move your boat there, dock and disembark. You've reached Gen. Darkeye's island! Along the way you might meet an enemy patrol, and you'll have to fight on board the boat. There are several enemy formations to tackle, all made up of Frost and Red Spriggat. A general tip is to use area attacks and gang up on one or two Spriggats from the beginning and kill them, then concentrate on the Healer, and finally split up and kill the remaining spriggats. Having all of the flying teammates available active on the rooster can greatly help manoeuvrability during these encounters.Battle Three and Battle Four: protect General Darkeye  Once on the island, proceed into the cave and you'll meet Gen. Darkeye, wounded and retreating with his army. The problem now is that the Spriggats find the cave and attack your formation, thus you'll have to defend yourself and your teammates. Take a note that three battles consequtive battles will follow, so try your best to not lose any teammates in the first two battles! The strategy for the first two battles is more or less the same: wait one or two turns for the Spriggats to come into a closer formation and closer to you (meanwhile discreetly move the Shadowlings along the right edge of the map upwards), then use your Shadowlings to attack the Spriggat formation from the right side, Dark Vortex could come in handy, as well as Niven's Fling. Next, bring up the Hero and one or two other teammates to the right of the stone and use area attacks or any single powerful attacks to deal as much damage to the formation as possible. Meanwhile, use one teammate to draw off the left-most one or two Spriggats and, at the same time, move Gen. Darkeye to the right-bottom corner of the map. If you've trained up enough, your first attack should kill one or two Spriggats and significantly weaken several others, so that even after being Healed, they won't be completely healthy. Next, depending who you have on your team and in what order, try either killing or separating the Healers from the rest of the pack (something simple as standing between them and their targets could work), and whist you're doing that, use the remaining teammates to draw off the Spriggats. Gang up and kill off one Spriggat at a time,and don't forget to keep healing any severly wounded teammates. On the left side of the map, it might be a good idea to send a teammate or two to help the lone straggler (it would be easier if that is Grotius) defeat the one/two Spriggats he/she cut off from the very beginning. Finally, after several turns, you should be left with one or two almost dead spriggats, who should not pose a problem to finish. One thing to watch out for is that Spriggats use 1-2 range attacks, so hiding a critically wounded teammate behind another will not work in this case.But Gen. Darkeye (while he's wounded)is a strong shadowling.Battle Five: protect General Darkeye from Cerzak  Finally, Cerzak himself arrives at the scene and after a short verbal communication, you'll have to defend yourself and your team from his wrath. The objective of this battle is to defeat Cerzak, along with his two Dark Spriggat minions. There are several things to watch out for: the Dark Spriggats deal 15 damage, whilst Cerzak deals a whopping 20 (that means that he'll kill Gen. Darkeye in 2 shots, Darkeye has Shadow Resistance\u00a0:-D); the Dark Breath attack has range 1-3 and a nasty side effect of decreasing speed by 1 (down to a minimum of 2 steps per turn!) of any teammate, unless they have Shadow Resistance; Cerzak recuperates about 10 health each turn. Thus, one way around this battle is to start off exactly as before, but this time round concentrate your first attack on the three Frost Spriggats, then proceed to draw out the two Dark Spriggat minions, whilst keeping away from Cerzak and keeping the Red Spriggat Healers at bay. Thus, start off as usual, with the Shadowlings attacking two Frost Spriggats and a Dark Spriggat from the right side (make sure to not place any units in direct line with Cerzak), then use the Hero's Pyro Hail to add more damage to that, whilst from the other side of the rock, let Grotius make a very big detour, and attack the left Dark Spriggat with Frost Breath 2 (this will draw off the Dark Spriggat) and use any remaining teammates to attack the left Frost Spriggat from the bottom. During the next turns, reposition your teammates such as to avoid being hit by Cerzak, and at the same time getting rid of the Frost Spriggats. Keep moving Gen. Darkeye away from the action, if Cerzak follows, place a teammate on his way, if need be. Next, Grotius should be leveled up just enough to survive and kill the left Dark Spriggat, whilst taking all teammates and ganging up on the right Dark Spriggat should bring him down fairly quickly too. Now, Darkling can occupy the Healers at the top of the map by physically blocking the way and by injuring one of them so that the other heals his comrade. Finally, disperse all teammates,if possible, so that you can heal them far away from the reaches of Cerzak. If you, however, have several units that cannot run away from Cerzak, then Festus' Big Shield should be of great use, and then it would be up to the second healer or the Hero to heal up any other wounded teammates, who are still fast enough to escape from Cerzak. Next, surround Cerzak with all units (whilst keeping Gen. Darkeye far away) available and attack with full strength. To make it easier, position units with strongest attack behind Cerzak to use backstab bonus to the max. After winning the battle by knocking out Cerzak, you'll have the option of killing him (and Grotius, as he'll stick up for his Dad) or showing mercy. Truthfully, you don't gain anything from being merciless- morale and ethics notwithstanding, you lose fighting slots (through losing personality points) and you lose a valuable teammate. After making your decision, you exit the cave and face one of the most challenging non-battle tasks in the entire mission set.Part 6: Flee the island before the enemy finds you!  In the last part, you'll have to escape the island in your boat whilst navigating your way through a newly-placed extensive minefield. You're also timed, and some paths are pretty narrow, so keeping your head cool and trying to stick to a mine \"wall\" and try to make your way out would be a good idea. For those of you having trouble with this part of the mission, here is a map of the Lake:\u00a0  When you disembark at the dock, go to Somnus to receieve your final assignment from Tastidian. Note:if your boat explodes theres a chance that the autosave will land you in somnus,therefore saving you from navigating the maze.TSoG Side Quests  There are a variety of different side quests and minigames in Telepath RPG: Servants of God.Randomly Generated Battles Bandit Raids  A man in the northwest corner of the Ravinale Marketplace named Achmed will ask you to avenge him by attacking bandits who steal from merchants like him. Every bandit raid is randomly generated, so it will never be the same battle twice. All of them are won the same way, though: kill all the bandits or stay alive for 35 turns. Attacking bandits is relatively easy, and can be done repeatedly, so this gives you some money to supplement what you win from normal battle.Bug Hunting  Go to the Deeper Downs to fight bugs, spirits, and old Bronze Golems for rewards (presumably for bounties placed on them, and for assorted parts and such). This is similar to Bandit Raiding but the battles are more difficult and the reward is higher.Ravinale Guard Patrols  When returning to Ravinale, there is random chance that the Resistance will run into a detachment of Ravinale Guard enemies. The higher Duvalier's Aptitude is, the less likely to run into the patrol.Ambushed By Loyalists!  When going to Somnus, there is random chance that the Resistance will run into a detachment of Shadowling Loyalists enemies. The higher Duvalier's Aptitude is, the less likely to run into the patrol.Lurking in the Underbrush...  When traveling through the Great Forest, there is random chance that the Resistance will run into a several enemies lurking in the underbrush. The higher Duvalier's Aptitude is, the less likely to run into the lurking creatures.Attack on the Mechanic Base!  The location of the Mechanic Base can be found by either scanning the mind of a Mechanic soldier in the Labor Site or reading from a cache of books from the third crypt.Businessman  Talk to the Businessman near the Ravinale Docks. Accept his proposal, then fight him instead of paying him.Psy Duel  Psy Duel is a game that you can play with Ali the Incorrigible. It consists of using minions to attack the enemy and gaining financial backers to hire those minions. There are two types of financial backers: one is the merchant, which can help hire \"good\" units, and the other is the smuggler, which helps to hire \"bad\" units. The \"good\" units are the assassin, psy fighter, psy healer, bowman, scorpion and guard. The \"bad\" units are the spriggat, shadowling, bug, stone golem, bronze golem, and energy golem. There are also other cards which can be used. The Cryo Blast card attacks an enemy minion for 2 damage, Pyro Blast does 5 damage to the opponent, Dark Vortex does 2 damage to all enemy minions, Feedback does 3 damage to the opponent and heals 3 health for you, and Mind Shield heals 3 health. Each player starts with 15 health, which can be raised through healing or lowered from damage. Once a player reaches zero health, the other player wins. There is a bet on the outcome of every game. The bet is directly proportional to your character's Personality stat, so characters with higher Personality will wager more gold.Crypts  Go to the Library and talk to the guard there. Ask him why that section of the library is off limits and then talk to the Librarian. Ask her where the books went. She will tell you to go away and to come back for something later. Once you return to the library, she will give you a note and you can access the first crypt. These crypts feature many puzzles and battles, and also contain great rewards.Tikki's Cave  Requires 10 Psy Power to complete. Once you start mission 2, you must talk to Griffin to see what your next move is. Then go to Marid, and talk to the woman named Umma. She will give you a quest to retrieve stones from her son's pet, Tikki. Once you talk to her you can go into the tent above her and talk to Imran. He wants you to kill Tikki. It is important to note that if you complete the mission before talking to him, he will not ask you to kill Tikki, or give you money, even if you did kill Tikki. Once you have talked to Umma, go between the tents to the northeast to get to Tikki's Cave. Click on the chest behind Tikki (This is where the 10 Psy Power is needed). Once it falls onto the ground, click on it and take the stones. However, once you do, Tikki will attack, giving you two options. You can defend yourself, which makes Tikki go first, or you can calm him down (which requires 10 aptitude). If you calm him down, you can either run, or attack him, which makes you go first. Once you return to Marid, go can give the stones to either Umma or Imran, both of which give you 50 gold, and collect an extra 200 gold if you killed Tikki for Imran.Arman's Quest  This quest has no requirements, but 11 Aptitude and Personality is suggested for the most advantageous completion. Start at Baz's Manor and approach Arman and choose the following following options: - Sure. - What's the job? - What is this, ecactly? - Okay, fine. Next you need to go to the Ravinale Docks and speak to Al'al and choose the following options: - [Read his mind.] - Al'al, I presume.

[Crack knuckles.] To increase your Speed by one: - Teach me how to move faster. - [Done.] To increase your Personality by one: - There's no need--it was my pleasure.. - [Done.] Without 11 Personality, or if you choose different options than the ones above, Al'al will refuse the money and you will be forced to kill him. The reward is 500 Gold. Also, after mission four, Arman will be killed by the Black Rose if you don\u2019t convince them. You can also, if you have 11 Personality, work for the Black Rose and get the Knife attack. Start at Baz's Manor and approach Arman and choose the following following options: - Sure. - What's the job? - What is this, exactly? - Okay, fine. Next you need to go to the Ravinale Docks and speak to Al'al and choose the following options: - Are you Al'al? - Me. Whatever you are involved in, I want in. - Well... no. - Depends. What is the pay? - No, not really. - [Continue] - [Continue] - [Continue] - [Continue] - [Continue] - [Done] Now go back to Arman. - Yeah. Sort of. - I did, but he wouldn't accept it. - What's going on here Arman? - I'm going to help you out with this Arman. - [Done] Now if you go back to Al'al, you can now go on assassination missions. Plus you get the 500 gold from Arman.Join the Black Rose  This is an incomplete quest, where you can work as an assassin for the Order of the Black Rose.Assassinate Radiques  Kill RadiquesBlack Rose HQ  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Im not sure how much apptitude is needed for this (I think 11) Start at the docks Pass by the bar and head up taking your next left into a building In the building make your way around the barrals andto the Left stairs.

I got these results in the demo.Resisting Arrest  If you give 5 Gold to the Beggar in the Marketplace, then demand that he give it back, you end up in a solo fight with three Ravinale Spearman. (There is an option to flee.) As long as the hero has 32 Health and Feedback or Vengeance (on Normal difficulty), you can win the fight by running away whenever you're low on PsP. The money earned per fight is 315 gold, making it excellent for getting training money (so long as you survive.)Dayn's Debt  Currently the Hero can talk to Dayn and with 13 aptitude get some gold out of him.Mahboob  The Hero can talk to Mahboob (located in the east building in West Ravinale) and find out about what task is required of the Hero in this sidequest. Then, go to the house west of Mahboob's house, and either talk to Rayhana near the southeast corner, or Wadi in the northeast corner. Although there are many various ways to complete this (most of which end in you getting nothing), the best way is to talk to Wadi, tell him to leave, say your employers will not be happy, your employer is Mahboob, she told you that Wadi beats his wife, and she is paying you 2000 gold. He will give you 2000 gold. Then, click on the desk right above Wadi, and open the desk drawer. Use Misdirection (high aptitude needed) and browse through all letters. Then, tell Rayhana that Wadi is having an affair. After Wadi leaves, tell Mahboob that you successfully got Wadi out. She will give you the Heat Orb. Then, you may threaten to tell her about her affair with Wadi to Rayhana (even if you've already told her), and extort 500 gold from her.Baz's Cellar  Once you defeat Azma you can go further into Baz's cellar. Floor 3: Go into the room on the right and walk up to the tapestry on the north wall and click on it. Pull on it and enter the left room. The wall blocking the doorway is now gone. Proceed to the fourth floor. Floor 4: Go south and enter the hallway. You will then reach a T-section. On the left is a chest that holds the map to the cellar. On the right is a lot of barrels. The fifth barrel on the inside-left is actually a switch. Click it and proceed to the fifth floor (By going around the barrels). Floor 5: If you pushed the barrel in the pervious room there should be no wall blocking the stairway. Proceed to the sixth floor. Floor 6: You are presented with a maze. The directions are (unless noted, go until you can't move that direction anymore): Left, Up, Left, Down, Left, Up, Right, Up, Right, Down, Right, Down, Right, Up, Right (stop a first divergence), Down, Right, Up (Stop at second divergence), Left (Stop at first divergence), Up, Left. Stop at the stairway and proceed to the seventh floor. Floor 7: If you choose to stay you will be confronted by 2 Ghosts and a Greater Ghost. You can choose to fight them, flee or bargain with them. If you have 11 aptitude or less, your bargain will fail and you will have to fight them. If you have 12 or more aptitude, your bargain will work and they will leave. Once you either convince them to leave, or destroy them, you can walk around the room. Walk north and you will find a chest that holds the Indigo Orb, which gives the Hero: Titan Shield. Battle: Basement Spooks Remember, the Greater Ghost has immunity to physical attacks. Destroy the treasure chests for extra gold.Pest Removal  This quest has no requirements, but 1000 gold is needed to recruit the \"pests.\" Once you enter Somnus go up to the intersection and go right. Go into the house on the north side of the street and talk to the shadowling, Gloomling. He will mention he has some squatters in his basement and needs you to get rid of them. Once you go down the stairs you find out that the pests, are actually two rapping Spriggats named La'Man and Naj. Choose the following options. - [Continue] - Kick it? - No, I don't know what that means. - [Continue] - [Continue] - [Continue] - That was pretty good. - [Continue] - Maybe you should pratice somehwere else. - [Continue] - Your right, that's not what I mean. - Try another city. - Ravinale. - [Continue] - I'm part of a movement to free the city. - [Continue] - You'd be welcome with us, at least. - [Continue] - Yes, come be our, ah... Minstrels. - [Continue] - Sounds good, I'll take it. - [Continue] - [Done] Once you recruit them you can go up to Gloomling and talk to him. He will give you 400 gold because of your efforts. However, if you anger La'Man and Naj they will no longer speak to you. In some cases they might even try to attack you. If they attack you and you kill them both, Glooming will be overjoyed, and give you 1000 gold instead of 400.Hidden Treasure Chests Riddle Chests  Certain chests with steam-powered combination locks are scattered around the world. To open them, you must translate glyphs from the Old Alphabet. These chests generally contain large amounts of gold, much more than regular hidden chests.Sharif and the Abolitionists  After a certain point in the game, when you speak to Baz, he may inform you that one of his friends needs a favor. Thus begins a side quest with several battles and multiple potential endings.The Helenites  Once you discover the Helenites' base, it is possible to have Helena offer you a quest as a way of helping pay for troops.Chief Uf'Uwan's Generosity  Travel to the Rubat clan, and enter the tent to the left.

Talk to him again and he will guide you to where he is being kept. After 3 battles you will have freed him and you can start another side quest (capturing Hellion) by talking to him.Crypt Walkthrough  There are a series of mini quests taking place in Crypts in Telepath RPG: Servants of God.Crypt 1 East Ravinale  Has no minimal requirement for most advantageous completion. Go into the library and walk through the right side, up to the Guard in the back of the Library, and choose the following options: - Oh. Okay... OR - Why? - Right...

[Open up the note and read it.] - [Done.] Click on the Librarian (optional) - No, thank you. Not yet...Crypt 1  Requires 8 Psy Power for completion. Ground Floor: Take the left fork and go to the end. Move the Hero as close to the abyss as you can, then click the lever and choose the following options: - [Attempt to move it.] - [Done.] Go back to the crypt entrance, take the right fork, and go through the falling sand and down the stairs. Floor 1: Move forward towards the two Desert Scorpions and defeat them in battle. Then, go to the skeleton and click on it, choose the following options: - [Exmaine more closely.] - [Exmaine it.] - [Done.] Walk forward until you reach an Owl Head sculpture. Go to the left (avoid tiles that have 5 dots on them: they're spikes and will diminish your health). Click on the rotating light pillar whilst standing directly to the right of the pillar, and choose the following options: - [Done.] Go to the end of the room and click on the chest. Choose the following options: - [Open it. - [Done.] Go back to the Owl Head sculpture and into the room to the right. Stand between directly to the left of the light pillar, and click on it. Then, go to the bottom-right corner of the room and click on the lever, and choose the following options: - [Pull the lever.] - [Done.] Now, a new pasage, previously blocked by doors, is open in the downward direction. Walk down from the Owl Head sculpture and repeat the \"turning the light pillars towards the Owl Head\" procedure twice. The position is kind of confusing, so follow this image: Go back to the place where the Owl Head sculpture was previously positioned: it is no longer there, but a staircase has been revealed. Descend to the next level. Floor 2: Go straight to the right and go down the stairs. Floor 3:&nbsp Go to the top-left hand corner of the room and click on the chest: - [Open it.] - [Done.] The Crypt map becomes available (go to \"Menu,\" then choose \"Maps\"). Go to the lever and click on it: - [Pull the lever.]&nbsp - [Done.] Go up the stairs. Floor 2:&nbsp Go towards the Owl Head sculpture; there, ghosts are surrounding the pillar. Fight them and defeat them. Go down to the Owl Head sculpture and go left. Make sure you're just outside of where the doors would close. Once there, click on the lever: - [Attempt to move it.] - [Done.] (The doors will close behind you, but it is still possible to move the lever afterwards -- just come as close as possible to the door and click on the lever) Go towards the Owl Head and up. There are stairs in the upper right-hand side of the room; go up them, and go to the left hand side of the room. Now, either look at the Crypt map, or simply go through the wall on the left-hand side of the room and blindly find the passage down to the western room. Then, repeat thrice the procedure of turning the light pillar in the direction of the Owl Head sculpture (use this picture) and go back to the place where that statue used to be. Descend to the next level. Floor 3: Repeat the \"turn light pillar\" procedure twice by standing directly to the right of each of the two pillars. Slowly go towards the second room. Notice the timing of the dart throws. As soon as the dart wave starts, walk toward the centre of the room, then wait and observe the dart wave from the other side of the room, get the timing right and run towards the last shaft of light. Stand directly to the right of the last light pillar and repeat the turning procedure. Go back to the room with the staircase, dodging the arrows as you go; a new staircase is revealed. Descend to level 4. Floor 4: Go to the chest and click on it (optional). - [Open the chest.] - [Take it.] - [Done.] The Blood Orb is now available (go to \"Menu\" and then click on \"Orbs\"). Go towards the big pile of books and click on it. - [Done.]East Ravinale  Enter the Library and approach the Librarian, choose the following options: - No, thank you. [Contact her with the news.] - Just think the words you want me to hear. - Sure. - We should--there is a huge cellar. - [Done.] You'll be teleported back to Baz's Manor (optional: go to the room with Fizooz and you'll find the pile of books stacked on the right side of the room). Go back to the Ravinale Library and click on the Librarian: - No, thank you. [Open up the note and read it.]&nbsp - [Done.]Battles Battle: Crypt Scorpions  This battle should be pretty easy. If your hero has a lot of psy power, then first use him to back stab the other scorpion. Use your other units to gang up on the two scorpions, with your hero. They both should go down in a turn or two, even if your hero can't destroy the first scorpion on his own.Battle: Crypt Spirits  This battle should also be quite easy if you do this: Gang up your whole team to the left; be sure to have Luca in your team. Use your non-psy team members to attack the Lesser Ghosts in the back. Use the Hero and Luca, along with Rahel using Bow 2, to kill the Ghost Knight.Crypt 2  Ground Floor: Go left of the staircase, avoid the arrows and ground spikes back there and pull the lever in the far corner. Go back to the staircase, the sandfalls will have turned off. There will be two inscriptions under, which read: The route to the head (The book room) is through the stomach (the first floor). As you descend into the body of the dead (the crypt), Beware the feet (Ghost Pit)- they are unclean (have a ghost battle). Beware the bowels (the searchlight room and sword room)- for you are meat. Press the pores (the buttons on the first floor)- don't press your luck (read the walkthrough ). Then go up the stairs to start the crypt. The Stomach: There is a button next to the staircase, press it. The room will fill with roving ghosts. It is very hard to avoid them, but if they do hit you it's only one battle against 6 cryo-ghosts. After a single battle, all the ghosts disappear. Now some of the blocks in the first floor will be gone. Next go down and take the first left. In the corner is another button, press it. More blocks are moved around. Go right and down until you reach the bottom right corner. Press the button there. Go up, left, and down in a giant U to reach the bottom left corner. Pressing this button will open a trapdoor that leads into the Ghost Pit. There is no other options at this point, besides this you are trapped. The Feet: The battle is a little harder, against four lesser ghosts, 2 cryo ghosts, and 4 ghost knights. After the battle, walk right and down to the staircase. There is a gauntlet of arrow traps. Wait for two of the diagonally fired arrows and run to the lever. Pull the lever, it opens a staircase at the bottom of the gauntlet. Watch the arrows and wait for an opening, run down and right, into the corner. There is a light source and a lever, pull the lever and walk up the stairs you just opened up. The Bowels (West): Go right. There is a chest between several spike indentations. They will not hurt you though, as you turned them off with the second lever in the Ghost Pit. Open the chest and recieve the map. Walk up, there is a circling spotlight, the rest of the room is dark. Walk right for a while, there is a secret passage. It will be pitch black, but move the mouse around until it turns into a hand, click and open the hidden chest. You get the yellow orb! Walk left until you are back in the bowels and get to the top of the room, snaking through. Watch when the spotlight goes over an area as there are plenty of spikes. The exit is in the top left corner. The Stomach (Part 2): You are back on the 1st floor. Go back to the start and press the first button again. Walk down and left to get the second button once more. THIS TIME, go right, down, right, up, and right to get to the button in the right top corner. Press it. The east staircase opens, don't take it yet. Walk down and left until you get to the left bottom corner. Press this button, which opens a hallway in the east room, then go back to the east staircase. Take it. The Bowels (East): Walk left. There will be a second room beyond the hallway. Watch out for the spinning swords and spikes. There is a chest in the top left corner that has 500 gold, and a button in the bottom left corner. Take the gold, press the button, and go back to the 1st floor. The Stomach (Part 3): Walk left and down to get to the south staircase. Take it. Esophagus: Go up and take the staircase. Head: This room has two turning spotlights. Unless you have the yellow orb equipped, you won't be able toproceed. Go up and left to find a chest. Open it to get another 500 gold. Don't walk up anymore, there is a spike. Go back down and walk right. Watch out for the spike by the boulder next to the spotlight. Go right and up until you reach the top half. There is a spike in the middle of the right side, watch out. Walk up the stairs at the top of the room and you made it! The Mind: Walk over to the chest, open it for the Violet orb. Grab the books and you will leave. Woohoo!Battles Battle: The Ghost Pit  Kill the greater and lesser ghosts first, as they're the most mobile. Run away from the Ghost Knights. Have Set heal while Luca transfers PsP. Kill the Ghost Knights one at a time.Crypt 3 Entrance / The First Floor  If you have 13 aptitude, you can move the levers fom a distance, making the puzzles somewhat simpler. First, you must walk around the plank-covered hole and go through the hallway to the left of the staircase (watching out for spikes that can pop up). In the hallway, you will find arrows flying from two spots on the walls. After they both shoot out twice, run past them and go up the stairs. you will find a room with blocks arranged around the floor, as well as spike tiles and a lever in the bottom-left corner. Push the farthest block on the right that you can reach to the right, and then keep pushing blocks on this side to work your way to the top right. Then, work your way along the top-left side, then on to the bottom-left to the lever. Pulling this will deactivate the permenant spikes at the north hallway. Proceed through there, then examine the tile. It will have a portion of a poem written on it. Head back out of here into the main room.\u00a0 Next, head through the identical hallway on the right side of the main room. Make sure you watch out for the arrows shooting from the sides, and follow the sam e pattern as the opposite hallway. You will enter a room with blocks going down a narrow hallway to a wider room, but the blocks are blocking your way. Move the first block on the left up, then move the first block on the right up twice. Now that you are in the larger area, go 1 space to the right, and then move the block directly north of you up. Then go 1 more space to the right, and push that block up once. Go 2 spaces left, then push the top block up. Push the block to your left 1 space to the left. Move 1 space left, then move the block below you down 1 space. You should be able to reach the lever. Pull it. Then go 2 space s above the spike tile, and move the block to your left 1 space left. Then go 1 space up, and move the block to your immediate left 1 space to the left. Move left 1, then push the block above you up. You should be able to pass the spike tile that is now permanently down. Read the tile which is located past the spikes. It will have the other half of the poem. Go back to the main room. Go through the center staircase. You will find another block puzzle, with a corpse in the top-left hand corner of the room. Move the farthest right block you can reach all the way to the right. Next, move the block above you up once. Move the block above that one to the right until you can reach the door. When it asks you what air is, type \"Death\" in the box. The door should open up to a hallway that leads to a staircase taking you to the second floor.The Second Floor:  \ufeffWhen you arrive on the second floor you will see two blocks and if you make your way left and right first you will see stairways but they are blocked with spikes, so be patient and first deal with the two blocks. Follow the instructions to push these blocks. I will use the following abbreviations. PU - push block up. PL - push block left, PD - push block down, PR - push block right. MU - move up 1 square, etc. Now start pushing the blocks as follows: PU the block on the right. MU, PL, ML, MU, PL, ML, PU, MU, PL, ML, MU, PL, ML, MU, PL. Now you should arrive at an open area. Proceed to go up and aim the lamp you see approximately 55 degrees above horizontal in the counterclockwise direction. This is towards the direction of the owl statue which you can find by going right and up by pushing the block on the top most part that you can reach: PR, MR (call this LOCATION X. You will need to come back here later), MU, PU, MU, PU. After aiming the lamp to the owl statue exit down the staircase you came from and re-enter. This time start with the left block and proceed as follows: PU, MU, PR, MR, MU, PR, MR, PU, MU, PR, MR, MU, PR, MR, MU, PR, MR, MU, PU, MU, PU, MU, PU. You should arrive at an open area. Now go aim the lamp you see about 55 degrees above horizontal this time from the clockwise direction (towards the statue). Doing this you will lower the spikes that blocks the right and left staircase in this room. Make your way to the right staircase and go downstairs. (If you go down from the left staircase everything will be dark and you will be forced to leave). Now you have to push a bunch of blocks. New abbreviation: PB - press square button. Follow the following instructions when you arrive downstairs: Start with the block on top: PR, MR, MD,PR, MR, PR, MR, PU, MU, MR, PU, MU, PL, ML, PU, MU.\u00a0 Select [Scan for thought impressioin.], and then [Continue Scanning]. This should tell you that the letters in the image is the word \"indication\". Make note of \"indication\" and the image that has indication written in the old alphabet. I suggest you make a table with a,b,c,...,z on a piece of paper to match each letter with the corresponding letter in the old alphabet. Right now you should know the letters of m, e, d, i, t, a, i, o, and n from \"meditation\" in the old alphabet. Exit to the stairs. Start with the block on top: PR, MR, MD,PR, MR, PR, MR, PU, MU, MR, PU, MU, MR, MR, PR, MR, MU, PR, MR, PR, MR. Stop here, call this location 1). You will need to come back here later. Now from where you are: ML, MU, PL, ML, MU, PU, MU, and PB. Select [Scan for thought impressioin.], and then [Continue Scanning]. This should tell you that the letters in the image is the word \"indication\". Make note of \"indication\" and the image that has indication written in the old alphabet. I suggest you make a table with a,b,c,...,z on a piece of paper to match each letter with the corresponding letter in the old alphabet. Right now you should know the letters of i, n, d, c ,a ,t, and o from \"indication\" in the old alphabet. Go back to 1) and: PD, MD, PR, MR, MD, PD, MD, ML. Stop here, call this location 2). From where you are: MR, MR, PR, MR, MU, MR, and PB. Select [Scan for thought impressioin.], and then [Continue Scanning]. This should tell you that the image is the word \"Reversal\". You now have the new letters r, e, v, s, and l in the old alphabet. Write this down if you made a table. Go back to 2) and: PD, MD, ML, PD, MD, ML, PL, ML, MD, PL, ML, MD, PR, MR, MD. Now click the red lever and select [Attempt to move it.] and [Done]. Go back to the staircase you came from and go back up. Now go to the staircase all the way on the left side of this room and go down the stairs. There should be a \"circly\" light in this room now for you to see. When the light shines in your direction you should see two blocks. Start with the top block and proceed as follows: PR, MR, MD, PR, MR,PR, MR PU, MU, PR, MR, PU, MU, MR, MR, and PB. Write down the words in old alphabet that you see in the image. Match these words in the table you created with the letters that you know. (Ofcourse you don't know all letters in the alphabet in the old alphabet so this is where guessing is required). You should have something like \"I t c e a s e s t o e x i s t i n d a r _ n e s s\" where _ means a letter you don't know in the old alphabet. (i.e not on your table). from this you should immediately deduce that the message is \"It ceases to exist in darkness\". Add any new letter that you now the it in the old alphabet to your table (in this case just \"k\"). Now from where you are: PR, MR, MU, PR, MR, PR, MR, PD, MD (call this location 3)), PR, MR, MD, PR, MR, PR, MR, PB. Again match the words in the image with the table you created you should get something like this (Again I suggest you write the words down): \"_ o _ _ i t _ i n l i _ i t s\" Ok this time you probably can't guess it so lets move on. From where you are go to 3). Now:PD, MD, ML, PD, MD, ML, PD, MD, ML, PL, ML, MD, PL, ML, MD, PR, MR, MD, MD, MR, and PB. Match the words in the image you see with your table and you should be able to get something like this: \"_ _ a t' s r i _ _ t is a l l t _ a t' s l e _ t. \" Now if you written the words in the image down and match their letters in your table you should be able to deduce that these two messages are \"you within limits\" and \"what's right is all that's left\". (In theory, the word \"you\" could also be \"boy\" or any other 3 letter words with the first and 3rd letter in the word from some old alphabet not known in your table.) Now make your way back upstairs and go to LOCATION X. When you arrive here go down to the door and click it. You should be able to figure out what to type here from the 3 secret messages: \"It ceases to exist in darkness\", \"you within limits\" and \"what's right is all that's left.\" If you still can't figure it out click this: hidden message. The word is there. After you open the door, go down the staircase to the basement. Also it is advised that you keep the table (if you made one) as it is useful in opening hidden treasure chests that require you to enter secret messages in order to open them around Cera Bella.Basement  \ufeffWhen you arrive here, go left and click the treasure chest and then click [Done.]. Now go right and down. You will meet some ghosts you need to destroy. It's the only battle in this crypt. (See battles.) After you win (hopefully), make your way down and left and then up and you will arrive in an open rectangular region with arrows. On your way here you will see a bunch of stairs. Ignore them; they are traps with spikes on them. Make your way to the northeastern corner of the rectangular region, avoiding arrows as best as you can. Now go up into the secret passage and make your way to the secret staircase and go down. Congratulations, you completed crypt 3. Open the treasure chest to get the azure orb and click the pile of books to return to Ravinale. Go back and talk to the librarian in the Ravinale Library until she adds Crypt 4 to your map.Battles Azur's Guardians  A battle with 4 ghost knights and 4 ghosts. Award: 540 Gold!.Crypt 4 Labyrinth  The entrance is at the bottom-right of the map on the 'E'Presentation  Basically,you have to get to a space nine tiles in front of you.The problem is the multitude of ghosts,the wall of cracked boulders,and the spaces favorable for the enemy to ambush you.Also,the space there is guarded by a greater ghost.There are also\u00a0 treasure chests in corners but you may want to focus on the battle.Strategy  This is a tactically hard battle even though the foes are ridiculous.You have to blitz trough the central path,but you can't just get to the special space because you are blocked by a wall of cracked boulders.It is recommended to take only the characters that are well trained as it is full of unwalkable spaces and your friends may encumber themselves or your sniping points.Secondly,you will want a short-ranged attack (especially this,but watch out in friendly fire is on) like Cryo Cross or a long-ranged attack like Light Bomb to either break the gate or soften the enemies ahead.Medium-ranged attacks(Dark Vortex,Pyro Hail,Fire Gate,Elemental Blasts) are unrecommended because they will be hard to focus on the target,and you might be encumbered by your allies.Thirdly:This is an attrition battle,the main danger is losing your psy points,thus you have to win quickly. The following orb set is recommended:Blue Orb and three of these:Violet Orb,Green Orb(be careful!this is useful only for getting the corner chests.),Indigo Orb(The Titan Shield may be expensive,but here it is a lifesaver.),Yellow Orb,Blood Orb. After thinking about this,there are four strategies: First(Cryo Affinity)(Hero,Qudssi,Griffin,Rajav,Set,Arman,Rahel,Malis/Naj with Big Shield): Move to a side of the frontern boulder and use Cryo Cross.On easier difficulties it might clear two boulders and two ghosts.Use then Qudssi and Griffin for the other boulder and a ghost.With Arman finish the last ghost.Then put Set close to the most fragile unit.After the enemy turn hold your hero and make the others kill the greater ghost careful to let your hero get quickly to the space because it respawns. Second(Light Affinity)(Idem,no eight character):Move either behind to hit the wall and two ghosts or forward to hit the greater ghost and two ghosts.If first,use the others to flank and wound as much as possible the last one and withold the last two ghosts.After enemy attack hit the greater ghost from the flanks to kill it and move the hero to the target. Third(Fire or Dark Affinity)(Idem): Use your elemental area attack as best as possible.Then use your allies to ensure the middle flanks.After the enemy turn,move straight to the target. Fourth(The tactical one,not depending on affinity)(Idem): If Cryo is your affinity,use Glacial Shield as soon as possible.If not,attack the barrage.Then,secure the flanks and withold the ghosts coming from sideways with Qudssi and Griffin.Rajav can sustain one of them.With Rahel and Malis or Naj smash the middle boulder(but if Rahel is strong enough to rip half of its life use Naj to give Cold Resistance to those who don't have it)and take Arman around the lower right wall to strike the greater ghost,careful to damage it as much as possible but NOT kill itAfter the enemy turn,use someone swift as Rahel or Malis or Arman to give the killing blow to the greater ghost and take the hero swiftly to the target.TRPG2 Mission 5  Before attempting this mission, it is advisable to train up the team more than for the previous missions put together: Shadowboxer having Dark Vortex, Festus and Anya both equipped with Big Shield, Helena delaing more than 10 damage with Whirlwind and all teammates having above 36 hp would really help for the last battle of this mission. Having the Crimson Orb equipped or the Hero trained up to have Vengeance could come in very handy in the second part of this mission. Also you can always go back to the Mechanic's Base and fight again, to gain some extra money, or fight Vagrant in Somnus. After completing mission 4, you end up in front of a room with locked doors. You find out that the 'workshop is behind those doors'. In order to open those doors, you'll have to go to the top-left side of the room, past a bridge guarded by the Mechanics and enter an area swarming with Bronze Golems, whom you have to avoid and go until the very end, see the color of the switch indicator, and on your way back change all the switches to the right color- then the door to the workshop will finally open.Battle One: get across the bridge to the workshop  In this battle having the maximum number of flying units can really help. One of the ways to proceed is as follows: use the Shadowlings (and the Hero, if Crimson Orb is equipped) to attack and preferably take down at least one of the two Energy Golems on the left side of the map, Niven's Trick Shot could come in very handy. Then, use the rest of the teammates to re-group on the strip and allow those that have long-ranged attacks to deal damage to the Marksman (e.g. Guy with Pyro Hail), located in the top-middle of the map. Keep an eye on the two Energy Golems on the bottom-right of the map- try not to place teammates in their line of fire. After dealing with the two Energy Golems on the left-hand side and taking out Marskman 1, heal any wounded units and attack the Red Spriggat with your Shadowlings, whilst ensuring that they don't come under fire from Energy Golems and the Marksman on the bottom of the map. Meanwhile, if you have Gamblin' Jack or Helena with high-enough hp, send them against the Bronze Golem and use the Energy Golems to help you defeat them (position attack unit such that an Energy Golem would also backstab the Bronze Golem). During the next few turns wipe out the Golem and the Spriggat, whilst making sure that your units stay healed, so Festus will probably be floating around quite a bit. After this, send your earth-bound teammates around the bend, whilst trying not to expose them to the Energy Golems and keeping to the centre of the map, so that the Marksman on the right-most side of the map can't hurt your teammates. A Mechanic Captain will probably make his way to the bridge by now, but he shouldn't pose any problem for the Shadowlings. By now, you can send Darkling or Niven to use melee attacks against the Marksman located at the very bottom of the map. The next part is really simple and several ways can be used to achieve a win: sending Niven and using his Trick Shot to remove both Energy Golems is the safest method, but could take slightly longer, on the other hand one could also send out Shadowlings and any other teammates with ranged attacks to the bottom of the bridge and gang up on the Golems. Finally, one can choose from a plethora of methods on how to get rid of the last Marksman: the easiest way is to gang up on him, box him in with the Shadowlings, whilst using Niven to attack indirectly and use the Hero or Guy to attack him with Pyro Hail, and that's job done.The Security Room  Next comes the infamous stealth mission, where your Hero will have to make way through six rooms filled with patrolling Bronze Golem guards. First, the Hero has to make his/her way to the last room, the Security Room. In room 4, there is a hidden passageway along the left side of the room, where it looks like it leads to a dead end--just walk to the left far a little bit then up, then right. If you get into a battle along the way try not to die or you will have to start all over again, as it is a solo battle; if you get into one that is. Once you reach the Security Room, there will be a big \"button\" on the far wall. Note the big button's color and go back to the other five rooms to change the small floor buttons to the same color as the big button. After returning from this part of the mission, the doors in the original area just after the Bug Pit will be open and you can finally destroy the Golem Workshop.Battle Two: destroy the Golem Workshop  This is probably the hardest battle you would've faced so far, and it's most adviasable for all your teammates to have high hp, as enemies in this battle all deal at least 10 damage per hit! Thus, one way to proceed is to send Darkling to the left side of the map and attack the Marksman with Shadow Blast, then send Shadowboxer to attack the Bronze Golem on the left with Mind Blast, positioning Shadowboxer in such a way as to force the Bronze Golem to face Shadowboxer and attack him, and in so doing, hit the Marksman with the Spin Saw as well (in the best case scenario, this should kill the Marksman). Next, use any ranged attacks available to destroy the Enery Golem in the middle, whislt sending one of the Fighters to ther right, to distract the second Bronze Golem (it's best to draw out the Bronze Golem to the bottom right corner, so both the Fighter and the Bronze Golem are far away from the fighting about to take place in the center of the map). Proceed then to use Shadowlings in destroying the first Bronze Golem whilst keep their hp high. The hardest part now would be to keep your teammates alive in the center of the map. It's a good idea to use the table in the middle as a buffer and send your teammates through the left side of the map (as it's easier to create a bottle-neck there), placing in front sturdier units and using ranged Psy attacks like Pyro Blast and Pyro Hail extensively. If your Hero has high hp (around 40-45) and Vengeance, then placing him up front and using Vengeance on the enemy could be rather useful. Using area attacks helps greatly here, so Guy and Shadowboxer will be kept very busy during this part of the battle, whislt Darkling can be used to backstab any wounded enemies into oblivion. The enemies in the centre will come in two waves, so this might give you time to heal up any wounded units and maybe send the stringer ones through the bottom or top of the map to encircle the surviving mechanics and gang up on them. Don't forget about the Fighter sent to distract the Bronze Golem- chance are that, throughout the battle you'll have to retreat the unit, heal and then return it to fight the Bronze Golem. Depending on how you trained your team, either the mechanics or the Bronze Golem will fall first, either way, group everyone together around the last one standing and finish him off. Also having bought the items from gelf can help you win this battle too.After the Battles  The victory will leave you in the Energy Golem workshop. It's a good idea to have a thorough look around, as, apart from finding a useful component to install on Flint (the Steam Engine, can be found in the top-right corner of the map, don't be afraid to walk on any debris you see on the floor in order to get to it), you'll also finding a Frost Spriggat standing around at the very top of the workshop. If you talk to him, be nice and play on his boredom, then he'll agree to join your party (this Spriggat, Grotius, is, in fact, Cerzak's son). Finally, you can go back to Somnus, where Tastidian will give you yet another assignment.Grotius  Grotius appears in Telepath RPG Chapter 2.Background  Grotius is a Frost Spriggat. His father is the Dissidents' leader Cerzak and his mother is one of the female spriggats murdered by the Shadowling Queen. He is an extremely moody teenager who doesn't like be told what to do--especially by his father.Involvement  After the Hero destroys the Golem Workshop, Grotius can be found in a corner. He can be recruited with some convincing. Also, if you talk to Nightling, you can get an blue orb from Grotius.Skills Strategy  Grotius becomes extremely useful with training. He can learn Frost Breath 2, which gives him a maximum attack range of 3 squares. This means he can be lined up behind two other characters when attacking an opponent. He can also attack three enemies in a row and use his Frost Armor to weather attacks.Quotes  \"And what about you? I mean, she's made you into a slave. Do you even remember the last time you were free to make your own choices?\"Trivia Character  Characters in TRPG 1, 2, and 3. Some Join the party, some don't.Flint (Telepath RPG 2)  Flint appears in Telepath RPG Chapter 2.Background  Flint is a slow moving Stone Golem. Both Helena and he worked as part of the Mechanics, but they were caught stealing and were punished by being thrown into the Bug Pit. This implies certain doom.Involvement  After getting thrown into the bug pit, the Hero can speak with Helena. The Hero can get Helena and Flint to join the team for a price.Skills Strategy  Flint may not seem as versatile as most characters, thanks to his lack of movement or good skills. However, you are able to equip him with powerful machines such as the Spin Saw. He can be very strong with those weapons. The Steam Engine is especially useful, since it can boost Flint's movement.Quotes  [The golem's eye fixates on you. He produces a series of grunts that sound like stone grinding against stone. You're not even sure if he's actually saying anything.]Trivia Gamblin' Jack  Gamblin' Jack appears in Telepath RPG Chapter\u00a01 and 2.Background  A guard at the Psy Academy, Jack loves to gamble. Some time during the Shadow War, he gambled away his freedom in an attempt to get his men and himself out of a bad situation, but ended up losing and becoming a slave. He is eventually purchased by Thallion.Involvement  With enough aptitude\u00a0(7 or higher), the Hero will recognize Jack. Jack will then ask the Hero to set him free by buying him from Thallion\u00a0for 500 gold. If the Hero pays Thallion 500 gold, Gamblin' Jack will join the Hero's team. If the Hero has an\u00a0aptitude of\u00a09 or higher, Thallion will accept the trade even if the Hero has less than 500 gold yet more than 400.Attacks Strategy  The gambling guard is an ace swordsman. Set him in front to take damage, and dish it out, and put a distance attacker or healer behind him. Once he gains Snake Eyes, his attacks can do massive damage. Later, he can also be a healer.Quotes  [When asked if he wants to gamble]: \"Now what kind of question is that? Does the sun want to shine? Does the wind want to blow? Name your poison kid.\"Trivia  After the Shadow War, Gamblin' Jack, impressed with the shadowling card game, Psy War, created a popular derivative: Gamblin' War.TRPG2 Side Quests  The following is a walkthrough for the many side quests and minigames in TRPG2.Lala's Basement  There is a green shadowling in a shack in Somnus. When you ask her how she likes living in the city, she gives you a quest to kill all the bugs in her basement. You simply go down the stairs and kill the bugs to get an award of 40 coins or an antique which is actually an orbDice  Dice is one of the gambling games you can play against Gamblin' Jack once you buy him from Thallion. To start off, each person wagers 5 gold coins and whoever wins a random roll will take to money from the other. The amount of money gradually increases the longer the game is played.Psy War  You can also play a card game with Gamblin' Jack once you buy him from Thallion: Psy War. Each player gets a hand of five cards with different values on them. Every turn, each player plays a card, and the card with the higher attack value causes damage to the player with the lower card. Some cards with lower attack values have special bonuses for playing them, such as a life bonus or a bonus to attack power, which will automatically be applied if you have enough psy points left to pay the cost of the special bonus.Pirate Pete's Treasure  Before you complete Mission 6, you can find Pirate Pete at Lake Alto. He gives you a quest where you have to find all his treasure chests before the time runs out.Malignus  In Somnus, there is a house with a chest and a staircase inside. If you can open the chest (requires 30 psy power), you can find Malignus, a Spriggat, underneath. He can let you replay several battles, like fighting Nelis and Tastidian.Nelis  Nelis aka the Shadowling Queen appears in Telepath RPG Chapter 2.Background  Nelis is the name of the Shadowling Queen. For centuries, she was the head of a monarchical government that has dominated political and religious life in The Shadowlands . She is a shadowy figure whose motivations and origin remain unclear.Involvement  Nelis is the Empress of the Shadowlands, and her war against the Dissidents drives the plot of TRPG2. For most of the game, she is regarded as a deity, although in the end, she is the final, killable\u00a0boss. According to Dean Lukas she has spread rumors of her own godhood to quash dissent.Skills  Fire Gate (Range: 3x3, epicenter 3 spaces from attacker, Damage: 20), Holy Blast (Range: 1/Every Space, Damage: 40/4) Resistance: LightStrategy  Nelis can be defeated at the end of TRPG2. She has two powerful attacks that hit multiple targets: Fire Gate and Holy Blast. Holy Blast does massive Light damage to a single target at close range, and a small amount of Light damage to all other characters on the screen. Fire Gate is a 3X3 square Heat attack with its center 3 squares away. She also has Light Resistance, so any Light based attack will only deal 50% damage. While Nelis may appear at first to have 999 health, she is in fact concealing her true health from the player. Depending on the difficulty at which the game is played, it may take several hundred damage before she will fall. Be sure to deal damage to her consistently, however, for she regenerates health each turn.Quotes  \"You... What do you hope to accomplish here? Do you wish to put an end to your existence? Flee. Enjoy what remains of your short human life. Or, stay--and perish in fire!\"Trivia TRPG2 Mission 7  This is the final mission. Tastidian tells you to go to the Psy Academy to ensure that it won't side with the Spriggats. Once you meet and talk to Piter, you regain all your memories and become exhausted. Once you fall asleep in your room, a man named Dean Lukas will be in front of you and ask you whether you want to side with the Psy Academy or with Tastidian. In order to beat this mission on Brutal without losing members, it is recommended to get at least 66 hp for the player, plus all his/her skills (except maybe Mind Shield) and other members's stats to at least 30. Playing the game on SinisterDesign and beating multiple times the battle with Hobbes, Locke and Roucheau can provide enough gold to do so.1) Siding with The Academy  (Recommended Orbs: Green and Black) This is the canonical ending, where you must seek to kill the Shadowling Queen, Nelis. This is extremely difficult, so it would be wise to train as hard as you can. Once you feel you are ready, go to Somnus, where you must face Tastidian. The first battle you have is with lots of Shadowling Soldiers and two Shadowling Guardians. The soldiers are pretty difficult to beat, but cornering them could help. You should try to take out the guardians as quickly as you can, because they are capable of doing massive damage. Once you've beaten them, you now have to fight Tastidian. He seems to have infinite health, but he doesn't. There is a bunch of shadowlings protecting him; first priority, take these out first. Once you 've done that, retreat, if you must, to heal yourself. Ultimately, you need to consistently deal damage to Tastidian, because he heals every turn. His attack makes this pretty difficult to accomplish, since it deals high damage to all units surrounding him. An effective tactic is to send Darkling and Shadowboxer to capture the squares on the left and on the right of Tastidian respectively, for they have Shadow Resistance to protect themselves against Shockwave. Meanwhile, the player gets behind his healer and attacks Tastidian with Pyro Blast or Vengeance\u00a0;. Keep attacking with your troops, and he will eventually fall within a few turns. The third battle isn't nearly as hard as the last one. It only has some Phantom Armors and Energy Golems. If you have Darkling, a good idea would be to shadowport behind enemies and attack them for backstab damage. Area-of-effect attacks are also helpful. The next battle won't be as easy...Fighting the Queen  It easy to lose members here. A lot of members. Nelis is very fierce, and it doesn't help that there are energy golems and phantom armors protecting her. First off, destroy the energy golems, and then take out the phantom armors. While doing this, try not to get attacked by Nelis, as both of her attacks are insanely powerful. After that, attack her with your most powerful units and don't stop. If one of your more useful units is in danger of getting killed, have someone else take one for the team by taking a hit with Holy Blast. (Your Hero can fill this role quite effectively with the White Orb equipped [note: not certain if it always works] and a sufficiently-leveled Feedback / Vengeance attack to follow up with on the next turn.) Basically, try to keep your healer, your main character, and main damage dealer alive until she finally goes down. And there, you've won the game!2) Siding with Tastidian  (Recommended Orbs: Green and White) If you side with Tastidian, you must fight Dean Lukas. This causes Anya and Guy to desert you. The fight that follows is extremely difficult. You must face the elite defenders of the Academy, and they get a free turn to pummel you at the very beginning. You simply must have Festus with Big Shield on the 5th slot to heal members as soon as you start. Make it your priority to kill the psy fighter with Light Bomb, or perhaps more easily, have Darkling distract him by Shadowporting out of formation and attacking him. The white orb will certainly will come in handy.Fighting Dean Lukas  Dean Lukas has a high amount of health and a far-reaching, powerful Light Bomb attack. However, that is his only attack. Once you have defeated his defenders, simply pin down Dean Lukas with melee units and he won't be able to hurt you (as long as you keep your other units out of Light Bomb range).After the Mission  After this mission, you have won the game. You have the choice of either starting a new game, or a new game+. A new game+ sets the game difficulty to the next tier. Plus, all characters in your roster will have the same stats as those when you beat the game. Finally, when you talk to Hellion about his chest, you get a hefty reward, as it contains a large amount of gold. The amount of money depends on the difficulty at which the final battle was beaten (5,000 on Easy, 12,000 on Normal, and 28,000 on Hard/Brutal). Further Notes:Shadowboxer  Shadowboxer appears in Telepath RPG Chapter 2.Background  Shadowboxer is Darkling's older brother, and one of the younger shadowlings to ever enter the Assassin's Cult. He is more serious than his brother, and is generaly more mature than him as well.Involvement  In the beginning of the game, Tastidian gives you three soldiers, Darkling, Festus, and Shadowboxer.Skills Strategy  Shadowboxer gains powerful attacks, including Shadow Blast and Dark Vortex, which can become valuable when attacking groups of enemies. Shadowboxer is also the second fastest character in the game, and can get Shadow Resistance the easiest, which aids in fighting against Dark Spriggats and Shadowlings. He is not as mobile as his brother, but when they have equal Psy Defense, Shadowboxer's health and psy points will be higher. Therefore, he is more durable than Darkling.Quotes  \"One of these days that little runt is going to get himself killed.\" \"Yeah, brother. What? You think we don't have families or something? You think we just sprout from magic beans?\"Trivia Niven  Niven appears in Telepath RPG Chapter 2.Background  Niven is a Knifethrower whose business is hindered due to the Shadowling Queen's constant wars. He isn't that good at missing targets and is against calling humans \"Fleshlings\".Involvement  In the beginning of the game, Niven asks the Hero to help him with target practice for 5 gold each, but he damages them for 2-6 damage. Later, he can be recruited by the Hero by either being persuaded to because \"Everybody loves a war hero\" (Requires high enough Personality) or by being paid 200 gold.Skills Strategy  Niven has an interesting knife ability later on, Trick Shot. This allows him to give room for distance attackers, while still damaging enemies. It hits the enemy 2 squares forward and one to the right. It's also noticeably cheaper to make Niven's attacks more powerful, because both strength and psy power are added into the damage.Quotes  \"When the Queen has blessed you with a talent like mine, you can't just go not sharing it with people!\" \"These wars... they make certain individuals in the city very rich. But not Niven The knife-thrower, I'm afraid. I'm a peaceful soul.\" \"Well, if it isn't the rude little human from before. We have nothing to say to one another.\"Trivia Tastidian  Tastidian appears in Telepath RPG Chapters 1 and 2.Background  Tastidian is an incredibly powerful shadowling who becomes the commanding general of the Shadowling Queen's army. Under Tastidian's orders, Noctus kidnaps the Hero's little brother, David. In exchange for David's freedom, the Hero agrees to be Tastidian's slave for three years.Involvement  As the Hero's master, Tastidian sends his slave on a series of missions. Free of enslavement, the Hero can choose to turn against the Shadowling Empire and fight Tastidian and his queen.Stats  Shockwave (Range: 1-2 Omnidirectional diamond, Damage: 25) Resistance: ShadowStrategy  Tastidian can be defeated near the end of TRPG2. He attacks with a Shockwave attack that hits all nearby units, though it does not harm enemies. While he may appear at first to have 999 health, he is in fact concealing his true health from the Hero. Deal enough damage and he will fall. Be sure to deal damage consistently, however, for he regenerates health each turn.Quotes  \"I am Tastidian, High Commander of Her Majesty's Army.\" \"Awaken. The time for your service is at hand.\" \"I cannot. All of us are slaves to something. You, to your conscience. Me, to my duty. I hope the afterlife is kind to you.\" \"It was very bold of you to do what you did little fleshing. You wilingness to risk your life for that of your sibling was admirable, in a way. But it was also quite foolish.\" \"Shocked into silence? Or are you merely frightened? Do not look surprised. You walked uninvited into my camp and now I am here in your room.\"Trivia Malis  Malis appears in Telepath RPG: Servants of God.Background  Malis is a shadowling with a spice business in Ravinale. The Cult have refused to do business with her on the basis that she is a shadowling, or \"Dark One\". She is extremely narcissistic. She is on the cusp of reaching middle age, as indicated by her purple coloration, and she is quite in denial about it.Involvement  After you defeat Fernatus, Malis will be in Baz's Manor, and after a conversation, she may choose to join you if you play to her personality, and avoid offending her. It also helps to have a higher Aptitude and Personality.Attacks Strategy  Malis is useful for going behind enemy lines and can be extremely mobile with the use of Shadowport and Shadowport 2. She can shadowport to conserve her speed, and her plentiful PsP and low-cost Shadow Blast let her attack easily. Be watchful, though, when she is behind enemy lines, as she will quickly become the target of enemies.Quotes  \"The name's Malis. I own a business dealing in the spice trade, and your new government is costing me some serious money. They won't allow exports to the Shadowling Republic, which means I have to ante my plume every time I come down here to collect a shipment.\" \"...I spend so much time rejecting males, I hardly have time for anything else sometimes. [You get a distinct feeling that she is never going to stop talking unless you interject.]\"Trivia Hero (TRPG 1 & 2)  This Hero that appears in Telepath RPG Chapters 1 and 2.Background  This Hero is a red-haired black cape from the Psy Academy. The hero has a brother, David, who must be saved. The Hero is also turned into Tastidian's slave in the Shadow War.Involvement  S/he is the main character.Telepath RPG 1 Skills Telepath RPG 2 Skills Strategy  The hero is a flexible character that can be played any number of ways.

With his mobility of 9, and both shadowport and shadowport 2, he can literally move anywhere. He can even Shadowport off the board!Quotes  \"The name's Darkling the Magnificent, Greatest Assassin in the Known World. But you can call me Darkling for short.\" \"I'm small, but damn quick! I love taking down healers and ranged units who think they're safety out of reach.

The genre is soundtrack.Trivia Charles Dalimar  Charles Nathaniel Dalimar is the main antagonist of the Ravenhearst game series.Biography Early Life  Charles Nathaniel Dalimar was born in the Blackpool Temperance Hospital to Abigail Dalimar and Alister Dalimar,\u00a0who was born in 1613, and died in the year 1882. For several years, he lived at home with his mother, Abigail, while she was working at Madame Fate\u00b4s Carnival as the \"Fattest Lady Alive\". \u00a0 Alister Dalimar was busy trying to become immortal at the Madame Fate Carnival with his crow named Tanatos, which has Alister's dark soul in his mind. Abigail, at home with her son, Charles, had him cook, wash dishes and clean the house, the house where she abused him. He was forced to cut her toenails, trim her nose hairs, and pop her pimples. The days were counted when he would be a good boy and he wouldn't be using the spank-a-tronic for punishment, when he was bad he would have been spanked by the spank-a-tronic.\u00a0 According to the sign in the basement, Charles served as a sideshow freak for Madame Fate's Carnival due to his reportedly long tongue (though this is the only reference to him having an abnormal-length tongue). During those years, while he was abused, he was obsessed with making locks that would make him feel safe and no one would hurt him anymore. He was so obsessed that at the age of 11, he was taken to Provincial Lunatic Asylum under the care of Dr. Robert Lunswiller. He also was Alister's doctor as well.The Asylum  Abigail Dalimar sent her husband, then, later, sent Charles to the Manchester Provincial Asylum at the age of 11 and stayed for 10 years. There, next door to Alistar Dalimar who was his father, who had lived in the asylum before. However, according to Charles, his father had taught him to create locks that can bind a persons soul, but it is unknown how this was possible, as his father had died over a year before Charles was sent to the asylum. He decided to leave the Asylum when receiving a newspaper article in which the arrival of Emma Ravenhearst in Blackpool was described and so caused Charles to directly fall in love with Emma. He first purloined liquid nitrogen from the Asylum\u00b4s laboratory to then break through the gully cover in the atrium by freezing and then destroying the cover. Charles Dalimar escaped at the age of 21 and revisited his mother to kill her. He put a bomb in an apple pie he made for her and blew her to pieces.Meeting Emma Ravenhearst  During the Blackpool fall dance, Charles met Emma Ravenhearst, who was from Iowa. Charles was immediantly obsessed and started to court her. He proposed to her after dating her for 5 months, but Emma turned him down under the circumstances that it was simply too soon. She eventually received a letter that her father was gravely ill. When Charles discovered she was about to return to America, he poisoned her to keep her for his own. Shortly after that he began building Ravenhearst Manor on land he had bought before. During the construction works one builder fell of the Manor and died. Driven by his psychotic madness, he continued to poison her even after inviting and fosting her in Ravenhearst Manor. Eventually he hired nursemaid Rose Somerset who became Charles' new obsession. He then imprisoned Rose and her two twin daughters, Gwendolyn and Charlotte, shortly after he murdered Emma with an axe. The reason for killing Emma was that she and Rose finally tried to escape Ravenhearst. The mortal rests of Emma Ravenhearst were stored by Charles in a coffin in a secret room in the basement which lays behind the wall. It is theorized Victor Dalimar\u00a0was born after Charles forced himself onto Rose. While his biological relationship to Charles has been confirmed, his mother has yet to be. A process in which Reginald Somerset, Rose\u00b4s husband, accused Charles of having kidnapped Rose and her daughters, Charles was discharged on September 2nd 1895.The Soul Device  In order to become immortal, Charles built a gigantic subterranean complex divided into three subcomplexes. One subcomplex were an underground city called Roseville where Rose has been imprisoned. There she has to work at an device which drew the soul energy out of her to keep her tormentor alive.\n The second subcomplex is a cave with a gingerbread cottage for Charlotte and Gwendolyn to live, a school house and a toyshop with a secret pass to another device where Charlotte\u00b4s and Gwendolyn\u00b4s souls were sucked out of them to empower Charles.\n The third subcomplex is an old cable car that can be used to reach the beach down the cliffs from were Victor\u00b4s cottage can be reached.\n Through a lift in a shop in Roseville Charles\u00b4 personal chambers can be reached were another device in form of a cylinder is standing. Charles is able to enter that device and receive new energy from his so called family to stay alive.\n Because of an unknown reason Emma\u00b4s mortal rests were not connected to the Soul Device.Return of Charles Dalimar  After the Detective freed Emma, Rose and the twins from Charles reign of terror he finally destroyed Charles life-giving machine. The Detective was able to destroy the whole device and burning down Ravenhearst Manor by using the device, that was normally used by Victor to repair the machine if something was not working as aspected, without removing the pressure cylinder which is absolutly necessary, because otherwise the whole machine could be destroyed in an explosion.\n It seemed that Charles was killed through the explosion however, his son Victor could escape through a time machine into the year 1895.\n In the past Victor started working on Charles\u00b4 new creation. Through a newspaper article in Escape from Ravenhearst it is known that Victor started kidnapping people until 2012. Somehow he was also able to bring his father back to life and created a \"prison\" for the Master Detective in another subterranean complex under the remains of the Ravenhearst Manor. Charles then created a device which is powerful enough to give life to the dead and is empowered by hundreds of souls of kidnapped Blackpool inhabitants. Charles and Victor also built a gigantic complex that is a resonable facsimile of Charles life which is later used as a \"prison\" for the Master Detective.\n Charles later sent a letter to the Master Detective without revealing his identity in which he hinted a connection between the missing persons and Ravenhearst Manor. The returning Detective is then forced to re-live Charles\u00b4 life and the souls of Emma, Rose and the twins are again captured by Charles and finally brought back to life! Caused by an unknown reason Charles became romantically interested in the Detective and forced him to a marriage. Charles died after the Detctive deactivated the new device and so burned down Charles new underground complex however, Charles cursed the Detective and promised to return and kill the Detective.Later appearances  In Fate's Carnival Alister used black magic to contact his dead son and tell him that he had embarrassed the Dalimar family. Later the Detective used the same kind of magic to contact Charles and receive the solution for a puzzle. \n In Key to Ravenhearst Charlotte, Gwendolyn and Alister tried to bring Charles back to life and had already created a new body for him with the skull of a raven as a head however, failed somehow in doing so. \n In Rewind Victor tried to bring Charles' soul from the past to the present, but was succesfully stopped by the Master Detective who destroyed Charles soul and then handed the remaining soul fragments to the Queen.Trivia Appearances Mystery Case Files: Return to Ravenhearst (soundtrack)  The soundtrack was conducted by the Berlin Film Orchaestra.

They have feelings for each other, but Lan didn't admit it until the end of MegaMan Battle Network 6, where in the epilogue it is revealed that 20 years later the two are married and have a son named Patch Hikari. The two have always been very close growing up. Mayl, being the more mature and intelligent of the two, is often having to beat some sense into Lan when he gets himself into trouble. The two do occasionally have oppositions, but the bickering only brings them closer. Mayl sometimes shows that she may have romantic feelings towards her lifetime friend. Roll and Megaman's relation strongly parallels that of Lan and Mayl's, though Roll is much more blatant with her affection towards Megaman. She was renamed Maylu Sakurai in the English anime and manga.

Lan is a bit of a spaz, and is also reckless. However, this is what defines his ability to bounce back, even after the severe trauma that he is often subject to. This behavior of his puts him at odds with his rival, the confident Chaud. His recklessness also allows him to be a risk taker, and his protagonism allows his constant divine favors (i.e. Leaping out of a 2-story window into the ocean and surviving). He though is kind and has a good heart, and his parents and friends are proud of him. Lan is constantly around his friends, hanging out with them, Netbattling, or sometimes pranking one another (like giving Dex a wedgie). His best friend, Mayl, who has lived next door to him since they were both very young, is with him always, since they were both very young, and carries a torch for him, although, naturally, Lan is too distracted to notice. Dex is Netto's constant source of Netbattle practice and male humor, and Yai is an intelligent young blonde who likes to share her wealth (and her... forward personality) with her friends. Lan is a sportsman with a particular love for Soccer and a excellent inline skater. His connection to MegaMan.EXE is second to none, and this allows him to reach revolutionary new heights in NetBattles, such as Full Synchro and Cross Fusion.Appearance  Lan has brown eyes and spiky, unkempt brown hair which he keeps out of his face with a blue bandanna around his forehead bearing the Hikari clan symbol. His attire consists of a white sleeved shirt with an orange vest, black shorts with yellow stripes, black ankle socks, and orange sneakers with black highlights that can turn into skates. He has also been shown to, in extreme weather conditions, tie the bandanna over his face and mouth.History  Lan Hikari is the youngest child in the Hikari clan, sired by Yuichiro and grandsired by Tadashi Hikari (the games' version of Dr. Thomas Light). He is the youngest of twins, the elder being Hub Hikari (Hikari Site -pronounced, and often spelled Saito-), who fell prey to a rare heart disease known as HBD. He also never met his grandpa because his grandpa died before the twins were born but still Lan loves his grandpa very much.Trivia MegaMan.EXE  MegaMan.EXE, known as Template:Nihongo in Japan, is the NetNavi (short for Internet Navigator) operated by Lan Hikari. He was created by the scientist Yuichiro Hikari, Lan's father. MegaMan.EXE is quite powerful, and along with his operator Lan, is a very skilled virus buster. He is also Lan's twin brother, Hub Hikari (Saito in Japan) who died at birth, because of a rare heart condition known as HBD (unknown meaning). Dr. Hikari then used his data to revive him as a NetNavi, MegaMan.EXE.History  MegaMan.EXE (Rockman.EXE in Japan) is a unique NetNavi in the fact that he is the ultimate result of the Navi Project, an experiment undertaken by all of the SciLab and led by Yuichiro Hikari. The Navi Project was designed to successfully graft a human's DNA and Soul into a NetNavi. The process took a NetNavi's data and made it able to adapt to most any situation. However, as Lan and Hub were identical twins, it was presumed that if Hub's exact DNA were to be used, the 'Twin Link' affect would take place, and any pain that Lan or Hub would experience would affect the other. As such, Dr. Hikari had modified his DNA by .01% (this is presumed to be eye color, as despite being identical, they have different eyes). This remaining .01% was programmed into the Hub.Bat (Saito.batch) if ever the need to reset Hub's DNA to the original was necessary.Description  MegaMan is small, for a NetNavi, but his abilities are many and great. He wears a blue jumpsuit, sporting white-green stripes down his sides, ending at his blue boots which are tipped with black soles. He has two yellow shoulder guards and his blue helmet has two ridges running along the top These ridges come to a stop at the helmet's base and allows his dark hair to stick out in 4 spikes. He has green eyes and, unlike most other NetNavis, an overall human appearance. As a customized NetNavi, Rockman sports the symbol of the Hikari Clan on his chest and both sides of his helmet. This symbol is a red circle with a black line running diagnally through the center which ends in two triangles, all of which are surrounded by a gold ring.Skills, Stats, and Abilities MegaMan Battle Network characters  charactersMegaMan Battle Network 6  MegaMan Battle Network 6 is the sixth and final installment in the MegaMan Battle Network series by Capcom, released on the Game Boy Advance in 2005 (Japan) and 2006 (USA, Europe).

He runs a railway express through the Net, transporting goods and Navis.Features Removed Features  With the Boktai series' dwindling popularity in the US, Konami had decided to not release a US version of the 3rd game. As such, Capcom had decided to remove most of the Boktai related things in the game. Gun Del Sol EX, Otenko, Django 1-3, and Hakushaku (Known as Hack Jack in US chips)1-3 were chips that were removed from the US version. Some, however, can be obtained via Gold Mystery Data. Django and Hakushaku chips both freeze the game, But the Crossover PA (Django 1, Django 2, and Django 3 in order) still works. It, and Otenko, however, use a white dot rather than the actual sprite. The normal GunDelSol chips still exist naturally in the game, aswell as the Bat Key and Django poster in Lan's room. Another removed feature was additional areas in the game. Undernet 3 and the Immortal area were removed from the U.S. version. Graveyard 1 was also removed, while Graveyard 2 remained, renamed simply as \"Graveyard\". The Bat Key has a different function in the U.S. version. It opened the Immortal area in the Japanese version, while in the U.S., it simply opens a purple gate in the Graveyard which has the Attack MAX NCP.Battle Changes  Various effects have been changed from the previous installments. Enemies on Ice panels no longer take double damage from elec attacks, but now get freeze status when hit with an Aqua attack. Enemies in Freeze Status take double damage from Breaking Type attacks. Another new status effect is \"Bubble\", normally caused by the Bubble Star chip series. Enemies will be encased in a bubble, unable to act, and will take double damage from the next Elec attack. Lava, Sand and Water panels do not make a return, however, but other new panel types exist. The chips \"Coming\" and \"Going\" Roads make draw panels, which do as the name describe. Another panel, which is rare and cannot be made via chips is the Geyser, which periodically causes fire damage to those standing on top of it and may be removed if hit by an Aqua attack.Folder Building  Chips are now restricted depending on their MB, and this has hence resulted in several chips coming from being Mega chips to Standard chips now, allowing the player to load more Navi chips into his folder. A Tag System also has been introduced, where the two selected chips (both chips' capacities must not exceed 60MB) are \"tagged\" and always appear with each other in the Custom Screen. Additionally, a notable number of chips have been given the * code, inclusive of some Navi chips, allowing more fluid unicode folders to be constructed in the game.Other  With the destruction of the Dark Chip factory in MegaMan Battle Network 5, Dark Chips are all but gone. That means that Battle Chips which used to be exclusive only to Dark MegaMan in previous (e.g. Anubis, Muramasa and Static) can be used by normal MegaMan now, while still holding their usual effects.Boss Characters  In order of appearance:NetNavi  Derived from the term \"Internet Navigator,\" a Template:Nihongo, or Navi (\u30ca\u30d3 Nabi) for short, is a key concept in the MegaMan Battle Network series of video games, developed by Capcom, as well as the MegaMan NT Warrior (Rockman EXE) anime and manga. NetNavis also have a minor role in MegaMan Star Force, a separate series that takes place 200 years in the future of Battle Network.Purpose and function  A NetNavi is a sentient, or semi-sentient, computer program with artificial intelligence designed to be an assistant for the operator and resides in his or her Personal Terminal, abbreviated as \"PET\". Specifically, the PET is a multipurpose device that is capable of acting in numerous functions, such as sending and receiving e-mail, acting as an alarm clock and calendar, and acting as a cell phone. Each of these functions is controlled by the NetNavi that resides within the PET under normal circumstances. A PET is, however, also capable of connecting to computerized devices, referred to as \"Jacking In\" (Plug-In), in which case the NetNavi is transferred to that device and may roam around it, affecting programs contained in that device as required, and moving through that device to any other devices connected to it, such as moving from a specific computer to the larger Internet. In addition, NetNavis may function as anti-virus software, directly combating the offending programs in an activity called \"virus busting\". Two Navis can also battle one another in \"NetBattles,\" and are designated by the extension \".EXE\". When a NetNavi is defeated in these battles, they are usually logged out to avoid permanent damage, though in MegaMan NT Warrior, MegaMan was completely deleted. NetNavis are given a unique personality that often reflects upon their operator's personality, and usually develops a strong friendship with their operators. NetNavis can also be used as assistants in their operator's occupation. Malicious users may use their Navi to hack into secure computer networks and commit crimes. Though these NetNavis are not technically viruses, they are treated as such. Functionally, these NetNavis are analogous to the Robot Masters of the original Mega Man series. Indeed, many of the NetNavis in the Battle Network series are similar in name, appearance, and concept to their corresponding classic Robot Masters, although not all Navis have a Robot Master equivalent, or vice-versa. There have been a few NetNavis based on characters from other Mega Man series as well, such as Colonel from the X series and Glyde from the Legends series. NetNavis have the ability to upload Battle Chips for use in battle against viruses or each other. Certain NetNavis have elemental stereotypes that define their fighting styles and techniques.Main NetNavis  The Battle Network series revolves around several main NetNavis that act as protagonists, as well as a group of NetNavi villains. All of them debuted in the first game.Other NetNavis  Below is a list of NetNavis organized by their game debut.Common Navis Battle Network Battle Network 2 Battle Network 3 Battle Network 4 Battle Network 5 Battle Network 6 Network Transmission Battle Chip Challenge Phantom of Network  The following Navis appear in the mobile phone game Rockman EXE Phantom of Network, as well as episodes 21-26 of Beast+.Legend of Network Made-for-TV MegaMan Star Force References Bass.EXE  Bass.EXE is a optional boss from the MegaMan Battle Network series that appears as the ultimate challenge in each game. Like in the original series, he is the anti-hero/hero of the Battle Network series.Biography  Bass.EXE is a mysterious and solitary NetNavi. He was created as part of a project to develop an independent NetNavi that does not need an operator and could get abilities from viruses and Navis. This is what makes him one of the most deadly Navis in existence. He was blamed for disrupting the Net and was attacked by officials, when in actuality, Alpha was the cause. He survived his attack and used his Get Ability program to keep himself alive and become stronger until he could get his revenge on the humans. Eventually, he stole the Life Aura data from SciLab, and encountered MegaMan on the Net, but was defeated. In MegaMan Battle Network 2, he played a larger role in the plot, where the Gospel Netmafia was trying to clone him through the use of BugFrags. This failed, and the clone mutated into the giant Gospel Megavirus. The monster overcharged the server 600% before MegaMan could destroy it. In MegaMan Battle Network 3, as well as being implied in the previous game, it was later revealed that Wily was behind everything, and was trying to copy Bass in order to free Alpha. Wily allied himself with Bass, who helped steal Alpha's data and the TetraCodes. In exchange, Wily proposed to give Bass the power to attack the humans. Prior to the climax of the game Bass notices MegaMan and challenges him after his battle with FlameMan.EXE. Because FlameMan got in his way Bass swatted him aside since he wanted to fight MegaMan himself. To his disappointment MegaMan provided no challenge (he is actually fought at that point game but is impossible to defeat because he can't be damaged), but just as Bass was about to finish him one of the Official NetNavis appeared to protect using the Dark Aura. Goaded by the boasts of its power, Bass attacked the Navi and the Dark Aura barely withstood his power. Bass likely would've finished him off if Wily didn't call him away. Later Bass aided in freeing Alpha. When MegaMan tried using the GigaFreeze program, Bass revealed that he could control it and stopped it. At the climax of the game Bass revels his past the everyone - he was initially created by Dr. Cossack, but was blamed for the incidents caused by Alpha, and was left to wander through the Undernet, with a scar across his body and a grudge against humans. Bass then smashed and absorbed the Guardian program, which was the last thing keeping Alpha sealed away. Bass is then fought and defeated by MegaMan (this is the only time that Bass is fought in a battle that's part of the storyline). Wily betrayed Bass and let Alpha swallow Bass, but got eaten too. After Alpha's destruction, Bass was near death, but found by a remnant of the Gospel Multibug Organism, who merged with Bass and saved his life, forming Bass GS. After Serenade's defeat, Serenade mentioned that the only other Navi who could defeat him was Bass. Bass GS consumed at least 300 BugFrags, courtesy of MegaMan, and attacked the Blue Bomber to test this new power. After a close battle, Bass lost, and it is revealed that he has lost most of his memory while fused with Gospel. He then vanishes from the Secret Area. In MegaMan Battle Network 4, Bass resurfaced in the Undernet, and later Black Earth. MegaMan accidentally woke the Dark Messiah, who attacked MegaMan wielding the power of the Dark Chips. Bass lost again, and fled to Black Earth where he fought MegaMan one last time after the defeat of the Dark Soul Navis. In MegaMan Battle Network 5, Bass could be encountered as the Chaos Lord, an amalgamation of the Dark power in the Nebula Area. He also appeared when MegaMan gained the power of the Bass Cross. Bass's final battle was in Cyber City, against MegaMan. Having challenged the Blue Bomber in both the Undernet and the secret Graveyard zone, he went to the Underground, former prison of the Cybeasts, and absorbed their data fragments and gaining the power of the Cybeast of the opposing version. After forcing MegaMan to fight a clone of Beast-Out MegaMan, Bass moved in for the kill, but was defeated. It is unknown if he survived the last battle, although Lan suggests so by convincingly saying \"Bass is Bass\". In each game he appears in, Bass's final form is the hardest boss in the game. Bass usually has a unique \"form identifier\". Where most navis would be 1-2-3 or normal-EX-SP, Bass's ultimate forms have been, variously, BassDX, BassGS, BassXX and BassBX amongst others. Bass is a immensely powerful Navi capable of easily defeating many strong navis.Personality  Bass's personality is added to during the first three games. In the first game nothing is known about. In the second because Bass is still only briefly seen not much is seen about him. What is shown is that due to his own pride, he hates anybody that would try to create copies of him. After his battle with MegaMan, he displays shock in that MegaMan could hurt him and leaves. This and some events in the third game indicate that Bass likes fighting, but he's only interested in stronger opponents. The third game reveals far about him. Because Bass felt betrayed by humans, he grew to hate them and longed for revenge. He displayed no sense of loyalty as well. When he first wanted to fight MegaMan, even Bass was working Wily; as he didn't care that he attacks FlameMan, one of his \"ally's\" subordinates. After being freed from Alpha, Bass has no memory of his past but retains his interest in fighting which causes him to continue to challenge MegaMan. But still, sometimes he assists MegaMan, mostly in the anime. It's believed that there is still good in him. The only one he ever cared about was his \"Father\" Dr. Cossack but after his creator abandoned him it broke Bass's heart making him what he is now.Normal Forms Ultimate Special Forms Abilities  Bass has tremendous potential that no other Navi ever had and is considered to be the strongest Navi in the MegaMan Battle Network games. He possesses plenty of attacks, abilities, and a constantly changing arsenal throughout the games. Bass is also by far MegaMan's strongest opponent.Other media  In the anime MegaMan NT Warrior, he and Gospel where created from data of PharaohMan.EXE by Wily. At first he has no memories and wanders the Net in a curious, confused state. However when Gospel attacked the Net, he got in it's way and made it leave. He later kidnaps MegaMan in order to find out who he really is. Bass reads MegaMan's mind and learns sbout his origins. After that, he attacks Gospel and initially defeats him. Bass tries to absorb him so that they ould become one again and gain his powers but Gospel is too strong and Bass' data disperses and is absorbed himself. After Gospel's destruction, Lord Wily was interested in where Bass was when Kid Grave suddenly gets back up. The robot is possesed by Bass and he walks away. In MegaMan NT Warrior Axess, his appearances are short. He appears once in his Kid Grave body when Lan and his friends cornered Allegro. He claims that Allegro was a robot he created as a brother but was disappointed in him and destroyed him. He reappears in the pit where ShadeMan.EXE was trapped when he was overthrown by LaserMan.EXE and shatters the tomb he is in, freeing him. He then watches the battle between ShadeMan and Dr. Regal and LaserMan Cross Fused but leaves when he realizes ShadeMan lost. In Rockman EXE Stream, he plays a more prominent role. He is seeking power and kidnaps and attacks MegaMan.EXE for his Ultimate program but is forced to retreat when ProtoMan.EXE joins the battle. He appears again in the Net to try and infiltrate Duo.EXE's comet but is defeated by Slur and is banished to the Undernet. He resurfaces in Rockman EXE: Program of Light and Dark. He initially fights against MegaMan because Dr. Regal manipulated him but tries to kill Regal for doing so once he realizes it. He and MegaMan team up to fight Nebula Grey but they are defeated. However, MegaMan gives Bass his Ultimate Program and both Navis fuse and, forming the synchronized Bass Cross MegaMan, which promptly proceeds to defeat Nebula Grey effortlessly with tremendous power. After its defeat, Dr. Regal opens a portal to try and delete them. MegaMan, escapes but Bass' fate is unknown.  He is last seen in a battle against Slur, at the end of Stream. This time, it is implied that he has absorbed the remnants of Nebula Grey, and proceeds to delete Slur.NetNavis  NetNavis are Internet Navigators from the MegaMan Battle Network series, that live inside of PETs, PErsonal Terminals.MegaMan Battle Network 5  MegaMan Battle Network 5, known in Japan as Template:Nihongo is a game from the MegaMan Battle Network series released in 2004-2005 for Game Boy Advance with two versions: Team Colonel (Team of Colonel) and Team ProtoMan (Team of Blues). Later, MegaMan Battle Network 5: Double Team DS, known in Japan as Template:Nihongo, was released for Nintendo DS in 2005, which includes content from both GBA versions together and extras.Release Date  Team Colonel+Team ProtoMan JP:2/24/05\nUS:6/21/05\nEU:6/10/05 Double Team DS JP:7/21/05\nUS:11/1/05\nEU:4/13/06\nAU:4/12/07Double Team DS  MegaMan Battle Network 5 Double Team DS is, essentially, both Team Colonel and Team ProtoMan versions of MegaMan Battle Network 5 packaged into one Nintendo DS game (though the games are still seperate, so all elements from one game are seperate from another), with a few new features, including the new \"fuan\" Emotional State. In this state, the Emotion Window would turn pink and the player would yell something into the microphone. If they succeeded, MegaMan would gain some randomly selected combination of two bonuses from instant Full Synchro, HP recovery or a barrier. This game features also:Characters Team Colonel Team ProtoMan Others Nebula Darkloids  Darkloids have no operators and guard areas for liberation.Changes from previous versions  The largest change in BN5 would be the introduction of Liberation missions, which blends the traditional tactics of the game with turn-based strategy games. The player has a set number of turns where he must attempt to complete the Liberation mission if he wishes to get one of its better rewards. This is also the opportunity where he can take control of different Navis other than MegaMan, and do battle using these Navis. Dark Chips now have a library of their own - and they can be inserted into the folder, complete with their own element and code. They are restricted to 3 per folder, and can be used to activate the new transformation - Chaos Unisons. They allow for the player to use the sacrificed Dark Chip as their charged shot without its side effects, at the risk of having to time it properly, lest they face its harmful side effects when it backfires. Soul Unisons also have undergone some changes too. Their charged attacks are now Buster-dependent, and Navicust parts have been introduced so as to allow their duration to be extended. DS chips are now obtained by defeating boss Navis, and can be obtained if you S-rank Beta versions, or score a rank of 8-10 for Omega versions.See also Tory Froid  Tory Froid is a character from MegaMan NT Warrior. He is the son of Dr. Froid and operator of IceMan.EXE. He only appears in the anime and is mentioned in the games. Dr. Froid is captured by Ms. Madd and Tory has to flood the city to make Ms. Madd release him. IceMan is defeated and his father is released. Troy also takes part in the N1 Grand Prix but is defeated by Mayl and Roll.\u00a0 Techinally Tory actually appeared in the first BN game, however his appearance was so minor that he was never referred to by name, or given a unique sprite.Tesla Magnus  Tesla Magnus, know as Template:Nihongo in Japan, is the current operator of MagnetMan.EXE. She obtained control of MagnetMan after her father Gauss Magnus was jailed for his actions in Gospel. Tesla joined Team Protoman after nearly killing Lan's friends on Oran Island, hoping her company would benefit from Nebula's demise. In spite of her father's incarceration, she appears to resent him for undisclosed reasons.Personality  Tesla can be selfish and mean spirited as evidenced in the mining scenario. She is also wuite vain as she is obsessed with looking young and reacts angrily to comments about her age. However, she does care for others which is shown when MagnetMan.EXE is absorbed into the Dark Galaxy.MegaMan Battle Network 5  She first appears in the Oran Island Mine in Team ProtoMan.EXE version of the game. she's using mining machines to dig up Magnometal as a way of relieving stress (Wierd). This however causes Lan's friends to fall down a pit caused by weakened floor structure. Lan breaks into the mine but Tesla refuses to stop the machine, telling him to do it himself. Meanwhile, the mining machines are raining rocks on his friends. Lan manages to shut down the machines before his friends are buried. Then she joins team ProtoMan and takes part in the Liberation Mission against ShadeMan.EXE with MagnetMan. She later gives Lan an invitation to a party on a boat that she doesn't plan to attend. She also is affected by the Soul Servers planted by Nebula and fights Lan when he attempts to shut them down. Tesla also takes part in the strike against Nebula's base and teams up with Lan to open the first security door but stays back after losing MagnetMan.EXE. She and the rest of Team ProtoMan shows up to support Lan but is incapitated by SoulNet. After Lan defeats Nebula Grey, Team ProtoMan disbands and they all go their seperate ways.Rockman EXE Stream  Tesla frees her father from prison and starts the Neo-WWW which causes various crimes. It gets worse for the Net Saviors when she obtains a Synchro Chip from Gauss, and hence gains the ability to Cross Fuse with MagnetMan. After Dark MegaMan takes her hostage and takes over the Neo-WWW, she joins the Cross Fusion team in fighting the Asteroid Navis and Duo.EXE. She also reappears with in Rockman.EXE Beast with the rest of the Cross Fusion Team to fend off the Zoanoroid's attack on the human world.Appearances Roll.EXE  Roll.EXE is a character of the game series MegaMan Battle Network, manga, and anime of MegaMan NT Warrior. Rolls appearance is a pink outfit similar to MegaMan's blue outfit. Rolls outfits are both the same in both anime of U.S.A and Japan. Rolls voice actor/actress in the U.S.A is Lenore Zann and in Japan is Joh Masako.Biography  Roll.EXE is Mayl's NetNavi (short for Internet Navigator). She is a kind-hearted Navi with healing powers.The official website also referred to her as hip and cool with the heart of champion NetBattler. Just as Mayl resists Dex's affections, Roll resists Gutsman's attempts to ask her out and has eyes on Megaman.She is close with MegaMan and the two of them are not quite as shy (or in Lan's case oblivious) about their relationship as their operators are.Video Games  In the Battle Network series Roll is a supporting character to the lead character MegaMan. Roll does not fight but talks to MegaMan offering many pointers and helpful suggestions. Roll is a helper to MegaMan when ever he needs her assistance. She is always there no matter what the consequences. She is the only Navi who's chips appeared in all 6 games. In 5 of those games, the chips were almost always given to Lan by Mayl at different points in the story. She has always had 3 chips, whereas in the 3rd game, all other Navis had a V4 and V5 chip. In the fourth game, Roll is a boss character that is randomly encountered in the second tournament. After her defeat, she gives MegaMan a new Soul Unison. The only game where her chips aren't listed with \"V2\" and \"V3\" is Battle Network 5, where she has \"SP\" and \"DS\" chips. She regained the V2 and 3 chips in the 6th game, where EX and SP chips were used.Anime  In the MegaMan NT Warrior TV series Roll is a fellow NetNavi working with MegaMan to help stop the evil WWW (World Three) from their disasterous plans. Rolls operator is Mayl Sakurai a friend of Lan Hikari the operator of MegaMan. Roll has many attacks such as her Roll Blaster as she used in MegaMan NT Warrior (EXE) episode 8 Hot Tempers against Torchman or her Roll Control which she used against Wackoman in the episode Wacky Maddness & Blazing Battles!. In Axess: Episode 4: Soul Unison!, Roll was up against Flashman was causing blackouts all over Akihara, Rockman attacks him and Roll accidentally hits Rockman with her aqua tower, almost deleting him. Netto takes Rockman to Scilab and Yuuichirou begins the repair process. Angry at herself Roll goes back to fight Flashman. Roll holds him off as much as possible while Megaman is repaired. Flashman admits to being amused by her but easily defeats her. Just as she is about to be deleted, Rockman appears and a Soul Unison is activated. It\u2019s Roll Soul and Flashman is defeated by the power of Roll Arrow.Powers and Abilities  Roll has quite a few abilities at her disposal that make her a formidable foe.Relationships Name  Roll's name is a play on the \"Rock and Roll\" genre of music.Anetta  Anetta is a girl from MegaMan Battle Network 3 that loves nature, and joined the World Three because Wily made her believe that destroying the net society was the only way to preserve nature, even if it requires sacrifices. She first appears in the game after the defeat of Sunayama and DesertMan, wearing a nurse outfit. In the middle of Mamoru's surgery for HBD, Anetta causes havoc in the hospital with her NetNavi PlantMan to search one of the TetraCodes. Lan stops PlantMan and the hospital returns to normal, but Anetta succeded to obtain the TetraCode. She later appears with Mr. Match protecting Castle Wily, and the two fight at the same time using Full Synchro with their Navis, but were defeated. After the incident, she was taken into custody with the other WWW members and sent to hospital.MegaMan NT Warrior  In the anime, Anetta first appears in episode 26 of Axess, \"Anetta's Revenge\", where she believes Chaud was responsable for deleting her Navi, Silk, and wants revenge. She holds her PET as if she wants Silk revived and then she could thank her for her recovery. This would require that SciLab do a salvage operation to recover Silk's data AND frame, the only 2 ingredients needed for reviving a NetNavi, and put those 2 parts in a NetNavi Recovery Program. This would make sense as she has a dream on what Silk might've looked like. It would also make sense to assume that losing her NetNavi must be tough on the girl's heart. When Anetta goes to bed, she holds her PET as if she would want nothing more than to see that nurse that helped her learn to walk again. She thinks that SciLab could find Silk's data and frame, and bring her back in that red PET with her symbol, which looks like a bandage. It's clear that kind of revival would make revenge useless. But, due to Anetta's caring personality, and in that RockMan EXE Stream episode 44, it is implied that Silk was revived at some point at the end of Axess, or possibly at the start of Beast/Beast+, as she's a lot more cheerful, whereas in Axess, Anetta's depressed when she goes to bed, but gained a happy feeling when she met Chaud and Lan. She even made them her homemade food, which Chaud and Lan were reluctant to eat at first, but soon after Anetta gave it to them, they tasted it. Given Chaud and Lan's reluctancy to eat her food, it's implied her parents never gave her cooking lessons when she was a kid, or sent her to her hometown school. It's implied that Anetta's school didn't have a Home Economics class, given her somewhat bad cooking. It's implied that Silk could've lived on inside a Navi, like HeatMan.EXE. This would mean that Silk is not entirely gone, and Mr. Famous could've seperated Silk and whatever Navi she lived on as at the end of Axess or Beast/Beast+. This would've contributed to Anetta's cheery personality, and that she actually had some fun in the sun, willingly, whereas before that episode, she would've been VERY depressed, lying down in a recliner and having that recurring dream about her Navi, Silk. Anetta states that before she was in the hospital, she was in a terrible car accident. She needed to be taken to DenTech Hospital. It was there that she met who would later become her nurse, Silk.EXE.Trivia  Anetta goes swimming in RockMan EXE stream episode 44, where she finally has some fun in the sun. It is implied that Silk was her nurse when she was in the hospital. This was probably because whomever made Silk didn't want her patient to get critically hurt. Another reason is that Anetta's parents couldn't pay her astronomical hospital bills, so they gave Silk Netcash to pay them.

It was released for the GameBoy Advance.Story  The game follows the 10 year old Lan Hikari and his NetNavi, MegaMan.EXE.

Template:BN-stubSlur  Template:Nihongo is a fictional character in the MegaMan NT Warrior anime. She is voiced by Akeno Watanabe in the original version of the series.History  Slur is Duo's subordinate, exclusive to the anime, and the last remaining NetNavi of the planet that created Duo. She is Duo's main means of communicating with Earth, and serves as the instigator of conflict throughout Stream. It is she who tests humans for their worthiness to survive her master's judgment; she appears before people and offers them Asteroid Navis, special Navis that may take the appearance of MegaMan's past foes. These Navis boast superior strength and versatility to their Earth counterparts, and in most cases, are immune to conventional methods of dispatch, such as elemental weakness. Slur also provides humans with Dimensional Chips, through which Asteroids may materialize as gigantic versions of themselves in the real world without a Dimensional Area present. While her actions themselves may be interpreted as evil, Slur states Duo is not responsible for Earth's impending erasure - the humans themselves are to blame, for they use the Asteroids for selfish gain. The evil energy cultivated by the Asteroids is sent to Duo's comet, where it awaits usage as the \"erasure wave\". Because she foils Bass' (Forte) attempts to take Duo's power for himself at the beginning of Stream, sending him flying into the depths of the Undernet, the vengeful Navi returns to delete her cruelly with the powers absorbed from Nebula Grey following the events of Rockman EXE: Program of Light and Dark at the end of the series by impaling her with his arm.Powers and abilities  As an extraterrestrial NetNavi, Slur's powers are heightened beyond those of regular Navis and even Duo's Asteroids. She is able to levitate and travel back and forth through the Past Tunnel with speed greater than the norm, and does not require any external assistance in transcending space-time, capable of tearing open portals in the net to take her where she needs to go. Her abilities can be exercised from great distances, and have been shown to reach Earth from Duo's comet in space. Her defenses are also virtually impenetrable; she survives injuries that would prove fatal to regular Navis, such as a triple Program Advance or sword to the chest. Many of Slur's attacks involve a living form of wiring that sprouts from beneath her sleeves. She is able to shape this wiring into weapons (swords mostly), which instantly take on the appearance and density of the object in question. In addition, she can strangle, bind, or electrocute her victims with these wires, but does not necessarily need to be within close proximity; most of the time, she conjures wires out of thin air. Slur's other ability harnesses the power of her aura. Often, Slur transforms into either a sphere or sliver of light and rams her enemies. She can also concentrate the energy from her aura into concussive bullets projected from the palms of her hands, or create a ring of this same force to cause explosions.References See also Eugene Chaud  Eugene Chaud, known as Template:Nihongo in Japan and as Chaud Blaze in English anime and manga, is an Official NetBattler and operator of ProtoMan.EXE. Chaud is extremely skilled due to the fact that he spends much of his time training with ProtoMan.History  Chaud is the son of IPC's (BlazeQuest in the English anime) president (Shuuseki Ijuin), and the operator and creator of ProtoMan.EXE (Blues). His mother died while he was still young, and Chaud was forced into becoming the vice-president of his father's corporation, a position which contributed to his initial cold attitude towards Lan Hikari (Netto Hikari). As the series progresses, he gains more respect for Lan, and also begins to open up to others, smiling more often. He does not, however, lose his serious outlook during battle, nor does he act impulsively before thinking. Why he was so cold was becaus he had to put up with his father's emotional abuse. In the games, Chaud is an Official NetBattler, who meets Lan while investigating a water shortage caused by WWW. He was introduced as a ruthless operator who took his job seriously and would delete any Navi who got in the way, and originally saw Lan as a pest, but they slowly became friends. Though the same age as Lan, Chaud has progressed much more quickly through his education, and by the sixth (and final) game, he's already a college student. The ending of the sixth game reveals that he grows up to become the leader of the Worldwide Officials (IPC's president in the Japanese version). This incarnation of Chaud wears ProtoMan's Navi mark on the back of his vest for the first three games, unlike the anime and manga. In the anime, Chaud retains his personality from the game, though his respectful side develops much quicker than in the aforementioned medium. He is the victor of the first series' N1 Grand Prix, defeating his opponents in mere seconds. In Axess, he becomes a Net Saver (Net Savior) and gains the ability to perform Cross Fusion with ProtoMan, but falls into depression after giving a Dark Chip to ProtoMan in order to defeat the Darkloid leader, ShadeMan.EXE. Because the process ultimately transforms his Navi into Dark ProtoMan (Dark Blues), Chaud feels responsible for his friend's suffering, and sets out to rectify his mistake. Chaud remains an important character after his appearance in Axess. In Stream, he's one of the thirteen people who receive the Crest of Duo, a mark on the palm of his hand that signifies his courage, strength, and destiny in aiding against the defeat of Duo.EXE. However, for most of Stream, Chaud is in Netopia (Ameroupe) on official Net Saver business, often partnered with Raoul. Also in Stream, Chaud and his company introduce a new PET design (the PET III, or \"Progress PET\"), which amplifies Cross Fusion ability (and essentially gives both Lan and Chaud new Cross Fusion designs that are carried out for the rest of the anime). In Beast, Chaud is one of the five characters who are sent to the parallel world of Beyondard. Before reuniting with Lan, Raika (Laika), and Dingo, Chaud is partnered with Maylu. Also, due to the upgraded Link Pet used in Beast, Chaud is also given the ability of flight during Cross Fusion via jet-boosters on the bottom of his boots. Chaud remains a very regular character throughout Beast+, aiding Lan in many battles. Chaud's Japanese name (Enzan) translates to \"flame mountain\". This reference was translated in his English name through \"Chaud,\" a French word meaning \"hot\". The anime followed suit by adding in the unique surname of \"Blaze\". Furthermore, being a French word, \"Chaud\" is supposed to be pronounced with a silent \"D,\" but it is incorrectly pronounced. In the English games, Chaud is the character's family name, though he is only referred to as Eugene during his introduction of himself is the first game. The anime changes Chaud to being his given name.  Unlike most of the main characters in the Battle Network Series, Chaud's name isn't a pun off of a computing term.Yuika  Yuika is a character from the MegaMan Battle Network series. She appears in MegaMan Battle Network 6 and MegaMan Beast. Her NetNavi is CircusMan.EXEMegaMan Battle Network 6  Yuika is a member of the WWW. She first appears in Central Town advertising a dance festival at central area 3. Once there, she uses CircusMan.EXE to drain the energy out of the NetNavis there. She catches one Cybeast but not the other. Then she runs after the Netpolice arrive. Yuika takes part in a mission to capture MegaMan.EXE and is sucessful. Then Yuika, Vic, and Ito break away from the WWW and form their own group. But they lose MegaMan.EXE and have to retreat. They show up again to kidnap Iris.EXE and are sucessful. Once they have Iris, Baryl tries to rescue her but the ex WWW members beat him up and are about to kill him when Joe Mach shows up and drives them away. Yuika and the others appear again during the final battle against Lan. Their NetNavis are deleted but they are about to attack Lan themselves when Chaud, Mayl, Dex, Yai, Mick and Tab show up. Yuika, Ito and Vic jump off the pavilion and are knocked unconscious. They are later arrested for their crimes.MegaMan NT Warrior  She appears in Rockman Beast and Beast +. She and Blackbeard live in Beyondard and work for the Beyondard Dr. Wily.Duo.EXE  Template:Nihongo is a fictional character in the MegaMan Battle Network series of video games and the MegaMan NT Warrior (Rockman EXE) anime. His design is based on Duo of the original Mega Man series. In the anime, he is voiced by Kenji Nomura in the original version of the series.History Game  Introduced in MegaMan Battle Network 4, Duo is the operation system for an asteroid-based rocket poised to destroy Earth. The villainous Dr. Regal attempts to control Duo, and the program itself acts as judge of the human race, deeming it evil and unworthy of survival. For this reason, Duo intends to destroy the planet, effectively eradicating the species so that there is not a single trace of evil energy left. Although his story essentially ends at the game's conclusion, he makes anonymous appearances in subsequent installments, usually providing players with exclusive Giga chips.Anime  In the anime, Duo is a god-like entity, created by an alien race, that seeks to cleanse the world of all evil. The extraterrestrials that oversaw his genesis intended for Duo to expand their already vast computer network beyond the boundaries of their home planet, and he was therefore installed into a shuttle that was launched into space, eventually becoming a comet once it reached the outer limits of the atmosphere. Duo, however, defected from his original objective, as he felt that space did not require the network's useless influence, thus it was destined to be destroyed. From his comet, Duo laid waste to the planet, but not before some of its inhabitants escaped on a floating city, eventually landing on Earth during the age of the dinosaurs. Researching methods of halting \"The Cybernetic God,\" the survivors came across a process similar to Cross Fusion, but were unsuccessful in completing a viable hybrid being, and only their city remained intact by the time it is discovered in Stream, shielded by technology akin to the \"Dimensional Areas\". Duo's comet makes several trips to the Earth, crash landing thirty years prior to the events of Stream, and again fifteen years later destroying the airplane both Dr. Regal and Ms. Yuri (Yuriko Ozono) as children were traveling on. He turns the two into probes to monitor human life, then leaves them in the ocean to be found and raised by Dr.Wily. When Regal initiates a Dimensional Area that envelops the globe at the end of Axess, Duo is alerted to the chaos and sets off to perform \"Earth Erasure\". Giant viruses materialize in the real world and cause havoc, and ultimately the Earth ceases to exist. However, coming across Lan Hikari (Netto Hikari) and Chaud Blaze (Enzan Ij\u016bin), he becomes intrigued by Cross Fusion and decides to spare the world so that it may prove to him that it merits survival. He reverts the damage caused by his advent, then marks thirteen individuals with the Crests of Duo, those chosen specifically for such a purpose.Powers and abilities  Duo possesses a variety of extremely potent abilities, many of them manifesting themselves in the form of space-age weaponry. His mighty fists are capable of crushing those that oppose him, and may detach through rocket propulsion to strike his enemies. His chest cavity houses explosive artillery, which is launched in either a direct or homing fashion, as either mines or missiles. This cavity may also compress in on itself to release a powerful focused laser beam that fans out at certain points along the spectrum. His most devastating technique involves expelling a flaming ball of energy, resembling a face, from his head. In the anime, Duo also possesses the ability to separate Navis and operators from Cross Fusion with a mere thought, allowing them to take on physical bodies while in his comet.See also  Cite error:  tags exist, but no  tag was foundSerenade.EXE  Template:Nihongo, also known as \"S\" and \"UnderKing\" (however, in Japanese version, Serenade is female), is a NetNavi from MegaMan Battle Network 3, and is the ruler of the Undernet. When Lan is asked to obtain the Forbidden Program called \"GigaFreeze\", which is able to freeze Alpha in case it awakens, he goes to Undernet and has to defeat several ranked Navis to reach \"S\", the rank 1 Navi that protects the program. After defeating rank 2, MistMan (White version) or BowlMan (Blue version), he discovers the Navi is called Serenade and is located in the server of the Undernet. MegaMan finds the server in the Ura Inn, where Serenade's voice can be heard and says that if he want the Forbidden Program, he must be a \"Chosen One\" to hold it, or the program would freeze him forever. MegaMan is able to take it and leaves, and Serenade is surprised to see that other Navi is able to hold it. Later, MegaMan tries to use the program against Bass when he was taking Alpha after DrillMan's defeat, but it sees he is the other \"Chosen One\" mentioned by Serenade and is able to stop the program. It's believed Mamoru is Serenade's operator, as he has Serenade's emblem on his wheelchair, and his father created the Undernet. After completing the game and completing other quests (like defeating Beta Navis and collecting all normal BattleChips), the player can enter in a Secret Area from the Undernet server, where he fights against DarkMan and JapanMan before meeting Serenade. Serenade recognizes MegaMan's power for being able to defeat JapanMan and DarkMan, and says the source of his power is mercy, and he wins because he loves and respect his enemies. After defeat, Serenade reveals he fought against Bass in the past, winning after a battle that last days. MegaMan receives Rank 1 and a side-quest will be available after logging out and them returning to the Secret Area, a time attack against several Alpha NetNavis with a Extra Folder. The player can obtain the BattleChip Serenade S (White version) or DarkAura A (Blue version) if a new record is set in all Navis.Abilities Lord Wily  Lord Wily, also known as Mr. Wily, and Template:Nihongo in Japan, is a fictional character in the MegaMan Battle Network series of video games and the MegaMan NT Warrior (Rockman EXE) anime and manga. In the anime, he is voiced by Katsumi Chou in the original version of the series. In the game and anime continuums, Dr. Regal is his adopted son, while in the former, he also raises Baryl (Barrel), and in the latter, cares for a young Ms. Yuri (Yuriko Ozono).History Game  In the Battle Network series, Wily is a robotics expert who was previously the best friend and prime competitor of Dr. Tadashi Hikari's research into computer networks. The two were often in direct conflict, as they battled over the rights to various government projects. Wily's research, however, was pushed aside in favour of Hikari's vision of internet expansion, prompting the scientist to pursue a life of crime through the use of the viruses and NetNavis created from his hated rival's technology, with his ultimate goal being the destruction of Net society. In the first game, Wily forms the NetCrime syndicate World Three (WWW) to cause havoc in the cyberworld, and unleashes the Life Virus (Dream Virus) by combining four elemental programs, with the intent of hacking military networks around the world to launch missiles. His plans are foiled by Lan Hikari (Netto Hikari) and MegaMan.EXE (Rockman), who destroy the virus in the knick of time. In MegaMan Battle Network 2, Wily resurfaces as the true mastermind behind the NetMafia, Gospel, manipulating a vulnerable child named Sean Obihiro (Shun Obihiro) to do his bidding. Together, they attempt to forge a copy of Bass.EXE (Forte), but end up accidentally creating the Gospel virus-beast instead. Again, Lan and MegaMan defeat Wily (not seen in the game), and it would not be until MegaMan Battle Network 3 that he returned. At that time, he reforms World Three and sets his sights on awakening the prototype internet Alpha (Proto). He is successful, but is himself consumed by Alpha, and later rescued by authorities. In MegaMan Battle Network 6, Wily resurrects WWW for the third time, capturing the Cybeasts (Cyber Beasts) Gregar (Glaga) and Falzar (Falzer), and placing them into giant Copybots (Copyroids). He employs Iris, Colonel's younger sister, as means of controlling them to bring chaos to the real world. Lan, MegaMan, Colonel, and Iris band together to oppose Wily, and the scientist ultimately decides to give up his dream of destroying the Net after seeing Colonel and Iris sacrifice themselves to destroy one of the Cybeasts. Despite being caught in the explosion of his headquarters, Wily survives, and resolves to working alongside Lan's father over the course of the next twenty years.Anime  In the anime, Wily does not deviate too far from his video game counterpart. He is still the leader of WWW, but instead of creating the Life Virus as he does in the first game, Wily seeks the \"Ultimate NetNavi\" (PharaohMan) in order to achieve his goals. He does this through the use of his team of NetNavis, all of whom are from the first game. Though his goals at first appeared to be to destroy Dentech city, he sends his whole group to participate in the N1 Grand Prix. All four of his human operated NetNavis failed at this task as most were defeated almost instantly, he makes up for it be having two more henchmen working for him, who are later revealed to be Solo NetNavis (who can operate without operators) BlasterMan and StoneMan. They succeed in taking down every Navi they fight, but are taken down in the semi Finals by MegaMan and ProtoMan (Blues). Wily believes from this that one of the two finalists must be his ultimate NetNavi, and watches the finals from his lair. Although a clear winner, the combatants awaken the true ultimate NetNavi, PharaohMan, who proceeds to cause destructions to mankind deleting MegaMan in the process. Wily then makes it his goal to capture PharaohMan, using an army of BlasterMan and StoneMan clones. Although PharaohMan is weakened in a battle with MegaMan and ProtoMan, then imprisoned by Wily's forces, he retaliates by destroying his base of operations while making it clear that he would rather be deleted than serve a human. During the second season of EXE, Wily emerges from hiding as the force behind Gospel (Grave in the English anime), but is thwarted by Lan and MegaMan. From there, he fades from the storyline of Axess, but returns in Stream as a character of neutral alignment and walks with a missile-launching recycling cart. It is during Stream that his relationship with Dr. Regal and Ms. Yuri is addressed: they are his adopted children, both of whom washed up on shore near his island research facility after Duo rescued them from a plane crash. Wily's past self plays an important role in the fight against the Cybernetic God, as he aids Baryl in traveling to the future to join the other twelve Cross Fusion members. A parallel version of Wily makes an appearance in Beast. This doppelg\u00e4nger hailing from Beyondard is nothing more than the remains of Wily's consciousness, stored inside an \"Android Brain\". Using the \"Synchronizer\" powers of the child Navi, Trill, he claims the Super Cybeast (Super Cyber Beast) Grezar as his new body, but is killed in a confrontation with Lan and MegaMan.Personality  Wily is a truly devoted villain, like any of his incarnations in the Mega Man franchise (except for the Legends part). He is driven by madness, greed, and rage from his failure to defeat MegaMan and (indirectly) Dr. Hikari, who he hates. This insanity seems to grow more violent over time, as his plots become more haphazard, and his regards to the sanctity of life drift away completely. He is, however, overly persistent, able to walk away from any setback and start anew. In the endings of MegaMan Battle Network 5, Wily approaches his wayward son Regal and tells him that he was not the greatest father he could have been, erasing his memory of the past ten years. He mentions that he would never use the SoulNet (Kokoro Server) like Regal had to take over the minds of others, proving that he is not entirely evil.  At the end of Battle Network 6, Wily has seemingly given up his former life. He cooperates with the authorities interrogating him in the aftermath of the Cybeast incident, and even sends Lan a letter of thanks for showing him the error of his ways. In the series' epilogue, it's revealed that he also created new Colonel and Iris programs designed to help in peacefully maintaining the Net.Colonel.EXE  Colonel.EXE, a NetNavi, and his operator Baryl (Barrel), a Netopian (\"Ameropean\") official battler, were introduced as a duo that form an elite team to stop Nebula in MegaMan Battle Network 5. He was based off of Colonel from Mega Man X4.History  Colonel.EXE is a powerful NetNavi who fights for the good of justice and leader of Team Colonel. Colonel fought MegaMan only to test him. Later, Baryl asked Lan to join Team Colonel in order to battle the \"Dark Chip Syndicate\", Nebula, Lan agreed when he heard that his father was kidnapped. And just like ProtoMan, Colonel was captured and turned into a darkloid by Dr. Regal. In Battle Network 6, Colonel was revealed to be working for WWW. Colonel's personality dramatically changed, and all he cared about was doing his job, even if it meant be having to delete anyone in his path. After losing to Lan and MegaMan, Baryl decided to help them stop Dr. Wily. It was later revealed that Dr. Wily created Colonel as the perfect Navi (strong, smart, fast, and kind; in addition, Colonel possessed a weapon control program). When Baryl's father went to war, he left Baryl's in Wily's care. Wily soon forgot about his thoughts for revenge and raised Baryl as his own. But Wily' revenge against net society returned when he learned that Baryl's father was killed in battle. Wily then removed Colonel's kindness and weapon control program, making him a military navi and used the programs to create Iris.EXE, Colonel's younger sister. Wily soon made a program that would cause Colonel and Iris to explode if they were to ever merge again. Wily's plan was to build two giant Copybots in order to contain the cybeasts, Gregar and Falzer. Iris decide to help MegaMan and Colonel to defeat the cybeasts. After a very tense battle, Colonel and Iris defeated one of the cybeasts, but the other cybeast took over MegaMan again. Colonel and Iris where still hurt from their last battle. In desperation, Colonel and Iris fused together and separated the cybeast from MegaMan's body. With parting words, Colonel self-destructed, destroying the cybeast at the cost of their own lives. This caused Wily's kindness to return. 20 years later, Wily created two incarnations of Colonel and Iris. Colonel is a system that finds and deletes viruses and criminals on the net. Iris is a system that finds and repairs any damage done to the net. With these two systems, the net was able to grow in leaps and bounds.Abilities  Colonel has several but effective attacks available in MMBN5 and MMBN6.Soul Unison  MegaMan receives this soul after Colonel is rescued from a dark soul. Megaman must sacrifice an obstacle chip in order to perform Colonel Soul. With Colonel Soul, MegaMan's MegaBuster is replaced with a sword and his charged shot becomes ScreenDivide. Any obstacle chip used becomes a ColonelArmy soldier the attacks any nearby enemies. MegaMan can replace his sword with any non-elemental attack chips that doesn't freeze time and can be used as a charged shot. Once a non-elemental chip is equipped to MegaMan, it cannot be used again until the end of the battle.Viddy Narcy  Viddy Narcy, known as Template:Nihongo in Japan, real name Hidenosuke Yamashita, is the operator of VideoMan.EXE. He is a narcissist producer with purple hair that claims to be \"beyond gender\". He participates in the Eagle/Hawk Tournament from MegaMan Battle Network 4 to use the prize money to change VideoMan from analog to digital. He cheats to win, but was defeated by Lan. In the anime he was a member of the Neo WWW.Trivia  Template:BN-stub", "Battle Realms Wiki": "Battle Realms Wiki Battle Realms Wiki Welcome to Battle Realms Wiki!  The largest source of useful information about the real-time strategy game Battle Realms, its universe and the community.Dragon Clan  The Dragon Clan is one of the four major clans of Battle Realms.Description  Those of the Dragon live and die by ancient martial codes and philosophy and believe that power is worthless without wisdom and discipline to guide it. They live according to feudal traditions, each member of the clan fulfilling his role, for excellence and balance in life, and this philosophy permeates their lives. The beliefs of the Dragon Clan are expressed most perfectly in their fighting units - their talented swordsmen, archers, and geisha healers embody the Dragon traditions of bravery and wisdom. In the right hands, this clan is like a perfectly balanced sword; a tool that may bring order and peace back to a land torn by civil war.History  Long ago there were many more clans than there is today... chief among these clans was the noble Dragon Clan. The Dragon Clan was an ancient clan deep with hundreds of years of history and was ruled by wise and honourable rulers. It all changed with the coming of the mysterious Horde. Without warning, the relentless darkness that was the nightmarish Horde consumed all in it's path. The mightiest and most skilled warriors of the Dragon Clan rallied under the banner of the Dragon's Clan leader, Tarrant The Elder to halt and stem the dark tide. Alas, the sacrifice of the noble warriors were in vain as the Dragon Clan's losses were too grevious and the Horde had seemingly endless numbers. Knowing inevitable defeat was close at hand, Tarrant The Elder gathered the remmants of his clan and fled. As his stalwart soldiers fought on to stall the Horde, the remaining Dragon Clansmen fled towards the south as far as possible from the coming horrors. Knowing that the Horde will eventually find them, Tarrant The Elder decided to use the Dragon Clan's last remaining treasured artifact, the Serpent's Orb, an artifact of immense power granted to them by the Dragon Clan's totem guardian spirit in days long gone to protect his people. As death's door was fast approaching, Tarrant The Elder ordered his people to flee to safety as best they were able. Alone, Tarrant The Elder stood his ground and unleashed the wrath of the Serpent's Orb upon the encroaching darkness. That was the last anyone saw of him and what occured next seem to baffle all who witness it. The Horde that nearly destroyed the Dragon Clan was vanquished as a searing light spread across the lands and thundered the world. The earth rumbled and moved all around them as the darkness was held back. In the end, nothing was left of the Horde and Tarrant The Elder. The plateau from where they escaped from was destroyed and only from a distance could they lay sights on their devastated homeland. Strengthening their resolve, the remmants of the Dragon Clan swore an oath to forever honour the sacrifice of Tarrant The Elder forever. Hence forth from that day, they renamed themselves the \"Serpent Clan\" in honour of their memory and fallen heroes. The newly formed Serpent Clan the succesor to the old Dragon Clan rebuilt their homes and restored the glory of their ancient clan. The Serpent Clan flourished and prospered under the guidance and rule of the descendants of Tarrant The Elder. As time passed however, the Serpent Clan begin to deviate from their honourable roots. The people began to commit wicked acts, crimes, stealing and deceiving one another. So the people of the Serpent Clan separated themselves from the ideals of the Dragon Clan and thus The Serpent Clan eventually began to be known as evil and wicked. The Serpent Clan mastered the use of gunpowder that the ancient Dragon Clan knew years before and created muskets and cannons and began to ridicule the concept of \"honour\", thus becoming Yin followers, deviating from their previous worship of the ideals of Yang. The last straw that seperated the Serpent from the Dragon was their lack of belief; they refused to ever again venerate the idea that a Dragon deity or spirit watched over their clan, for they had seen no miracles that could be attributed to the spirit. Instead, they saw Tarrant the Elder's power as his own; in their eyes, Tarrant the Elder vanquished the Horde not because of his beliefs, but rather because he was the strongest among them. Lord Oja, the Serpent Clan leader, was assassinated by unknown forces seven years ago. His first son is dead, and his second, Kenji Oja, the \"Little Dragon,\" fled the country. None yet knows what happened to the young prince, and none can guess at whether he will follow the long-forgotten noble ideals of the Dragon, or the self-serving ways of the Serpent. Time, as it always does, will tell.Dragon Units  TIER 1 TIER 2 TIER 3 NON-TIERDragon Structures  Clan-specific Structures Common StructuresDragon Zen Masters  Zen Masters take on the role of heroes in the world of Battle Realms. They are summoned through the keep and by spending Yin/Yang points. Below are the following Zen Masters of the Dragon clan. \u00a0Kenji Oja  Kenji is a Zen Master of the Dragon Clan or the Serpent Clan in the original Battle Realms campaign, \"Kenji's Journey\". He serves as the game's one of the main protagonists, other being Grayback.Background  Kenji Oja, also known as \"the Serpent's Son\", is the last heir to the throne of the Serpent Clan. He has an older brother named Taro who is a prideful coward that often pretends to be more powerful than he truly is. Kenji is also a direct descendant of Tarrant the Elder, the famous Serpent Clan leader who led his people away from a life-threatening force that mysteriously appeared from the north and who miraculously formed the protective island where the inhabitants of Battle Realms currently reside. As a child, Kenji was known as \"Little Dragon\" for his fiery debates with his father, Lord Oja, who ruled over the Serpent people in a somewhat less honorable manner than Tarrant and his other ancestors once did. Whether he viewed his father's rule as merely ineffective or outright dishonorable is up for debate, and he made no secret about his misgivings. When Kenji was seen hovering over the body of his father's bloody corpse that one fateful night, he was immediately blamed for the murder of his father, and to avoid certain death Kenji fled the Serpent Clan for a self-imposed exile that lasted nearly seven years. Kenji recently returned to his homeland to set things right... Although what Kenji Oja now classifies as \"right\" is anyone's guess. While on his way back into the homeland, Kenji sees a peasant telling him to run from Shinja's men before fleeing the scene. The Bandits soon make their apperance, spot Kenji and tell him to slay some villagers if Kenji is interested in joining Shinja's \"band\" of bandits. It is at this point where Kenji must decide the fate of his journey and his own moral path...Kenji's Journey (Dragon Path)  Kenji decides to aid the peasants from the bandits, knowing that they will surely perish without his aid. After a tiring battle, the peasants manage to rout the bandits, thanks to Kenji's aid. Kenji then meets Otomo, his old friend and mentor, though a peasant recognizes Kenji as a murderer exclaiming that \"He killed his own father!\". Otomo apologises for the peasant's behaviour (and reprimands the peasant), and invites Kenji to take tea in his house, an offer Kenji accepts. In the aftermath of the ensuing discussion they decide that they must free the people from Shinja's Band of Bandits and the other Clans fighting over the rest of the land.Kenji's Journey (Serpent Path)  Kenji decides that the villagers must learn their place and aids the Bandits in their assault. Although the peasants try to fight off the bandits, they are helpless when Kenji joins the fight. With no mercy being given from neither Kenji nor the Bandits, the village is burnt to the ground and sacked. The Bandit Captain of the assaulting group recognizes Kenji as the heir to the Serpent Throne and offers his allegiance (and the allegiance of his men), which Kenji accepts. Kenji then decides that he will rule the entire land and all its peoples with an iron fist, due to his belief that Shinja's and Otomo's rivalry and strife has weakened the Serpent Clan.Outfits & Fighting Styles  Kenji goes through three different changes in both the Dragon & Serpent storylines:Appearances Fighting Styles  Kenji will inspire his allies after successfully executing these three attack animations: After receiving the Dragon's spirit in the Dragon Clan campaign, Kenji acquires a glowing aura, high stamina, greater resistances, and overwhelming attack power & hitpoints.Trivia Quotes (Move)  BothDragon Serpent Quotes (Attack)  BothDragon Serpent Quotes (Kills)  DragonSerpent Quotes (Heal) Quotes (Death) Notes Zymeth  Zymeth is a Zen Master of the Lotus Clan, and is also the clan's acting leader.Overview  Lord Zymeth is the evil and remorseless leader of the magically driven Lotus clan. Politically, Zymeth is cunning and extremely treacherous; he forced his way into power by disposing of his political opponents, including the high priestess Sethess, who would have otherwise been the most legitimate candidate for the leadership of the Lotus Clan at the time. In fact, Zymeth was almost single-handedly responsible for the great war that erupted between the Wolf, Serpent, and Lotus Clans. Because Zymeth worked his way into favor with the Serpent Clan's Lord Oja, he found himself in a position to bend the Serpents' will to his own, and he was able to wipe out nearly the entire clan after tricking them into constructing ships that would have supposedly taken them away from the isle they inhabit. These ships were cursed to drain the life from their passengers, and upon discovering Zymeth's treachery, Oja plunged the two clans into war. The Wolf Clan took this opportunity to rebel from their enslavement and struck up a war of their own. Zymeth's political power is equally matched by his magical prowess on the battlefield. Zymeth is more powerful than any Lotus master warlock, and while he has the ability to cast all sorts of magic, he seems to favor dabbling with the weather more than casting other types of spells. Zymeth doesn't carry any weapons, but he's able to summon storm clouds in an instant. His special attack causes it to rain in the surrounding environment, letting rice grow back at a faster rate and triggering his innate ability, which sends arcs of lightning toward nearby enemies during a downpour. For generations, Lord Zymeth has ruled the Lotus Clan as the undisputed first among equals. He is a master manipulator and orator, using deception and threats to build coalitions and cow opponents. In his dealings with other clans, Zymeth also uses his great longevity to powerful effect, planning schemes that span generations of Wolf and Serpent clansmen. No one could rule the Lotus without being a wizard as well as a statesman, and Zymeth is no exception. Like most of the warlock elite he is a specialist, and his sphere is weather, the sizzling crackle of lightning or the relentless force of a summer storm.Usage  Zymeth fears nothing as he's evil himself, walking on the battlefield and calling lightning upon his enemies. He intimidates them, meanwhile inspiring the Lotus clan's units. Anyone who dares to attack Zymeth with a melee weapon, shall receive devastating magic blasts of incredible force. Still, he prefers to shoot from afar. Zymeth usually stands still, regenerating his stamina to strike enemies with lightnings from above, those are very powerful and cover a wide area, which is why any enemy would prefer to stay away from Zymeth. Paired with his lover, Yvaine, Zymeth is able to perform a deadly combo: while enemies are trapped inside Yvaine's \"Ice Prison\", they will continuously get struck by Zymeth's lightnings.Serpent Orb  Zymeth uses the Serpent Orb stolen by the \u201cninja\u201d to free the Lotus of corruption. While using the Orb, he will become fearless, rampaging across the Dragon\u2019s skin. Zymeth has increased health, damage and even increased resistance of his major weaknesses.

This form is non-playable.Trivia Quotes (Move) Quotes (Attack) Quotes (When engaging in melee combat) Quotes (Kill) Quotes (Heal) Quotes (Death) Serpent Clan  The Serpent Clan is one of the four major clans of Battle Realms.Description  A derivative of the Dragon Clan, the Serpent Clan have forgotten their honorable ways and have resorted to thievery and deceit. Serpent clansmen are Yin followers. Unlike their Dragon ancestors, they do not scorn the use of firearms; instead they have learned to employ its use in many of their fighting arts. Even though the Dragon Clan knew how to use gunpowder, it was the Serpent Clan which uncovered its secrets.History  The Serpent Clan was forged out of those of the Dragon Clan who fled south to escape the ravages of the Horde. Since then, for four generations the Serpent Clan has dominated through force and cunning, until the death of Lord Oja and the treachery of the Lotus Clan created a dangerous struggle for power among the three Clans on the island. Like their totem, the Serpent Clan knows the value of a stealthy approach and a sudden, lethal strike. Their soldiers tend to be tricksters and thieves as well as deadly fighters, skilled in techniques to baffle mounted pursuit and lure opponents into ambush. The Serpent Clan also possesses the secrets of gunpowder, and has adapted it to many offensive purposes; indeed, while the Dragon Clan may have been the ones to first discover the power of gunpowder, it is the Serpent that mastered the use of it. While the Dragon clan followed the ways of Yang, the Serpent has turned to the ways of Yin, as a result of abandoning their honorable ways in favour of easy paths to power. In addition, the Serpent clan lost faith in the Dragon Deity of their parent clan; they laugh at the notion that a great divine being watches over them, for they remember how the Horde swept through the lands and killed all it came across, regardless of faith. Now the Serpent rules through strength and fear, knowing that other clans are waiting to take over should they show weakness. Unfettered by high-flown morals, all ways are open to them. Kenji's Journey: Kenji may restore the Serpent Clan to dominance, if he chooses to rule through strength and pragmatic cunning rather than the conventions of honor. If Kenji proves to be his father's true son, he can re-forge the stability that is now in doubt, and the Serpent may rule again.Serpent Units  TIER 1 TIER 2 TIER 3 NON-TIERSerpent Structures  Clan-specific Structures Common StructuresZen Masters  Zen Masters take on the role of heroes in the land of Battle Realms.

By consensus, Lord Koril is also believed to be the second most powerful warlock of the Lotus Clan, both magically and politically. It is also rumored that he is by far the eldest of any of them, older than Zymeth himself. To have survived so long in the Byzantine, the deadly world of the Lotus, bespeaks a brilliant mind and ruthless political instincts. He does not lead openly, but is always present at critical debates. Koril is both a master warlock and a skilled fighter. On the battlefield, he wields a scythe that can cut people down as easily as it can reap wheat. However, Koril's fighting prowess stems from his unique magical ability to fold the \"fabric\" of space. An old report from a Serpent Clan archer who saw Koril in combat said that the Lotus mage seemed to be shimmering like a quivering bowstring while fighting. Supposedly, Koril made quick work of two other Serpent Clan warriors before the archer took aim and loosed an arrow directly at Koril, only to have it strike the tree directly behind him as if the arrow passed right through him. The Lotus mage then performed a strange hand gesture, and the archer instantly found himself standing on a road a half mile away from the fighting. Koril is formally styled \"Master of the College of Space,\" and pursues a species of magic distinct from but related to the Forbidden Path. Position and distance are no great trouble to him, and he is often seen at opposite ends of the land in a single day. His power is such that he seems to shimmer at all times, a trait infuriating to enemy archers.Usage  As Koril is often on his own, he pursues his own goals on the battlefield. He is more of a swift assassin, than a competent warrior. He is excellent at confusing enemy rangers on watchtowers; Because of his gravity distortion, he is almost never hit by any projectiles, thus other Lotus' units remain safe. This can also be much of assistance when the Lotus is allied with other clans, Koril may distract watchtowers while other clans' demolishers will take them down. The principal goal of Koril is to heavily confuse and annoy enemies. His teleportability allows him to invade enemy ricefields to kill peasants and sabotage the economy of the Lotus' enemies and acquire more Yin power. He may also teleport right into enemy positions, distracting enemy units and serving as a signal for the other Lotus' units to attack. Though Koril and Issyl despise each other, they're an excellent duo, when in comes to battles. Issyl's haste makes Koril swifter than he already is. It is a great combination to murder enemy peasants in the shortest time.Trivia Quotes (Move) Quotes (Attack) Quotes (Kill) Quotes (Heal) Shinja  Shinja is a Zen Master of the Serpent Clan, and serves as the its leader unless Kenji chooses to take control of the clan.Background  The leader of the Serpent Clan is by all accounts a coldhearted but efficient warrior. He was the captain of Lord Oja's Serpent Guard at the time of Oja's murder, presumably at the hands of his son, Kenji. While the proof was circumstantial, Kenji instantly fled the Serpent Clan and remained exiled for seven years. It was Shinja and his men who sent search parties into the woods in hopes of capturing Kenji. In the years following Oja's death, Shinja rose to take over control of the Serpent Clan. But Shinja wasn't known for being cruel; he was merely indifferent. One account of this indifference to life came from one of his ex-bodyguards who, at the time, was part of a group that was sent after a ragtag band of bandits, who became the inadvertent kidnappers of a Serpent daimyo's daughter when one of their heists went wrong. While his group was outnumbered three to one in unfamiliar territory, Shinja never showed any hesitation when confronting the kidnappers, and at the same time, he didn't bask in the confidence of his men's skill. He knew that the bandits were nothing more than a bunch of farmers with no formal weapons training whatsoever, and yet, he also knew that an example had to be made out of them. Without even batting an eye, Shinja issued his men a single command, and within minutes, the entire group of bandits had been cut to ribbons. Shinja himself participated in the slaughter (lest his men lose confidence in his leadership) and showed no pleasure in his action. Nor did he seem to feel any guilt. Were it not for the fierce personal loyalty his rival Otomo inspires, Shinja surely would rule the entire land with his brand of pragmatic justice and ruthless efficiency. No one loves Lord Shinja, but none can deny that he keeps order and has helped preserve the Serpent Clan in difficult times. In person Shinja is an undeniable force, charismatic, coldly intelligent and utterly without fear. No one has ever crossed him and lived to tell of it, beyond a babbled confession in a chamber deep beneath Serpentholm. He despises talk of the old Dragon clan, and considers honor to be a sadly obsolete concept. In all things he is a realist, and magical attacks have been known to quail and dissipate under his skeptical gaze and indomitable will.Kenji's Journey  Shinja rules the Serpent clan under an iron grip as he lead a bandit army to suppress the peasant rebellion under Otomo's command. With Kenji's return, Kenji will try to sought Shinja's loyalties with Otomo's aid. Shinja's fate is decided as to whether Kenji will either recreate the Dragon Clan or restore the Serpent Clan.Path of the Dragon  Shinja controls two provinces in the lowlands at the time of Lord Oja's death as he resisted Kenji and Otomo but eventually defeated him and reluctantly submit his loyalty to Kenji. Kenji then questioned Shinja on the location of the Orb as he was supposed to protect it in which he replied it was in the Swan's Pool. Shinja then guided Kenji on its path to the Swan's Pool. While on the journey, he would later questioned Kenji on its search for the Orb. Upon reaching Serpentholm, they found out the Orb was stolen by a mysterious Ninja. Shinja become frustrated as he lost his faith to Kenji while the latter would focused on the Orb as well meeting with the Dragon and has no plans to reestablish the Serpent clan which he will restore it by himself. Otomo accompanies Shinja in wiping out either the Wolf or Lotus Clans, afterwards Shinja betrays Otomo and had him executed by crucifixion as well taking control of Serpentholm. He would later ally with the Lotus and sent them to delay Kenji as he returns from the Dragon's Spire in which he discovers Otomo's body crucified in which he gives Otomo a proper burial. Kenji immediately wipes out the Lotus vanguard then proceeds to Serpentholm where he defeats Shinja and his forces as well his Lotus allies and kills him, avenging Otomo's death.Path of the Serpent  Shinja maintains both provinces in the lowlands as Kenji attempts to sought his loyalty with Otomo's assistance. Upon defeating him, he loyally pleads his allegiance to him just as he faithfully served Lord Oja then questioned on the whereabouts of the Orb. Shinja later assisted Kenji in wiping out their enemies which made Otomo completely dismayed stating Kenji's actions as madness. While on Swan's pool, Shinja was instructed by Kenji to kill the Geisha due to the latter's obsession with the Orb. After taking control of Serpentholm and with the Orb stolen by the Ninja as well defeating the opposing clans, Shinja was sent by Kenji to the Dragon's Spire to pacify the villages as well to restore occupation in these areas. Upon reaching to the Dragon's Spire, he discovered that the villages were ruined and deserted as well littered with decaying corpses in which he and his forces battled living zombies and Spirit warriors as he tries to seek some answers behind this pestilence. Upon reaching the mountain top, he found out that the Necromancer is behind of infestation (making the master swordsman completely shocked) as the Necromancer offers his services to the Serpent Clan due to the Wolf's possession of the Orb (through his telepathy with the dead). Accompanied with his forces and the Necromancer as they departed from the Dragon's Spire, Shinja later discovers a rebel forces sent by Otomo to eliminate him. Shinja quickly dispatches the rebel army with the Necromancer's aid. Upon reaching to Serpentholm, he led his forces and the Necromancer in assisting Kenji in wiping out Otomo's forces and their Wolf allies but not long before Kenji kills Otomo, placing the latter's head hanging on the gates of Serpentholm. In the aftermath, Kenji and Shinja decides on acquiring the monk's or the ninja's aid. Upon hiring the Ninjas or the Monks, Kenji and Shinja witnessed the peace efforts conducted by Grayback and his Wolf entourage by sending an emissary to represent as the flag of truce but Kenji coldly responds by killing the Wolf emissary due to the Wolf Clan's cooperation with the ninja who killed his father. Shinja later participated in its final struggle against the Wolf Clan as well the Dark one which revealed its true form in which it sets the Horde on the loose as it attacks Kenji and his forces. After the Nightvol's demise, he quickly poised himself along with Kenji and the Necromancer as they prepared for a battle with the number of Hordelings swarming upon them.Trivia Quotes (Move) Quotes (Attack) Quotes (Kill) Quotes (Heal) Quotes (Death Grayback  Grayback is a Zen Master of the\u00a0Wolf Clan, and he is also the main leader of his clan, serving as its chief or \"lord.\"Overview  The Wolves were never truly a clan, at least not in the same organizational sense as the Serpent Clans. As such, they were easy victims for enslavement by the Lotus Clan to work in the shale mines in the mountainous regions of the island of Battle Realms. The Wolf Clan members were enslaved for generations, but their hope for freedom never diminished. This hope was largely kept alive by a worker known as Grayback, who organized his fellow Wolves through his hammer, mimicking the ancient drum language of the clan. He was the one who informed the Serpent Clan of the Lotus Clan's plans to eradicate them. Knowing that this would spark a war between the two factions, Grayback used that precise moment to revolt against his masters. His plan worked, and though the Wolf casualties were high, they soon became a free people with Grayback as their leader. The Wolf Clan's freedom wouldn't have been possible without Grayback's combat prowess. Grayback emerged from the mines covered with the blood of others and no fewer than four arrows protruding from his back and flank. In battle, he wields a massive mining pick that was built to tear solid stone to shreds-- picturing what it would do to people doesn't take a stretch of the imagination. When in battle, his lupine howl of rage and fury will inspire his allies to great feats of strength.Kenji's Journey (Serpent)  Grayback sends his forces to find the Orb, as Zymeth and Kenji also seeks for it, believing that the orb would be the key for them to go home. With the collapse of the Lotus Clan and the return of Kenji now assuming leadership of the Serpent Clan, a mysterious ninja offers the stolen Orb to the Wolf. At first, Grayback hesitates taking the Orb from the ninja, suspicious of his motives. Eventually the ninja succeeds in giving the Orb to them, and the Wolf Clan harnesses it in the hope that it will bring them home. Kenji attacks the Wolf in numerous battles, Grayback asked for a truce, but Kenji responded negatively, resuming his offensives in order to get the Orb and destroy the Clan, since the Wolf collaborated with the ninja who killed his father. In the final battle, Kenji defeats Grayback, but not long after, Nightvol and the Horde appears and attacks Kenji and his forces. In the end, as Nightvol and Kenji makes their final conversation, an injured Grayback climbs up a cliff and slashes Nightvol behind, killing Nightvol before he himself fell and presumably dies.Grayback's Journey  He started as Budo's slave in the shale mines. Along with a Sledger, they were tasked by Budo to harvest shale in the mines, promising extra rations for them. As they finished mining the first shale pile, Budo was approached by a Warlock, informing him of a feast and they need rice, which Budo agreed upon, leaving his promise unfulfilled. They were then again tasked to mine another shale pile. After finishing the task, a Master Warlock, appears, furious upon rotten rice Budo sent, the latter sent the last of the rations, leaving him hungry. He was again tasked to mine again, accidentally discovering the Skull of the White Wolf. As they approach the totem, Yvaine appears and commands them to follow her. Yvaine leaves them in the lower areas of the mines, trapping them with Shale Spiders. After they survive the attack, they approached a grieving Staff Adept, lamenting Grayback that he killed his \"babies\" and hinting that there are more Wolf slaves condemned to be eaten by the spiders, then quickly fleeing from Grayback. They then search the mines for more slaves, and rescues all of them, killing Lotus overseers and guards along the way, and also rescues Longtooth from spiders and defeating and wounding Yvaine herself in a duel. As they ascend to the surface, they meet both Serpent and Lotus guards and along the way, released and liberated several slaves. As they reach the entrance, Budo appears with some Wolf P easants. He fought them and they wounded him. Yvaine again appears, blocking the exit, separated from his brethren and Longtooth. He must find a way to the exit by venturing another exit and freeing slaves in the process. As they exit the mines, they deal with several Lotus guards and sends a Pitch Slinger on a Watchtower, signaling for Longtooth and his reinforcements.They approach a seemingly Wolf village when Wildeye fighting several Overseers.They beat them and builds an army to destroy the Lotus base nearby.

They follow the Forbidden Path, which focuses on death and decay. Their religion centralizes around three ancient brothers, now long gone, who tended the Tree of Corruption. The people of the Lotus are thin and pale in appearance, with generally little muscle or size to speak of. Bleached-white hair is universal; the Lotus clansmen bleach their hair as to frighten the more superstitious members of the Wolf Clan, as the barbaric Wolf clansmen associate pure white as a colour of divinity or great power, best represented in their reverence of their most valued artifact, the White Wolf's Skull. The length of a soldier's hair indicates his rank - the longer the better. Their armor is shiny and metallic, dark and silver in color, but flimsy and actually less effective than the Dragon clan's samurai armor or the Wolf clan's shale plates. Weapons are equally thin and flimsy, but often magically touched and able to strike multiple opponents at once. The Lotus clan's society has built its foundations on an odd religion that revolves around a nightmarish tree tended by three brothers. Each brother speaks for a different aspect of the tree - one brother the leaves, one the trunk, and one the blade that tends the tree's roots. The clan suffers from a universal problem. They are being consumed from within by their own corrupting magics. The corruption attaches itself to human life, but can be temporarily contained in other vessels (such as the staves of the Unclean). Even the master warlocks can only contain their corruption for so long. Indeed, the very attacks of the Lotus clan's second-tier units are attempts to expel the corruption temporarily, maintaining just enough balance to keep the units alive until they can attempt to contain the corruption with stronger magics. Physically weak but magically strong, alternately sycophantic and vengeful, the Lotus clan bows to the strong and rules the weak. Their ability to manipulate the superstitious Wolf clan has served them well. By raping the Wolf Clan's lands of all its best metals and minerals, the Lotus clan has become rich on the blood, sweat and tears of others.History  Like the Serpent, the Lotus Clan was formed from the remnants of an older clan devastated by the Horde. Long, long ago, there lived a peaceful tribe of wizards and foresters who worshiped the gods of balance and nature as symbolized by a great towering tree. They seldom knew trouble, or dissent, save when a group of overzealous scholars delved too deeply into certain dark magics of rot and corruption, together called the Forbidden Path. When the Horde came, all of that tribe died except for those few renegade wizards, whose knowledge of the Yin gave them a chance to flee as their brothers died. The wizards eventually reached the island of Battle Realms, and settled in the High Plateau, long known to be a place of strange energies. By that time they had formed themselves into a new clan, named for that intoxicating, perfumed blossom, the Lotus. Free of all restriction, the twisted members of the Lotus Clan pursue the Forbidden Path in earnest, seeking to master death and corruption by immersing themselves in it. Their beliefs are a rotten parody of those of their forefathers - their tree is an unnatural nightmare, tended by undead, undying brothers. Their contempt for the nature-worshipping Wolf Clan may well have deep roots in their own history. The leaders of this clan are ageless warlocks engaged in their own research, pursuing power-hungry machinations in their councils and shadowy alliances. Ethics are a mere joke to them; power and knowledge are their ideals, and the conquest of the other clans merely a means to that end. Decades spent manipulating and subjugating the Wolf and Serpent clans have left deep bad blood and tensions in the land.Lotus Units  TIER 1 TIER 2 TIER 3 TIER 4 NON-TIER UNITSLotus Structures  Clan-specific Structures Common StructuresLotus Zen Masters  Zen Masters take on the role of heroes in their respective clans, and Lotus Zen Masters are no different.

In appearance she resembles a normal geisha of great beauty, but she incarnates the dark side of their practices - she is a seductress, a poisoner, and possibly insane. Utara was the only child of a small family from an equally small farming village. Her traumatic upbringing began at the age of four, when a group of ruffians sacked her village, killing nearly everyone and burning the whole thing to the ground. For reasons unknown, Utara's life was spared that day. The bandits eventually dumped her off at the footsteps of a bathhouse, where she was taken in by a group of geishas. Through the years, Utara eventually forgot the horrifying incident and started to excel in the healing arts of the geishas. At the age of six, she had learned all the traditional dances of the geishas and had developed a stunning soprano voice. At the age of 11, she was assisting the bathhouse healer perform complicated spells, and by the time she was 15, she was easily the most proficient healer among her group of geishas. One night, however, a group of Lord Shinja's hired raiders arrived at the bathhouse and started boasting about their \"discipline\" of some local peasants. Most of the men had minor wounds, which Utara and a few other geishas attended to. As the night wore on, all the geishas except for Utara had retired to their quarters. It was at this point that something within Utara had resurfaced, something that she had buried deep within her many years ago. Some of the geishas awoke to Utara's high-pitched singing to find that the raiders were convulsing and dying - some simply shriveling away to dust - before their very eyes. When her singing had perished the last of the raiders, Utara thanked the geishas for their years of hospitality and disappeared into the night. Utara paints her face with a deathly white color and wears long, sharp gloves that give off the illusion that her hands are branches. Attached to one of her forearms is a thin blade that she uses to deadly effect, rapidly slicing and riposting her enemies. Indeed, her proficience with the weapon is so great that any melee attack made on Utara comes with a price; for unless the blow slays Utara, she will immediately counter-attack, making sure that anyone that harms her will be harmed by her in turn. Utara is, without a doubt, one of the strangest (and deadliest) weapons in the Serpent Clan's arsenal.Trivia Quotes (Move) Quotes (Attack) Quotes (When engaging in melee combat) Quotes (Kill) Quotes (Healed) Arah  Arah is a Zen Master of the Dragon Clan.Background  While she might appear somewhat frail, Arah is stronger than most men. During a run-in with a Wolf Clan patrol, Arah was seen doing battle with two massive black bears. She injured one of the bears enough to cause it to retreat, but, to the Wolf Clan's surprise, she felled the second bear with a precision arrow shot through its eye. Upon moving in to question Arah, who at the time was trespassing on Wolf Clan territory, the Wolf Clan patrol instantly learned to respect and fear her almost superhuman archery skills. From atop a tree, she managed to fire an arrow through the armor plates of one of the Wolf members. A similar shot a few seconds later proved that the first wasn't based on luck. In the end, it took the better part of a day for the Wolf patrol to flush Arah from the tree and subdue her. Arah is an archer without peer, and her skills overshadow even the Dragon Clan archers of old - her arrows move with a speed, accuracy, and force that terrify her foes. She carries a massive longbow that requires more than 120 pounds of draw strength to use. Flying from the oversized longbow, her arrows punch through armor and bone like stabbing spears. She traveled to this land from elsewhere, having met Kenji during his long exile. Somewhere in their shared past is a bond that links them, a blood debt or point of honor that led her to follow him home. A tall, slender woman, her manner is distant and cold, but for now she fights for the Dragon with all her heart and soul.Trivia Quotes (Move) Quotes (Attack) Quotes (Kill) Quotes (Heal) Quotes (Death) Soban  Soban is a Zen Master of the Lotus Clan.Overview  Like all the highest-level Lotus warlocks, Soban's researches have taken him on a unique path. His work blends clockwork and high wizardry to produce alchemical feats like his tireless servants, the golems. He is called \"Lord\" as a courtesy for his accomplishments but he holds no political sway, having always kept out of power struggles of the Lotus elite. Soban isn't like the other Lotus Clan warlocks. While he studied the forbidden black magic that seems to consume all the members of that clan, he eventually shunned it, preferring instead to focus on his studies of the earth sciences. Like the other Lotus heroes, Soban is old, and he himself remembers a time when the clan hadn't yet discovered the forbidden arts. At that time, Soban was a tinkerer, and he spent a lot of his time fashioning lifeless materials like metal and stone into toys and lifelike objects. When his colleagues began practicing the arcane magic that's now so prevalent in the Lotus society, Soban took his work one step further--he started to create life out of lifeless rocks. He ultimately unlocked the secret of golem creation. Behind his back, Soban's colleagues deride him as a mere tinkerer or mechanic, but his powers are genuine. The Wolf Clan's Shale Lord is a result of one of his experiments gone wrong. In battle, Soban carries a claw engine, another one of his creations. This three-pronged weapon is attached to his forearm and gives him an improved striking ability.Trivia Quotes (Move) Quotes (Attack) Quotes ( Combat) Quotes (Kill) Quotes (Heal) Otomo  Otomo is a Zen Master of the Dragon Clan.Background  When\u00a0Taro, last royal son of Tarrant's line died, it fell to his chief ministers to keep order in the land - of these, the most beloved by the people was Otomo. Where Shinja ruled through strength and fear, Otomo inspired loyalty and bravery in his followers through fairness, wisdom and honorable behavior. Lord Otomo was one of the ruling members of the Serpent Clan during Kenji's disappearance. Unlike Oja, however, Otomo believed in the higher standards that were prevalent during the days of Tarrant's rule. While he was technically a bureaucrat, Otomo wasn't some fat administrator. And while he had noble blood coursing through his veins, and even though he appeared right at home in formal occasions, Otomo was a man who was more comfortable on the field of battle. He was a general, after all, and his riding and fencing skills were second to none. Otomo carries a massive nodachi, a Japanese long sword, which he uses to cut down any enemies that stray too close to ribbons. His enemies deride him as weak and soft, but anyone who had faced him in battle knows the opposite - his very presence seems to put strength into his allies. In him, it is whispered, something of the old Dragon Clan survives.Kenji's Journey  Otomo leads an army of peasants challenging Shinja's authority over the Serpent Clan, and seeks to restore order. With Kenji's return, Otomo pleads his loyalties to him, after falsely believing he had passed away. Otomo's fate is decided as to whether Kenji will either recreate the Dragon Clan or restore the Serpent Clan.Path of the Dragon  Otomo assists Kenji in recapturing two provinces held by Shinja, and defeats Shinja in battle. Afterwards, Shinja decides to plead his loyalties with Kenji, though later on Shinja would question Kenji's actions and his search for the Orb. When they journey towards Serpentholm, Kenji tells Otomo that the Dragon\u00a0is telling them to hurry, they proceeded to Serpentholm, only to discover the Orb has been stolen. Kenji decides to continue on to the Dragon's Spire, Otomo wanted to go to but Kenji told him to stay and assist Shinja, who by then has lost faith in Kenji, who was to focused on the Orb and had no intentions of restoring the Serpent Clan, and decides to rule the Serpent Clan by himself. Otomo assists Shinja in pushing back either Wolf or Lotus Clans. Afterwards Shinja betrays Otomo, but not before he warns Shinja that Kenji will kill him soon, and he was executed by crucifixion. Kenji will discover this by his return, and gives Otomo a proper burial. He will then avenge Otomo's death and kill Shinja and destroy his ambitions.Path of the Serpent  Otomo assists Kenji in gaining Shinja's loyalties. As they deal with their enemies and burn down towns, Otomo questions Kenji's actions as madness, dismayed by how Kenji was ruthless in harming his people, of how he had towns burned, and the geishas executed at Swan's Pool. The last straw came after taking Serpentholm, when Kenji orders him to \"pacify\" those who resist. Tired of killing more lives and listening to Kenji, Otomo refused and decided to help them instead. He sent forces to get rid of Shinja as he returns from the Dragon's Spire, then allies with the Wolf to get rid of the \"false Serpent\" Kenji from power. Kenji is informed of the conspiracy from a dying rider and reorganizes his forces at Serpentholm, suffering heavy losses as Otomo's forces and their Wolf allies outnumbered Kenji's forces. With Shinja's arrival and aid, Kenji defeats Otomo and his forces and kills him, having his head hanging on the gates of Serpentholm.Trivia  \u014ctomo is a surname meaning \"Great Friend\" (kanji: \u5927\u53cb). According to Battle Realms.dat, Otomo has another scrapped BG - Demoralize, which supposedly would decrease enemies' attack power & become Shinja's Intimidation.Quotes (Move) Quotes (Attack) Quotes (Kill) Quotes (Heal) Quotes (Death) Wolf Clan  The Wolf Clan is one of the four major clans of Battle Realms.Description  Of all the clans, the Wolf are the most attuned to nature; it is the focus of their religion, and even their homes, tools and weapons are fashioned from raw stone and uncarved wood. Their culture revolves around a game called Wolfball, roughly a cross between rugby and baseball, that trains them for war, keeps them strong and fierce, and embodies their sense of life. Their religion and magic are druidic - they worship the power of nature, and draw on it to inspire their fighters and frustrate their foes. With their rough-hewn ways and druidical religion, the Wolf Clan make odd neighbors for the pragmatic, civilized Serpents. Local Serpent villagers shiver to hear animalistic howls and wild drumming from the Wolf settlements. Visitors speak of their primitive-seeming architecture, and the warlike game of Wolfball, easily mistaken for a controlled civil war- no one without the Wolf Clan's gift for swift regeneration should attempt it. And there are stranger things glimpsed in the woods, half-man and half-animal... Many mysteries still surround them, from the rules (if any) of Wolfball to the rites their women practice in the full of the moon. The trauma of the war with the Lotus left deep marks on the Wolf Clan, such as new fighting styles built around bare hands, rocks, and mining implements. Through it all, their basic culture seems to have survived: a delight in nature, harmony with the seasons, and a natural wisdom rooted in balance. Alone among the Clans, the Wolf Clan does not seek to control or conquer its enemies - their only goal is to return home, to where they belong. To this end, they hope to recapture the Serpent's Orb, the ancient artifact by which the land was broken, and use its magic to return them to their island home.Background  The Wolf Clan had their humble beginnings in their ancient homeland island. The Wolf Clan were a peaceful people, living off the land while tending and respecting it as it had provided them shelter and food for centuries. The Wolf Clan knew little magic and what little they did know were used by their Druidess Order. The Druidess Order were renowned for their medicinal herbs and their control over nature. The Wolf Clan revered a Guardian Deity, known only as the White Wolf, and communed with their deity through a totem known as \"The Skull of The White Wolf\". Life was good for the Wolf Clan. This age of peace that lasted for generations finally ended when the world was shattered by the Serpent's Orb used by Tarrant The Elder to protect his own clan from the ravenous Horde. The impact of the Dragon Spirit's clash with the Horde sent shockwaves for hundreds of miles and disrupted weather patterns worldwide. Huge waves rose from the sea and quickly drowned the humble island of the Wolf Clan. Rain unlike anyone had ever seen before fell from the sky endlessly and lighting crashed and struck the homes of the Wolf Clan, shattering their simple dwellings of stone and wood to splinters. Even their own formidable druidic magic were useless to the Druidess Order during this sudden destructive calamity. Some Wolf clansmen abandoned their home to risk their lives on the sea in primitive, wooden rafts, while others clung to their island home and sought protection from the storm from their ancient priestesses, the wise Druidesses. Desperate, the Druidess Order pleaded with the Wolf Clan's deity to save them from this terror. The Wolf Clan's guardian spirit answered their cry and with a blinding flash, the entire Wolf Clan vanished. The Wolf Clan reappeared in a strange and fertile land, unknown to them that this was the land where the Serpent Empire was founded. Thankful for being saved, the Wolf Clansmen rejoiced and together built a new home, soon joined by the survivors of their clan who had taken to the sea on the rafts, re-uniting families and friends. Exploring their new home, the rough Wolf clansmen met with the civilized Serpent Clan; though their customs were wildly different, an agreement of peace was struck. But it was not to last... The Lotus Clan, already a manipulative ally of the Serpent Clan, made a deal with the Serpent Clan; to look the other way in the days to come. The Serpent Clan agreed, having never truly trusted the Wolf Clan. To the Serpent, they were too different; too uncivilized. Too savage. The Serpent armies did not clash with the forces of the Lotus that day. Soon after, the armies of the Lotus Clan swept forth and ravaged the villages of the Wolf Clan. It would take many months, but the Lotus took advantage of the Wolf Clan's superstition and simple nature, cowing the Clan into submission by universally bleaching their hair, fooling many of the Wolf into believing the Lotus were harbingers of the White Wolf. When the deception was finally revealed, it was too late. Betrayed of their trust, the Wolf Clan was subjugated and secretly vowed an oath of revenge against both the Serpent Clan and the Lotus Clan. As fate would have it, a few remmants of the Wolf Clan, composed mainly of the Druidess Order, escaped the wrath of the Lotus army and hid themselves within the safety of the swamplands unknowingly to their subjugators. However, the majority of their Clan were still chained and imprisoned in the Eastern Shale Mines of the Lotus Clan, becoming slaves and servants, forced to mine shale and other metals for their arrogant and cruel jailers. For a generation this continued, until a young and wise clansman named Grayback, descended from a long line of Wolf chieftains, rose into leadership and planned a massive rebellion, using the Clan's newfound hammers and pickaxes to invent a form of morse code in the deep mines. In secret, the Wolf Clan trained and practiced new forms of combat, waiting for the fateful day when their bloodlust would be sated. Then at last, the call was issued, and Grayback led a vicious rebellion against their Lotus masters. The Wolf Clan struck as one, and through blood, sweat and tears, the Wolf Clan reclaimed its freedom. Free of their shackles, the Wolf clan travelled to the North-Western mountains once more and rebuilt their home in the caves, crags and valleys, wishing only to live in peace with nature, free from the treacherous Serpent and the cruel Lotus.Trivia  The Wolf clan might've been inspired by the real-life Ainu, indigenous bear-worshippers in Northern Japan whose ancestry traces back to Okhotsk people and Jomon people, who arrived before Yayoi ancestors of Japanese, inspiration for Dragon & Serpent clans.Wolf Units  TIER 1 TIER 2 TIER 3 NON-TIER UNITSWolf Structures  Clan-specific Structures Common StructuresZen Masters  Zen Masters take on the role of heroes in the world of Battle Realms. The are summoned through the keep and by Yin/Yang. Below are the Zen Masters of the Wolf clan.Shale Lord  The Shale Lord is a Zen Master of the Wolf Clan.Background  Among most members of the Wolf Clan, it is believed that this walking stone beast was actually once one of their kind, a Wolf named Hightongue for his eloquent speeches and sharp insults. Hightongue was around before the enslavement wars between the Wolf and Serpent/Lotus Clans, and he was often the most outspoken and vocal slave of them all. He became notorious among the Serpent and Lotus Clan enslavers for causing too much trouble and was thus \"given\" to a Lotus Clan magician called Soban, who experimented on him in an attempt to create the perfect miner. Soban's experiments on Hightongue are rumoured to have left him with skin of stone. Hightongue was never seen again after the night of Soban's experiment, but the stone-skinned creature would often be seen by Wolf slaves wandering the mines at night. The creature was soon given the name \"Shale Lord\" by the Wolf community. During the Wolf Clan revolt, the Shale Lord appeared and assisted the Wolves in fighting off the Serpent and Lotus armies, but since that night, sightings of the Shale Lord have been sporadic. While there's no actual evidence to link the Shale Lord to Hightongue, it's believed that they are indeed one and the same. These days, the Shale Lord is a symbol of the Wolf Clan's enslavement, a failed magical experiment, a lonely outcast, a military asset. Ever since he escaped captivity he roamed the wilderness for years - a strange stone man, faceless, voiceless, alone. In battle there is no more terrifying opponent. Naturally armored and hugely strong, he fights with his macelike fists. No one hates the Lotus Clan more, and his rage seems to increase his strength even as he battles.Trivia Quotes Yvaine  Yvaine is a Zen Master for the Lotus Clan, available in the Winter of the Wolf expansion pack for Battle Realms, and also serves as the expansion's main antagonist.About  The ice queen's heart is as cold as the crystalline magic she weaves. Dressed in a long, black dress with spider-like arms protruding from the back. Not much is know about Yvaine and where she came from or how she got her alignment with the Lotus Clan.This cold-hearted hissing old hag oversees the day-to-day operations of the shale mines, and she resents that fact every waking hour. She longs to be more than just a babysitter for the Wolf Clan slaves, and she takes out her resentment and hatred on her subjects. Highly skilled in the arcane arts particularly in ice magic, Yvaine attacks with waves of frost that penetrate her enemies deep into the bone, gripping them in a cold embrace. From a distance, she'll conjure and hurl shards slender lances of ice that travel through the air and shatter into sharp fragments that stabs its victims. Yvaine is a desperate, merciless, and a very crafty sorceress who would stop at nothing until all of her enemies tasted the cold embrace of death it self.White Wolf Totem's Power  Yvaine used this form during the last mission in Grayback's Journey. Yvaine uses the White Wolf Totem, the sacred treasure of the wolf, to make her invulnerable to everything.Trivia Quotes (Move) Quotes (Attack) Quotes(When engaging in melee combat) Quotes (Kills) Quotes (Heal) Quotes (Death) Vetkin  Vetkin is a Zen Master of the Serpent Clan.Background  Opinions about Vetkin, Lord Garrin's chief aide, fall into two camps; some say he is a useless wastrel who lazes around the keep, flirting with chambermaids and admiring his tattoos in the mirror. Others claim he's the cleverest man in the province, controlling all the accounts and makes himself wealthy while Lord Garrin is busy in the field. Vetkin is a young slender man blessed with good looks, quick on his feet and well-trained in the twin sai he carries. He never seems to lift a finger, but each year he wins the Harvest-day foot-race. Rumors of a dark past never seem to touch him - a wink and a ready smile always seem to banish any doubts about his loyalty. Vetkin's true tale is one of riches to rags, and then back to riches again. He was born the youngest son of a noble, and after all his elder brothers had been married off and been given their share of the estate, Vetkin was left with nothing. So at the age of 14, he left home and traveled north, taking with him only a sword, a blanket, and the clothes on his back. He spent his first few years on the road stealing horses and sacks of grain and then selling them back at an inflated price during times of shortage. His exploits soon caught the attention of the Night Brothers, a local thieves' guild, which eventually kidnapped Vetkin and forced him to take a six-hour initiation. Naturally, Vetkin passed the test and was soon inducted into their ranks. While the Night Brothers helped forge his skills as a thief, they also reintroduced Vetkin to the ways of nobility so that he may one day live a better life than the one that fate had dealt him. Soon, Vetkin was taken in by Lord Garrin, where he now lives a happy life managing his accounts and settling his disputes, the latter of which he does with his trusty sai.Trivia Quotes (Move) Quotes (Attack) Quotes (Kills) Quotes (Heal) Lotus Brothers  The Three Brothers are Zen Masters of the Lotus Clan.About  The Three Brothers: Lythis, Sekh and Tausil are those who once tended the Tree of Corruption. Each of the Brothers spoke for different aspects of the Tree - one the leaves, one the trunk, and one the roots. Although long dead, their spirits still continue to serve the Lotus Clan until now. The Brothers' spirits lie in deep sleep at the Crypt of the Brothers, where at the cost of Yin points any of the chosen Brothers can be awakened to guide the clan. Although their spectral form doesn't provide them with much power, their attacks can drain the willpower of their enemies at such a rate that the Warlock's Soul Lick can never compare to. The drained willpower is then converted into the Brother's stamina to be expended as Battle Gear for the clan.Battle Gear  Dark Powers: Expend stamina to give a Lotus Unit a blessing, in the form of Battlegear. All three Brothers give the same blessing to all Lotus units, with the exception of the Warlock and Master Warlock.Trivia Quotes (Move) Quotes (Attack) References Clans Overview  There are four major clans that comprise the population of Battle Realms Island. Each with unique characteristics, units, cultures and histories, the decision of which is best is up to you. Within the borders of this broken land, three clans maintain an uneasy coexistence, fraught with tension and, at times, slavery and open war. The Wolf Clan in the northwest, the Lotus Clan high on their northern plateau, and the Serpent Clan in the fertile lowlands. And always, at least in some minds, there is a ghost of a fourth great clan, the lost Dragon Clan, forefathers of the Serpent. Despite their proximity, no three persons could be more different. As yet there is no clear victor in this three-handed struggle; alliances and enmities are unstable, and you never know who or what might be massing on your borders. If you are to survive in this world, you must study your enemies and your friends alike: know their ways, their warriors, and their weaknesses.The Dragon Clan  Those of the Dragon live and die by sacred ancient martial codes and philosophy and believe that power is worthless without wisdom and discipline to guide it. They live according to feudal traditions, each member of the clan fulfilling his role, for excellence and balance in life, and this philosophy permeates their lives. Lord Oja, the Serpent Clan leader, was assassinated by unknown forces seven years ago. His first son is dead, and his second, Kenji Oja, the \"Little Dragon,\" fled the country. Battle realms begins with his return, and he must decide what path he is to walk as he takes control of his father's people. The beliefs of the Dragon Clan are expressed most perfectly in their fighting units - their swordsmen, archers, and geisha healers embody the Dragon traditions of bravery and wisdom. In Kenji's hands, this clan is like a perfectly balanced sword, a tool that may bring order and peace back to a land torn by civil war.The Serpent Clan  The Serpent Clan was forged out of those who fled south to escape the ravages of the Horde. Since then, for four generations the Serpent Clan has dominated through force and cunning, until the death of Lord Oja, and the treachery of the Lotus Clan created a dangerous struggle for power among the three Clans on the Island. Like their Totem, the Serpent Clan knows the value of a stealthy approach and a sudden, lethal strike. The soldiers tend to be tricksters and thieves as well as deadly fighters, skilled in techniques to baffle mounted pursuit and lure opponents into ambush. The Serpent Clan also possesses the secret of gunpowder, and has adapted it to many of their offensive purposes. The Serpent rules through strength and fear, knowing that other clans are waiting to take over should they show weakness. Kenji may restore the Serpent Clan to dominance, if he chooses to rule through strength and pragmatic cunnning rather than the conventions of honor. If Kenji proves to be his father's true son, he can re-forge the stability that is now in doubt, and the Serpent may rule again. Unfettered by high-flown morals, all ways are open to them.The Wolf Clan  The Wolf Clan lives closer to nature than the other clans; they are as fierce as their namesake, and at times seem primitive and superstitious. The Wolf Clan were early arrivals on the Island, when long ago their island was flooded in climatic disruptions that followed the breaking of the continent. When they went out to sea the currents in the channel drove them on to the shores of the Serpent Clan's land. There they settled in a high, craggy region, isolated, until the Lotus Clan arrived and enslaved them after a long, bloody struggle. As shown in Grayback's flashback, the Wolf Clan was said to be brought into the Serpent Clan's Island by their Druidess' Order with the use of the relic of their Clan's totem, The Skull of the White Wolf, in order to be saved from the climatic disasters they were experiencing. When they arrived at the Island they had a truce with the other two clans that were already there, the Serpent and the Lotus. Soon everything was peaceful again for the Wolf Clan, but it was not to last. Not soon after the Wolf Clan had settled in its new home, the Lotus attacked their villages with the lead of Lord Zymeth and after a brutal war, they were enslaved, and forced to work in the Lotus' shale mines. Wolf Clan tribesmen are brutally strong, and the Lotus used them as laborers to mine their own land for metal and minerals. This still shows in their fighting style - long denied weapons, they adapted mining tools into combat equipment. Spikes and clubs used to shatter stone were repurposed to deadly effect when they won a vicious war of liberation led by a former miner named Grayback. Of all the clans, the Wolf are the most attuned to nature; it is the focus of their religion, and even their homes, tools and weapons are fashioned from raw stone, bone and uncarved wood. Their culture revolves around a game called Wolfball, a very rough cross between rugby and baseball (except with wolves running about and a metal ball the size of a man's head), that trains them for war, keeps them strong and fierce, and embodies their sense of life. Their religion and magic are druidic - they worship the power of nature, and draw on it to inspire their fighters and frustrate their foes. Alone among the clans, the Wolf Clan does not seek to control or conquer its enemies - their only goal is to return home, and to survive. To this end, they hope to recapture the Serpent Orb, the ancient artifact by which the land was broken, and use its magic to return them to their own land, since their fabled relic the \"Skull of the White Wolf\" was destroyed in a battle between Grayback and Yvaine.The Lotus Clan  Those belonging to the Lotus are exiles from their own people - a sect of wizards that were banished from their homeland and parent clan for breaking clan law and pushing the Forsaken Path (Forbidden Path). Their people are thin and pale, bleached-white hair is universal. The length of a soldier's hair indicates his rank - the longer the better (though it may not be right all the time, with exceptions like Soban). Their armor is shiny and metallic, gold and silver in color, but flimsy and actually less effective than the Dragon Clan's Samurai Warrior or the Wolf Clan's Shale Plates. Weapons are equally thin and flimsy, but often magically touched and able to strike multiple opponents at once. The Lotus Clan's society has built its foundations on an odd religion that revolves around a tree tended by three Brothers. Each brother speaks for a different aspect of the tree - one brother who prunes the leaves, another that tends the trunk, and the last wields the blade that tends the tree's roots. The clan has a problem, they are being consumed from within by their corrupting magics. The corruption attaches itself to human life, but can be temporarily contained in other vessels (such as single-staffs of the Unclean). Even the Master Warlocs can only contain their corruption for so long. If the Lotus had discovered the problem early enough, they could have returned to their people for help, but now it is too late. The attacks of the Lotus Clan's second-tier units are attempts to expel the Corruption temporarily, maintaining just enough balance to keep the units alive until they can contain the corruption with stronger magics. Physically weak but magically strong, alternately sycophantic and vengeful, the Lotus Clan bows to the strong and rules the weak. Their ability to manipulate the superstitious Wolf Clan has served them well. By raking the Wolf Clan's lands of all its best metals and minerals, the Lotus Clan has become rich on the blood, sweat and tears of others.Gaihla  Gaihla is a Zen Master of the Wolf Clan.Overview  Not much is known about Gaihla. She dwells in the deepest, oldest woodlands, and according to the tales she is a solitary druidess or forest goddess, or something in-between. Hundreds of years old, she has been known to disappear for decades and live out the time as a giant oak tree. All forests and growing things are under her protection. Stories about Gaihla have been surfacing among Serpent Clan members since the day the Wolf Clan arrived on the island of Battle Realms. Reports make her out to be a druidess and state that wherever she appears, strange occurrences always follow. For instance, one such report claims that a farmer saw a slender woman, believed to be Gaihla, standing in his rice paddy. Later that spring, the farmer had the most bountiful crop ever. Other reports from hunters claim that a woman somehow made the forest around them move, causing them to lose their prey. Not all reports of Gaihla's appearances are as harmless, however. Some Serpent settlers claim to have been warned by the same mysterious woman not to tear down the forest for the purpose of building homes. Often when these warnings went unheeded, some settlers' bodies would be found gouged in a hundred places, or worse, entire villages would simply disappear as if they never existed. The Serpent Clan regularly sent raiding parties out into the woods to try to hunt down Gaihla; most never returned from their expeditions. During one such raid, however, Gaihla was pursued deep into the forest, where she was confronted by one of the Serpent Clan's warlocks. While even the warlock wasn't a match for Gaihla, she lost control of her own powers during the confrontation, and witnesses claimed that Gaihla transformed into a massive tree. Whether that tall tale is true or not, reports of Gaihla sightings have all but ceased since that day... Despite her allegiance to life, she can be a vicious fighter, wielding a wreath of thorns in battle\u00a0 against those who would threaten the forests. Her relationship with plant life is mysterious - she moves unimpeded through the densest undergrowth, and any crops thrive in her very presence.Journeys  Gaihla can be recruited in the original Battle Reams campaign, provided the player has chosen to side with the Dragon Clan. In the relevant mission, a group of Wolf Pitch Slingers will be burning forests to help with their mining projects; as they burn the trees however, they are also causing Gaihla great pain. After Otomo and Shinja has dealt with the Pitch Slingers, Gaihla curses the miners and joins forces with the Dragon Clan, promising that the miners will \"pay for their recklessness\". As long as Gaihla is kept alive throughout the mission she will be available for future missions by summoning her from the Keep. Gaihla also appears in Grayback's Journey as a major character in assisting on his journey. In one mission, she rests up in Tao's monastery temporarily. After the mission is finished, she was recovered and continue along with Grayback and the Wolves.Usage  Gaihla is a good tank against Piercing, Blunt and Magic damage types. She can sustain hard hits from the enemy watchtowers, while the demolition units will be taking those down. It's important to note that Gaihla is unique (because of the instant area- of- effect healing) and the only healer in the Wolf Clan, meaning the top prioritiy should be usage of her Battle Gear. That being said, Gaihla is best left idle, always recovering stamina and healing allies. Gaihla is still a weak fighter, so it's wise to keep her away from the enemies, but she can still assist her allies by running in the middle of a fight and using her battle gear, to then run back to a safe place (like forests that don't reduce her eyesight due to one of her innate abilities). The \"Herbalist\" 4 Yang technique (ugprade) from the Vitality Garden will benefit Gaihla greatly, boosting her already high health regeneration. Gaihla can be put near the rice fields to make rice grow much faster (one of the innate abilities). After she throws the flowers around, the rice grows back at a very fast rate, quicker than if you would water it.Trivia Quotes (Move) Quotes (Attack) Quotes (Healed) Issyl  Issyl is a Zen Master of the Lotus Clan.About  Visitors to the court of the Lotus Clan will nervously wonder why a twelve-year-old child sits on their high council, clutching an oversized hourglass. They don't feel any better when they learn that this is Lord Issyl, Dean of the College of Time, one of the most powerful wizards in the world. When they realize that eyes hundreds of years old peer from the face of a nasty little boy, nausea is a common reaction. Among all the Lotus Clan heroes, Issyl's age is the biggest mystery of them all. Outwardly, he looks like a twelve-year-old child, but his eyes reflect the wisdom of a -very- old man. In reality, Issyl is a skilled magician whose condition is the result of an experiment gone wrong. Nearly seventy years ago, Issyl was in his tower attempting to master the flow of time. Nobody knows what happened that night, but his servants heard a thunderous sound emit from the top of the tower, and they claim that their lord Issyl has been slowly aging backward ever since. Despite this misfortune, his body is free from the rampant decay that plagues many who follow the Path. Time flows\u2026 interestingly\u2026 around him, and he controls it to some degree. Issyl's servants claim to have seen a number of unexplainable occurrences since that night. A guard who was leaning against the wall of that same tower with one hand had it wither away to a shriveled claw. Another saw an entire wing of Issyl's stone keep erode into ruin overnight. Other sightings include a servant who glanced out the window of an empty storeroom to find the sun racing across the sky. Issyl himself is sometimes seen moving throughout his castle at a furious rate, while at other times he seems to stand in place like a statue. Issyl has since been attempting to cure his condition by experimenting on others. His laboratory is often filled with the shriveled old bodies of unwilling subjects who, only days before, were mere children. Just as Koril is referred to as the \"master of the college of space,\" Issyl is often called the \"master of the college of time.\" In battle, Issyl carries a massive spiked hourglass that he uses to bash opponents with as he all but skips around them at speeds far beyond even the quickest of beasts. Issyl can be quite the troublesome opponent even for those with the skill to actually hurt him, for wounds he takes in battle knit with unnatural swiftness, as if days had passed in mere seconds.Usage  Although unnaturally swift, Issyl is not a fighter and prefers to stay away from the battlefield, being a perfect support unit that hastes his allies, allowing them to cover long distances in a short period of time or drastically improving their battle potential. He is always near his allies, hasting them and recovering his stamina, to only haste them again.Trivia Quotes (Move) Quotes (Attack) Battle Realms Overview  Battle Realms is a real-time strategy game released by Ubisoft and Crave Entertainment in 2001, developed by Liquid Entertainment. With a strong Japanese theme, the game's \"Clans\" are composed of the Serpent, Lotus, and Wolf clans, with rumors of an ancient Dragon clan. There are two distinct storylines that take place in over 36 scenarios. Each sides core campaign has 14 scenarios, but gameplay choices will affect the path of the game. During your campaign you can have up to six different Zen Masters to help you. Provided you keep them alive, they will carry over from mission to mission. Once the Keep becomes available to you, you will no longer have to worry about keeping them alive.The Campaign Plot  The campaign starts off as Kenji returns home and must decide whether to revive the great legacy of the noble Dragon Clan, or to simply follow in the footsteps as his corrupt predecessors by leading the insidious Serpent Clan. Regardless, Kenji will find himself up in arms against the Wolf Clan, the Lotus Clan, and perhaps even the horde his ancestors thought they escaped. You can learn more about the History of Battle Realms' here.Setting  The entire story of Battle Realms takes place in a fictional universe rather than real earth, taking to an unknown continent, which is quite often referred to by many players as \"Battle Realms Island\". There are quite a few locations that can be accessed through the campaign of \"Kenji's Journey\", or by playing \"Battle Realms: Winter of The Wolf\" and playing through \"Grayback's Journey\".\"Precursor To War\"  Long ago, back when Battle Realms was still in development, a special edition of the game was available to the interested customers. Such sites as IGN used to promote it. According to IGN, this edition came with extras such as:The Collector's Edition Medal  At some point, there was also a number of custom-made medals shipped along with the collector's edition. There's a long story connected to one of them, the image of which you're currently seeing: Basically, one fan of the game had found an announcement posted online by a warehouse worker who didn't know what it was (the image on the right is taken by that worker). That fan had messaged the worker and asked if he could send this piece to him, the worker agreed but the shipping address was wrongly stated and the item got lost on its way and is now lost forever. it was later confirmed by Ed Del Castillo (when the fan messaged him back in 2014, during the Liquid Videocast Era to tell him this story), that these medals indeed existed and he wouldn't be against having one himself. The medal shows the early Battle Realms logo which is meant to represent Yin & Yang symbol in its own unique style. It was around during the release of the game and could be seen all over the official sites and forums (the CD back cover also has it). It is unknown why the original game icon is different from it. Unfortunately, no screenshots of these editions or archived online copies are to be found. No other good shots of the medal either. If you have these editions or the medal in your possession or can shed the light on this case, please do.Kazan  Kazan is a Zen Master of the Dragon Clan.Overview  A foolish person might mistake Kazan for a happy drunk. Certainly, he's rarely seen without a drink in hand, but anyone who might think to take advantage of this man's not-quite-sober demeanor is in for a nasty surprise. A drunkard or not, Kazan is a formidable fighter. At well over 7 feet in height, his brute force alone is enough to take on all but the toughest opponents. However, he possesses a skill that most people would mistake for black magic: the art of fire. Legend has it that Tarrant, the ancient leader of the Serpent Clan, adventured with the four elemental brothers, warriors who each had mastered one of the four elements (earth, wind, fire, and water). Elemental mastery has been passed down to successive generations ever since. Kazan's master, Kamato, taught Kazan about fire (and taught him well). As such, Kazan is one of the four current Elemental Brothers of the Serpent Clan, a monastic fighting order now scattered. Kazan the Fire Brother, however, is still very much with us, wandering the land, drinking, and lighting things on fire. In turbulent times he occasionally joins up with a traveling circus troupe, where his huge size and boisterous disposition appear less conspicuous to hostile eyes. And in most contexts, Kazan is quite conspicuous indeed - he is a huge man, enormously fat and invariably drunk on the poisonously strong brew he carries with him in a pumpkin-sized gourd. In a fight it is usually the closest thing at hand and he swings it to deadly effect. Fires are his friend and element, and as such poses little danger to him - explosions and other fires and do little harm to his tough hide.Kenji's Journey Path of the Dragon  Kazan appears in the Swan's pool in which a wolf clansman is seen frantically disturbing a geisha and admidst the disturbance, he quickly intervenes telling him to get away from the geisha and starts fighting off the wolf clansman until Kenji and their forces subdued him. Just as the head of the geisha shows up and realizing that Kenji is alive after falsely believing of his demise, she informs him of another threat posed by the Wolf clan as they attack the Swan's pool in search of the Serpent's orb forcing Kazan to join in its defense as well witness the appearance of the \"ninja\" presumably stealing the orb only to find out its location is in Serpentholm. Kazan later accompanies Kenji in its journey to the Dragon's Spire in order to sought the Dragon's help in which they stumbled onto an abandoned and ruined Lotus village which caused the entire garrison to be wiped out by the Dragon and afterwards faced the Dragon in which he set him and Kenji on a series of trials which Kenji succeeded and gains counsel to the Dragon. Upon returning from the Dragon's Spire, he describes the Dragon to Kenji as cryptic and Kenji replies to him of the end of the Dragon's time and regretting his decision in going there. Kazan immediately discovers Otomo's body crucified in a wooden cross after the latter was executed under Shinja's orders. Otomo's body was lowered down and was given a proper burial then Kazan noticed the very presence of Lotus soldiers that have reached beyond Serpentholm then Kenji replies that they've been betrayed. Kazan suggests for him to encircle around the Lotus in order to evade them but Kenji refuses and insists that to sought help from a nearby local village and intends to stay and fight in which Kazan accepts. (At that point, Kazan succeeded Otomo as Kenji's retainer and second-in-command.) After eliminating a Lotus clan garrison in its path and upon reaching to Serpentholm, Kenji and Kazan mustered its forces against Shinja's forces and the Lotus allies. With the recapture of Serpentholm as well the defeat of Shinja's forces and its Lotus allies, they turned towards Shinja's Keep and as the Keep was destroyed, Shinja appeared and urges his warriors to come at his side and kill the \"Pretender\" which the latter gains the upper hand, resulting to Shinja's death and Otomo's murder avenged. After the battle, Kazan and Kenji observed a group of Wolf refugees entering Serpentholm in which Kazan tells that the Wolf clan has been defeated at the hands of the Lotus clan and Kenji urges him to provide the Wolf refugees with food and shelter then Kazan notifies Kenji on their next move either to enlist the monk's or the ninja's aid in which Kazan despises the assassins of being treacherous. After enlisting either the monks or the ninjas, Kazan and Kenji came into a parley with Zymeth, the mysterious ninja as well its bodyguards in which Zymeth talked briefly with Kenji on their past experiences (Kenji serving as a prince and heir to the Serpent throne while Zymeth was then a chief adviser to Lord Oja at that time before the conflict started between the Serpent and the Lotus clans) then negotiated to end the conflict as well stating of their possession of the orb which Kenji describes it as meaningless and ended the negotiations into failure. Kazan later participated in its final battle against the Lotus as well the Dark one which revealed its true form. Upon its death, a number of Hordelings summoned to the Dark one's command swarmed towards to Kenji in different direction and then an illuminating flash of light suddenly shined out (when Kenji receives the Dragon's power) toward the creatures, killing them instantly. Afterwards, Kazan formally proclaims the Dragon(Kenji) as some of the Dragon clansmen bowed in respect and honored him.Trivia Quotes (Move) Quotes (Attack) Quotes (Kill) Quotes (Heal) Longtooth  Longtooth is a Zen Master in Wolf Clan.Overview  Longtooth is from the generation of Wolves known as \"slaveborn.\" This is the generation of children who were born after the enslavement war between the Wolf and Lotus Clans and before the revolt. Like other slaveborn, Longtooth never roamed the forests, never hunted by the moonlight, and never participated in the ancient Wolf tradition of wolfball. He wasn't ignorant of Wolf traditions, however. Every night, Wolf Clan elders would gather round all the slaveborn children and tell them tales of times when the Wolves were free -- none among the slaveborn listened more intently than Longtooth. When he'd return to the mines during the day, Longtooth would shatter shards of shale with his bare fists, easing the pain by pretending that the shards were his Lotus slavers. Some years later, when Grayback sent word of the Wolf revolt, Longtooth proved himself to be a warrior worthy of his ancestral blood. His particular mine was overseen by a fearsome Lotus warlock called Iphliss. If not for Longtooth's presence, Iphliss and his deadly lightning spells would have single-handedly put down the revolt in that mineshaft. In fact, Longtooth saw his fellow Wolves fall to the magician's spells and thought all was lost. Sure that it would be a suicidal move, Longtooth rushed Iphliss, and with one blow he beheaded the warlock. Iphliss' lifeless body was hung atop Longtooth's mine as a trophy to rally other Wolves to fight that night, and in the morning it was used as a monument to the Wolf Clan's hard-fought freedom. Even as a slave-child, Longtooth was famous for his athleticism - leaping between rocks and swimming through the treacherous underground waterways, he astonished his masters. When the uprising came, those abilities were matched by a terrifying hatred and impressive generalship. His deeds of that night have placed him next in line for clan leadership. In battle Longtooth carries a unique weapon, a heavy bladed boomerang coated with a special alloy that he has learned to hurl with astonishing accuracy, carving through men and buildings as easily as air. Uneven battlegrounds also give him a special advantage, as his athletic ability grants him a mobility others lack.Notes Trivia  There exists another unit, Longtooth Slave, who has similar health, attacks, and armor multipliers, except decent resistance to Blunt (-50%) but weakness to Explosive (+50%), similar to free Longtooth before BP3 & WotW.Quotes (Move) Quotes (Attack) Quotes (Kills) Quotes (Heal) Tao  Tao is a Zen Master, officially belonging to the Dragon Clan.Background  This enigmatic mercenary has been observed wandering the land for at least forty years, perhaps far longer. He travels alone and simply, seldom mounted, carrying only a long staff and a small sack of rice, sleeping in barns or under the stars. He is described as tall and slender, speaking little, never giving trouble. Those foolish or desperate enough to bother him have seen that he is lightning quick on both attack and defense. He seldom enlists in any struggle for long, and may work with Serpent as well as Dragon. He claims to serve neither yin nor yang but only a balance between them. Most mysteriously, he has ties to both monk and ninja organizations, and seems to share some of both their traits.Trivia Quotes (Move) Quotes (Attack) Quotes (Heal) ", "Battle Arena Toshinden Wiki": "Battle Arena Toshinden Wiki Battle Arena Toshinden 3  Characters from Battle Arena Toshinden 3 video games.Battle Arena Toshinden Wiki  \"World travelling fighters, brought together by a common destiny, now meet at the Battle Arena Toshinden: a fighting tournament hosted by a mysterious organization known only as the \"Secret Society\" Many years have passed since this tournament, known only to those in the underworld, was last held.

Featured profileToshinden(Wii)  Characters from Toshinden(Wii) video games.Toshinden 4  Characters from Toshinden 4 video games.Eiji Shinjo Description  Eiji Shinjo is a fictional, playable character in the Battle Arena Toshinden series, making his first appearance in Battle Arena Toshinden and since having to appear in the subsequent games in the series as the main protagonist (alongside with the main deuteragonist Ellis). Up until Toshinden Subaru, he possesses one of the Four Sacred Arms, namely the Byakko no Tachi (White Tiger Sword). He later uses a katana similar to Sho's after he pass his Byakko no Tachi to his nephew, Subaru.Character History  Eiji and his best friend and rival, Kayin Amoh, were both trained from a very young age in the ways of the sword by Eiji's older brother Sho Shinjo. One day, however, Sho simply vanished, leaving Eiji and Kayin behind. As Eiji's skills in swordsmanship grew, so did his desire to find his lost brother, and before long Eiji left in search of Sho, becoming a world-renowned adventurer who would soon gain quite a remarkable reputation from within the fighting world. Along Eiji's travels, he fought and defeated a man by the name of Duke B. Rambert. Unknown to both of them, they would meet again many times over. Eventually, word reached Eiji of a tournament known as the Toshindaibukai, which was to include the best warriors the from across the globe, Kayin and Duke among them. Eiji enters the tournament in hopes of finding his brother Sho there. After defeating the opponents that stood in his way, Eiji would eventually face off against Gaia, who was holding the tournament illegally. The rightful holders of the tournament, however, intervened in the match, denying Eiji's victory. Eiji had then entered the second tournament, believing that his brother would be there, but Sho had killed the tournament's sponsors, Uranus and Master. Sometime after the tournament, Eiji finally encountered Sho, but despite narrowly defeating him, Eiji still lost. Advised to follow the destiny of one's own path by his older brother, Eiji soon realized that he needed to follow his own path as both a man and a fighter, and not in the footsteps of his older brother. However, Eiji soon was confronted by the vicious Vermilion, and had fought to the death with the shadowy assailant, in which Eiji had emerged victorious while Vermilion had hastily retreated, warning Eiji that he and the rest of the Toshinden fighters would soon face a living hell of a nightmare in the near future. Soon enough a year later, Eiji had shockingly discovered that his battle with Vermillion was no mere coincidence; Vermillion was in fact a part of the Organization's intelligence gathering division and upon his recon, Eiji and the fighters were selected to be human sacrifices for both the destructive fighting god, Agon Teos and the bloody rituals of the Organization. Given a deadly ultimatum, Eiji had bravely decided to enter and fight for his life in the third tournament alongside with his fellow Toshinden fighters. With his participation, Eiji and the other Toshinden warriors had also confronted the Soshiki assassins and headhunters led by Abel. Eiji had first fought against Leon: a vicious pirate of the Organization who had wanted to prove himself that he was the toughest in the world, and regain payback on Eiji for a past defeat. However, Eiji killed him from within their fight. After that, he fought and seemingly killed Vermilion\u00a0from within their clash. Eiji then found his long lost brother Sho and proceeded to face him in battle. After a long duel, Eiji defeated him and saw that Sho was very proud of his now strong swordsmanship. He then made his way to the throne room of the Soshiki and killed the leader Abel in a fierce and dangerous fight. It wasn't over however, since Veil: the former leader of the Soshiki who had been imprisoned by Abel, had broken free and wanted to have revenge. Eiji defeated and killed him too after a long and bloody fight. Afterwards, Sho had left his young son, Subaru in Eiji's care and had completetly disappeared, never to be seen again. Eiji had taught Subaru the way of the sword and eventually passed down the Byakko no Tachi to him. Ten years later, Eiji was offered a chance to become the leader of a new evil Organization called the Gerard Foundation. While Eiji had initiatlly accepted the deal, he had hoped to secretly dismantle it from within so that the world would be safe from the Gerald Foundation. With the help of the altered humans Eos and Zero, he had sponsored and participated in the fourth Toshindabukai to gather the 4 Sacred Arms before anyone else did. In the fourth Toshindabukai, Subaru had met Eiji from within the finals and challenged him to a battle so that he could test his skills. Eiji, despite now having a cold exterior, was very proud of his nephew for becoming strong, but before they could fully reunite, Vermilion showed up once more. This time, however, Eiji defeated and killed him, thus ensuring the safety of the world's own future. He has an alternate ending where the player plays as Eiji and his group when he defeats his nephew Subaru who tries so hard to train all he had knew. Eiji angrily berates him for being weak and also dishonors him for using the Byakko no Tachi as he reprimands him to return the katana and leave. However in Subaru's ending where Eiji was defeated by him, he was proud to see his skills were improved and the Byakko no Tachi chose him as its owner. He also gives the Four Sacred Arms to Subaru before he was engulfed in a flash of yellow light, teleporting him into the other dimension to see his father Sho as the glowing ball of light. In the end of the fourth Toshindaibukai, Eiji looked at the blade of his katana where he can see the reflection of his late older brother Sho.Game Appearance  Eiji has short spiky brown hair and brown eyes. In the first Toshinden, he wears a white headband and a white-with-red-trim gi with two horizontal diamond motifs on his sleeves, tied with a black belt. Eiji's gloves are black and fingerless and feature white bandages along his forearm from his wrist almost to his elbow. He wears black pants, three layer white leg warmers with a diamond trace cut out to show the red cloth and brown hiking boots. Eiji has an alternate appearance which features blue stripes instead of red and artificial feet and his hair is black. In the second Toshinden, his white-with-red-trim gi is cut sleeveless, with two small white evenly shaped diamonds placed on his chest area collar trim, and where the gi has two inward cuts to the robe's placket. He wears a black leather strip woven undershirt with traditionally designed black leather gloves, and the same jeans, hiking boots, and leg warmers. In the third Toshinden, he retains most of his outfit, with the exception of wearing gray motorcycle gloves with white bandages and double layered leather metatarsal guard wrapping reinforced waterproofed hiking boots. His weapon, the Byakko no Tachi, takes on the form of a steel tachi katana with a black leather and black same lacquered handle with a gold pommel cap, tsuba hand guard that is colored in red and black, and a gold menkuchi fitting. In some instances, the tsuba is that of a nerikawa tsuba, with red lacquered leather. The scabbard is lacquered black, and is outfitted with gold caps and mouthpieces, with a superficial gold foil sheet sageo wrapping detail at its near base. The blade is of form similar to qualities of Masamune style swords, with a thicker width of blade matching the width of the handle, and with a great deal of nie and nioi scattered about the hamon. In the OVA version, Eiji has three outfits when he is not fighting as well as he primarily fights his best friend and rival, Kayin. He wears a brown rider jacket with a matching two red horizontal line in each sides of his jacket. Underneath is a high-neck white and red-trimmed vest with a red diamond trims at the center of his vest and a red zipper going down to his waist, dark blue rider pants with red linings and white and gray rubber sneakers. His white headband becomes shorter instead of long. During the brief fight against Kayin and meeting with Ellis, he was seen without the brown rider jacket. In his nightmare while confronting his older brother, Sho which is later revealed to be the clone created by Uranus. He was seen wearing a dark red traditional Japanese garb, matching dark red hakama and black sandals. After he was plagued by his nightmare and being comforted by Sofia before she assassinates him, he only wears a pair of black trousers. His alternate costume in Battle Arena Toshinden 3 is still his primary outfit but now have short sleeves on his white gi and the red-trimmed design becomes black with two horizontal diamond designs in each sides on both of his sleeves. This outfit is also shown in the OVA version where he fights Gaia in the tournament but the red-trimmed from his primary outfit is retained. In Battle Arena Toshinden 4, Eiji's spiky brown hair becomes white and now wears a black headband. He retains his white-with-red gi and his belt is now a black and red sash and his black undershirt is replaced with a high neck baggy shirt which he can conceals the half of his face. He also retains his black pants and black fingerless gloves and the bandages on his forearm is replaced with black and red bulkier armguards and dons a red and white samurai-genji armor on his gi and his ankle coverings are now bulkier and the color is white and gray and his brown shoes is replaced with a traditional black and white Japanese shoes with red linings.Gameplay  Eiji is literally the ideal starting character. He is one of Toshinden's 2 all-rounders, having no advantages or disadvantages compared to the other fighters. Eiji's attack power, speed, and endurance are the standard by which all of the other fighters abilities are measured. In this respect, Eiji is often compared to Ryu of the Street Fighter franchise. Ryu is a video game character created by Capcom, and is the main protagonist of the majority of the games in the the Street Fighter series. In Toshinden Subaru, Eiji's gameplay appears a lot more powerful than his nephew and he is also compared to Ryu's adoptive father and master Gouken as his nephew's comparision is Ryu.Game Endings Battle Arena Toshinden 2  Eiji grew up in awe of his brother Sho, the might warrior, and never imagined he could ever surpass him. His quest to find Sho eventually led him to victory in the Toshinden Battle Arena. Looking at the one who fought to protect the secret organization, he finally understands a great truth - that the power to shape our destiny lies in our own hands...Battle Arena Toshinden 3  No matter who he fought, Eiji was overshadowed by the reputation of his brother Sho. Now that he has gained victory in the Toshindaibukai, he realizes that the only person he has to compete against is himself. Eiji's companions also managed to survive the fierce battle in which Eiji thwarted the evil plot of the Organization. Eiji learned a valuable lesson during the great battle - that one fights not only for oneself, but for others also. He cannot express this understanding in words, but he feels it deeply in his heart. Eiji's journey has only just begun...Voice Actors Relationships Move Lists  Eiji's signature moves in the series are fire based similar to his older brother, Sho and is more focused on slashing his opponents. In Toshinden Subaru, Eiji's moves are slightly damaging like his older brother did before him and his special attacks are different than his nephew Subaru's which is far more powerful than his normal attacks in the previous games.Special Attacks Overdrive Secret Move Desperation Move Trivia Battle Arena Toshinden 2  Characters from Battle Arena Toshinden 2 video games.Battle Arena Toshinden  Battle Arena Toshinden (\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30a2\u30ea\u30fc\u30ca\u95d8\u795e\u4f1d) is a weapons-based fighting game developed by Tamsoft and published by Takara and Sony Computer Entertainment in 1995-1996 for the PlayStation, Sega Saturn, Game Boy, and PC. It was one of the first fighting games to boast polygonal characters in a 3D environment, and it is credited for taking the genre into \"true 3-D\" due to its introduction of the sidestep maneuver. The game was originally promoted as a PlayStation exclusive, with Sony initially promoting it as a \"Saturn killer\" (against Sega's Virtua Fighter), but it was ported to the Saturn with additional features less than a year later. Once fighting games like Tekken started emerging, Battle Arena Toshinden quickly declined in popularity, but still did spawn a series of sequels. It was the first 3D weapons fighter, and was succeeded in spirit by Soul Edge and other games of the genre.Gameplay  Each character has his or her own unique set of basic moves, special attacks, and a desperation attack that can only be used when the player has low energy (around 10% or less). The player is able to move in 3D around the 3D arenas using the L/R shoulder buttons, which can be used to dodge projectile attacks, or get away from a dangerous spot. Players move using the directional pad. Holding the backwards directional button allows the player to block basic attacks and reduces most of the damage from opponents' special moves. Players can also run by quickly tapping the forward directional button.Plot  A young Japanese swordsman/adventurer named Eiji Shinjo, who has spent the past few years searching for his long-lost older brother, Sho, enters the legendary Battle Arena Toshinden tournament hosted by a mysterious organization known only as the Secret Society, along with seven other traveling fighters, the fighters themselves being Eiji's best friend/rival, Kayin Amoh, a Scottish bounty hunter who seeks revenge against the previous tournament champion of last year for the death of his foster father; Sofia, an amnesiac Russian private detective who is seeking her long-lost past memories; Rungo Iron, an American miner who is determined to rescue his kidnapped family from the Secret Society; Fo Fai, a Chinese magician/serial killer who enters the tournament in order to satisfy his personal bloodlust; Mondo, a Japanese ninja who is undertaking an infiltration mission for a rival group of the Secret Society; Duke B. Rambert, a French knight seeking revenge against Eiji for a past defeat; and Ellis, a cheerful and kind-hearted orphaned dancer who is seeking personal answers regarding her long-lost missing father. Eiji progresses through the tournament and ultimately comes face-to-face with the tournament's sponsor, the mysterious Gaia and even though Eiji manages to hold his own against Gaia from within their final battle against each other, the tournament is unexpectedly halted when it is soon discovered that Gaia is holding the competition without the Secret Society's permission, with the intention of acquiring fighters in order to help him overthrow the organization as a part of his personal vendetta against them. Gaia is forced to flee into hiding while leaving Eiji no closer to finding his long-lost older brother.Characters  Initially playable characters: Unlockable characters:Release  The original PlayStation version was ported by Nextech/Sega to the Sega Saturn as Toh Shin Den S in Japan and as Battle Arena Toshinden Remix in the United States and Europe. A few new features were added, including an exclusive new character named Cupido and a story mode which enables the player to learn a few details about the characters' story backgrounds and the reasons of why they had entered into the tournament. Work on the Saturn port began while the PlayStation original was still in development. Developed by Digital Dialect, the DOS port of the PlayStation version added an exclusive new character, Earthworm Jim, complete with his own unique arena music, but he only uses the moves of Rungo Iron. It also supports resolutions up to 640x480. The PC port uses the Japanese PlayStation version's voices and music in all regions, unlike the original PlayStation version. The game was also ported to the Game Boy by Takara in 1996, titled Nettou Toshinden in Japan. The game is based mostly on the original PlayStation version, but it includes a slightly altered story mode and an early appearance of the character Uranus and the Battle Arena Toshinden 2 version of Gaia (without his armor).Reception  Battle Arena Toshinden was critically acclaimed when released. It holds an average GameRankings score of 85% based on 2 reviews. Electric Playground gave the game a perfect score of 10 out of 10 in 1995. On release, Famicom Ts\u016bshin scored the PlayStation version of the game a 30 out of 40, and gave it first a 9 out of 10 and later a 10 out of 10 in their Reader Cross Review. GamePro reviewed the Japanese version of the game in early 1995 (prior to the PlayStation's launch in the U.S.). They remarked that the game is very impressive, and superior to Virtua Fighter in some aspects, but also flawed in several respects. They particularly praised the texture-mapped polygon graphics, original fighters, myriad moves, unique style of play, and the sidestep move, commenting that \"The only problem with this slick defensive move is that from some viewing angles, the fighters obstruct the front of the screen, making it impossible to see where a move is coming from.\" Their review of the later U.S. release was also generally positive; they praised the graphics, stage design, playability, and dynamic camera, but criticized the game for being simplistic and easy, remarking that \"This game relies more on flash than fighting.\" They summarized the game as \"an enjoyable fight.\" Next Generation also reviewed the game prior to the PlayStation's U.S. launch. They commented that while the gameplay lacks originality and good reaction speed, the 3D aesthetics and graphics make it a much more powerful experience to play than a typical 2D fighter. However, they concluded that the game loses \"by a hair\" when compared to its rival, Virtua Fighter. The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the game a rave review, chiefly praising the character design, graphics, and special moves. Maximum made note of the graphical and gameplay innovations such as gouraud shading, rotational backgrounds, dramatic camera angles, and the sidestep. However, they remarked that the poor quality directional pad on the original PlayStation controller \"just isn't built for taking diagonals and quarter circle rolls\", making it irritatingly difficult to pull off special moves. Though they assessed the game as good overall, they advised gamers to instead hold out for the PlayStation port of Tekken, which they felt to be far superior in every respect. IGN gave the game a score of 7 out of 10 in 1996, by which time it was seen as slow and \"not as impressive\" as the more recent Tekken 2, though they praised Toshinden for important innovations to the fighting game genre, such as taking \"the fighter into true 3-D\" and \"one little move\" that \"changed the fighter forever\" with the introduction of sidestep movement. Dragon Magazine gave the game 3 out of 5 stars. In an early 1995 interview, when asked which PlayStation game he was most impressed with so far, Ken Kutaragi answered Battle Arena Toshinden. Battle Arena Toshinden was awarded Best Fighting Game of 1995 by Electronic Gaming Monthly. However, during their 200th issue leadup in 2005, they ranked Battle Arena Toshinden as their single most overrated game. They explained that it \"was 3D, it was flashy--Battle Arena Toshinden was exciting and new. But later Namco showed us what really could be done with 3D fighting on the PlayStation (Tekken, Soul Blade). (...) But is it actually good? Oh God, no.\" The Sega Saturn version was not as well-received as the PlayStation original. The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly complained of the fact that the graphics were not improved from the PlayStation version, and felt that the game was overshadowed by the recent release of Battle Arena Toshinden 2. While Rob Allsetter of Sega Saturn Magazine greatly praised the visuals of the game and judged the button configuration to be superior to that of the PlayStation version, he criticized the \"slow\" gameplay and the limited variety of moves, concluding that Battle Arena Toshinden is \"still decent enough, but ... lacks the speed and depth of its more illustrious successors.\" A reviewer for Next Generation said that the visuals of the Japanese release were not up to par with those of the PlayStation version, and advised Saturn owners to wait for the U.S. release in hopes that Sega of America would fix the graphical shortcomings. Tommy Glide of Gamepro commented that there is not enough additional content in the Saturn version and the graphics do not look as smooth as the PlayStation version's, assessing it as overall \"a poor conversion.\" Rich Leadbetter of Maximum stated that it fails to recreate the graphical effects of the PlayStation original, which he opined were the only saving grace of an extremely dull game. He held the additional character and the PAL conversion's lack of borders to be its only advantages over the PlayStation version. According to Next Generation, the Saturn release also had \"disappointing sales\" in Japan, which they attributed to the strong association of the game with the PlayStation (due to the use of the character Ellis in Japanese ads for the PlayStation) and its weak use of the Saturn hardware when compared to Virtua Fighter 2.Legacy  During the late 1990s, the game was followed by three sequels, Battle Arena Toshinden 2, Battle Arena Toshinden 3, and Toshinden 4, as well as a spin-off game Battle Arena Nitoshinden. An anime adaptation of the same title was also released in 1996. Eiji appeared as a secret guest character in the Sega Saturn game D-Xhird, released by Takara in 1997. A new T\u014dshinden (\u95d8\u771f\u4f1d) game was unveiled in Weekly Famitsu in 2008. It was developed by DreamFactory for the Nintendo Wii and has no connection to the previous games' storyline. It is titled War Budokai, roughly translated as War Tournament. While previous Toshinden installments feature mainly weapons-based combat, War Budokai features hand-to-hand combat alongside the weapons-based battles. A total of 8 characters were unveiled in official illustrations. The game was released in Japan on December 10, 2009.External links Sofia Description  Sofia  (\u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u044f) is a fictional, playable character in the first three installments of the Battle Arena Toshinden video game series. She is a very well endowed Russian, whip-wielding private detective and a friend of Eiji Shinjo.Character History  Sofia had entered the first Toshindabukai in the hopes of finding some clues to her own shrouded and mysterious past, due to the fact that she was suffering from an unknown amnesia, but she had eventually learned from Gaia that her memory had been tampered with by the Himitsu Kessha. Shocked yet angry, Sofia had left the tournament in an instant. She had been told of the life she once had, but nothing could equal a true memory and because of this, she was full of sorrow. When Sofia had learned that another fighter was suffering from the same fate as her (Chaos), she had entered the second Toshindabukai in the hopes of saving them and although she was unsuccessful in her mission, the Himitsu Kessha had soon fallen, giving Sofia some relief and comfort. After the events of the second tournament, Sofia had soon discovered the existence of the criminal organization known as the Soshiki, and had become allured by one of their goals, being the \"rebirth of humans through magic\", which oddly resonated with her, and especially to her pains of not knowing her true past. She then soon entered the third tournament when she learned that she had been targeted by the Soshiki and was confronted by an assassin in the form of her old whip-wielding rival; the Austrian catwoman Zola. During the tournament, Sofia eventually came to realize that the Soshiki's goals were ultimately flawed by their use of horrific rituals and human sacrifice, killed Zola in combat, and after hearing of the Soshiki's fall, retired from fighting for good. Even though she realizes that she'll never gain back her old memories, Sofia is determined to create new memories so that she can throw away her personal sorrow and embrace true happiness.Game Appearance  Sofia appears to have a long blonde hair which is tied in a high ponytail, white skinned, blue eyes and very large breasts. From Battle Arena Toshinden and Battle Arena Toshinden 2 she wears a black sleeveless leotard, leg and arm warmers and black high heels. In Battle Arena Toshinden 3, her outfit is a revealing gold and black leotard with a matching cross straps that covers her large breasts. She also have another black and gold straps on her thigh and her feet and the right one on her leg as well as both of her arms and wears black high heels with black and gold wraps on both of her ankles. Her alternate appearance of her primary outfit has minor changes and the color of her leotard changed from black to red. In the opening scene and her in-game appearance, the straps on Sofia's leotard are horizontal to cover her large breasts instead of being cross straps. In the OVA version, Sofia is seen wearing a dark blue and off-pink loose turtleneck shirt with number '200' imprinted at the center of her shirt and dark blue lines in both sides of her long sleeves , black cycling shorts, off-pink socks and brown sandals. This outfit where she meets Eiji after he beats the kids in a soccer game off-screen until she assassinates him at night. During her assassination attempt on Eiji while in Uranus' mind control and fighting against a cloned Sho after Eiji frees her, she is later seen wearing a dark gray leotard with black leathered long sleeves, dark gray leg warmers in both of her legs and black high heels. Her alternate costume in Battle Arena Toshinden 3 has her wearing a purple revealing dress which is shows her cleavage as the short skirt of her dress reaches to her right knee, purple warmers and black high heels. She also wears a purple choker on her neck to match her outfit.Battle Arena Toshinden 3 Ending  The Organization hid its ruthless ambition behind fine sounding slogans about creating a new and ideal world, but Sofia will never forget the tragedy it caused. She fought bravely against the Organization, accepting the burden of her destiny. During battle, she found something no one will ever be able to change - trust between friends and the loyalty that comes from overcoming hardships together. She will never regain the memories she has lost, but the warmth in her heart is more important to her than any memory from her stolen past.Voice Actors Move Lists  Sofia's signature moves are focused on her whip by whiplashes her opponent as well as kicking her opponents along with her whip.Special Attacks Overdrive Secret Move Desperation Move Trivia Battle Arena Toshinden  Characters from Battle Arena Toshinden video games.Ellis Description  Ellis  is a fictional, playable character in the first three installments of the Battle Arena Toshinden video game series. She is a cheerful dancer who is considered to being the main deuteragonist of the series (alongside with the main protagonist\u00a0Eiji Shinjo). Although the games state Ellis to be Turkish, she is actually Japanese, this reference is not revealed until the second game.Character History  A close friend of Eiji Shinjo and\u00a0Kayin Amoh, Ellis is a fighter skilled in the art of the twin dirk daggers, and is also a circus performer for a traveling theater troupe. She was raised in an orphanage in Turkey, being told that her parents and brother had been killed in a car crash when she was a young child. Ellis, after reaching the age of 16, moved to Japan where she would meet and eventually develop an unreturned crush on Eiji, who was bitter at the sudden disappearance of his older brother and mentor,\u00a0Sho. Along with Eiji and Kayin, Ellis had entered the first Toshindaibukai in order to test her fighting skills and abilities, but she, along with all the other participating fighters, discovered that the tournament had been held illegally by a man named\u00a0Gaia, whom Eiji had been battling at the time. Furious at Gaia for deceiving her, Ellis returned home with Eiji and Kayin. However, a year later, Ellis had received a letter from Gaia, who was calling for help. To both her shock and horror, the letter revealed that Gaia was actually her father and that she and Gaia were the only ones to survive the car crash sixteen years ago. It also revealed that Ellis was actually Japanese and not Turkish. It seemed that Gaia had been targeted for death by the Himitsu Kessha for holding the first Toshindaibukai without their consent and approval, and now needed help if he was to avenge the deaths of his wife and son, who had been killed when Uranus caused the fatal car accident. Fighting her personal hatred, Ellis had entered the second Toshindaibukai and encountered a man named\u00a0Rungo Iron, who claimed to be a friend of Gaia's who had also received a call for help. Eventually reuniting with her father, Ellis had fought in the tournament, but was knocked out by a Chinese magician named\u00a0Fo Fai, leaving Gaia and Rungo to fight along with their new ally Eiji. Ellis eventually heard that Uranus had been slain before Gaia and Rungo could reach her, and Gaia came home to Ellis, wanting to start a new life together with her in order to help rebuild and re-establish their father-daughter relationship, to which Ellis had happily agreed with. However, Ellis, Gaia, and Rungo were selected by the Soshiki as blood sacrifices for Agon Teos, being targeted by several of\u00a0Abel's\u00a0own assassins. In addition to herself being targeted, Ellis also found that the children in her troupe were kidnapped and were to be sacrificed in the Organization's activities, if she did not comply with their demands. Along with Eiji and Kayin, they entered the third Toshindaibukai. Rungo had to fight\u00a0Adam: a robot about his own size and Gaia had been targeted by\u00a0Tau: a tribal giant. Ellis had encountered another assassin named\u00a0Atahua: a tribal boy. Ellis fought Atahua with all her might, but when Tau showed up and claimed that he had forfeited his match against Gaia, Atahua had abandoned his own fight with Ellis as well, understanding now that fighting was pointless and that it wouldn't help him achieve his personal goal. Ellis and Gaia bid farewell to Tau and Atahua, and left the tournament. When the tournament had reached its climactic end, Ellis had successfully saved her extended family from both danger and the confines of the Organization. Since the destruction of the Soshiki, Ellis and Gaia have not fought again, retiring from the sport for good.Voice Actors Battle Arena Toshinden 3 Ending  The battle has ended, and peace has returned once again. the children in Ellis' troupe are safe, saved by her skill and bravery. The responsibility of caring for those who are unable to defend against the tyranny of others has helped Ellis grow and mature. When she herself realizes this, she will have reached an even higher level of development, both as a fighter and as a human being.

He made his first appearance in Battle Arena Toshinden as both the secret final boss of the game and as an unlockable hidden character. He also appeared as an unlockable hidden character/hidden boss in Battle Arena Toshinden 2, and an unlockable mid-boss in Battle Arena Toshinden 3. His moveset is mostly a blend of both Eiji Shinjo and Kayin Amoh's, although his attacks are slightly more damaging and in the third game, he is significantly faster.Character History  Sho had trained his younger brother Eiji and Eiji's best friend/rival Kayin in the ways of the sword ever since the two of them were young children. One day, however, Sho had suddenly and unexpectedly vanished without any trace, leaving both Eiji and Kayin behind as he felt and decided that they had reached an adequate level of swordsmanship and could train much further without him. Sho had soon traveled around the world while taking up the name of \"The Stranger\", searching out and defeating those who were rumored to have strong fighting potential. In due time, Sho had learned that Eiji had entered the Toshindaibukai: a tournament that was to be held for the strongest fighters in the world. He watched his brother from afar and saw him facing Gaia in the finals. During this tournament, Sho had met and fought with Cupido: a woman from the Himitsu Kessha and Master's right-hand servant. The two of them would soon fall in love with each other and that they would eventually have a son named Subaru. Sho had entered the second tournament for the same reasons he did the first; to see if his brother had gotten stronger. During this tournament, he encountered Vermilion and defeated him, causing the shrouded black warrior to flee. Sho didn't care about his motives, for he had only one thing in mind: making Master and Uranus pay for making clones of him. He broke into the organization's main compound and killed Uranus and Master. He then walked out of the building just as Gaia arrived. In the third game, Sho had finally faced Eiji from within their duel against one another and not only did his brother had managed to defeat him in battle, but also had managed to bring down the Soshiki as well with the help of his friends. Personally impressed in having to see Eiji's growth as both a person and a swordsman, Sho had decided to leave Subaru with Eiji. He then asked Eiji if he could take care of him and train him the same way he had trained Eiji before from within the past. Eiji had accepted Sho's request and from there, Sho had left both Eiji and Subaru behind, continuing to travel around the world in having to fight and battle against strong and worthy opponents. In Toshinden 4/Subaru, Sho is not a playable character, yet he appears in Subaru's ending in the form of a glowing ball of light (produced by the linking of the Four Sacred Arms). This could heavily imply that Sho had unexpectedly died after the events of the third game. Sho became proud of Subaru's improving skills and he gives his son some advice to train day by day due to his unskilled training before the glowing ball of light revert back to the Four Sacred Arms and disappears. Subaru also recognizes Sho as his father when he pleads to stop to know more of his advices but it is too late when the Four Sacred Arms are disappeared. However in the end of the fourth Toshindaibukai after the player plays as Eiji and his group, Sho also appears in the reflection of Eiji's katana. Furthermore, in Toshinden 4/Subaru, Eiji's alternate costume is the same as Sho's primary costume in the Toshinden series (albeit with a visor covering his face).Game Appearance  Sho appears to have a long maroon hair with long single fringes in each side of his head and is tied in a low ponytail with a distinctive dolphin tail and purple eyes. For most of his appearances, he was seen wearing a gold and red sleeveless tunic with a gold sash to tucked on his tunic and a large purple hood at the center of his tunic. Underneath is a black and golden yellow short sleeve shirt with gold shoulder bands in each sides of his shoulders, black pants and brown thigh high boots with two silver straps in every side of his boots. He also wears brown bracelets in each wrists. In his character screen and his in-game appearance, his hair becomes shoulder length and his fringe are short. In the OVA version, his real appearance is shown in the near end of the movie who has him wearing a red long sleeve tunic shirt with a red orange sash and is tucked into his tunic shirt, black pants and black boots. He also wears a black ninja armguards instead of brown bracelets that he wore in the game and his maroon long hair becomes reddish brown and a pink laced ribbon is hanging loose on his low ponytail. His clone version of himself in the movie remains the same as the tunic shirt that he wears is purple and the sash changed from red orange to pink. His alternate costume is still his primary outfit but minor changes, the hood becomes blue as his tunic and his thigh-high boots changed to dark gray and his skin becomes almost tan and his long hair becomes purple.Game Endings Battle Arena Toshinden 2  Why does he fight?

Kayin is described as a bounty hunter, though his country of origin has changed a few times. He is described initially as Scottish, and later, British, although he possesses all the characteristics and personality traits of an American. His family in either version is descended from one of King Arthur's knights, hence his use of the sword Excalibur.Character History  At a young age, Kayin's father was killed by an underworld assassin/bounty hunter named Amou. When Amou discovered that he had slain a father, he took Kayin in to atone for it. However, Amou was killed in the finals of the tournament prior to the first game by Sho Shinjo. Kayin then took up his adoptive father's mantle as a bounty hunter, going by the codename of \"Storm\". Kayin had trained alongside with Eiji under Sho's watch until Sho himself had disappeared one day. Since then, Eiji and Kayin had continued to be the best of friends, but also the fiercest of rivals as well. Their friendship was nearly shattered when Kayin learned of his father's murder at the hands of Sho. For a while, Kayin left Eiji and went his own separate way, but the two of them would soon meet again at the second Toshindaibukai when Kayin was forced into participation after his adoptive daughter, Naru, was kidnapped by the Himitsu Kessha. Naru was the daughter of one of Kayin's past targets and he had adopted and raised her through the guilt of killing her own father. Kayin was defeated by Eiji, and so he never got to face off against his sworn enemy, Sho. Within time, Kayin soon held feelings in his heart that his own relationship with his foster father were just as coincidental as his and Naru's family bond. Desiring to know the truth of Amou's appearance in his life, Kayin had learned that he was a target of the Himitsu Kessha's long-time rival criminal group, the Soshiki and that his life and Naru's was in danger once more. Participating in the third Toshindaibukai with Eiji and the rest of his friends, Kayin had fought against and killed a Soshiki assassin named Ten Count while assisting Eiji in getting to the leader of the Soshiki, known as Abel. Though Kayin was happy to learn that the Soshiki was defeated, he learned that Amou was originally an assassin for the Organization, and that Amou had sacrificed himself to Sho in the Toshinden, to spare Kayin's own life, as the Organization had their sights set on him since he was a child. While he could truly open his heart to his daughter as a father after this revelation, Kayin realized that Naru would always be in danger because of him and through this emotional consideration, Kayin had decided to leave Naru in an orphanage, but not before giving her his Excalibur sword. Afterwards, Kayin disappeared and was never heard from again. It is unknown to what happened to Kayin afterwards, but his lack of participation in Toshinden 4/Subaru and appearance as a glowing ball of light to his daughter from within her own ending suggests that he is deceased.Game Appearance  For most of his appearance in both Battle Arena Toshinden 2 and 3, Kayin has short blonde hair with a long fringes in each side of his head and green eyes. His primary outfit is a red short sleeved leather jacket with two black shoulder armor in each side of his jacket.

Despite being discovered and attacked by Sho Shinjo, Vermilion had easily escaped from him and in due time, had informed Abel that the [[[Toshinden]] fighters would make adequate sacrifices for Agon Teos. Afterwards, he had entered the third tournament hosted by\u00a0Abel and was determined to help the Soshiki bring Agon Teos into the world, hoping to cause chaos and destruction with it. However, when Eiji Shinjo and the rest of his friends had destroyed the Soshiki and killed its leader, Vermilion had fled the scene, vowing to one day get revenge against Eiji. Ten years later, a fourth tournament was announced which was secretly being held by Eiji in an attempt to lure out Vermilion. After learning about the true powers of the Four Sacred Arms and discovering that the tournament was to include fighters wielding them, Vermilion had entered the tournament, hoping to retrieve them. Eventually, Vermilion would battle against Eiji for possession of the Four Sacred Arms and it is highly implied that Vermilion had died from within his own efforts of defeating Eiji in their last and final fight against one another.Game Endings Battle Arena Toshinden 2  It happened in an instant... The black warrior who appeared as if from nowhere has triumphed over the fighters who struggled so hard against ambition, hatred and destiny. No-one shall ever know his true form now, looking into his cold eyes, it seems that only a hopeless and desolate future awaits him...Battle Arena Toshinden 3  In the face of Vermilion's evil power, all joy and hope for the future is extinguished. Even those of the dark world stand helpless before his might. Wherever Vermilion goes, fear and terror follow. Despite working for the Organization, Vermilion always maintains a proud independence and haughty nobility. Now that the ceremony is about to begin, Vermilion stands alone to observe it. A cold smile comes to his lips as he contemplates the pleasure in store for him in the future...Game Appearance  Vermilion has very long orange hair and purple eyes as he shares the same height as his counterpart Nagisa Iwashiro and often wears his purple sunglasses. He also has purple tattoos on his forehead and the front bridge of his nose. In Toshinden Subaru, the tattoos on the bridge of his nose and forehead became red.

In Toshinden Subaru, Vermilion now wears a long black trenchcoat with shred at the edge, a black turtleneck shirt, matching pants and shoes.

In Toshinden Subaru, all of Vermilion's moves became slight damaging as he can defeat his opponent efficiently by shooting with his revolver in four hits and dealing heavy damage with his semi-machine gun.Special Attacks Overdrive Desperation Move Trivia Gaia Description  Gaia  is a fictional, playable character in the first three installments of the Battle Arena Toshinden video game series. Serving as the main antagonist and an unlockable character in the first game, he later becomes one of the secondary protagonists for the series and a regular playable character in the following two games. In the first Toshinden, Gaia was the monstrous final boss (except on the harder difficulty settings where Sho Shinjo was fought as the true final boss if the player beat every other character without losing). Wearing his armour, he took on the appearance of a Japanese warlord except for the 2 huge extra arms coming from his shoulders and ending in yellow claws. He would have been an extremely cheap character except for his one glaring weakness: Gaia is the second slowest character in the games. His jump, which launched him so high it gave both players time to think about their next few attacks before he landed, almost made up for it though. In the second Toshinden, Gaia has cast away his armour and is revealed to have middle-back length silver hair and brown eyes. He wears gold-with-black-trim chest and shoulder armour, baggy red pants, and black and metal knee-length boots. His attacks had been toned down substantially from the first game; he could no longer kill in 4 hits. Also, he no longer had his impossible high jump. In return, he was made slightly faster and easier to use.Character History  Gaia and his wife Kaede were both part of the Himitsu Kessha that sponsored the Toshindaibukai tournaments. His wife was at that time the Uranus of the organization, making up part of the \"Divine Four\" (the four highest positions in the organization under the leader). Gaia himself was practically a loyal member of the Himitsu Kessha and was at the time considered into being promoted to the Divine Four via his own past contributions for the organization so that he could work alongside with Kaede, but the woman who would potentially become the next Uranus had personally thought and decided that it would most certainly be a liable risk to have them both in the Divine Four via her own scheming machinations for the Himitsu Kessha. Gaia, Kaede, their unnamed son, and their daughter Ellis were driving in the family vehicle when it had shockingly and unexpectedly spun out of control and exploded. Gaia and Ellis miraculously survived, but Kaede and their son were not as lucky. Gaia had personally knew and realized that it had been no tragic accident and from there, he left Ellis in the care of an orphanage in Turkey so that he could pursue his family's assailants without any hindrance. In due time, Gaia was soon promoted into the Divine Four, and he eventually learned that the woman who had became Uranus in Kaede's stead had masterminded on what had happened with the car crash. Filled with personal hatred for the new Uranus, Gaia had illegally held the Toshindaibukai in search of strong warriors to aid him in his vengeful attack against her. Gaia had met Eiji Shinjo at the tournament while searching for his older brother Sho Shinjo. Gaia announced his proposition to Eiji, but before Eiji could accept or refuse, Chaos: another member of the Divine Four, intervened and stopped the fight. Chaos told Gaia that he had been labelled as a traitor and marked for death. Gaia knew he had no other choice but to flee, for if Chaos had found him, Uranus couldn't be far behind, and he could not take her down on his own. One year later, while still on the run, Gaia received an invitation to participate in the upcoming second Toshindaibukai tournament. Gaia realized that he could run all he wanted, but Uranus had an easier time finding him than she did breathing. He cast off his armour, and holding back nothing, fought against Uranus with everything he had and this time, he was fighting on Eiji's side. Gaia fought his way to the organization's headquarters, meeting up with his daughter Ellis there. After telling her his true story, he went further into the tower and fought with Chaos. The fight ended in a draw, and after Gaia discovered that both Uranus and Master had already been killed by someone else (Sho), he walked out of the tower, half-fulfilled, half-revenge starved. Upon learning that himself, his daughter, and the rest of his friends were targeted to be blood sacrifices for the destructive fighting god known as Agon Teos, Gaia had decided to enter into the third Toshindaibukai in order to stop Abel and his evil plan to bring Agon Teos into the world. While his daughter had fought against a tribal boy named Atahua, Gaia had found himself fighting against a tribal giant named Tau. After a fierce fight, Gaia was surprised to see that Tau had forfeited the match to him and that Atahua had done the same thing for Ellis. In the end, Gaia and the rest of the Toshinden fighters were successful in defeating the Soshiki, thus stopping their evil plan to bring Agon Teos into the world. Since then, Gaia has gone back home to be with Ellis and the two of them have retired from the sport of fighting.Game Endings Battle Arena Toshinden Ending  Is there no one that can defeat me? Is there not a worthy opponent among you? Come, you who dares to challenge me!Battle Arena Toshinden 2 Ending  Gaia was sure it was Uranus who had led the secret Organization into evil. But it was too late to do anything - The Master had already started out on his path of destruction. Now Gaia has triumphed; the Organization is defeated and the Master destroyed. But as he looks at the fallen Master, he remembers Ellis, and his victory suddenly seems hollow and meaningless...Battle Arena Toshinden 3 Ending  Gaia's ambitions ended up causing tragedy, but he put his life on the line and fought to save the fighters he had led into disaster. The battle was like none ever seen before, but Gaia had steeled himself for anything and in the face of his power and resolve the evil plot was foiled. It was his courageous stand that saved the fighters who had been targeted by the Organization. Having established peace and triumphed over evil Gaia can finally sheath his weapon and lead a life of solitude.Move Lists  Gaia can be seen as an overpowered individual as the final boss from the first game. From the second and third Toshinden games, the damage from his moves are drastically altered to make balance like the other characters. Gaia remains very damaging when he unleashed his overdrive from his heavily large broad sword.Special Attacks Overdrive Desperation Move Voice Actors Trivia Toshinden series Battle Arena Toshinden  Battle Arena Toshinden (\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30a2\u30ea\u30fc\u30ca\u95d8\u795e\u4f1d, Batoru Ar\u012bna T\u014dshinden) is a weapons-based fighting game for the Playstation, Sega Saturn and PC.

Though she kept waiting and hoping, Kayin never returned. As time passed, she began to think that the reason her father had left her at the orphanage was because he saw her as a burden. However, she dismissed these thoughts and began training with Kayin's legendary sword; Excalibur, determined to master his fighting style and prove she was not useless to him. On her sixteenth birthday, she ran away from the orphanage and set out to find her father and the true reason of why he had never returned for her. After learning from Duke B.

Within time, she ran into both Rook Castle, a kung-fu fighter and fan of Eiji's, and Eiji's own student and nephew, Subaru Shinjo. After Naru told Subaru the story of her father's long friendship with his uncle and showed him the invitations, the three agreed to form a team for the fourth Toshindaibukai. In her ending after defeating Vermilion, she was engulfed in a flash of yellow light as it whited out. She was later seen in another dimension and she hears her foster father's voice who she was worried to look for him as it soon forms the Four Sacred Arms into a ball of light. Naru was happy to see her foster father again and wants him and her to be a family again. Kayin, as the ball of light, tells her to follow the path on what she believes in. When Naru sadly wants to wait for him after they met each other for a long time, the ball of light reverts back into the Four Sacred Arms as it scatters away and Naru looked upward and screams her foster father's name in anguish. Naru does not realize that her father Kayin is dead after the events of the third Toshindaibukai and searching for his whereabouts and to seek the truth in participating the fourth Toshindaibukai with both Subaru and Rook is all for nothing. In the end of the fourth Toshindaibukai, Naru returns back in England and she sadly takes a phone call at night implying that she had decided to return back to the orphanage after she had left to search for her late adoptive father's whereabouts and to participate in the fourth Toshindaibukai, empty handed.Game Appearance  Naru appears to have long blonde hair which is tied into two long ponytails and green eyes.

Rambert Description  Duke B. Rambert  is a fictional, playable character in the first three installments of the Battle Arena Toshinden video game series. He is a French Nobleman, and a champion knight of his King's Castle in France.Character History  In the past, Duke was considered the strongest knight in France and a nobleman many people say was unstoppable, but all of that had changed one day when a young Japanese world-travelling adventurer named Eiji Shinjo was challenged to a duel by him. Eiji had easily bested the arrogant Frenchman, and Duke vowed revenge. For a while, Duke forgot about Eiji, and went on with his own life, eventually finding a girlfriend, but Duke turned back to fighting when he entered the Toshindaibukai tournament hosted by the Himitsu Kessha. To his horror, he came face to face with Eiji for a second time, and once again he lost pathetically, intensifying his personal hatred toward the Japanese adventurer. Ashamed, Duke decided to retire from fighting. However, Duke had entered the second Toshindaibukai after hearing and learning that his girlfriend had betrayed him and become the new Uranus of the Himitsu Kessha. Driven by personal vengeance, Duke entered the tournament, and this time, found himself fighting alongside with Eiji to find Uranus, but when Duke heard and learned that Uranus had already been slain by Eiji's older brother Sho, Duke had abandoned the battlefield, with an emotional part of him mourning the loss of Uranus, as even though Duke was still bitter by her shocking and unexpected betrayal towards him, he had personally wanted to redeem and save Uranus via his own lingering and personal feelings towards her. When the third Toshindaibukai was announced, Duke entered solely to not only fight Eiji once again, but to also help himself and his fellow Toshinden fighters out, due to the fact that he was targeted by old enemies of his family, the Soshiki, to be a blood sacrifice for the fallen fighting god, Agon Teos. During the tournament, Duke was stopped by a rival knight named Balga, who had a score to settle with him. Balga had descended from a lineage of Norse invaders who soon became the knights of Normandy since their arrival on France's shores, and his family were known to be sworn enemies of the Rambert clan since the days of Francia and the Viking Age, having been thwarted time and time again by them, and retreated to Norway since the assimilation of Normandy into France's sovereignty. However, Duke managed to slay Balga in combat. After hearing that Eiji had slain the leader of the Soshiki, Abel from within their own fight, Duke had retired from fighting for good, and settled down as a rich nobleman in France. Duke had also took in and trained an English boy named Lancelot Lakeknight as his apprentice for the fourth Toshindabukai.Battle Arena Toshinden 3 Ending  The evil Organization crumbled before Duke's mighty swordsmanship, and failed miserably in its attempt to destroy the Rambert family.

Tracy, being a skilled fighter, was narrowly defeated by a Japanese swordsman named Eiji Shinjo, but she eventually found the answers she needed: the now-dead Uranus was the one responsible for the deaths of Gaia's wife and son. Tracy had returned to New York and reported to her superiors about the case, being personally satisfied in having to complete it from within her own given time and accord. After the announcement of the third Toshindaibukai, Tracy had entered once again (not because of the thrill, but rather because of a new investigation and upon learning that she was targeted by the Soshiki to being a blood sacrifice for Agon Teos). At first she just couldn't get along with her new boss and partner Nagisa Iwashiro - everything he did grated on her nerves. But as they fought side by side against Abel and his cohorts, Tracy's feelings changed as she noticed Nagisa's strong sense of justice. Finally, he won her whole-hearted respect. Eventually Tracy was confronted by a Soshiki assassin named Rachael, who was Tracy's older twin sister. Abandoned by her parents and left to fend for herself in a cruel and harsh world, Rachael had cursed her fate and learned to hate Tracy, but Tracy had still defeated her from within their emotional battle against each other. In the end, Tracy had pleaded for Rachael to forget about the past and start all over with her, but Rachael had refused the request and left, never to be seen again.

But as they fought side by side against Abel and his cohorts, Tracey's feelings changed as she noticed Nagisa's strong sense of justice. Finally, he won her whole-hearted respect.

Abandoned by her parents at a young age, Rachael was left to fend for herself as a homeless street urchin from within a cruel and harsh world and because of this, she grew up having a cold and bitter personality. As a teenager, Rachael began fighting in the tough and dangerous streets of New York City and in due time, she had gained quite an infamous reputation as most people had soon feared her, due to her violent and unforgiving temper. A few years later, Rachael had made a shocking discovery in learning that she had a young twin sister named Tracy who was living a normal and decent life with the same parents who had abandoned her in the first place, causing a strong amount of uncontrollable hatred to build up from within Rachael's own heart. In due time, Rachael's ruthless street fighting had gotten the attention of a man named Abel, who had easily saw the relentless ferocity coming from within her. He told Rachael that she could get her revenge against Tracy if she was to work for him as an asssassin of the Soshiki. Without any hesitation or second thought, Rachael had accepted Abel's offer and began training herself in order to learn all of her sister's signature moves and techniques. When the third Toshindaibukai had begun, Rachael had confronted Tracy from within their match and told her that she had truly and personally hated her due to the fact that she was put through a living nightmare while Tracy was given a normal and decent life. Even though she saw and realized that Rachael had wanted to kill her upon sight, Tracy could not bring herself to do the same thing to her own sister and that she had spared her life right after the end of their own tough and emotional fight against each other. As Rachael had looked on in a complete state of both shock and disbelief, Tracy had explained to her that she had wanted nothing more than to restore their lost twin sister bond with one another and that she had offered Rachael a chance to come back with her to New York in order to start all over, but Rachael had refused the request and walked away from Tracy, never to be seen again.

He is the only character in the series who does not wield a weapon and instead fights using his own bare fists.Character History  Abel is the leader of the Soshiki: a rival organization of\u00a0Master's Himitsu Kessha. Abel was an avid worshiper of Agon Teos, whom he believed to be the Toshin: the God of Fighting. Abel's plan was to revive Agon Teos using the blood of powerful warriors and give him a human body. He had sent out\u00a0Vermilion\u00a0to the second Toshindabukai to gather information about the Toshinden fighters and see if their blood could be used for the ritual. Although Vermilion was discovered and defeated by\u00a0Sho Shinjo, he was successful nonetheless. With the information, Abel concluded that they were powerful enough. For the human body, Abel had chosen an English teenage boy named\u00a0David, whose parents were killed by Abel and his forces. During his time at the orphanage, David was attacked by Abel and that the Soshiki had attempted to capture him from within their own time, but David was able to escape from them and sought refuge with a Japanese gambler named\u00a0Shizuku Fuji. To complete the ritual of bringing back Agon Teos, Abel had decided to hold the third Toshindabukai and draw out the blood sacrifices into his own trap. However, the Toshinden fighters were more powerful than Abel had expected and that they easily killed most of his followers. Abel himself was eventually confronted by\u00a0Eiji Shinjo\u00a0who, after a long battle, managed to defeat and kill Abel. With Abel's death, the Soshiki had fallen and most of its warriors were slain, except Vermilion, who would later rise again to participate in the fourth Toshindabukai held by Eiji.Move Lists  Unlike the rest of the weapon-wielding Toshinden fighters, Abel utilizes both punches and kicks.

Even though she had served the group's leader, Master, with no question, Uranus had sought to overthrow her and become the new leader of the organization. Prior to joining the Himitsu Kessha, Uranus was an ordinary woman and the girlfriend of Duke B. Rambert. When she learned that Gaia: one of her co-workers, had hosted the first Toshinden tournament behind the Himitsu Kessha's back in order to start a rebellion, she declared him a traitor and marked him for death. However, Gaia escaped and went into hiding. Uranus had then sent him an invitation to the second tournament in an attempt to lure him out. Although Gaia had indeed entered, Uranus was eventually killed, along with Master, by Sho Shinjo who had confronted them at their headquarters.

He is a ninja warrior spy from a feared yet revered Japanese warrior clan.Character History  Mondo had entered the first Toshindaibukai in order to collect information about the Himitsu Kessha for his unkown client. Even though he was defeated during the tournament, he had gathered enough information on them. Just as his client was about to attack the Himitsu Kessha, Mondo received an invitation to the second Battle Arena Toshinden. As a way to retaliate, his client tried to hold Mondo back, telling him to discard the invitation. Mondo ignored the restraint and headed for the tournament without the consent of his client. Although he lost, the Himitsu Kessha fell right after the conclusion of the second Toshindabukai. Unknown to Mondo however, he had been selected by Abel to be a blood sacrifice for Agon Teos: a dark fighting god. When he learned of this, Mondo entered into the third tournament and killed Toujin, one of the Soshiki's assassins. Ten years later after the fall of the Soshiki, Eiji Shinjo became the head of the Gerard Foundation and when he learned about the power of the 4 Sacred Arms, he decided to find Mondo, since he carried the spear of Seiryu. Mondo was also targeted by an evil Chinese magician named Genma, who also sought the power of the 4 Sacred Arms. During an unknown past battle, Mondo was gravely injured and could barely aid himself in his own predicament, but within time, Mondo would get some unexpected help in the form of a young fisherman named Fen Barefoot and his grandfather. During his recovery, Mondo had showed his gratitude towards Fen by teaching him a couple of his spear moves and techniques. After regaining his strength, Mondo would bid farewell to his two new friends and leave Fen and his grandfather in his own accord, not knowing that Genma was following his path in secrecy and that it would lead to the death of Fen's grandfather, which prompted Fen himself to enter into the fourth tournament so that he could attempt to defeat Genma and avenge his grandfather's death. It is assumed that Eiji got to Mondo first, since Eos (one of Eiji's fighters) fought with his spear in the fourth Toshindabukai.Game Endings Battle Arena Toshinden 2  The descendant of a warrior family, the only time Mondo can express himself is in battle. His face a blank, he threw himself into combat, heeding nothing but the call of destiny. Victory in the Toshinden Battle Arena is sweeter to this fighting machine than success in any of his previous battles.\ufeffBattle Arena Toshinden 3  Mondo staked the honor of his family and its very survival on this fight. Despite his skill and tremendous strength the battle was not easy. He managed to defeat the Organization and scatter its followers, but the things he had lost could never be replaced. Once again, Mondo must return to his life as a spy, wrapping himself in the cloak of darkness. Wherever trouble arises, he and his clan are sure to be close by, slipping silently in the shadows.Voice Actors Chaos Description  Chaos  (\u0b92\u0bb4\u0bc1\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bbf\u0ba9\u0bcd\u0bae\u0bc8) is a fictional, playable character in the second and third installments of the Battle Arena Toshinden video game series. Up until Toshinden 4 (Toshinden Subaru), Chaos had possessed one of the Four Sacred Arms, namely the Genbu Shield.Character History  Chaos was one of the executives of the Himitsu Kessha, sharing equal footing with Gaia and Uranus. However, in her bid to assume even more power, Uranus had suggested for Chaos to be the guinea pig in an experiment to artificially augment the human body and brain. While Chaos' natural fighting skills were enhanced, the experience had unexpectedly shattered his mind and drove him completely insane. Despite his broken psyche, his position among the top four was still held. When Gaia had illegally held his own Toshindaibukai in an attempt to start a rebellion against the Himitsu Kessha, Chaos had no issue with his mutiny, but Uranus had declared Gaia a traitor and brainwashed Chaos to assassinate him. After the downfall of the Secret Society, Uranus' brainwashing soon broke, with Chaos now free of their influences. However, with the vacuum of power left behind as the Secret Society crumbled, Chaos soon felt the presence of a new evil arising in the world, and left to discover the Organization executing their plans to take over. While still left mentally unstable and with a lust to kill, Chaos had confronted and killed the master ritualist Schultz from within the third Toshinden and had also helped in the downfall of the Organization. During the events of the fourth tournament, the evil Chinese magician Genma possesses the shield once carried by Chaos, indicating a high probability that he was killed by him.Battle Arena Toshinden 3 Ending  Even now that he has crushed the Organization, Chaos, a long time enemy from the Secret Society feels neither joy nor sorrow. For him, battle is nothing more than a game. The fact that this game ended with the loss of the Organization is meaningless to him. The only thing that is important to Chaos is experiencing the joy of battle and the pleasure of the kill. This would not change even if he could remember his past. The look in his eyes when he fights tells all - pure insanity.Voice Actors Trivia Miss Til Description  Miss Til  is a fictional, playable character in the third installment of the Battle Arena Toshinden video game series. She made her first and only appearance in Battle Arena Toshinden 3, as an unlockable counterpart to Shizuku Fuji, with a similar moveset to her, although her attacks are slightly more damaging.Character History  Miss Til is a fortune teller who serves under Abel in the Soshiki as his third-in-command. Also, as both Abel's personal fortune teller and confidant, Miss Til has been there to give him very helpful advice and strategies about his own detailed and intricate plans so that he can execute them with no problem. As a fighter, Miss Til is very ruthless and doesn't hesitate to eliminate any threat that goes against the Soshiki. In a closed meeting one day, Abel tells his top three commanders (Vermilion, Miss Til, Schultz) about his plan to bring Agon Teos to the Earth and that he entrusts all three of them to initiate their own important roles from within the plan with no setbacks or problems. While Schultz was in charge of the ritual ceremony via his assigned role as the master ritualist and Vermilion was in charge of gathering and leading the assassins as their field commander, Miss Til was in charge of obtaining the past dossier files of the Toshinden fighters so that she could show them to Abel in an instant, enabling the two of them to analyze and determine the strengths and weaknesses of each fighter which would then allow them to give direct and absolute instructions to the assassins on how to fight and defeat their specific targets upon sight. At the third Toshindaibukai tournament, Miss Til had decided to participate in the event so that she could give Abel the time needed for the ritual ceremony. Eventually from within the tournament, Miss Til had found herself encountering and facing off against Shizuku Fuji: a Japanese female gambler who was protecting the potential vessel for Agon Teos, named David. Determined to fulfill her master's desire, Miss Til had fought against Shizuku with both her strength and power, but in the end, it had proved to be quite futile as Shizuku was successful in slaying Miss Til. Ironically, Miss Til had secretly foreseen her own death prior to the tournament and realized that she would inevitably die before the conclusion of the event, but despite this troubling revelation, Miss Til was still determined to fulfill her assigned mission, regardless of her own predestined fate.Move Lists  Miss Til is Shizuku's counterpart but some of her moves such as one of her special attacks, her Overdrive and her Soul Bomb are different which she releases two large butterfly projectiles as opposed to Shizuku's Soul Bomb when executed. Her weapon is a large flute as opposed to Shizuku's large kiseru.Special Attacks Overdrive Secret Move Desperation Move ", "BattleBlock Theater Wiki": "BattleBlock Theater Wiki The Behemoth  The Behemoth is an independent game developer company, founded by Tom Fulp (Action Scripter) and Dan Paladin (Game artist) in 2002.

Bring 5 Yarn to the security Cat Guard in the Gift Shop inside the portal. In exchange, he will bestow a random Weapon for the player. Weapons can be equipped on the Character Customization screen. Each weapon has its own merits and uses. Obviously, most Weapons' purposes are to damage enemy (such as igniting or blowing others up). However, some others can be used to help traverse a level, such as providing a platform or a large jump. These weapons tend to be much safer and helpful for completing a level, but are virtually useless on modes where you must actually kill others. Lastly, there is the miscellaneous group. These Weapons are vastly different from every other weapon, as they provide benefits no other group does. This includes reflecting/absorbing projectiles or freezing the opponent. These weapons tend to be hit or miss; some are good, some are bad. Below is a list of Weapons a player can obtain.Group 1  Weapons inside of Group 1 are mainly used for offense.Group 2  Weapons inside of Group 2 are mainly used for productivity.Group 3  Weapons inside of Group 3 are Utility, As they aren't for attack nor MobilityTrivia See Also BattleBlock Theater  BattleBlock Theater (Formely known as Game 3) is a 2D platformer created by The Behemoth.Story  The Player(s) and his best friend, Hatty Hattington, are off on an adventure one fine day when they become shipwrecked on an island. The friends seek shelter inside an old, abandoned theater, where they discover a hat. Hatty tries it on, and through some magic he becomes a truly terrible person. The cats that inhabit the island take the Player(s) and shackle them, dragging them away to the prison to entertain their pride pitting them and the prisoners against one another. Hatty, even changed by the strange hat, is their sometimes unwilling leader... The Player and the prisoners must do whatever they can to escape, and in the process hopefully sever the connection between Hatty and the hat!Gameplay  Players create a character using shapes and different face styles and give them a weapon to use, and control them using a simple control system of running, jumping, punching, and firing a weapon. Punching dazes an opponent whilst jumping on their head kills them. Players on the same team can stand on each others heads and help their teammates up ledges. Different weapons have different effects, ranging from explosive devices to effect inducing objects. Levels shown featured different types of blocks, including ones that self-destruct and ones with spikes, as well as hazards such as water and laser cannons. Power-ups include wings that allow players to fly around the level and jackpacks that boost the players to unreachable locations. In adventure mode, there can be two to four players, and each level requires the collection of a certain number of gems to complete. There is also a hidden ball of yarn in each level for some extra fun. Players can use their moves together to solve puzzles; since there isn't a death penalty on using them on your friends, you can also elect to throw them into boiling lava from time to time. Gemstones are later used to free (unlock) the over 300 prisoners. The unlock process is random, however, with each turn-in. There are also a handful of arenas players can participate in, either co-op or versus, and unlockable achievements.Development  Dan Paladin has stated that the things such as the mini-games and character selection weren't final. At San Deigo Comic Con 2009, the game, under its working title \"Game #3\", was shown to have online gameplay with up to 16 players in up to 4 teams. The final game will also have a single player story mode. Whilst not a lot is known about the main game itself, it appears to revolve around the collection of gems. Like their previous game, Castle Crashers, there are plans to feature user-generated music from Newgrounds audio portal. At the Tokyo Game Show, The Behemoth announced the game would definitely be making its way to Xbox Live Arcade, though were unable to say at the time if the game would be released for other formats. A second trailer was released on February 1, 2010, revealing the final name for the game to be BattleBlock Theater.Trivia External links Monaco-sidebar Characters  Only a few characters are known at this point, they are...The Player  The player and his friends (including Hatty, the greatest friend of all who gave everyone flowers earlier in the day) were sailing on the S.S. Friendship, until a harsh storm shipwrecked them on an unknown island. Seeking shelter, the Player showed up just in time to see the Cats force Hatty to put on Perhams Hat. The player is then sent through various deadly obstacle courses throughout the game, which make up the levels of Battleblock Theater. The player seems to possess a strong will, going through the increasingly-ridiculous levels without complaining once. Finally, the player makes it through the Vault and rescues Hatty, before then escaping the island altogether. The player can be any prisoner they've rescued from the Gift Shop, though cutscenes show them as the default round head (known in the Steam inventory as Mom).Hatty Hattington  The player's best (and most attractive) friend who was given a glowing red hat, and according to the narrator, \"Ooh that's bad. Glowing red things are always bad.\" He seems to be the captain of the boat. Hatty later becomes corrupted by the hat and the gems he can make from the theater and becomes its owner, leading the cats. He does nothing but sit in his office among a pile of gems. In the end, Hatty did not pay attention or maintenance to the staff of the theater, the cats, so they became very disorganized and angry. They rebelled and destroyed the theater. Hatty at this point seemed lifeless (like a doll) and did not respond to anyone around him. This is because of the conflict between the souls of the hat, and the trauma that Hatty has been through and has witnessed his friends go through, making him emotionally torn (Hence the constant stream of tears) and putting him in a catatonic state. The player brings him aboard the boat, but is unable to make him respond. Shortly after the song \"You Were My Hattington\", a large wave knocks him off the boat as Buckle Your Pants starts playing. After the song is finished, he's shown sinking to the bottom of the ocean, only for the hat to land on his head again. Instead of glowing red, it glows green this time. Hatty yells \"NO!\" several times, before a huge laser is shot out of the hat and into the sky. Amongst other things, it hits the S.S. Friendship, a plane, and a bird before hitting a giant space bear. The game then returns to the title screen, without explaining what happened.Cat Guards  They are the cats who run the theater. They wear brown uniforms that resemble real life guards. They stand taller than the player, and are relatively fat. Their exact origins are unknown, and not even the Narrator is sure where they came from, though they're shown acting as performers back in the days when Purrham Furbottom ran the theater. In the present day, they seem to have gone insane. They rule over the bleak, decaying theater with an iron fist, forcing the prisoners to go through increasingly difficult challenges for their own monetary gain. The cats bear a huge love for Golden Yarn, and will give any prisoner who can bring them five Golden Yarns a new weapon. When Hatty proves to be an inept manager, they start rioting and causing even worse damage to the theater, before finally attempting to kill Hatty and find someone else to take his place. At the end of the game, the prisoners manage a breakout, and several cats are shot dead as the S.S. Friendship leaves. It remains unknown if there were any survivors.Prisoners  Hatty has enslaved the rest of your friends and has made you compete, fight, and you and them must work together to survive the deadly performances for amusement. They are other prisoners locked up in the Gift Shop, which you can unlock for an increasing rate starting at 10 gems. They serve as customization for the Player.The Narrator  The Narrator talks to you throughout the game with many different phrases, such as \"Milk, milk, lemonade, get that hat so you'll get paid\" and \"Don't get zapped by those things. Some people poop themselves and die. In that order!\" He also narrates cutscenes, and apparently is the one controlling the cutscenes stick puppets. He also sings the \"Buckle Your Pants\" song and can be turned off in the settings menu.Purrham Furbottom  Purrham Furbottom was a self-made millionaire, who lived in the year \"17095-ish\", according to the Narrator. Having amassed a fortune, he built a new attraction: Battleblock Theater. The theater stared deadly stage performances, the likes of which the world had never seen before. It was a huge success, raking in enormous amounts of money for Purrham. However, for unknown reasons, Furbottom hated intermissions with a burning passion, and didn't allow them in the theater. He sat there for days on end, gorging himself on popcorn and never taking a potty break. This ultimately proved his downfall. Furbottom tragically pooped himself to\u00a0 death while running to the bathroom. According to the Narrator, he \"tried to hold it in, but his little cheeks just couldn't handle it\". After his death, the cats threw his foul-smelling body into the ocean, where it was immediately devoured by sharks. He left behind nothing but his theater, his cats, and his top hat.Wiki.png Monaco.css  /***** Edit this file to customize the Monaco 'custom' theme.

It's not meant to be updated, but left to see what the game was like in the past. Do feel free to start a new page for the current environment.General Ships and Fleets Base Design  A base is never indestructable, but you should try and make it as hard as possible to hit so that potential attackers will go after easier targets.\nAll bases should: xxxxxx = Land xxxxxx = Tile ---------- = Water ---------- = Tile So far the best base layout that included all these is the spiral but with the latest changes in weapon range changes and that islands are now allowed, there are many other types of bases slowly appearing.Why protect Outpost and warehouses? Ship weapon range and Landfill/seafills  Range of weapons is about it radius, not diameter. And mortar must be able to target the middle of the building before shooting, therefore do not put walls in the inner island as mortars can target walls and splash damage your OP. (I'd like to see this verified as the last few base attacks I've made, I've been unable to target walls just the buildings/turrets) (Also, needing to be checked is if the target has to be in range of the middle of the building or the edge. The information on the kixeye forums states that the change is it now has to reach the edge of a building, not the middle of it)Threats to base Base Planning Abreviations  The best layout for Outpost 3, 4, & 5 are different due to the amount of land tiles & amount of buildings available per OP level. A player can however take future outpost layouts in consideration when designing their current base layout, which can make the redesign easier in the future.Building Repair Times  Repair times for buildings varies depending on the building & building level. The higher the level of the building the longer it will take for it to be fully repaired. This also applies to defensive platforms as well. In some cases certain buildings like the Great Hall can be repaired instantly.Damage Protection  Damage Protection: Is NOT determined by the amount of buildings destroyed vs the total amount of buildings you have. Instead it IS determined by the health of the buildings destroyed to your overall base health. This makes it extremely difficult to determine what needs to be destroyed in during a prep wave attack to give you a bubble since we can't see what a buildings health number is. With this in mind you want to place your RG's with the highest level near the beginning of where an attacker needs to go to get to your WH & OP. This way you'll have a better chance of getting a DP bubble. Maximizing your RG's to your OP's level & placing non essintial large buildings near the front will also help contribute in you getting a 25% DP bubble during a prep wave attack. NOTE: Try to avoid being attacked in the first place by trying to act friendly to the players in your sector. If there is someone one attacks you consecutively, put your best defenses to the direction their base is to yours to improve your chances of a succesful defend.Sacrificial Buildings  Always Sacrificial: Oil Rig, Metal Foundry, Wind Turbine, Zynthium Refinery, War Academy, Shipyard, Intelligence Lab, Great Hall, Radio Tower, Trading Post. Pretty much anything else that is a low level. Sacrificed During Special Circumstances: These buildings should only be sacrificed when they are not researching or not being used: Weapons Lab, Advanced Lab, & Naval Lab. If you have an area with your OP & WH's that was being used to protect labs while upgrading, you can move the Launch Pad there once your labs are all level 10 to protect your rockets. If the launch pad is destroyed, it takes a long time to repair and longer if it is holding a rocket; however, any rockets that may have been ready to use will not be destroyed.Buildings to Protect Defense Priorities Guarding Bases Player Farms  Farming is the process where other players rob you of your riches regularly.How to Stop/Prevent Farming Mining vs Salvages vs Base Hitting Base Setup and Defense 101  Follow these tips and you will be able to create a formidable fortress and hold on to your resources.Friendly bubbles  If two (or more) players \"attack\" and then \"retreat\" without doing each others bases any damage, after a certain number of attacks, you get a bubble. note: this doesn't require you to do any damage to each other. but two things you need to know to do it right. If more than two people want to bubble, pick one to hit each person, doing them one at a time, and just moving to the next after the 10th attack on them. then on the last person they bubble, they have that person hit them at the same time on the 10th hit so everyone has a 2 day bubble. Also note this is why if attacking to kill a base and you enter and leave to many times it will bubble... you may not have been the first one there! Alternatively, you can get your friends to hit your base enough to trigger damage protection. However this tactic is very wimp-like. And will get you made fun of in your sector.High level base Design (18+)  Drag-n-Drop Base Build Simulator Curtis Smale published some really good base designs on the Battle Pirates Forum.

When you defeat Draconian Salvage fleets or Draconian fleets guarding resource depots you receive resources and can find Draconian Blueprint parts. These blueprint parts are collected in the intelligence center and give you access to Draconian weapons when the blueprint is complete and the requirements are met. One method that always works for salvage fleets levels 1-21 and resources 1-29, and sometimes higher: Four Submarines with Havok Torpedoes4, No armor, Engine Upgrade1 or higher, (if you have Shipyard2, use ...) and some small, fast and easy repairable ship. The key to this is to start with one sub to get used to the timing, and then move to the four-ship fleet. In the battle, turn your ships around, and time their movements so that they stay just ahead of the drac fleets. If you can target the drac ships with missiles, do it; after they're all sunk, you have a lot more leeway when controlling your fleet. Proven tactic, very simple and widely used. Masarykoi 18:03, December 20, 2011 (UTC) If you don't like controlling your ships a good rule to keep in mind is: \"Don't hit if it won't fit.\" Make sure your cargo is equal or greater than the salvage drop. Note: The resource dropped is divided between the four resources with slightly more metal than oil, slightly more energy than metal and slightly more zynthium than energy. As of 26/6-2012 the levels displayed on salvages and mines changed: The formula for for converting old levels into new: Old = (New+3)/4Level 1-9 (formerly level 1-3)Fleets  The Fleet Makeup: Lv1: 3 Drac Gunboats Lv5: 3 Drac Skirmishers Lv9: 1 Destroyer + 4 Drac Skirmishers --- Strategies:Level 13 Fleets  {C}Level 13 fleets consists of 3 destroyers sized and 2 drac skirmishers. (The official names of the skirmisher-like ships and gunboat-like ships have not been announced. All other drac ship names are taken from their names given as raid prizes.) Use ships with heavy splash damage. Or a marauder fleet with instant repair. Alternatively, use a fleet of five battle barges, each with four Thud IV, and at least HB1. This will auto-attack with zero damage. Drops resources in the 100,000 - 200,000 range .Level 17 Fleets  Consists of 3 Light Cruisers and 2 destroyers. Apparently one destroyer has impact cannons; the other, strike missles. One of the Light Cruisers has Firestorm/Assault rockets. Another has Assault Cannons & Shockwave Mortars, like LCs from higher-level fleets. The third has Strike/Assault Missiles. [This weapon description, or that of any other salvage level, can be corrected if someone knows better.] This is a good level of salvage for auto-attacking. Their fleets are relatively weak and have low damage against leviathan/seawolf tier ships, or espescially ships more powerful than that. Drops resources in the 300,000 - 400,000 range.Level 21 Fleets  The old turn and run with mortars is very effective here. Just note that the 2 Light Cruisers, being faster than the Battleships, should be the trigger for your mortar firing. (Always have the red target icon locked onto the closest ship while kiting with mortars.) If you destroy the 2 mortar ships, then you will face the three Battlecruisers- which have Assault Rockets/Missiles. You need engine1 and thruster2 so that you can turn faster at the edge of map. Strategy: Have several ships with mortars, turn the ships to face away from the oncoming Draconian Ships, then when at the edge of your Mortar range start moving your ships towards the edge of the map. This way the Draconian Ships will move into your falling Mortars. When near the edge of the map turn one ship up or down & have the others stop. Most of the lead ships will follow the one turning, allowing your others to follow parallel & dealing damage destroying the remaining Draconian Ships. Drops around 500,000 - 750,000 resourcesLevel 25 Fleets  This fleet is comprised of four light cruisers and one Battleship. Armed almost exclusively with mortars Method 1: Direct assault with fast hulls with engines and strong armor. These Draconian fleets have weak short range defences, so if you succeed in getting close to them fast, they won't have time to hurt you bad and have no defense against your strong short range weapons. This also works on level 8 fleets. No doubt direct assult is a good way, but the repair cost and time maybe a bit high as the Light Cruisers may have Assault Cannons. Method 2: Kiting the 4 Light Cruisers first, then circling the battleship with a fast combat speed and long range weapons. (Mortars can't hit ships moving at a certain speed or above, because they take time in the air.) Method 3: Use 3 or more predator subs to ambush the 4 Light Cruisers, then kite the battleshiip with the subs. Engine 1 is required to out run the Light Cruisers and their mortars. Gives around 1,100,000 - 1,400,000 in resources.Level 29 Fleets  Level 8 fleets are only for high levelers, (25+) but are extremly worthwhile to really stock up on resources. They appear beside players who are lvl 28 to 31 Level 8 fleets are notoriously difficult because they have a Dreadnaught with 8 siege mortars. The best way of dealing with these is using your own big ships, your FF`s (Floating Fortresses), a sea wolf and a SS (Stalker Submarine). send your 3 FFs turning around to head away from the draconians, while your SS and your sea wolfcircle around out of range. When the draconians reach your FFs, speed the sea wolf and SS into the back of them, and, with your SS armed with rippers and your sea wolf armed with max level HR (Hydra Rockets) and watch as the Draconian fleet is bombarded with 30 Rockets! Another tactic uses 2 seawolfs armed thuds with hardened barrels 3, no armour and engine upgrade 2 and 2 subs engine upgrade2 no armour.. Picks off the 2 Light Cruisers with the subs and then slaughter the battlecruiser and dreadnaught with the seawolfs, this can be done fast and very often without damage. No armour equals less repair time and costs. Tactic 3 is to use a seawolf fleet with cutlasses and/or assault missiles. Use SFB2 or 3 and lasers as specials. Come in from the SW and immediately turn. You will outrange all their weapons, so wait till the first ship is in range then move slowly away from them to keep firing continuously. You can also take this out without taking damage using a fleet of 4 subs (if predator use any level of engine). Take out the faster ships first (watchout for the short range ones as it will allow all the other fleets to fire there missiles and mortars at you). Then once they are sunk use a sort of hit and run tactic on the dreadnaught as it uses mortars that fire in a smaller ark than any of the others. gives around 2,000,000 resourses.Level 33 Fleets  Level 33 (formerly level 9) fleets appear beside players who are lvl 32 to 35 These fleets consist solely of Battleships. Some appear to have engine upgrade since they don't travel at the same speed. The ships are armed with a mix of (siege missles or siege mortars) and (seige rockets or siege cannons). One of the easiest ways is to use submarines. Park your submarines right before they submerge and move only when the close combat based ships come too close as they can scan out your position. If your subs have Ion Thrusters installed on them you can repeatedly do hit-and-run tactics on the long-range ships. If your subs have level 2 or 3 engine upgrades, you can just continuously circle mortar based ships but make sure your ships are stacked or really close. Or use a seawolf missile fleet, see tactic 3 above for level 8. Level 33 Draconian Salvage fleet drops resources in the 4 million range with slightly more zynthium.Level 37 Fleets  Level 37 (formerly level 10) fleets appear beside players who are lvl 36 or above. Use seawolf fleet with missiles and SFB3, same as level 8, tactic 3 Level 37 Draconian Salvage fleet drops resources in the 8-9 million range.Buildings Information Additional Facts Ship Specials \u00a0 \u00a0  ---- Both Ship Specials and Base Specials can be researched in the Advanced Lab or accessed via Blueprints gained through events. Specials you have gained through events can be found under the \"Advanced\" tab in your Intelligence Lab. Ship Specials are applied to modify the weapons, armor, or other characteristics of ships. They are installed onto Hulls from within the Shipyard. The Ships Specials are sorted below into Armor, Weapons, Hull, and Systems Specials.Armor Specials  These specials increase the ship's resistance to one or more types of damage from attacker's weapons.Reactive Armor (RA)  Reduces damage from Penetrating Weapons (Missile Weapons). NOT ON ROCKETS such as Hydra Rockets. Only one type of special armour is permitted on each ship (Including compound armour). This is one of the few armours offering great protection from the dreaded Halo defence missile.Ablative Armor (AA or ABL)  Reduces damage from explosive weapons (mortar and rockets). \u200bLayered Armor (LA)  Reduces damage from ballistic weapons (cannons). \u200bCompound Armor  Zynthium-based armor forged using advanced Draconian technology that provides additional protection bonusses against all types of weapons. Awarded during the Revenge Raid V - Base Invaders, Storm Strike and Drac Hunt events.Alloy Armor: CX Series  An advanced Draconian armor alloy that prevents weapon penetration, providing additional protection from\u00a0Ballistic\u00a0 and explosive weapon types.Alloy Armor: MC Series  An advanced Draconian armor alloy that prevents weapon penetration, providing additional protection from missile and ballistic weapon types.Alloy Armor: MX Series  An advanced Draconian armor alloy that prevents weapon penetration, providing additional protection from missile and explosive weapon types.Heavy Plating Armor  refer to Heavy_PlatingHull Specials  These specials adjust hull characteristics such as speed and evasion.Guidance Scrambler  Increase ships' evasion ability during combat. Note that this is NOT limited to missiles in spite of the description. This does not work on damage caused by Mortars and does not protect from splash damage. Use GS's evade to protect against Torps, Cannons, and Missiles. \u200bEngine Upgrade  Increases ships' combat and map speed at the expense of weapon accuracy. Advised not to use Eng 3 on HH/FF without thrusters as the hulls get land locked and even more susceptible to attacks from mortars. Use Speed System III (SPD3 - a valued Drac print prize) instead on HHs & FFs. \u200bThrusters  Drastically increases ships' turn rate and\u00a0improves evasion during combat. \u200bSonar Pod  Increase the range at which a ship detects submarines and torpedoes.\u00a0\u00a0(SONAR:\u00a0SOund\u00a0Navigation\u00a0And\u00a0Ranging)Nautilus Battery  Increases the time a submarine stays submerged. \u200bCaterpillar Drive  Decreases the range at which opposing ships can detect your submarine. For foes with Sonar specials it drastically reduces the range of their Sonar detection. \u200bCargo Hold  Cargo hold was awarded to players who have collected a set amount of salvage from Draconian salvage fleets during the\u00a0Revenge Raid\u00a0event. It can now be found as blueprints. It increases your cargo capacity, which means you can carry additional resources. NOTE:Weapon Specials  These specials modify the effects of specific weapons or types of weapons equipped on the ship.Electronic Range Finder  Reduces the spread radius\u00a0of mortar and rocket based weapons concentrating their firepower\u00a0to a tighter radius.Enhanced Warhead  Increases damage from missile based weapons. \u200bLaser Targeting  Increases accuracy of missile based weapons AND allows missiles to hit submerged submarines if the missiles were fired while the subs are either surfaced or visible underwater*. \u00a0Re-targeting only affects missiles. \u200bAuto-loader  Reduces ballistic reload time. \u200bHigh Explosive Shells  Increases splash damage of any weapon with splash effect. \u200bCluster Warheads  Cluster Warheads reduce reload times for ship based rockets (Hydra, Maelstrom, Drac Rockets). They don't reduce missile reload. Originally they could only be won during the Storm Warning\u00a0event but have been made available during other events.\u00a0 They are also available as a 4-part blueprint drop.Hardened Barrels  Increases ballistic weapon range. Please note that HB III will add 60% to your weapon weight, and combined with Auto -Loader III will make Assault Cannons and Rippers IV extremely heavy, making them only fit on relatively large ships like the Hammerhead. A new Cannon System special (introduced early 2013) combines hardened barrels and auto-loader. \u200bSolid Fuel Booster  Increase missile weapon range. D53 missiles and SFB3 are a lethal, long-range combo, although if you don't have the blueprint unlocked Cut 3 can be used instead for the cost of less dps and range. Highly recommended to combine with Laser Upgrade 2-3.Concussion Warhead  Increases the damage of weapons that do concussive damage (most often torpedos).combusition system  insreases splash and projecttile speed of explosive weapons.Systems Specials  The Systems combine the effects of two other specials. They usually do not stack with the specials whose effects they duplicate.Stealth Attack System  An advanced system that improves the energy efficiency of submarine components, allowing for improved submerge time and torpedo firepower. \u200bCannon System III is equal to the combination of AL2 and HB2\u00a0  An advanced system that improves your cannons' load rates and reach. Cannon System III increases reload rate by 75% and ballistic range by 35%. It is a little less powerful than AL3 and HB3 combined, but this one Cannon Sys special occupies just the one slot on your ship -- a nice trade off.Missile System  Increase the range and accuracy of missiles.Strike System  An advanced electronic strike package that improves speed & missile range without accuracy loss. \u200bExplosive System  Details neededCombustion System  Details neededSpeed System  An advanced engine system that combines enhanced speed & turning capabilities. \u200bBlueprints Information Additional Facts Related Pages External Links Navigation  Coming Soon!Base Invaders Event Overview  \".Forsaken Intelligence confirms intense construction of new Draconian Outposts.

There are four main resources (Oil, Metal, Energy, and Zynthium) and one bonus resource (Gold). Other resources including Reputation Points and Medals. The amount of resources collected from salvage fleets, elite fleets,\u00a0 resources\u00a0mines and resource buildings will depend on the level of the Super Mine or fleet.Sources of resources  Resources can be gathered by attacking Draconian cargo fleets, super mines on the main map, collected from resource generators constructed within your base and taken from other players bases and fleets.Generators in Player Bases Dranconian Cargo Fleets in Map  Draconians mine resourses around the map and transport them to their world. Those cargo fleets are slow yet heavily guarded. There are 2 types of Draconian cargo fleets:Cargo Fleet level and Stats  This is a rough guide, the actual salvage fleet level is dependance on the level of bases surrounding a location. It seems that every base has 2 Cargo fleet every hour.Elite Cargo Fleet level and Stats  Note\u00a0: When breaking open a Cargo fleet, you will end up with:Player Bases  While the amount of resources collected from players will depend on the amount of resources they have on their fleet or within their base and the buildings destroyed and your attacking fleet cargo capacity.Mines  As of the Nov. 1, 2013 update, New Super Mines have been introduced and it is a random mine with a draconian outpost and guards guarding it. It gives out a lot more of a kind of resources at high levels at a faster rate. \"Draconian Mining Platforms Draconian Mining Platforms can be found near Draconian Bases. Low-level Platforms will be plentiful, high-level Platforms will be more rare. New Mining Platforms will display a counter that shows how long they will remain on the map. Destroying the Mining Platform will grant the player a bonus to all resources for the initial destruction. Once the Mining Platform is destroyed, a player can mine for the specific resource associated with the Platform up to 500% of their cargo capacity. Players can send a separate fleet to guard their mining fleet against enemies. If the player moves away from the Platform it will start to slowly lose the Resources inside it. When a Mining Platform is empty it will sink into the ocean.\" refer to https://www.kixeye.com/forum/discussion/410326 The super mines now have a timer on it, once 30 minutes is up and no one attacks it, old mines will sink and new mines will randomly appear.\u00a0Gold  With Facebook credits dieing when the Company became a PLC, Kixeye introduced the Gold system. Similar to Facebook Credits, the gold was awarded directly through Kixeye and is now a compensation tool for errors caused to players which can be placed at Kixeyes blame. Not all players get gold and many submit large numbers of tickets and get no rewards at all.Other Resources  Reputation Points MedalsShip Repairs Time to Repair  Ship repair times are based on the current health of the ship (current health = hull's armor points + armor points of all armors equipped). Mousing over a ship in the dock will show the ship's details = \"Ship Health: Full Health/Current Health\"Surface Ships  For surface ships 1 health point is equal to 1 second of repair. Formula for repair time:\u00a0(ship's full health minus current health) x seconds = repair time. Example: A ship has 40 health in full repair, and in its current state it has 10 health points. Calculate = (40-10) x seconds = 30 seconds to repair.Submarines  Submarines take four times as long to repair so 1 armor point is equal to 4 seconds of repair. Formula for repair time:\u00a0(ships full health minus current health) x 4 seconds = repair time. Example: A submarine with 40 health points in full repair, and a current health of 10 points. Calculate = (40-10) x 4 seconds = 120 seconds to repair. Predator subs with no armor have 120 health points, therefore it needs 8 minutes to repair or 7 minutes and 12 seconds if you have the repair officer assigned. Why do subs take so long to repair?Instant repair fleet  The last 5 minutes of repairing a ship are free if you repair just one of the ships in a fleet at a time. Ships of up to 300 health points (330 with an officer) can be repaired instantly using the free 5 minutes speed-up. Using 5 of such ships in a fleet, you can use about 10 secs to repair them. These fleets can be used to weaken fleets so that the main fleet can take less damage, and thereby reduce repair time for those big guns.Master Fixer Officer  Assigning a \"Master Fixer\" Officer in your Great Hall reduces repair times by 10%.Repair Time During Raids  During raid events, the repair times are reduced by 50%. Repair costs remain the same.\u00a0After the Raid events, repair times return to normal.What would be a good instant repair ship during raids?  During raids, the repair time is half, so any ship with 600 armor is instant repair (or 660 armor\u00a0with the Master Fixer Officer).I want to build an instant repair fleet, what kind of ship hull should I use?  That depends on the reason for the hull (Fleet vs Fleet or Raids) If FvF you are looking at a SW with missiles, if Raids, Scorpion with Ballistic is another great choice (but slightly high for instant repair).Resource Costs for Repair  The resource cost for repairing ships is based on all of the components in the ship. Draconian weapons and armor can be particularly expensive to repair. Repair costs can be important during raids when you don't want to spend time collecting resources to repair your fleets. The best approach to comparing resource costs is to use the Ultimate Shipyard (external link).Ship Rank  Thanks to the VXP repair reduction pack, ships rank affect repair times. By researching repair specialist in naval lab under specialists page you can enable this function for some hulls. Researching specialist is easy for everyone, all you need is hull in repair pack, 100 from each resource and 10 seconds time. Also a ship with a higher rank will have a higher repair cost. Why do Higher ranked ships need more resources to repair? Ship ranks give ships firing and turning speed bonuses so while the ships improve, they also get somewhat more costly to repair.Draconian Outposts  \u200bInformation  Draconian Outposts appeared during the Base Invaders events. They hugely differ in defense.\n Drac Outposts also appeared in the weekly Forsaken Missions. (December 2012 to September 2013) For pictures of ships and bases see this forum thread. The current table shows the points and resources you get when solo attacking an (unattacked, 100% health) outpost and destroy all ships and buildings. If there are\u00a0two attackers participating, the points are shared based on damage inflicted; so someone doing 80% of the work will receive 80% of the points. NOTE: Outposts changed for Base Invaders 6. Now defended by TORPEDO TOWERS. Fleets do follow your ships and don't stop in the middle which benefits most players as they can take the fleets out first.Points and Resources Aim and Target Table Target List  Missile Turrets: Howitzer Turrets: Torpedo Turrets: Note: Names of these turrets are have not been confirmed by kixeye. Thus the naming is only until more details are divulged about the turrets actual names.\n\n The outposts also have defending fleets which as of base defenders 6 now follow enemies. meaning that one can lead the fleet out of turret range and destroy them first.Player versus player  Players can attack any base within 5 levels of theirs. If their level is too far from yours, then it will say that its level is too low/high for you to attack. Ship combat does not suffer from this limitation. Ex. A level 15 player can attack a player that is level 10 up to a player that is level 20 & everything in between. NEEDS UPDATINGShip Combat  Unlike Base combat, Ship combat has no level restrictions, and so long as the ship is not moving, it can be attacked by other players. Upon engaging in combat both players are given notice that one of their fleets have entered combat, and given an option to \"join\" the fight or to \"hide\" the nofitication. Players typically \"join\" the fight so that they may both observe the battle and to control their fleets. The fleets are placed some distance apart & their map location depends on the attacking direction. Once the battle begins the fleets will automatically begin to engage each other. Each ship will stop moving when it reaches weapon range for the maximum distance of the longest range weapon equipped. Ex: You have a ship with Mortars & Thud Cannons the ship will stop at Mortar range, not Thud Cannon range. The battle ends when all of one player's ships have been destroyed. If both fleets are destroyed during the battle, it displays a defeat message and triggers a retreat response for both fleets. A draw occurs after 5mins, but only if both players still have active ships. If you accidentally engage a friendly target, both players should direct their fleets to turn around & head away from each other. Ship combat occurs when one fleet engages another fleet while the other fleet is either standing still, guarding a base, salvage, or resource when they try to attack it. When you have mortars equipped you can turn your ships around and moving in the opposite direction. By doing this you kite the enemy. To kite an enemy you keep his lead ship in your maximum attack range, while staying out of his attack range. That way when your mortar shells hit, they will damage all of the other players ships so you can win. See the video below. The Predator Submarine is a good counter to any ship with weapons that have a minimum range bigger than that of the havok torpedoes. The sub disappears, by the time it reappears its within the minimum range of the ship.  + Lighweight hull that can submerge itself underwater for a period of time. Great for sneak fleet attacks. This ship is refitable, can only be equiped with underwater weapons and can fire both surfaced and submerged. While the sub is submerged it is invulnerable to ship weapons (except missles when used with laser targetting) and invisible when far enough away. By carefully controlling a sub it is possible to defeat much stronger fleets. NB: The Predator Submarine cannot be a fleet flagship, so you cannot make fleets consisting purely of Predator Submarines. The Predator Submarine takes 4 seconds to repair 1 point of health, instead of just 1. Due to this, it's recommended you don't put armor on it.Base Combat  Base combat occurs when one player attacks anothers base. The initial combat starts with any fleets guarding the base, the attacking fleet engages any defending fleets seperately, following the rules of Ship Combat, above. After all defending fleets have been eliminated, or if there are no defending fleets, you engage in Base Combat. Your fleets will appear in 1 of 4 corners of the base, depending on the direction from which you engaged them, and the Battle Timer starts. Your ships appear as if they were in a sea battle, but instead of enemy ships the enemy base appears with all of their structures. Their turrets, resource mines, research, and other buildings are displayed, and can be attacked by your ships, which in turn can be attacked. Now the player defending the base can launch a fleet inside the base itself before the attacker attacks the base. You have 5 minutes to damage the base as much as you can, which is recorded by the Battle Timer at the top of the screen, after which the battle ends and the screen results display both what structures were destroyed and resources plundered from the enemy base. The amount of resources pillaged depends on both the amount of damage dealt to the base and what buildings were destroyed. If resource harvesters were destroyed, you gain the resources that were unbanked in the structures. Warehouses give you 10% of all stored resources when destroyed, and the outpost gives you 20% of all stored resources when destroyed. Ex: A player attacks a base with Outpost 5, & 5 warehouses. 3 Warehouses & the Outpost are destroyed. The attacking player gets 50% of the defending players stored resources, or as much as his fleet can hold up to 500% of his total cargo space. The best base attacking fleet consists of etheir FF's or HH's or any heavy armoured hull with a high resourses capacity, every ship should have full mortars or any other long range weapon although close range ballastic weapons should be attached to take out enemy ships that get to close or quickly destroy close turrents. Every ship should have the best armour you have available to you, Special slots should be either ship speed to out run mortar shells from victory mortars or to increase the range and or damage of the weapons on board the ships you could also increase the armour by reactive armor or other similar specials.Is Base Attack/farming always successful?  No. Base attack and farming is not to be taken lightly, some high level players even have recon and prep fleets before the real attack. The success of the attack depends on a lot of factors:Revenge Raid Event Overview  \"Forsaken Intelligence has detected increased Draconian radio chatter surrounding an event of unknown proportions on October 21st.\" - Event DescriptionEvent Objective  The objective of the event is to loot as many Draconian Salvage Fleets as your can in a 24 hour period. This is helped by a massive number of salvage fleets spawning all around the map as well as those salvage fleets respawn timer being about 30 minutes. During the Raid, your ships' repair rate will be doubled. We've learned the Draconians will again be distributing massive amounts of resources in Forsaken territory. Their motivation is unclear at this time, but we must not ignore their re-doubled efforts. Seize as much loot as you can.Event Prizes Facebook Event Link Video Navigation  HUB Event REVENGE RAID SERIES Revenge Raid \u2022 Revenge Raid II \u2022 Revenge Raid III \u2022 Revenge Raid IV BASE INVADERS SERIES Base Invaders \u2022 Base Invaders II \u2022 Base Invaders III \u2022 Base Invaders IV \u2022 Base Invaders V \u2022 Base Invaders VI STORM SERIES Storm Warning \u2022 Storm Strike \u2022 Storm Force LIGHTNING SERIES Lightning Run \u2022 Lightning Raid \u2022 Lightning Fall DRAC HUNT SERIES Drac Hunt \u2022 Drac Hunt 2 \u2022 Drac Hunt 3 \u2022 Drac Hunt 4 DRAGON's SERIES Dragon's Nest \u2022 Dragon's Nest 2 \u2022 Dragon's Grip \u2022 Dragon's Grip 2 FORSAKEN FURY SERIES Forsaken Fury \u2022 Forsaken Fury 2 BURNING SEA SERIES - (Reaver Introduction) Burning Seas \u2022 Trial by Fire \u2022 Infernal Onslaught \u2022 Reign of Fire WARZONE SERIES - (Reaver vs. Dracs) Riptide \u2022 Deathstroke \u2022 Tempest \u2022 The Reckoning ARCTIC SERIES Snowblind \u2022 Frostbite \u2022 Whiteout \u2022 Hailstorm \u2022 AvalanceBase Defenses Defense  REDIRECT Base DefencesBasic Knowledge  This section is about some important basic knowledge in the game of Battle Pirates.General The Battle Pirate World  The world of Battle Pirates is a very big map that is made up of different sectors.Can I Play BP on my Droid/Droid Tablet and or android/iphone?  Yes & No. . Then, you'll need to download a flash browser onto your device for it to work. Yes you can. Rather than loading Facebook through an App, you have to navigate to FB through a browser, then you can play BP. You don't need a jailbroken or rooted device. I use puffin free for the 7 day trial if i really need to use it. But mainly use Photon flash browser. 5$ on I device and i think 3$ on Android. Works a charm. Little time to get used to but it works well. Puffin flash browser works well but Photon flash browser works well with unjailbroken iphones/android phonesWhat is a sector?  One entire sector is a 600 x 600 area grid. Example #1: Sector 2 is 601 - 1200. Example #2: Sector 3 is 1201 - 1800.How Do I Know What Sector I Am In? My Base Location  If you want to know the exact location of your base you can type /base in the chat line and press enter. This will post your base's coordinates into the sector's comms chat, an excellent feature if you are under attack and would like any available players in your sector to assist you: type \"SOS\" and the Enter key then \"/base\" and the Enter key again. Your aware friends and top sector allies should sail to your defense quickly.Sector Chat  Chat features are sector specific, so players in different sectors can NOT read what is being typed in the comms. However, some enemy sectors may have spies or friends in your home sector so be careful what you type in sector comms, or better yet, say all of your secret planning stuff in your ALLIANCE comms.Can I change Sectors or Move to a New Area In My Sector? (Relocate)  Yes, you are able to change to a new sector or move to a new area within your sector. This is called Relocating. There will be times when relocating is disabled (During Raids & Sector Maintenance). In order to relocate you must have a friend that plays Battle Pirates. If that friend is in the same sector as you, but in a different part, you can relocate to him. Where you are relocated to is random, but you are supposed to be moved to within 100 distance from your friend. If your friend is in a different sector, you will move to that sector, unless your friend is on the border of his sector it is possible that you could get moved to the neighboring sector. Since an update in Oct 13, you can now pay coins to accelerate you relocation. The only exception to this is you cannot pay to relocate within the first 24 hours of a jump. After 24 hours the cost is approx 250 coins (needs verifiying) and slowly decreases with each hour you don't relocate. Directions on How to Relocate: First make sure that you are in Base View by clicking on the Base Button at the top of your screen. Once your inside of your base click on your Outpost and you will see a button labled relocate. When you press this button a new window opens up in the game, with a list of your friends & their ingame names. It does not tell you what sector they are in. Click on a friends portrait, & click on the Relocate button at the bottom of the window. You'll have to confirm, & your screen will then begin to \"shake\". Once you have relocated if you moved to a new sector you will lose all of your bookmarks. Also any fleets that were not at your base are transported to your base with no resources that may have been gathered.Can Our Fleets Cross Into Other Sectors?  To travel to another sector simply locate a Relay Tower and move your fleet to it. You can then chose to relay/jump up to 5 sectors away. There are 5 Relay Towers in every sector: North, East, South, West and Center. Your fleet will move at Warp Speed including appropriate sound effects. Last quarter of the year 2012, Battle pirates upgrade each of the game server from server 1 through 5. Thus,you can travel and cross your fleet accross game server 1 (sector 1-100), game server 2 (sector 101-200),... and so on... game server 5 (sector 401-500). By these new changes, you can gain more target bases, and more fun experience in the actual game.How Are Sectors Arranged?  Sectors are made up of a series of \"Circular Targets\". Draconian Bases make up the center of the \"target\" (bullseye). The Draconian Bases are surrounded by Resource Mines which form the inner ring of the \"target\". Player Bases form the outer ring of the \"target\" surrounding both the center & inner ring. Because of this setup there will be occasions where you come across sectors of the map that are completely blank.How Many Sectors Are There?  Currently there is no definite answer, as this can change over time, but as of January of 2015 there are 500 sectors.My Base How big is my Base?  The calculation for this is not accurate as the inner tiles are diamond shaped, but the base boundaries resemble a rectangle. The top & bottom are 12 diamonds wide, & the sides are 11 diamonds tall. You get more land to build on after each upgrade of your outpost.Is My Base There Forever?  No, the servers deletes inactive bases every 30 days. To be considered inactive you must not log into your Battle Pirate account for at least 30 days straight, but at times this may be increased to 60 days. (Also see above about relocating your base)Why Are There So Many Bases Named Blackheart?  \"Blackheart\" used to be the default name for bases when players have not given their base any name. Players are free to rename your base name once. You just have to click outpost, then click profile and edit the text for your bases name & press enter. Currently new players start with their first name followed by their last names first letter. Ex: Players real name is John Doe his base name would be John_D. A better question might be -- Why are so many bases named Capt. Morgan, Jack Sparrow, or Blackbeard? \u00a0Go figure... best answer is the lack of original thought by those players.Can More Than One Player in a Sector Have the Same Name?  Yes, unless otherwise specified or an error occurs.Bookmarks What are bookmarks for?  Bookmarks are Locations on the map that you can save so that you can quicky focus back. Normally people save locations of: It is a good habit to use bookmarks to send several fleets to the same location.How many bookmarks can I have?  40 is the max.How to remove a bookmark?  There are several ways to do it:How to list my favourite bookmarks in the first 8 bookmark?  Remove and reselect them and they are the first bookmark on the list.Storm Warning Event Overview Quotes Video Fleet infos   HUB Event REVENGE RAID SERIES Revenge Raid \u2022 Revenge Raid II \u2022 Revenge Raid III \u2022 Revenge Raid IV BASE INVADERS SERIES Base Invaders \u2022 Base Invaders II \u2022 Base Invaders III \u2022 Base Invaders IV \u2022 Base Invaders V \u2022 Base Invaders VI STORM SERIES Storm Warning \u2022 Storm Strike \u2022 Storm Force LIGHTNING SERIES Lightning Run \u2022 Lightning Raid \u2022 Lightning Fall DRAC HUNT SERIES Drac Hunt \u2022 Drac Hunt 2 \u2022 Drac Hunt 3 \u2022 Drac Hunt 4 DRAGON's SERIES Dragon's Nest \u2022 Dragon's Nest 2 \u2022 Dragon's Grip \u2022 Dragon's Grip 2 FORSAKEN FURY SERIES Forsaken Fury \u2022 Forsaken Fury 2 BURNING SEA SERIES - (Reaver Introduction) Burning Seas \u2022 Trial by Fire \u2022 Infernal Onslaught \u2022 Reign of Fire WARZONE SERIES - (Reaver vs. Dracs) Riptide \u2022 Deathstroke \u2022 Tempest \u2022 The Reckoning ARCTIC SERIES Snowblind \u2022 Frostbite \u2022 Whiteout \u2022 Hailstorm \u2022 AvalanceCartoon-pirate.png Rockets  \u200bOverview  Rockets are mainly used during base and other land attacks. For example, the Pinch rocket is used to stun long-range turrets or base defending ships \u00a0to reduce damage while dealing with short-range turrets. They can also be used during FvF (Fleet versus fleet) but due to long flight time many ships drive out of the blast area. Rockets can be researched in the Weapons Lab and built in the Launch Pad . However, players may only build or use one rocket at a time. The Pinch is currently the most popular and useful rocket. \u00a0Lower level players often find rockets to have limited usefulness due to flight time, single use nature & low damage. \u00a0One player recommended building a Launch Pad when the fleet captain has a Level 4 or 5 Outpost. \u00a0However, preliminary research for the pinch is important. They are quite different from ship mounted rockets such as Hydra, Maelstrom or Firestorm Rockets.Daisy Cutter  Low yield, surface to surface rocket with large blast radius. Best used against stationary targets due to its long launch time. Only useful to low level players.Widow Maker  Medium yield, surface to surface rocket with a large blast radius. \u200bBunker Buster  Extremely powerful anti-armor rocket designed to destroy a single target. Effective against stationary targets. \u200b \u200bOrion  High yield, surface to surface rocket with a large blast radius. \u200bPinch  Highly charged electromagnetic rocket that overwhelms nearby electronics and renders them useless for several seconds.

It is the sequel to Battlefield 2 and was released on October 25, 2011 for the PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. A sequel, Battlefield 4, was developed and released by EA and DICE on October 29, 2013. Xbox announced Battlefield 3 and Battlefield: Bad Company 2 can be play on Xbox One via Backward compatibility feature on January 10, 2017.Overview  Battlefield 3 includes both singleplayer and co-operative campaigns and features multiplayer gameplay similar to the classic Battlefield 2. Jets made their return as pilotable vehicles, along with prone as an available stance. The PC version is able to support 64 players simultaneously in multiplayer; consoles, however, can only support up to 24 players, resulting in smaller maps. This installment uses a completely new engine, named Frostbite 2, the successor to the Frostbite Engine used in the Bad Company series. The engine introduced Destruction 3.0, allowing for a much larger range of destructible objects, other then buildings, for more realistic destruction. Audio was another focus for the game. There are audio cues that, for example, will let players know if a tank is moving towards or away from them, or if it is having trouble climbing a slope.Singleplayer Overview  The gameplay in the singleplayer campaign differs greatly from the multiplayer component, with numerous quick-time events (QTEs) that are spread throughout the levels. DICE stated that levels are a mix of sandbox and linear though many reviewers later commented that they were moreover linear. The campaign takes place in numerous locations across the world, but is mainly set in Iraq and Iran, the latter country of which plays an important part in the storyline. The gameplay in the campaign varies wildly, including tank combat, acting as a member of a sniper team, and acting as the rear pilot of a F/A-18 Super Hornet jet fighter.Plot  An unidentified US Marine with handcuffs is seen evading law enforcement in New York City. The Marine hops over an overpass onto a subway train, manages to break into it, and engages the train's hijackers, who have also planted explosive charges throughout it. He works his way to the front car, where he is ambushed by Solomon, the man behind the attack.   Eight months prior, Sgt. Henry Blackburn's five-man squad, Misfit 1-3, attempts to find and safely return a U.S. squad investigating a possible IED in Sulaymaniyah, Iraqi Kurdistan, whose last-known position was a market controlled by the People's Liberation and Resistance, an Iranian paramilitary insurgent group who have crossed borders into Iraq. They find the missing squad and discover they had been ambushed by the PLR; but while fending off enemies closing in on their position, a massive earthquake wrecks the city. Several hours later, Blackburn wakes up after being unconscious, listening to a frequency which announces that a major earthquake has affected operational capability in the Iran-Iraq region. Blackburn and other survivors fight their way out of the ruins of the city toward an extraction point. On the same day, the PLR stage a coup in Iran, and the U.S. subsequently invades with fifty-thousand Marines. Lt. Hawkins takes part in an air raid against enemy fighters over Iran and an air strike over Mehrabad Airport. In the aftermath of the air strikes, Blackburn and Misfit 1-3 are sent into Tehran to perform a battle damage assessment and apprehend the leader of the PLR, Faruk Al-Bashir. While investigating an underground bank vault, Al-Bashir's suspected location, Blackburn and his team learn that the PLR have acquired portable Russian nuclear devices, and that two of the three devices are missing.  Being overrun, Misfit 1-3 requests backup from an M1 Abrams column led by Sgt. Miller. The column heads towards Tehran from the southeast through the Kavir Desert, while engaging PLR tanks, as well as assaulting a PLR encampment housing rocket batteries. A few hours later, Miller's tank column arrives in Tehran and begins to facilitate Blackburn's helicopter extraction, but is subsequently captured while waiting for the arrival of the Quick Reaction Force. Shortly later, he is promptly executed on film by Solomon and Al-Bashir after the latter gave a brief monologue. Two days later, Misfit 1-3 resumes the search for Al-Bashir. They engage PLR soldiers patrolling the streets of Tehran, and come upon an apartment block which they suspect Al-Bashir is hiding in. While assaulting the building, Al-Bashir tries to escape via SUV, but ends up crashing after Blackburn fires on the vehicle. Blackburn and Campo manage to capture a fatally-wounded Al-Bashir, who realizes Solomon betrayed him and reveals his plot to detonate the nukes in Paris and New York City, before succumbing to his wounds. Due to the info on Al-Bashir's mobile phone, Misfit 1-3 gets a lead on an arms dealer named Amir Kaffarov. They discover he was working with Solomon and Al-Bashir. A week later, they head towards northern Iran to capture Kaffarov, who is located in his villa on the coast of the Caspian Sea, near the Azerbaijan border. On the drive towards the villa, Misfit 1-3 is ambushed. They discover that they have just engaged Russian VDV troops. They move up a hill and encounter a massive presence of Russian airborne elements being airdropped into the fields ahead. They have no choice but to push on and engage the Russians. After clearing a battalion-size of enemy troops and destroying multiple BMP-2s, a Su-25 ground-attack jet begins to engage them. In the ensuing chaos, two of Blackburn's squad mates, Christian Matkovic and Steve\u00a0Campo, are killed, which puts Blackburn and Montes at odds with their commanding officer, Cole. Meanwhile, a GRU team led by Dimitri Mayakovsky assaults Kaffarov's villa. Kaffarov tries to bribe his way out, but Dima begins to interrogate him nonetheless. Later, Blackburn arrives at the villa and finds Dima and an unconscious Kaffarov. Dima reveals Solomon's plan to Blackburn and requests his cooperation to prevent a war between their nations. Meanwhile, Blackburn's commanding officer Cole arrives at gunpoint. This forces Blackburn to shoot and kill his superior before he could kill Dima. Due to his actions, Blackburn and Montes are brought to New York City and interrogated by CIA agents Gordon and Whistler, to whom he explains all of his previous operations. During Blackburn's captivity, Dima's squad attempts to stop the attack in Paris. They engage PLR operatives through an office building and the EURONEXT stock exchange. French police and GIGN units arrive at the entrance of the stock exchange and engage both Dima's squad and the PLR operatives, all while Dima is chasing the nuke carrier. His squadmate, Vladimir, is killed during the chase. This, however, does not stop Dima. He continues the chase and finally catches up to the carrier. After securing the bag, Kiril opens it and discovers it was a decoy. The nuke then detonates in the distance at the EURONEXT building, killing eighty-thousand people. In the aftermath, Dima and Kril suffer from the effects of radiation poisoning due to the nuclear device's detonation. The CIA agents do not believe Blackburn's story, since Solomon is a CIA informant and there is no concrete proof of his involvement in the terrorist attacks. They instead believe that Russia is responsible for the attacks, and that Dima has tricked Blackburn. With no other options, Blackburn and Montes break out of captivity to stop the attack in New York City. The events of the introductory mission play over again, revealing Blackburn as the man in handcuffs and the train's hijackers as operatives of the PLR. When ambushed by Solomon, Blackburn gains the upper hand by grabbing hold of a PLR operative with a detonator, allowing him to detonate the explosives, causing the train to crash. Blackburn then pursues Solomon through the sewers and engages the PLR along the way, before climbing up to street level. Montes, having obtained a police car, picks up Blackburn and engages Solomon and the PLR in a brief vehicular chase, which ends with both cars crashing in Times Square. As a bewildered crowd watches on, Montes is shot and killed by Solomon, but Blackburn catches him off-guard while reloading, which results in a brawl between the two. Blackburn manages to knock Solomon to the ground and begins to beat him to death with a brick. He then recovers the final nuke. The epilogue depicts Dima, suffering from the effects of radiation poisoning, writing about the efforts of both him and Blackburn to stop Solomon's plan \"to set fire to the world\". As he finishes, there is a knock outside his door, prompting Dima to ready his handgun.Co-op Campaign  The mode supports two players online (no split screen play), spans six missions, and is a standalone section, separate from the single player game. The missions revolve around minor operations by marines of Snake 6-6 as they encounter the PLR. Missions include ground, air vehicle, as well as tight urban arid warfare, causing players to work together to complete objectives. It is through this that players will eventually unlock weapons for multiplayer. Co-op gameplay debuted at EA's Gamescom 2011 Conference. It featured DICE general manager Karl Magnus-Troedsson and EA Games executive vice president Patrick Soderlund demoing the mission Exfiltration. The gameplay showcased the new thermal weapons, smarter A.I., teammate reviving, and spot mechanic from Bad Company 2. David Spinnier, lead co-op designer stated that the levels have randomized elements that change each time a co-op level is played, making it a different experience every time. He also said that the missions will be shorter, to aid replayability.Multiplayer Ranks and Awards  There are a total of 145 ranks. After rank 45 (Colonel), Colonel service stars are introduced, requiring 230,000 points for each subsequent Colonel rank. In comparison to Battlefield: Bad Company 2, Battlefield 3 has 10 times the unlocks over weapons, weapon attachments, gadgets and an unlock tree for vehicles alone. In addition, unlocks are more spread through the ranks, instead of ending after rank 22.  There are also Ribbons and Medals (similar to BC2's Pins and Insignias) with examples being Rush Ribbon, Shotgun Medal, etc. Service Stars are added to the player's weapon skill badge, kit, vehicles, and their overall rank, and allow for further promotion.Classes  Classes in Battlefield 3 have been tweaked in relation to their roles from Battlefield: Bad Company 2, whilst still utilizing the same four class system.Maps and Gametypes  There are a total of nine multiplayer maps featured in the base game with expansion increasing the total to twenty-nine maps. The locations of the multiplayer maps, like the campaign, includes Europe and the Middle East. More specifically, the game takes place in the cities of Paris and Tehran. All gametypes from Battlefield: Bad Company 2 return, with Team Deathmatch being a new addition. There are a total of five gametypes in the base game, with expansions increasing the total to thirteen. Gametypes in expansions can only be played in that expansion's respective maps. Attack Helicopters and fighter jets are available in Rush as well as in Conquest and Conquest Assault. Hardcore and infantry-only options are also present (Note that the The infantry-only option only removes all classes of vehicles except transports, such as the HMMWV, RIB, etc.)Weapons and Gadgets  Weapon unlocks obtained from the co-op campaign are carried over to multiplayer. There are currently over 50 weapons to unlock, and also each primary weapon contains three attachment slots ranging from foregrips to optics. Weapon accessories are unlocked per weapon unlike in Bad Company 2. Unlocking an attachment such as a Red Dot Sight while using one class still enables it for every other class that can use that weapon. However, the attachment will not be available on other weapons until it is unlocked. DICE has stated that it takes over \"100 hours\" to unlock everything for a kit in Multiplayer.Vehicles  Battlefield 3 features over twenty different vehicles that are at the player's disposal with vehicles split into tweleve different classes.Factions  There are two multiplayer factions: the Russian Army and the United States Marine Corps. Like with previous Battlefield games, their default kits are equipped with faction-specific weaponry until others are unlocked.Notable Features Downloadable Content  Battlefield 3 features many downloadable content in the form of promotional offers, short cuts, expansions, etc.Exclusive Pre-orders  Players who pre-ordered the Battlefield 3 Limited Edition from worldwide select retailers got exclusive access to eight multiplayer dog-tags and SPECACT skins. They were released on the PlayStation store on January 16, 2012 in a bundle for $2.99 or 240 Microsoft points and were released a week later to the Xbox LIVE Marketplace.Promotional Offers  Many Battlefield 3 Promotional Offers were given out following the game's release that gave players specialized dog-tags for use.

Despite this, there are noticeable differences in the story, as well as mainly depicting the events via Dimitri \"Dima\" Mayakovsky's perspective, in contrast to Henry Blackburn's point of view mainly used in the game, hence the title.Development  Battlefield 3 was revealed on February 4, 2011 with a teaser trailer called My Life, and was the cover story of the March 2011 issue of GameInformer. The game was first showcased on March 1, 2011 during GDC 2011, which revealed unedited gameplay for the first time. DICE announced shortly after that the development of the PC versions of Battlefield 1943 and Onslaught gamemode inBattlefield: Bad Company 2 were cancelled to concentrate on the development of Battlefield 3, stating it would be their biggest Battlefield release yet. The developers had recorded real life sounds of vehicles and weapons from a military training exercise with their goal being to create \"cleaner and brighter audio.\" As stated by Thomas Danko, voice over producer at DICE: \"No FPS ever had this large amount of VO variations for Multi Play, not even close. Over 300 for the \"Man down\" event alone.\"Beta  An Open Beta for Battlefield 3, announced at E3 2011, ran across the PS3, Xbox 360 and PC starting September 29, 2011 and ending October 10, 2011. The maps featured were Operation M\u00e9tro and gamemode Rush (the same as in the Alpha trial), and Caspian Border in 64-player Conquest gamemode (PC only). DICE, during the announcement of the Beta, stated that there would be no level or unlock cap in the Beta, allowing players to unlock any weapon in the game. Owners of Medal of Honor: Limited Edition and Medal of Honor: Tier 1 Edition, as well customers who pre-ordered Battlefield 3 on EA's Origin service, got 48-hour early access to the beta. This early access was originally intended to be a closed beta for owners of the special editions of Medal of Honor, although for an unknown reason this was changed to the early access.Marketing  In a similar fashion to Battlefield: Bad Company and Battlefield: Bad Company 2, Battlefield 3 was heavily marketed since it's official announcement, thanks to a marketing budget of nearly US$200 million from owner Electronic Arts. The first set of trailers after the Teaser Trailer was the introduction of the Fault Line series, starting with the Battlefield 3: Gameplay Trailer and ending with the full twelve minute Battlefield 3: Fault Line trailer, as well as a developer commentary by Patrick Bach and being the setting of the Battlefield 3: My Life Trailer, which has commonly been shown as a TV advert during popular TV events such as the FA Cup final in the United Kingdom. During E3 2011, the Thunder Run trailer was unveiled, alongside two gameplay trailers set on the multiplayer map Operation M\u00e9tro. Following the huge success of the three trailers after E3, a new trailer, the Caspian Border gameplay trailer, was released after being shown at Gamescom 2011, showcasing jet and vehicle gameplay. In late September 2011, during the build-up to the Open Beta, a new trailer, set to the rap song \"99 Problems\" by artist Jay-Z, was revealed to be a new TV ad. The final three trailers for the game were released in the week before its release - a multiplayer trailer, a story trailer, and a live-action/gameplay trailer - each being well received by the gaming community. In the live-action/gameplay trailer, a new tagline was introduced - \"Is it real? Or is it Battlefield 3?\"Special Editions Limited Edition Digital Limited Edition Gamestop Limited Edition Premium Edition Reception  Battlefield 3 has received mostly positive reviews from critics at launch.Criticism  The marketing from certain senior EA executives and staff hasn't been met without some criticism. A number of high-level EA staff began attacking main rivals Activision and, in particular, the Call of Duty series, saying, on several occasions, that Battlefield 3 would soundly defeat the Call of Duty franchise, or words to that effect. However, Activision employees, including publishing boss Eric Hirshberg, responded negatively to these statements, saying EA's attitude was bad for the industry as a whole.PS3 Owners vs EA Lawsuit  At Sony's E3 2011 press conference, EA announced that for all PlayStation 3 players, each new copy of Battlefield 3 would come with a free code of Battlefield 1943. This resulted in many to buy/pre-order the game, greatly boosting the game's overall sales. It was later revealed that EA and DICE had decided to retract their offer, stating that many of those who had pre-ordered Battlefield 3 already owned Battlefield 1943 and had been playing it for years. To compensate for this, EA and Sony announced that all PSN users would get a week early access to Back to Karkand. In spite of this, several PlayStation 3 owners filed a class action lawsuit against EA. Edelson McGuire, head of the group, alleged that EA \u201dmisled and profited from thousands of their customers by making a promise that they could not keep\". EA has since apologized for this and later issued codes for PS3 users to download Battlefield 1943 (now expired) in response to the lawsuit, and also kept the one-week early access deal for not only Back to Karkand but all future expansions for the game as well.Trivia Battlefield Wiki Battlefield: Bad Company 2  Battlefield: Bad Company 2 (also known as Bad Company 2, BFBC2 or BC2) is the\u00a0tenth installment in the Battlefield Series and was developed by DICE and published by Electronic Arts. It is the sequel to Battlefield: Bad Company and was praised by critics, many of which commended DICE's work on the destructible environments, and its robust multiplayer component. Xbox announced Battlefield: Bad Company 2 and Battlefield 3 can be play on Xbox One via Backward compatibility feature on January 10, 2017.Singleplayer Overview  Gameplay in Battlefield: Bad Company 2 resembles that of Battlefield: Bad Company. The story takes place mostly in South America, allowing players to play through missions using any tactics they choose in which the game allows. Like its predecessor, Bad Company, Bad Company 2 features destructible environments. However, more destruction is now possible with Destruction 2.0; allowing players to completely demolish and collapse buildings, rather than just its walls. Micro destruction is also included allowing small parts of cover to be chipped away rather than entire sections.Plot  In October 1944, a group of US commandos infiltrate an island in the Sea of Japan to extract a Japanese scientist with war decisive information. They successfully secure the defecting Japanese scientist who was working on a secret weapon codenamed \"The Black Weapon\" (a scalar weapon), and attempt to escape the island on a stolen submarine. But after repeated warnings by the scientist, the commandos witness the effects of Black Weapon's power and subsequently perish, sparking a myth about what really happened in Operation Aurora. In the present day, Bad Company is on a counter-intelligence operation behind enemy lines in Russia in attempt to secure a high value individual of the US military, and a device related to a scalar weapon. Despite escaping Russian soldiers, and completing what they thought was their final mission in B-company, the device is discovered to be a fake. Being impressed with their previous activities, Army General Braidwood assigns them to the Special Activities Division, and tasks them with delivering information to Agent Aguire, much to the disappointment of Sgt. Redford. The squad travels to Bolivia in search of Aguire. Through many firefights with paramilitaries, they manage to save Aguire just before a Russian hauls him onto a waiting Mi-24 Hind. After discovering that Aguire's findings were stolen by the Russians, Aguire requests the squad to get all his intelligence detailing the scalar weapon from a satellite. The squad moves up to take the mountain with assistance from their pilot Flynn and his UH-60 Black Hawk. After taking over the satellite station, Sweetwater codes the satellite to crash, with the squad driving over cross country to find it, taking on Vodniks and Quad Bikes along the way. After reaching the satellite, the squad successfully defeat a Russian counterattack aimed at destroying the satellite, but soon bad weather rolls in. While Redford and Haggard go to find transport, with Sweetwater following, Marlowe soon finds the data storage unit and proceeds to go down the mountain during a blizzard, taking on Russian patrols, and is soon extracted by the others in Flynn's helicopter. During extraction, Aguire briefs the squad about the man responsible for building a scalar weapon named Arkady Kirilenko; the Russian Army colonel the squad failed to eliminate in Chukotka, who is believed to be hiding in Chile. Marlowe and the squad travel to Chile, where they, aided by US Armoured forces and Marines, find Kirilenko, though he soon escapes after US Command starts shelling Kirilenko's position. Left only with papers from Kirilenko's office, Sweetwater discovers there is a shipping manifest for a lost ship called the \"Sangre del Toro.\" Aided by the rest of the squad getting the coordinates, Marlowe finds the ship and retrieves an unnamed compound essential to the use of the weapon, and finds out the truth behind Operation Aurora. While attempting to meet Aguire in Colombia, the squad's helicopter is shot down by a Javelin and they become separated. Sweetwater and Marlowe regroup first, taking on a militia counter-attack, and they soon find the rest of the squad. After fighting through heavily defended Russian bases, the squad find Flynn, and then race to a helicopter base on Quad Bikes. After fighting through Russian territories in a salvaged Black Hawk, the squad reach the rendezvous with Aguire, and Marlowe gives Aguire the compound, while Redford demands to know what's happening. However, Aguire double-crossed the squad by allying with Kirilenko, his rival in the quest for the scalar weapon. Aguire wanted revenge against the United States for what happened to his father, one of the commandos in original raid on Japan, after Marlowe revealed that the US military callously sent them to their deaths. Despite the alliance, Kirilenko betrays Aguire and kills him. Flynn intervenes and saves the squad at the cost of his own life, his helicopter shot down by an RPG. While still mourning after Flynn's loss, the squad overhear a Russian soldier's radio, which the squad use to find their position. They begin to move towards a city, but then Kirlienko begins the detonation of the scalar weapon. The squad begin advancing through a Venezuelan city, being attacked by Russian and militia troops, along with mortars. However, as they reach the mouth of a large river, they witness a huge firefight between US and Russian troops. However, as the fight reaches a climax, the scalar weapon detonates, annihilating the US forces and sending \"all tech dead.\" The squad then fight through the blast zone in pursuit of Kirilenko, but, as the squad reach the plane, an An-225 Mryia, they realize it's taking off. The squad unanimously vote that they should hijack the plane, and set off through sewer tunnels towards it. Though they had to discard their weapons, they climb on board through the undercarriage, and await dawn. The squad begins to progress through the plane, taking out multiple guards before reaching the scalar weapon, which is protected by a reinforced pane of glass, which Haggard says will \"take an act of God to get through, or a lot of C4.\" The squad then fight towards the cockpit of the plane, but realize that Kirilenko is in the Scalar chamber itself when they discover that the cockpit is empty. After detonating C4 to get through the glass, the squad destroy the Scalar weapon, and then proceed to bail out of the plane. However, as Sweetwater tries to give Marlowe the last parachute, Kirilenko tackles him, and Marlowe is forced to dive out of the plane, killing Kirilenko in a free fall with an MP-443. Sweetwater passes Marlowe a parachute in midair, and the pair land safely in Texas alongside the rest of the squad. However, as they begin to celebrate, General Braidwood tells them to follow him in a HMMVW, as the Russians are invading through Alaska. The last cutscene shows a map of Russian forces swarming through Alaska and Canada, quickly advancing on the US border.Multiplayer  Multiplayer allows players to select their inventory from four kits during a match. Actions performed in matches, such as resupplying teammates, reviving fallen teammates and killing players, gives players generic experience, allowing them to increase their rank over time, and kit related experience points, which contributes to unlocking weapons and upgrades for each kit individually. Specific actions will also award players with Pins and Insignias which also grant additional experience. The dog tag system was included in game as with previous Battlefield installments. By killing a player with a knife attack, players can collect others' dog tags and can then view them in the main menu.Gametypes  Bad Company 2 features four gametypes.

It was developed as an indirect sequel to Battlefield Vietnam, bringing players into the jungles of Vietnam during the war and offering era exclusive vehicles and weapons.Development  The game was first announced in February 2009. On October 19, DICE posted a Twitter announcement stating the game will have dedicated server support. This was in response to Infinity Ward's announcement on October 17 that Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 would not support dedicated servers. During an interview with GameZone's Dakota Grabowski in March 2010, Senior Producer Patrick Bach revealed that following the negative feedback from PC gamers after the first Battlefield: Bad Company was not released on the PC, Electronic Arts and DICE had a separate dedicated team working on the PC version of Bad Company 2. Bach stated \"We see it as very, very hardcore and important part of our customers. So we put a lot of effort into making sure that everything worked perfect.\" Bach also commented on the use of peripherals such as a mouse and keyboard on consoles, saying \"I don't think that we have any special connections to peripherals to the consoles [...] The biggest problem with peripherals for consoles is that the console itself is a level playground. It's even and you know the consumer has the same technology and have the same peripherals and same controls \u2013 which makes it easier for us to create a game that feels fair. By catering to a mouse and keyboard for the consoles, it would maybe skew the even playground.\"Beta and Demo  The first Beta was on the PlayStation 3, which ran from November 11, 2009 to December 28, 2009. The Beta featured the full multiplayer system and one map, Arica Harbor on Rush. Many evident modifications have been made and glitches had been fixed since.

The PC Beta ran from January 28, 2010, to February 25, 2010. The demo was scheduled to be released for consoles at the first of February 2010. The multiplayer demo was confirmed for the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 on January 31. In order to have played the PC Beta, you must have had pre-ordered the game from certain retailers, or you could have registered for a Beta key at the Battlefield Bad Company 2 site, which would give you a code to access the multiplayer. The Battlefield Bad Company 2 demo featured the map Port Valdez, a snowy map set in Alaska. The game mode included was the new Rush mode, which is essentially Gold Rush from Battlefield: Bad Company, simply renamed. Each class started with one main weapon, a pistol, and the class's respective gadget. As the player gained more points with a certain class, a second weapon for that class becomes available. Also available for unlock was the Tracer Gun, the G3 combat rifle, the Mk 14 EBR, M1A1 Thompson, M1 Garand (only for Battlefield veterans), several shotguns, and the \"Vehicle specialty.\"Marketing Special Editions Limited Edition Ultimate Edition Digital Deluxe Edition Reception  Battlefield: Bad Company 2 received generally high reviews from critics.

It was first put into service in 1963, becoming the standard U.S. assault rifle by 1969, replacing the M14 rifle. The standard M16 fires the 5.56x45mm NATO round, but can be modified to fire different cartridges with the addition of a new barrel, bolt, and sometimes firing pin. With its long barrel, the rifle can be very accurate at anywhere up to 550 yards for a standard issue rifle, and even longer for specialized variants with heavier barrels such as the MK12. The M16 has a rate of fire of around 700-950 rounds per minute, depending on the model. The M16A2 and A4 variants fire in three-round burst or semi-automatic, while the original M16 and the A1 and A3 variants fire fully-automatic or semi-automatic. It has been largely replaced by the lighter M4 Carbine in the U.S. military but still sees use in training and is still widely used by other miltaries throughout the world. All main variants of the M16 rifles have been featured throughout the Battlefield series.Battlefield Vietnam M16  In Battlefield Vietnam, the M16 is one of the standard issue assault rifles for the US Army, USMC and ARVN factions. It is issued to the Assault kit. It is functionally similar to the CAR-15. It has medium damage, medium recoil, average spread and a high rate of fire. It can kill in up to four-five shots. In close-quarters, it can be very effective due to its high power. It is limited by a small 20 round magazine and a relatively long reload.M16 Sniper  The M16 Sniper (called the M16 with Scope in the killfeed and console) is also available for all American and South Vietnamese divisions. It is issued to the Scout kit. It is essentially an M16 with a x6 zoom scope, meant for medium range engagements. It holds the same characteristics of the regular M16, only being limited to semi-automatic fire. It should be noted that it still has the same accuracy, meaning that outside of medium range its spread can throw off one's aim. The user of this rifle will also only have two spare magazines instead of the normal six of its non-scoped counterpart.Battlefield 2 M16A2  The M16A2 is the standard assault rifle used by the United States Marine Corps in Battlefield 2. Two variants are used, one with an underslung M203 in use by the Assault, and one with no M203 used by the Medic. Its damage is low compared to its counterparts, the AK47 and AK101: It requires a minimum of four rounds to kill, and may take upwards of six rounds depending on round placement. However, it has a higher rate of fire and significantly lower spread values. It is the only default assault rifle which fires in three-round-burst, which limits its effective damage output despite its higher rate of fire.Battlefield 2: Special Forces  In Battlefield 2: Special Forces, the M16A2 is issued to the United States Navy SEALs Medic kit. It is identical in form and stats as its vanilla counterpart.Battlefield: Bad Company  The M16 is an assault rifle featured in Battlefield: Bad Company.Singleplayer  In singleplayer, the M16 can be taken from fallen Legionnaire Mercenaries in the final assault on Serdar's palace, in the mission Par for the Course, and as a collectible on Crash and Grab.Multiplayer  In multiplayer, the M16 is an unlockable issued to the Assault kit. The M16 is fully automatic and has a 50-round magazine with 150 rounds in reserve, like all assault rifles in the game. It has a low rate of fire compared to other assault rifles, but this is balanced by high damage and accuracy. Even with its low rate of fire, its high damage can best most automatic weapons in close quarters. It also has the default M203, which has a faster reload than the GP-30 or XM320 grenade launchers. There is an \"M16 Trophy\" awarded once a player achieves six kills with the M16 in a round. This trophy is usually accompanied by the 'Assault Rifle Efficiency' trophy when awarded.Battlefield Heroes M16  In Battlefield Heroes, the M16 was released as part of the Battlefield Heroes Gets Bad Company event. Its stats in the Battlefield Heroes weapon store say that it has a high rate of fire, short range and a 45-round magazine. It is the equivalent of the National Army AK-74, and costs 1120BF to buy (1200 for National players).Tier 1 M16  A second M16 was released as part of the Tier 1 event, named as the Tier 1 M16. This new M16 has an unusable scope, a 30-round magazine, a low rate of fire and a long effective range. The Tier 1 M16 costs 1200BF to buy for an unlimited duration, and is only available to the Royal Army.Scoped SOF M16  As a part of the Battlefield Heroes Christmas event, the SOF M16was released on December 2, 2010 for purchase through the in-game store. It features a winter camouflaged M16 with a usable scope.Battlefield: Bad Company 2  Only available in Battlefield: Bad Company 2's multiplayer, the M16A2 is the 7th and last assault rifle issued to the Assault kit requiring 47000 points to unlock. It has 30 round magazine size, a three-round burst fire mode, an M203 and can also accept a Red Dot Sight or a 4X Rifle Scope, like all kit specific weapons in Bad Company 2. Although being limited to burst fire, its fire rate is quite high. Due to its stopping power and accuracy it can be very effective against other assault rifles and even SMGs at medium to close range. The ability to 'pulse' the weapon's trigger gives the M16A2 an edge by increasing the weapon's fire rate.M16A2 SA  The M16A2 SA is also available to those who have purchased the SPECACT DLC. It is the M16A2 customized with Woodland, Desert or Arctic camouflage depending on the environment the player is in. The M16A2 SA is obtainable on XBL (Xbox Live) for 160MS points, through Dr. Pepper as a promotion, or purchase through the PlayStation Store (PS3) or the EA Store (PC). A player using this weapon can, optionally, also be equipped with a special uniform.Battlefield: Bad Company 2: Vietnam  The M16A1 (also known as M16) is a weapon featured in the Battlefield: Bad Company 2: Vietnam expansion, issued to the Assault kit. It has an automatic fire mode. Compared to other assault rifles, it has the highest rate of fire, the lowest damage, the longest reload time, and the smallest hipfire spread. As a result of the high rate of fire and lowest hipfire spread, The M16A1 handles well while hipfiring in an unexpected scenario when facing hostiles.Battlefield Play4Free  In Battlefield Play4Free, the M16A2 is a purchasable weapon for the Assault Kit. It fires in a three-round burst mode and has very high accuracy, allowing it to kill in two or three bursts at most ranges. However, the three-round burst configuration reduces the overall rate of fire, and can thus come off worse in a fight with fully automatic weapons.Battlefield 3  The M16 family once again appears in Battlefield 3, this time as two separate weapons; the M16A3 which is fully automatic and the M16A4 which fires in three-round bursts.M16A3 Singleplayer  The M16A3 appears in most levels where the USMC is present. It is either found without attachments, or with an optic and underslung M320.Co-op  The M16A3 is the primary weapon for the hosting player in Operation Exodus(the other player has an M249 SAW) with an M320 and ACOG Scope.Multiplayer  The M16A3 is the standard assault rifle of the United States Marine Corps' Assault kit in Battlefield 3, filling in the same role as the AK-74M which is the Russian Ground Forces' starting assault rifle. It can later be unlocked for the Russian Ground Forces with 220,000 Assault points.  The M16A3 does the same damage as most Assault weapons. It possesses low kick, low spread, and a relatively high rate of fire. It is capable of rail-mounting either the M320 or the M26 MASS. The M16A3 tends to kick rightwards hard, so the Foregrip attachment is recommended to remedy this. When fitted with a non-magnifying optical sight such as a Reflex or Holographic Sight, the front iron sight is still visible on the weapon.M16A4 Multiplayer  The M16A4 is the first burst-fire weapon unlocked. It is available for both factions at 89,000 Assault points. Though aesthetically identical, the M16A4 differs from the M16A3 in a few notable ways, the foremost feature being its burst, semi-auto fire selector unlike the M16A3 which has a full auto, semi auto fire selector. As of patch 1.04, its stats differ from the M16A3. The M16A4 has only half the spread of the M16A3 when aiming down sights, making it much more viable as a long range weapon. The M16A4 also has tendency to kick rightwards, but not to an extent to M16A3. Still, Foregrip attachment is recommended to remedy this. The M16A4 also possesses the semi-unique feature of sharing unlocks with the M16A3\u2014otherwise only applicable to the M4 and M4A1. Any kills by the M16A3 or M16A4 total together so any unlocks received for the M16A3 will immediately be available to use on the M16A4 and vice versa.Battlefield 4  The M16A4 is featured in Battlefield 4.Singleplayer  The M16A4 is a collectible found in Singapore. It is found in a dark room inside the repair bay, underneath cardboard boxes. These boxes need to be blown up for it to be obtained. It is equipped with a HOLO, Magnifier and Muzzle Brake. It sports an Atomic Snow finish.Multiplayer  It is a unlocked last in the Assault Rifle progression. It has a high RPM, provided that the player has a fast trigger finger, and is capable of going head to head with PDWs and carbines at close range. Much like other assault rifles, it holds 30 rounds per magazine. It has a very fast reload time, one of the shortest in its class. As a burst-fire weapon, the M16A4 receives the most recoil at the end of each burst. This recoil can be reduced with the use of the Angled or Folding foregrips.Battlefield Hardline  The M16A3 is a weapon featured in Battlefield Hardline. It was first seen in the first multiplayer trailer. It is a purchasable assault rifle for the Operator class, and by default is equipped with a Vertical Grip. It is exclusive to the Law Enforcement faction without the Weapon License.Singleplayer  The M16A3 is first seen dropped by a criminal in Case Closed. In later episodes, Criminals use it alongside the AKM.Trivia Battlefield: Vietnam Battlefield: Bad Company Battlefield: Bad Company 2 Battlefield: Bad Company 2: Vietnam Battlefield Play4Free Battlefield 3 Battlefield 4 Battlefield Hardline External links Weapons Weapons Portal  Welcome to Battlefield Wiki's weapons portal.\nFrom this page, you can find links to all of the wiki's content on the subject of weapons in the Battlefield gamesBattlefield 3: Back to Karkand  Battlefield 3: Back to Karkand is the first expansion pack available for Battlefield 3.

Before the release of Battlefield 3, when it was revealed that PlayStation users would not be getting their free copy of Battlefield 1943 with the game, EA and Sony did a new deal where it was announced that the PlayStation 3 would be getting the Back to Karkand DLC one week early. This caused some discontent from gamers on the Xbox 360 and PC platforms. However, due to a class-action lawsuit being filed against EA for not supplying Battlefield 1943 to PS3 owners as promised, they gave it to PS3 owners for free after its\u00a0release. This also led to early access for all future expansions of the game for PlayStation 3 players.Reception  Back to Karkand has received positive reviews from game industry critics.

The HK416 shares lower receiver, magazine, receiver extension, grip, trigger assembly and stock with normal AR-15 rifles, like the M16 and M4 carbine, leading to a level of parts commonality, weapon familiarity and relative low cost. The HK416 uses a short-stroke piston design from the G36 that cycles the bolt carrier, instead of the direct gas impingement system used by the AR-15, which prevents carbon build up inside the bolt carrier to avoid weapon failure and increase reliability and lifespan of the weapon. It is currently in use by many countries around the world including, but not limited to, the United States, Norway, Poland, Singapore, and Turkey.Battlefield: Bad Company  The M416 is a weapon featured in Battlefield: Bad Company.Singleplayer  The M416 is the first weapon the player starts with in every mission (except for Crash and Grab, where the MP-443 Grach takes its place). Marlowe and Redford always have it in cutscenes. The soldiers of Juneau convoy in Welcome to Bad Company are equipped with the M416, possibly implying it is the standard service rifle of the US Army.Multiplayer  The M416 is the default assault rifle issued to the American Assault kit, and is the American counterpart to the Russian AEK-971 and MEC AUG. It has average stats and is capable of killing in 8-10 shots. Like every other assault rifle in the game, it has a 50 round magazine, 150 rounds in reserve and an M203 grenade launcher. Compared to other assault rifles, it has very clear iron sights which are good for pinpoint accuracy.Battlefield: Bad Company 2  The M416 is a weapon featured in Battlefield: Bad Company 2 as the sixth assault rifle issued to the Assault kit, requiring 35000 points to unlock. It has a 30 round magazine with a grenade launcher, and can be further modified with a Red Dot Sight or 4X Rifle Scope. It boasts all-around effectiveness, but is still outclassed by SMGs and shotguns at close quarters and semi-automatic rifles at longer ranges. Compared to its close counterpart, the AUG, the M416 is slightly superior in recoil control, reload time and minimum damage. It is equal in maximum damage per second and slightly inferior to the AUG in hipfire spread. The weapon's good and balanced stats give it an easy learning curve and excellent versatility making it a popular assault rifle. While the iron sights are clear and open, it may be advisable to equip a Red Dot Sight or a 4x Scope on the M416 as the bullet trajectory actually travels higher than the end of the front post sight.Battlefield Play4Free  The 416-Carbine is an Assault Rifle featured in Battlefield Play4Free. The 416-Carbine has the best range of the assault rifles, tied with the AN-94 for long range, but an increased close range distance by ten meters. However, it deals much lower damage and has noticeable recoil. It has 20 rounds per magazine, same as the M4A1, but comes with 1 less magazine than the former upon spawning. Aesthetically, the weapon has the typical black finish of regular weapons, and the sights closely resemble those of the MP5 and \ufeffG3A4. The 416-Carbine has a similar appearance to the M27 IAR in the same game, but the M27 has an unusable bipod attached and longer magazines.Battlefield 3  The M416 is a weapon featured in Battlefield 3.Singleplayer  The M416 appears as the starting weapon of Henry Blackburn during the mission Rock and a Hard Place.Multiplayer  The M416 is the first unlockable weapon of the Assault kit at 22,000 Assault score. It boasts the same damage as most other assault rifles, mild recoil, and fast reload times for both empty and partially-full reloads much like the M16A3. The M416 has less tendency to kick rightwards than the M16A3, allowing for better recoil control during automatic fire. The accuracy is particularly high, also comparable to an M16A3. It also has a lower first shot recoil than the M16A3, but a higher first shot recoil than the AK-74M. It is nearly identical to the M27 IAR,\u00a0which is based off the M416, although the M416 has a smaller magazine, a shorter barrel, and differs in accuracy and recoil. As of the December Soldier Upgrade, premium members will be able to equip the Airman Camo on the M416 by default and can also equip the Woodland Stripe Camo once the M416 Specialist assignment is completed.Battlefield 4  The M416 is a weapon featured in Battlefield 4.Singleplayer  William Dunn wields the M416 in Baku with a ACOG (4x). It can be unlocked for singleplayer missions by completing the Bronze assignment in Tashgar\u00a0by scoring 5,000 points.\u00a0It is fitted with a Reflex, Magnifier, Angled Grip\u00a0and Heavy Barrel. It features an ERDL Woodland paint.Multiplayer  The M416 is the second Assault Rifle unlocked for the Assault kit, after the SCAR-H and the default AK-12 and AN-94. Much like in BF:BC2 and Battlefield 3, it is a very balanced weapon, a middle ground between the other assault rifles, and hence is versatile for many situations. It has a moderate firerate at 750 RPM, average damage, good accuracy and a quick reload. Its recoil is average, similar to the AK-12 but with a slight rightwards pull. Like the other American and Western European weapons, it unlocks the US attachments. The Chinese and Russian attachments are unlocked through Battlepacks.Battlefield Hardline  The M416 is a weapon featured in Battlefield Hardline as a purchasable assault rifle available to the Criminal Operator kit.\u00a0 It has the second highest rate of fire in its weapon class at 850 RPM. By default, the M416 is equipped with the Comp M4S.Trivia General Battlefield: Bad Company series Battlefield Play4Free Battlefield 3 Battlefield 4 Battlefield Hardline External links M14 EBR  The Mark 14 Enhanced Battle Rifle (EBR) is an American selective fire military rifle based upon the M14 rifle. Originally created in 2001 for the United States Navy SEALs, it was first deployed for combat use in 2003. It is now used by the United States Army and Coast Guard. New improvements such an adjustable stock, Picatinny rails on the top and sides of the rifle and new construction techniques allow the M14 to become a highly adaptive rifle, yet it still retains its firepower coming from the powerful 7.62x51mm NATO round.Battlefield: Bad Company 2  The M14 Mod 0 Enhanced is a weapon featured in Battlefield: Bad Company 2 and is unlocked at rank 19. The weapon is semi-automatic in game and uses a 10 round magazine, and it can be modified with either a Red Dot Sight or a 4X Rifle Scope. It is highly accurate and does high damage, but is balanced by its small magazine and high recoil. These traits make the M14 very deadly at medium and long range combat against weapons such as assault rifles and SMGs, though it is at a disadvantage in close quarters combat. With Magnum Ammunition equipped, the M14 will kill in three shots at any distance, and can kill a slightly injured opponent at close range with just two shots. Equipping an optic can be very advantageous with the M14 as it greatly aids in long range accuracy. The M14 is nearly identical to the semi-auto sniper rifles, with one of the few differences being that the M14 can use iron sights. In fact, the M14 has very similar stats to the Type 88 Sniper and SVU Snaiperskaya, only differing in reload time and that the M14 is affected by spray when moving and aiming at the same time. This, coupled with a 4X rifle scope, allows the M14 to help players act as designated marksman to take down long range targets. It is also very similar to the M1 Garand in stats, only differing in reload time, ammunition capacity and attachments, though the M14 does have a slightly faster fire rate.Battlefield Play4Free  The M14 EBR us a weapon featured in Battlefield Play4Free for the Recon kit. It features a larger magazine, lower recoil, and a higher fire rate than other sniper rifles. However, the weapon also has a decreased range and firepower, as well as a cost of up to 899 P4F Funds for unlimited use. Its semi-automatic nature allows users to easily wield the weapon in close-range situations, like on Karkand, Sharqi, and Basra.Trivia External links SOFLAM  The SOFLAM (Special Operations Forces Laser Acquisition Marker) is a laser designator for specific range-finding and locating critical targets for destruction using guided ordnance.Battlefield 3  The SOFLAM is a Recon gadget in Battlefield 3. It is deployed as a fixed weapon like the M224 Mortar, but is used for laser designation of targets for guided weaponry. Once set into a suitable area, the player can control it remotely (like the EOD Bot or the MAV). The SOFLAM is semi-autonomous and will designate targets even when unattended. Even if other players cannot provide guided weaponry, the player still benefits from having a remote camera with which to spot enemies and range targets. The monochrome (black & white) day-vision camera has two levels of zoom. At the bottom of the display are azimuth (heading), range and elevation metrics. Once an enemy vehicle has been designated, friendly unit's damage against that target is increased. \"Painting\" or lasing a target with the SOFLAM will give a \"target designated\" bonus of 10 points. The SOFLAM allows the Javelin to lock on to air vehicles, where it normally would not be able to. Because of its higher damage, this tactic is extremely effective, especially when enemies are repairing air units in flight. Enemies who discover the SOFLAM can destroy it, even with light weapons, so secure terrain is recommended for the device to remain intact. The SOFLAM also has an effect similar to a Laser Sight when aimed at a vehicle or person, allowing them to quickly locate the device. Worse still, it's recognizable as a Vehicle, same with the M224 Mortar, the enemy can lock on to a manned SOFLAM with their own Guided Missile/Shell. Operators of the SOFLAM must note not to use it while in close proximity to the device, as splash damage from counter-attacks by enemy guided munition can kill the operator. Lock-on Time: 2 secondsBattlefield 4  The SOFLAM is a gadget featured in Battlefield 4. It as one of two laser designators for the Recon class, the other being the PLD. The range for the SOFLAM for air targets is 500m, compared to the PLD's 300m range for air targets. The SOFLAM also comes with a target range calculator, but unlike the PLD, only displays range of vehicles. The SOFLAM remains relatively unchanged to its Battlefield 3 predecessor in both function and appearance. Once set into a suitable area, the player can control it remotely (similar to the EOD Bot or the MAV). The SOFLAM is semi-autonomous and will designate targets even when unattended. Even if other players cannot provide guided weaponry, the player still benefits from having a remote camera with which to spot enemies and range targets.

Vehicles not listed are vehicles which are instantly destroyed upon munition impact at any angle. Such includes\u00a0Jets of all Types (Laser designation only), Quad Bikes, and\u00a0PWCs. Damage resulting from impacts are consistent from any angle of impact and by any type of compaitable guided munition. Damage results are gathered post-2015\u00a0Battlefield 4: Legacy Operations\u00a0update and are subject to change without notice by game developers from time to time.USAS-12  The USAS-12 is a modern Korean-made, fully automatic, gas-operated, fully-ambidextrous\u00a012-gauge shotgun developed during the 1980s by Daewoo Precision Industries. The users of the USAS-12\u00a0are not known, but it is speculated to be in service with various southeast-Asian law-enforcement and military units.Battlefield: Bad Company  The USAS12 is a weapon featured in Battlefield: Bad Company and is obtained by completing a certain \"Find-All-Five\" challenge. One must simply check their stats online (see External Links) and it will be unlocked the next time the player signs in. Or you can enter the code aw3somef1rep0wer. Only accessible through multiplayer, it is issued to the Demolition class. It is the only automatic shotgun, but it is balanced out by a lower rate of fire. It is capable of killing within 3 or so shots. Its main downsides come from its somewhat low magazine size (10 shells) and fairly uncontrollable recoil.Battlefield: Bad Company 2  The USAS-12 Auto is a weapon featured in Battlefield: Bad Company 2.Singleplayer  The USAS-12 Auto uses a 12 round magazine. It retains its fully-automatic fire mode, and is found as a collectible in Snowblind, but has several appearances throughout the singleplayer mode, such as when it is used by Russian forces in Sangre del Toro,\u00a0and some elite units in Zero Dark Thirty\u00a0and\u00a0Force Multiplier, and given to the player character in Airborne. The USAS-12 with 12 Gauge Slugs can be found in an opened ship container just before some stairs at the beginning of the level Crack the Sky. Both versions of the gun are collectibles.Multiplayer  The USAS-12 Auto is the last shotgun issued to all kits, unlocked at rank 21. It is fully automatic and has a 6 round magazine. The USAS-12 has almost exactly the same weapon stats as the Saiga 20K except for it being automatic. With 12 Gauge Slugs, it can be used as a sort of burst-fire assault rifle, although it suffers from a small magazine, a low rate of fire, and high recoil, as well as a steep increase in spread per shot. It is a very good idea to apply the Extended Shotgun Magazine specialization to the USAS-12, as it doubles its capacity to a total of 12 shells per magazine and greatly increases its potential to take on multiple targets.Battlefield Play4Free  Three variants of the USAS-12 appear in Battlefield Play4Free.USAS-12  The USAS-12 is an all-kit weapon unlocked at level 17 for the cost of 400  per day or 999  for unlimited use. It retains its fully-automatic firemode, but gains the ability to use iron sights. It comes with a standard 6-round magazine. It is not recommended you buy this gun permanently unless you have a great amount of funds, since most servers ban this shotgun.Veteran's USAS-12  The Veteran's USAS-12 features a higher damage over the standard USAS-12 and a larger magazine of 8 rounds. The cost for unlimited use is 1879 . The gun's appearance is rugged, but the differences with the standard USAS are very small, unlike other Veteran's guns. The gun now costs 750 credits after the Dec. 1st updates.Elite's USAS-12  The Elite's USAS-12 does even more damage per pellet than the Veteran's version and has a larger magazine of 10 rounds to further increase its usefulness. The cost of this gun is 3749  for unlimited use or 2500  per day. The weapon has a very clean appearance, like all of the elite weapons, and sports a tan paint scheme on the stock, pistol grip and handguard. This gun is very similar to the Saiga-12, being equal or superior in almost every aspect: both have the same damage, but the USAS has a higher rate of fire, being fully automatic, but its magazine holds four less rounds, yet it costs less Battlefunds and can be temporary bought with in-game credits.Battlefield 3  The USAS-12 is a weapon featured in\u00a0Battlefield 3. The shotgun fires in semi-automatic mode and fully auto and has a rate of fire of 300 rounds per minute and fires at a lower rounds per minute if firing 12 Gauge Frag rounds. Firing rapidly produces heavy recoil for a shotgun. It has magazine size of six rounds or ten with Extended Magazine, plus one in the chamber if reloaded with rounds left over.Singleplayer  The USAS-12 is used by the private guards in the mission\u00a0Kaffarov. It can be found on several enemies during the later part of the level. Extended Mags and Russian Optics are the most common attachments.Co-op  The USAS-12 can be found in the level Hit And Run. It's useful when clearing rooms and grouped enemies.Multiplayer  The USAS-12 is unlocked at Rank 43\u00a0as an all-kit weapon. The weapon is very effective in close quarters situations.\u00a0Even though the USAS-12 has a generous magazine capacity, the automatic firing will deplete it quickly leading to frequent reloads. The USAS-12 is plagued with a long reload time despite the box feeding taking between 2.5 and 3.5 seconds depending on whether the weapon is emptied or not. The USAS-12 fires the absolute lowest pellet count per shot, has the highest spread tied with MK3A1. With any ammunition loaded, its effectiveness decreases much faster than any other shotgun outside of point blank range, as it needs at least 6 out of 7 pellets to connect with a torso in order to make a kill inside of 8 meters. which, coupled with the high spread, is highly optimistic at 8 meters and beyond. Note that with Flechette Ammunition a one-shot kill would require 8 pellets, meaning that a one-shot kill is not possible unless it is a point-blank headshot. The MK3A1 on the contrary, has a higher magazine at 8 + 1 by default or 12 + 1 with Extended Magazines, as well as a slower reload, giving balance to the USAS-12's one less pellet per shot comparatively. However, the USAS-12 has a faster rate of fire and reload time compared the MK3A1. With 12 Gauge Slugs or 12 Gauge Frags, the USAS-12 can be used at much further ranges as more of a high-power, semi-automatic rifle at the cost of losing its edge in close quarters. It requires at least two shots to kill, while it can take up to four at longer ranges. If equipping the USAS-12 with a 3.4x, 4x or 6x scope, it's highly recommended to switch to semi-auto as it can help increase the effective range of the weapon on maps with larger sight lines, but players using these scopes will need to account for bullet drop against targets at long ranges. It's also worth noting that slugs have a very slow travel time and have a small effective range. At close range, optics are of much less concern as the USAS-12 with Buckshot or Flechette generally does not need to be aimed, although it will be more accurate if the player chooses to do so. A Laser Sight can improve its hip-fire accuracy greatly. A Flash Suppressor can help lower recoil for multiple shots at longer ranges with Slugs or Frags, or to decrease the player's firing signature in close range in darker areas when firing due to the flash from the weapon when firing being significantly reduced.  Extended Magazines is a highly recommended option for close quarters as it gives the USAS-12 four more rounds in the magazine and allows it to be able to fire more often and reload less often while still having the same ammunition count as without them applied. A Tactical Light can also help as close ranges to potentially blind targets, especially those with IRNV scopes, and to get the edge over them in close ranges if the player is assaulting a well defended area such as an objective in Rush.Battlefield 4  The USAS-12 is a Shotgun featured in Battlefield 4.Singleplayer  The USAS-12 is an unlockable weapon obtained by completing the Gold assignment on South China Sea by scoring 10,000 points. It has a Prisma (3.4x) and Compensator attached, and fires 12G Slug rounds. It sports a Worm Woodland finish.Multiplayer  The USAS-12 can be found as a Battle Pickup weapon, equipped with 12 Gauge Frag rounds, a Holographic Sight, a Laser/Light Combo, and an\u00a0Ergo Grip. A variant with a FLIR sight, Angled Grip, and Laser/Light Combo, is also available, known as the USAS-12 FLIR. Additionally the USAS-12 is semi-effective against unarmored light vehicles (Such as Jeeps and Quad Bikes) and Naval Craft (such as RHIB Boats and PWCs); while inflicting only minimal damage to the vehicles themselves, the splash damage of the Frag rounds deals effective damage to occupying Infantry and drivers.Trivia Battlefield: Bad Company 2 Battlefield 3 Battlefield 4 External links M98B  The M98B is a bolt-action sniper rifle produced by Barrett Firearms Manufacturing, known for its M82/M107 .50 caliber anti-materiel rifle. The M98B is chambered for the .338 Lapua Magnum round, a cartridge that is widely regarded as a superior sniper round for its accuracy and conservation of energy over range. The weapon was designed in 1997 to create a non-sporting rifle based on the Lapua cartridge. Originally meant to be semi-automatic, the M98 was unveiled in 1998 but was nearly cancelled due to lack of interest. It was revived a few years later under the name M98B and has been produced since 2008.Battlefield Play4Free  The M98B is a weapon featured in Battlefield Play4Free, being introduced in an update.Battlefield 3  The M98B is a weapon featured in Battlefield 3. The weapon has moderate recoil, being the only sniper rifle in the game to fire .338 Magnum rounds. It has a rate of fire of 46 rpm with a magazine size of 5 + 1 rounds.Singleplayer  The M98B is only available in Operation Guillotine after the player arrives inside the bank. It is attached with a Bipod and a Ballistic Scope, having high accuracy and damage. It is capable of killing enemies in a single shot.Multiplayer  The M98B is issued to the Recon kit, available for use after reaching 146000 Recon score. It has a slightly slower fire rate than the M40A5, but higher damage. The weapon deals a one-hit kill to anything within 15 meters or any hit to the chest while playing Hardcore. This is because the M98B's minimum damage is 59 at anything past 120 meters, and in hardcore players only have 60 health. With a Silencer, the M98B can kill any target in the head, this can be used to silently pick off much further targets sniping (while still retaining its one shot kill ability in hardcore), At the cost of losing its OSK range in regular mode, requiring at least two shots to kill at any range. Equipping a 3.4, 4x or 8x scope can help increase the effective range of the weapon on maps with larger sight lines, but players using these scopes will need to account for bullet drop against targets at long ranges. A Laser Sight can improve its hip-fire accuracy a decent amount as well. A Bipod can work for long range sniping or players who have trouble with the straight pull-bolt and can help for multiple shots at longer ranges. The Straight Pull-Bolt can be used to track targets from far away without pulling out of sights.Battlefield 4  The M98B is a weapon featured in Battlefield 4, issued to the Recon kit as the second to last sniper rifle for 34,000 Sniper Rifle score. Notably, the M98B sports the third highest velocity and maximum range of the sniper rifles not including the Railgun. Due to its high velocity, it has little bullet drop, with only the SRR-61 and FY-JS outclassing it in this regard. Compared to Battlefield 3, the M98B in Battlefield 4 shares similar stats, except it has a slightly slower rate of fire, slightly better hipfire, and twice the magazine capacity at 10+1 rounds instead of 5+1 rounds. The M98B is arguably the best sniper rifle in the game for extremely long-range sniping, as its smaller amount of bullet drop as compared to most other sniper rifles gives it an advantage, as does its extremely high muzzle velocity. The addition of a Ballistic Scope can further augment the M98B's long-range capability. However, the M98B's low fire rate of 40 RPM makes it one of the worst sniper rifles in the game for close-quarters or medium-range combat, and it is best kept to long-range engagements.Battlefield Hardline  The M98B is a bolt-action sniper rifle introduced in the Battlefield Hardline: Betrayal expansion. It has extremely high damage at the cost of having the slowest fire rate of all bolt-action rifles. Videos:Trivia Battlefield 4 Battlefield Hardline See Also External links AEK-971  The AEK-971, is a Russian-made selective-fire assault rifle designed by Sergey I. Koksharov in the 1970s. Developed around a gas driven, balanced-action mechanism, the AEK eliminates several action impulses that cause recoil, resulting in substantial gain in accuracy during automatic fire compared to the AK-74. Originally a competitor in the Project Abakan trials during the late 20th century, a prototype of the AEK-971 was passed over in favor of the AN-94 for adoption by the Russian Army. In the early 2000s, a production version of AEK was adopted in small quantities by the Russian Internal Affairs Ministry (MVD) which reacted positively to the weapon. A successor variant known as the A-545 (GRAU designation 6P67) was officially adopted by the Russian military in 2017 alongside the AK-12. The prototype AEK-971 appears in the Bad Company series games and Battlefield Play4Free, while the production version appears in Battlefield 3 and Battlefield 4.Battlefield: Bad Company  The AEK-971 is a weapon featured in Battlefield: Bad Company.Singleplayer  The AEK-971 is the standard issue rifle of both Russian and Serdaristani soldiers. It is probably the most common weapon in the game - especially in the first few missions - making ammunition easy to come by, though it cannot be found during Ghost Town where the AUG replaces it. It is a decent replacement for the default M416 as its sights are more open, but its stats are exactly the same. It also comes equipped with a GP-30 with 40mm grenades.Multiplayer  The AEK-971 is issued as the default assault rifle to the Russian Assault Kit. Its US Army counterpart is the M416 and its MEC counterpart is the AUG A3. Like all assault rifles in the game, it has 50 rounds in each magazine and the player will have 150 rounds in reserve. It will have the GP-30 as its grenade launcher with 8 grenades. It has very average stats, balanced between moderate power, moderate fire rate and mediocre accuracy, as well as open sights. It can kill in about 8-10 shots.Battlefield: Bad Company 2  The AEK-971 Vintovka is a weapon featured in Battlefield: Bad Company 2.Singleplayer  The AEK-971 Vintovka is no longer the standard weapon for Russian infantry, unlike in the previous game, having been replaced in that role by the AN-94. Instead, it is primarily found in the hands of the Latin American Militia. It can be found either with iron sights or a Red Dot Sight. The version with the Red Dot Sight can be found as a collectible in Upriver, underneath the destroyed bridge.Multiplayer  The AEK-971 Vintovka is the first assault rifle issued to the Assault kit. It is nearly the same as the M16A2 in terms of stats. It has 30 rounds per magazine. It has medium firepower and decently low spread. The recoil is very low for its rate of fire, but is enough to throw off the player's aim beyond medium range. But, short controlled bursts can make the gun deadly at long range. The iron sights are very open, but the recoil pattern makes the gun move back and forth in first person, and resettles very slowly, meaning continuous fire leaves the player with nothing to rely on for aiming besides their eyes.iOS  For the iOS edition, the AEK-971 is the primary weapon for both the Russian forces and the Latin American Militia. It has a 30-round magazine and 120 in reserve. Despite it being an assault rifle, it doesn't have an under-barrel grenade launcher.Battlefield Play4Free  The AEK-971 is a weapon featured in Battlefield Play4Free as a purchasable weapon for the Assault Kit. It is one of the most common weapons seen in games due to the high damage and decent accuracy, as well as being one of the first fully automatic assault rifles in the game. The AEK-971 has above-average stats and performs well in close to medium range engagements. The AEK-971 can be bought for 300  for a day or 45,000  to have forever with credits. It can also be bought for 69  for a day, 179  for a week, and 499  for a month with Play4Free Funds.Battlefield 3  The AEK-971 is a weapon featured in Battlefield 3. It has somewhat changed in appearance compared to past counterparts. It now has a folding wire stock and a different handguard,(due to it being modeled on the production version instead of the prototype) with also an all black finish. It has a high rate of fire with open sights and moderate recoil. The reload animation of the AEK-971 is nearly identical to the AN-94, with the player hitting the magazine release with the new magazine.Singleplayer  It is seen widely during the campaign used by the Iranian and PLR forces, and is the starting weapon for Dima in Kaffarov after he opens the weapons cache. It is last seen in The Great Destroyer being used by PLR cell operatives.Co-Op  It can rarely be found in the mission Hit and Run. It is most commonly found with a Tactical Light, but can also be found with a Kobra or PKA-S.Multiplayer  It is the fourth Assault Rifle unlocked at 60,000 Assault points. It has three firing modes; semi-automatic, burst and fully automatic. The weapon's very high rate of fire makes it most effective at close range, and has the lowest vertical recoil of all vanilla (pre-DLC) assault weapons. However, the high and unpredictable horizontal recoil combined with the high first shot recoil can make fully automatic fire difficult at medium to long range. The high rate of fire also causes the weapon to recoil and come off target rather quickly. This high rate of fire also makes it easy to empty the magazine quickly even on individual targets. The AEK-971 also supports the Underslung Rail attachment which can be used to attach the M320 grenade launcher, which conjuncts into the GP-30. However, the rail cannot fit the M26 MASS shotgun to the rifle. This is because of its larger size than the M320.Battlefield 4  The AEK-971 is a weapon featured in Battlefield 4. Its iron sights are unchanged from its Battlefield 3 variant, but the AEK-971 now has a green handguard by default reminiscent of its Bad Company counterpart.Singleplayer  The AEK-971 can be found as a collectible in Tashgar. It is found resting against green crates on top of the first concrete building in the field after exiting the tunnel. \u00a0It is equipped with a PKA-S, Magnifier, Heavy Barrel, and Potato Grip. It sports an Atomic Naval finish.Multiplayer  The AEK-971 is the fourth assault rifle unlocked for the Assault kit, after the SAR-21 and before the FAMAS, requiring 28,000 assault rifle score. Its appearance and mechanics are very similar to its counterpart in Battlefield 3. The rate of fire remains at 900 rounds per minute (RPM), making the AEK-971 the second fastest-firing assault rifle right behind FAMAS at 1,000 RPM. Thus being an excellent choice at close range combat, but requiring shorter bursts when engaging targets at medium and long ranges. This weapon has a somewhat slow reload time compared to other Assault Rifles, so one should consider where and when to reload, as to not be killed during a firefight due to the longer reload. The AEK-971 can mount the GP-30 grenade launcher on the Underslung Rail when the M320 is equipped, but not the M26 MASS. It unlocks the Russian optics, and can only acquire the US and Chinese variants through Battlepacks.Trivia General Battlefield: Bad Company Battlefield: Bad Company 2 Battlefield Play4Free Battlefield 3 G3  The G3 (German: Gewehr 3; English: Rifle 3), is a battle rifle designed in 1959 and manufactured by German small arms producer Heckler & Koch. It is a selective-fire weapon chambered for the 7.62x51mm NATO cartridge, is typically fed from a 20-round detachable box magazine, and has a fire rate of 500 to 600 rounds per minute depending on the variant. A wide variety of non-military variants are also in production, typically sporting smaller magazines, semi-auto only, and other modifications to comply with various regulations.Battlefield 2  The G3 is the Tier 1 unlock for the Assault Kit in Battlefield 2. The G3 has a higher than average damage for an assault rifle, coupled with average fire rate, spread, and recoil values. It requires at minimum two rounds to kill, but may take as many as four depending on round placement. It also has one of the lowest magazine capacities out of the assault rifles. One feature of the G3 is that when it is in use, the player will be equipped with hand grenades instead of a grenade launcher.Battlefield: Bad Company 2  The G3 is a weapon featured in Battlefield: Bad Company 2.Multiplayer  The G3 is the last battle rifle issued to all kits requiring the achievement of Rank 22. The G3 uses a 20 round magazine, is fully automatic, and can be modified with a Red Dot Sight or a 4X Rifle Scope. It has a low fire rate combined with high power, and, as with the LMGs, each successive shot decreases overall spread. The G3 is one of the weapons that has a 50% recoil decrease when crouching, making crouching a better option for long range targets. The G3 handles and performs roughly similar to the M14 in the Vietnam expansion pack for Bad Company 2.Battlefield Play4Free  The G3A4 is a weapon featured in Battlefield Play4Free as the default assault rifle for the Assault Kit. Its reload time is on par with many other available assault rifles, but it has the lowest average damage output of all assault rifles, as well as fairly moderate recoil that pulls more right than left. The weapon can be equipped with attachments to increase performance aspects: the Stand-off Barrel increases range; Soft Point Ammo increases damage at all ranges; a Tactical Stock reduces overall deviation. Casket Mags and High Capacity Mags raise its capacity to 36 rounds per magazine, or 28 rounds per magazine (respectively), and provide an extra magazine on spawn.Battlefield 3  The G3A3 is a weapon featured in Battlefield 3.Singleplayer and Co-op  In the singleplayer and co-op modes, the G3A3 is very common among the PLR and the Iranian Army, and can be found with or without optics.Multiplayer  The G3A3 is unlocked for multiplayer when an overall score of 160,000 points are reached in Co-op. Formerly (before the R3 patch), 441,000 points needed to be achieved in Co-Op to unlock it. The G3A3's relatively low rate of fire, high recoil, high hipfire spread and low magazine capacity leaves it somewhat disadvantaged at close range; however, it makes up for this with its high damage output. Its high minimum damage and an almost unrivaled degree of accuracy make it excel at longer distances where most other assault rifles would prove too inaccurate or low-powered. The G3A3 has been returned to its original state since the March 27 Patch. The current maximum damage for the G3A3 is 34 while all the other assault rifles' maximum damages are 25, and its minimum damage is 22 while the rest of the assault rifles' minimum damages are 18.4. This makes it a 3-shot kill at close range and a 5 shot kill at long range, both the lowest required on any assault rifle. The G3A3 also has the highest minimum damage range of any of the assault rifles, being 60 meters instead of the usual 50. Adding a heavy barrel will extend the minimum damage range to a highly unusual 90 meters, and, more importantly, allow the G3A3 to kill an enemy in 4 hits at 60 meters, where other assault rifles need 6. Also worth noting, is that shots from the G3A3 will, like other 7.62mm weaponry, suppress enemies more than regular small arms. As a disadvantage the G3A3 also has the lowest bullet velocity of the assault weapons at 500 m/s, and thus has the lowest maximum range as well of 750m. It also possesses a high hipfire spread, comparable to a semi-automatic sniper rifle. The G3A3 supports the Underslung Rail attachment which can be used to attach the M26 MASS shotgun, but it cannot mount the M320 grenade launcher; the M320 must be used as a standalone weapon.Battlefield Hardline  The PTR-91 is a purchasable semi-automatic sniper rifle for the Professional kit, costing $3,300 to unlock. The PTR-91 is equipped with a JGM-4, Suppressor, and Extended Magazines by default. It handles similarly to the Saiga .308, but has more recoil. However, it has a larger standard magazine capacity and its default Suppressor can be useful to a stealth-minded Professional player.Trivia Battlefield: Bad Company 2 Battlefield Play4Free Battlefield 3 AN-94  The AN-94 (Russian: \"\u0410\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0442 \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430 1994\" Avtomat Nikonova 1994; English: Automatic Nikonov model 1994), also known as the Abakan or 6P33, is an advanced Russian assault rifle designed by Gennadiy Nikonov from 1980-1994. The AN-94 Abakan fires the 5.45x39mm round which is a lighter and more accurate than the powerful 7.62x39mm round. It uses a few features of the AK-74, such as the 30 round magazine and the pistol grip, but is otherwise a completely new gun. It has a special 2 round burst setting, utilizing a system known to Russians as \"blowback shifted pulse\", that negates the recoil until after the second round has fired, so that accuracy isn't compromised.Battlefield: Bad Company  The AN94 is a weapon featured in Battlefield: Bad Company.Singleplayer  The AN94 can be found on the mission Crossing Over as a collectable. At the very beginning, at Russo-Serdaristani border, it is in one of the houses. It can also be found off of dead Serdaristani soldiers during Air Force One.Multiplayer  The AN94 is issued to the Assault kit. The AN-94 is unlocked by either buying the Gold Edition of Battlefield: Bad Company or by reaching the highest rank (Rank 25, General of the Army). It has a 50 round magazine and 150 rounds in reserve, and an attached GP-30. It is fully automatic and has the second highest rate of fire of the assault rifles, second to the F2000, which is balanced by lower damage. It takes around 12-15 shots to kill an enemy. It is a generally poor choice for long range, as its high rate of fire can easily cause a player to overshoot, and its awkward iron sights can be difficult to use, especially with the gun's muzzle flash. However, it's a great choice for close quarters, where a spray and pray tactic can be quite effective.Battlefield: Bad Company 2  The AN-94 Abakan is a weapon featured in Battlefield: Bad Company 2.Singleplayer  The AN-94 is the standard issue rifle for the Russian Army throughout the campaign, and comes with a Red Dot Sight, but they can also be found with a 4X Rifle Scope as seen in the level Zero Dark Thirty, where it is held by a Russian soldier rappelling from a transport helicopter before the part where Marlowe is hit by a flashbang.Multiplayer  The AN-94 Abakan requires 28000 points for the Assault class to unlock. In-game, the AN-94 fires in a two-round burst. Despite this, it is possible to fire the weapon almost as though it were fully automatic. If the player fires as fast as the game allows, it fires at an average rate of 600 RPM, around that of the UMP-45. Due to the accuracy that comes from its two round burst, the AN-94 is often used for counter-sniping and ranged combat, much like the M16A2. However, these weapons are not ideal for such long ranges because the high vertical recoil given off by the first shot and the relatively long time for the gun to reset will often let the sniper escape after having being hit by one or two bullets. The AN-94 is commonly used in conjunction with Magnum Ammo as the increased damage output provides a more noticeable and arguably more beneficial improvement at all ranges when compared to Marksman Training. This weapon has clearly defined iron sights, much like the G3. However, the AN-94's sights obstruct a considerable portion of the screen surrounding the target. The iron sights may be satisfactory but they can reduce the player's awareness at most ranges, a 4X Rifle Scope is a good complement to the weapon's accuracy at medium range while the Red Dot Sight will help improve the player's awareness in close range engagements often experienced in Squad Deathmatch. Like the M60, the AN-94 was originally much more powerful than it became through patches. Its close range damage was about 20, making it more powerful than most other assault rifles. However, its damage was reduced to 16.7, that of the AUG, XM8 and M416. This gave the assault rifle the lowest damage per second due to its slow rate of fire; coupled with the longest reload and second highest recoil, the popularity of the AN-94 quickly diminished due to the patches. It can still be used very effectively in medium to long range situations, even its alleged weakness at close quarters can be easily overcome by quickly firing from the hip.Battlefield Play4Free  The AN-94 Abakan is a weapon featured in Battlefield Play4Free for the Assault kit. Even though its rate of fire is lower than other assault rifles, it is unique in that it fires two shots at the same time per click, unlike the M16A2 that fires each bullet in succession after a single mouse click. This gives the AN-94 the illusion of a very high fire rate. Combined with its high damage (assuming both of the bullets fired per shot connect with their target) and easily controllable recoil when fired at a moderate pace, it is a very powerful weapon and only suffers at close range due to its \"decreased\" fire rate. It is more suited to medium to long range engagements, and users should try to stay away from close-quarters battles.Battlefield 3  The AN-94 is a weapon featured in Battlefield 3.Singleplayer  The AN-94 is only found amongst the VDV troops during Rock and a Hard Place, equipped with various sights (Kobra/PK-A/PKS-07/PSO-1) and other attachments (Foregrip,Heavy Barrels, Bipods, and Tactical lights).Multiplayer  The AN-94 is an all-faction weapon unlocked for the Assault kit once the player has reached 166,000 Assault score. It features burst and full-auto firemodes; however, unlike the other weapons with the same feature, the AN-94 is set by default to burst mode, and fires a two-round burst as opposed to the more common three-round-burst. The AN-94 is unique in that its burst fire mode is two times faster than its fully-automatic firemode: whereas the automatic firemode fires at a cyclic rate of 600 rounds per minute, the two round burst fires at a cyclic rate of 1,200 rounds per minute. However, achieving this rate of fire in a sustained fire is very hard, and for all but the most experienced players very inaccurate. But it can be devastating as the AN-94 is capable of out-shooting any other assault rifle, faster than even the FAMAS. The AN-94 can lose in close quarters combat to other high fire rate weapons due to its low automatic fire rate, unless two-round burst mode is used. The AN-94 also has the third highest vertical recoil of the assault-kit weapons, just after the FAMAS and G3A3. Though its recoil is considerably high, its first shot recoil is not. On fully automatic, the second shot can still hit a target at a medium range. On two round burst, the first shot multiplier is zero, meaning that there is no recoil at all between the first and second shots. This results in extremely precise bursts, allowing for both of the shots to land very close to one another. Only the spread affects the rifle. This tight bullet grouping allows for effective engagement of very long range targets on the burst setting. Due to the behavior of the burst-fire mechanism, horizontal recoil is practically a non-existent issue, and as such, the Foregrip does little to help (if not directly damage) the AN-94's performance, as it detracts from the rifle's key strength, which is the extreme accuracy of the 2-round burst fire. The bipod can also be used on the AN-94, to significantly reduce felt recoil, which helps at longer distances to increase the firing pace of 2-round bursts, and increase damage potential.Battlefield 4  The AN-94 is an assault rifle introduced in the Weapons Crate Pack of Battlefield 4. It was added along with the other weapons included in the pack to the Community Test Environment on March 30, 2015 for Alpha testing. Like its Battlefield 3 counterpart, the AN-94 features a unique two-round burst firemode that substantially increases the weapon's accuracy and rate of fire. The AN-94 is unlocked for use by default alongside the AK-12. Unlike its Battlefield 3 counterpart, the Battlefield 4 AN-94 has a limiter on the frequency at which one can tap the burstfire, limiting its average rate of fire potential to 900 rpm. Still, it maintains an extremely high probability of both shots hitting the same target. While it is not as effective in full-auto fire as other weapons, due to its low rate of fire, the AN-94's higher fire rate and low first-shot recoil in burst mode allows it to potentially outgun most other weapons at medium range, due to its high precision.Trivia General Battlefield: Bad Company 2 Battlefield Play4Free Battlefield 3 Battlefield 4 External links SV-98  The SV-98 (Russian: C\u043d\u0430\u0439\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f B\u0438\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0430 1998 Snaiperskaya Vintovka 1998; English: Sniper rifle model 1998) is a Russian bolt action sniper rifle designed by Vladimir Stronskiy in 1998 and in production at IZHMASH JSC. It fires 7.62x54mmR rounds with an effective range of around 1 kilometer (1094 yards).Battlefield: Bad Company  The SV98 is a sniper rifle featured in Battlefield: Bad Company.Singleplayer  In singleplayer, all Russian snipers wield this weapon and thus, it is always found with the MP-443 Grach. It can be found on Crossing Over and Crash and Grab and is a collectible.Multiplayer  In multiplayer, the SV98 is the default sniper rifle for the Russian Recon kit. The weapon, like all bolt action rifles in-game, kills in a single headshot or a chest shot in close range and two shots to the body at long range. The weapon has a 7x scope attached by default. It also has some bullet travel time at long ranges. The M24 is its American equivalent and the GOL rifle is its MEC counterpart.Battlefield: Bad Company 2  Only available in multiplayer, the SV98 Snaiperskaya is the 3rd sniper rifle issued to the Recon kit, requiring 6,000 points to unlock. Because of the 3.25 damage multiplier, a single headshot will kill at any range; while a single body shot can also kill at short range, longer ranges will require two. The SV98 has the largest magazine (10 rounds) and highest rate of fire of any bolt-action rifle in the game. The default scope uses a stacked chevron-style reticule with windage meters to the sides, instead of the conventional crosshairs adorning the scopes of weapons such as the M24 or M95. Many players dislike this cluttered scope and prefer to use the M24 for this reason, although the scope can be useful for aiming a long-range shot since a chevron below can help you aim at the head or body of an enemy. Having the largest field of vision among the default sniper rifle scopes makes it easier to spot targets at extreme range. The SV98 can be fitted with several unlockable Specializations: the Red Dot Sight, the 4X Rifle Scope, the 12X High Power Scope, or an additional spotting scope. Like all bolt action rifles, the SV98 is affected by bullet drop and has some bullet travel time. This means that to hit a target consistently the player needs to aim above the target at long range and lead their shots if the target is moving. Attaching a Red Dot Sight or 4x Scope to the weapon will not cause the bullet drop to disappear; the scopes magnify the bullet drop as well as one's target, meaning it will be more noticeable with a higher power zoom.Battlefield Play4Free  The SV-98 is the starting rifle to the Recon Kit. It features low damage for a sniper rifle so three body shots are needed to kill an enemy at extreme ranges. It has six rounds per magazine and starts with two magazines.Battlefield 3  In Battlefield 3, the SV98 is the first weapon unlock and bolt-action sniper rifle for the Recon class. Due to the fact it is unlocked fairly early, it is one of the most common sniper rifles in the game. The SV98 deals less damage than other bolt-action sniper rifles at range, and also reaches it's minimal 20 meters earlier than other sniper rifles. While it bears no remarkable statistics relevant for long range shooting, it's worth noting that the SV98 has the most accurate hipfire spread amongst the bolt-action snipers in the game.Battlefield 4  The SV-98 appears in Battlefield 4.\u00a0Singleplayer  In the campaign, the SV-98 is the standard sniper rifle of the RGF.\u00a0It is equipped with a PKS-07, Range Finder, Muzzle Brake and Straight Pull Bolt. It sports an ERDL Woodland finish.Multiplayer  The SV-98 is unlocked at 13,000 sniper score. It features a middling RPM, velocity, maximum range and reload time. The SV-98's dominant feature is its tightest hip-fire spread compared to the other sniper rifles. It also features the fastest bullet drop, along with the Scout Elite.Trivia External links AUG  The Steyr AUG (German: Armee-Universal-Gewehr; English: Universal army rifle), also known as the STG.77 (German: Sturmgewehr 77; English: Assault rifle 77), is an Austrian, bullpup-configured 5.56x45mm assault rifle, designed in 1977 by Steyr Mannlicher GmbH & Co KG. The AUG is a battle-proven Austrian assault rifle widely known for its high performance and durability as well as its accommodating features, for example, the option for use by left-handed people or the easy to remove barrel making it adaptable to the situation. It also has a built-in rail system near the end of the barrel for mounting optics. The bullpup layout allows for a shorter overall length while maintaining barrel length. In the Battlefield games it is seen as the AUG A3, a modern variant that is able to fit optics and other attachments. The AUG was improved and adopted by the Australian Army in 1989 replacing the L1A1 SLR (FN FAL), and the limited M16 Rifle with rifles built locally by \"Thales Australia\" as the \"F88 Austeyr\". The AUG Para is a 9mm SMG variant of the AUG.Battlefield: Bad Company  The AUG is a weapon featured in Battlefield: Bad Company.Singleplayer  The AUG can be found off of fallen MEC infantry during the final mission, Ghost Town. The AUG is common amongst the MEC infantry, particularly around the beginning of the level, along with the 9A-91.Multiplayer  The AUG is the default assault rifle for the Middle Eastern Coalition Assault kit. Like all assault rifles in the game, the AUG has 50 rounds per magazine and 150 rounds in reserve. The AUG is equipped with the M203 and has 8 grenades. It is good for medium to long range combat and can kill with 8-10 shots. It is the MEC's equivalent to the American M416 and Russian AEK971.Battlefield: Bad Company 2  The STG.77 AUG is a weapon featured in Battlefield: Bad Company 2 and is the fourth assault rifle issued to the Assault kit requiring 20,000 exp to unlock. It has a 30 round magazine and an M203 grenade launcher, holding the second lowest rate of fire out of the automatic assault rifles (same rate of fire as the M416). The AUG has moderate but jumpy horizontal recoil which may make it hard to keep aimed at a distant target, it boasts effective close range power but tap firing is absolutely necessary at range. It has cluttered iron sights but they are still workable. The cluttered iron sights can be remedied by equipping either the Red Dot Sight or the 4X Rifle Scope for better ranged accuracy. If the player cannot get used to iron sights, different optics can be considered a good choice of Primary specialization.Battlefield Play4Free  The STG77AUG is a purchasable assault rifle for the Assault Kit in Battlefield Play4Free with a price of 1249  or 45,000 . It features low recoil and an increased magazine of 35 rounds over 30 seen in most other assault rifles. Another somewhat unique feature is that its recoil mainly pulls to the right; a common trait found in bullpup weapons. Its low recoil and increased accuracy make it a good choice for larger and more open maps, although its sights can be obtrusive.Battlefield 3  The AUG A3 is an assault rifle featured in the Battlefield 3 Close Quarters expansion pack and is unlocked upon completion of the Shepard assignment. The entire weapon has a slightly less obtrusive profile when at the hip when compared to previous iterations of the weapon, and its sight picture follows suit, being virtually identical but seemingly thinner than the Bad Company variations. Unlike most other bullpup assault rifles, the AUG A3 is capable of mounting the M320 grenade launcher or the M26 shotgun underslung as opposed to standalone. The weapon has very controllable recoil, partially due to its average rate of fire, and performs well at both medium and close ranges.Battlefield 4  The AUG A3 reappears as an assault rifle in Battlefield 4. The iron sights are average, but an optic is more practical for more precise targeting. Because of the AUG A3's controllable rate of fire, high bullet velocity, and minimal recoil, it is best suited for engagements at medium to long range. However, because the AUG A3 is bullpup, it is still very usable at close range with tighter hipfire and faster ADS speed. Overall it is one of the more balanced assault rifles in the game, offering a steady firerate, small recoil and excellent accuracy, only falling short in close quarters to weapons like the AEK-971 or FAMAS. Similar to Battlefield 3, the AUG A3 has an unusually high bullet velocity at 670m/s, giving it one of the fastest bullet velocities in the game, slightly faster than even the high powered sniper rifles like the M98B and SRR-61. However, the AUG A3 has a faster bullet drop of 15 m/s\u00b2.Singleplayer  The AUG A3 is an unlockable weapon obtained by completing the Silver assignment in the mission\u00a0Kunlun Mountains by scoring 7,000 points.It is equipped with a HOLO, Magnifier and Ergo Grip. It sports a Worm Urban finish.Multiplayer  The AUG A3 is the third to last Assault Rifle unlocked with 48,000 Assault Rifle points.\u00a0It unlocks the US attachments first and can only unlock the\u00a0Russian\u00a0and\u00a0Chinese\u00a0attachments through\u00a0Battlepacks.\u00a0 Unlike most bullpup assault rifles, it can equip\u00a0Underslung Rail, but it cannot mount any M26  variants, only M320  variants: equipping an M26 variant will still cause one to carry it separately.Battlefield Hardline  The AUG A3 is an assault rifle released with the Battlefield Hardline: Betrayal expansion, available to the Operator kits of both factions.Trivia Battlefield: Bad Company 2 Battlefield 3 Battlefield Play4Free Battlefield 4 Battlefield Hardline External links F2000  The FN F2000 (French: Fusil 2000; English: Rifle 2000) is a bullpup assault rifle made by the Belgian firearms company FN Herstal. Designed in the late 1990s, the F2000 is a compact assault rifle that fires the 5.56x45mm NATO round, allowing the F2000 to be deadly at medium range yet compact and easy to carry, due to its bullpup configuration. FN's GL1 grenade launcher can be attached to the weapon's handguard. The F2000 has a high rate of fire compared to other assault rifles (850 rounds per minute) and can use STANAG magazines from most NATO assault rifles.Battlefield 2  The F2000 is an Assault Rifle featured in Battlefield 2. Its rate of fire, damage, and spread are average for the assault rifles. Like most of the other assault rifles, it comes equipped with a grenade launcher -- the underslung GL1. However, alongside the L85A1, the F2000 is unique in its addition of an optic instead of iron sights.Battlefield: Bad Company  The F2000 is an assault rifle featured in Battlefield: Bad Company. For the Assault kit. The weapon is unlocked through the \"Find All Five\" program for Battlefield Veterans. The weapon no longer is able to be unlocked due to an error in the Veteran ranking system. The F2000 has an extremely high rate of fire, making up for its low of damage and moderate accuracy.Battlefield: Bad Company 2  The F2000 Assault is an Assault Rifle featured in Battlefield: Bad Company 2.Singleplayer  The F2000 Assault is first encountered on Sangre Del Toro. It is equipped only with iron sights and its GL1 under-barrel grenade launcher. The iron sight version can be unlocked in Base Station Alpha. The red dot sight version can be first found in the detention camp in the mission No One Gets Left Behind. It is later encountered on Zero Dark Thirty equipped with a Red Dot Sight in addition to its grenade launcher, used by a Russian after Marlowe is hit by a flashbang grenade. It is a good alternative to Marlowe's standard rifle, the XM8 Prototype, as it can fulfill the close-range role of an SMG, without the smaller cartridge, or can equally be effective as a medium-range assault rifle that can take on all troops, including those with Type 88 LMG's or mounted KORD HMG's. Both variants of the F2000 are Collectible Weapons.Multiplayer  The F2000 is the third assault rifle issued to the Assault kit, requiring 8,000 points to unlock. It has the highest rate of fire of all assault rifles at 850 rpm with the cost of low damage per shot. This makes it somewhat effective in close quarters combat, but hard to use effectively at longer ranges much like an SMG, unless the user equips Magnum Ammunition. However, unlike an SMG, the F2000 has an attached GL1 grenade launcher, which gives the user an edge against opponents at medium range, especially if they are in cover. The weapon can be modified by adding a Red Dot Sight or 4X Rifle Scope, when unlocked for the Assault kit. The iron sights on the gun are rather small, but are effective for pinpoint accuracy, with a very prominent and thin front post. The F2000's main role is as a mobile assault rifle. It has the smallest hipfire spread of all assault rifles, whilst standing still or moving, and the smallest effect on spread whilst moving and aiming simultaneously of almost every weapon, only equal to the UZI and UMP-45.Battlefield Play4Free  The F2000 is a purchasable assault rifle for the Assault Kit in Battlefield Play4Free. It features decent damage output but at the cost of higher recoil. By default, it carries a 22-round magazine, but suffers from the second longest reload time behind the XM8 due to its bullpup nature. Because of the design of the weapon, it performs better in close quarters with a larger hip spread that can be beneficial at point-blank range. However, the weapon can have trouble engaging enemies past medium range. The F2000 is unlocked for use at rank 24, but can be purchased earlier for 9,999 . Once a player reaches rank 24, the F2000 can be bought for 350  or 299  for a day, or 60,000  or 1,999  to have forever, putting the F2000 in a mild price range among the other available assault rifles.Battlefield 3  The F2000 is a weapon featured in Battlefield 3Singleplayer  The F2000 can be picked up from enemies during the Singleplayer campaign in the missions Comrades, Kaffarov, and The Great Destroyer with a Holographic Sight. F2000s attached with zoom optics can be picked up from the PLR during the mission Night Shift.Co-Op  The F2000 is featured only in Drop 'Em Like Liquid and The Eleventh Hour, used by the PLR operatives. They are fitted with various US optics. In Drop 'Em Like Liquid, they are also seen with IRNV scopes and suppressors.Multiplayer  The F2000 can be unlocked at an Assault score of 124,000. It lacks the GL1 grenade launcher module and cannot accept underslung weapons such as the M320 and the M26 MASS due to its bullpup design, but can still accept the Foregrip and Bipod attachments due to its forward tactical rail. With a high rate of fire, the F2000 also has the highest and most unpredictable recoil of all intermediate assault weapons, as well as high spread. This high rate of fire and unpredictability makes the F2000\u00a0best suited for close quarters. This is further supported by its low spread when fired from the hip, as well as its relatively low spread while moving. This makes the F2000 an efficient weapon for close range advance while suppressing tactics. It's also worth noting that the F2000 along with the FAMAS has the largest base spread of any of the assault rifles with a staggering 0.4 value (comparable to a standard magazine fed LMG's) while aiming down the sights, further limiting their role at medium and long range. This high base spread is largely compensated by the lowest spread of any full-auto assault rifles when aiming down the sights on the move at 0.7, tied to L85A2 and lower than M16A3 (1.0). Battlefield Premium members can equip the Navy Blue Digital Camo for the F2000, or the Woodland Oak Camo by completing the F2000 Specialist assignment.Battlefield 4  The F2000 is a weapon featured in the Battlefield 4: Second Assault expansion. It is unlocked upon completion of the\u00a0Express Train assignment. The F2000 has a high rate of fire and moderately low muzzle rise and recoil making it an effective assault rifle for close to mid range battles. This is offset by a relatively long reload, especially the empty reload where the bolt is locked back then slapped forward when the magazine is inserted. As in Battlefield 2, it can equip a unique optic called the F2000 (1.6x). Like in Battlefield 3, it cannot mount any underbarrel attachments such as the Grenade Launcher or the M26 MASS due to its design.Battlefield Hardline  The F2000 is an Assault rifle introduced in the Robbery expansion for Battlefield Hardline, available for the Criminal Operator. The F2000 has good accuracy and damage, and is effective at medium ranges. Like its counterpart in Battlefield 2, it has no ironsights and is equipped with the F2000 (1.6x) scope when iron sights are selected.Trivia Battlefield 2 Battlefield: Bad Company Battlefield: Bad Company 2 Battlefield 3 Battlefield 4 External links M95  The M95 is a bullpup, bolt-action, anti-materiel sniper rifle chambered for .50 BMG (12.7x99 mm), designed by Barrett Firearms Manufacturing in 1995.\u00a0Battlefield 2  The M95 is a weapon featured in Battlefield 2 as a Tier One unlock for the Sniper kit. The M95 is a bolt-action rifle, with a magazine of five rounds (similar to all other the bolt-action rifles such as the M24 SWS). Its main improvement is a more powerful cartridge, the .50 BMG. The M95 is the only small arms able to deal 95% damage when fired on any part of the enemy (save for the lethal headshots) and to penetrate reinforced glass. Snipers on fairly\u00a0close/narrow\u00a0maps such as 32/64-sized Gulf of Oman and Wake Island 2007 like to use it because of its high penetration capabilities, as it is the only weapon capable of penetrating Helicopter and Jet Cockpit glass. Also, a few snipers use the M95 for long-range shooting, despite of\u00a0its high bullet-drop and\u00a0scope with relatively thick crosshairs.Battlefield 2: Modern Combat  The M95 is a weapon featured in Battlefield 2: Modern Combat as the standard sniper rifle issued to the USMC Sniper kit. It has very high firepower and good accuracy, but a slow rate of fire due to being a bolt-action sniper rifle.Battlefield: Bad Company  The M95 is a weapon featured in Battlefield: Bad Company.Singleplayer  The M95 can be found on Crash and Grab as a collectible, accompanied by an M9. It can be found in the large communications station at the base of the mountains. However, it is possible to acquire the weapon (and the M9) in Crossing Over by picking it up from a dead Legionnaire Sniper.Multiplayer  The M95 is an unlockable for the Recon kit. Despite being the most powerful sniper rifle in-game, it will not kill with one shot unless the enemy has taken some damage, is shot in the head or is at close range. It can also damage light vehicles and helicopters by a considerable amount due to its .50 caliber anti-material round.Battlefield Heroes  The M95 is a weapon featured in Battlefield Heroes and is available to be purchased for any Royal Commando. It was first released with the event \"Battlefield Heroes Gets Bad Company\" event. It was originally only purchasable for players over level 10, but that restriction was removed in December 2010 along with all other restricted weapons.Battlefield Online  The M95 is a sniper rifle that is featured in Battlefield Online.Battlefield: Bad Company 2 M95 Sniper  The M95 Sniper is a weapon featured in Battlefield: Bad Company 2.Singleplayer  The M95 can be found during Crack the Sky, on top of a watch outpost overlooking the communications building, and with a 4X Rifle Scope during No One Gets Left Behind, being used by a sniper in a watchtower during B-Company's assault on a Militia prison camp. As with the Type 88 Sniper, the player can kill an enemy AI in one hit to any part of the body at all ranges. However, as the Type 88 Sniper has double the magazine capacity and is semi-automatic, the M95 can seem the worse of the two weapons. The M95 does not have to compensate for bulletdrop over long distances however, while the Type 88 Sniper has.Multiplayer  The M95 Sniper is the 7th and last sniper rifle issued to the Recon kit, requiring 34,000 points to unlock. It has the slowest rate of fire for all sniper rifles, but has incredible penetration due to the .50 Caliber anti-materiel round. Due to the anti-materiel round, it can destroy a UAV-1 with one shot to any part. Despite its damage statistics, the M95 can only kill in one shot with a headshot, at close range, or if the enemy is already damaged. Otherwise, it takes two shots. The M95 also has the greatest one shot kill range. It is worth noticing that, for every meter after the 19 meter mark, the damage of the weapon drops by 2.5 per meter, making closing with targets a viable tactic. However, due to its slow aiming speed, keeping a fair distance, as well as a loaded pistol as backup, is recommended. Using magnum ammunition is a common tactic among Recon players, but this only allows the M95 to kill in one shot at slightly longer ranges. Attaching a Red Dot Sight or 4X Rifle Scope to the weapon will not cause the bullet drop to disappear; however, the scopes help magnify the bullet drop as well as the target. It can damage all vehicles except tanks (both light and heavy); it does 7-18% damage to helicopters and about 10% damage to light vehicles without using Magnum Ammunition. It is devastating against Personal Watercraft and Quad Bikes, providing the fast-moving vehicles can be hit.M95 SA  The M95 SA is also available to those who purchased the SPECACT DLC. It can be bought on Xbox live for 160MS points or through the Dr. Pepper/EA promotion, and for $1.99 at the PlayStation Store. This also comes with a differently textured outfit. The change is purely cosmetic. The SA Variant, unlike all other SA weapons, has one single finish to it due to the standard edition of the weapon being camouflaged. It instead has a matte black finish on all maps/environments, like many other weapons in the game.Battlefield Play4Free  The M95 is a purchasable sniper rifle that is featured in Battlefield Play4Free. It has the most damage for a sniper rifle on par with the M82A3. This benefit is offset by its slow bolt cycle, reload time, lower magazine capacity, and high recoil. It also is expensive at 979  for unlimited use after unlock. The weapon has great potential as a sniper as it works well at medium to very long ranges and can usually kill in two shots, or a single head-shot. The weapon's bullet drop over range is also lower than other snipers, but the vapor trail is larger as the bullet it fires is also considerably larger. The .50 BMG cartridge can penetrate all vehicles' armor except for main battle tanks. The weapon itself features a tan paint scheme on its upper frame and magazine well, similarly to the other Elite weapons.Enhanced Scope M95  The Enhanced Scope M95 is a separate version of the original M95 and features a variable zoom scope with two different magnification levels. While having exactly the same stats as the original M95, the Enhanced Scope M95 has a second increased zoom that can be used by the player scrolling the mouse wheel forward when viewing through the scope. Players can also return to the default zoom by scrolling the mouse wheel backward. The increased zoom magnifies distant targets to make them more visible to the player. However, the player will need to still account for bullet drop, even more so with the increased magnification. The Enhanced Scope M95 costs 150  for a day, 525  for a month, and 1050 for unlimited use.Trivia See Also External links FAMAS  The FAMAS (Fusil d'Assaut de la Manufacture d'Armes de Saint-Etienne, French for \"Assault Rifle of the Saint-Etienne weapon factory\") is a French-made assault rifle. Its development began in the late 60\u2019s during the Vietnam era and it is in wide usage within the French military today, adopted in 1978, as the service rifle of the French army. It uses a bullpup layout, and the F1 variant fires the 5.56mm NATO cartridge from a 25-round magazine, but the later G2 model can use 30-round NATO STANAG magazines. In all games but Battlefield 2, the FAMAS is a mix of a few variants of the real-life FAMAS assault rifle. It uses the outdated 25-round magazine from older F1 / G1 variants, the updated and enlarged trigger guard present on the newer G1 / G2 variants, and the lowered carrying handle of the redesigned G2 used in the F\u00c9LIN program.Battlefield 2  The FAMAS is a weapon featured in the Battlefield 2: Euro Force booster pack as the default rifle issued to the European forces' Medic kit. It is statistically very similar to the M16A2. It possesses damage, recoil, and rate of fire stats identical to that of the M16A2. Its spread stats are similar to the M16A2, although marginally higher, making it slightly less accurate than the M16A2. Along with the L85A1 and F2000, the FAMAS is special in that it comes pre-equipped with an optic as opposed to iron sights. It is also special in that it is capable of both fully automatic or three-round-burst firemodes.Battlefield Play4Free  The FAMAS is a purchasable weapon for the Assault kit in Battlefield Play4Free. It is a bullpup assault rifle that boasts the highest rate of fire amongst the available assault rifles. By default, it features medium damage, a 26-round magazine and a reload speed that is slightly slower than most of the other assault rifles. As the case with most bullpup weapons, the recoil of the FAMAS tends to pull mostly to the right and up. When aiming down sight and firing in bursts, the recoil is fairly easy to manage if the user is familiar with this recoil pattern.Battlefield 3  The FAMAS is a weapon featured in the Battlefield 3: Back to Karkand expansion. It was first seen on the \"Battlefield 3: Back to Karkand Gameplay Premiere Trailer\" with a Holographic Sight and a Laser Sight attached. It is the first unlockable assault weapon of the expansion pack and is obtained through the completion of the Best Friend Forever assignment. The FAMAS has the highest fire rate of all fully automatic weapons but is hindered by extremely obtrusive iron sights and muzzle which blocks much of the peripheral vision, making an optic a must. To further hinder its usage the recoil pulls up sharply, and bounces significantly from side to side. A small magazine size of 25 + 1 rounds, coupled with an extremely long reload time make getting caught off guard extremely detrimental. Additionally, it has the highest spread of the assault weapons when aiming down sights, on par with the F2000. The FAMAS has the highest rate of fire of the Assault Rifles and the quickest time to kill weapon in Battlefield 3 multiplayer closely followed by the M240B.Battlefield 4  The FAMAS appears in Battlefield 4.Singleplayer  The FAMAS is unlocked by completing the Bronze assignment in Shanghai by scoring 3000 points. It is equipped with a Reflex, flash Light, Compensator and Potato Grip. It sports a Worm Urban finish.Multiplayer  The FAMAS is an unlockable Assault Rifle in the Assault class. It has the highest rate of fire of any assault rifle at 1000 rounds per minute. However, it has one of the lowest stability stats, higher recoil and muzzle rise, \u00a0making long range engagements more difficult. It also holds only 25+1 rounds, 5 rounds less than the typical assault rifle. This, combined with its rate of fire, the FAMAS will drain ammo quickly and cause frequent reloads, which are also a problem due to the above average reload time, and the need for ammo. Like all other bullpup weapons in the game, it has a tighter hipfire spread making it more advantageous in close quarter battles. To compensate for the high recoil, long reload time and poor range, it is the fastest firing primary weapon in Battlefield 4, tied with the CZ-3A1. It is capable of shredding through other players in seconds, but at the hefty cost of ammo being drained extremley fast. A Stubby Grip and Compensator are strongly reccomended to help aid recoil.Battlefield Hardline  The FAMAS is an Assault rifle released alongside the Robbery expansion for Battlefield Hardline, available for the Operator for both factions. Like the M1A1, which was released alongside the Criminal Activity expansion, the FAMAS does not require ownership of the expansion and is available to all players.Trivia Battlefield 2 Battlefield Play4Free Battlefield 3 Battlefield 4 Battlefield Hardline External links QBU-88  The QBU-88, or Type 88, is a Chinese-made bullpup semi-automatic marksman rifle designed in the late 1980s by Norinco. By the first decade of 2000s, it was deployed in increasing numbers by the Chinese People's Liberation Army primarily among 1st grade mechanized outfits. It replaced the local copy of the SVD, the Type 85 rifle. In addition to military arm, the Chinese People's Armed Police Force as well as some local police forces adopted the QBU-88 as part of their sharpshooter's arsenal as well. The rifle uses the 5.8x42mm DBP88 cartridge from a 10-round box magazine with an effective range of 800 meters.Battlefield 2  The Type 88 is a weapon featured in Battlefield 2 and is the standard Sniper Rifle for the People's Liberation Army in the game. It has lower damage than the MEC's SVD, but it has higher accuracy. A Type 88 will kill unarmored infantry in 3 torso hits, while an armored soldier may take up to 4 hits to eliminate at times. A headshot will provide an instantaneous kill.Battlefield 2: Modern Combat  The Type 88 is a weapon featured in Battlefield 2: Modern Combat and is the standard sniper rifle issued to the PLA Sniper Kit. It has high firepower and good accuracy, but a low rate of fire due to functioning as a bolt-action sniper rifle. Despite dealing very high damage, the action of cycling the bolt can be fairly slow, so it's advisable to use the QSZ-92 when dealing with enemies up close.Battlefield: Bad Company  The QBU-88 is a weapon featured in Battlefield: Bad Company and is unlocked by completing a Find-all-Five! challenge. For those who pre-ordered the game, a code was given to unlock the weapon. DICE later released a universal code to unlock the weapon. The code is . It is a semi-automatic sniper rifle and takes about 3-4 shots to take down an enemy through body shots. It has a 10 round magazine and 40 rounds in reserve. However, unlike the SVU, the QBU-88 has no suppressor, which can easily give away the position of a sniper.Battlefield: Bad Company 2  The Type 88 Sniper is a weapon featured in Battlefield: Bad Company 2.Singleplayer  The Type 88 Sniper is the default weapon in Upriver. It can also be found with a Red Dot Sight on Heart of Darkness after the first weapon crate drops next to a building, and being used by an enemy in \"Crack the Sky\". Both variants of it are Collectible weapons. It is one of the two snipers in the Singleplayer game, the other being the M95. However, both snipers can kill in one shot to the body, and as the Type 88 is semi-automatic and has a 10 round magazine, it has a superior rate of fire.Multiplayer  The Type 88 Sniper is the second sniper rifle issued to the Recon requiring 1300 points. It is semi-automatic, and therefore has a significantly higher rate of fire than bolt-action sniper rifles, but is balanced by the fact that it is less accurate, has higher recoil and deals less damage (headshots are not one hit kills unless using Magnum Ammunition and other shots require a few hits) than the bolt-action sniper rifles. The weapon can also be modified with a Red Dot Sight, a 4X Rifle Scope, 12X High Power Scope, and/or Spotting Scope. It has exactly the same stats as the SVU, except in terms of reload time. However, the recoil pattern on the SVU is significantly longer than that of the Type 88, making it easier for the Type 88 to put the second/third killing round on target.Battlefield 3  The QBU-88 is a weapon introduced in the Battlefield 3: Back to Karkand expansion and is unlocked upon the completion of the Specops assignment. It holds 10+1 rounds per magazine.Patch History  There was a glitch where the weapon would appear at the top of the screen with the player's arms stretched out, blocking the player's view. While you could ADS to remove the weapon and zoom in, there was no indication of where the bullet would land and no scope. This glitch only happened on the Back to Karkand expansion maps, but was patched in a recent update. The weapon also suffered a glitch when deployed with the bipod. The weapons sights, including irons, were wrongly placed, aiming lower than the real bullet point of impact. This has been fixed during the patch 1.07.Battlefield 4  The QBU-88\u00a0is featured in Battlefield 4.Singleplayer  The QBU-88 is unlocked by completing the Gold assignment in Tashgar by scoring 14,000 points. It is equipped with a JGM-4 and Compensator. It sports a Worm Naval finish.Multiplayer  The QBU-88 is an unlockable DMR for all kits. It has the highest velocity and least recoil of all DMRs, after the SKS, as well as excelling in rate of fire and accuracy. Along with the RFB, it is more accurate on the move than other DMRs, as it is a bullpup weapon. These factors combine to make it very easy to land multiple shots quickly. However, it also has the lowest capacity in its class, making frequent reloads necessary. It also has below-average damage, the same as the SKS. While it will generally kill an enemy in three hits, enemies outside of close range with Defensive Upgrade Path equipped will require an additional hit to take down. Compared to other DMRs, it sacrifices magazine capacity and raw power for greater accuracy and stability. After the Fall patch, its velocity has been increased to 670 m/s, making the QBU-88 more viable as a long-range weapon, though the QBU-88 is limited to low-power scopes as with all DMRs.Trivia General Battlefield 2: Modern Combat Battlefield 3 Battlefield 4 External links SCAR-L  The SOF Combat Assault Rifle-Light, or SCAR-L, is a modular assault rifle made by Belgian small arms company Fabrique Nationale d'Herstal (FN Herstal). This is the light assault rifle variant of the SCAR weapon system, differing from the SCAR-H in that it uses the smaller caliber 5.56x45 NATO round instead of the Heavy variant's 7.62x51mm NATO round. It uses the NATO standard 30 round STANAG magazines and a number of barrel length variants are available in both calibers.Battlefield 2  The SCAR-L is a weapon featured in Battlefield 2 as a Tier Two unlock for the Special Forces Kit. It has marginally more spread than the G36C, as well as a prone modifier of 1.1, making it the only carbine whose minimum spread is unattainable under normal conditions; further, its visual recoil is identical to the M4's. It is marginally more powerful than the G36C and M4, but comes equipped with an optic like the latter carbine.Battlefield: Bad Company  The SCAR is a weapon featured in Battlefield: Bad Company.Singleplayer  The SCAR appears as a collectible. It can be found on Welcome to Bad Company, and Acta Non Verba, outside one of the factories while the player is destroying the Russian fuel reserves at the beginning of the level.Multiplayer  The SCAR is the default Compact Assault Rifle for the American Specialist kit. It has low damage and low rate of fire, compared to other Specialist weapons, making kills difficult to achieve. However, compared to other compact assault rifles, it does have good accuracy. It has a 60 round magazine and cannot use iron sights, as aiming simply does a slight zoom and increases accuracy (like all compact assault rifles in game).Battlefield: Bad Company 2  The SCAR-L Carbine is a weapon featured in Battlefield: Bad Company 2.Singleplayer  The SCAR-L is one of the two compact assault rifles found in the campaign, with the other being the AKS-74u. It can be found as a collectible in the level Crack the Sky and Zero Dark Thirty. It can also be found with a 4X Rifle Scope in Crack the Sky.Multiplayer  The SCAR-L Carbine is the second compact carbine issued to the Engineer Kit, requiring 2,510 experience points to unlock. It has low to medium recoil, a low rate of fire and high damage. Compared to some of the other Submachine Guns, it can be very effective at longer ranges. It can be used similarly to an Assault Rifle, and its low rate of fire prevents overwhelming recoil. Like the other weapons issued to the Engineer Kit, it is fitted with a suppressor. It has very similar stats to the starting\u00a0Engineer weapon, the 9A-91 Avtomat. The SCAR-L has 10 more rounds and more open iron sights, at the cost of sharper recoil and slightly more spread.Battlefield Play4Free  The SCAR-L is a weapon featured in Battlefield Play4Free as a purchasable weapon for the Assault Kit. It features medium damage, high accuracy and range, high recoil, and a fast fire rate. It costs 1469  or 90,000  to last forever and is unlocked at level 6. Despite being able to be fired fully automatic, this weapon is best used when fired in short bursts at long range because of its higher recoil. Like most other assault rifles, this weapon sports a black paint scheme.Battlefield 3  The SCAR-L is a weapon introduced in the Battlefield 3: Close Quarters expansion and is unlocked upon the completion of the Set Us Up The Bomb assignment. It was first seen in the killfeed during the Battlefield 3: Close Quarters Gameplay Premiere Trailer, although it was misspelled as SCARL-L. The gun itself is seen for the first time in a player's hands in the Donya Fortress Gameplay Trailer. The SCAR-L performs much like any other assault rifle in its class, and deviates from its carbine counterpart both in statistics and aesthetics. The SCAR-H has the upper-hand in damage, but the SCAR-L compensates with less damage drop-off at range and a larger magazine. Furthermore, while the SCAR-H has very potent recoil, the SCAR-L has almost none (although it does have a highly unusual 2.75 1st shot multiplier, making accurate short bursts difficult at longer ranges). Some visual differences to the heavy variant include a more grayish color and duct tape wrapped around the stock. It is available to the Assault Class, and is capable of mounting underslung weapons such as the M320 or the M26. The SCAR-L is the only assault rifle capable of mounting a Ballistic Scope. It should also be noted that the SCAR-L also has the unique advantage of\u00a0having\u00a0one full extra magazine over other assault rifles, meaning that the player has more ammo before running out. Out of all the available assault rifles and carbines featured in the game, it has the most ammunition. One big disadvantage that SCAR-L user may notice is its very low rate of fire of 620 RPM, which make it difficult to outgun the weapon with higher rate of fire. However the SCAR-L has mild kick and good accuracy over long bursts, making it suitable for mid-range engagement, where fast-firing weapon may find trouble to land accurate shots. The release of Battlefield 3: End Game introduced the SCAR-L Specialist assignment which unlocks the Desert Stripe and Digital Woodland camouflages upon completion.Trivia Bad Company 2 Battlefield 3 L96A1  The Arctic Warfare rifle, designated L118A1\u00a0by the British military,\u00a0is a\u00a0bolt-action, 7.62\u00d751mm NATO Sniper Rifle\u00a0created by the British company Accuracy International and fielded by several militaries worldwide. It derives from the Precision Marksman, which was designated as the L96A1\u00a0in British service. The rifle is so named due to being designed with features to improve performance in cold weather conditions, while not impairing its abilities in normal environments. The AW rifle has several derivatives, including the AWM magnum variant and the AWS suppressed variant. The AWM in particular is designated the\u00a0L115A3\u00a0and is the standard sniper rifle of the British Army, replacing the previous L118A1 and L96A1.\u00a0Battlefield 2  The\u00a0L96A1\u00a0is a weapon featured in the Battlefield 2: Euro Force expansion and is the default sniper rifle for the\u00a0European Union. Its spread values are identical to, with the exception of the\u00a0M24, rifles of the same class, with a zoomed spread of 0.05 and spread increase of 3.5 per round. The weapon's rate of fire, damage, and magazine size are identical to the M24 and is always capable of killing in two direct hits, at a maximum, with a minimum of one headshot for an instant kill.Battlefield Play4Free  The L96A1\u00a0is a weapon featured in\u00a0Battlefield Play4Free and is available for purchase at level 24. It features a large magazine, medium damage, fast reload and the highest rate of fire amongst bolt-action sniper rifles, with a very fast bolt cycle.Battlefield 3  The\u00a0L96 is a weapon introduced in the Battlefield 3: Back to Karkand expansion and is unlocked upon the completion of the Creeping Death assignment. It was first seen in the Strike at Karkand Gameplay Trailer. Compared to the\u00a0SV98\u00a0the L96's rounds have a higher velocity which causes bullets to drop less over longer ranges\u00a0giving it a similar drop pattern to the\u00a0JNG-90. The L96 also has the third fastest velocity out of all bolt action sniper rifles at 540 meters per second. Despite only minor differences, the JNG-90 is considered superior because it has a slightly higher velocity at 560 m/s, slightly slower reload at 2.5 seconds and a slightly higher rate of fire of 46.2 rounds per minute.Patch history  The L96 was originally the only bolt-action sniper rifle that could mount a\u00a0Flash Suppressor. When the Flash Suppressor was equipped onto the L96, the accuracy of the weapon, aimed or otherwise, was not affected at all whereas other weapons with a flash suppressor did suffer an accuracy loss. After the 3/27/12 patch, however, the flash suppressor no longer reduces aimed accuracy on any weapon. An update changed the damage and chest multiplier to 1.25 for the L96. With 80 damage at close range it will kill in one shot to the chest or at any range in hardcore. Before the June 4th 2012 patch, the point of aim on the L96 was vertically offset (with the possible exception of some rifle scopes) due to a bug. This caused shots to be fired from a point above the center of the sight the player was using, throwing off skewing aim. The iron sights are now aligned with the top of the post but\u00a0not with the dot on the post.Battlefield 4  The L96A1 was introduced in the Battlefield 4: China Rising expansion. It was later renamed to the L115, however, with the release of the Night Operations expansion to acknowledge that the weapon was modeled after the AWM instead of the similar L96A1. The AWM featured in Battlefield Hardline uses the same model as the L115 in Battlefield 4, which caused further reason to rename the weapon.Trivia General Battlefield 3 Battlefield 4 External links UMP  The UMP (German: Universale Maschinenpistole, English: Universal Submachine Gun) is a submachine gun developed and manufactured by Heckler & Koch used in the Battlefield series. The UMP is a blowback-operated, magazine-fed submachine gun firing from a closed bolt. As originally designed, the UMP is chambered for larger cartridges than other submachine guns like the MP5, to provide more stopping power against unarmored targets (with a slightly lower effective range) than the 9x19mm MP5 provides. A larger cartridge produces more recoil, and makes control more difficult in fully automatic firing. To mitigate this, the cyclic rate of fire was reduced 600 rounds/min for the UMP-45, which makes it one of the slower firing submachine guns on the market. There's also a version chambered for the rather standard 9x19mm Parabellum, known as the UMP-9.Battlefield 2: Modern Combat  The UMP .45 is featured in Battlefield 2: Modern Combat as the main weapon of the EU Spec Ops kit. It has decent accuracy, a high fire rate, and moderate damage.Battlefield: Bad Company  The UMP is a weapon featured in Battlefield: Bad Company, issued to the Specialist kit as an unlockable costing one unlock credit. It has 60-round magazine and 180 rounds in reserve, as with all Specialist-exclusive weapons. It has a has a moderate rate of fire, high damage and mediocre accuracy, however, compared to the other compact assault rifles in the game, it has the lowest rate of fire, the highest damage per bullet and the highest accuracy. There is a UMP Trophy and is unlocked by achieving 6 kills with the UMP in one game. This trophy when awarded, is usually accompanied by the \"Compact Assault Rifle Efficiency\" Trophy.Battlefield: Bad Company 2  The UMP-45 is a weapon featured in Battlefield: Bad Company 2 as the 7th and last submachine gun issued to the Engineer kit requiring 43000 experience points to unlock. It has a 25-round magazine, low recoil, decent damage and good accuracy. Compared to the other SMGs, it has higher power and higher accuracy, which is advantageous at longer ranges, but its lower rate of fire is a nuisance in close quarters. It can use a Red dot sight and 4X Rifle Scope. While the weapon does have arguably obstructive iron sights, the lack of recoil and muzzle flash can reduce the need for a red dot sight at close range. It has exactly the same damage and rate of fire as the SCAR-L Carbine, but trades 5 rounds for less recoil and tighter spread. Players may face a dilemma when choosing the better submachine gun of the two.UMP-45 SA  The UMP-45 SA is also available to those who purchased the SPECACT DLC on Xbox at 160 Microsoft Points or PS3 at $1.99. It is the UMP-45 customized with either Desert, Woodland, or Arctic camouflage depending on what environment the player is in. The SPECACT DLC has been released as downloadable content for the PC on 1 December via the EA Store and on Steam.Battlefield Play4Free  The UMP-45 is a weapon featured in Battlefield Play4Free as a purchasable submachine gun for the Engineer kit. When using the UMP45 features lower-than-average recoil, moderate damage, moderate deviation and above average range. The UMP45 performs in similar regard to the PDW-R, but differs in that it has a more even damage spread over range. The weapon also features lower recoil that most SMGs, allowing it to stay on targets even at medium ranges.Battlefield 3  The UMP45 is a weapon featured in Battlefield 3.Singleplayer  The PLR forces use the UMP-45 without accessories. Several PLR insurgents are seen using it on the first section of the first mission Semper Fidelis, but due to gameplay reasons, they cannot be picked-up on the said section. They can only be picked up starting in the third mission, Uprising, wherein it reappears as a weapon of the PLR. It also appears in Operation Guillotine in the hands of nameless USMC soldiers. Misfit 1-3 is randomly generated with them in Fear No Evil. Lastly, as in the flashback mission, the UMP-45 can be picked up in the last mission, The Great Destroyer.Co-Op  During the Co-op campaign it is found in Hit and Run without accessories. It can also be found on National Police and some PLR in Drop 'Em Like Liquid.Multiplayer  The UMP-45 is unlocked at Rank 16 and is classified as a PDW (Personal Defense Weapon). It has a 25+1 capacity and a moderate rate of fire, recoil and very high stopping power compared to the other PDW's, capable of taking an enemy down within 3-8 shots, even in medium range. The UMP-45, P90, and PP-19 are the only PDW's that do not unlock the Extended Magazine attachment, but instead gains the Flash Suppressor. Battlefield Premium members have access to the Navy Blue Digital camouflage for the UMP-45 or the Berkut camo if they have completed the UMP-45 Specialist assignment.Battlefield 3: Aftershock  The UMP-45 appears as one of four selectable primary weapons in Battlefield 3: Aftershock. The gun holds 25 round per magazine and the total ammo count for the gun is 150 rounds.Battlefield 4  Two variants of the UMP appear in Battlefield 4. The two weapons function fairly similarly, and are both Engineer-exclusive personal defense weapons. Due to caliber sizes, the primary differences between the two are that the UMP-45 both hits and kicks harder, while the UMP-9 possesses a slightly larger magazine and better handling characteristics. The UMP-45 also makes an appearance in both the single and multiplayer aspects of Battlefield 4, whereas the UMP-9 only appears in multiplayer.UMP-45  The UMP-45 appears in Battlefield 4 as a Personal Defense Weapon.Singleplayer  The UMP-45 is used by Tombstone in the mission Shanghai. Afterwards, it can be equipped at any Weapon Crate. It's equipped with a Reflex, Heavy Barrel and Angled Grip. It has no camouflage equipped.Multiplayer  The UMP-45 is the second PDW unlocked for the Engineer Kit. It remains a powerful weapon at close range, and also has good damage across range while maintaining controllable recoil, with a moderate vertical muzzle climb. Before the Fall patch, its low velocity of 320 m/s is worsened to 180 m/s with a Suppressor, reducing its effectiveness at range, as the player will have to lead the target to compensate it. After the Fall patch, its suppressed velocity has been increased from 180 m/s to 270 m/s, reducing velocity compensation required to hit the opponent. Its side-to-side recoil is also tied to UMP-9.UMP-9  The UMP-9 is a PDW featured in Battlefield 4. It is unlocked upon the completion of the Engineer Expert gold tier assignment. It is slightly different than the UMP-45, with a curved magazine and a higher fire rate. It shares the same reload animation as UMP-45. When compared to the UMP-45, the UMP-9 features a fire rate increase of 100 rpm, 5 more rounds in a magazine, a higher bullet velocity, and less recoil, but at the cost of reduced damage per shot, due to the UMP-9 being chambered with 9x19mm Parabellum, which lacks the stopping power of the .45 ACP.Battlefield Hardline  Like in Battlefield 4, two variants of the UMP appear in Battlefield Hardline: the UMP-45 and the UMP-9 introduced with Getaway. Like their counterparts, the primary differences between the two are damage, recoil, and magazine capacity, as they both handle similarly and are exclusive to the Mechanic kit. The UMP-45 also appears in singleplayer, while the UMP-9 is multiplayer exclusive.UMP-45  The UMP-45 is a weapon featured in Battlefield Hardline. It is an available Submachine gun for the Criminal Mechanic kit and comes equipped with a Holo sight and Laser sight. The UMP does more damage than the other weapons available to Mechanic, but has a smaller magazine capacity, a slower fire rate, and more recoil than most of the other sub-machine guns.UMP-9  The UMP-9 is a weapon set to be included in the Battlefield Hardline: Getaway expansion, exclusive to the Mechanic kit.Trivia Bad Company series Battlefield 3 Battlefield 4 Battlefield Hardline External links ", "Super Smash Bros.

Benched Smasher: Smashers that can't attack but can't directly be attacked by most attacks. You can only have up to 5 Smashers on your Bench. Stage cards: Where Stage cards are played. The effects of Stage cards usually apply to all players in a match. Discard Pile: Where discarded cards are sent to. Discarded cards can't be used and aren't considered to be in play, but discarded cards can be brought back using certain effects from another card. Prize Cards: This is where Prize cards should be layed out during a standard match or a match type that uses Prize cards. Prize cards should always be facing down.Different Types of Cards  Below are a variety of different types of cards you can use to your advantage.Turn Order  At the beginning of any game, each player draws 7 cards from the top of their deck. If a player has at least 1 Basic Smasher, that player must play that Smasher as their Active Smasher faced down. If you have any more Basic Smashers in your hand, you may play them on your Bench faced down. If you do not have any Basic Smashers in your hand, show your hand to your opponent (this is called a Mulligan). Then you can shuffle your hand into your deck and draw another 7 cards. Repeat the process until you have a Basic Smasher. After both players have played Basic Smashers, if both players are playing with Prize cards, each player puts the top 6 cards from their deck faced down as Prize cards. If neither player has had any Mulligans or have the same number of Mulligans, both players must decide who goes first by flipping a coin. The player who guesses the outcome of the coin flip correctly gets to go first. You can also use a 6-sided die to determine the turn order instead, even numbers are treated as heads, while odd numbers are treated as tails. If a player has more Mulligans than their opponent, their opponent gets to go first instead. This is when both players can turn their Smashers in play face up. Below is the list of actions in order you take during your turn: Any effects that require you to flip a coin can instead be done with a 6-sided die. Even numbers are treated as heads while odd numbers are treated as tails After you've attacked with your Active Smasher, your turn is over and your opponent begins their turn.

Click here to go to Crimson Castle Forum's F.A.Q. topic where you can ask various questions about the rules and cards used in Super Smash Bros. Battle Cards.Same-Type Mutation  Same-Type Mutation is an alternative game type used in Super Smash Bros. Battle Cards. In this game type, a Basic Smasher can evolve into any Stage 1 Smashers that are the same type as the Basic Smasher. The same applies when evolving into Stage 2 Smashers. Evolution in this game type allows you to ignore the character specific type when evolving, as well as putting FS cards onto Smashers. (If a Smasher FS is of a Stage 2 Smasher, it still can only be put on top of a Stage 2 Smasher.) The only rule the players must follow when evolving Smasher, is that the evolved Smasher card must be the same Energy-type as the Smasher that card is being played on top of. For Evolved Smashers with multiple Energy-types, the previous Smasher's Energy-type only has to match 1 of the Evolved Smasher's Energy-types in order to evolve into that Smasher. The Smasher can still evolve into Smashers of different Energy-types if they could still normally evolve into that Smasher. This game type is compatible with any other of the game types used in Super Smash Bros. Battle Cards.Differences to Pok\u00e9mon TCG  The purpose of this article is to help confident Pok\u00e9mon TCG players ease into Super Smash Bros. Battle Cards quicker, by listing the key differences between Pok\u00e9mon TCG and Smash Cards (most changes to names and terms are not included).Pok\u00e9mon TCG logo.png Elemental Types  Elemental types play a large role in Smash cards. Much like in the Pok\u00e9mon TCG, both Smashers and Energy cards can be one or more of those types. For Smashers, the Elemental type determines what Smashers they are stronger or weaker against, depending on their Weakness and Resistance. If a Smasher is weak to a certain element, if they take damage from an attack performed by a Smasher of that type, they take more damage. While if a Smasher is resistant to a certain element, if they take damage from an attack performed by a Smasher of that type, they takes less damage. The Elemental type of attacks is determined by the Smasher's type, not the type of Energy used to perform the attack. Currently there are 12 different types in Super Smash Bros. Battle Cards. 9 of them from Pok\u00e9mon TCG (In Smash Cards, Lightning is renamed to Electric and Darkness is referred to simply as Dark), and 3 new types unique to Smash Cards called the Smash-type (based on Pok\u00e9mon TCG's Colorless-type), Star-type and Subspace-type. Below you can read more about the individual types.Smash  Smash-type can be considered a neutral type, since any type of Energy cards can be used to fulfill the requirements of  attack costs. Because of this most  Smashers can be easier to play but end up having weaker attacks. While no other type of Smashers are weak to  Smashers, they make it up by having no Weakness (or if they do have a Weakness, they usually get higher HP or a Resistance). While Smash-type does not have its own Basic Energy card, it does however have multiple Special Energy cards that provide a variety of effects. Generally,  Smashers have a Weakness to: Generally,  Smashers have a Resistance to:Fighting  Fighting-type Smashers are common Smashers that often specialize in dishing out raw damage, and rarely rely on special effects or conditions. Fighting-type has its own Basic Energy card, as well as a Special Energy card that increases the amount of damage the  Smasher deals by 10. Generally,  Smashers have a Weakness to: Generally,  Smashers have a Resistance to:Grass  Grass-type Smashers often specialize in inflicting a variety of Special Conditions and healing. Grass-type has its own Basic Energy card, as well as a Special Energy card that gives  Smashers a chance to inflict the Poisoned Special Condition on their opponent while attacking. Generally,  Smashers have a Weakness to: Generally,  Smashers have a Resistance to:Fire  Fire-type Smashers are common Smashers that often specialize in inflicting the Special Condition Burned and performing powerful attacks that often require Energy cards to be discarded. Fire-type has its own Basic Energy card, as well as a Special Energy card that gives  Smashers a chance to inflict the Burned Special Condition on their opponent while attacking. Generally,  Smashers have a Weakness to: Generally,  Smashers have no Resistance.Water  Water-type Smashers often specialize in obtaining Energy cards, and using attacks that grow stronger the more Energy cards they have. Water-type has its own Basic Energy card, as well as a Special Energy card that gives  Smashers protection from all Special Conditions. Generally,  Smashers have a Weakness to: Generally,  Smashers have a Resistance to:Electric  Electric-type Smashers often specialize in the Special Condition Stunned, as well as abilities that protect them from attacks or prevent their opponent from attacking or using abilities. Electric-type has its own Basic Energy card, as well as a Special Energy card that gives  Smashers a small chance to inflict the Stunned Special Condition on their opponent while attacking. Generally,  Smashers have a Weakness to: Generally,  Smashers have a Resistance to:Metal  Metal-type Smashers often specialize in the protective abilities to keep themselves alive longer, some  Smashers may also have resistances to certain Special Conditions. Metal-type has its own Basic Energy card, as well as a Special Energy card that reduces any damage done to  Smashers by 10. Generally,  Smashers have a Weakness to: Generally,  Smashers have a Resistance to:Psychic  Psychic-type Smashers are rare Smashers that often specialize in the Special Condition Confused, as well as using attacks based around Energy cards or using abilities that can manipulate Energy cards. Psychic-type has its own Basic Energy card, as well as a Special Energy card that gives  Smashers a chance to inflict the Confused Special Condition on their opponent while attacking. Generally,  Smashers have a Weakness to: Generally,  Smashers have a Resistance to:Dark  Dark-type Smashers are common Smashers that often specialize in abilities that hinder your opponent in a variety of ways, some  Smashers also specialize in powerful attacks. Dark-type has its own Basic Energy card, as well as a Special Energy card that gives  Smashers a chance to inflict the Asleep Special Condition on their opponent while attacking. Generally,  Smashers have a Weakness to: Generally,  Smashers have a Resistance to:Star  Star-type Smashers often specialize in protective abilities to keep themselves alive longer, as well as some healing abilities. Star-type has its own Basic Energy card, as well as a Special Energy card that heals  Smashers of a little amount of damage whenever they attack. Generally,  Smashers have a Weakness to: Generally,  Smashers have a Resistance to:Dragon  Dragon-type Smashers often specialize in discarding your opponent's cards, or launching powerful attacks with a self-inflicted negative effect. Dragon-type has its own Basic Energy card, as well as a Special Energy card that lets  Smashers discard cards from their opponent's deck whenever they attack. Generally,  Smashers have a Weakness to: Generally,  Smashers have a Resistance to:Subspace  Subspace-type Smashers are a unique bunch of Smashers from the Subspace Emissary set. With the exception of Tabuu, all  Smashers are dual-typed Smashers. They are a tad stronger than other Smashers of a similar level, but when they get Knocked Out, they get sent to the Subspace Zone where they can't come back. (All other cards attached to them get discarded.)  Smashers are among the few Smashers with attacks and abilities that can send your opponent's cards or even your own to the Subspace Zone. While Subspace-type does not have its own Basic Energy card, it does have a Special Energy card that, when attached to a  Smasher, will provide every type of Energy for that Smasher (but only 1 at a time). Generally,  Smashers have a Weakness to: Generally,  Smashers don't have a common Resistance, but depending on their secondary type, they may get any kind of Resistance related to their secondary typing.Smasher Cards  Smasher cards are the main force you use to fight your opponent with. Smasher cards come in a large variety and can all have their own unique abilities. There are 5 different kinds of Smashers; Basic Smashers, Evolved Smashers, Smasher Ex, Smasher FS, and Smasher SP.Basic Smashers  Basic Smashers can be played straight from your hand and do not need to played over on top of other cards. This makes Basic Smashers the easiest kinds of Smashers to play but are generally the weakest. Name: Name of the card. Stage: Displays the level of evolution. Smasher Type: The Energy type assigned to the Smasher. This determines what types of Smasher this Smasher's attacks will be strong and weak against. Hit Points: How much damage this Smasher can take before they are Knocked Out. Smash Power/Body: Displays the effect of a Smash Power/Body. Most Smash Powers can be activated at any time (even while that Smasher is on your Bench), but some have restrictions on when they can be activated. A Smasher can also use a Smash Power and attack on the same turn. Smash Bodies are passive effect that are either always active or are triggered by an effect. Attack Cost: Shows the Energy types required to be attached to the Smasher in order to use the attack. Any type of Energy cards can be used to fulfill the requirements of  symbols. Attacks with a  do not need any Energy in order to perform the attack. (That type of symbol is usually only found on attacks from Support cards.) Attack Text: Displays any effects of the attack. Attack Damage: Shows how much damage the attack deals. (Sometimes the damage number will be in the Attack Text.) Every 10 damage is equal to 1 damage counter. Weakness: Displays the Energy type of Smashers that this Smasher will take extra damage from. Resistance: Displays the Energy type of Smashers that this Smasher will take less damage from. Retreat Cost: Displays how much Energy attached to this Smasher is needed to be discarded in order to retreat that Smasher back to your Bench. Only the Active Smasher can retreat. Set Symbol: Displays the symbol of the set this card belongs to. Rarity Symbol: Determines how rare the card is. Collector Card Number: Shows what number the card is in its set. This makes it easier to identify specific cards in a set that can have cards with the same name.Evolved Smashers  Evolved Smashers are stronger Smashers with more HP and have stronger attacks. However, they require another Smasher to be in play to be put on top of that Smasher. So if you don't have the right Smasher card in play, you can't play that Evolved Smasher. This makes them more difficult to play compared to Basic Smashers. This is a Stage 1 Smasher that you put on top of one of your Basic Smashers. Under the name of the Smasher is the details about which card this Smasher can be put on top of. For example, Giant Donkey Kong may only be put on top of a Smasher with the name Donkey Kong. (The picture in the top left of the card helps identify this Smasher.) When you evolve a Smasher, all cards attached to the previous Smasher stay on the new Evolved Smasher. All damage counters on the previous Smasher are put onto the Evolved Smasher. However, all Special Conditions that the previous Smasher was affected by are not put onto the Evolved Smasher, curing that Smasher of those Conditions. This includes additional effects that the previous Smasher was affected by. You can also evolve a Stage 1 Smasher into a Stage 2 Smasher. Which are even stronger than Stage 1 Smashers but are more difficult to play because they have the same rules of playing them as Stage 1 Smashers do.Smasher Ex  Ex Smashers are far more powerful than your average Smashers, containing more HP and stronger attacks. Below is an example of an Ex Smasher. Compared to other Smashers, Master Hand has very high HP, his attack can target any of your opponent's Smashers, and Creator allows you search for any Smasher (excluding Ex and FS Smashers) in your deck to send to your hand. However, Ex Smashers do have their disadvantages. If your opponent manages to Knock Out any of your Ex Smashers, they get a take 2 Prize cards instead of 1 (or draw 2 cards in non-Prize matches). You can also only have 1 copy of each Ex Smasher, which counts to the same name total as their non-Ex variants (e.g you can have 3 Mario and 1 Mario Ex but not 4 Mario and 1 Mario Ex).Smasher FS  FS Smashers contain unique abilities and attacks that can be far stronger than ordinary attacks, even stronger than an Ex Smasher's attack. Below is what an FS Smasher looks like. Another advantage is that FS Smashers can use any Smash Powers, Smash Bodies and attacks from their previous level, which can give them extra diversity. However, much like the Ex Smashers, you can only have 1 copy of each FS Smasher in your deck, and it also counts to the same name total as their non-FS variants (e.g you can have 3 Mario and 1 Mario FS but not 4 Mario and 1 Mario FS). Another disadvantage is that you can only play them on top of your Active Smasher and not your Benched Smashers, further limiting how they can be played. Also in addition to inheriting the previous level's Smash Powers, Smash Bodies and attacks, FS Smashers will also inherit the previous level's Prize count. In other words, FS Smashers played on top of normal Smashers will still only give away 1 Prize card, but FS Smashers played on top of Ex Smashers will give away 2 Prize cards when Knocked Out, so they extra consideration for which Smashers you want to play your FS card on top of! Much like Evolved Smashers, you can't play any FS Smasher cards during your first turn. However, unlike Evolved Smashers, you can still play an FS Smasher card on top of a Smasher you have just played or evolved. But despite sharing similar mechanics, an FS Smasher is not considered an Evolved Smasher unless if their previous level was an Evolved Smasher.Smasher SP  SP Smashers are personalized Smashers owned by another character. Below is an example of an SP Smasher. The Smasher above is a Charizard owned by Red (who uses the  symbol). Each owner has their own portrait and symbol. What's special about SP Smashers is they're their own class of Smashers, and their owner's symbol makes them unique. For example, Charizard  is classed as a completely different Smasher to a normal Charizard, meaning you could have up to 4 Charizards and 4 Charizard  in your deck. However, cards that would normally work on their normal variants may not work on them. A Charizard FS card can't played on top of a Charizard  card unless if it was a Charizard  FS... Which we have below as an example of a SP FS Smasher. Likewise, a Charizard  FS card can't be played on top of a normal Charizard card.Pok\u00e9mon TCG  Players battle each other using a deck of 60 cards. Players had 3 different types of cards to use, Pok\u00e9mon cards (the cards players use to battle with), Energy cards (used to power up Pok\u00e9mon so they can attack) and Trainer cards (supportive cards that can benefit the user in various ways). Later on Supporter cards and Stadium cards were separated from Trainer cards. A deck always had to have at least 1 Basic Pok\u00e9mon and can only have up to 4 copies of each card in their deck (but were allowed to have any number of Basic Energy cards). There a large variety of different types of Pok\u00e9mon. Each Pok\u00e9mon has an elemental type that makes it stronger or weaker against certain elemental types. There are also Evolved Pok\u00e9mon, which unlike Basic Pok\u00e9mon, can only be put into play ontop of the required Pok\u00e9mon. The main objective to winning in a Pok\u00e9mon TCG battle is to take all of your Prize cards by Knocking Out the opponent's Pok\u00e9mon before they take all of their Prize cards. Taking all of your Prize cards is not the only way to win, players can also win if their opponent has no Benched Pok\u00e9mon to replace their Knocked Out Active Pok\u00e9mon or if their opponent has no cards left in their deck at the beginning of their turn. Many Pok\u00e9mon TCG card tournaments are held worldwide and are even set up and handled by Nintendo.External Links Special Conditions  Special Conditions are negative effects that aid in Knocking Out a Smasher or preventing them from attacking. Only Active Smashers can be affected by Special Conditions, and if an Active Smasher with any Special Conditions is sent back to the Bench, that Smasher is cured of any Special Conditions. Evolving or playing an FS card onto your Active Smasher also removes any Special Conditions on them. There are five Special Conditions total; Asleep, Confused, Stunned, Poisoned and Burned. Asleep, Confused and Stunned change the angle of your Smasher. Here is a picture to show what angles your card should be turned to when affected by a Special Conditions. Poisoned and Burned use markers similar to damage counters to show that a Smasher is affected by those Conditions. Because of how the Special Conditions work, a Smasher can't be Asleep and Stunned, Asleep and Confused or Stunned and Confused at the same time. However, a Smasher can still be Poisoned and Asleep at the same time and even Poisoned, Burned and Asleep at the same time. If a Smasher is Asleep, Stunned or Confused and is affected by a new Special Condition that is Asleep, Stunned or Confused, the new Special Condition overrides the old Special Condition. Now here's what each Special Condition does:Poisoned  Put a Poisoned marker on the Poisoned Smasher. Between each player's turns, 1 damage counter is put onto all Smashers that have a Poisoned marker on them. You can't have more than 1 Poisoned marker on a Smasher.Burned  Put a Burned marker on the Burned Smasher. Between each player's turns, flip a coin for each Smasher that has a Burned marker on them. If the outcome is tails, put 2 damage counters on that Smasher. You can't have more than 1 Burned marker on a Smasher.Asleep  Turn the Smasher that is Asleep counter-clockwise. Between each player's turns, flip a coin for each Smasher that is Asleep. If the outcome is heads, they are no longer Asleep and are turned back to their normal position. If the outcome is tails, that Smasher is still Asleep. Smashers who are Asleep can't attack or retreat.Confused  Turn the Smasher that is Confused upside down. When a Confused Smasher attempts to attack, the player flips a coin. If the outcome is tails, that Smasher's attack fails and 2 damage counters are put onto that Smasher (the player does not perform any requirements from the attack such as discarding cards or taking extra recoil damage). The player also has to a flip a coin if they want to retreat a Confused Smasher. If the outcome is tails, that retreat fails, but the player does not put any damage counters on the Confused Smasher for failing to retreat. When a Confused Smasher attempts to retreat, you flip the coin before paying for the retreat cost.Stunned  Turn the Stunned Smasher clockwise. A Stunned Smasher can't attack or retreat. However, at the end of their player's turn, that Stunned Smasher is no longer Stunned.List of Starter Decks  This is a list of all starter decks made for Super Smash Bros. Battle Cards.Mutation  Mutation is an alternative game type used in Super Smash Bros. Battle Cards. In this game type, a Basic Smasher can evolve into any Stage 1 Smashers, which can also evolve into any Stage 2 Smashers. Evolution in this game type allows you to ignore the character specific type when evolving, as well as putting FS cards onto Smashers. (If a Smasher FS is of a Stage 2 Smasher, it still can only be put on top of a Stage 2 Smasher.) This game type is compatible with any other of the game types used in Super Smash Bros. Battle Cards.LackeyCCG  LackeyCCG is a computer program that can be used to play any type of card game against online opponents, and can also be used to test decks offline with a player controllable bot. The program was made by Trevor Agnitti for Windows and Mac (It has also been reported to work on Linux and Wine), it is currently in the beat testing stage. In LackeyCCG players can make their own card games by making a plugin for LackeyCCG, the plugin can then be distritubed to other users via the AutoUpdate feature, providing that the plugin files are uploaded onto the internet and people have a link address that they can use. Plugins for official card games (Such as Magic the Gathering and Pok\u00e9mon) have also been made by fans. To accommodate the needs of a variety of card games, LackeyCCG does not use a built-in rules engine, meaning that the players themselves are responsible for keeping track of their games. However, LackeyCCG does provide various functions to help keep track of various statistics such as counters and tools for creating zones, turns and phases.External Links Team Battle Match  Team Battle Match is an alternative game type used in Super Smash Bros. Battle Cards, where more than 2 players can participate in (an even number of players is more preferable). A Team Battle Match is the same as a Standard Battle and is even compatible with many other rule types. All players still get 1 Active Smasher and between 2-5 Benched Smashers (this can be decided between the players). All players may choose to divide the number of Prize cards each team needs to take between the players, or all players can have 6 Prize cards to take. (Either way, all players may only take their own Prize cards and not their teammate's.) If a player is able to take a Prize card but has none left, while their teammates have any Prize cards left, that player may allow one of their teammates to take their Prize card. If a player has no Smashers left in play at the end of their turn, but their teammates still have Smashers in play, that player is not automatically removed from the battle. If a player has no cards left to draw from their deck at the beginning of their turn, they are still removed from the battle regardless of how many cards their teammates have left in their decks. Whenever a player is removed from battle, their teammates must take the bottom cards from their deck and add them as Prize cards for each Prize card the removed player had left. You're only allowed to attack your designated opponent. Only after your designated opponent is defeated can you choose another designated opponent. Any effects that can affect multiple Smashers will only affect yours and your designated opponent's Smashers (Stage cards are the exception to this, also all players can still only have 1 Stage card in play). Any effects that happen between turns will only happen before and after the turn for the player that activated the effect (such as Stage cards), or before and after the turn for the players that are specifically affected by the effect that happens between turns (such as a Poisoned Smasher).Energyless  Energyless is an alternative game type used in Super Smash Bros. Battle Cards. Energyless is similar to the game type Free Attack, where all attacks on every Smasher have no attack cost. However, Energy cards can't be used in this game type (including Special Energy cards). This also means that any attacks that are dependent on any number of Energy cards can't be used.Free Attack  Free Attack is an alternative game type used in Super Smash Bros. Battle Cards. In this game type, both players ignore the attack costs for any attacks on their Smashers. This means that the player can use a Smasher's attack regardless of whether that Smasher has the required amount of Energy to perform that attack or not. There are a few exceptions to this:Super-smash-bros-n64-boxart.jpg Knock-Out Match  Knock-Out Match is an alternative game type used in Super Smash Bros. Battle Cards. The objective of this game type is to get enough points before your opponent by Knocking Out their Smashers (6 Points is the general number used). For each Prize card you would of drawn, you get a point (so you get 2 points if you Knock Out an Ex Smasher). Because this game type doesn't use Prize cards, whenever you Knock Out any of your opponent's Smashers, you draw a card from your deck (2 if you Knocked Out an Ex Smasher). There are various ways that allow you to win: It's possible to achieve multiple conditions at once. If both you and your opponent have reached the Knock Out total at the same time, and are drawing in points, check to see if any of the other conditions have happened. If both you and your opponent have reached the Knock Out total, but your opponent has no more Smashers left in play or has no cards left in their deck, then you win. If both both players have reached the Knock Out total at the same time, but one of the players has a higher Knock Out total, that player wins. If the match turns out to be a draw, a new match in Sudden Death can be played. The same rules for Standard Match apply for Sudden Death, expect both players only have to Knock Out 1 of their opponent's Smashers instead of the usual amount.Standard Match  Standard Match is the main game type used in Super Smash Bros. Battle Cards. All cards are compatible with this game type. The objective of the game is to take all of your Prize cards (this number can range from 1-6) before your opponent does. There are various ways that allow you to win: It's possible to achieve multiple conditions at once. If both you and your opponent have taken the last Prize card at the same time, check to see if any of the other conditions have happened. If both you and your opponent have taken the last Prize card, but your opponent has no more Smashers left in play or has no cards left in their deck, then you win. If the match turns out to be a draw, a new match in Sudden Death can be played. The same rules for Standard Match apply for Sudden Death, expect both players only play 1 Prize card instead of the usual amount.Support Cards  You can play a deck without Support cards, but Support cards provide useful effects that when used properly, can help give you an extra edge in battle. Below is what a Support card looks like. Name: Name of the card. Support Type: Important to know, as there are different types of Support cards that function differently. How to play the card: Different types of Support cards are played differently, some stay in play after using them, others get discarded upon use or if the Smasher it is attached to is Knocked Out, and only some Support cards can be attached to a Smasher. Effect: This describes what the card does. Despite the different varieties of Support cards, they all allow the same format as above. There are seven different kinds of Support cards; Item, Setting, Equipment, Stage, Assist, Accessory and Ability cards.Item cards  Item cards are discarded upon use, and their effects are automatically activated as soon as you play the card.Setting cards  Setting cards function the same way as Item cards do, in which they are discarded upon use, and their effects are automatically activated as soon as you play the card. However, Setting cards are considered in a different category compared to Item cards.Equipment cards  Equipment cards are Support cards that you can attach to 1 of your Smashers in play and can provide new attacks for that Smasher. The effect of the card applies to the Smasher it is attached to for as long as the card is attached to that Smasher. Each Smasher can only have up to 1 Equipment card attached to them. Equipment cards are discarded along with the Smasher and any other cards attached to that Smasher when that Smasher is Knocked Out.Stage cards  Stage cards are played straight onto the field. The Stage card's effects apply for both Players, and only one Stage card can be on the field at a time. As it says on the card above, when a new Stage card is played by either Player, as long as the new Stage card does not have the same name as the old Stage card, the old Stage card is discarded.Assist cards  While only 1 Assist card can be used during your turn, they provide stronger effects. Most Assist cards usually help with obtaining cards from your deck in various way. Some Assist cards may have attacks that you can even use with them instead of attacking with your Active Smasher (Attacking with Assist cards can help bypass some defensive effects that would otherwise effect your Active Smasher if they attacked instead).Accessory cards  Accessory cards are similar to Equipment cards but provide passive effects for the Smasher rather than new attacks. Unlike Equipment cards, you can only lose Accessory cards attached to your Smashers if they get Knocked Out.Ability cards  Ability cards are very similar to Equipment cards. Like Accessory cards, they are only lost when the Smasher the Ability card is attached to is Knocked Out. There is also no limits to how many Ability cards you can attach to a Smasher, but all Ability cards can only be attached to Smashers of certain names, limiting which Smashers you can use the Ability card with.Energy Cards  Energy cards are the cards that Smashers need in order to perform attacks. Energy cards can also increase the power of some attacks and abilities, as well as provide beneficial effects. There are two different types of Energy cards; Basic Energy cards and Special Energy cards.Basic Energy Cards  Basic Energy cards are the only cards that players are allowed to have more than 4 of. There's a Basic Energy card for each Elemental type (with the exception of Smash-type ). Any type of Basic Energy can be used to fulfill the requirements of  symbols in attack costs. Below is what a Basic Energy card looks like.Special Energy Cards  Special Energy cards are more powerful Energy cards that come with additional effects, and some may even provide more than 1 units of Energy. Unlike Basic Energy cards, you can only have 4 of each Special Energy cards in your deck. There are Special Energy cards all Smashers can use, as well as Elemental type or even Smasher type specific Energy cards that are best used for that type of Smasher.Community  This category may include pages and subcategories related to the active contributors to the site, as seen on Special:ListUsers.", "Battle Spirits Wiki": "Battle Spirits Wiki Battle Spirits Brave  Battle Spirits Brave (\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30b9\u30d4\u30ea\u30c3\u30c4 \u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30f4) is an anime inspired by Bandai's Battle Spirits trading card game, and produced by Sunrise.

She wears a blue and white dress which doesn't cover her shoulders. Its sleeves are pink. She has very long light purple socks. On one leg is a heart-shaped pouch. Her battle form is pink armor. She customized it with a blue tail and horns, and red wings. In the epilogue, Mai is seen wearing a standard Japanese school uniform. In Brave, her hair is grown long. She wears a dark-pink and white shirt and purple skirt covered by a white a pink jacket. She wears a green stone around her neck, which can actually open the portal to the future. She has long yellow socks.Personality  She dreams of stardom and wants to look cool. She's described as \"scary\" when she gets serious in battle. She can be rather stubborn and high-maintenance, but is a generally nice person. In Brave, she's become much more gentle and feminine. She worries about Dan a lot.Biography Gekiha Dan  Mai was first seen searching for Kousuke, an opponent she has once faced in a Battle Spirits tournament. Kousuke soon reveals himself, and Mai defeats him. Afterwards, she joins Dan 's group and gives everyone a ride in the Violet. They soon encounter a gate, which can't be opened. Dan suggested using the Violet to ram the gate, but Mai wasn't a big fan of that idea. The gatekeeper, Mira, only agreed to let them in after being defeated in a duel. Clackey rises to the challenge and wins. The group was allowed to pass. They soon led a mission to destroy the horizon ladder. Mai wanted to leave the group but Serge convinced her by saying that there could be a movie based on this starring, of course, her. Inspired, Mai delivers a flying kick that landed on Kazan 's chin. Everyone started fighting the soldiers, until the otherworlders (who were being forced to build the ladder) are freed. The mission was a success, and they left. Mai then decided to kick out Dan and the others. As she was about to leave, though, Clackey reveals he has the ship's key. Clackey duels Mai and since he lost, he returns the key. Mai went to the blue world to watch the tournament, and was able to talk to Yuuki and Kajitsu, Once in the final match, Kajitsu was experiencing pain and in an attempt to help her brings her to Magisa . She enlisted Suzuri to help her by lying to him and telling to him that she'll give him an X-rare. Dan and Brustom battle after the tournament, but Dan lost so he has to serve as Yuuki's servant. Mai reunites with the others with Kajitsu in tow. Since Suzuri was made into the blue king, he did not join Mai and the others in leaving the blue world. Mai faced Leon in a duel, but she lost. Leon wanted to take Kajitsu back, but Clackey (who has doubts about protecting Kajitsu) challenged Leon, and he won.Leon and the others retreated. Leon then burned the forest down in a desperate attempt to draw out Kajitsu, forcing our heroes to escape. They made a stop at the yellow world, where they met with Kotarou, a young Pentan duelist.Zungurii duels Kotarou, and Zungurii wins. Mai wasn't to happy during the duel (neither was anyone else for that matter) because as Zungurii loses a life each one of them is forced to wear a pentan costume. When Dan is brought back, everyone was happy, but they soon realized something was wrong with him. It turns out his core was damaged in a battle with Otherworld King. Leon's forces started chasing them again, so Mai separates from the group to stall them. She faces Pantera and lost. She then fell to unconsciousness, and was rescued by Namii. Namii then placed her in prison. Mai recognized her, but Namii was angry because Mai took her best card. Despite Namii's obvious hatred of Mai, she still treated her good enough. Mai was overjoyed to see Dan dueling again, and she was witness to Dan's fight against Gouda and the tag battle against Brustom and Heliostom. Namii then decided to settle their feud in a duel. Namii was angry, because in the past, she and Mai dueled, and since Namii lost, she gave away her The SevenShogun Beelzebeat , the Violet, and Serge, her servant. Both players used purple decks, and the fight was intense. Ryoko decided to give them both a copy of The SevenShogun Asmodios , a new X-rare, and the winner will get to keep the card. Although both players were able to summon it, Mai won the duel. She then left the prison with Dan and the others. After all the core soldiers were finally gathered, they each planned to travel to their respective colored worlds, and destroy the Grand Cores of the Horizon Ladders. They would put their own symbols in there place. They were each challenged by a Pantera robot. Mai defeated the purple one, which turned out to be the true Grand Core. Their plan was put on hold when Otherworld King bought a section fo Grand Rolo to Earth, as part of his own plan. Now on Earth, the core soldiers made their first objective to take back Magisa's deck. Mai and the others tried to battle the soldiers blocking their way, allowing Dan and Magisa to get through to the end. Mai, along with Dan and Clackey, were trapped in an alternate dream world, where they began to lose their memories. Kajitsu freed Dan, who was able to restore Magisa's deck and save the others. Later, Mai, with Kenzo's help planned to hack into computer systems to stop the military, who was on Otherworld King's side. This was only a temporary success, as it was defeated when Otherworld King began using Otherworld King's power to destroy the world. When it came time for the final battle with Otherworld King, Mai lent Dan Beelzebeat, and watched the battle, which was projected to the world through the soldiers' core symbols. When Magisa planned to separate the two worlds, she was upset, wanting to stay with Serge. However, he encouraged her to stay on Earth, as a human girl. In the epilogue, Mai attends a reunion of the core soldiers.Brave  Mai, who had now grown her hair long and quit her blog, met Dan again after two years. She invited him to the future, which was invaded by mazoku, so that he could battle seriously again. Mai had already taken a role on the crew of the Sophia, Clackey's ship. Out of everyone, Mai was the one who had the most faith in Dan. Because Youth, the Sophia's pilot, disliked Dan, she tried to convince him to watch Dan. When the Sophia traveled to Oct, Mai and Plym stayed behind in the ship while the others went to meet the queen. Zazie broadcasted the incident around the world. Seeing what occurred, Mai decided to go over there too. She met Barone, who had been banished and stripped of his land. Mai wanted to get to know him better, despite disliking him, because he and Dan acknowledged each other. Barone asked Mai why she came to the future. Rather than answering him directly, she explained that she had felt empty since the time she fought as a core soldier in Grand Rolo, and all she felt she could do since then was grow her hair long. After both Dan and Barone are injured by the Prison General Duc, Mai starts to become afraid. She admits that maybe it was a bad idea to bring Dan into the future. However, she continued to support Dan. Seeing how he spoke to Barone, after it was revelaed that mazoku were humans, she thought that he had matured. Dan and Barone remained together for a while, fighting against Duc's squad. When Barone decided to leave, in order to calm the chaos in Oct, he and Dan battled over it. Watching the battle, Mai realized that she as well had to do what was proper. She left along with Barone. Though some of the mazoku wouldn't accept Mai as a human, she fought against them, in order to earn their loyalty to herself and Barone. She also stole the Zodiac X-rares that Duc had, to give to Barone. During her time with the mazoku, Mai battled with a deck that was a combination of Dan's former deck, and the brave killer deck. She found the recipe for Dan's deck at a museum, which also indicated the day of Dan's death; The same day which he came to the future. Realizing this meant he wouldn't return, after she heard that Dan and Barone will battle and the winner will pull the trigger, Mai thinks it's possible that was the reason why Dan wouldn't return. Mai challenged Dan to a battle, hoping to prevent him from fighting any more. During their battle, Mai and Dan were both determined to win. Mai tried to sway Dan not to pull the trigger, but its useless. Mai explained that she had wanted to be together with the other Core Soldiers like in the past, especially Dan. She confessed that she loved him before Dan declared his last attack. Dan defeated her, stating that his objective in the future was to keep winning, but he invited her back to the Sophia, saying that he needed her. Before the final battle, though she was still worried about it, Mai went to see Dan. She asked Dan if there was anything he wanted. He requested curry, so she planned to make it for him, and the two shared a kiss.\u00a0During the battle, she was confident that Dan would win, and they could return to their time and face it together. However, during the battle, the system was damaged. Dan would be unable to return. When he activated the Zodiac X-rares, he realized that he would become the trigger, not just pull it. As he sacrificed himself, Mai was devastated. In the epilogue, before returning to her time with Kenzo and Suzuri, Mai gave Clackey a photo they had taken earlier of the two of them and Dan. She also kept a copy for herself. She and Kenzo talked about how they could face their past again. She wondered if someday, they would meet Dan again.Deck  Her deck is purple, and focuses on curse combos. In Brave, she uses mainly red, the same cards Dan used in the past, combined with a brave killer deck.

He wears a red shirt, blue pants, a light blue jacket, and gloves.Personality  A major Battle Spirits fan who is always enthusiastic to play. He likes to use red, because he think it's cool. He also has a hobby of mixing strange seasoning in his rice.Biography  Hajime dreamed of being able to meet the spirits. As a result, his parents developed a battle system where they could really materialize. At a Battle Spirits shop, he met with a strange man with an afro (secretly champion player Arata Yakushiji) who battled and defeated him. He asked Hajime which card he wanted to use, and explained that he needed a \"destined card\" to play. Hajime used a vending machine to get a card which would be his deck's hero. He was able to pull The HeroDragon Lord-Dragon, a new burst spirit. Hajime later battled against Kimari Tatsumi, the daughter of one of the battle systems co-creators, and defeated her. Some time later, when the battle system had become an international success, Hajime's parents left for a work trip. Hajime went to live with Kimari and her family. He and Kouta, Kimari's younger brother, went to the Battle Spirits shop, where they met Tegamaru Tanashi, another red user. Hajime was anxious to battle him, but Tegamaru wasn't interested, and wouldn't acknowledge him by his name, simply calling him \"Headband.\" Hajime instead battled Kobushi Nigiri, a member of Tegamaru's team, who also used burst cards, and won the match. To battle against Tegamaru, he needed to defeat both Kobushi, and another teammate, Chihiro. Although he was able to win against Chihiro too, due to a mix up, Hajime battled with Tegamaru's deck, so the battle didn't count. During the Heroes Championship, Hajime was again matched with Kobushi. He won, and moved to the next round, when his opponent would finally be Tegamaru, whether or not he was worthy yet. He was defeated in this match. Despite his loss, he continued training under the Battle Spirits Sage. Because he successfully won in the High Ranker League, he was allowed to continue competing in the national tournament. He also was able to get a new X-rare, The ExplosionHero Lord-Dragon-Bazzel. Hajime became one of the three finalists in the national tournament, after defeating Isami Serizawa in the final round. Because of this, Tegamaru called him by his name. During spring break, Hajime went to a beach on vacation with the Tatsumi family. There, they met Dr. Sunset, an evil scientist and acquaintance of Hajime's parents. Hajime, along with Kouta and Kimari (and later, Kataru and  Manabu too) traveled around the world in Dr. Sunset's submarine, the Genius. They met various competitors in the world tournament, including Nora Nyao, Renard William Ardley and Abura Katabura, the later two of which Hajime got the chance to battle. He also got a new nexus card in Italy. When he returned to Japan, he was reunited Tegamaru and his friends. They talked about the Hero Championship outside of the unfinished arena. There, he discovered that Mika was the true identity of the Battle Spirits Sage. He helped Kataru run for student council president, once school started again. Hajime got a new X-rare, The GlacialHero Lord-Dragon-Glazar, out of a Battle Spirits tower. At first, he was unsure if he could use it with his deck, as it was white, but Isami encouraged him to try it out. They battled, but Hajime lost, as he wasn't familiar with how to properly use Glazar. Later, he received a pack from Galaxy Watanabe, which contained another new X-rare, Lord-Dragon-Saviour. At the start of the world tournament, he was matched up against Freddy Jason, a representative from America. There, Lord-Dragon-Saviour finally made its debut, leading him to victory. Hajime made it up to the final round, where he faced Tegamaru. He claimed that rather than battling to make his dream come true, now he was battling for everyone's dreams. Although he managed to break Tegamaru's imposing stance, he lost the battle in the end. Although he was disappointed, and apologized to his parents, who of course didn't mind, he decided to cheer on Tegamaru in his match against Arata. Hajime was bothered by Tegamaru's behavior, which continued even after he defeated Arata, and weren't appropriate for a hero. He wished Tegamaru would realize all the things he lost sight of, like his love for the spirits, and remain with his friends again. Because of this, Kimari and his other friends got Tegamaru to return to Japan, and set up a battle between him and Hajime at Hero Stadium. Hajime manages to not only defeat Amaterasu-Dragon, but win the battle. In the epilogue he meets Afrone at the card shop, who challenges him, and reveals that his real identity is Arata.Deck  Hajime's deck is red and white, and uses burst. His deck has contained at some point, the following.Trivia: Appearances:  Battle Spirits Heroes anime Battle Spirits Heroes (Manga- Jump) Battle Spirits Heroes (Manga- Ace)Battle Spirits Shounen Gekiha Dan  Battle Spirits Shounen Gekiha Dan (\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30b9\u30d4\u30ea\u30c3\u30c4 \u5c11\u5e74\u6fc0\u8987\u30c0\u30f3\u00a0; Battle Spirits Clash Boy Dan) is an anime inspired by Bandai's Battle Spirits trading card game, and produced by Sunrise.

The DragonEmperor Siegfried!\"Appearance  Toppa has messy orange hair. His eyes are red. Normally, he wears a black shirt, red jacket, and tan pants. He has a short sleeve version of his outfit to wear in the summer.Personality  Always enthusiastic and optimistic, but tends to be clueless, especially to the feelings of other people. Regardless, he's generally well meaning. A huge Battle Spirits fan, he would prefer to devote all his time to it, and thus does poorly at school, when he's not sleeping through it.Biography (Anime)  Toppa Bashin lives in an apartment with his mother, Hayami, and his pet mouse, Aibou. His father, Touha, left when he was young. He picked up many mannerisms from his father, and also inherited a red stone, which was a key to opening the alternate world of Isekai. It also allows Aibou to speak. He attends Toaru Elementary School at the beginning of the series, where he's a 6th year student. When his father left, Bashin was very shy, and couldn't make friends well. He opened up when his mother taught him Battle Spirits. He was then always happy to make friends with everyone he met. He was able to win over even J, his rival and the \"prince of the Battle Spirits World\" and the idol, My Sunshine (aka Suiren). He also was close friends with Striker, a soccer player from his elementary school, and his childhood friend, Meganeko. Because J, Striker and Suiren were all chosen card battlers like him, they became very close, often battling among each other in tag matches. However, this led to Bashin neglecting Meganeko. When Bashin learns that J's father,  Kiano, is a member of Thousand Spirits Group, he's determined to help J. They make a promise to defeat King Uchuuchouten, Thousand Spirits Group's leader, together. Despite this, J becomes a member of Thousand Spirits Group himself. Bashin believes they're still friends, and is anxious to meet them. He and some others go to Kyoto, where J will be appearing at an event. During this time, J defeats Bashin. He assaults him, and denies that the two are friends. Though only Meganeko can notice, for the first time, Bashin is actually crushed. Still determined to get J back, Bashin, along with Striker, Suiren, Meganeko, Kyouka and (at the last moment)  Masako form Team Shomen Toppa to compete in the next tournament. They're able to win against Numbers Elite, Thousand Spirits Groups team, but as J didn't participate, Bashin still is unsatisfied. J finally battles against him in a special match, where King Uchuuchouten actually brings the arena into Isekai World. Bashin wins the match, and is reunited with J. Soon after, Bashin and the other chosen card battlers are invited to participate in the King Uchuuchoten Cup. Bashin and J are set to battle together in a tag. The tournament is actually a trap to acquire their stones, and the opponents are a mostly-brainwashed Numbers Elite. As Bashin's friends are eliminated in the tournament, they're captured, leaving only Bashin and J remaining. Bashin feels guilty, but J inspires him to keep continuing. Bashin and J face Smile (Number Four) and Seven in their match. They're able to win, and the two split up afterwards. Bashin goes to take on Number Nine. He wins the battle, but the power Number Nine stole from King Uchuuchouten, and all his rage with it, transfer back to King Uchuuchouten. He becomes Bashin's final opponent. When Bashin finally wins, Isekai World fades. All of the stones' powers are lost, and King Uchuuchouten reverts to his real identity, Touha Bashin. In the epilogue, Bashin says farewell to J, who is going to study abroad in America. He finds that his father is leaving again. As a parting gift, Bashin receives a new red stone. He calls J, who can also access Isekai World again, and they have a battle there.(Manga)  Like in the anime, Bashin is a 6th grader who attends Toaru Elementary. He lives with his mother, and his father left when he was younger. Bashin takes care of some of the house work, because his mother usually works the night shift. He believes in the importance of bonds and plays Battle Spirits because of his bond with his father. One day, Bashin met a man on the streets, and gave him the bag of chips he was eating. As a reward, the man gave Bashin the red cornerstone, and an envelope with a card inside. When Bashin opened it later, he realized that the card was blank. He considered it junk until a Nazo-Otona appeared and requested it. He and Bashin battled over the card in Isekai World, which turned into The DragonEmperor Siegfried in battle, allowing Bashin to win. Another Nazo-Otona, Number Nineteen, appeared in Bashin's school. Bashin tried to stop him from attacking Meganeko, but was knocked down the stairs. Striker saved Bashin, but was injured in the process. Bashin defeated Number Nineteen, and was rewarded with the green cornerstone that Nineteen possessed, and another blank card. Feeling bad for Striker, who wouldn't be able to play soccer anymore, Bashin dressed up as a nurse and came to the hospital to take care of him. He taught Battle Spirits to Striker. Bashin attended a tournament with a High Ranker Pass that Suiren gave to him. There, Bashin and J get into a battle, and also clash over ideals. The battle is left unresolved because Bashin passes out. When Bashin and the others found J again, he became an ally of Smile. Bashin defeated J, and they were able to come to an understanding and join forces against Smile. Smile had sealed Bashin and his friends, as well as others, in an alternate world. They would battle with their freedom at risk. With help from his friends, and all the people who cheered him on, Bashin defeated Smile. Before returning to the real world, he spoke with Uchuuchouten, who thanked him. Bashin realized it was his father.(New Year Special)  Toppa arrived in Yukimura's world in order to stop the  Nazo Otona's plan to fuse Iseikai World and Yukimura's world together and turn it into his own personal paradise. He encountered Yukimura and his friends, and realized they weren't frozen because of Yukimura's power as a card battler. Bashin dragged Yukimura to the stadium to fight Nazo Otona, in a 2 VS 1 Battle. They win thanks to the effect of Burning Spirit, saving the world as a result. Before he fades from Yukimura's world, he give Burning Spirit to Yukimura.Deck  Bashin uses a primarily red deck, but adds some blue later on, in order to combat blue deck destruction. His deck is focused on cards with the keyword Evolution. His deck has contained at some point the following:Trivia Appearances:  Battle Spirits Shounen Toppa Bashin anime Battle Spirits Shounen Toppa Bashin (manga) Battle Spirits: Kiseki no Hasha (PSP) Battle Spirits Digital Starter (DS) Battle Spirits New Years SpecialThe Gigantic Thor  This spirit was a previous card of the month.

Each is based on a symbol of the western zodiac. Historically, the power of these cards has been used as a weapon.Usage  Dan Bashin and humanity's forces decided to collect the 12 Zodiac X-rares to destroy the core which created the continent Oct, thus preventing the Earth from resetting itself. Once all 12 were collected, the remaining requirement was to bring them to the fortress of the gods, which was hidden somewhere at the North Pole. There, a trigger needed to be pulled to activate them. Dan and Barone battled over this purpose, using the 12 Zodiac X-rares in battle, and generating energy. In the Kerokero Ace manga version, the power of the 12 Zodiac X-rares were also used to open a portal to Otherworld. No trigger was required like in the anime. In the V Jump manga version, there was no reset to prevent at all. The cards were simply being used as weapons to battle mazoku with.Cards Scorpio  The ScorpioKnight Scor-Spear (\u5929\u880d\u795e\u9a0e\u30b9\u30b3\u30eb\u30fb\u30b9\u30d4\u30a2)- A blue spirit, released in BS10.

It was a card handed down to Queen Gilfam. She lent it to Duc to battle against Dan. After Duc was defeated, it was given to his son, Rugain.

He wears a yellow shirt and red tie, with a short, black and white jacket. He had tan pants, and a belt, with his deck case attached. In his battle form, he has yellow and white armor, which flows out behind him. In Brave, he wears a blue and white captain's uniform, with a cape and hat.Personality  Clackey adores girls, be they human or spirits, and is often seen around them. He's charming and flirtatious. He's also protective, and loyal to his friends. He can be quite laid back, and likes to take things as they come. He can go into long-lasting depression if rejected by a girl.Biography Gekiha Dan  Clackey is first seen in the Mimi village, protecting the ladies there. At first, he mistakesDan 's group to be Deathmatch Dan, a group of gangsters that steal village's rare cards. He challenges Dan to a duel, and there the leader of the Mimi Village, Sophia, explained what happened to the village. The followers of Otherworld King came and attacked their village, taking all the men to work on the horizon ladder. Zungurii explains that's its the same situation for them too, his village was also attacked and the people taken. Sophia realizes her mistake, and after the duel (which Clackey lost) welcomes Dan and his group to the village. Afterwards, the real Deathmatch Dan came to the village. Dan and Clackey got into an argument as to who gets to fight the group's leader, Dark Lord Jin, and it soon became a fistfight which Dan won. Although Dan got a very bad hand, he was able to overwhelm Jin's curse deck. Clackey was also present when the Mimi village's guardian deity, the DeityCatastrophe-Dragon, made its appearance in the shrine. He met Hideto Suzuri, who volunteered to protect the card from thieves. Unknown to them, Suzuri, and X-rare collector, actually wants the card, and came close to stealing it. However Dan stopped him. Afterwards Suzuri left the village. Clackey joined Dan in their journey. They met up with Viole Mai, another bearer of Core's light. She was looking for Kousuke, and soon Kousuke shows himself. The two battle, and Kousuke was defeated. Mai agrees to give the group a free ride in her ship, the Violet. They came into the entrance for the Red world, guarded by Mira, a blue card battler. Clackey, who always wants to impress girls, was disappointed in Mira's stone-cold reaction to his actions and duels her. Although Mira causes Clackey suffering (by milling his angels) Clackey still won and was able to reach into Mira's heart. After defeating her, they were allowed to enter the red world. The group soon went to the red horizon ladder. While Dan dueled Kajitsu, Clackey and the others freed the Otherworlders (who were being forced to work on the ladder). Although the mission was a success, the match of Dan and Kajistu went undecided. Afterwards Mai decided to kick out Dan and the others out of her ship. As she was about to depart, Clackey reveals he has the ship's key and will give it back if Mai defeats him in a duel. Mai and complies and wins, but through the duel Clackey says that before meeting Dan, he was just like her. Now, he is not. The group headed for the blue world, where a tournament will take place. The winner will get a chance to meet the Otherworld King, so Dan and Clackey both enter the tournament. Clackey was witness to Dan's match with Julian Fines, the former red soldier. He was also witness to the battle of Suzuri and Randel from the white world, and the battle of Dan and Gaana, from the Green world. Clackey's own match was againstLightspeed Shula, a feared duelist who can finish opponents in one turn. Shula is actually a former prince the blue world, and his sister, the princess, seeks help from Dan and the others to stop here brother (who, after winning the tournament, plans to take revenge on Brustom, the present ruler of the blue world). Clackey manages to defeat Shula and change his ways, and as gratitude the princess gives him an x-rare, The ArcAngelia Isfiel . Despite having made it this far, he was defeated by Hyoudo Kenzo, a talented young card battler. Granted, Clackey wasn't too happy about it, and wasn't in a cheerful mood when he watched the duel of Kenzo and Dan. Dan won the tournament and demands to see the Otherworld King, saying that he must step down from his place and leave Grand Rolo. Brustom decides that it cannot be, but if Dan wishes to meet the Otherworld King, he must fight him first. Dan lost, which made him Yuuki 's servant. He entrusted the rest of the team to Clackey. Magisa and the others decided to unite the core soldiers. They were successful with Kenzo but not with Suzuri, who has become blue king as part of Leon (an ally of the Otherworld king)'s plan to keep the soldiers away from each other. The group also has Kajitsu, whom Yuuki has entrusted to them Clackey was unsure about Kajitsu though, because he knows that she's one of those that caused the suffering of many. Not long after, Leon came demanding Kajitsu. Both Kenzo and Mai fought him and were defeated, and Clackey decided to duel him. During the duel, he decides to protect Kajitsu, and won using his new X-Rare, the ArcAngelia Isfiel. Leon soon decided to burn down the forest in a desperate attempt to bring out Kajitsu, forcing the core soldiers to leave the forest. The group made a stop at the yellow world, meeting Kotarou, a pentan duelist. Kotarou and Zungurii duel, and Clackey and the others watched. Not one of them were happy with the duel because every time Zungurii lost a life one of them gets forced into a pentan costume. Zungurii won that duel. After leaving that place, Yuuki handed back Dan to them. The group soon realizes something is wrong with Dan-his core is broken. As they think about this problem, the Otherworld King's forces come again, forcing the Violet to flee. The core system powering the Violet was broken, so Clackey and Zungurii had to fix it. It was not easy, since it was at the front of the ship. However, they did it and escaped. Only after that did they find out what Mai did, separating from the group in order to stall for time. They found out that Namii the scorpion from the Purple world has captured Mai. They were able to pinpoint the location of the prison, but the first gate was guarded by Gouda. Dan defeated him easily. Then, Brustom and Heliostom challenged both Clackey and Dan to a tag duel. Because it is Dan and Clackey's first time, there was a lot of conflict of strategy. Clackey wasn't at all pleased when Dan depleted his Cherubim for Dan's Meteorwurm. However, they were able to put aside their strategies, and win the duel. They then searched around for Mai. They wandered around and fell into Namii's traps, however at the end of the duel (which Mai won) they were released. They then left the prison. They then met up with Yuuki, who has betrayed Otherworld king after finding out his true intentions for Kajitsu. They picked up Suzuri from the blue world (after dueling him). Clackey then participated in Dan's plan to destroy all the horizon ladders. The bearers of core's light split up and went to their respective worlds to destroy the ladder there. Waiting for each of them was a Pantera doll. Clackey battled the yellow Pantera and defeated him. After all the bearers defeated the Pantera dolls, Otherworld King revealed that the towers were just dummies and the real energy source were the dolls. Thus, the towers were activated, merging Earth and Otherworld. They soon faced the President, who was doubtful of them and regarded them as enemies. Hoewever, Dan defeated him and since then the President has been spying on Otherworld king for Dan and the others. They then decided to search for Magisa's deck. While doing so, they fell trap to the Doctor, who knocked them out and placed them in a dream world. Fortunately they overcame the trap, and Dan beat the Doctor (who has Magisa's deck). Clackey and the others searched for Yuuki and Kajitsu when the two turned up missing. Turns out that the two visited their old home, and got attacked by Otherworld King's assassin. The two survived the assault. When Kajitsu died and Otherworld King acquired Mother Core, Clackey was one of those who mourned. He was then witness to Magisa's battle against Leon. Magisa pulled off an amazing victory using a deck full of 39 spells/nexus cards and only 1 spirit. Clackey supported Dan until the end, giving him his \"The ArcAngelia Isfiel\" card for his battle against Otherworld king. Together with the other bearers and many other people and Otherworlders, they watched Dan win against Otherworld King. Clackey was seen with the other Beares in a reunion.Brave  Clackey became the captain of his own ship, the Beautiful Sophia. He, along with Mai, was summoned to the Era by Kazan to help fight off the Mazoku. From the start, Clackey fully supported Dan. Because Youth didn't, Clackey challenged him to a battle, in order for Youth to see what Dan had to go through on the battlefield. In the town of Sevan, they met a girl named Gizelle, who was stuck in an arranged marriage to a mazoku, Balgada. Clackey fell in love with her, and tried to stop this. Though Dan successfully won her freedom, it turned out that she was already engaged. Clackey later began to doubt that the future could ever be saved. He wondered why it was Dan battling the mazoku, rather than him. They had a battle, and he came to understand the reason. Because Dan wouldn't waver like anyone else. Eventually, the Sophia went to space, to find the North Pole, which they needed to use the 12 Zodiac X-rares they had been collecting. There, they encountered Angers Loche, an astronaut who had been in a cold sleep since the time the mazoku were at the beginning of their conquest. Of course, Clackey fell for her right away. He stayed by her side when she was feeling guilty for also allowing a prisoner to awaken. Angers returned with the Sophia crew to Earth. Clackey decided that he wouldn't return to his own time, because he had no family or friends waiting. He told Angers that he hoped to have a future with her. It was clear that she returned his feelings, as they were together as a couple afterwards. After Dan and Barone had their final battle, using the power of the 12 Zodiac X-rares, Dan realized that he was the trigger to launch their energy, and would have to sacrifice his life. Clackey pleaded to Magisa to try and save him, though his final fate was left unknown. In the epilogue, he meets with Barone to shake hands, symbolizing the start of peace between humans and mazoku. He thinks that Dan would be happy with the future now.Deck  Clackey uses yellow, and his deck is based around the light effect. He includes lots of feminine spirits. In Brave, he also uses red.

He was raised on a plantation in Sterling, Massachusetts. Growing up he became best-friends with a mouse called Geegaw Hackwrench (father of Gadget Hackwrench). After his adolescence, he went to the Emily Carr University of Art and Design in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and exhilarated in his animations made with store-bought drawing ink and watercolor paint, and has a master's degree in animation. During animation of his short \"Geegaw Travels the World in 23 Minutes\", He met Laura Burklestein, his girlfriend and future wife. After college, him and Laura were married and moved to Denmark, Wisconsin and had two children. According to Splaat, he said they had a good life and barley had any financial problems, But their world came crashing down when the fiercest serial-killer in the world, Agent 47, intruded their house at 1:45 am, July 9th, 1993. He first attempted to kill the children, but failed because they were at John's grandfather's plantation, where John was raised. He then went for Laura and shot her two times in the private parts. John (who just returned from a late shift at the local McDonald's) heard the shots as he turned into the driveway, grabbed his AK-47 he got from a friend in the army who recovered it from a war and killed Agent 47. He rushed to Laura to aid her, and took her to the local airport where she was airlifted to the next town's small hospital, where she died of blood-loss. Morned by his dead family and sicked that he killed, John went into deep depression and had attempted to commit suicide by various means, such as walking in front of a train. John later tried dark magic to bring the departed (including Agent 47) back to life. During one of the rituals, he made a error in his attempt and transformed himself into a ink bottle with magazine clippings for eyes and a mouth and gained the ability to enter a different universe. He married Lisa Clips, a cross between scissors and a collage. They had Splaat, their son.Reception  People thought he was scary.

They're where you'll be gaining most of your levels, and they also can strike your enemies back. Remember, you unlock the barracks \u00a0at level 1, you unlock the factory at\u00a0command center level 4,\u00a0the generals quarters \u00a0at command center level 6\u00a0and last, you get the fleet academy \u00a0at command center level 11, with barracks at level 1. You can also\u00a0INSTANTLY unlock a troop for research by winning it, you'll get the troop, and have it instantly be trained to level 1. However, if you do not have the specific building to train that unit, you will not be able to train that unit until you get the building. Infantry (Barracks) Mechanized  (Factory) AI Units (Fleet Academy) General Units (Generals Quarters)Buildings  See also All Building Statistics There are five categories of buildings in Edgeworld, although Kabam claims that Defense buildings really aren't buildings, even though they are listed as buildings, are built as buildings, and are affected by building boosts such as the 99% Accelerator. This clarification was made to avoid having to pay out prizes for the level 22 build-a-thon event when players realized it was shorter to upgrade turrets than to upgrade other buildings. This is just a furtherance of their scamming.PvE Stats News New Faction Bases are Here!, 2012 Dec 19  New PvE Bases above 10K were added. Kabam did not create missions for all 3 Faction Bases for each Level after 10K. This is likely a Bug or omission since if your Player is of high enough Level your \"Daily Mission\" (viewable by pressing the \"Mission Button\" in the far lower right corner of the Screen) called \"Stomping Grounds\" will ask you to \"Defeat a Helio base of level 12,000 or higher\". There is no Helio Base of exactly 12K, only higher leveled ones; whereas a lower Level Player will get Missions that are less than 10K and there are Faction Bases of exactly the Level called for. Now there are no missions after 70K.Unit Statistics Table  To find the Map upgrade for each troop, divide its Training by 4 min/L.Definitions Damage Rate (DRt)  The DRt formula is [Damage] HP*[Rate]/min 1 min/60 s. For example, the formula for Rhinos level 4 would be 8 HP*30/min 1 min/60 s = 4 HP/s because it has a damage of 8 and a rate of 30. A DRt/Sz is the DRt divided by Transport size in warp slots. A unit that takes one slot and has a DRt of 1000 is twice as powerful as a unit that takes two slots and has a DRt of 1000 in the sense that your Warp Gate can hold more damage. That makes Disruptors slightly more powerful than Pulse Tanks (in the Warp Gate; not standing alone, side by side). More useful are statistics for DRtRn/Sz and (H+DRtRn)/Sz for they show how badly Pyros and other weak units do alone.Speed (Sp)  The Sp formula is [Speed] px/s. A turret or harvester is 70 pixels on each side and sqrt(2 * 70)=99 pixels on each slant. Slower units are more useful to draw fire if near turrets, swifter units to fire on far turrets or sweep up buildings. Range and splash damage of some units make up for their slowness.Infantry (Units Trained in Barracks) Marine Rhino Raider Pyro Specter Lancer  Replaces Terraknors with new abilities and backstory.Bomba Berserker Mechanized (Units Trained in Factory) Hornet Titan Shrike Disruptor Pulse Tank  When a team unit is killed, pulse tanks go into \"beast\" mode for 12 seconds, dealing AoE damage.Decimator Battle Cruiser Blast Bot Special Units (Units Trained in Fleet Academy) Chimera Devastator Sentinel Incineraptor Shrike General information  Shrikes are good for destroying bases under a low time limit. Normally, it has a moderate damage and a moderate health, but a Hornet may be a better choice if you are not in a rush. Like all units, the higher the level the better and these become real killing machines at L8. Cheap and quick to build, these little beauties will serve you well if you learn how to use them properly. Hint, use them with Rhinos, or Bombas at a ratio of about 4 to 1; i.e. 4 Shrikes to every Rhino/Bomba. Shrikes are trained in the Factory. Shrikes require a Level-6 Tech Lab to research.Stats Disruptor General information  They take much time to train, though, so be careful to not waste them or let them keep going even when the battle looks like it will obviously end in defeat. They are one of the oldest units in the game. Disruptors are trained in the Factory.Stats  A one stop shop for all your statistics and tables. The tables you are most likely to want are\u00a0Base Design,\u00a0Building Statistics\u00a0and\u00a0Unit Statistics. The rest are listed below.Bomba General information  The Bomba is exclusive to Aurora-1 colony but can be transferred to Main Base using the Warp Gate. Bombas explode when they die, and leave a mid-range spreading attack upon nearby buildings. The last attack may be very useful to clear a path for other combat units. Their better statistics to Rhinos or Titans make them the next replacement. Group the Bombas before Specters, Chimeras, or Devastators for effective attack against a tougher Base, before Raiders for resource harvesting on Farms, or before Decimators or Incineraptors for the top bases.Sales Platoons are on SALE!, 2014 Sep 4 8:00 (1d3h)  \u00a025 5, \u00a040 5, \u00a045 5Command Center General information  Often called CC for short, this is the main building in the game. All other Building's Levels are limited to the same level as the CC, or lower, and therefore all progress is limited by CC level. In March 2013 new Buildings were introduced which had other Buildings besides the CC limit their construction Level; one example is the\u00a0Constructor which is limited by the CC Level and the Defense Lab's Level. Click on the CC and its Build key or the Build key on the right HUD to bring up a list of buildings that can be installed on its Base. Base size is increased at L13, L14, L16, and L17 CC. If your CC is destroyed in combat, you lose the battle, so be sure to surround it in a cluster of turrets and buildings. The CC is not always the target of troops; most troops target the sniper turrets first. When you destroy a CC, you win the battle even if you had not attacked the other Buildings. So, the best strategy for winning a battle is to target the CC and get as near as possible, so you can bring in Battle Cruisers, Blast Bots, Bombas, Decimators,\u00a0Pulse Tank, Specters, or Devastators to finish it off. General Strom's Plasma Cannon and General Thrax's Focus Fire and Energy Beam can bypass other buildings altogether and win a battle in seconds. This is an extremely good way to defeat a base, although it does require a\u00a0General's Orders.Stats Aurora  See\u00a0Aurora-1Caldera  See\u00a0Caldera-2Eclipse  See\u00a0Eclipse-3 More information can be found in Base Design.Warp Gate General information  This building is required if you wish to attack another player's or Faction's Base. Each Warp Gate has three warps only. Warps are refilled after 30 minutes to attack again or using time boosts. Once your units have destroyed a base, surviving units go back to the staging area whereas the ones that died don't. Upgrading your Warp Gate will raise the life and capacity of the Gate. General Strom's Cavalry ability increases warp capacity in combat (but not for transferring troops). You can have additional Gates on your Aurora-1, Caldera-2 and Eclipse-3\u00a0Colonies. You can construct a second gate in every base once you get a level 11 Command Center.\u00a0The maximum warp space obtained in combination with\u00a0General Strom\u00a0and\u00a0Warp Boost,\u00a0which will generate a total of 630 spaces, will allow 58\u00a0Decimators/Incineraptors\u00a0per attack. (650+210+20=880/15=58)Specter General information  A Specter is best used to take down X-1 Cannons and Tesla Towers. When upgraded and paired with Titans or Rhinos they can be formidable. There are several high level Faction bases where XP can be acquired easily with Specters, or one Specter, without taking a single hit or losing any units (like Level-1000 Helio and Maar's Barracks and Staging Area). There may also be high-level players in your sector who have bases with equally accessible resources, or buildings that can be destroyed for quick XP; however, be careful not to start any undesirable feuds. \u00a0They are clearly arthropods but are not insects as they do not have 6 legs so they may be crustaceans or close relatives. Specters require a Level-4 Tech Lab to research.Stats Strategy  Save room in your Warp Gate\u00a0for a half dozen of these and send them in the second wave, after\u00a0all in-range Guns have been destroyed, to destroy the HQ. Strengths: Weaknesses:Terraknor General information  You needed to spend a Terraknor Control to train and research Terraknors. The developers clumsily ran a find-and-replace for Terraknors and the Terraknor in the game translations to Lancers, even in the historical messages, and Terraknor was not snagged. There was a glitch in the game that allowed for the training of this unit, without any resource or cores, but exploiters of it were banned.\u00a0 The exploiters have not told how they have done it yet. Weaknesses: Strengths:Pulse Tank General information  Pulse Cores are used to upgrade and build them. They can be acquired from a mission, Zoot's Loot, and mystery boxes, or be bought at Store. You can also get pulse cores when you buy/win the Pulse Core Rack. Pulse Cores cannot be recovered from destroyed Pulse Tanks. These units have the 6th most health in the game after the Decimator, Berserker,\u00a0Battle Cruiser, Sentinel, and Incineraptor. It is best to withdraw the Tanks from a battle earlier if they are overwhelmed by enemy base's defensive towers. Pulse Tanks are very useful when attacking Tesla Towers, as the range of the pulse is greater than that of the tower.Stats Strategy  Because they have a great range and splash damage (in Beast Mode), they are best used to attack short ranged towers and quickly destroy/collect any nearby resources. It is best to use a Pyro or Marine to trigger Beast Mode. Note: There are several high level Faction bases where resources can be acquired easily with Pulse Tanks, or a Pulse Tank, without taking a single hit, or losing any units. There may also be high level Players in your sector who have bases with equally accessible resources, or buildings that can be destroyed for quick XP; however be careful not to start any undesirable feuds. All of this is easier with Decimators Weaknesses: Concussion Turrets, Sniper Turrets, Corrosive Turrets, and Incendiary Turret. Concussion Turrets tend to waste the tank's beast mode attack, by stunning (and thereby immobilizing) it shortly. Sniper Turrets can target the tanks and finish them in very few hits. Incendiary Turrets and Corrosive Turrets set it ablaze (to the same of all machinery).See also Aurora-1 General information  Kabam Support Center: Aurora One Colony The base is located in the frozen wastelands of Cerulea IV. To create this colony you need Aurora-1 Schematic. This base includes a new Warp Gate; initially only combat units manufactured/trained at Aurora-1 could be sent from Aurora-1 but later units could be transfered with the Gate having a new Transfer option added. Later another Gate was granted. The Engineering Lab and Fleet Academy were granted on 2012 Sep 25. All Research (except for Bombas, which requires a Tech Lab on your A1) is still done from the Main Base, and your researched Units can be built on both Bases (except for Bombas which can only be built on your A1). If you want Bombas on your Main Base you must transfer them using the A1's Warp Gate (or Staging Areas, with the size of transfer still limited by the capability of your A1 Warp Gates). Any Fleet Academy Troops require a\u00a0Fleet Academy on your A1 in order to build those Troops on your A1; again you can transfer A1\u00a0 Fleet Academy Troops from your A1 to your Main Base if you wish by clicking on your A1's Warp Gate or Staging Areas. Resources can now be shared between the two bases by clicking a Supply Depot and selecting Transfer Resources. Troop Energizers, Combat Tactics, etc. apply only to the base where you used it; if you were at Aurora-1 it is only for Aurora-1 units and vice-versa.Defense Turrets Stats  Editors note: This page needs to be Updated Often.Gameplay  Edgeworld is an online strategic-tower defense style. Players must build a\u00a0Base\u00a0and attack (and defend from) enemy\u00a0Factions\u00a0(Kabam-generated bases)\u00a0and players. Enemy factions currently attack through the\u00a0Defense Simulator, whereas they used to attack players multiple times during the day at predetermined intervals. Players level up with experience gained by\u00a0Training Units,\u00a0Researching units, attacking enemy factions and players, building and upgrading\u00a0structures, and using the Defense Simulator.\u00a0By leveling up, the players gain a cumulative boost in attack and defense power (+10% per level, not shown anymore but still in effect). Player attacks are restricted to number of\u00a0Warps\u00a0available, ranging from a minimum of 3 to a maximum of 12, depending on possession or lack of a\u00a0secondary base\u00a0and of an\u00a0additional Warp Gate. A warp regenerates every 30 minutes. A level up automatically replenishes maximum number of warps available. Attacking an online player will use two warps instead of only one. Factions, the NPC of this game, are considered constantly offline for this purpose. A\u00a0store\u00a0exist, in which players may exchange\u00a0Platinum, the universe's currency for items, which may increase combat capabilities, speed up construction times or grant upgrades, for example. Every 20 hours, a player has a free\u00a0Zoot Token, automatically used. This will grant the player a random item selected from the 8 presented to them. The item is selected by the game and cannot actually be chosen. More \"useful\" items tend to cost a lot, and are relatively rare to win in\u00a0Zoot's Loot. Players in Edgeworld may join an\u00a0Alliance\u00a0and work together for a common objective or help each other. These alliances may conquer territory in a special map and gain various bonuses. A player can then decide how he wants to play the game and either attack other players, only fight in PVE, or compete with other players in weekly\u00a0Player Tournaments, granting them a prize (either an amount of platinum or an item, depending on rank obtained).Level Experience Level-up formula  There is a game bug that occurs occasionally and increases the XP amount to level up to over a billion of XP points. This could be tens or hundreds times the amount of normal XP requirement to level up. The solution is to get this XP either by cancelling current troop training queue and starting a new batch (as the XP amount for troop training is also increased) or by opening some items that give troops. Training Pulse Tanks and opening Pulse Frigates works best in this case.1000+ 5\u200b00000\u2212  A formula that fits to the values above for levels higher than 500 looks like $ \\text{Total Experience}(\\text{level}) = 1000\\ (3\\ \\text{level}^2 - 3\\ \\text{level} -381025) $. Due to some game updates these values seems to be off by one level, so the more correct formula seems to be: $ \\text{Total Experience}(\\text{level}) = 1000\\ (3\\ \\text{level}^2 + 3\\ \\text{level} -381025) $. The experience required to advance from $ \\text{level} $ to $ \\text{level}+1 $ is equal to $ 6000\\ (\\text{level}+1) $. The formulas for level ranges 1..25, 26..99, and 100..500 have similar form, just differs in numerical coefficients.Titan General information  The Titan is a great distractor of turrets and is cool-looking, so it can be paired with Specters if you don't mind the Titan's price in Uranium. Rhinos are generally cheaper distractors. Titans have a higher attack ratio though. Titans resist Concussion Turrets. They are only stopped for a half second instead of 2 seconds. Called file X37-C by Kira. Strengths: WeaknessesStats Combat Buildings Stats Hornet General information  Quick gunships, Hornets shots slow the rate of fire of a tower to 50%. Their craft is not equivalent to a Concussion Turret's, which slows a troop against its health. They can be used with Pyros, which will be killed less efficiently by the turrets due to the slowed tower fire rate, though will probably die anyways; and the Hornets themselves don't have such wonderful health either.Stats Sniper Turret General information  They have a huge range, attack, and health, shoot half as swiftly as other turrets, and require Incendiary Cores to upgrade. Their range covers the whole base and most of the grounds, making Specter, Chimera, and Devastator alone useless\u2014mostly, sometimes the game fails to make the troop check whether a turret is in range\u2014to take out the Command Center until these are gone.See also Rhino General information  Rhino is the defensive unit for the Tech Lab, along with Titans. Rhinos are weaker than Titans but tougher than Marines so they are good to distract defences while your other units destroy the buildings.

Strengths: Weaknesses:Stats Aurora-1 Schematic General information  It can be won at Zoot's Loot, by destroying the Command Center of Maar bases, or bought alone or in the Aurora-1 Gold Kit, Aurora-1 Silver Kit, and Aurora-1 Bronze Kit. It cannot be removed from your Inventory. Having a second Aurora-1 Schematic will not do you any good and it cannot give you a second Aurora-1 base. It will create your Aurora-1 base with: To earn one from Maar, the base's level must be between one third of your level and your own level. (E.g. a level-300 player can attack Maar 100, 150, 200, 250.) The statistic hasn't been made public by Kabam, but it has been determined by careful player testing that the number of attacks required for a schematic drop is 377. \u00a0 Note: Number of successful attacks add up. READ THIS BEFORE ASKING IN COMMENTS. Absolutely nothing will reset/modify negatively the counter. Changing targets due to level up, failing an attack (as in: not destroying the CC, though the attack itself will not count), attacking anything else while racking up successful attacks, not playing for months, starting a new player, changing name, leaving an alliance, creating an alliance, will not reset/reduce the counter. (NOTE: This is not completely true. If your sector is merged with another sector(s), then your feuds list will be wiped clean, including any history of attacks against the factions. A sector merge DOES reset the counter.)

Initially there was some criticism of the cost of Aurora-1, in that the cheapest platinum package you could purchase it with was the 400 (plus the extra 25) Platinum which costs $50 USD.

It is the spiritual successor of Shinden. From having the same bomb, to the same charge shot, it plays almost exactly like Shinden from the first game. In the game, the Phantom possesses a powerful Sub weapon and charge shot. The Roll Napalm can be rapidly fired by going in close to an enemy, resulting in massive damage. Its Super shot is second to the F-117's in power. It uses the Samurai Sword attack that the Shinden used in the first two Strikers 1945 games. It's also been used in another Psikyo shooter called Sengoku Ace. The Samurai Sword is deadly powerful when you activate it while overlapping an enemy. It instantly kills any enemy you overlap, mid-size or otherwise. It can even instantly kill mid-ranked bosses if you overlap the Samurai Sword on them just right! Its two big disadvantages are its main guns are very weak, and the Samurai Sword attack clears away only a narrow swath in front of your fighter. It is only good as an offensive weapon rather than a purely defensive weapon. You are invincible for a while after activating the Samurai Sword, but the invincibility only lasts for the duration of the plane's loop.Details Specifications Trivia F-22 Raptor  The F-22 Raptor is a modern-day stealth fighter from Strikers 1945 III as a playable fighter. In the game, the Raptor is a speedy fighter and its laser can cut through multiple enemies. It is a popular choice for beginner players. Its firepower and Super shot are quite weak, and it tends to smack into slow bullets.Details Specifications Trivia F-117 Nighthawk  The F-117 Nighthawk (named the F-117 Stealth in the game) is a first-generation stealth foghter that appears in Strikers 1945 III as a playable fighter. In Strikers 1945 III, the Nighthawk is a very powerful fighter. It has the most powerful subweapon of all planes. Its Supershot can destroy almost anything in a matter of seconds, including bosses, even at Level 1! It has three big disadvantages. The Nighthawk is a very slow fighter. Also, the Nighthawk is most effective when you attack very close so that the Subweapon can rapid fire. Its main weapon is weak on its own. Finally, its Supershot is next to useless unless you get dangerously close to your desired target, as the Supershot launches only a small distance in front of the Nighthawk.Details Specifications Trivia Strikers 1945 Wiki  Welcome to the STRIKERS 1945 wiki!Strikers 1945 III  Strikers 1945 III (Strikers 1999 in Japan) is a vertically scrolling shoot 'em up released in 1999 by Japanese company Psikyo, publisher of all the Strikers 1945 series and Google Play, APX Software, and Mobirix for the Android version.Story  Fall, 1999. Numerous ultra-small machine groups \"Nano-Machine\" coming from outer space have invaded main weapons and military terminals of each country, and started proliferating. The weapons group infected by these nano-machines continued to attack indiscriminately and destroyed major cities of many countries. The world feared that an all-out nuclear war by an accidental tactical nuclear missile shot might occur! Global troops that barely prevented the invasion of these nano-machines began an operation to eradicate unmanned weapons, but were massively outnumbered. They all thought all hope was lost...until the operations headquarters received mysterious communications. Six trajectories appear shining white in the sky... \"We are \"STRIKERS\", start attacking the enemy behind all this! Take care and support the remaining troops!\" Passing through time of half a century, a new legend of the special force \"STRIKERS\" starts now!Aircraft  A slight change from the previous two titles; the WWII fighter planes have been replaced by modern fighter jets.Unlocking in Android version  In the Android version, unlocking ships are easier. Initially only the Super Hornet is available by default. Every other plane costs 300 rubies to unlock (with the exception of the Stealth Fighter which costs 100 rubies), and opting for a random choice costs 1500 gold coins. The planes that can be unlocked are as follows: You can also watch an ad to unlock a still-locked plane for free with an extra condition that you can only use it once.Gameplay  The player chooses from one of 6 Modern jet fighter aircraft and shoots through eight stages (the first four levels are randomly chosen, and the last four remain the same for each play). Once the game is beaten, a report showing the statistics of the player are displayed, and the game 'loops' with the difficulty much higher. Each game (on default settings) begins with three lives, and an extra life is earned at 600,000 (or 800,000). When all lives are lost, the option to continue is given but the score is reset. After the defeat of the final boss, the player's time, number of medals, and number of enemies killed are added up for each level and, if high enough, marked with three stars. In the Android version, the score is carried on; however, the player must pay gold coins or rubies for each subsequent continues. Another latest feature is the Technical Bonus. During a boss battle, a blue orb is revealed as the weak point. In order to get a 'quick kill', the fighter plane must be extremely close to the orb until it turns red by firing the orb while getting it close to it. Once the fighter plane 'embraces' the orb, the boss is destroyed quickly and adds points for the technical bonus. However revealing the orb from the boss will only take once when it unleashes an attack pattern that is also its weakness. For players, they have to memorize the attack pattern, use a Bomb to dissolve all the bullets, and while in effect, touch the orb while getting close to it for a quick victory.Differences in the Android version  The Android version has the following extra and unique featuresBasics  Each aircraft in 1945 III has three attacks: Normal shot (Tap the A button or hold the C button. Auto-fire in the Android version): A spray of bullets that can be strengthened by collecting power-ups. Charge shot (Hold the A button. Touching the explosion button in the Android version): An attack that varies for each aircraft is based upon a charge meter. The meter is composed of four levels ranging from empty to level 3 (in the Android version, level 1 is indicated by a green explosion, level 2 is yellow, and level 3 is red), and the more the meter is filled, the greater the power of the attack. Charge shots can be cancelled anytime by releasing the A button (in the Android version, charge shots will go on until the meter is empty). Bomb (Press the B button. Touching the Bomb icon in the Android version): An attack that varies for each aircraft; the aircraft drops a bomb to negate enemy bullets while also dealing massive damage. In the Android version, after all free bombs are used up, extra bombs will be charged worth 100 gold coins, then 200 gold coins, and finally 3 rubies.Difficulty level (Android version)  In the Android version, players can select the difficulty of the game. The \"Master\" difficulty seems to correspond to the arcade's second loop.Items Power Ups  Power-Ups are released by shooting certain enemies in Strikers 1945 III, mainly red colored ones. When a power up is collected, the player's normal shot becomes more powerful and a secondary shot (such as homing missiles) may become available to the player. Up to three power ups can be collected, any after that are worth 4000 points. It is possible to 'power down' at any time by colliding with an enemy craft.Bombs  At the beginning of the game, the player has a stock of two bombs. By destroying certain enemy craft, mainly larger ones, a bomb icon will be released and bounce around the screen. When collected, another bomb will be added to the player's stock. A total of nine can be collected, any other icons will reward the player with 10000 points. In the Android version, if the player runs out of free bombs, three additional \"charged\" bombs can be usedMedal Chaining  Medal Chaining works by collecting medals when they are worth 2000 points. Medals are worth 2000 points when they flash white for a split-second. The easiest way to chain is to find targets that release multiple medals when you destroy them (i.e. a medium tank). The medals spin at a consistent rate and complete one rotation even one second. The first medal you pick up to start the chain is worth 2000 points. Chained medals will be worth 2200 points, and counter with yellow numerals appear under your score, indicating how many medals you have thus chained so far (in the Android version, there is no chain indicator meaning you have to count the chained medals manually). Chaining requires precise timing while avoiding enemy attacks. Whatever chain you have accumulated will be broken if you collect a medal valued at less than 2000 points or die. You will then have to start all over if any of these things happen.Upgrading Ships (Android version only)  In the Android version, the player can upgrade their ships through purchasingStages and Bosses  Like it's predecessor, Strikers 1945 II, the first 4 stages are in random order, whereas stages 5-8 are in proper order.\n\n Stage 1 to 4 (random):\n -United States of America: Grand Canyon, Arizona\n Boss: Specter (Gunship Helicopter/stag beetle) Enemies: YF-23A Black Widow II, S-3B Viking, B-1B Lancer, B-2A Spirit, C-17A Globemaster III. -Japan: Offshore defensive platform, Nagasaki\n Boss: Spike Arm (Hovercraft/water strider) Enemies: Arleigh Burke-Class Destroyers, Mitsubishi F-1, Kawasaki C-1, PT Boats. -Russia: Heavy Armory, Kazan\n Boss: Ground Skater (Super-Tank/spider) Enemies: Tanks, Heavy Lift Helicopter, RAH-66 Comanche. -Australia: Sydney, New South Wales\n Boss: Thanatos (Military train/mantis) Enemies: Tanks, AH-64D Longbow Apache, RAH-66 Comanche, CH-64 Chinook, Military Trains.

It was followed by two sequels, Strikers 1945 II in 1997 and Strikers 1945 III (also known as Strikers 1999 in Japan), as well as a version for SNK's Neo Geo called Strikers 1945 Plus (which is actually an alternate version of Strikers 1945 II).Content Story  Summer, 1945 A.D. WWII has come to an end and world peace seemingly returned to mankind. However, a secret and mysterious organization named \"CANY\", thought to be allied with high-ranking officials of the military in several countries, clandestinely plotted to take control. They conspire to conquer the world from within using new yet unseen weapons. The United Military Command Headquarters perceived disturbing activities within several of these countries and quietly gathered a selection of the best planes and fighter pilots to organize a special mission against CANY, christening themselves as \"Strikers\". Now, the secret final World War, untold within the history books, had been set in motion...Gameplay  The player chooses one of 6 WWII-era fighter craft and shoots through eight stages (the first four levels are randomly chosen, and the last four remain the same each play). Once the game is beaten, a report showing how well the player did is displayed, and the game 'loops' with the difficulty much higher. Each game (on default settings) begins with three lives, and an extend is earned at 600,000. In the console ports however, the stage restarts from the beginning if the player loses all of his/her lives. In the Android version, the player can watch an ad to continue where he/she left off for a maximum of two times.Basics  Each plane in Strikers 1945 has three attacks: Normal shot (Tap the A button): A spray of bullets that can be strengthened by collecting power-ups. In the Android version, this is done automatically. Formation attack (Hold the A button until a sound is heard, then release): An attack that summons the plane's wingmen to fire in a specific formation. The strength of this attack is determined by the plane's main shot power (up to four wingmen can support the plane). In the Android version, this is done upon tapping the atom button. Bomb (Press the B button): An attack that varies for each ship, the plane performs its specific bomb attack to clear the screen of bullets. In the Android version, this is done by tapping the bomb button.Aircraft  In the Android version, only the Lightning and Mustang are available by default and every other plane will unlock after 2 hours. All planes other than the Lightning can get an extra power and bomb boost, but will be locked for 2 hours the moment they were selected.Items Power-ups  Power-ups are released by shooting certain enemies in Strikers 1945, mainly red ones. When a power-up is collected, the player's normal shot becomes more powerful and a secondary shot (such as homing missiles) may become available. Up to four power-ups can be collected, any after that are worth 4000 points. It is possible to power-down at any time by colliding with any enemy craft. One thing to note is that while the plane powers up, it also gains a wingman.Bombs  At the beginning of the game, the player has a stock of two bombs. By destroying certain enemy craft, usually larger ones, a bomb icon will be released and bounce around the screen. When collected, another bomb will be added to the player's stock. A total of six can be collected, any other icons will reward the player with 10000 points.Gold bars  Gold bars can be found by destroying certain buildings or enemies and are collected for points. Each bar flashes white for short span of time, and if the player collects the bar while it is flashing it is worth more points. Points range from 200, 500, 1000, and 2000.Stages and Bosses  Stage 1 to 4 (random):\n -Japan\n Boss: Kii (Battleship/One-eyed navy robot) -United States\n Boss: XFB-1 (Flying wing/Spider shield robot) -Germany\n Boss: Doramascher (Tank/Flying battle robot) -USSR\n Boss: Khabarovsk (Blimp/Mine robot) Stage 5: Rocket base\n Boss: Samson (Rocket defense base/Elevator/Arabian Robot) Stage 6: Pacific Ocean to Stratosphere\n Boss: Garam Masala (UFO/Air defense robot) Stage 7: Moon Base\n Boss: Tanegashima (Scorpion/Mutant crab man), Ballus (Robot/Flying wing bomber), or Matcia (Space landing boat/satellite robot) Stage 8: CANY Headquarters\n Boss: Mecha CANY (Crab/Gazami/Alien orb)Version Differences  Originally in the arcade version, if one beats the game by earning all gold medals on every level, the revealed pilots would appear topless. This bonus feature was cut in most releases, which may explain the lack of immediate distribution in North America (as the sequel was released under the name of its predecessor in the US), while the Sega Saturn home version released in Japan avoided the issue completely by clothing all of the pilots and re-arranging their poses, save for the pilot of the Shinden, as he is male.Ports  In Japan, Strikers 1945 was ported to both PlayStation and Sega Saturn in 1996 by Atlus and later ported to PlayStation 2 as part of Psikyo Shooting Collection Vol. 1: Strikers 1945 I & II by Taito. The US PlayStation release of Strikers 1945 by Agetec is actually the sequel Strikers 1945 II under the name of its predecessor. The evidence for this is told mostly through the fighter plane line-up, different levels, bosses and endings.Trivia External Links  Official Strikers 1945 site Strikers 1945 at KLOV.com Detailed Strikers 1945 info Strikers 1945 at MobyGamesStrikers 1945 II  Strikers 1945 II is a vertically scrolling shoot 'em up released in 1997 by Japanese company Psikyo. This game was also ported to the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn. An Android and iOS port was also released.Content Story  Winter, 1945 A.D. The ashes of WWII have not yet cooled when a secret organization known only as CANY opposed the Potsdam Declaration and attempted a coup to revive militarism. Their effort failed, but to a battle-weary population, it seemed a new shadow had spread across the world. Meanwhile, a similar threat, code named: \"F.G.R.\" successfully stole top secret Department of National Defense files covering new ammunition data. By using the information provided by their spy network, the F.G.R. will do their best to return the world to the chaos and upheaval of global warfare. Upon learning of this situation, the Strikers, christened as saviors of the world, are once again called into action.Gameplay  The player chooses one of 6 WWII-era fighter craft and shoots through eight stages (the first four levels are randomly chosen, and the last four remain the same each play). Once the game is beaten, a report showing how well the player did is displayed, and the game 'loops' with the difficulty much higher. Each game (on default settings) begins with three lives, and an extend is earned at 600,000. When all lives are lost, the option to continue is given but the score is reset. On levels 5 and higher in the console ports however, the stage restarts from the beginning if the player loses all of his/her lives. In the Android version, the score is carried on; however, the player must pay gold coins or rubies for each subsequent continues.Aircraft  In the Android version, only the Lightning and Shinden are available by default. Every other plane costs 400 rubies to unlock, and opting for a random choice costs 1000 gold coins. Watching an ad will unlock the locked plane for one use only.Basics  Each plane in Strikers 1945 II has three attacks: Normal shot (Tap the A button): A spray of bullets that can be strengthened by collecting power-ups. In the Android version, this is done automatically. Charge shot (Hold the A button until a sound is heard, then release): An attack that varies for each ship and is based upon a charge meter. The meter is composed of four levels ranging from empty to Level 3. The more the meter is filled, the greater the potency of the attack. In the Android version, this is done upon tapping the charge shot button. Bomb (Press the B button): An attack that varies for each ship, the bomb calls support craft to aid the player. They help block enemy bullets and also give support fire. In the Android version, this is done by tapping the bomb button, and any subsequent bombs when out of free bombs will cost you 300 gold coins, 500 gold coins, and 5 rubies, respectively.Items Power-ups  Power-ups are released by shooting certain enemies in Strikers 1945 II, mainly red ones. When a power-up is collected, the player's normal shot becomes more powerful and a secondary shot (such as homing missiles) may become available. Up to four power-ups can be collected, any after that are worth 4000 points. It is possible to power-down at any time by colliding with any enemy craft.Bombs  At the beginning of the game, the player has a stock of two bombs. By destroying certain enemy craft, usually larger ones, a bomb icon will be released and bounce around the screen. When collected, another bomb will be added to the player's stock. A total of nine can be collected, any other icons will reward the player with 10000 points.Gold bars  Gold bars can be found by destroying certain buildings or enemies and are collected for points. Each bar flashes white for short span of time, and if the player collects the bar while it is flashing it is worth more points. Points range from 200, 500, 1000, and 2000.Stages and Bosses  Like it's predecessor, Strikers 1945, the first 4 stages are in random order, whereas stages 5-8 are in proper order. Stage 1 to 4 (random):\n -N68.8, W57.9 (North Pole): North Atlantic Ocean; Davis Strait; between Greenland and Baffin Island, Nunavut, Canada\n Mid boss: Nagato (Battleship)\n Boss: Graf Zeppelin (Aircraft carrier/skull face robot) -N31.5, E128.9 (Japan): East China Sea, Uji Archipelago\n Mid boss: Messerschmitt Me 323 Gigant (Transport airplane)\n Boss: Syumi Type-0 (Flying boat/flying Cyclops robot) -N44.9, E6.2 (France): Rh\u00f4ne-Alp\n Mid boss: 15 defense turrets\n Boss: Iron Casket (Airship/flying emperor robot) -N36.3, W112.5 (United States of America): Grand Canyon\n Boss: Gliath (Armored train/desert robot) Stage 5: S22.4, E18.3 (Namibia): Kalahari Desert\n Mid boss: Landkreuzer P. 1000 Ratte (Heavy duty tank)\n Boss: Rommel (Turret fortress/scorpion tank) Stage 6: S7.5, W62.4 (Brazil): Madeira Dam\n Mid boss: Karl-Ger\u00e4t (Automatic mortar)\n Boss: Cross Sinker (Submarine/water robot) Stage 7: S7.5, W62.4 (Brazil): C.A.N.Y.

Headquarters\n Mid Boss: B.B. Karen (Prototype defense mechanism)\n Boss: F.G.R. (Mechanical tentacle alien/mechanical insectoid alien/base's core)Trivia External Links  Strikers 1945 II at KLOV.comP-38 Lightning  The P-38 Lightning is a recurring WWII-era fighter in the first two Strikers games, Strikers 1945 and Strikers 1945 II, as well as Strikers 1945 Plus. It is the standard ship of the series, with balanced attacks.Details Specifications Extra Information Trivia X-36 Warlord  The X-36 is a hidden fighter in Strikers 1945 III that can be unlocked by a certain dipswitch as a code 1999. Similar to the Flying Pancake, it has the same Homing lasers as the sub weapon. It has moderate speed, powerful damage, and the bomb it uses transforms it into its robot form, the Warlord, that throws a blue sphere bomb that can be controlled while throwing it. The Supershot has it shoot a ray beam straight at its opponent, with its Level 3 shooting ray beams in 3 ways.Details Specifications  Specifications are based on the real-life aircraft.Trivia Strikers 1945 Plus  Strikers 1945 Plus is a shoot 'em up for the Neo Geo MVS arcade System created by Psikyo. A small number of unauthorized home conversions were made by the company\u00a0!Arcade!. This game is a remix of Strikers 1945 Part 1 and 2 on a horizontal screen.Story  Winter, 1945 A.D. The fierce fight against CANY was but a militarist coup d'\u00e9tat to oppose the Potsdam Declaration. The threat brought by CANY brought a dark shadow throughout the world. Meanwhile, new weapons data from the US Department of Defense has been stolen, and was used to drag the world into chaos once again. The culprit: A new organization, codenamed \"F.G.R.\" Upon learning of this situation, the Strikers, appointed as a new weapons development experiment unit, are summoned once again to save the world.Gameplay  After inserting quarters and hitting the Start button, the player chooses one of 6 planes (plus 1 hidden plane) or can opt for a random choice. The available fighters are: The first four stages are in random order, while the last four are sequential. Players collect weapon powerups, bombs, and gold bars for points. Each plane has a unique \"supershot\" which is charged by damaging enemies and fired by holding then releasing the fire button. Supershots can be stored, although the number varies from plane to plane. Using a Bomb results in a large friendly fighter or bomber swooping onto the screen and blocking shots while returning fire for a few seconds. After the player beats the final boss, the game starts again from the beginning, albeit at a much higher difficulty level. All level are similar to the ones in Strikers 1945 II. Only one of the four bosses that are randomly chosen and the 6th boss is changed.PSP Edition  Gamewave magazine on December 25, 2008 has confirmed that Strikers 1945 Plus will get a PlayStation Portable release for February 2009. PM Studios, the publishers of DJ Max Fever, published the game as a downloadable game on July 30, 2009 in the US.Trivia External links Fighters  Recurring fighters in the Strikers 1945 series.

They are an easy way to earn fuel, and also go towards three achievements. You get the FUEL added to your total when you crash or nudge into them. They are not collected or picked up; just hitting them is enough. (For the four-stack, you don't have to ram each barrel; just touching one in the stack will net you the full 400 FUEL). . The best way to find them is to travel off road as they will be randomly placed in the fields or between trees in the forests. You can also find them on the roofs of buildings where they can be tricky to get (look for handy jumps and ramps). Multiple FUEL barrels can often be found in the same area. Tip: These FUEL Barrels respawn endlessly, so you can save time and nerves by not trying to pick up the more difficult to get-at barrels, simply look for others elsewhere. In close proximity of a few heliports more than 1000 FUEL can be collected, so you could visit those a few times, should you be pressed for FUEL.Dustbowl City Bonus Cars Trivia  This is the only urban area that is drive-able, and is usually unlocked mid to late game.The White Flats Career Down to the Flats Burnt Rubber Last Call for Passengers Vista Points Liveries Bonus Cars Trivia Vehicle  Vehicle images for FUEL.FUEL Wiki  Images used for in the wiki directly.Dead Lady's Lake Career Chasing the Lady's Ghost Peaks and Water Highway to the Lake  The race starts off on a short dirt section, drive off the edge instead of turning right for a shortcut jump over a corner onto tarmac and to the first checkpoint.

Super Meat Boy is a game franchise created and developed by Team Meat. The latest game - Super Meat Boy Forever - is scheduled to release in 2018 for multiple platforms including PS4, XB1, PC, and mobile.

We are currently editing over 201 articles, and 426 files, and you can help!Unlockable Characters  Super Meat Boy has unlockable characters that can be obtained, provided the player either beats a character specific warp zone or collects enough Bandages. The XBLA/PS4/Vita/Wii U and Steam versions have different characters, but most have similar abilities (Gish and Headcrab are very similar, and Bandage Girl and Brownie plays the same as Meat Boy). Some characters require a code to be typed on the character select screen. Once the code is typed, just select the character who is currently selected. The code must be typed every time you want to play as that character. Each character represents a different indie title (with the exception of Headcrab, Brownie, Potato Boy, and Meat Ninja). Below are all the unlockable characters and which games they originated from: *Meat Boy has unlockable versions of himself at 40, 60, and 80 Bandages and are available in all versions.Trivia Tofu Boy  Tofu Boy is a PC/Mac/Linux exclusive joke character originating from PETA's parody of Super Meat Boy, called Super Tofu Boy. Tofu Boy has an inflated ego, and is not actually as effective as he thinks he is. With the lowest speed and jumping height of all characters due to a \"major iron deficiency\", Tofu Boy is virtually useless. He is incapable of beating almost all levels, even being incapable of completing the first level without the use of the alt glitch. However, completing any level always awards the player an A+ no matter how much time it takes. Tofu Boy was added as a playable character on December 8th, 2010. He can be playable by typing \"petaphile\" in the character selection screen, then selecting any character at the character select screen. Typing in the code for Tofu Boy awards the player with the \"Well look at you!\" achievement. This achievement is only available in the Steam version and Ultra Edition of the game.Brownie  Brownie is the boss of The Salt Factory and the deuteragonist of Super Meat Boy. He has been designed to look like Meat Boy, but instead of being made of muscle with black eyes, he is made of Dr. Fetus' feces and has yellow eyes, most likely made of corn. His boss fight acts like a speed run through a level that has rising salt. Making contact with him will not kill Meat Boy. After beating Brownie, Meat Boy will try and save him, but fails as Dr. Fetus keeps pelting him with bricks, as an attempt for revenge, Meat Boy jumps over to Dr. Fetus's tower, but later gets hit with a remote, sending him to the the salt flood below, unlocking Chapter 4: Hell. Brownie appears once again after beating Dr. Fetus and escaping from \"his castle\". As a boulder is just about to crush Meat Boy, Brownie comes to save him. He is thought to have died as he went down with the island as it was exploding. However, he appears during the credits popping out from his grave and then getting hit by a toilet that comes from Dr. Fetus' castle. The song that is played in this level is called \"Fast Track to Browntown\".Cutscene  Before the battle begins, Meat Boy found Bandage Girl tied in the factory and attempts to rescue her. However, Meat Boy's rescue is interrupted by Dr. Fetus, who is using a toilet. He then flushes the toilet (without wiping) creating the poo creature known as Brownie. The poo creature appears and roars at Meat Boy, only to be interrupted by a fart from Dr. Fetus who, after spending time on the toilet, presses a button which floods the area with a rising pile of salt. The battle begins.As a Playable Character  Brownie is also available as a playable character in all versions of the game via a code. He is a re-skin of Meat Boy. To play as Brownie, you must have defeated The Salt Factory boss and input the following code in the character select screen: Brownie is available on PC/Mac/Linux, but a controller is necessary to input the code. After entering the code, a voice should say \"Push the buttons!\" Then choose any character, and you will be playing as Brownie. Example of the code working can be found here.Trivia Dr. Fetus  Dr. Fetus is the main antagonist of the game. Made obvious by his name, he is a small fetus in a jar and the main villain of Super Meat Boy who mostly spends his days trolling the internet. For some odd reason, nobody likes him and he doesn't like them, either. It is common for Dr. Fetus to flip off Meat Boy. This can be seen in the transition from the light and dark world, pause menu, and some cut scenes. In the beginning cutscene it is shown that he hates YOU, most likely because he knows you are helping Meat Boy. So, he flips off you also. He beats up Meat Boy and kidnaps Bandage Girl, which means Meat Boy needs to save her. When Meat Boy catches up to Bandage Girl, it only ends up with Dr. Fetus kidnapping Bandage Girl and teleporting elsewhere.Developer Mode  Through the use of developer mode a player can choose to play as Dr. Fetus. He features the special ability of throwing missiles and has the same movement as Meat Boy. It should be noted that, in the manual that comes with the Ultra Edition of Super Meat Boy, there are diary entries that say \"Keith Fetus 8.14.96.\" It is possible that Keith may be the first name of Dr. Fetus. His Twitter account also shows his name as Keith Fetus. Dr. Fetus makes an appearance in Super Tofu Boy, PETA's parody of SMB, where he is seen confessing to Bandage Girl and Tofu Boy that he put hormones on Meat Boy so he could act so violently.Plan  As shown in a few comics, Dr. Fetus fiercely hates Meat Boy and kidnaps Bandage Girl to lure him through extremely dangerous paths.Boss Battle  His boss battle first starts with Dr. Fetus trying to hit the player with a homing rocket launcher. The player must run from Dr. Fetus, avoiding the plethora of saws, pits, Dr. Fetus' missiles, and the 2 saw \"columns\" hanging from what we can assume is the top of the \"castle\" that Dr. Fetus controls, that kill you if you wait around for long enough on any area of this section of the battle. Then the player is trapped in a room with Dr. Fetus. There is a switch at the top of the ceiling. The player must dodge the missiles shot from Dr. Fetus and hit the button. Then the player must run into another room and the floor will collapse, resulting in Dr. Fetus falling into a pit. When he lands, his glass jar will break, revealing his body completely. As he rolls around in pain and you finally reunite with Bandage Girl, he will press a button, causing his \"castle\" to start falling apart. Then the player must go all the way back through the level (although with some notable tweaks, such as black smoke and a lot of shaking, making the escape arguably just as hard, though the saw columns \"magically disappear\" in a way that's never really explained after you reach the end of the first half) with Bandage Girl piggyback riding you (this does NOT affect your movement) and survive to beat the boss.As a Playable Character  Since Dr. Fetus wasn't intended to be a playable character, he isn't playable via normal means. However, he can still be played, and there are two ways of doing so: Devmode: Dr. Fetus can be played in developer mode. This isn't very useful if you want to play him in the normal game, though. Glitch abuse: Dr. Fetus can be played in the normal game through a glitch called bandage duplication. An explanation to the glitch can be found here (read description), and is only possible on the PC version of the game. After unlocking him, he is invincible to every obstacle and can only die by falling out of the world.Trivia Steve (Mr.Minecraft)  Steve is the main character of the internet-famous online game called Minecraft. He is the last character you unlock after you collect all 100 bandages in the PC/Mac/Linux version of the game. His ability allows you to remove and place blocks at free will, therefore making almost any level very easy. Age:\u00a0??? Con: No running. This makes him useless in some Rapture levels like \"Rise\" (If you want A+). Also if you want an achievement of completing a world without dying, you can't use him. Requirements: 100 bandages Achievement: \"Accidental Arsonist\"Trivia Chapter 1: The Forest  The Forest is the first world in Super Meat Boy. Due to being the first world, it is fairly straightforward to pass through and is by far the easiest world in both the Dark and Light versions of each level. The first three levels are tutorial-like and familiarize the player with the controls. The Dark World of The Forest is about the same difficulty as Chapter 2: The Hospital's light world. After beating at least 17 levels, the boss of this world is unlocked, called Lil' Slugger. Dr. Fetus uses a large vehicle with a chainsaw on the front to try and kill Meat Boy. All Meat Boy has to do is reach the end of the level while dodging the saws and staying ahead of Dr. Fetus. Sprinting is required to stay ahead of him to reach the goal. Once he makes it to safety, Lil' Slugger will break down and the boss level is over; Chapter 2 will be unlocked. The music for Chapter 1 is as follows: \"Forest Funk\" for the Light World, \"Ballad of the Burning Squirrel\" for the Dark World and \"The Battle of Lil' Slugger\" for the boss.Levels (Light World) Levels (Dark World) Trivia The Kid  The Kid is the protagonist of I Wanna Be The Guy. He becomes a playable character if you are able to complete his warp zone. Like Ogmo, he has the ability to double jump, but has better vertical reach. He is better than Ogmo overall, but Ogmo is better if you want more of a challenge. Unlocking him will unlock the achievement \"The Kid\" for the Xbox 360 (10 Gamerscore Points), PS4/Psvita (Silver Trophy), and the Steam version. The first level of his warp zone was altered and added to the \"Expert Remix\" chapter on Teh Internets, a chapter that consisted of previous levels, but made exceptionally hard. The only character available in this is Meat Boy. In a poll on the Super Meat Boy forums, The Kid was voted as the most favorite guest character, obtaining just over a third (41) of the 120 votes. The Kid got over 3 times as many votes as second place Captain Viridian (12 votes) Location: 5-7 \"The Fallen\" Age: 15 (According to his game) Pros: double jump (better than Ogmo's) and better speed than Ogmo's but worse than Meat Boy's Cons: very difficult to unlockCaptain Viridian  Captain Viridian, misspelled in Super Meat Boy as \"Capitan Viridian\", is from the indie platformer VVVVVV. He's an unlockable character for the PC/Mac/Linux versions of the game. The requirement to unlock him is to obtain 90 bandages. He has the ability to flip gravity, but only when he is on stable, horizontal ground. This can make it easy for him to travel long, vertical, corridor-like levels such as 3-6 (The Shaft). Age:\u00a0??? Con: Can't run very fast and has no control over the height of jumps when gravity is flipped. Achievement: \"Vx6\" Description: \"VVVVVV VVVVVV\"Pink Knight  The Pink Knight is the character from Castle Crashers. He is exclusive to the XBLA, PS4/PSVita and Wii U versions of the game. He can do an \"Air-Flutter\" similar to Yoshi from the Mario series and can jump regularly and in the air. His Air-Flutter gives his jump better horizontal and vertical distance, but his jump is a bit short, making him a bit useless in wall jumping levels. He is basically the the console version of Josef.Origin  The Pink Knight in this game, is indeed from Castle Crashers, the XBLA game by Tom Fulp & Dan Paladin. However, the Pink Knight has its roots from Castle Crashing the Beard , a flash game by BomToons, Coaly & Luis. It was made back in 2008, a parody of the creator of Castle Crashers, Tom Fulp, because he stated that he would not shave his beard until the game was complete. The game was also nominated for the 2008 Newgrounds Tank Awards! In Castle Crashing the Beard , Pink Knight appears when you Max Out on Level Up, and reach the FAB Level. That's when you gain 950 XP! He uses a Lollipop as his weapon, and rainbow trails appear as he swings it. His other special in the game, is to shoot bubbles from his weapon. Pink Knight is the 5th Level in Castle Crashing the Beard, meaning that there are 4 more levels that precedes the FAB level, with different abilites and special powers!Jill  Jill is the main character of Mighty Jill Off. She is also an unlockable character for the Steam, Xbox 360, Wii U, and Nintendo Switch versions of the Super Meat Boy. Her warp zone (named \"The Bootlicker!\") can be found in world 2-8. By pressing the jump button rapidly in mid-air, Jill can float and fall much slower. This is a similar mechanic in Super Mario Bros. 3 with the Raccon Leaf powerup. However, her speed is a bit low, making her not as useful for speed run levels. Con: Low running speed Description: \"Air Brakes! Pervert\"Meat Boy (character)  Meat Boy is the main protagonist of Super Meat Boy. He is a skinless boy in the shape of a cube who is in a relationship with Bandage Girl. He not only loves Bandage Girl, but, because of his lack of skin, needs her to stay alive. Thus, when she is captured by Dr. Fetus, he must rescue her.Gameplay  Although he has no special abilities, he has one of the fastest movement speeds in the game, along with RunMan and the Ninja. This makes him effective in speedruns and generally completing levels quickly. He is also one of the only characters in the game who is able to complete every level. He leaves blood behind him as he runs, which stays there even after he dies and can be used to view failed strategies, and is the only playable character in boss battles.Trivia Audio  The sound that Meat Boy and Gish make when respawning after dying.Alien Hominid  Alien Hominid is a character from The Behemoth's game Alien Hominid. He also appears in The Behemoth's game Castle Crashers. Alien Hominid can be unlocked with 30 bandages. He can shoot to boost his jumps or lengthen falls. This makes him jump higher than any other character. However, his regular jump isn't that high. He is like Jill and the Pink Knight combined, except that he can't jump regularly in the air. Alien Hominid was Xbox 360 exclusive until he was released in the PC version of Super Meat Boy with the Ultra edition. He is unlocked by collecting 30 bandages in the PC version, along with Josef from Machinarium. He also appears in Meat Boy. Age: 1 Con: Jumping height is lower Description: \"Illegal\"Ogmo   Ogmo is a character from Matt Thorson's platformer, Jumper. Ogmo is a failed experiment. He can be unlocked in 3-16 Mono. Ogmo can double jump, but his normal jump is short and slow. Each jump he does also has an 8-bit style sound effect to it, similar to the one Meat Boy has whenever he's in a warp zone. Gender: Male Age:\u00a0??? Warp Zone Location: The Salt Factory: Level 3-16 \"Mono\" Con: Has the second-lowest jump of all characters in Super Meat Boy, after Tofu Boy Description: \"Double Jump! Ripoff!\"Warp Zone  Ogmo's warp zone can be found on the level 3-16 Mono by waiting in the beginning of the level untill the warp zone appears.Trivia RunMan  RunMan is a character from RunMan: Race Around The World. He can be unlocked with 70 bandages in the PC version. RunMan has the ability to run extremely fast, and even faster when holding down the run button. But, unlike his own game, he doesn't automatically bounce (or ricochet) off walls while holding Shift. RunMan is one of the characters that has an equivalent character on the XBLA version, The Ninja. While both of them have a Super Dash, or Star Dive for RunMan, RunMan doesn't receive the special aerial and running attributes The Ninja gets, but Runman has his own: by Dash Jumping. This occurs when RunMan Star Dives and jumps at the same time, and the jump spans incredible lengths. RunMan is also one of the few characters that conserves characteristics from his\u00a0games: he keeps his trails when he dashes. It can also be noted that RunMan has many similarities to Starfy (from the Legendary Starfy series). RunMan is an excellent speedrun character, due to his running speed. He does have his weak points, such as a poor jumping height. This can cause some problems if you accidentally land near a spike: his jump could not be enough to recover from it. You will, but that would actually delay you. As for that, the technique Dash Jumping can come handy in some situations. Cons: The Star Dive can only be used for a short period of time, and he has a low jump height.Bandage Girl  Bandage Girl is the \"Damsel in Distress\" character of the game, who loves Meat Boy and keeps getting kidnapped by Dr. Fetus. In the original Meat Boy flash game, she was known as \"Band-Aid Girl\"; her name was changed to avoid legal repercussions.\u00a0 Once the boss in a chapter is completed, she can have a small chance of being \"glitched\" with a distorted appearance and making strange beeping sounds. Touching her while in this form will activate the Glitch Level for that chapter.\u00a0As a Playable Character  She is the playable character in Chapter 7: The Cotton Alley. In The Cotton Alley, Bandage Girl (who leaves behind a pink trail of calamine lotion) must rescue Meat Boy. She handles identically to her boyfriend. As a playable character, she has a flower on her head. She is a re-skin of meat boy.Josef  Josef is the main character of Machinarium. He's a playable character in the PC version of the game and can be unlocked by collecting 30 bandages. Josef also tends to stick to walls. Repeated wall jumps allow Josef to maneuver in hard to reach spots or to skip certain parts of a level. In a poll on the Super Meat Boy forums, Josef was voted as the worst character in either version of the game. Out of 125 votes, Josef got 29 votes (23.2%), nearly double of the character in second place (Headcrab got 15 votes).Flywrench  Flywrench is a warp zone unlockable character, and the titular main character of Flywrench. Flywrench is a very odd character. Instead of walljumping, pressing the jump button while Flywrench is hugging a wall will have Flywrench move vertically up the wall. This can be useful in levels that involve jumping up towers or corner hugging. Also, in addition to his main jump, Flywrench can make two more small jumps in mid air. However, he falls faster than any other character and, although he has access to a triple jump, each jump is weaker than the previous one.Info  Location: 4-18 \"Boris\" Age: N/A Cons: Very Heavy, difficult to use and master Achievement: The Fly Guy Description: Triple Jump! Heavy!Tim  Tim is the protagonist of indie title Braid, a game available on Xbox Live Arcade and Steam. He's an unlockable character for the XBLA, PS4/PSVita and Wii U/Switch versions of Super Meat Boy by collecting 50 bandages. You can also play as tim in the PC/Steam version of the game. In the character select screen, just type \"outtatime\" and choose any character. (You won't hear \"Push the buttons!\" but it still works.) He has the ability to rewind time 3 seconds. This can be used for Bandages as once one is obtained, rewinding time will not make it appear again. He cannot rewind time however if he dies, and he also cannot run. Unlocking him in the Xbox 360 version will get the achievement \"Business Time\". You can also use Tim to kill the Burnt Boy (Zombie Meat Boy) and Oob enemies from Rapture by getting hit by them while rewinding. However, Oob enemies will freeze and can still kill you if you touch him. Some bandages are also nearly impossible to get without him or a character that can double jump Con: Tim can't run (But he is pretty fast on his own.)Bugs  If you use his rewind time ability at the right moment when you die, The timer will stay at zero, but he will be floating in the air. If you manage to get to a platform in this state, You can complete the level with a time of 0.00. If you rewind time and hold The sprint button at the beginning of the level, He will repeat the spawn anmation and the sound will play too. This will end as soon as you stop holding the sprint button. Tim can be used to clip through moving platforms or appearing and disappearing Platforms and walls, but letting go of the sprint button will immediately warp you out of the platform.Gish  Gish is a ball of tar from the 2D platforming game named after him (Gish). Similarly to Meat Boy, Gish lives happily with his girlfriend until a mysterious figure kidnaps her. Both characters were created by Edmund McMillen. Gish can be unlocked with 10 bandages. Gish can stick to walls or slide on ceilings, but is slow and has bad speed control. Gish is similar to Headcrab but has a more vertical jump and a less horizontal jump. He is only in the XBLA, PS4/PSVita and Wii U versions of the game.Trivia References Headcrab  The Headcrab is the 10 Bandages unlock for the Steam Version of Super Meat Boy. Headcrab is like Goo Ball, but with a more horizontal jump. Con: Jumps less vertically than Gish and Gooball Description: \"Clingy! Itchy\"Trivia Goo Ball  Goo Ball is a Steam-exclusive character in Super Meat Boy. It is unlocked by typing in \"ballgoo\" in the character select screen and selecting a character. It is basically a Steam version of Gish, which is exclusive to the XBLA, PS4/PSVita and Wii U versions of the game. He acts just like Headcrab. He sticks to walls and slides on ceilings when holding the run button. He is a character from another indie game, World of Goo.Spelunky  Spelunky is the main character of Spelunky. He's an unlockable character for the XBLA, PS4/PSVita, Wii U and Switch versions of the game. You unlock him when you get 70 bandages. He can fly farther distances using explosives to launch him a far distance. He can also jump regularly in the air. However, his jump is short, making him a bad character for wall jumping levels.Naija  Naija is the main character of the indie game Aquaria. She's an unlockable character for the PC/Mac/Linux versions of the game for collecting 50 bandages. By holding Special (Shift on keyboard) in mid-air, Naija will float very slowly. Upon releasing Shift, Naija will dash upward extremely fast. However, her jump is short, making her not as useful for wall jumping levels. She is somewhat similar to\u00a0Spelunky, except that she can't dash downwards. She also doesn't fly as far as Spelunky, and her movement on land is very slippery, meaning she will slide uncontrollably for a moment when she changes direction. If the game lags when Naija dashes near the corner of a wall, there is chance she will clip right through it. It's most often caused by lag, but there are certain levels in the game where she can go through walls without any frame drops. Example of the exploit can be found here.", "The Pip-boy Wiki": "The Pip-boy Wiki The Pip-Boy: Fallout Fanon Wiki The Great War  The Great War started and ended on Saturday, October 23, 2077 when nuclear weapons were launched by all the nuclear-capable nations of the world (mainly from the United States, China and the USSR ). The exchange lasted for approximately two hours, according to most survivors' accounts. Once the last atomic bomb and nuclear warhead had fallen, the world fell into the deep darkness of a nuclear holocaust.The Begining.  By the year 2050 fossil fuel were becoming in short supply around the globe due to inventors refusing to create machines that would be more fuel efficant. Many conflicts around the world sprang up in an all out war for the all the fuel that remained. In the year 2053, war began when the USSR invaded the Middle East who controlled 70% of the remaining fuel in the world. Within a week the USSR had taken complet control of the Middle East mainly due to the their first power armor corps, which made quick work of any solder standing in their way. A week after the USSR's invaision of the middle east, the Commonwealth of Euroupe moved sevarel divisions into the middle east in the guise of liberating the newly counqured citezens of the Middle East. The war between the USSR and the Commonwealth of Euroupe roared for several years. While the war for fuel raged in the Middle East, America seemed untouched by the conflict until December 1st of 2058 when the first waves of the Chinese army invade Califronia and Alaska. The California assualt was only a distraction while the main army attacked the Anchorage base in the hopes to steal the numerous oil fields in lush state. It took the American forces to defeat the California assualt force in a matter of days. However by the time the U.S. and learned that California was mearly a distraction to draw attention from the invasion of Alsaka it was to late, the small army there was already defeated and the Chinese had became deeply entreched in the wilds of Alaska. The war to retake Alaska last for over a year before the American armies were finnaly able to force the Chinese solders to retreat from their posts throughout of Alsaka to the base in Ancorage. Operation Ancorage began in November 15th in the year 2059 and ended in April 22th 2060. Well Confilct Waged in the North, the Venzuala Union in the year 2060 had gathered all oil refineries in South America and slowly were moving up to Mexico well at the same time launching and assualt on the African Alliance, of Africa, who had little oil but a large supply of quantiam It was June 18th of 2060, when America absorbed Canada into their country with the hope that if Alaska was invaded agian, Canada would have no choice but to help in it's defense. One June 20th of 2060 America launched a counter assualt on the Chinese Main Land. The assualt force consisted primarly of the 22nd division of elite power armor solders using HB-22 armor. Mexico on the verge of being defeated by the Venzuala Union begged the United States of America for Protection. A week after pleading for aid, Mexico signed a treaty joining the United State of America and Mexico together on November 13th 2060 and along with Canada formed the North American Protection Alliance. With the arrival of American forces, the Venzuala Union not wishing a conflict with America withdrew from Mexico on November 29th 2060. After withdrawing from Mexico the Venzuala Union was able to focus the full front of their force on conquring Africa. At the Battle of Fire Ridge on January 3rd 2062, the Venzuala Union set a descive blow agianst the African Alliance and in the process took several mines containing high amounts of quantiam. The remants of the African Alliance regrouped their forces in Northern Africa and began to prepare for a counter assualt. Fearing that they would inevitablely be defeted by the Venezuelan Union, they sent word to the United States asking for aid. The United States was already in the midst of a bloddy war with China and Congress refused to aid the North African Alliance fearing that unlike with Mexico that the Venezeulan Union would refuse to back down forcing them to fight two wars at once. The African Alliance, after being turned down by the U.S.A made a deal to give the Commonwealth of Europe a large amount of quantiam in exchange for portection. The Commonwealth of Europe aggreed to this arangement and sent 50,000 solders to help protect African alliance protect the borders of its remaining territories. On May 19th of 2063 the USSR was forced to pull out of the Middle East after suffering a utter defeat at the Battle of Kawait. On June 20th of 2063 the Commonwealth of Europe, just having obtained the Middle East, sent a large army to aid the African Alliance in their campaign to retake Africa in exchange for 40% of the African contentent when the Venezualan army finaly had been defeated. On August 1st or 2063, the USSR fearing that the CommonWealth of Europe was becoming to powerful sent powerful weapons and powerarmor to aid the Venzualan army. At first the the combined forces of the African Alliance and the CommonWealth of Europe started to win the war with over a dozen victories under their belt agianst the Venzualan army. However, with the arrival of USSR supplies the Venzuelan army began to hold their own against their larger opponet. On July 2nd, 2065 the U.S.A army won a major victory against the Chinese army at the Battle of NanJing City. Australia seperated itself from the Commonwealth of Europe on Febuary 29th 2066 after finding a large amount of oil off their coast and in the outback. Immediatly two days after Australia seceded from the Commonwealth, an army invaded Australia and began a campaign to bring them once agian under the fold. The Australian army put up a heavy resistance and kept the enemy entrenched ten miles from the beach where they had landed. The USSR seeing that the Commonwealth was busy fighting two wars made a move once agian for the Middle East. After a month of heavy fighting the Commonwealth was defeated and forced to flee from the Middle East. Like the USSR, the Venzualan army saw that the Commonwealth was in trouble and a week after the USSR invaded the Middle East, they lead a massive counter attack winning a descive victory at the battle of Little Creek. The Common wealth had no choice but to halt their invaision of Africa and move to a protection role once more. On May 18th 2066 after recieving weapons and armor from the USSR the Australian army lead an assualt on the attacking CommonWealth troops and completly pushed them out the Island. The battle was given the name Bloody sands as account of the number of Commonwealth causalities. On January 16th 2067 the USSR sent eight divisions of their expert power armor troops into the Commonwealth of Europe. As the Venzualans had aggreed to attack the Commonwealth forces still in Africa, they did so and won several victories accross Northern Africa. The Commonwealth forces had no choice to leave the country of Africa leaving the African Alliance to fend for themselves. Stilling having one decent quantaim mine under their control the African Alliance sold it to America for power armor and supplies. Using the American power armor which was far more advanced than the Venzualans old USSR armor they were not only able to hold their own but slowly most of Northern Africa and parts of Central Africa. The Commonwealth on the verge of being destoryed asked for U.S aid, which was granted and implemented on April, 14th 2067. The U.S. sent sevarl divisions into Soviet Russia to draw attention away from Europe. On June 19th 2067, Venzualan Union angry at America for aiding the African Alliance and fighting agianst there biggest supportors, the USSR, they launched a surprise invasion of Mexico. It took only a week for Vezuelan army to defat the surprised U.S forces and take over all of mexico. Three days after losing Mexico the U.S. sent an army into Mexico and after two days of fighting the Venzuelan army retreated out of Mexico after suffering heavy losses. On June 1st 2068 the U.S. sent an invasionary army into South America to steal what oil remained there. November 9th, 2069; The Chinese sent on thousand men in stealthsuits to attack Americia well the soviets sent a thousand men in the new Russian BS-ERK 19A powerarmor into Western America to lay waste. It took over a year for the U.S to completly wipe out the attacking armies which as enemy armies caused massive damage and desturction in the U.S and distracted the generals from their campaign in Russian in China. The U.S was routed in Russia and had to leave with their tail between their legs and they also suffred heavy losses in Chinese soil, though Congress refused the let the army retreat. The Venzuelan Union finnaly was able to stop the U.S. advance at the battle of Nooble Minefield. The Venzuelan victory was so devistating to the U.S and along with the damage they were taking at home from the Chines and Russian invasion, and losses in their Russian and China invasion, the U.S had no choice but to pull out of South America. On January 19th, 2070, The commonwealth were able to push the USSR out of Europe. Due to revolts which were eventually quelled throughtout the USSR. For the next seven years war raged throught the world effecting all of the powers except for Australia which had dubbed itself the fee nation after severing all ties with the USSR knowing that they would be unable to attack them unless they defeated the Common Wealth first. The USA countiued to push there troop deeper into China with their eyes set on destroying Beijing. The Venzuelan Union broke up in 2074 after a major revolt shook the foundaitions of their power. The African Alliance saw this as a chance to retake Africa and did so by the year 2076 however 3 months after winning back Afric the Alliance was split up when the individual African countries decided to retake control of their own countries. The Commonwealth sent an army to retake the Middle East from USSR control.The Great War two hours of hell.  The nuclear exchange that characterized the Great War lasted for only a brief two hours, but was unbelievably destructive and reshaped the climate of the world even as it caused the fall of most of human civilization everywhere across the globe. More energy was released in the first moments of the Great War than all of the previous human conflicts in the history of the world combined. In the United States, the West Coast was hit first by Chinese strategic bombers and ballistic missiles, and as a consequence on the East Coast (which was struck at about 10:47) more people were able to get into the vaults and personal protection shelters, leading to a higher initial survival rate. In the two hours of nuclear fire, the geography and climate of the Earth was changed significantly. Entire mountain ranges were created as the ground buckled and moved under the strain of the cataclysmic pressure produced by numerous, concentrated atomic explosions. Rivers and oceans around the world were contaminated with the resulting radioactive fallout released by the relatively low-yield nuclear weapons used by all sides, and the climate changed horrifically. All the regions of the Earth, suffered from a single, permanent season once the initial dust blasted into the atmosphere by the nuclear explosions had settled - a scorching, radioactive desert summer.Fat Shizzle  Fat Shizzle, or Big Fat McFatfat is a ninja warrior, although he weighs over 500 pounds. He is known across the entire world as a dual laser-katana wielding raider, and has chopped off over a trillion of Enclave heads. How does he not run out of Enclave soldiers, you ask? Well, because of the great invention called the ' Enclave Dispenser 2.0.', which is programmed to spout out soldiers, Vertibirds and Rad-Away biscuits. Nowadays, Fat Shizzle can be seen when either hiking over the Himalayas or flying around as a chopper gunner in the Sahara desert. When not at work, he enjoys sunbathing, sunbathing, sleeping, and sunbathing.The Lemon of Destiny  The Lemon of Destiny wasa really good guy who was born a long time ago in a place called Vault 101.

Please edit this page to tell the community about yourself!My favorite pages Vault 11 Operational History Early History  The entire Vault has been plastered with propaganda for an election for a new Overseer. The election seems to be unusual in that each candidate is expressing outrage at having been nominated and trying to point out not only their innocence but why the other candidates deserve to be Overseer for their sins. Deeper in the vault it becomes clear there has been fighting, with barricades and some traps. At the conclusion of the term of an Overseer, they are required to enter a chamber below the Overseer's Office to offer their own life, otherwise the computer controlling the Vault will execute the entire population. The computer does not require that the sacrifice should be the Overseer; of the original residents, only the Overseer entered the Vault cognizant of the regular sacrifices that would be required to provide life and shelter for the remainder of the Vault's residents. The residents of the vault, in their shock and anger at the discovery after having already been sealed inside the vault, demanded that the sacrifice be chosen democratically, and, further, chose the Overseer (who they viewed as having betrayed them) as the first sacrifice. This would marry the positions of Overseer and Sacrifice until the end. In this Vault, several groups of voting blocs appeared to exercise power by means of their population and voting potential to exert force over other Vault residents. Prior to the final election, the most powerful of the voting blocs (the Justice Bloc) confronted Katherine Stone, threatening that, if she did not perform sexual favors for the members of their bloc, they would nominate her husband, Nathan Stone, for Overseer. Katherine, fearing for the fate of her husband, complied. Much to the shock of the Stone family, the Justice Bloc nominated Nathan for Overseer regardless, being the only Bloc to nominate him (it appears that it would be normal politics for several blocs to nominate a candidate due to the general moral outrage against a candidate). Fearing for the fate of her husband, Katherine decided that she had to save him using the only method she felt left available to her: she began to stalk and kill the members of the Justice Bloc. Upon her capture, she confessed to her crimes immediately, explaining not only her plan but also her reasoning. She was asked if the voters would be so easily swayed, and explained she felt she would win because the voters had to make a choice \"they could live with\" the guilt of electing. Katherine Stone's first act as Overseer, Overseer Order 745, dissolves the election process, instead decreeing that the position of Overseer will be chosen using the Vault's computer systems and a random number generator. The Justice Bloc, aghast that they were going to lose the ability to control Vault life by means of election threats, not only feared that one of their own members would be elected, but also worried that waiting for a member of their own Bloc to be randomly chosen as Overseer to be elected and thus be able to reverse the order may take so long that the dissolving Vault social structure would not place them on top when it re-formed. They decided to stage an armed coup to force Katherine to reverse Overseer Order 745. Below the Overseer's Office is a long tunnel leading to a room with a projector and a chair. Pleasant scenes are shown while a voice reassures the sacrifice that they lived a good life and their next one will be better yet. The door locks as soon as the projection starts, and when it's done, the walls open up to reveal two side rooms containing one Security Droid, six Turrets (three on each side, various versions), and three Mister Gutsy. It is also possible for the hostiles to be two sentry bots, one robobrain, and six Turrets (three on each side, versions still varying). The hostiles are most likely determined by the player's level. If defeated, the player can then access a small room with the vault mainframe computer inside. This computer unlocks the door and reveals that there were only 5 survivors of the vault when they chose to stop sending sacrifices. There is also a recording \"Automated solution response\" that is likely played when they refuse. It states that by not sending a sacrifice, they are \"a shining beacon to humanity\" and they will not be killed. They are also informed that the vault door is then unlocked so they can come and go as they please but are urged to consult with their Overseer before they do so. In conclusion, Vault 11, like every other part of the Vault Experiment, was nothing more than a social experiment testing human nature - most specifically the ability to sacrifice oneself for others, and the ability to place ideals above forcing that sacrifice on others. The Enclave was almost certainly pleased with the findings; the population immediately surrendered to the threat, eventually integrated it into their everyday lives, and even made sacrifices simply to preserve power cliques in the face of potentially positive change. Finally it resulted in a civil war that (we assume) left just 5 survivors, who finally refused to submit - and afterward chose to die rather than live with the consequences of their actions. All useful information for a group devoted to global domination such as the Enclave. As is presented by the first audiolog upon entry to the Vault, the fate of the final survivors is to commit suicide as a means of punishing themselves for the events that happened in the vault. This is not apparent the first time the player listens to the tape as \"I'll go first\" is interpreted as referring to exiting the vault. In the audiolog, there is an argument of five people: man, referred to as \"Voice 1\" tries to convince the other four (three males and a female) to leave the vault. As conversation moves on, it becomes clear, that they are the last vault survivors, that refused to \"sacrifice\" and found out the truth. Voices 2 (female), 3 (reffered as Henry), 4 and 5 decided to commit suicide when they found out about the vault's experiment, while \"Voice 1\" is having second thoughts, and tries to convince them to leave the vault and spread the word about what happened there. With a single gun, the plan was for a shooter to shoot the other four and then turn the gun to himself, however this is not how it played out. Only one question remains; there were five survivors when the experiment ended, five people who entered the suicide pact, but only four skeletons - and only a single gun - in the Vault's entrance room. The one who fired the shots that killed the others did not commit suicide himself as intended, but entered the wasteland. His identity and fate is as of yet, unknown.Later History  After a significant period of time the abandoned Vault was opened by the courier, its interior examined, its sacrificial chamber opened and its lock-down disengaged before it was once again sealed and left. Following this The vault was left for a period of two years, until its Vault door was once again opened by the Reclaimers -A group of salvagers- on the intent of restoring its primary sub-systems for their own use. During this period a small portion of its interior was restored and a number of critical subsystems repaired for minimal operation. By 2284 a small majority of systems that could be salvaged were brought online, alas the Main reactor would remain in a state of disrepair without the needed components. Over the next few months a small settlement was established inside its interior -yet nowhere near the capacity of the Vault itself- and a number of defences were built to defend it from raiders or any other threat. Overall the occupation of Vault 11 was intended to be a stop gap measure, its unmaintained machinery posing a number of issues that would result in trading links to be opened and restore their overall sustainability. Scout teams were soon dispatched to locate the various components that the Vault required to reach minimal operational level and allow for its continued use by the group. By 2285 this goal was reached and the Vault once again reach operational level, its primary mainframe deactivating various locks to its control system.Layout  The overall size of Vault 11 is like many, not as it appears with various doors leading to a number of expansive complexes that hold facilities that are required for settlement construction. These rooms are hidden behind large false walls that can be opened either by; exposing the small panel in the wall and opening it via a keypad or unlocking it via the Vault mainframe. The code in question is unlocked when the Vaults assigned task is completed. Following this various commands are given to the production equipment and as such give users a greater choice in what they can produce - as long as the required minerals are present for production- however this system needs a much more regular maintenance and is overall not recommended for a smaller population. A trio of mining droids are located in the very rear of one of these supply warehouses -behind a various supplies that are normally used during times that the vault has gone beyond what recycling can provide- These units can, if need be mine the local rock for minerals to either expand the vaults itself or an settlement that has been founded above it. In general these units should be considered an emergency option as they can cause local geological instability.Airlock  Like most East coast vaults, it retains the large entry level that joins into the Vaults clinic and a near-by class room. This Room has been refitted with a newer computer system that allows for remote opening via a wireless password authenticator controller. Other additions to this room include a trio of Mark III turrets and four Protectron units. The Vault Door itself has suffered minor damage via raiders -however not being damaged to an overall large extent- however the door opening mechanism has suffered a direct hit from a grenade launcher and as such is in dire need of repairs. Overall this area of the facility has been restored to the best of repair drones abilities, however without a steady supply of resources no further changes can be made.Male and Female dorms  Originally the Dorms were much larger and expansive than that of what it was currently, expanding down three levels in a grid iron pattern. This design feature was changed when the population continued to decrease and as such false walls were raised and as such sealed off the varying levels of this large complex. Since the lock down ended these rooms were once again exposed. Once these rooms were exposed some were quickly converted for other needs.Shivly Welcome  Hi, welcome to The Pip-boy Wiki!

My favorite thing to do for recreation is create my own video games for my non-exsistent video game console, the Play Pyramid. I have a very kind nature and try to be nice to other people and am also kind when I play video games. (as in, I like being a good character in Fallout instead of evil or nuetral, I am usually kind when talking to people over Xbox Live, unless they are really making me angry) I like to pretend to be other things I'm not, including pretending to be a spaz, some mentally insane guy, or an idiot, in an attempt to be funny. I usually try to be funny even though I rarely get other people to laugh. I really like Science Fiction, not much of a fantasy fan besides Harry Potter, and really enjoy video games and books. I want to work in the video game industry and/or be an author when I'm an adult. Oh yes, I also hate it when people don't use proper grammer, spelling, puncuation, capitalization, and so on. I also hate text, and try to avoid using things like lol, rofl, text faces, brb and so on. I only rarely use lol to show that I laughed which I cannot express in what I'm writing and a face to show my emotion at the time if it calls for it. Otherwise if I use those kind of things it is for comedic effect.Creations Creatures Under Construction Writers92 Fallout World.

Includes stage appearances as well as in-text cameos.The King of Fighters XIII  The King of Fighters XIII is the thirteenth installment in The King of Fighters series and the final chapter of \"Tales of Ash\" Saga, started in The King of Fighters 2003. The theme for this title is \"KOF-ism\" or getting back to the heart of the series. The main objective of the game's new features is to appeal to the audience that prefers quick combos. Mobile versions of the game were released on July 7, 2011 and a downloadable application for social networks was released on October 17, 2011. Additionally, an iOS version of the game, titled The King of Fighters-i-, feauring a reduced character roster, was released on July 7, 2011; an update of this version that includes six more characters was released on September 8, 2011. This same version was later ported to the Android platform on March 22, 2012, as The King of Fighters Android. An updated version featuring 12 new characters and other modes was released on iOS-based devices on May 3, 2012, called The King of Fighters-i 2012. This same version was released on Android on September 3, 2013 as The King of Fighters-A 2012. A new version of the game, including the characters introduced on the console ports as well as new revisions, was released in Japanese arcades on April 26, 2012, under the name The King of Fighters XIII Climax. Eisuke Ogura returns to do the character illustrations.Story  Magaki was slain by Shion's spear, and Shion vanished into the dimensional rift. Then other members of the group Heidern was tracking suddenly appeared and vanished, as if to mock Heidern and his team. Who are \"Those From the Distant Land,\" and why are they so persistent in their pursuit of the power of Orochi? Meanwhile, Ash Crimson, having obtained Kagura's power, chose to ignore Elisabeth's cautions and took on Iori Yagami's power. Yata was defeated, and Yasakani has fallen. Only one of the Three Sacred Treasures remains: the Sword of Kusanagi. However, Kyo Kusanagi suffered a major injury at the hands of Yagami, who had been overtaken by the power of the revitalized Orochi. Time has passed... With these recent incidents, it was feared that the next King of Fighters tournament would never happen. However, thanks to an unheard-of amount of promotion by a mysterious party, the KoF will be held on an unprecedented scale. The new mixed martial arts tournament is on the world stage, and the mass media has been giving it coverage like never before. Fighters all across the world begin to receive invitations... all sent from \"R\"!Gameplay Characters  The entire roster from The King of Fighters XII (including the two console exclusive characters) return in The King of Fighters XIII, arranged in the usual teams of three people. Both Mukai and Botan return. Rose Bernstein returns and is also the sponsor of this year's tournament. All the remaining members from Those from the Past group have their faces revealed and are being led by Saiki. When the game designer was asked about his personal thoughts for this new cast in an interview, he remarked that he isn't always looking forward to adding popular characters from other series. As before with KOF XII, the overall goal for the cast is to create contrasts and variations between each character for an interesting balance between teams. Whenever possible, he believes the characters in The King of Fighters should be reenacting a classic fist-to-fist battle rather than one that relies too much on additional weaponry. Lately, the desire to stay true to this theme in an interesting manner has decided who gets to appear in KOF.Elisabeth Team Japan Team Fatal Fury Team Art of Fighting Team Ikari Warriors Team Psycho Soldier Team Women Fighters Team Kim Team Yagami Team K' Team Mid-Boss Bosses Sub-Boss Final Boss Console/PC/Climax Exclusive Characters DLC/EX Characters Cosplay  Several alternate colors for the cast are homages to characters in other games or media.

He was first introduced in The King of Fighters '94 as the leader of the Japan team. He is the rival of Iori Yagami. He was first introduced as a cocky delinquent high school student who is the heir of the Kusanagi clan, one of the three clans that sealed the legendary snake entity, Orochi, 1,800 years ago. His clan wields pyrokinetic powers, an inherited power that few members obtain. They, along with the Yasakani and Yata clans, keep one of the three sacred treasures used to contain Orochi long ago. His family's treasure is the Kusanagi Sword (\u8349\u8599\u306e\u5263, Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi), and his family crest is the sun, represented in a stylized halo of fire. His official nickname is Scion of the Flame (\u708e \u306e \u8cb4\u516c\u5b50, Honoo no Kikoushi)  or The cleansing exorcising flame (\u706b\u708e \u7953 \u6fef, Kaen Harau Yusu). Aside from the main series, Kyo also has a spin-off manga story based on his adventure in The King of Fighters '96, entitled The King of Fighters: Kyo. A video game under the same name was also created to further expand his character. In addition, a number of image songs and audio dramas featuring Kyo's character have been released, including the contents of his own character image album consisting of all of his theme songs. He is a member of SNK's character image band, The Band of Fighters and also co-star alongside Iori in one of SNK's promotional series, Part Time Stories: Kyo & Iori. At Vigamus, a museum of videogames sponsored by the municipality of Rome, a special illustration lists Kyo as the mascot of the mid-90's era of Neo Geo.Development  When designing characters for the first The King of Fighters, developers wanted a new hip hero who would easily rival the Fatal Fury and Art of Fighting characters in style. Through most of his development, Kyo was meant to be called Syo Kirishima, and was dressed in martial arts clothing common with fighting games at the time. But late in production, his name became Kyo Kusanagi, likely due to the KOF story's change in direction towards the Yamata no Orochi legend. When designing Syo, Shinichi Morioka (Kyo and Iori's creator) used Shotaro Kaneda from the Akira manga as inspiration. When Syo appears as a striker in KOF 2000, he would be voiced by Mitsuo Iwata who also voiced Kaneda.  The idea for his flames -as well as the other elemental powers for the rest of the Japan team- was derived from the anime Getter Robo; in the show, there were three featured heroes who served as the inspiration for the KOF trio: the protagonist had a \"fiery\" persona, his friend was \"edgy and daring\", and the third hero was the \"down-to-earth giant\". It is also a homage to a Japanese phrase of giving birth to fire (roughly translated as \"lighting strikes the earth which sparks the flame\"). Other influences include Jo Yabuki and Akira Fudo from the respectively series Ashita no Joe and Devilman. His change in fighting style was also made as a part of the series's overhaul in The King of Fighters '96. To appease all fans, they also included an older version of Kyo from The King of Fighters '94 into The King of Fighters '97 and placed the '95 version of Kyo in '98, which made both versions of Kyo popular during location tests. The idea of having two versions of Kyo at once lead to the concept of his clones; during the early development stages of The King of Fighters '99, SNK planned to avoid adding any version of Kyo altogether, or Iori, to the game, as the story's focus was meant to center on the new protagonist, K'. However, they retracted this decision, as \"they couldn't leave these popular characters in limbo\". Since then, veteran developers for the series admit that Kyo's repeated appearances in the series is due to the marketers and the main planners' insistence to add him, Iori, and other SNK regulars in every game, making it a challenge to decide the story for each title. Kyo's voice actor, Masahiro Nonaka, related greatly with his character as being young and reckless until he \"grew up\" in his later appearances. He then expressed some difficulty accepting Kyo on the same level. According to Nobuyuki Kuroki, the staff wanted to provide a new design that would captivate new fans.  Despite Kyo being the main character, they decided to drastically change his hair and outfit. Despite fearing fans would not like Kyo's new appearance, the staff commented they aimed it as a challenge, commenting old players from the series would understand he is still the same character despite cosmetic changes. This new design, alongside Iori's, provoked major controversy during the time it was revealed. However in an interview, The King of Fighters XIV director Yasuyuki Oda said the team wanted the characters to carry a new look due to the game being set in a new story arc. Kyo, along with his rival, Iori, has been noted by several of the series's designers as being one of the most difficult characters to illustrate because of his popularity amongst fans. In Gamest's 1997 Heroes Collection, Kyo was voted as the staff's second favorite character. In the Neo Geo Freak's 1997 Volume 8 character poll, he was voted as the favourite character overall, with a total of 2,160 votes.  620 votes from the male fans and 1,540 votes from the female fans. In a 2005 poll made by SNK-Playmore USA, he was voted as the sixth fan favorite character with a total of 176 votes. In the character popularity poll on Neo Geo Freak's website, he was voted as the third favorite character with a total of 2,574 votes. In an interview with one of the manhua artist and authors, Wing Yan, he replies that Kyo is his favorite original character in the series. Garou: Mark of the Wolves planner and The King of Fighters XIV producer Yasuyuki Oda states that Kyo and Leona are his favourite characters in The King of Fighters series.Story Clan Background  660 years ago, the Kusanagi and Yasakani clans were once allies. However, due to a horrible misunderstanding, the Yasakani struck a blood pact with Orochi for more power. They renamed their family name to Yagami, and their flames, previously red like their former allies, changed to violet from Orochi's taint. Since then, the clans have waged a generation long grudge with casualties made from both sides. It continues in The King of Fighters series with Kyo and Iori Yagami.Orochi Saga  The Orochi saga takes place between The King of Fighters '94 and '97. Kyo surpassed his father at the age of fifteen and was designated as the clan's leader. Shortly after the completion of his training, Kyo competes in a preliminary held in Japan to determine the members of the country's representative team in the King of Fighters tournament. He bests Goro Daimon and Benimaru Nikaido to become the leader of the team, the two becoming his teammates and eventual friends. They reach the finals, where they met the host of the tournament, a powerful fighter named Rugal Bernstein. Rugal boasts his desire to fight powerful opponents and challenges them. After his defeat, he self-destructs his ship in attempt to bring them with him, but the team escapes unharmed. Afterwards, Kyo decides to travel abroad in order to train. In the following year, Daimon and Benimaru were waiting for Kyo's ship to dock, when they were attacked by a masked assailant. Kyo returns and throws a fireball at the mysterious person, only to destroy her mask and reveal her to be Rugal's secretary. She hands over an invitation letter to another King of Fighters tournament, organized once again by Rugal, who survived his craft's self-destruction. This time, Rugal also brainwashed Kyo's missing father, Saisyu, into attacking his son. Kyo's father regains his senses after he was subdued by the team. To counter the team's strength, Rugal challenges them with power sapped from Orochi. However, Rugal's body was overwhelmed by the power's immensity and he was vaporized after his defeat. Pleased with his son's prowess, Saisyu leaves unnoticed, insinuating that he entrusts the clan's duty to Kyo. Prior to the events of The King of Fighters '96, a mysterious man -later revealed to be one of the \"Four Heavenly Kings\" of Orochi, Goenitz- challenges Kyo to a fight. Kyo arrives, powered by his overwhelming confidence in his fists, only to be defeated soundly by his challenger and sent to the hospital. In spite of his injuries, his anger and spirit from his loss drove him to invent powerful new techniques (this is the canon explanation for Kyo trading his projectile attack-based technique set for his now trademark flame-laced melee attack strings). He enters the year's tournament to prove his strength to his unknown attacker. In the tournament's finals, he meets the host of the tournament and the younger heiress of the Yata clan, Chizuru Kagura. At the tournament's end, he vanquishes Goenitz with Iori and Chizuru's help. Though he is warned by Chizuru of his clan's destiny with Orochi, Kyo ignores her and promptly departs. Before The King of Fighters '97 takes place, he is pestered by fellow high school student, Shingo Yabuki, to teach him how to create his flames. Though annoyed and flustered by his persistence, Kyo partially agrees to mentor him as a means of gaining free meals. He also experiences nightmares of a strange man defeating him at the King of Fighters tournament, but continues to participate. Before the tournament, his girlfriend, Yuki was kidnapped by the Hakkesshu, in order to be used as the last of the sacrificial maidens for Orochi's revival. Though it's ambiguous as to which team he enters during the tournament, it is canonly accepted that Kyo joins with Iori and Chizuru for its conclusion. He advances into the finals, where he confronts the remaining \"Four Heavenly Kings\" of Orochi, Yashiro Nanakase, Shermie, and Chris. The Hakkesshu also mention the plan to sacrifice Yuki in order to revive Orochi. Fueled by these turn of events, Kyo fights an emotional and heroic battle. When they are beaten, Orochi possesses Chris' body and attempts to destroy the three clans at once. As was done in the legends of their clans, the trio successfully defeat him. In a last-ditch effort, Orochi (manifested in Chris' body) causes Iori to enter the berserk Riot of the Blood state, expecting him to turn on Kyo and Chizuru. Instead, Iori snares Orochi by the neck, and Kyo obliged his rival by crippling the great demon with one last deathblow, allowing Chizuru to reseal Orochi. Exhausted, Kyo passes out. The last thing he sees is Yuki, saying that she will wait for him.NESTS Saga  The King of Fighters '99 took place immediately after the events of The King of Fighters '97. Still knocked out from his previous battle with the godlike Orochi, Kyo was taken by the NESTS syndicate and his DNA was used to make various beings for their purposes. He awoke one day to find himself surrounded by bizarre gadgets and needles. Deciding to search for answers, Kyo broke out of captivity and managed to escape the hidden fortress despite the sedatives. While escaping, he constantly heard references to the NESTS cartel. He tries to personally gain answers from his captors, but is forced to retreat when the base around him begins to collapse. He decides not to come back home before NESTS is taken down and attempts to investigate privately again the following year but learns very little. As the fiasco of South Town's destruction ensued, Iori confronts him and they fight to an unknown outcome. In The King of Fighters 2001, Kyo reunites with his old teammates and Shingo to make a comeback in the Japan Team. They join the now NESTS-sponsored KoF tournament to relive their time together as a team and to fight NESTS. They disband as soon as the tournament is over, leaving Shingo to muse about life. In the official novel, Japan Team makes it to the semi-finals, however he and Iori separate from their teammates and fight elsewhere. Like the fight in 2000, the outcome is unknown.Tales of Ash  In The King of Fighters 2003, Chizuru appeared to both Kyo and Iori, requesting that they form a team and investigate suspicious activities concerning the Orochi. Kyo initially protested allying with Iori (though Iori apparently did not do likewise), but relented to form the Sacred Treasures team. After the defeat of Mukai, the team then investigated the weakening Orochi seal that they had been transported to after Mukai's defeat, but were ambushed by Ash Crimson, who stole the Yata Mirror from Chizuru, promising to go after Iori next. Ash escaped, and Kyo swore vengeance. In The King of Fighters XI, Shingo has volunteered to join Kyo and Iori, in Chizuru's name. After several attempts, Kyo abides to Shingo's requests and joins forces with his groupie and his rival, in order to stop Ash. However, after he and his team defeat Magaki, the growing presence of the Orochi, caused Iori to snap and enter the Riot of the Blood state, and he trashed Kyo and Shingo in a berserk fit. Ash appeared thereafter and stole the Yasakani no Magatama within Iori's body, along with his flames. The Rival Team (Benimaru, Duo Lon, and Elisabeth Blanctorche) arrived after the incident, to whom Ash tells them that Kyo will be next. The incident had Kyo hospitalized, but he escapes rather than wait for his recovery. As he wanders the city, he encounters a mysterious boy and his female partner, who try to attack him. Showing them his flames, they hand him the \"R\" invitation before taking their leave. Soon after the encounter, Benimaru and Daimon find him. Seeing no need to visit the hospitalized Shingo or Chizuru, he reunites with his old team members to relive his past glory days together with them. After Ash disappears and Kyo's team won another tournament, Iori appears and challenges Kyo to a fight. Kyo accepts and the rivals fight to an undecided outcome.XIV Arc  When the tournament was announced, Saisyu informs Kyo of a new threat which will cause untold chaos. At his father request, Kyo enters the tournament once again with his old teammates. After the tournament's conclusion, Kyo advices Shun'ei to keep training to control his power. At the airport, after sending his teammates off, he heads to Hungary. Chizuru had called him there for his assistance in dealing with a revived, yet weakened Orochi, whom Iori found earlier.Personality  Kyo is the over-confident but well meaning protagonist of the series, more interested in enjoying life than having to partake in any particular responsibilities. He is quick to dismiss subjects that don't interest him and will often carry out his actions with a devil-may-care attitude. Despite his seemingly arrogant and rude demeanor, he treasures his friends and family, enjoying their presence and particularly doting on his girlfriend, Yuki. His extreme disinterest in studies has led to his chronic inability to graduate from high school (which has become subject to in-jokes). Although he is confident in his poetic talent, most of his poems aren't considered to be good by his listeners. Kyo takes his clan's responsibilities on a more personal level, disregarding ancient legends and predestined events as any reason for his actions. His strong sense of justice and his zeal to fight stronger opponents are what he believes to drive him to carry out his destiny. His rivalry with Iori is one of mutual hatred and was hardly spurred by their clans' history. When Kyo and Iori join forces, it is often begrudgingly and as a last resort solution to the conflict at hand.Powers Skills Fighting Style  Kyo fights using the Kusanagi style of ancient martial arts, a Japanese style of empty handed combat taught only to the Kusanagi clan members. Like most of the clan members in modern times, these are labeled as Method/Style with numbers; numbers that actually use alternate kanji different from their originals. These examples are 108 Shiki: Yami Barai (Method 108: Darkness Sweeper), etc. with \"Reverse Methods\" being stronger versions of other attacks such as Kyo's signature DM, Ura 108 Shiki: Orochinagi (Reverse Method 108: Great Serpent Mower) being an example. In some sources, this even applies to his \"unnamed\" normal attacks. Kyo also knows Kenpo, and uses it in most of his normal attacks. Kyo's moveset emphasizes Kenpo from KOF '96 onwards, discarding his 108 Shiki: Yami Barai and 101 Shiki: Oboroguruma (Method 101: Hazy Wheel), making way for a series of completely new techniques which are a series of chain punches (the 114 Shiki: Aragami/Method 114: Wild Bite and 115 Shiki: Dokugami/Method 115: Poison Bite) with several different followups, and thus adds a varying amount of kicks and elbow dropping attacks which are also types of notable moves in Kenpo. The names of Kyo's new moves are anything but vague and simple names (such as 402 Shiki: Batsu Yomi/Method 402: Punish Recital and 125 Shiki: Nanase/Method 125: Seven Rapids), possibly due to Kyo's taste for poetry. Thus, Kyo is a strong combo character that takes a while to master as his moveset from KOF '96 and following games explodes to ridiculous levels. Mastering it though allowed players to more easily adapt to use other characters that had more diverse movesets. Kyo made way for archetypes with moves that not only had multiple inputs, but each followup had its own unique features. This would also pave way for powerful mixups and combos if pressure was well-setup. Story-wise, this was possibly due to his initial defeat by Goenitz, Kyo reformed his style into a more-offensive focus. In the original games (especially in KOF '95), Kyo followed the \"Ryu and Ken\" archetype with Iori, as Kyo's moves differ slightly from game to game in the same manner as Iori, mainly their Desperation Moves. Changes in KOF '96 and onwards made them vastly different from each other. Alternate versions of Kyo would retain his old movesets from older games for nostalgia's sake, though each alternate version would be notably different from game to game. The 100 Shiki: Oniyaki (Method 100: Ogre Baker) is the one technique both Kyo and Iori still share to this day. In KOF 99 onwards, Kyo even applies personal touches derived from his father's techniques of the Kusanagi style, via his Hikigane (Plowing Iron) mimicking Saisyu's Kamukakari (Divine Consult) and even adapting his father's Nata Guruma (Hatchet Wheel) attack in KOF: Maximum Impact 2. In KOF 2003, Kyo, Iori, and Chizuru's LDM's are all named the San Shingi (Three Divine Arts), taking after their clans, destinies, and treasures. Kyo's San Shingi no Ichi (Three Divine Arts No. 1) however, is his SDM version Saishuu Kessen Ougi: Mu Shiki (Final Play-Off Secret Skill: No Method), as opposed to Iori and Chizuru's versions being original attacks. In The King of Fighters XII and XIII, his default self switches back to his old KOF '94/'95 moveset. His Neo Max in XIII, the Ama-No-Murakumo (Gathering Clouds of Heaven) is a reference to the original name of his heirloom. His NESTS-Style version uses his traditional \"Kenpo chain punch\" moveset, and is given a Neo Max named Saishuu Kessen Hiougi: Totsuka (Final Play-Off Hidden Secret Skill: Ten Fists), a nod to the famous Totsuka-no-Tsurugi (Sword of Ten Fists). Another possible nod is his 182 Shiki/Method 182, a powerful flaming punch attack, which may be the finishing blow dealt by Kyo to Orochi in the Orochi Saga's end (though in some other games, the 182 has a different animation, while its SDM version in XIV is a combination of its two different animations). Also, two other new moves in XIV that compliment his poetic taste are an overhead finishing move to his new low-attacking Munotsuchi (Six Mallets) followup from Aragami, and his Climax DM; they are respectively known as Tsurube Otoshi (Well Bucket Fall; a term for sinking quickly) and Yaegaki (Double Fences; a term for fences over fences). A notable trait that makes Kyo stand out in the Maximum Impact games is that while the input windows are fairly tight, some of his Stylish Arts are styled akin to a majority of crouching light kick-to-light punch normal attacks in the original 2D games.Music Image Songs Voice Actors Live Action Actors Game Appearances Mobile Appearances Cameo Appearances Anime Appearances Similar Characters See also Trivia References Iori Yagami  Iori Yagami (\u516b\u795e \u5eb5, Yagami Iori) is a character who made his first appearance in The King of Fighters '95. He is a central recurring character, and the initial enemy (and eventual rival) of Kyo Kusanagi. He is the heir to one of the three clans that sealed the legendary snake entity, Orochi, 1,800 years ago. His clan, formerly known as the Yasakani (\u516b\u5c3a\u74ca, Yasakani), wields pyrokinetic powers. They keep the seal over Orochi intact with help from the Kusanagi and Yata clans using three ancient artifacts. His family's treasure is the Yasakani Jewel (\u516b\u5c3a\u74ca\u66f2\u7389, Yasakani no Magatama) and his family crest is the crescent moon, which he wears on the back of his old jacket. He also wears a plain silver ring around his left middle finger; the significance of the ring, if any, is unknown. His official nickname is Flame of the End (\u7d42\u7109\u306e\u708e, Sh\u016ben no hon\u014d) . In XII and XIII it's Unbridled Instinct (\u89e3\u304d\u653e\u305f\u308c\u3057 \u672c\u80fd, Tokihanatareshi Honnou) and with his flames; Iori who has recovered his flames (\u708e \u3092 \u53d6\u308a\u623b\u3057\u305f \u5eb5, Honoo wo Tomoridoshita Iori). . Aside from the main body of the King of Fighters series, Iori features his own drama CD and character image album. His character is also a member of SNK's character image band, Band of Fighters and he also appears as a regular antagonist in the spin-off manga, The King of Fighters: Kyo. Part Time Stories: Kyo & Iori also co-star him and Kyo working together at SNK for the promotion of the company's merchandise.Development  One of the main objectives planned for The King of Fighters '95 was to properly introduce Iori as Kyo's rival. Creators have stated Iori's personality and other aspects to his character \"broke the mold for characters in fighting games at that time\". In several interviews for their official anniversary site for the series, several creators and developers\u2014such as C.A.C Yamasaki and Mr. Marito\u2014predicted that Iori would be popular on his release, which they admit happened during their observations of initial location testing for The King of Fighters '95. Because of his popularity amongst fans, some of the main designers for the series have stated that he is \"difficult to draw for\". Illustrator Shinkiro thought Iori as one of the series's most wild characters because of his hairstyle , with similar sentiments being made by Last Blade illustrator, TONKO and manhua artists Wing Yan and King Tung. Additionally, KOF: Maximum Impact producer, Falcoon, stated that attempting to change an \"untouchable\" design such as Iori's put him under severe pressure. He stated that designing Iori's alternate (or \"Another\", as it is stated in the Maximum Impact games) outfit almost felt \"unforgivable\", unsure of fans' reaction to the change. In an interview with a group of the series's voice actors, Kunihiko Yasui, Iori's voice actor, explains that the staff for the games treat their characters as normal people, and are constantly changing their character line-up to reflect this. He adds that he feels responsible as a voice actor for his performances as Iori, taking care to sound different in each instalment as a means of developing, as well as \"protecting\", his character's humanity. Another minor development to his character was his ever changing \"most valued possession/valued treasure\" information. His bios from KoF '95 until KoF '98 listed various items such as a vintage guitar and chains. A girlfriend was also listed more than once, specifically in KoF '95, KoF '99, and KoF 2000. However, starting in The King of Fighters 2001 and every entry onwards, the space is listed as \"None\". This has led to several fan theories as to why this is, many of which surrounds his girlfriend's possible death or disappearance. The issue is briefly touched upon years before in Iori's drama CD, The Sun and The Moon ~ Prologue, though a concise answer concerning this shade to his profile hasn't been made by SNK. According to Nobuyuki Kuroki, Iori was one of the characters he wanted to change, however he wanted the hair to remain untouched. He had the designer Eisuke Ogura create his new outfit and the end result impressed him. Additionally, he asked the modeller to have the character exude a masculine sex appeal and to also pay close attention to the details of his eyes. This new design, alongside Kyo's, provoked major controversy during the time it was revealed. However in an interview, The King of Fighters XIV director Yasuyuki Oda said the team wanted the characters to carry a new look due to the game being set in a new story arc. In the Neo Geo Freak's 1997 Volume 8 character poll, he was voted as the sixth favourite character with a total of 1,292 votes. 209 votes from the male fans and 1,083 votes from the female fans. In Gamest's 1997 Heroes Collection, Iori was voted as the staff's favorite character, claiming 1st place out of fifty other characters. He also received the same rank on Neo Geo Freak's website with a total of 3,792 votes. In a 2005 poll made by SNK-Playmore USA, he was voted as the eighth fan favorite character with 145 votes.Story Legend of Yasakani  660 years before the game takes place, Orochi's seal began to weaken. The three clans decided to move its vessel into another location. Wanting to disrupt their unity, one of the Hakkesshu killed the leader of the Yasakani's wife. Under a disguise, the murderer then approached the Yasakani head and reported that the Kusanagi clan was responsible, saying that it was \"atonement\" for letting the seal weaken. To add more fuel to the fire, the corpse of his wife was found in the Kusanagi homeland. Angered by the revelation, the Yasakani made a blood pact with Orochi to gain the necessary means for revenge. Gaining a forbidden technique called \"Kin Sen Hyaku Juuichi Shiki: Ya Otome\" (Forbidden Method 1211: Eight Maidens), the Yasakani renamed themselves as the Yagami clan. As a side-effect of the Orochi's curse, the once crimson flames of the Yagami have a bluish tint. The curse also causes each heir to die young and each mother to die in childbirth.Orochi Saga  Before the events of The King of Fighters '95 tournament, Billy Kane and Eiji Kisaragi end a sudden duel in a draw. Billy then introduces Eiji to Iori who comes in dragging the body of one of Geese's assassins. Overwhelmed by Iori's strength, Billy invites both Eiji and Iori to form the Rival team to enter the tournament. Iori joins them as a means to meet his rival. At the finals, he helps the hero team defeat Rugal Bernstein. Before Rugal dies, Iori mocks him for trying to use the power of Orochi. Claiming that such power could only belong to him, Iori severely injuries his fellow team members. He then declares Kyo and his clan will be next. Before the King of Fighters '96 tournament, Iori is visited by two mysterious women who introduce themselves as Vice and Mature. They tell him of Kyo's entry in the tournament and try to coerce him to join as well. After a brief fight, he agrees to enter once the two submit to be his servants, intending to use them to help him kill his rival. When he leaves, Vice and Mature contact their employer, Goenitz, ensuring him everything was going to their plan. During the finals of the tournament, he helps his rival and Chizuru Kagura, heir to the Yata clan, to defeat Goenitz. The former dies leaving a warning to not underestimate the power of Orochi or Yagami. Vice and Mature are left shaken by the ill omen. It is then when Iori suddenly undergoes symptoms of the Riot of the Blood. Unable to control this surge of Orochi power, Iori violently kills his companions. Before the events of the King of Fighters '97 tournament, Iori learns of his rival's entry from the local news. Later that night, he has a nightmare of two women mocking his inability to defeat Kyo. The women disappear with the promise of meeting him again soon. When he awakes, he coughs up blood. Filled with a sudden hate and rage, he declares to defeat his rival. However, at the tournament's conclusion, he joins both Kyo and Chizuru again. He advances into the finals, where he confronts the remaining \"Four Heavenly Kings\" of Orochi, Yashiro Nanakase, Shermie, and Chris. When they are beaten, Orochi possesses Chris' body and attempts to destroy the three clans at once. As was done in the legends of their clans, the trio successfully defeat him. In a last-ditch effort, Orochi causes Iori to enter the Riot of Blood, expecting him to turn on Kyo and Chizuru. Instead, Iori snares Orochi by the neck, and Kyo obliges his rival by crippling the great demon with one last deathblow, allowing Chizuru to reseal Orochi.NESTS Saga  Shortly after discovering the creation of clones of Kyo, Iori gained word of another King of Fighters tournament, and he began to suspect that the person responsible for cloning Kyo might be there. Iori followed the battles from the shadows, and eventually found an abandoned warehouse where Krizalid had fought the New Hero Team. The whereabouts of Iori were unknown after KOF '99, and it is assumed he cared little about Southtown and the events of KOF 2000, instead focusing on the opportunity for a fight against his rival. The next year, an agent named Seth invited Iori to join his team for the next King of Fighters tournament, under the presumption that he would get his shot against Kyo if he entered. Iori made it clear from the beginning of the tournament that teamwork was irrelevant, as he could take on whole teams by himself. In the official novel, during the time of the semi-finals, he and Kyo separate from their teams and fight elsewhere.Tales of Ash  In The King of Fighters 2003, Iori reluctantly teamed up again with Kyo and Chizuru Kagura at the latter's request, as it seemed that the current tournament might be linked to the Orochi. Before they could seal Orochi, Ash Crimson stole Chizuru's powers. He then made an offer of servitude to Iori, who answered with a fiery attack, which prompted Ash to disappear while Kyo swore revenge. With the defeat of Chizuru and the crippled Orochi seal spelling possible catastrophe, it seemed that the Yagami clan would soon be changed forever. In The King of Fighters XI, Iori agrees on Chizuru's request to team up with Kyo and Shingo Yabuki in hopes of opposing Ash. Iori and Kyo defeat Magaki, however the strengthening presence of Orochi caused Iori to enter the Riot of Blood, in which he trashed Kyo and Shingo before Ash Crimson appeared and stole Iori's sacred treasure, the Yasakani Jewel, and his power. Before the KOF XIII tournament, Iori pays a visit to Chizuru to see if she needs her treasure to use her power. Realizing that his predictions are true, she presents Iori with the prospect of ridding the Orochi curse from his bloodline since he is no longer hindered by his treasure. Uninterested in rectifying his family's mistake, he remarks that Chizuru's mirror will return in due time and leaves. With Mature and Vice haunting him to join the tournament with them, they perk his interest to settle matters with Ash. At the tournament's climax, Iori regains his treasure once Ash disappears. Mature and Vice remark that he can still choose to refuse the treasure, saving himself from the Orochi curse once and for all. He questions what will happen to his teammates if he should accept the treasure again, but they voice that he should choose whatever he thinks is right. He decides to reclaim his flames, his teammates disappear and he challenges Kyo to an undecided outcome.XIV Arc  Mature and Vice warn him of a new threat. During Verse's invasion, Iori senses the souls trapped within Verse. Once Verse is defeated, Iori tracks down Orochi's weakened soul in Hungary and helps to reseal it with Chizuru and Kyo.Personality  Iori is a serious, blunt and rude character. He is not interested in making friends or enemies, only showing investment in getting results that appeal to him. In various drama CDs, Iori is frequently tormented by an Orochi identity that resides within him, which mocks and belittles him as its \"master\". Iori can be sympathetic to other people, but his Orochi persona often threatens to take over and harm them. Iori tries to ignore it until it angers him, causing him to physically snap in a usually violent manner. In his KOF XII profile, he seems to have trouble knowing which identity is actually his and suffers from a slight identity crisis. It's due to this personal trait that he doesn't like to associate with others and he lives as a lone wolf. He still retains pride for his humanity and won't let himself die under any circumstances. The matter of losing his flames has not personally scarred or affected him in any way. Regarding his family duties and his ancient family feud, Iori doesn't care much for them. If the Orochi seal is threatened, however, Iori doesn't back down from the challenge of re-sealing it. His participation often provokes Kyo's pride enough to begrudgingly bring the Three Sacred Treasures together. Iori seems to want to clash with his rival whenever they meet; he can't recall the reasons why he hates Kyo. Like his rival, Iori just seems to instinctively hate him. Despite Iori's violent and sadistic personality, killing people in both Orochi Saga and NESTS Saga, he still follows his own moral code which was touched upon in The King of Fighters '97 \uff5e660nen Hi no Futari~. After brutally beating Shingo who challenged him to a fight, he tells Shingo that he isn't low enough to take pleasure in bullying the weak and promptly leaves. In regards to whomever he is partnered with, at best, he can be dismissive, distant and blunt but cooperative, and apathetic and treacherous at worst. Eiji Kisaragi and Billy Kane have seen the worst of Iori, while Kyo, Chizuru and Shingo has seen reasonably civil treatment from him despite being distant. He is notably dismissive, confrontational and even borderline traitorous when it comes to Vice and Mature, being his natural enemy; however, Vice and Mature have ironically shown some concern and care for his welfare.Powers Skills Fighting Style  Iori fights with the Yasakani style of ancient martial arts, which is a violent offensive style incorporating use of claws. He uses his instincts to fight as well. Like the other two clans, Iori's moves/clan techniques are numbered in a personal \"style/method\" order with alternate kanji used for the numbers. The only moves Iori has ever shared with Kyo are the 108 Shiki: Yami Barai (Method 108: Darkness Sweeper), and the 100 Shiki: Oniyaki (Method 100: Ogre Baker); the latter being the move they both share to this day. However, Kyo later discards the Darkness Sweeper in favor of his Kenpo chain punching style, making the two vastly different from each other. Like a few select characters, the naming even applies to his \"unnamed\" normal attacks in other sources. Iori's \"Riot of the Blood\" super in Neo Geo Battle Coliseum looks identical to the scene shown in his KoF '96 ending when he killed Mature and Vice. A majority of his clan's techniques have nods to the legends of Orochi as a possible foil to Kyo: In terms of gameplay, Iori is a powerful rushdown character with highly damaging combos. Players would need to be careful as failing to master Iori would prevent using him to his full potential. His most popular command normal, Geshiki: Yuri Ori (Outer Method: Lily Snapper), is a backwards kick that is meant only for crossing up making Iori unique in this aspect. In most games as of KoF '98, Iori can use it in a backdash for a quick getaway. From there, Iori conned the discovery of certain midair attacks being available during a backdash (which was presumed to be a bug at the time), such as Kyo's Geshiki: Naraku Otoshi (Outer Method: Abyssal Drop) and Robert's Hien Ryuujin Kyaku (Flying Swallow Dragon God Leg). Iori is surprisingly an avid zoning-type character, as his Yami Barai gives him an advantage in keep-away due to the movement styles in KoF. His Kuzukaze (Scum Wind, affectionately mistranslated as \"Scum Gale\") was also a unique kind of attack during its time as it was a throw that did no damage, and allowed Iori for a quick combo and provided massive pressure setups via tick throwing. It was originally his kick throw back in KOF95 before being repurposed as a command throw, being replaced by a variant of his punch throw, called Gyaku Saka Hagi. His moveset was fairly limited compared to Kyo's, but much easier to access. Because of his high potential overshadowing most of his weaknesses if played right, Iori is generally seen as top-tier in several of his appearances, and through his status as top-tier character, Iori can canonically in-universe be regarded as one of the most powerful fighters in the series, as so far any mention of him losing in the preliminaries is a rarity. His flame-less fighting style appears somewhat faster (albeit less mobile) in KoF XII; his combos seem to have become easier to chain with a slightly higher priority. His old \"With Flames\" version appears again on the console versions of KoF XIII, though some of this version's original touches have been stripped off for somewhat better balance compared to his default, flame-less version. His Neo Max in KoF XIII is called Kin 1218 Shiki: Yatagarasu (Forbidden Method 1218: Eight-Span Crow), a reference to the legendary creature of the same name; during this, Iori enters a brief feral state (with the screen darkening). With this in mind, it is assumed that Iori without his flames or his clan's curse hindering him, his true fighting instinct is unleashed and can be easily sensed by others (as noted by Takuma). In XIV however, Iori akin to other moves such as his SDM Ya Otome in older games and his Homura Hotogi (as either an HSDM/MAX2DM or Neo Max), undergoes a slight transformation into a crazed state more akin to the Riot of Blood when he uses the Yatagarasu. Also, Iori's San Shingi no Ni (The Divine Arts No. Two) is the very attack used to pin down Orochi in which Kyo manages to followup the finishing blow in the Sacred Treasures Team's ending of The King of Fighters '97. The very sequence is seen in Kyo and Iori's Special D-Assault in Neo Geo Battle Coliseum. Also, the technique is often named \"?????\" in Orochi Iori's moveset. Iori's (in)famous dropkick sweep attack is also notable for an oddity; while it is treated like a low-hitting attack when blocking it normally, it is instead treated as a mid-hitting attack when countered/reversed or against anything with low-level invincibility.Music Image Songs Voice Actors Live Action Actors Game Appearances Mobile Appearances Cameo Appearances Anime Appearances Similar Characters See also Trivia References Mai Shiranui  Mai Shiranui (\u4e0d\u77e5\u706b \u821e, Shiranui Mai) is a character from both the Fatal Fury and The King of Fighters series of fighting games by SNK. Her official nickname is The Alluring Ninja Girl (\u9b45\u60d1 \u306e \u5973\u5fcd\u8005, Miwaku no Kunoichi). She was originally not planned to be included in Fatal Fury at all, as her fighting style was created for a different male ninja. When developers shifted their focus to including an idol character into the series, they decided to scrap the Shiranui man for Mai. Her characteristic \"bounce\" was loosely modified from a kunoichi (female ninja) method of assassination: to be sensual to their unassuming prey before they strike. According to an issue of Neo Geo Freak, her breasts were modeled after Fumie Hosokawa and her bottom is modeled after the late-Ai Iijima; both women were famous idols at the time. Due to Mai's vast popularity among fans; she has been in most promotional art, game art, themes, and merchandise out of any character making her the female mascot and sex symbol of SNK. Mai was rated #4 in GameSpy.com's \"Top Ten Babes in Games\" feature and #5 in Game Informer's \"Top Ten Hottest Girls of the 16-Bit era.\" In the Neo Geo Freak's 1997 Volume 8 character poll, she was voted as the third favourite character with a total of 1,604 votes. 199 votes from the male fans and 1,405 votes from the female fans. In the character popularity poll on Neo Geo Freak's website, she was voted as the fifth favorite character with a total of 2,380 votes. On Falcoon's SNK 40th anniversary page he states that both Mai and Terry are his favourite SNK characters. Along with the many figures and merchandise that have been made in her image, she has made an outside game appearance in the spin off series Queens Gate.History Fatal Fury  Mai Shiranui is the granddaughter of Hanzo Shiranui, master of ninjitsu and Koppo-ken. Mai learned from her father the secrets of Ninjitsu. She had met Andy Bogard, during this time, who had come to train under her grandfather. Mai then had to take alternate courses from her grandfather's friend, Jubei Yamada in ninjitsu. At first, Mai was uninterested in Andy and only thought of him as another callous man only interested in his training. It wasn't until he gave her a present on her birthday that she saw him in another light and eventually fell in love with him. She spends much of the series endlessly pursuing Andy and fantasizing various daydreams about their wedding. When developers were asked about her whereabouts during Mark of the Wolves, they chose not to answer the question directly. However, they did divulge that she still loves Andy \u2014 as she always has \u2014 ten years later.The King of Fighters  During nearly every King of Fighters tournament, Mai pesters Andy to enter and form a team with her. Upset at his refusals and choice to join a separate team, she forms an all women team with the help of Yuri and King. In the following years her teammates change, but she remains firm to enter the tournament to help encourage King and her fellow team members and to prove to Andy the error of his ways. In King of Fighters 99, she is finally able to join the tournament in the same team as Andy. However, in the following tournament was asked to step out to allow Blue Mary investigate a case. Denied again, she is angered by the request and joins the Women's team again and has remained a reoccurring member ever since. In the various team endings, she is often celebrating the team's victory at King's bar or fantasizing about Andy. Mai did not participate in the KOF XI to search for Andy, who was busy at training his disiple, Hokutomaru. Later, Mai decides to enter the KOF XIII with her first KOF teammates, King and Yuri, as she felt that the KOF tournament isn't complete without her. She isn't upset at Andy while making her choice, content to enter a tournament with both her and him in it once more.Personality  Mai is a very cheerful and temperamental girl. She tends to also be somewhat of an airhead and admires any kind of beauty or attractiveness, which sometimes comes across as being vain. She also at times compares attractive boys who flirt with her or acknowledge her beauty to Andy, acknowledging their attractiveness but ending with a comment saying they're 'not as cute as Andy'. Like many girls, she has dreams of getting married to\u00a0her Prince Charming. She found that same Prince Charming in Andy and self-proclaimed herself his fianc\u00e9, which at times, has\u00a0creeped out Andy himself. A notable example of this is her intro with Andy in KOF97, proposing to Andy outright in a wedding dress, or scaring Andy with a mock child doll in KOF '99 and 2001. Despite this, Andy mutually acknowledges her love, but prefers to keep quiet about it. Although her peppy fighting persona suggests otherwise, Mai is actually a traditional and ideal Japanese beauty. However, her pride as a Shiranui ninja and infatuation with Andy usually keeps her from fitting the mold 100% of the time.Powers Skills Fighting Style  Mai uses the Shiranui-ryuu form of ninjutsu combined with her fire powers to fight. Her style resembles normal ninjutsu with more graceful and majestic moves, somewhat in reference to traditional Japanese dance. She also uses paper fans as weapons, integrating them into her combat technique and using them to perform several combinations and moves. Her clothing, specifically, the tassle on her ninja garb, is also used to attack the opponent. She's also exceptional in hand to hand combat using different throws and techniques to gain the upper hand. Mai has shown great Strength as well being strong enough to throw enemies heavier than her and using her strong elbow strike capable of breaking through her enemies defense's incapacitating them.Music Image Songs Voice Actors Live Action Actors Game Appearances Mobile Appearances Cameo Appearances Anime Appearances See also References Samurai Shodown (series)  Samurai Shodown, known in Japan as Samurai Spirits (\u30b5\u30e0\u30e9\u30a4\u30b9\u30d4\u30ea\u30c3\u30c4) is the name of a versus fighting game series by SNK. It is considered to be the premier 2D weapons fighter, and is one of the best-known video games created by SNK. Despite the name of the series, most of the characters are not samurai in the true sense of the word. In Japan, the name of the series is officially in katakana, but is alternately written in kanji (\u4f8d\u9b42, Samurai Damashii), with the second character pronounced supiritsu, \"spirits\", to better reflect the game's setting. The earlier arcade games are also notorious for their \"Engrish\", such as the word 'victoly' which appears at the end of each match. In fact, even the title is misspelled, although the recent additions of the series have since fixed this error. As with many game titles developed in Japan, Samurai Spirits had its name changed for other regions.Overview  The stories in the series takes place in 18th century Japan, during the Sakoku or seclusion period of Japan, (the first four games run across 1788 and 1789) with great artistic license so that foreign-born characters (including some from places that didn't exist as such in 1788) and fictional monsters can also be part of the story. The plot of each game is quite different, but they circle a central group of characters and a region in Japan. Samurai Shodown consequently portrays snippets of the Japanese culture and language internationally with little edits. For instance, unlike most American versions of Japanese video games, the characters in the series (including the announcer) generally speak only in Japanese, with dialects ranging from archaic formalities and theatricalism to modern-day slang. Win quotes and other cut scenes provide subtitles in several languages, including but not limited to English, Portuguese, and German. Much of the music includes traditional Japanese instruments (predominately the shakuhachi) and later enka. Several characters are loosely based on real people from Japanese history. There are two main artists responsible for the character designs and illustrations. For the early games (Part 1 to 4), the characters are created and illustrated by Shiroi Eiji. His illustrations featured a distinctive, traditional Japanese calligraphy style. While he continues to design for a few of the later games, they are illustrated by another artist named Kita Senri until the fifth title. The Samurai Shodown games are most famous for their \"POW\" or \"rage\" gauge, a super combo gauge that only increases as a player receives damage. Earlier games also have a referee in the background, officiating the match.Plot  Here is the official timeline taken from the official Samurai Shodown V website: The series begins during the Tenmei famine in Japan, which lead to a severe depression and near chaos throughout the country. Upset by his country men's lamentations and the shogun's indifference to their plight, former Tokugawa general, Kyogoku Hinowanokami Gaoh, stages a rebellion in his land, Hinowa, against the reigning Tokugawa. He also hopes that his revolt will make the next shogun in line, Yoshitora Tokugawa, realize his responsibilities to his country. The war caused by the conflict gains the interest from several warriors. At the war's end, Gaoh is defeated and Yoshitora is made the next shogun. More than a decade before the series begins, Shiro Tokisada Amakusa (loosely based on the historical figure), once the leader of a Christian rebellion, made a pact with an evil entity named Ambrosia moments before his execution. Using the body of Shinzo, one of Hanzo Hattori's sons, he resurrects himself two years after the events of Hinowa. He plans to get revenge on those who reigned against him, intending to resurrect Ambrosia into the mortal realm upon his release. He steals the sacred item, the Palenke Stone, from Green Hell to gain the necessary power he needs for the ritual. The sorcerer's activity stirs evil phenomena across the globe, stretching from Japan to China to Europe and America, drawing several brave warriors to their calamities' source. Amongst these warriors is Haohmaru, a ronin, who recently left his tutelage from his master, Caffine Nicotine. He sees the foe as a chance to sharpen his swordsmanship. An Ainu priestess, Nakoruru, though a pacifist, takes up her blade to save Mother Nature from further pain. Though several fighters attempt to slay the fiend, these two are successful in defeating him, apparently killing him in the process. Months later, another \"demon\" rises in Japan. However, he is not related to Amakusa or Ambrosia. He is a man named Zankuro Minazuki, a powerful warrior who has earned the label \"demon\" for his merciless slaughter of innocent people, village after village. Zankuro eventually finds the error of his ways and retires to hermitage, only agreeing to kill skillful warriors in duels. One of the victims he spared was a child whom Haohmaru finds and raises. The child's name is Shizumaru Hisame, who seeks revenge for his family's murder under Zankuro's hands. He sets out with Haohmaru to test their strength against Zankuro, challenging other fighters along the way. Eventually, they meet and duel, Shizumaru being the victor. Though Zankuro was heavily wounded, he tries to deliver a final blow only to be struck down by the heavens. He dies complementing the victor and his body is entombed. The grave doesn't last long, as Amakusa revives his efforts for revenge and steals the fallen warrior as an implement for destruction. This time, Amakusa's spirit is split into two halves; the original, good and just; the other, corrupt and ambitious. As the evil half brings destruction to Japan from Shimbara, the good half struggles to restores it. The evil Amakusa kidnaps a young kunoichi named Hazuki from the Kazuma ninja clan. Hazuki, adapt with ki and welding a special life force inside her, is used by the sorcerer to control Zankuro's bloodlust. Her brothers, Kazuki and Sougetsu, race to her rescue. Though several outcomes of this battle are interpreted, Kazuki is officially successful in slaying the evil Amakusa and Zankuro is finally put to rest by Sougetsu. Labeled nukenin, or rogue ninja, by their clan, Hazuki and Kazuki go into hiding while Sougetsu lets them escape. Six months after this conflict, a priestess possessed by the evil demon, Mizuki Rashojin, emerges to send the world into chaos again. Mizuki, as a loyal servant to Ambrosia from 1000 years ago, is awakened by evil from Amakusa's malevolent half. Her awakening causes several worldwide disasters, and though her spirit is awake, she has yet to ascend to the human realm. She preys on unlucky warrior's souls and uses the fallen to strengthen her and Ambrosia's powers. The good Amakusa saves Haohmaru and other virtuous souls but he too falls to her bane. Warriors travel to Hell itself to battle her soul before it resurrects. Haohmaru and Nakoruru are able to make the journey to Hell and stop Mizuki, sealing her into the Makai (demon world) after her defeat. Yuga the Destroyer, another being originating from the Makai realm, moves to conquer the world half a year after Mizuki's defeat. Twenty years prior to Amakusa's resurrection, it enters the human realm and steals various babies from mother's wombs and using its power, bestows superhuman abilities upon them. It silently re-inserts the unborn children, and waits for them to grow into superhuman warriors. Upon their adulthood, it appears before all of them and brainwashed all of them to become its loyal slaves through a magical puppet show. One of its victims is a mysterious woman named Shiki, the perfect female counterpart for Yuga's vessel. Yuga orders Shiki to find the perfect male counterpart, intending to merge the two for its eventual resurrection. Haohmaru is selected but Yuga underestimates him in their battle. Haohmaru defeats it and frees Shiki from its mind-control. A year passes, and Yuga, better prepared, revives itself. With its second appearance, Asura, a destructive being (which wreaks havoc in order to bring about \"the unification of this world and the Netherworld...\") escapes from his prison from the Netherworld. Yuga, realizing the strength of Asura, clones him and creates its loyal servant Hanmen no Asura. His orders are to reclaim Shiki and return to Yuga with her. However, he falls in love with Shiki and turns against his master. Both Asuras defeat Yuga entirely and merge together, leaving Shiki with a child. She leaves the child to Haohmaru's care, feeling unworthy of motherhood. Twenty years pass, with the age of samurai and swordsmen drawing to a close. Those not abiding to the peaceful change of era are outlawed to a prisoner island. Zealous inhabitants rise up and try to create a \"new world exclusively for the chosen ones\", whom are intent on destroying the shogunate. The group they form is called the \"League of the Three Blades of Domination\" and the island becomes known as Ritenkyo. Their leader is an old man named Oboro. A member of the shogunate, Seishiro Kuki, is ordered by his superiors to assassinate the ones responsible for the uprising. An older Haohmaru goes to find his \"niece\", Mikoto, and to free her from her torn past.Games In Other Media Anime/Manga  Additionally, various manhua have been printed for the series. One of them is currently being released in Hong Kong.Drama CDs Pachinko/Pachislot Games Card Game  In December 2006, Sabertooth Games released a Samurai Shodown V collectable card game set along with King of Fighters 2006 for it's Universal Fighting System (UFS) game. UFS is meant to be a universal system, as other games like Street Fighter and Soul Calibur III are also included into the series. Featured character starter decks were also released for Haohmaru and Ukyo Tachibana. STG staff favorites from the Samurai Shodown side tend to favor towards characters Nakoruru and Hanzo Hattori. The series also had a hanafuda deck printed with the series's characters.Characters Introduced in Samurai Shodown II Introduced in Samurai Shodown III Introduced in Samurai Shodown IV Introduced in Samurai Shodown RPG Introduced in Samurai Shodown 64 Introduced in Samurai Shodown 64-2 External Links Terry Bogard  Terry Bogard (\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u30fb\u30dc\u30ac\u30fc\u30c9, Ter\u012b Bog\u0101do) is the main protagonist of the Fatal Fury series. He has appeared in every Fatal Fury and King of Fighters game, and is one of the characters of choice to symbolize the company in crossover games, merchandise and publicity. He appears to fit many Japanese stereotypes for an American character in appearance, personality and speech (his in-game vocabulary is usually limited to American colloquialisms, such as \"Okay!\" and \"Hey, c'mon, c'mon.\"). Terry Bogard is the brother of Andy Bogard. Both of them were orphans adopted by Jeff Bogard. He is often referred to as the Legendary Hungry Wolf (from Garou Densetsu, meaning \"Legend of the Hungry Wolf\"). He has a pet monkey named Ukee (the previous mascot of SNK before Terry). He has a knack for scoring in basketball, which explains the creation of his Power Dunk move. In Gamest's 1997 Heroes Collection, Terry was voted as the staff's eighth favorite character. In Neo Geo Freak's 1997 Volume 8 character poll, he was voted as the fifteenth favourite character with a total of 690 votes. 270 votes from the male fans and 420 votes from the female fans. In a 2005 poll made by SNK Playmore USA, he was voted as the number one fan favorite character with a total of 10014 votes. He was voted as the second most favorite character at the time of Garou: Mark of the Wolves with one commenter saying that \"Terry's the eternal hero\". In the character popularity poll on Neo Geo Freak's website, he was voted as the fourth favorite character with a total of 2,479 votes. At Vigamus, a museum of videogames sponsored by the municipality of Rome, a special illustration lists Terry as the mascot of the early 90's era of Neo Geo.  On Falcoon's SNK 40th anniversary page he states that both Terry and Mai are his favourite SNK characters.Story Fatal Fury The Geese Howard Era  Terry and Andy were orphans who raised themselves on the streets. They were soon adopted by Jeff Bogard and eventually lived in Southtown. When Terry was 10, he witnessed the death of his father at the hands of Geese Howard. Knowing that they needed more training to confront Geese, the brothers made an oath to spend a decade to fine tune their martial arts before trying to avenge their father. Unlike his brother Andy, who left Southtown to train in Japan, Terry chose to wander in his home country, combining the skills learned from his father, his father's mentor Tung Fu Rue, and abilities gained from the streets. A decade later, the crime lord Geese Howard organized a tournament, dubbed The King of Fighters. Terry, Andy and Muay Thai Kickboxing champion Joe Higashi would enter with the purpose of facing Geese. The battle that followed would eventually see Terry defeating Geese, and for some time, it was thought that Geese perished in the battle. The next year saw Geese's half-brother Wolfgang Krauser take control of The King of Fighters, and bringing the once Southtown-only tournament onto the world stage. The finals of this new tournament would again see Terry fighting the sponsor and him ultimately defeating Krauser. During this event, he befriended many of the contestants and became a hero of Southtown. Some time later it was revealed that Geese had survived his encounter with Terry. The Bogards and friends learned of Geese's intentions to retrieve the legendary Jin scrolls, Terry once again challenged and defeated him. Afterwards, Geese fled. Terry faced\u00a0Yamazaki, then challenged the Jin brothers. Standing now as the victor, Terry once again was the champion. However, Geese had escaped with the scrolls. During the next game, Real Bout Fatal Fury, Terry managed to get all the way through the tournament to Geese for one final conflict. At the end of the fight, he knocked Geese off the edge of Geese Tower, but grabbed hold of Geese's hand and tried to keep him from falling. But this was not to be, as Geese knocked Terry's hand away, plummeting to what is believed to be his permanent death. Sometime after their final conflict, Terry encountered a boy by the name of Rock Howard (Geese's son). Taking him in, he would teach him how to fight as they travel together around the world.The Rock Howard Era  After the events of the Real Bout series of Fatal Fury, the story shifts to Second Southtown. Kain R. Heinlein, who was raised in Second South, claimed the city as his own and threatened to throw populace into chaos once more so that people could \"enjoy living\" once more. About 10 years after the events in Real Bout Fatal Fury, the King of Fighters: Maximum Mayhem (hosted and sponsored by Kain) would go underway, and Terry and Rock were invited to take part of the tournament. In Rock Howard's ending, Terry approaches the ruins of a mansion and finds out that Rock is now Kain's partner, and knows that he must trust Rock's decision to stick with Kain for a while. Terry then leaves the vicinity, knowing that Rock has finally left his den. After this, it is presumed Terry resumed his life of the lone wolf, leaving an uncertain future ahead. It is unknown whether Rock's ending is the canon ending, however. In his own ending he wanders Second Southtown thinking about what Kain told him about the nature of humanity. He decides that life is \"all about heart\" and Kain was wrong. Sometime after the Maximum Mayhem tournament, Terry is approached on an off day by Blue Mary on her motorcycle. Discussing over the whereabouts of Rock and the rumors that persist around him regarding the rise of Second Southtown as a city state, he is offered a ride by her to the Pao Pao Cafe, to gloss over the current case she is working on. In his development blog for KOF: Maximum Impact 2, Ureshino states that he doesn't know about Rock's mother or the true inheritor of Geese's legacy but hints that it would most likely conflict with Terry.The King of Fighters  The King of Fighters series reuses the Fatal Fury storyline wherein he receives an invitation to enter a new team fighting tournament called The King of Fighters '94. Since then, Terry has been in many installments as team captain of Team Fatal Fury. Though the team's roster has changed through the years, Terry has always been present. He also has a rivalry with Ryo which is mostly exclusive to this series. His reasons for joining each tournament in the early entries tends to center on Terry's concerns with Geese's possible involvement. His possible death was played on during The King of Fighters '99 where he stayed behind in the collapsing NESTS's base. He didn't contact with any of his friends or loved ones until a year later. In his time of absence, Terry tracked down NESTS's men who were targeting Mary. He decides to help her out in her job by teaming up with her in the 2000 and 2001 tournaments. He organizes his teams with various members in the following years, being the one to ask Tizoc in 2003 and Duck King into the team for KOF XI. To catch up and to reunite the legendary trio of Southtown, he joins up with his brother and Joe once more in KOF XIII. Before their meeting, he had to endure a long journey back to the city and fell asleep at the station. He calls up Mary to give him a ride to Paopao Cafe, and he cheerfully arrives over 30 minutes late. His tardiness and usual attitude for any tournament upsets Joe, who knows that he and Andy have their own responsibilities besides the tournament. Although Terry doesn't understand why his friend is upset, he has a sparring match with him in Paopao Cafe. Knowing that his fan, Alice, and Geese will be participating the new tournament, Terry joins to oversee her progress along with taking his usual vigilance regarding Geese.SNK Heroines  Terry's female appearance in the game is implied to be all a nightmare, including one scene where Rock Howard kicks him off the Geese Tower in a reimagined ending scene from Real Bout Fatal Fury. All these dissipates as Rock wakes him up for breakfast.Personality  Terry Bogard is an incredibly charismatic, cheerful and friendly man with everyone around him. He bears no ill will towards anyone other than Geese Howard, the killer of his adoptive father. His relationship with Andy is that of respect, recognizing his younger brother as his fiercest rival. He feels a sense of kinship with Blue Mary for her loss, and the two developed a long time relationship. He treats Rock as his son, but allows him to choose his own path in life. He teasingly calls Rock, \"Rookie\". Terry is also well-informed of what goes on in the streets.Powers Skills Fighting Style  Terry uses a mixture of boxing, karate, kung fu, kickboxing and street fighting moves to create a very unique fighting style, mixed in with chi techniques learned from his Hakkyokuseiken master, Tung Fu Rue. He had also learned martial arts directly from his adoptive father, Jeff Bogard. Other sources state his fighting experience was also gained from brawling on the streets for years to hone proper techniques for himself, where he tested out varying methods of fighting to his tastes. Terry is an all-around fighter, with extensive knowledge of many martial arts techniques. He uses many variations of punches, such as hooks and uppercuts and can also kick with ease. A majority of his techniques have a \"power naming\" motif, via Power Wave, Power Drive, Power Shoot and Power Geyser. Two of his signature moves, the Crack Shoot and Power Dunk, were inspired by Terry's love for basketball, in which the latter move was enhanced in The King of Fighters XIV and was renamed the \"Star Dunk Volcano\". In later years, Terry also developed a technique that ties into his wolf motif, named the Buster Wolf. He also in a few instances, creates a technique that has the same input scheme as Geese's Deadly Rave (as a possible tribute), known as the Rising Beat, which first debuted in SvC Chaos. Terry also pays tribute to Geese's son Rock by having his own version of his stronger-version Shine Knuckle, the Rising Force (which acts as his HSDM/MAX2DM). His well-rounded style also carries onward into his playstyle, where he has very well-rounded normal attacks and is a very basic character to play. However, one notable downside is that his special moves are all very laggy, forcing him to play a bit carefully when it comes to trying to land big damage.Music Image Songs Voice Actors Live Action Actors Game Appearances Mobile Appearances Cameo Appearances Anime Appearances Similar Characters See also Trivia References Ash Crimson  Ash Crimson (\u30a2\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30fb\u30af\u30ea\u30e0\u30be\u30f3, Asshu Kurimuzon) is the protagonist of the Ash Saga; his first appearance is in The King of Fighters 2003 as the leader of the New Hero Team. His official nickname is Sneering Firelight (\u5632\u7b11\u3046 \u706b\u5f71, Azawarau Hokage)  or The Sneering Blaze.Development  Ash was designed with the intent of creating an \"attractive evil character\" with little changes done to him since conception. During the initial planning stage for Ash, developers wanted to create a protagonist that has never been done for the franchise. Following this idea, they decided to create a feminine-looking and unheroic character to contrast the impact from the previous protagonists. Falcoon adds that the main goal for Ash was to make him an ambiguous hero that purposely makes players \"feel bad\" for cheering for him. Ash's character design was not made by Falcoon \u2014some of the development sketches for Ash's final design look closer to Nona's style. However, Falcoon did add extra details to Ash while illustrating him to better fit his character. KOF Maximum Impact: Regulation A earned its title for three reasons: arcade, arrange, and Ash. In a later interview, Falcoon relates that he asked permission from the 2D team to borrow Ash for the game.Story Tales of Ash  Ash is the descendant of Saiki. When he was living in France, he spent his childhood years with Elisabeth Blanctorche. For reasons still not entirely divulged, he left her household and the Blanctorche teachings. He enters the 2003 edition of The King of Fighters tournament alongside Duo Lon and Shen Woo. While his teammates leave him to solve their own vendettas, Ash goes to the Orochi seal where Kyo, Chizuru, and Iori are investigating. Ash ambushes a weakened Chizuru, robs her powers, and leaves her unconscious. He taunts that Iori will be next before fleeing from the scene. For KOF XI, he enters the next tournament with Shen and Oswald. After the tournament's events, he reveals to Oswald that Shen is the target he has been contracted to assassinate, a set up that Ash had in place before the tournament occurred. After leaving his teammates to fight amongst themselves, Ash takes advantage of Iori's unstable Riot of the Blood state to steal the Yasakani Jewel. Before he leaves the tournament grounds, Elisabeth Blanctorche and her team appears before him. She accuses Ash of abandoning \"their mission\" and fighting for personal gain. To intimidate her, he unleashes his new purple flames and disappears using the Yata Mirror. He warns them that Kyo is next. Prior to the KOF XIII tournament, Ash openly joins forces with Those from the Past and works for their master. During the tournament finals, his true motives are revealed: his previous actions were done to earn Saiki's trust and to gain enough power to rob Saiki's soul. He wants to end their bloodline. Ash carries out his true plan when Saiki finally lowers his guard, but Saiki's essence overwhelms him. After being defeated again by the winning team, Ash regains control of his body. Saiki insists that Ash enter the Time Gate, which will allow them to return to a previous era and begin their entire plan over again. Since Ash likes the current world, he allows the gate to close. His inaction erases both him and Saiki from time. Ash has a few moments to apologize to Elisabeth before disappearing. He leaves the stolen sacred treasures behind for Iori and Chizuru to reclaim.XIV Arc  Ash Crimson's act of erasing Saiki (and consequentially, his own self) from existence by orchestrating a temporal paradox (by trapping Saiki in the present time) sets up the events in the game, and resulted in the appearance of the entity known as Verse. After Verse's defeat, Ash's soul is released and is found by Kukri and Elisabeth on Carpathian Mountains in Ukraine. It is then highly implied, if not outright confirmed, that Ash is alive again.Personality  Ash is a cunning, self righteous, and flamboyant individual. Confident in his own powers, he doesn't take things too seriously and considers things that are of no interest bothersome. Even when faced with serious situations, he is calm and somewhat blas\u00e9. He isn't one who considers working with others, but instead uses others to achieve his goals. He tends to flaunt the superiority of his halfhearted effort and speaks in a playful and condescending manner, which often irritates the characters he is speaking to. He views Elisabeth as his older sister figure, and notes that she is \"too serious\". He feels that Duo Lon and Shen Woo are his good friends, although he appeared to them with mysterious intentions. He also has a habit of calling people pet names such as \"Betty\" for Elisabeth, and \"Ozzy\" for Oswald. His personality seems to slightly change when actively using the power of the Yasakani jewel. Usually calm and composed, when using his Fructidor move, Ash will laugh maniacally while making his opponent burn with the purple flames of the Yasakani. This behaviour is similar to Iori, and it may be interpreted as Orochi's taint affecting his mind.Powers Fighting Style  Ash fights using an acrobatic style combined with fire abilities to give a graceful fighting style. Despite his stature, he is extremely powerful. He is a good character for people who like to zone and poke their opponents, but he also has many other tools at the player's disposal that can be used to rush down efficiently, all while keeping the pressure on them. In KoF13, he also employs Iori's and Chizuru's powers into his moveset. Most of his moves refer to the French Revolution; they are named after months of the French Republican Calendar. His fighting style in general is similar to the French martial art of Savate.\u00a0Music Voice Actors Game Appearances Mobile Appearances Cameo Appearances Anime Appearances Similar Characters See also Trivia References The King of Fighters  The King of Fighters (\u30b6\u30fb\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u30fb\u30aa\u30d6\u30fb\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u30ba, Za Kingu Obu Fait\u0101zu), officially abbreviated KOF, is the most prominent series of fighting games by SNK. Its claim to fame is the large cast of characters and the innovative \"team\" system, with both original designs and characters from other SNK games. The series was originally developed for SNK's Neo Geo video game systems, which would continue until SNK retired the Neo Geo completely in 2004. For the next few games, the Atomiswave would be used, and later the Taito Type X2. Aside from this, ports of the arcade games and original The King of Fighters games have been released for the various consoles of then and now, such as SNK's own Neo Geo Pocket, the Game Boy and Game Boy Advance, the Sega Saturn and the Dreamcast, the PlayStation and Xbox series of consoles, and even the N-Gage, among others. The latest main game in the series, The King of Fighters XIV, was released on August 23, 2016 for PlayStation 4, and on June 15, 2017 for Steam.Overview  The first game in the series, The King of Fighters '94, was released by SNK in 1994. The game was designed to be a dream match of characters from the company's various arcade titles, particularly Fatal Fury, Art of Fighting, Ikari Warriors, and Psycho Soldier. The success of the game lead to SNK to release yearly installments of the series and numbered the games for the year they were released. With yearly sports games, each new version is meant to be an \"update\"; SNK did differently, making each year unique with new rules and a constantly changing character rosters even to this day. By 2004, SNK abandoned yearly releases of the series and usually numbered future games in a more traditional manner: the first main series game released as such was The King of Fighters XI. In 2004, SNK produced the first 3D installment of the series, KOF: Maximum Impact. The game and its two sequels use an alternate story for characters and settings from previous games of the series, leaning more towards the South Town-based series like FF and AOF. The producer of the Maximum Impact series, Falcoon, stated that the Maximum Impact games are in a different canon from the original series of games. The King of Fighters tournament, the namesake of this series, actually originated in Fatal Fury, a classic SNK fighting game that predated the KOF series. The later Art of Fighting was centered around an earlier iteration, featuring typical sponsor Geese Howard in a younger self. The King of Fighters games have had a number of villains as their individual end bosses. The first of these was Rugal Bernstein in  '94  who had a tendency to submerge his defeated foes in liquid metal, turning them into grisly trophies commemorating his victories. During the Orochi saga, Orochi is introduced as an ominous force from ancient times bent on revenge on those who imprisoned it and was aided by his four heralds. In later games, a mysterious organization called NESTS attempts to kidnap and succeeds in cloning Kyo Kusanagi in hopes of using his power to take over the world. The leader of NESTS, who called himself Igniz, hoped to amass enough power to become a god. Other villains in later games include Mukai and \"Those from the Past\" that he affiliates himself with, including Magaki, as well as the Mephistopheles group (Maximum Impact series). In order to preserve their characters' images, SNK ceased to age their characters since The King of Fighters '95 and they have remained the same ages since then. This means that characters introduced in The King of Fighters '94 have only aged one year in the series. To stay true to this theme, newer characters following this year also keep the same age they have when introduced. Some concessions to age and the passing of time exist, though, such as Terry's switch to his Garou outfit, or Kyo no longer being in high school since 1998. Ages have stopped being officially listed since KOF XI, likely to avoid confusion amongst fans.Games Other Media Comics Drama CDs Film and Animation Card Game  In December 2006, Sabertooth Games released a King of Fighters 2006 collectible card game set along with Samurai Shodown V for it's Universal Fighting System (UFS) game. Other games like Street Fighter and Soul Calibur III are also included into the series. Character started packs were released for Terry Bogard, Mai Shiranui, and eventually Rock Howard. Another trading card game was printed by the company Weib Shwarz on June 28, 2009. It's part of a campaign that allows collectors to exchange premium points for CDs and other collectibles.Pachinko Games  Three pachinko slot games were developed for the series. One follows the Orochi saga (The King of Fighters) and the other follows the NESTS saga (The King of Fighters 2). The newest one (Maximum Impact) focuses on the series's 3D titles. A fourth slot game (The King of Fighters III) covers the Ash saga. These machines remain exclusive to Japan.Mobile Games Characters Introduced in The King of Fighters '94  Brought from other games:Introduced in The King of Fighters '95  Brought from other games:Introduced in The King of Fighters '96  Brought from other games:Introduced in The King of Fighters '97  Brought from other games:Introduced in The King of Fighters: Kyo Introduced in The King of Fighters '99  Brought from other games:Introduced in The King of Fighters '99 Evolution Introduced in The King of Fighters EX Introduced in The King of Fighters 2000  Brought from other games:Introduced in The King of Fighters EX2 Introduced in The King of Fighters 2001 Introduced in The King of Fighters 2002 Introduced in The King of Fighters 2003  Brought from other games:Introduced in KOF: Maximum Impact  Brought from other games:Introduced in KOF: Maximum Impact 2  Brought from other games:Introduced in KOF Maximum Impact Regulation A  Brought from other games:Introduced in The King of Fighters 2002 Unlimited Match Introduced in The King of Fighters XII  Brought from other games:Introduced in The King of Fighters XIII  Brought from other games:Introduced in The King of Fighters XIV  Brought from other games:External Links K'  K' (K' (\u30b1\u30a4\u30fb\u30c0\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5), Kei Dasshu, pronounced as \"K Dash\"), sometimes known as \"K Prime\", is a character who debuted as the leader of the Hero Team in The King of Fighters '99. He stars as the reluctant hero in the NESTS saga of the series, often letting his partner Maxima handle any social necessities in his stead. To contrast the previous protagonist of the series, K' was made to be the \"dark hero\". His official nickname is He who surpasses K (K \u3092 \u8d85\u3048\u308b \u3082\u306e, K wo Koeru mono). In a 2005 poll made by SNK-Playmore USA, he was voted as the fourth fan favorite character with a total of 338 votes. In an interview with one of the manhua artist and authors, King Tung, he replies that K' is his favorite original character in the series.Development  The origins of both K\u2032 and Maxima can be found in the Psikyo arcade game The Fallen Angels (\u5815\u843d\u5929\u4f7f, Daraku Tenshi in Japan). This obscure 1998 release stars an emaciated goth in tight leather pants named Cool, along with a brawny, cybernetically enhanced US Marine named Harry Ness. The man responsible for the design of both characters, Shin'ichi Morioka, migrated to SNK shortly after The Fallen Angels was released, and elements of Cool and Harry Ness' design were used in the creation of K\u2032 and Maxima. The end result is that K\u2032 looks nearly identical to Cool. The idea of K' wearing shades was taken by another Fallen Angel character named Haiji Mibu. His namesake was taken from a clone character in the light novel Blue Knight Berserga Monogatari (\u9752\u306e\u9a0e\u58eb\u30d9\u30eb\u30bc\u30eb\u30ac\u7269\u8a9e), which is set in the same universe as the anime series Armored Trooper Votoms. During the early phases of development of The King of Fighters '99, K\u2032's introduction to the series was meant to remove popular characters Kyo Kusanagi and Iori Yagami from the roster, though this idea was later scrapped. C.A.C Yamasaki predicted that K' would be popular on his release, however this prediction never came true, in an interview he comments that K' was \"a little too plain.\" K' would later receive a slight redesign on his hair due to the protagonist of Garou: Mark of the Wolves looking just like K'. This caused the supervising designer to panic after realizing this.Story NESTS Saga  K' (real name unknown) was a normal child who lived happily with his sister, Seirah. One day, they were captured by NESTS, a crime syndicate who dealt with drugs, genetics, robotics and biotechnology. K' was kept under NESTS and trained to be some kind of weapon. In 1998, K' was made to participate in the Kusanagi cloning program. He was infused with Kyo Kusanagi's DNA, which gave him the power of pyrokinesis. During the program, K's memory was tinkered with, and he was made to believe that he was Krizalid's clone. Any real memories from his past has either been erased by NESTS, forgotten, or repressed. Under NESTS orders, he and Maxima joined the King of Fighters tournament with Benimaru Nikaido and Shingo Yabuki. The team makes it to the finals and are sent to a place where Krizalid waits for them. He poses as the tournament's host and fights them to gather their battle data energy. He hoped to use the data to activate the thousands of listless Kyo clones around the globe. However, K' defeats him and the team learns that Krizalid was merely a pawn for NESTS. Shortly afterward, Krizalid is executed by his superior. When the base collapses, K' and Maxima are divided from their team and hunted down by the Ikari squad. They survive the ambush and continue their resistance by leaving the organization. K's personal reason for doing so is find a way to regain his lost memories. The next year, K' and Maxima were joined by mercenaries Vanessa and Ramon. They entered the tournament to discover NESTS scheme, but Vanessa and Ramon were there to capture K' and Maxima at the end of the tournament, since they were working for Ling and Heidern. Their team makes it to the finals where they encounter Zero. Although K' defeats the traitor, they are unable to stop the Zero Cannon from firing. Unknown to them, Kula Diamond and her team destroy it and save the world from further damage. K' and Maxima are once again separated from their teammates after the tournament's climax. Whip finds them, reveals her relation to K', and joins their resistance effort. They spend the remainder of the year hunting down NESTS's bases around the globe. Though they have stumped some of the syndicate's plans, none of the bases were the main headquarters they were hoping for. K' and company enter the 2001 tournament with Lin, who tracked their movements in his personal hunt for Ron. Once his team makes it to the finals, they are lifted into a spaceship and are confronted by the real Zero. He reveals to the frustrated K' that they are on their way to the syndicate's main headquarters and will meet the real leader to NESTS. Once they reach the satellite, they meet Nests, Misty, and Igniz. Although Nests requests their neutral cooperation, he is quickly killed by Igniz. There, they learn that they are merely cyborgs (or clones) purely created for Igniz's personal entertainment (i.e. to become a new god). K' faces the villain and with some assistance from his team defeats him, which motivates Igniz to kamikaze the satellite to Earth. It harmlessly falls in the ocean - apparently thanks to Ron - with most of its passengers safe. Emerging from the wreck, K' forms an alliance with Kula and Diana. Both of them want to make their own future and make up for the time lost in their lives.Ash Saga  In 2003, Chin Gentsai visits K' and Maxima and requests that they enter the tournament. Chin, feeling a dark wave of energy around KOF that year, wants them to investigate it in his place. K' and company locate and face Mukai. K' Team defeats him, but K' was bothered by his taunts about regaining his memories, as well as reaching his true potential. Mukai's words continue to haunt him in the following tournament, leading K' to wonder if he can surpass his fate as \"the second Kusanagi flame\". At the end of the XI tournament, K' and his teammates were invited by Heidern to attend a lecture about the mysterious group known as Those from the Past. Heidern said he had Magaki's body, but they were attacked by two children who took the body away. K' had absolutely no interest in entering the KOF XIII tournament, and is upset when Chin calls him once more at his apartment with Maxima. Since he soon learns from Chin and Kula that they're in the newest tournament, K' is forced to enter against his own will. In their ending, the team spend their vacation on a cruise ship; Maxima told K' to enjoy the fun, but the latter didn't seem interested, while Kula seems to have more fun, making a giant splash around the pool, washing other people ashore. Maxima orders a big ice cream treat in a giant glass cup with many cones around, despite his eatery for sweets, and manages to finish it off. After that, agents appear out nowhere in the cruise, and the 3 prepare to fight the agents with the power of NESTS.XIV Arc  After the events of the previous tournament, the majority of their wanted posters had now been taken down in exchange for their strategic aid to Heidern and his forces. While this ended their status as suspected terrorist fugitives, it did not put an end to the shadowy organizations pursuing them. After K' and Maxima dealt with the pursuers, Kula contacts the duo, passing on a message related to former members of NESTS participating in the upcoming KOF tournament. In their ending, they were ordered to attend Heiderns meeting to pass on information related to Verse. Once K', Maxima and Kula board the helicopter Maxima informs his partner that several bodies have emerged from the fragments of Verse and that some of those bodies have records from previous competitions while some have no records at all.Personality  K' has a very serious and arrogant\u00a0personality but is very easy to enrage due to his more high-strung side. He is starting to treat Whip as a big sister and Kula as a little sister. He often calls Maxima names - like \"stupid\", \"idiot\", etc. - but he actually trusts his partner's reliability. He is hardly polite and is always gruff, even to those close to him. Because K' usually expresses his concerns in a \"tough guy\" manner, Maxima jokingly calls him dishonest or stiff. He sees Kyo as a rival and wants to prove he is better than him, not as only a clone. In KOF XIII, several fighters often point out K's rather immature personality (\"whiny\", lazy, anti-social and constantly rude to others) in their pre-fight dialogues against him. It is also pointed out he feels trapped in his life and is also rather very lazy and hates involving himself in most things he finds trivial, making him not unlike Iori Yagami in terms of nihilistic mindset (and the two ironically very much hate each other and are prone to nasty dialogue between one another for little reason). He, of course, despite his disinterest to partake in the KOF tournaments, at times often boasts about his abilities to take on anyone anytime, anywhere, which is something not quite far off from his capabilities as he also finds engaging in tasks with expected results to be yet another chore.Powers Fighting Style  K's fighting style is said to be \"Pure Violence\", but it has several similarities with Bruce Lee's Jeet Kune Do. He even uses some of his famous moves, such as the One inch punch and Flying Kicks. As a nod to hinting of said \"violence\", K's moves tend to show very brutal mannerisms due to his high-strung nature. This ranges from violent elbow strikes, enraged battle cries, and even resorting to throw his sunglasses at his foe and following up with a beatdown, no holds barred. Most of his mannerisms are either somewhat lazy (due to his disinterest in fighting), even to dozing off in battle via his idle stance when a certain amount of time passes; some/most of his flames tend to come from his right hand due to his limitations, but K' can work around this handicap in combat regardless, and is regarded as one of the best fighters in the KOF universe (as well as a high/top tier character in terms of gameplay in more later installments of the series). Despite his laziness, K' is shown to also be rather flexible (evidenced by his pre-KOF XI blowback attack, Second Shell, Minutes Spike, and Crow Bites Plus/classic jumping strong kick). His HSDM/MAX2DM, Crimson Star Road, is named after an episode of the anime series Legend of Galactic Heroes.Music Voice Actors Game Appearances Mobile Appearances Cameo Appearances Anime Appearances Similar Characters See Also Trivia References Athena Asamiya  Athena Asamiya (\u9ebb\u5bae \u30a2\u30c6\u30ca, Asamiya Atena) is a character originally from Psycho Soldier and a distant relative and modern-day counterpart of Princess Athena from Athena. She later appears as a regular fighter in The King of Fighters series; she is perhaps best known for changing her outfit and hair style for virtually every main installment. She stars in her own ADV game Athena: Awakening from the Ordinary Life that was only released in Japan for the Sony PlayStation in 1999. Athena was a highly anticipated character for the King of Fighters lineup and developers relate that they are constantly working to keep her in the series. Throughout the years, her sailor uniform outfit was a frequent request from Japanese fans that was denied due to the belief that it wouldn't translate well with the overseas audience (this kept up until recent installments). Her official nickname is The Psychic-Powered Idol.Nona, one of the series designers, reply that Athena is his favorite original character in the series. In the Neo Geo Freak's 1997 Volume 8 character poll, she was voted as the eighth favourite character with a total of 1,139 votes. 833 votes from the male fans and 306 votes from the female fans. In the character popularity poll on Neo Geo Freak's website, she was voted as the tenth favorite character with a total of 1,020 votes.Story  Athena is a modern day high school girl in Japan. She teamed up with her friend, Sie Kensou, to fight in the name of justice. In Psycho Soldiers, she was one of the \"heroes of light\" who defended the world from the Shiguma forces. Her psychic powers are believed to be transmigrated to her rather than inherited by her family. As such, she is sometimes referred to as the resurrected Athena who is gifted with esper-like powers.Orochi Saga  In the King of Fighters series, she is a student of Kensou's Kenpo teacher, Chin Gentsai. She has spent most of her life secluded in China's mountains training. Her team participates in the tournaments as a form of training and to save the populace from an apparent future threat. Other times, they enter to disrupt any evil forces they may feel at the time. In the 1996 tournament, Chin seemed perturbed by the energy he sensed and didn't want his students to be involved with it. However, they surprise him by redoubling their enthusiasm for the event and they enter. Their success in the tournament is shown in the following year where they receive a mountain of adoring fan letters. Athena in particular had a boost in popularity and stardom. However, Chin rejects their proposal to enter King of Fighters since he doesn't want his students to forget the purpose of their training. Determined to change his mind, Athena presents him with an inspirational letter from Kaoru Watabe. The contents in the letter helps her argument that their publicity moves people to do better things, which is essentially another way of saving people. Convinced that his students are improving, he allows them to enter once more. In the aftermath of KOF '97, the Psycho Soldiers meet Kaoru, who now travels with them to most of their engagements and was even a striker in KOF 2000.NESTS Saga  By this time in the series, Athena becomes a famous pop-star who is rising the charts with her concerts. She welcomes the new recruit, Bao, warmly and hopes that he does his best. Additionally, she grows concerned for Kensou once he lost his powers though she remains optimistic that they might return during the tournament on a spur-of-the-moment notice. Her team's backstory in The King of Fighters 99 reveals that the team was there during the collapse of NESTS's base in the finals. During that time, Athena was caught underneath the falling rubble and passed out. Though he has no memory of it, Kensou saved her with a formidable latent energy. Ever since then, Bao suffered from a mysterious fatigue and illness. This same energy is later revealed to be the \"Dragon's Spirit\". Though she has her doubts with her master's methods, she wearily agrees to join the tournaments in this saga to treat Bao and Kensou's predicament. In the team's story in The King of Fighters 2000 she, Chin and Kaoru Watabe witness Bao's near heroic sacrifice as he takes a the NESTS satellite's energy beam to protect them, and how this leads to Kensou recovering his powers when he absorbs the rest of the energy.Ash Saga  For the first time since the beginning of KOF, the Psycho Soldiers did not enter the tournament in KOF 2003 since Kensou and Bao went on a year long training mission with Chin to master Kensou's unreliable \"Dragon's Spirit\". Not wanting to miss out on her annual fix of tournament competition, Athena joined forces with Hinako Shijou and Malin to form the High School Girls team, a strange but rather successful partnership. For KOF XI, Athena reunites with Kensou after his year of training, and Momoko, one of Athena's fans with psychic capabilities.Personality  Athena is very outgoing, polite, and friendly. A happy girl with righteous virtues and well-meaning morals, she treasures her fans and those who are helpless\u00a0and\u00a0strives to\u00a0do her best to fight for them, though she can be a bit of a crybaby at times.\u00a0 Athena often chides Kensou for slacking off in his training. She either is well aware of his crush on her, but usually chooses to ignore his romantic advances since he seems to embarrass her, or she is oblivious about his romantic interest in her.\u00a0Powers Skills Fighting Style  Athena was taught Kung Fu by Chin Gentsai, probably the style of Wing Chun. Her stance was loosely based on Liuhebafa. While Athena is a capable hand-to-hand fighter, she mostly relies on her psychic powers to fight. Athena is not feared for her martial arts training, but she is respected and can somewhat hold her own against some fighters. Athena's fighting style revolves mostly around simple yet effective strikes, and around speed and acrobacies, rather than strength. She uses her psychic powers to full effectiveness when in combat, improving her martial capabilities, controlling the battlefield and getting the enemy off guard with several surprise tactics.Music Image Songs Voice Actors Live Action Actors Game Appearances Mobile Appearances Cameo Appearances Anime Appearances Similar Characters See also References Kula Diamond  Kula Diamond (\u30af\u30fc\u30e9\u30fb\u30c0\u30a4\u30a2\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9, K\u016bra Daiamondo) first appeared as the sub-boss in The King of Fighters 2000. She enters as a normal participant in subsequent appearances. Her original hair color is strawberry blonde (confirmed after the game's release), but changes to a light blue when she activates her powers. She's often seen with her companions, Diana, Foxy and Candy Diamond. Her official nickname is Ice Doll (\u30a2\u30a4\u30b9 \u30c9\u30fc\u30eb, Aisu d\u014dru). At Vigamus, a museum of videogames sponsored by the municipality of Rome, a special illustration lists Kula as the mascot of the new millennium era of Neo Geo.Development  She was designed to be the antagonistic foil to K', in an attempt to better develop characteristics of the NESTS cartel. She was specially made with attempts to depict a 14-year-old girl with \"appropriately girlish\" gestures with help from the newly hired female staff. Her actual design was left to the veteran supervising designer.Story  Kula Diamond is a being created with the codename Anti-K by NESTS to exterminate the cartel's traitor, K'. She possesses the same design as K', and her clothes are almost identical to K's, with DNA altered to use ice powers instead. As a side effect of her surgery, her mental state has been turned back to that of a child. Despite the fact that their subject was a mindless puppet with no sign of emotions (aside from being an innocent young girl), the NESTS cartel was not willing to repeat the same mistake they made with K'. Therefore, NESTS created an android called Candy Diamond, who would monitor Kula's behavior and assure that Kula would accomplish her missions, providing assistance in battle if she was needed. NESTS also assigned two of their top agents (Diana and Foxy) to supervise and prevent any sort of betrayal by Kula. She is often ordered by either Diana or Foxy to exterminate other traitors to NESTS -such as Zero or Igniz- but has been known to disobey her orders for the sake of others, such as the destruction of the Zero Cannon. After NESTS's destruction, she allies herself on friendly terms with her target, K' and his companions, understanding that both their lives were ruined by NESTS. Whip affectionately refers to her as the \"little sister\" of the group. Prior to the KOF XIII tournament, she was staying with K' and Maxima at their apartment. She became cellphone buddies with Chin Gentsai, who promised that she would get a lot of ice cream if she entered the tournament with her comrades. With Whip asking her to do the same, she entered herself and her teammates in the KOF XIII tournament. In the Maximum Impact series, Kula accepts to enter in the tournament to search for Dr. Makishima under the orders of Heidern, as the doctor is needed to repair Maxima's failing nuclear core. During the tournament, she finds a rival in the form of Nagase, and defeats her, with the latter swearing revenge for the humiliation she suffered. Kula eventually discovers that the doctor had been taken elsewhere, and leaves the tournament.Personality  Before being a killer, Kula is a child. While working for NESTS or for Diana and Foxy, she would not fail to kill anyone she finds unworthy. During her time with NESTS, her feelings were repressed, as she was portrayed as a cold girl executing her mission. She has since been defrosted into being more childish as of late. Kula is trying hard to establish herself as a humane person, so people don't look at her as if she is some kind of weapon, she doesn't use her powers to full extend so she doesn't kill anyone by accident, because she fears that it would make her go back to her previous ways, so she prefers close combat instead. After beating her opponents Kula is usually worried about them. Despite being this sweet innocent girl, Kula has some anger management issues. They are mostly the results of people either talking down to her, underestimating her, or reminding her of her origins and calling her a weapon. She also gets angry when she sees flames.Powers Fighting Style  As the Anti-K', her fighting style is primarily based on K's (with her sharing his One-inch punch being a prime example), but adapted to her ice-based powers. She also fights using her ice skates, which are able to cut easily through flesh. She has high flexibility, which allows her to kick high and with ease, so she can use her skates to their full extent. Kula is very acrobatic and agile, mostly relying on her speed and ice powers rather than brutal strength, though she still can concentrate her strength on a single hit. Some of her moves (such as One Inch Punch) can send characters as big as Chang Koehan flying across the stage. Some of her moves also resemble ice dancing. She also employs the help of her friends, Foxy, Candy and Diana, primarily the latter.Music Voice Actors Game Appearances Mobile Appearances Cameo Appearances Anime Appearances See also Trivia References Leona  Leona (\u30ec\u30aa\u30ca, Reona), also known under her codename Leona Heidern (\u30ec\u30aa\u30ca\u30fb\u30cf\u30a4\u30c7\u30eb\u30f3, Reona Haiderun), is a character introduced in The King of Fighters '96 as the new member to the Ikari Team. Before production for her debut game began, developers wanted to create a suitable replacement for Heidern as a part of the game's overhaul. Leona was conceived to be an Orochi descendant by the time of her debut and her designers took special care to let their interests at the time reflect in her actions.  Her official nickname is The Silent Soldier (\u30b5\u30a4\u30ec\u30f3\u30c8 \u30bd\u30eb\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc). In an interview with one of the series designers, Shinkiro, he replies that Leona is his favorite original character in the series. Logo and character designer Nao Q also has Leona as his favourite character, he comments on his soft spot for ice maidens.Garou: Mark of the Wolves planner and The King of Fighters XIV producer Yasuyuki Oda states that Leona and Kyo are his favourite characters in The King of Fighters series. In the Neo Geo Freak's 1997 Volume 8 character poll, she was voted as the fourth favourite character with a total of 1,458 votes. 187 votes from the male fans and 1,271 votes from the female fans. Aside from the main body of the King of Fighters series, Leona is also featured in a one-shot chapter in the spin-off manga, The King of Fighters: Kyo and has her own character image album.Story Orochi Saga  Leona was born in an unnamed village, residing with her family. When she was a child, Goenitz arrived at her home and demanded to talk with Gaidel, the leader of the village. He requested that Gaidel join him in their duties to serve Orochi, as everyone in the village were Orochi bloodline members. However, Gaidel refused as he and his family liked peace and not the violent tendencies created by the Orochi blood. Enraged, Goenitz leaves; the same night, Leona underwent the Riot of Blood and slaughtered everyone in the village. Goenitz, pleased by the results, puts her blood lust to rest for another time \"when he needs her again\". Dazed and shocked, she loses her memories and wanders aimlessly until she is found and later adopted by Heidern. Surprised by her natural fighting ability, he decides to raise her as a Ikari warrior under his command. In 1996, she receives her first official mission to enter the King of Fighters tournament with Ralf and Clark. Their mission was to investigate Geese Howard who had entered the tournament in search of an unknown goal. During the events of the '96 finals, Goenitz confronts her and reminds her of her Orochi lineage, causing her to worry about the future. Her troubled state carried over to the battlefield, which eventually lead to her and her partners' suspension from military service. Wanting to cheer her up, Ralf enlists them again in the the next year's tournament. She eventually remembers her past fully during the events of King of Fighters '97. Towards the tournament finals, Leona undergoes the Riot of the Blood induced by Orochi. By the tournament's end, she is successfully subdued and Orochi is sealed away. Even so, Leona regrets her actions and attempts to end her life. Ralf stops her, and encourages her to continue living.NESTS Saga  Leona stays as a member of Ikari team for each and every King of Fighters tournaments during the NESTS saga. It was assumed she partook in her normal duties with Heidern during this time frame.Ash Saga  At the end of the tournament in 2003, Orochi's seal is broken. She enters the Riot of the Blood and attacks Ralf and Clark, badly injuring them. She is pulled out of the team by Heidern in The King of Fighters XI due to the emotional trauma she suffered after the incident. Overcoming the shock, she is designated to join the KOF XIII tournament with her old teammates, determined to live with whatever flaws the Orochi blood invokes. After the tournament's climax, she loses consciousness and sleeps for several days. Her teammates were worried for her and stay beside her until she awakens. Comforted by their concerns, she laughs for the first time in the series.Personality  Leona is a reticent individual who has trouble expressing herself outside of combat or a mission. Due to her past, she often keeps her emotions in check as she is afraid of losing control and hurting her friends because of her Orochi blood. Aside from Ralf, Whip, Clark and Commander Heidern, Leona does not talk to anyone. She often feels lonely, but is comforted with the new family she has found with the Ikari mercenaries. Ever since the attempted suicide, Leona resolves to take control of her own Orochi blood, using it only when the situation calls for it, something that she tells her opponents in her own pre-fight dialogues.Powers Fighting Style  She shares several moves with her adoptive father, Heidern, and she also seems to emulate Ralf's moves. For example; her CD/Blowback attack is almost akin to Ralf's. Also as the games progress, her moves seem to become more explosive much like Ralf's and her style of running changing from being like Heidern's to like Ralf's, but at the same time still maintaining her more agile techniques taught by Heidern; unlike Heidern however, she has more apparent differences in her techniques via extra variations that focus more on speed and acrobatics. The V-shaped slashmarks that appear at the end of her V-Slasher DM and SDM are an homage to Choudenji Machine Voltes V -- the titular giant robot had an attack in which it made a V-shaped slash through the enemy, leaving a glowing V for a few dramatic moments before it is destroyed. Her Rebel Spark Desperation Move and Super Desperation Move where she plants an explosive on her opponent then moving away from the opponent while making a pose, is actually a homage to Kamen Rider Black RX -- a Japanese tokusatsu show where the hero impaled his enemy with his sword, Revolcane, and proceed to do the same pose as sparks came out from his opponent's belly and eventually exploded. Also, her jumping CD/Blowback attack resembles Kamen Rider Black's version of the Rider Kick, owing to the sudden, unexplained glow of reddish energy around her foot, and being performed while in the air. Another sentai homage includes her exploding earrings (Himitsu Sentai Goranger). The air throw\u00a0she shares with Heidern\u00a0(Heidern/Leona Inferno)\u00a0takes its name and appearance from Kinnikuman Zebra's \"Muscle Inferno\" attack\u00a0in Kinnikuman. Two of her moves are\u00a0references to JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Her other moves take their namesakes from Grendizer.Music Voice Actors Game Appearances Mobile Appearances Cameo Appearances Anime Appearances Similar Characters See also Trivia References Yuri Sakazaki  Yuri Sakazaki (\u30e6\u30ea\u30fb\u30b5\u30ab\u30b6\u30ad or \u5742\u5d0e \u767e\u5408, Sakazaki Yuri) is a character introduced in the Art of Fighting series as a damsel in distress and eventually as a playable character. Since then, she has appeared in many SNK fighting games, alongside her older brother, Ryo Sakazaki. She is the first female practitioner of Kyokugenryu Karate. Her official nickname is Wild Flying Swallow. In the Neo Geo Freak's 1997 Volume 8 character poll, she was voted as the tenth favourite character with a total of 944 votes. In the character popularity poll on Neo Geo Freak's website, she was voted as the nineteenth favorite character with a total of 726 votes.History Art of Fighting  As a child, Takuma dedicated more time training Ryo to be next family heir rather than raising Yuri. When she was six years old, her mother died in a tragic car accident. Sensing his family was being targeted, their father leaves in order to protect them. With the loss of both parents, she becomes fearful and heavily dependent on Ryo for the rest of their childhood. When she first meets Robert, she does not trust him but eventually warms up to him. When she was 17, Yuri was kidnapped by Mr. Big on behalf of Geese Howard as part of a ploy to blackmail her father. Ryo and Robert search Southtown to find her whereabouts and rescue her. While held hostage, she finds out the identity of Mr. Karate. When Ryo defeats her captors, she reveals it to her brother and the family is reunited. In order to protect herself in the future, Takuma teaches her how to fight much to Ryo and Robert's chagrin. He trained Yuri in secret, but only taught her enough to defend herself. She becomes worried about Robert when he doesn't appear for their date before Art of Fighting 3. Setting out with her brother, they search for him in Glasshill. During their trip, she is wounded by Sinclair and briefly hospitalized. If the player plays through Robert's story, a strained Yuri appears to assist his plight against Wyler. She is healthy enough to leave with Robert by the end of the game's events. According to Ryo, she and Robert are still single by the time Buriki One takes place. She likely stayed at home to help the family business, as she is close enough to her brother to tell him to shave off the hair from his chin.The King of Fighters  Yuri, now confident in her fighting prowess, decides to enter the tournament, but is denied to enter by her brother. She defies his wishes and enters with King and Mai. It isn't until the 1996 tournament that they finally form a team together to represent the prestige of Kyokugenryu to the world. She is forced to join when Takuma gives her an ultimatum to either enter with Ryo or leave the house. After the 1999 King of Fighters tournament, Yuri wanted to once again show her independence. She begs King to take her place for the year and joins the Women's Team. In 2001, Robert reveals to the family that his family business is in trouble. They decide to all enter together to win the prize money and help out Robert's situation. Since 2001, Yuri then has been a regular for the Art of Fighting team alongside Ryo and Robert. In The King of Fighters XI, Yuri has a rival in the form of Malin. She stuns her father with her whimsical haircut before KOF XIII and is upset by her family's eccentric reactions. Since the rising skill of martial artists in the tournaments outclasses her basic training, Robert informs her of her brother and father's wishes to quit Karate for her own safety. Optimistic in her attempts to improve herself, however, she teams with Mai and King for the newest tournament. By the time of The King of Fighters XIV, the Sakazaki family has opened a Kyokugen BBQ restaurant with the help of Richard Meyer.Personality  Yuri Sakazaki is a friendly young girl who always cares about her family and friends. She is a strong believer of innovation and trends, constantly finding ways to improve herself through change. She is often arguing with her father and Ryo over matters regarding her newfound sense of independence. In the Art of Fighting series, it is heavily implied that she has a romantic interest in Robert after her kidnapping. As of Art of Fighting 3, she is confirmed to be in a relationship with Robert. Thought still present to a certain degree, this attraction and relationship is downplayed in the King of Fighters series.Powers Fighting Style  Yuri uses the lowest-grade version of the Kyokugenryu Karate discipline, and is taught only the basic and low-level moves. To prove her own worth, she personally arranges the style to better fit her physique and persona. Among her own moves are the Slipstream Handslap/Hyakuretsu Binta (Hundred Rending Face Slaps), the Big Butt Press/En'yoku (Swallow Wing), Hien Hou'ou Kyaku (Flying Swallow Fenghuang Leg), and the more popular Yuri Chou Upper (Yuri Super Upper) with its added variations. Later in KOF 2002 UM, she even manages to create her own version of the Kyokugen-style's signature Ryuuko Ranbu (Dragon Tiger Wild Dance). Several of her techniques also have a flying swallow-naming motif. Yuri's moveset is a running parody of various special moves from the Street Fighter series. This is very noticeable in The King of Fighters '96, when she received her Yuri Chou Mawashi Geri (Yuri Super Spin Kick), which was similar to Sakura's Shunpuu Kyaku. Yuri has since then received various moves and other mannerisms that are parodies of these (both Capcom and SNK alike): It is notable that KOF '96 came out exactly one year after Street Fighter Alpha, where Dan Hibiki (a character that parodies both Ryo and Robert) was introduced. It is because of this that Yuri can sometimes be taken as the counter-parody character from SNK to Capcom, given the impression \"even a basic level Kyokugenryu Karate can perform\u00a0Ansatsuken techniques\". Likewise, her classic attacks also have alternate character readings which may or may not parallel the original Kyokugenryu's existing techniques; Yuri Chou Knuckle's literal kanji reading is \"Hien Shippuu Ken\" (Flying Swallow Hurricane Fist), Yuri Chou Upper's literal reading is \"Kuuga\" (Air Fang; the followup is Ura Kuuga/Reverse Air Fang, read by Yuri as \"Double Chou Upper\"), the Yuri Chou Mawashi Geri her own version of the Hien Shippuu Kyaku (Flying Swallow Hurricane Leg) and so forth. In some games, when Yuri is knocked out with a special move, the top of her costume is torn off, exposing her bra. This happens in Art of Fighting 2, The King of Fighters '94, The King of Fighters '95, The King of Fighters XIII and The King of Fighters XIV, though in the latter case, her bra is not fully exposed. In Capcom vs. SNK 2, when Yuri finishes a fight with a \"Finest KO\" (finish with a super move as a counter to an opponent's special or super move), she will attempt to tie her gi tighter. However, the belt becomes completely undone and her top opens, revealing a semi sheer undershirt. Yuri will then blush in total embarrassment and immediately cover herself. This victory pose first appeared in Art of Fighting 2 when Yuri scores a Perfect victory.Music Image Songs Voice Actors Live Action Actors Game Appearances Mobile Appearances Cameo Appearances Anime Appearances See also Trivia King  King (\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0, Kingu) is a character in both Art of Fighting and The King of Fighters series. She debuted in the original Art of Fighting as the sole playable female character. Her official nickname is The Beautiful Kick's Illusion (\u7f8e\u3057\u304d \u8e74\u6483 \u306e \u30a4\u30eb\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3, Utsukushiki Ketsu no Illusion). King's appearance in the first game was made to hide her gender, with the game's flyer even using he to refer the character. According to an interview  with her designer, King was primarily inspired and modeled after Jamaican singer, Grace Jones. During the concept stage they took additional inspiration from the henchwoman character in the Hong Kong film China White , performed by Dutch Muay Thai action actress Saskia Van Rijswijk. In the Neo Geo Freak's 1997 Volume 8 character poll, she was voted as the sixteenth favourite character with a total of 616 votes.Story Art of Fighting  King is a skilled fighter who earned fame early in her career by defeating a famous Muay Thai champ. For various reasons - such as to hide her true identity, to present herself as a reliable fighter, and other issues with her gender - she made efforts to portray herself as a man to defend herself from the dangers of Southtown. Five years before Art of Fighting takes place, she suffers a humiliating defeat to Jack Turner and his gang. It is unclear of how, but she ends up working for Mr. Big as the (male) bouncer at the L'Amor Restaurant. Her secret is exposed when she is defeated by Ryo Sakazaki, who is searching for his sister Yuri. King agrees to help him save his sister and guides Ryo and Robert to Mr. Big's hideout. In the following game, she tries to make an honest living, but resurfaces on the streets. She enters the King of Fighters tournament with hopes to win the prize money to pay for a surgery her younger brother needs to gain the use of his legs. In her ending, she is surprised to see Jan walking on his own two feet. Both Ryo and Robert paid for the operation as thanks for her help with finding Yuri. According to Ryo, she is still well by the time Buriki One takes place. Running the Illusion bar, Ryo occasionally stops by to see her and catch up. Since he considers her a \"good friend\", their relationship probably isn't on the romantic track.The King of Fighters  Like all of the Art of Fighting characters to appear in King of Fighters, King's history is largely unchanged, but continues in an alternate continuity (Art of Fighting appears to take place in 1978-1979). During the series, King acts as the consistent member of the reoccurring Womens' Team. She also opens up her own bar in England (and later South Town), the \"Illusion\", and hires two waitresses named Sally and Elizabeth to assist her. She generally acquiesces to her teammates' whims as she wants to participate to make Jan proud. She agrees to join the Art of Fighting team in The King of Fighters 2000 when Yuri begs her to be her replacement. When Robert doubts her credibility, King is able to prove her worth in an extensive kicking contest. The series also emphasized her possible infatuation with Ryo, which is heavily hinted at in 2000 and The King of Fighters XI. Although she suggested other candidates for her position, King enters the KOF XIII tournament since she doesn't want to lose to the other teams.Personality  King is a kind, trustworthy, but violent woman. She is unquestionably loyal to her friends, but relentlessly unforgiving towards her enemies. Although King is very passionate, she rarely shows a sensitive side to her friends (and when she does, things just seem to go wrong). She often dresses in men's clothing (although her attire has become more feminine with time) and has a great affinity for fine wine. She also tends to obsess over money so she can pay Jean's medical bills. Though King was once at war with her own sex, she appears to have never been so with her sexuality and seems to be quite attracted to Ryo Sakazaki. (They even have special starting poses to imply this.) Although King acts rather masculine at the best of times, traces of femininity can't help but show themselves every now and then. For her KOF XIII team story, she expresses a desire to a wear a dress for her teams' victory party.Powers Skills Fighting Style  King uses a very distinct Muay Thai. She employs several acrobatic jumping and high kicks which are not used as much by Muay Thai kickboxers. Her fighting style is very much like the Korean style of kickboxing known as Kun Gek Do. Being French, it is more than likely that she employs Savate techniques in her fighting, as well. When King is knocked out with a special move in Art of Fighting, the top of her costume flies off. This continues to happen in Art of Fighting 2, The King of Fighters '94, and The King of Fighters '95 but doesn't happen again until KOF XIII. If this is done during AOF's story mode, King will say different quotes after her defeat. The same occurrence happens again in KOF XIV, only this time, the top layer of the top of her costume flies off, leaving the under layer of said costume unbuttoned.Music Image Song Voice Actors Game Appearances Mobile Appearances Cameo Appearances Anime Appearances See also References Geese Howard  Geese Howard (\u30ae\u30fc\u30b9\u30fb\u30cf\u30ef\u30fc\u30c9, G\u012bsu Haw\u0101do) is the chief antagonist of the Fatal Fury series and a secondary villain in the Art of Fighting series. His role varies in the The King of Fighters storyline, but he is always either in the position of a villain or an anti-hero. Geese also appears in many CD dramas and stars in his own character image album. He also sings in a number of image songs. In addition to appearing in manga adaptations of the Fatal Fury, Art of Fighting and The King of Fighters games published in Japan, Geese Howard was also the subject of a single-volume manga published in 1996 titled The Geese Howard Story by Etsuya Amajishi, adapting the character's fictional history from the Art of Fighting and Fatal Fury games. It was followed by a single-volume sequel in 1997 titled Geese in the Dark, by the same author. In the Neo Geo Freak's 1997 Volume 8 character poll, he was voted as the nineteenth favourite character with a total of 507 votes. 232 votes from the male fans and 275 votes from the female fans. In the character popularity poll on Neo Geo Freak's website, he was voted as the thirteenth favorite character with a total of 903 votes.History  The fate of Geese Howard is one of the major differences between the continuities. In the Fatal Fury series, he is dead. In The King of Fighters series, however, he is alive (excluding the KOF: Maximum Impact series). He is sometimes known for using his \"Nightmare\" mode for games where he is dead, such as in Real Bout Fatal Fury Special.Pre-Art of Fighting  Geese comes from a poor American woman and an Austrian terrorist. His father abandoned them after Geese was born in Southtown. Working for both of their sakes to surpass his father, he took up odd jobs around the city. Despite his efforts, his mother eventually died from poor health and hunger. Rather than dwelling in sadness, Geese tracks down his father in Europe and learns his father's real name is Rudolph Krauser Von Stroheim. He tries to assassinate him when he was 15 but fails due to his half-brother, Wolfgang Krauser, effortlessly stopping him (this same scene is later re-enacted in The Fatal Fury 2 anime). He tried to rid of his anger through religion but couldn't shake the humiliation of his loss. Learning at a young age that power grants results, Geese trained in the school of Hakkyokuseiken with Jeff Bogard and Cheng Sinzan, under Tung Fu Rue's tutelage. Other games imply that Geese had also studied with other martial arts teachers, including the grandfather of \"Blue\" Mary Ryan and Toji Sakata - mainly Japanese martial arts styles. During this time of their prime, the three were once renowned as the \"Three Brothers of Godly Battle\". However, at the same time, he also started to build his network with the Southtown local mafia through intimidation and personal bribes. This is where he also gained the services of Ripper and Hopper. Sensing that Geese would not use the sacred techniques of the school selflessly, Tung passes the secrets of the school to Jeff. He had hoped to tame Geese's spirit afterward but he departed from the place enraged, and saw the end of the school's relations with him. He focuses his efforts in overthrowing a kingpin named Mr. Big and he eventually becomes the reigning crime lord of Southtown. To separate his business with his mafia and to find a place to properly train, he also commissioned the building of his own headquarters, Geese Tower. As time passed, he also used the tower as one of the main operating stations for his own business, Howard Connection.Art of Fighting 2  Art of Fighting 2 reveals that it is Geese who orders Mr. Big to kidnap Yuri Sakazaki in the original Art of Fighting game. Yuri is kidnapped to keep in line Mr. Karate (Takuma Sakazaki), who is being forced to work for Geese - the SNES version of AoF states his orders included killing Jeff, but this may not be entirely canonical. It is Geese who orders Mr. Karate to fight his son, Ryo Sakazaki. Although he was powerful, Geese had still not completely conquered Southtown yet. Hoping to gain more men for his cause, he hosts the first known King of Fighters tournament. Unfortunately, he came out of the event empty-handed and was defeated by Ryo. He was able to escape and successfully defended his turf from the jealous Mr. Big.Fatal Fury series  In 1981, Geese Howard kills Jeff Bogard in front of his son Terry's eyes (revealed in Fatal Fury: Wild Ambition) and hires Billy Kane as his personal bodyguard. He sets up Billy as his champion in his King of Fighters tournaments. Ten years after Jeff's death, Terry, his brother Andy Bogard, and their friend Joe Higashi enter Geese's King of Fighters tournament. Terry faces him on top of Geese Tower and defeats him by knocking him out the window. While the town presumes him to be dead, Geese was actually alive, apparently thanks to the secrets of a Chinese scroll in his possession. The scroll, called the \"Phoenix Scroll\", was later discovered in Geese Tower; it allows the user to speed up their recovery rate. During Fatal Fury Special,\u00a0Geese hears that the scrolls grant immortality, so he discreetly searches for them. The story in Real Bout Fatal Fury explains that Geese obtained all three scrolls from Jin Chonshu and Jin Chonrei. However, he strategically wants them destroyed so that they would never be used against him. In the same game, he finally announces his presence to the public and organizes another King of Fighters tournament to settle his differences with the Bogard brothers. In the tournament's climax, he faces Terry and is once again thrown from the tower. Although Terry caught hold of his nemesis' hand, Geese refused his help and wrenched his arm away from Terry's grasp, laughing while falling to his own death, for good. Though there was speculation that he survived his second encounter, the story in Garou: Mark of the Wolves depicts that Geese had fatally fell from Geese Tower. The Real Bout series alluded to this fact with his nightmare form that appeared as a difficult secret boss. He is survived in the games by his son Rock Howard.Fatal Fury anime series  Geese's fate in the Fatal Fury anime trilogy differs from that of the game series. After suffering defeat from Terry in the first OVA, his appearances in the later two films are minimal. In Fatal Fury 2: The New Battle, he goes into hiding and is found by Krauser. The long scar across Geese's left eye was made by Krauser during his failed assassination attempt for his father. In the movie, Geese is seen only briefly as Billy Kane informs him of the Bogards' activities.The King of Fighters  The major difference from this series's continuity than others is the fact that Geese is still alive. An interview with Neo Geo Freak reveals that this is mostly due to the fact that The King of Fighters development team wasn't initially aware about Geese's fate in the Real Bout series. Once they heard about it, the developers from Real Bout team approved his appearance in the series due to their desires to create the Boss Team. Additionally, Geese's profile statistics during this series are the same ones for Fatal Fury Special (excluding his age). Having manipulated Mr. Big and Wolfgang Krauser's interests in his activities, Geese enters the 1996 King of Fighters tournament to entertain himself. His goal was to minimize his rivals' power and investigate the things surrounding Orochi's power, as well as to settle the score with Terry. In his team's ending, Billy shields him from an assassination attempt from one of Big's men and the crime lords part ways. Since then, Geese plays a minor role by hiring Billy to investigate oddities in the tournaments. He often plans for Billy's teammates in advance by offering them various personal awards. So far, he has been keeping tabs on Orochi and seems to have taken an interest in Gato's father. Geese was included as a bonus character for the Playstation 2 port of The King of Fighters XI. In it, Geese's win quote after defeating Terry shows him wondering why Terry is so surprised to see him, claiming that he already told him that he's immortal. After many years of his absence from The King of Fighters tournaments, Geese decides to return to participate, together with Billy and Hein, Geese's butler. It's later revealed that Geese has not unlocked the secrets of the Jin scrolls yet, but they prophesied the events within the story (Verse's appearance and warriors thought to be lost coming back to life), which is the reason why he entered the tournament. In the series's alternate universe, KOF: Maximum Impact, Geese is presumed dead once more since the game's setting hardly mentions his presence. However, his \"Nightmare\" form makes an appearance in the sequel. Ureshino alludes that this was done mainly due to Rock and Billy's appearances in the game.Personality  Geese is a proud man who considers himself a mighty warrior and as such thinks highly of himself. He craves power in all of its forms: from money to immortality, a desire influenced by various tragedies in his childhood, from losing his mother to being estranged as a stepson. He can be quite vengeful as well, as he holds grudges against Krauser and Jeff, whom he later killed. Despite appearing to be heartlessly evil however, he has his own code of honor and there are lines that even he will not cross; never underestimating his opponents, especially after suffering defeat from Terry. He will crush anyone who stands in his way and reward those he deems worthy of his respect, or in the case of Billy, whoever he sympathizes with. He appears to show respect to Tung Fu Rue despite their histories, even if he is sometimes sarcastic about it, as seen in Neo Geo Battle Coliseum, and more recently in KOF XIV. He has a fascination with Japan, often adorning the Japanese decorum on the Geese Tower rooftop with American flags, and has assimilated some Nipponese culture as a result. Whether because of ambition or to simply keep them from possible harm, he was apparently distant from his personal family, ignoring Rock's pleas to help Marie in her sickness until she reportedly passed away. As a result, this earned him Rock's indignation and the latter's devotion to stay away from his shadow.Powers Skills Fighting Style  Geese uses Aikijutsu as his primary fighting style. Aikijutsu is a style with several throws, counter throws and locks. However, it is a style that normally lacks striking attacks, and Geese's strikes seem to come from various disciplines of Japanese martial arts, mainly karate; though he also knows traditional and older schools of Japanese martial arts. While Geese is from the USA, his extensive practice of such martial arts has lead nearly all of his techniques to be written and spoken out in Japanese. Via his codifying 2/3-way counter throws, some games may or may not allow Geese to even reverse physical supers/DM's. Many official sources state that his fighting style is Hakkyokuseiken, but this is disputed. It can be assumed that Hakkyokuseiken only teaches the way of the chi and not fighting techniques, as Terry Bogard, Tung Fu Rue and Geese Howard, students of this school, employ different fighting styles. Through his chi control, many of Geese's attacks possess a wind-based motif, mainly through techniques such as the Reppuuken (Gale Fist), Shippuuken (Hurricane Fist) and Raging Storm; as he develops his style, he also adds some electricity-based touches, such as his popular Raimei Gouha Nage (Thunderclap Strong Crushing Throw), and the stronger version of his Raging Storm, the Thunder Break. KOF '96 was also the game that debuted the alternate \"wind slashing\" variation of his Reppuuken, which also converts his Shippuuken to turn into a short range energy shot instead that negates projectiles. His Double Reppuuken was also unique in that via Geese tossing out an energy mass prior to form a bigger projectile afterward, it would vary between games if the said energy mass would dissipate or not upon contact with either the opponent or another projectile (if so, it would cause Geese to toss a normal Reppuuken instead of the bigger one). Another one of his inconsistencies his is one of his many unique throw attacks, the Shinkuu Nage (Vacuum Throw); a unique technique he Geese tosses his opponent overhead then waves his arms while ending in a focused stance. In some games, it is a normal throw, while in others, it is a command throw instead; either way, its command has often varied, and ironically Geese's son has found more use for his version of it due to his ability to break it. His younger-self however, has used an old technique named the Explosion Ball, and also favored a more rigid boxing style mixed with karate. However, as he ages to his more popular present-self, he employs many new attacks and has a more upright stance that allows him to focus on his reversals and various throws. Though in tribute to his younger-self, one technique present-Geese has retained in some titles from Art of Fighting 2 is his Hishou Nichirin Zan (Flying Day Ring Slash). His Rashoumon (Thin Life Gate) technique which debuted in Real Bout Fatal Fury 2 also references the castle gate location of the same name. The command input of Geese's Raging Storm has remained mostly untouched in his game appearances due to its popularity with fans in Japan (coined the \"Pretzel Command\" by the fandom). It is one of the few moves from Fatal Fury to not undergo a command rearrangement in The King of Fighters series. In some games, such as Neo Geo Battle Coliseum, SVC Chaos, and KOF '98 UM, the command input is lax thus gamers can find a way to execute it with a simpler command that overlaps. Regarding its name, many different sources have romanized it as Raising Storm, Raging Storm or Rising Storm (the second naming variation which his son stays consistent with). However, its command so far has been notably the most strict in The King of Fighters Neowave via his younger self, in that messing up the input may have him activate Deadly Rave instead. Though prior to that via, Real Bout Fatal Fury 2, its command input instead was that of the Haou Shoukou Ken (while still fairly tight); in The King of Fighters XIV, its motion instead changes to that of the Ura 108 Shiki: Orochinagi (a quarter-circle backward-to-half-circle forward) motion and is instead his only strongest move via acting as his Climax DM (with the removal of the Deadly Rave), which simplifies his character somewhat and also resembles the \"windy\" version his son uses. Geese's CD attack while it had a name in more in-depth movelists in the Japanese scripts (known as the Fudou Kassatsu Uraken, lit. Motionless Life-or-Death Backfist), was one of the few along with some others had that its name brought to light as a command normal in the vs. Capcom crossovers. However, via his ripped SvC Chaos incarnation that appears in the console versions of 2002, his default CD/Blowback Attack (along with Goenitz, Shingo and King's) inflicts no damage via a programming error, while the aforementioned command normal version of it does. His Deadly Rave technique was created via Geese taking interest of the Kyokugen style's Ryuuko Ranbu technique, in games barring Art of Fighting 2, The King of Fighters '98 Ultimate Match and The King of Fighters Neowave where the DM was an automatic super, the DM was also famous for having a special sequenced command that could lead into finisher (a series of weaker-to-stronger normal attack inputs followed by a quarter-circle-back finishing input), but also required consistent timing and rhythm (which could be purposely dropped at the very end to extend combos). Via Daisuke Ishiwatari's departure from SNK to Arc System Works and when referenced in The Last Blade beforehand, a number of other video game titles have referenced this very attack's unique input sequence. While Geese has been balanced in terms of gameplay in many titles barring ones where he is intentionally overpowered, his younger version in Neowave was viable even in competitive play, despite some attributes being hard to counter such as his Deadly Rave having a notable amount of invincibility with a great hitbox; Geese even in his debut was rather considered to be a notably powerful boss in SNK titles, as his counter throws even worked when no incoming attacks triggered it. Younger Geese in Neowave also lacked a properly-programmed HSDM/MAX2DM. Ironically via Real Bout 2, Geese was notably toned down, with almost half of his classic moveset being removed along with a few new moves added. This version of him combined with his \"Nightmare\" version was brought back in a more balanced composite version in '98 Ultimate Match. His SvC Chaos incarnation which was reused for the later ports of KOF 2002 also had touches from his Nightmare-self as well, despite being his normal self that is still alive. In Neo Geo Battle Coliseum, a unique form of his Raging Storm is used as a stronger version whenever he manages to land one of his counter throws. This is a reference to this very version of the said move when used in Fatal Fury 3, where his Raging Storm will turn red during a unique combination of attacks and deal more damage. In KOF XIV, Geese instead is slightly reworked with some of his attacks removed once more, along with having new moves up his arsenal; his Ja'ei Ken (Wicked Shadow Fist) being removed and gaining a command throw mainly exclusive to Nightmare Geese. In prior games, Geese was lacking in offensive mixup; this is remedied with his new Fudou Ken (Motionless Fist), a move where Geese rushes forward with a palm strike (and was originally a command normal with auto-guard in the Maximum Impact series) with three followups, A (Flatter), Ba (Name) and Un (Growl), which respectively hit mid, low and overhead (but don't act as a true combo outside of counter hit/juggle hit for the latter two). Other new techniques in XIV are the DM's Raigou Reppuuken (Thunder Booming Gale Fist), a lightning-laced variant of his signature projectile, and the Oni Hanmon (Ogre Agony), a brand new DM counter throw that will still waste a stock if not triggered properly; if triggered, Geese will thrust his palm into the opponent then smash their face in to the ground.Music Voice Actors Live Action Actors Game Appearances Mobile Appearances Cameo Appearances Anime Appearances Similar Characters See also Trivia References The King of Fighters XII  The King of Fighters XII (\u30b6\u30fb\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u30fb\u30aa\u30d6\u30fb\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u30ba\u3000\u30c8\u30a5\u30a8\u30eb\u30d6; Za Kingu obu Fait\u0101zu T\u016berubu; KOF XII) is the twelfth installment in the King of Fighters series. SNK Playmore has announced that it is abandoning the Atomiswave system and is moving its most popular game franchises to the Taito Type X2 arcade system. In addition to KOF XII, KOF Maximum Impact: Regulation A and a new Samurai Shodown game in 3D were released on the new arcade system. KOF XII has no story and the Ash Saga concludes in The King of Fighters XIII. The main illustrations were done by Eisuke Ogura.Development  The game underwent a complete graphical overhaul, confirmed by Nona, artist in charge of the art in the The King of Fighters XI endings. All the sprites used in previous games for over 10 years were to be dropped and replaced with new high definition sprites. The programmers have stated their intention was to create the \"ultimate 2D fighting game\". Nona reaffirmed this once again in The King of Fighters Year End Party 2006 in Tokyo. SNK Overseas Manager Yoshihito Koyama revealed that the game was going to be \"3D mixed with 2D\"; this led to speculation that the game could use cel-shading to give the game a 2D look, but it was later revealed at AOU 2008 that KOF XII would use newly-drawn 2D sprites on detailed 2D backgrounds. Producer Masaaki Kukino informed Kotaku that the game is one hundred percent hand drawn, there being zero cell shading in the game. He has also stated that the main goal of the game is to give a new \"rebirth\" to the series. They have no intention of changing the main series into 3D in the future. The staff decided to create the new graphics during 2005 and 2006, and commented that they spent triple the amount of time developing it than the previous game. In an interview with Fighters Front Line, Kukino replies that each character took 16~17 months to complete with a team of 10 different designers. Additionally, the sprites were personally checked by Nona for quality. Due to the time demands of drawing such detailed frames of animation, as well as the decision not to incorporate older assets as previous games in the series have, there are only 20 playable characters, the lowest number ever in a game from this series. An interview with Kukino revealed that there would be console exclusive characters. On February 14, 2008, the first gameplay footage was revealed to the world showcasing the new, much larger, higher-resolution pixel art sprites at the Arcade Operators Union Amusement Expo (AOU) 2008. The footage also revealed the presences of Benimaru Nikaido, Terry Bogard (reverting to his original Fatal Fury outfit), Athena Asamiya and Kim Kaphwan in KOF XII. A location test was scheduled in Japan for April 18-20, 2008, but was canceled for unknown reasons. Kukino later stated in an interview this was done because the staff felt they should show a more polished product than the beta they had at the time. There was also a recruiting ad for part-time positions on SNK's Japanese website, asking particularly for a game graphic designer with experience in animation and color design. A playable demo was available to the public at the 46th AOU on September 18, 2008 and the 2008 Tokyo Game Show on October 9, 2008. The January location test featured a new visual layout unlike those seen in the past. Macha Yusa stated that the last location test would take place on February 27~March 4 this year. However, news of another location test popped up for March 6~8.Game Mechanics  KOF XII uses the usual 3-on-3 team system with each fight consisting of 5 rounds. The Tactical Shift System from The King of Fighters 2003 has been removed. Since there is no story for this installment, there are no default teams or team endings in the roster, so players are free to make whatever teams they desire. The game returned to its standard four button layout. Players can still dash, backstep, and perform rolls as their evade. Recovery rolls can be done with any button and throws are now performed by holding a direction and tapping A+C when close. The C+D attacks are still present but the Guard Breaks from previous games (pressing C+D while blocking with a block of super energy) can now be done at any time. Super special moves will now be executed in real-time and in a similar manner as The King of Fighters '94, meaning that there's a single level superbar that gradually drains once it is maxed. The newest addition to the game system are \"Critical Counters\". When the Super Gauge is at its Maximum stage, the player can time their attack to clash with their opponent's blow and leave them open for a devastating attack. After a successful counter, the player with the advantage can dash, combo, and even perform a special finisher attack with their character's desperation move. The time frame for this effect lasts as long as the green colored ripple from the clash is on screen; once it dissipates, the damage boost from the Critical Counter will end. Counters can be done on the ground or while airbone. The clashes of Critical Counters will only occur when strong attacks (or certain moves performed with strong attacks) connect simultaneously. Each stage has two types of themes played for it. Depending on the stage, the themes can work with the depicted stage ambiance or play a standard musical riff. The music staff from the previous title were in charge of overseeing the production but were not the ones conducting the music. As a side note, the music played during the trailer is included as a track in the game.Console Exclusive Characters Related Media  To promote the game, SNK announced a cellphone series called KOFXII Tokusetsu Corner for the Yahoo and imode Japanese networks on August 1, 2008. Each volume features an original story and bio information for three characters that will be in the game's lineup (revealed to be Ash, Kyo, and Terry). The style that these are presented in is similar to the in-game profiles of KOF: Maximum Impact 2. These novelizations were later added to the character profiles on the official website. On April 23, the series also had a collaboration event with the Japanese artsite, pixiv. For people who have a pivix account, the entries can be seen here.Stages External Links Trivia The King of Fighters XI  The King of Fighters XI (KOF XI) is the eleventh installment of The King of Fighters series. This game continues the \"Tales of Ash\" Saga, started in The King of Fighters 2003. Its tentative title was The King of Fighters 2004 though this name was debunked by the end of 2004. The numerical distinction for the series is based primarily on SNK Playmore wanting to avoid being locked into a rigorous yearly schedule of releases.Storyline  Mukai, a member of a mysterious group, stole the Orochi seal in the last tournament and broke it, causing confusion and destruction to happen from within sight. Taking advantage of the situation at hand, Ash stole the Yata Mirror from Chizuru and drained her powers in the process. In the advent of a new KOF tournament, new faces are handed invitations, while old faces, such as Eiji Kisaragi, return to the ring. Among the new KOF participants are Oswald, Duck King (a South Town veteran fighter himself), Momoko, and Elisabeth. All these fighters will find themselves in a tournament full of mysteries and secrets started by motives that they\u2019d ignored. Behind this healthy competitive tournament hides a hidden force called \"People from the Past\" with a mysterious goal.Game Mechanics  Aside from the already known gameplay maneuvers that add much depth to the gameplay, Runs, Rolls, Short Jumps, Guard Cancel CDs and Rolls, Empty Cancels, and the returning Quick Emergency Roll, the four largest innovations KOF XI brings to the franchise are the Quick Shift, the Saving Shift, the Skill Gauge and the Dream Cancel. The Skill Stocks significantly complicate the gameplay of KOF. The Power Stocks that existed previously are still present, and are filled in the usual fashion. Nevertheless, there are now Skill Stocks as well, which gradually build up over time. Each team begins a match holding the maximum of two Skill Stocks. Offensive maneuvers, such as Desperation Moves, Guard Cancels, and Tag Attacks, continue to use Power Stocks. However, more defensive or tactical maneuvers, such as Guard Evasion, Saving Shift, and Quick Shift, use Skill Stocks. KOF XI utilizes the Tactical Shift System from KOF 2003, but makes very important changes. The Quick Shift allows you to change into another character in the middle of any combo, prolonging it, or in the middle of any attack, no matter if it was blocked or not, canceling the frames of animation of the attack, if it's needed. The Saving Shift allows the player to take out a character when he is being hit as soon as he is hit, or in any moment, at the cost of both skill bars. This effectively cuts many combos that otherwise would do a lot of damage, eliminates the possibility of infinities by repeating chains of attacks on the ground (excluding aerial juggles) and brings an element of balance to the game. While it is possible to escape from any combination of attacks on the ground, it is not possible to use Saving Shift to get out from a Desperation or Leader Desperation move. The last new feature of KOF XI is the Dream Cancel. Like the Super Cancel that first appeared in KOF '99, Dream Cancel allows players to use stocks to interrupt a move in the midst of its execution with a more powerful move, allowing devastating combos; however, the Dream Cancel is more deadly than ever, allowing a DM to be canceled into an LDM, at the expensive price of two Power Stocks and one Skill Stock. Should the timer run down in a match, the winner is no longer decided based upon who has the most life remaining. Instead, the judgment bar, a new bar of circular shape composed of two colors, each one representing one player (red or blue, which are the colors displayed in the portraits of the characters of each side) acts as a quantifier of the skill of each player. Whichever player has the judgment bar towards his side will be the victor if none of the teams win defeating all three characters from the opposite team; rarely, if the bar is exactly in the center, the match will end in a draw and both sides will lose. The bar is affected by each attack that the players get in, combos affect progressively more, and when a character of the opposing team is defeated, the bar suffers a big change against that player. This makes taking care of keeping one's characters alive pretty important, giving strategy to the tags system.Characters Hero Team Rivals Team Fatal Fury Team Art of Fighting Team Ikari Warriors Team Psycho Soldier Team Mark of the Wolves Team Agents Team Anti-Kyokugenryu Team K' Team Kusanagi-Yagami Team Mid-Bosses Bosses Sub-Boss Boss PlayStation 2 Exclusive Hidden Characters PS2 Special Edit Teams Unrequited Love (?)

His name is frequently written in katakana; earlier games used to write his name in kanji (\u5742\u5d0e \u4eae, Sakazaki Ry\u014d). In Gamest's 1997 Heroes Collection, Ryo was voted as the staff's twenty-fourth favorite character. He shared the spot with Sie Kensou and Toru Kurosawa, a character from Sega's Last Bronx. In the Neo Geo Freak's 1997 Volume 8 character poll, he was voted as the seventeenth favourite character with a total of 602 votes. And In a 2005 poll made by SNK-Playmore USA, he was voted as the fifth fan favorite character with a total of 193 votes. Both Nobuyuki Kuroki and Youichiro Soeda have Ryo is their favorite character from the Art of Fighting series.Development  In an interview Takashi Nishiyama states that Ryo was created as a homage to Ryu from Street Fighter.  Artist Shinkiro has expressed he had no problems with designing Ryo in contrast to Robert Garcia due to Ryo's poor state.  SNK staff members Youichiro Soeda said that Ryo and Robert's debut was unique to other games based on the company because it did not focus on fighting tournaments but instead of the duo's quest to save Yuri Sakazaki.Story  Ryo is the son of Takuma Sakazaki and Ronnet Sakazaki and the older brother of Yuri Sakazaki. As Ryo was deemed to be Takuma's successor, he began his martial arts training at an early age. His father instilled him with the difficult principle of self-reliance, where a person's own strength can form their worth in the world. He eventually gained a sparring partner and friend when Robert Garcia was admitted into the dojo. On Ryo's 10th birthday, his mother died in a tragic car accident. His father left their home and left Ryo to take care of Yuri. Ryo did this by partaking in construction work and tirelessly strived to defend his family's dojo. Remembering his father's lessons during his training, he also took up street fighting. At first, he did poorly but, after many years of persistence, he eventually established himself as a fearsome and renowned fighter.Art of Fighting  In the first Art of Fighting, Yuri is kidnapped by Mr. Big, a local criminal mastermind of the dangerous city, Southtown on behalf of Geese Howard. During his journey, he met a bouncer named King, who guides them to Mr. Big's location. With Robert and King's help, Ryo confronts and defeats the kingpin. His pursuit for Mr. Big leads him to a karate dojo where a mysterious man challenges him. When Ryo prevailed, he threatens to finish Mr. Karate unless he told them information about Yuri's safety. Before he deals the final blow, Yuri reveals the man's identity as their father. After eleven years of separation, the whole family is reunited. Before the events of the second game, Ryo went to the mountains for training. He received an invite for a King of Fighters tournament and accepted it to test his strength. When he reaches the finals, the tournament's host, Geese Howard, expresses his desires to recruit Ryo into his services. Ryo refuses and subsequently fight him atop his office in Geese Tower, and defeats him with tremendous effort. Unfortunately, Geese manages to escape and later enacts the beginning of the Fatal Fury story. Ryo's role in the following game is reduced to being a supporting character for Robert. In his ending for the game, he hands his sister a ticket for Robert's flight back home and wishes the best for both of them. Additionally, he gains two new rivals: Kasumi Todoh and Jin Fu-Ha. Presumably, after the Art of Fighting series ended, Takuma retired from fighting and entrusts the Kyokugenryu dojos to Ryo. At least two dojos are in operation, one near Southtown and one is later entrusted to Ryo's student, Marco Rodriguez. This is supported by the fact that Ryo takes over the Mr. Karate mantle that his father once held in Fatal Fury: Wild Ambition and Buriki One.The King of Fighters  The appearance of Ryo in Fatal Fury Special as a secret final boss was perhaps inspiration to SNK's most notable fighting game series, The King of Fighters. Indeed, much of the appeal of the first KOF game, The King of Fighters '94, was that characters from Art of Fighting and Fatal Fury could fight alongside and against each other. Many details were originally retconned to allow the characters of Art of Fighting and Fatal Fury look around the same age though it's currently accepted that the KOF timeline is separate from their respective series. Although both protagonists would only play supporting roles in the series, Ryo and Terry share a friendly rivalry with one another. This is sometimes implied through special intros, official art, and game openings in select KOF titles. Throughout the series, the Kyokugen style is depicted as a struggling family business, funded almost entirely by prize money earned from KOF and Robert's vast wealth. Each year, at the conclusion of KOF, the Kyokugen dojo would often have many applicants due to the strong performance of the team. Despite their hard fought success, most of these applicants would later quit, due to either the strenuous training regime or mysterious people who appear and trash the dojo. The family manages to keep two gyms running, one in South Town and a second in Mexico. Ryo usually teams up with Robert, Yuri, or Takuma to continue spreading the fame of the Kyokugen style. He usually tries his best to keep his sister away from the tournaments and relents to his father's demands. In The King of Fighters 2000, he welcomed King into the team, even through his best friend's protests. Takuma apparently noticed (and somewhat mistook) the respect the young fighters had for one another and presses his wishes for her to join whenever the time calls for it. In The King of Fighters XI, Ryo indicates that Marco is currently a green belt. By the time of The King of Fighters XIV, the Sakazaki family has opened a Kyokugen BBQ restaurant with the help of Richard Meyer. Ryo, displeasing with his family attitude regarding their training, is determined to leave South Town and is accompanied by his student, Khushnood Butt.Personality  Ryo is very serious about fighting and loyal to his friends and family. He has been given discipline through his Karate training by his father, Takuma. He treats Robert as his rival, but they are best friends. He is a little old fashioned and blunt, which sometimes alienates him from his trendier sister and stylish rival. He's also admits to not being very smart\u00a0or talented but he believes that these are obstacles for him to overcome. Compared to Yuri and Robert's ideology on training, Ryo believes he can attain greatness in his art through hard work and experience. Having raised both himself and Yuri during their childhood, he struggles with his own wishes to protect his sister and his own wishes to see her grow up. He accepts her growing maturity with bittersweet acquiescence. It has been implied that there is some romantic tension between him and King. He apparently thinks her to be a good friend though she may think more of him since he contributed to her brother's recovery in Art of Fighting 2. Their relationship is referred to various times during The King of Fighters series. In King of Fighters XIII's story mode, Yuri specifically mentions Ryo and King dating.Powers Fighting Style  Ryo was taught to be the \"tiger\" of Kyokugenryu Karate, ironic since his nickname calls him the dragon. In Buriki One, he seems to use ordinary Karate. His main strength relies on his fierce punching attacks, which is closer to his father's style. His (in)famous Tenchi Haou Ken (Heaven & Earth Supreme Sparkle Fist) is a good result of this type of style as such a punch often was able to automatically put opponents in stun upon impact, despite the low damage it did compared to other DM's (KOF XIII amps this up with a stronger version of this technique as his Neo Max). His Art of Fighting and KOF incarnations tend to differ from one another such as his fighting stance. His Kohou (Tiger Roar) often either faces towards the screen (KOF) or the background (Art of Fighting). In KOF '96 onwards, his signature Ko'ou Ken (Tiger Sparkle Fist) turned into a close range attack afterwards though his Capcom crossovers beg to differ. Ryo during the NESTS Saga adds defensive touches to his style. His Joudan and Gedan Uke (High-Level and Low-Level Reception) parrying command normals enable him to shave off attacks and press the offensive as Ryo is able to cancel into attacks should he block via this method. Both of these types of parries are based on traditional types of basic blocking seen in most martial arts dojos. His Joudan Uke however, has varied in terms of animation, ranging from a rushing cover block or an outward single arm block depending on the game; and in KOF XIII, his Gedan Uke also gets a change in animation.Music Voice Actors Live Action Actors Game Appearances Mobile Appearances Cameo Appearances Anime Appearances Similar Characters See also Trivia References Blue Mary  Blue Mary (\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u30fb\u30de\u30ea\u30fc), whose real name is Mary Ryan (\u30de\u30ea\u30fc\u30fb\u30e9\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3), is a character from both the Fatal Fury and King of Fighters series of fighting games.

The leather jacket she wears is a keepsake given to her as a gift from Butch. Having been taught by her former lover how to fight, she becomes a freelancer. Throughout the series, she takes on various odd jobs to investigate mysterious cases. During this time, she meets Terry and the two become good friends.The King of Fighters  In this series, her work was far from over. One day, a mysterious benefactor requested her services to enter the King of Fighters tournament, along with Billy Kane and Ryuji Yamazaki. During the outcome of the tournament, it was discovered that Yamazaki had become more and more insane due to the Orochi blood coursing through his veins and that Billy was sent by Geese to keep an eye on him in order to learn the secret of the Orochi power. However, during a moment of confusion, Yamazaki escaped and Mary was left to ponder on Geese's motives and the root of the situation. Following its conclusion, Terry Bogard informs her of the NESTS cartel and their actions occurring in Southtown. With a new goal in mind to stop the organization, Mary joins the Women's Team along with King, Kasumi Todoh, and Li Xiangfei, and the \"Lonely Wolves\" in 2000 and 2001 to assist in stopping NESTS in the following tournaments, eventually leading to its demise. In 2003, she joins the tournament to investigate the movements of Those from the Past and teams up with former teammate King, as well as another Fatal Fury Team alumna Mai Shiranui. In KOF XI, Mary teamed up with Vanessa and Ramon to continue her case.Personality  Blue Mary is very friendly towards everyone, but she knows (or thinks) that her job must come first before everything else. Mary developed a strong bond with Terry, they seem to have a genuine care and fondness with each other.Powers Skills Fighting Style  Blue Mary employs the fighting art of Combat\u00a0Sambo.

This game features all characters from the 2D games and is a dream match installment. The game's storyline is a standalone parallel world based on the events of Samurai Shodown V and previous games in the series (ie: Gaira is bald, Genan has his children from his second ending). The producer gives it the nickname \"festival game\". Set in an unknown year, Yoshitora makes a proclamation to decide the strongest fighter in the world. Each battle takes place at various festivals from countries all over the world. Every stage represents a different festival or holiday, for example Halloween in Ireland, or the Lunar New Years in China.Overview  Samurai Shodown VI is the next installment to the Samurai Shodown series after Samurai Shodown V Special. The game features new backgrounds with 2D and 3D elements, as well as a returning cast of all 28 characters from Samurai Shodown V Special, as well as all 7 characters from Samurai Shodown and Samurai Shodown II that didn't appear in later games, and 4 new characters. It also features a \"spirit select\" system, which allows players to choose between six different fighting styles based on all previous installments. Despite normal Samurai Shodown releases and distribution outside of Japan, the game has been released outside of the country on the Atomiswave system sponsored in the United States by Sega but had limited distribution. The game was released for the Playstation 2 in Japan on January 25th, 2006. The PS2 release added even more playable characters, and three more spirit select systems to go along with them. With the PS2 release, virtually every character to have ever appeared in the 2D Neo Geo games, including the referee, Kuroko, and the animal characters, are all playable. The sole exception is the courier man Hikyaku. Due to the controversy surrounding the graphic nature of its predecessor and Sega sponsorship, the violence is toned down. The ability to perform fatalities is removed from the game, and blood effects are replaced with fireworks. In addition, more controversy came about with the fact that all of the voice actors were replaced with new ones, causing massive fan outcry. The character Iroha was well-received by fans in Japan and stars in several mobile games.Character Roster Returning from Samurai Shodown I & II Newcomers Mascots Alternative Versions External Links ", "Enigmata stellar war Wiki": "Enigmata stellar war Wiki ", "Enigmata Stellar War Wiki": "Enigmata Stellar War Wiki ", "Tapsonic TOP Wiki": "Tapsonic TOP Wiki ", "BYM Tank Crew Wiki": "BYM Tank Crew Wiki ", "THE CREW Wiki": "THE CREW Wiki ", "Wiki The Crew": "Wiki The Crew ", "Osmo28s Wiki": "Osmo28s Wiki ", "Small YouTubers Wiki": "Small YouTubers Wiki ", "Age of Empires Online Wiki": "Age of Empires Online Wiki Advisor  The Advisors are a feature of Age of Empires Online.Gameplay List of Advisors  There are 4 versions of each advisor.

Take control of the Greeks as they navigate the tribulations of maintaining an empire in a region rife with conflict..Quests Starting Resources  200 200 150 0Overview  The Greeks are an all rounded civilization that has an extremely strong Bronze Age and Golden Age. They bear many similarities with their Age of Mythology counterpart, including Hypaspists  and Toxotes. The Greeks are recommended by most players to be a new player's first premium civilization because of their simple play style. Quests are usually completed with a mix of Gastraphetes and Ballistas. Although most people do not play Greek as their main civilisation, top players such as sG Zuta and theMistaa are well known for their Greek play.Behind the scenes Development  The Greek civilization was the first playable civilization during the beta release of the game. The Greeks were the first developed because \"the ancient Greeks are a well-known civilization, and their history includes many interesting events and personalities that will be familiar to people. In going back to this era of history, the Greeks were a natural choice.\"Historical background  The Greeks were, unlike modern Greece, a fragmented group of independent city-states that were in a state of almost constant civil war, only uniting to fight a common enemy (ex. Persians\u00a0or Romans). They mainly fought using phalanxes filled with Hoplites that usually ended in heavy causualties on both sides. Only until Philip 2nd of Macedon did Greece fully unify under one ruler. This empire was established using a more diverse army filled with infantry, archers, and Calvary unlike the other city-states using only infantry. The Macedonian Empire was spread even further thanks to Alexander the Great. He was able to conquer Persia all the way to northern India. Greece was able to provide the world many historians, philosophers, and engineers (ex. Socrates, Plato, Aristotle). The Greeks were eventually defeated by the emerging Roman Empire in 146 B.C.E.Units (Egyptian)  The Egyptian Units\u00a0are a the controllable characters of the Egyptian Civilization.Economy Units  The Egyptian Economy\u00a0Unit are produced from the Town Center (Villager), the Market (Caravan) and the Dock (Fishing Boat, Merchant Transport).Infantry Unit  These Egyptian Infantry\u00a0Units are produced from the Barracks.Ranged Units  The Egyptian Ranged\u00a0Units are produced from the Barracks (Slinger), the Stables (Chariot Archer) and the Fortress (Elephant Archer).Cavalry Units  The Egyptian Cavalry Units are produced from the Stables (Camel Rider) and the Fortress (War Elephant), except the Scout, he cannot be trained.Siege Units  The Egyptian Siege\u00a0Units are produced from the Siege Workshop.Naval Units  The Egyptian Naval\u00a0Units are produced from the Dock.Support Units  The Egyptian Support\u00a0Units are produced from the Temple of\u00a0Ra, Temple of Set and  Temple of\u00a0Ptah.Unique Units  The Egyptian Unique\u00a0Unts are produced from the Fortress, but need a special advisor.Units (Persian) Economy Units  Persian Economy Units are trained in the Town Center (Villager), the Market (Caravan) and the Dock (Fishing Boat, Merchant Transport).Military Units Infantry Units  Persian Infantry Units are trained in the Barracks and the Immortal Camp.Ranged Units  Persian Ranged Units are trained in the Archery Range (Bowman, Takabara) and Stables (Mounted Archer).Cavalry Units  Persian Cavalry Units are trained in the Stables, excpet the Scout, he cannot be trained.Siege Units  Persian Siege Units are trained in the Siege Workshop, and Fortress.Naval Units  Persian Naval Units are trained in the Dock.Unique Units  Persian Unique Units are trained in the Fortress, but require the specific special advisor.Support Units  Persian Support Units are trained in the War Academy.Capital City  The Capital City is the player's main city which functions as a customizable \"character\" or \"avatar\".

The Persians were released on October 18, 2011 as a Pro civilization, which meant that the civilization had to be purchased to play (more details about Pro civilization\u00a0: see Civilization). The Celts were delayed and eventually released on March 26, 2012.Historical background  The noun\u00a0Celt\u00a0(or Kelt) comes from the greek k\u03ad\u03bb\u03c4o\u03b9, keltoi (the mighty, the great)\u00a0when the people were first described by the Greek historian, Herodotus. The Celts\u00a0were a group of tribal societies in Europe who shared a similar language root and culture. The Celtic tribes were famously depicted in stories for their extravagant feasts and battles against the Romans. During the early Iron Age, the Celts resided in central Europe. In the first millenium BCE, the tribes began to migrate throughout the rest of Europe. They settled in France, Northern Italy, Spain, the Balkans, Britain, and Ireland. One group migrated as far as Asia Minor, a part of modern-day Turkey, where they became known as the Galatians. The Celtic inhabitants in modern-day France were known as the Gauls by the Romans. Though the Romans were unable to defeat the Gaellic tribes in modern-day Ireland, they were able to eventually conquer the Celts of mainland Europe. The Gaels would continue to survive as multiple small kingdoms into the Middle Ages. Much of the Celtic language has become extinct after centuries of cultural assimilation by Roman and Germanic migrants. The six current \"living\" languages are Welsh, Irish, Breton, Scottish Gaelic, Cornish, and Manx (native speakers, greatest to least). Though a united Celtic empire has never existed, there is evidence of powerful chiefdoms who've subjugated large territories. Several times in history, Celtic tribes would form alliances against common enemies, such as to fight the Romans. \"Celtica\" was actually the name of a Roman province in the Gaul region of Western Europe.92.156.94.168 17:57, August 7, 2013 (UTC)Egyptian  The Egyptians are one of the six playable civilizations in Age of Empires Online.

Assume command of the Egyptian forces to lead them to victory and establish a dynasty throughout the region..Unique Features Gear  The following gear is featured in the Egyptian main page.Quests Behind the scenes Development  On January 25, 2011 the Egyptian civilization was announced as the second civilization. The Egyptians were released with the Greeks on August 16, 2011, Age of Empire Online's official release.Historical background  The Egyptian civilization was based on the fertile lands of the Nile River. The Nile would annually flood, bringing rich yellow silt onto the banks of the river. Around 3150 BC, Upper and Lower Egypt were united under the first pharaoh, Narmer, who became the absolute monarch of a hierarchial society. Ancient Egypt is commonly organized under a series of Kingdoms and Intermediate Periods. Egyptian Kingdoms were eras of stability:\u00a0Old Kingdom, the Middle Kingdom, and the New Kingdom (Golden Age).\u00a0The Intermediate Periods were eras of relative instability. The Egyptians flourished and became a dominant Meditteranean power, expanding into Nubia, Libya, and Levant. After the end of the New Kingdom era, Egypt fell into decline and became conquered by a succession of foreign powers (ex: the Nubians, Libyans, Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, and Greeks). After Alexander the Great's death, one of his generals, Ptolemy Soter, established himself as the ruler of Egypt and founded by Ptolemaic Dynasty. As the Greek Empire went into decline, Ptolemaic Egypt fell to the Roman Empire and became a Roman Province called Aegyptus.Crafting Recipes  Crafting Recipes can be used to learn how to craft an item from a certain crafting school.Somatophylax  The Somatophylax is a Unique Infantry unit exclusive in Age of Empires Online.Overview Advisor  Somatophylax Commander Matius is required to train this unit.

It has great jump and health and has the Climb ability that can make the Monkey go on any terrain even on pets.Advantages  The most common advantage of the Monkey is its own ability(like any other pet) which is Climb. That enables the monkey go on any terrain the player prefers. Its speed and jump are fairly high. The monkey is also considered to be the most appealing pet by far. On some maps such as Emerald Zone, some players push others off simply by going next to them and spamming climb. Slowly pushing them off and killing them. This does not waste the turn so you can then attack another player with a weapon. Climb can also force a player to stay in a position. If a player is in a small crater simply just go on them and use climb.Disadvantages  The disadvantage of our all-terrain Monkey is its health and sometimes its ability Climb, the disadvantage of using the climb is that the Monkey gets slower and when falling takes double the damage. In some maps, if the terrain is flat from an explosion, climb would be useless.Movements  The movement for the Monkey is the best as they have climb. Climb will make the monkey climb over any terrain. If you have climb on your monkey will walk slower, so it's a good idea to turn it off when your not using it.

Read at your own risk!Past  Glitch's past is vague- all he can recall is his name, 'Glitch'. He bears a Morbot symbol on the back of his head, implying that he may be of Morbot origin.Events of Metal Arms: Glitch in the System  The game begins with Glitch's discovery in pieces in the ruins of Iron Star by a Droid search party consisting of Hosed, Screwed, and Zobby the robot canine, who subsequently take him back to Droid Town, the secret base of the Droid rebellion. Their mechanic Krunk repairs him, and uploads the data and history of the Mil Uprising to his memories. Shortly after Glitch is brought up-to-date on events, the Mils attack the base. The leader of the Droid Rebellion, Colonel Alloy, finding himself without troops, reluctantly recruits the newly rebuilt Glitch to fight off the invading Mils and protect Droid Town. Glitch manages to seal off Droid Town's mines with an explosion, and thus defends the secrecy of its location, but a small platoon of Mils escapes, running amok in the town. After a deadly encounter with a Guard, Glitch defeats them all except a sole Grunt named Vlax, who leaves with the valuable Morbot Power Chip, heading for the Mil Comm Center to relay the location of Droid Town to General Corrosive, the Mil leader. To ensure the safety of himself and his new friends, Glitch decides to pursue. After racing to the Wastelands, cutting through the cannibalistic ZombieBots, befriending the large Droid Mozer and rescuing him from The ZombieBot King, Glitch arrived at the Mil Comm Center. He infiltrated the Mil Trenches, destroyed their Comm Array system and defeated a small Mil army before chasing Vlax into the Mil R & D Labs to recover the Morbot Power Chip. Following this, Glitch returns to Droid Town and is told a chip exists in Mil City that would allow the rebellion to shut down the Mils permanently. Glitch sneaks into Mil City and steals the chip, then delivers it to the rebels. He then returns to the city, because he learns Dr. Exavolt is alive and being held prisoner in Mil City. Glitch finds Exavolt and brings him back to Droid Town. Once there, Exavolt calls the Mils, revealing that he is in control of the Mils and that he is the one seeking to enslave Droidkind. Glitch helps in the evacuation of Droid Town, but is captured himself and sent to the Mil Colosseum. He escapes from the Colosseum by faking his own destruction. Glitch reestablishes contact with the rebellion. While almost everyone is safely in hiding, one of Glitch's friends, Zobby, was taken by Exavolt. Glitch finds Exavolt on a space shuttle ready to take off. Glitch attaches himself to the outside of the shuttle as it takes off. Finally, the shuttle docks with a space station in hiding behind a fake moon in orbit over Iron Star. As Glitch searches for Zobby, he also takes control of General Corrosive, and initiates the permanent shutdown of the Mils. Seeing that the station is lost, Exavolt begins a self-destruct countdown in the station. Glitch and Zobby escape in an escape pod and land back on Iron Star. Once back on the surface, Glitch is challenged one last time by General Corrosive, and Glitch defeats him. Glitch is received as a hero for destroying the Mils, while Exavolt, watching from his shuttle in orbit, vows revenge.Appearance/Personality  Glitch's appearance is somewhat similar to a Droid Miner, but more advanced, detailed and generally rusted. On the back of his head is a Morbot symbol. Glitch is a cocky 'young' robot with a can-do attitude, who under the player accomplishes big tasks fearlessly.General Corrosive  General Corrosive is the supreme commander of the Milbot Military, and a primary antagonist and boss character in the game Metal Arms: Glitch in the System.History Past  General Corrosive was created by the eminent Droid scientist Dr. Exavolt in order to \"evolve\" the Droid civilization, as a science robot smart enough to improve itself. However, Corrosive went rogue on activation and destroyed the lab he was built in, and his creators, with the exception of Exavolt, who simply disappeared. Corrosive went on to later reappear at the head of his new army of Mil Robots with which he planned to conquer Iron Star.Metal Arms: Glitch in the System  Despite being the highest commanding officer in the Mil army, he does not actively participate in the war until the climax. A hologram of him is present in the Mil City Center, and he is first seen in person in the Colosseum in Last Bot Standing, where he'll briefly interfere and try to shoot Glitch with his missiles. He is fought in person in Fall to Pieces, but because Glitch has no weapons, it is impossible to defeat him. Glitch manages to trick the General by faking his own death by disintegration. Corrosive is next seen in his Mil Space Station and the titular enemy of the level General Corrosive. Glitch now has all of his weapons, but because of Corrosive's essentially invulnerable chassis, he still cannot be defeated. Instead, Glitch collects enough Chips to activate the Control Console in the center of the room and control the General. Under Glitch's control, Corrosive activates the mechanism that will deactivate the Mils and subsequently destroy the Space Station. While Glitch manages to escape via escape pod, Corrosive was forced to fall into Iron Star in the exploding Space Station. Corrosive manages to survive the fall from orbit, but with his chassis severely weakened, vulnerable to defeat. Glitch finally destroys the General, winning the war and saving Droids everywhere from Mil control.Metal Arms 2  In the hypothetical storyline of Metal Arms 2, it would've been revealed that General Corrosive was also created by the Morbots and, thus, be Glitch's \"brother\".Personality  Despite his high rank and apparent 'self-improving' design, General Corrosive is nearly barbaric in nature. He is unable or chooses not to speak, and is seemingly easily led and tricked. He prefers to attack a target instead of thinking it through, the cause of his eventual defeat.Abilities  General Corrosive is unique in that, despite his low battery life and only possessing only one form of attack, his missiles, his almost completely unbreakable chassis makes him immune to any form of attack. Even with the destruction of the Mil Space Station and subsequent fall to Iron Star, he manages to survive reasonably well. General Corrosive is only controllable with the Control Console.About Metal Arms: Glitch in the System  Metal Arms: Glitch in the System is a game brought out by Swingin' Ape Studios in 2003.Setting  Metal Arms takes place on a distant Planet called Iron Star. Iron Star is a planet made from space debris, mainly different types of Metal. This planet is though to be made by a mysterious race called the Morbots. Droids, Mils, Zombiebots, and ArmyBots inhabit this planet, and they have stayed alive and grown industrious by using a substance called Ore.Plot  Three Droids, two of which are named Hosed and Screwed, are out looking for more Droid recruits to help with Colonel Alloy's Droid Rebellion. As they are searching their dog, Zobby, has found something. Its another Droid, with a strange marking on his head. He is deactivated, and he has lost most of his memory, save for his name. The three Droids and Zobby take this Droid back to Droid Town, where Krunk fixes his up. The only thing the Droid remembers is his name, Glitch, so they upload a new memory bank into him, explaining the Droid Rebellion and what state the Planet Iron Star is in. Iron Star was built by the Morbots, and the Morbots now reside in Iron Star's Core. The mere mention of Morbots sends everyone into a state of panic. No one goes into the Core for fear of deactivation. A MilBot by the name of Dr. Excavolt has been working on an experiment, to speed up the Robot Evolution. It went terribly wrong, resulting in an explosion and a new ArmyBot called General Corrosive. Excavolt's body was never found, and the Mils rage an attack on the Droids. Enslaving the Droids, and deactvating the ones who rebel against them, they have set the Droids to work in the mines. Anyone who has rebelled and lived works for an ArmyBot called Colonel Alloy.  Now that Glitch is reactivated, he works for Colonel Alloy, helping Hosed and Screwed since everyone else is either fighting on the front lines or destroyed. The two Droids teach Glitch a few things, and the three go to Seal off the Mil Mines so no Mils know the exact location of Droid Town. As they reach the entrance to the Mil Mines, Hosed and Screwed are blown by the Mils, and so Glitch has to fend for himself in order to seal off the Mines and rescue captured Droids. Glitch blows the Mines up and goes back to Droid Town, where he defeats several Mils so they can't get the location of Droid Town abck to General Corrosive. However, one Mil escapes, and so Glitch has to track him down before he gets back to Mil City. He traverses to the Wasteland using a R.A.T. that Krunk had stolen from the MilBots and modified. Glitch makes it to the Wasteland, and tells Krunk to go to the Pass to head off that MilBot. Glitch then enters the deadly Wasteland. Colonel Alloy gives you helpful information, saying that there are Zombiebots and that they have a thirst for fresh oil. GLitch kills the Milbot, and returns to Droid Town. He immediately goes out to Mil CIty, knowing that there is a special Chip out in the City that can shut down the Mils permanently. However, he gets captured before he can get the chip and must fight in the Coliseum in order to stay alive. He escaped by faking death. He gets the Chip, and once he establishes a connection with Colonel Alloy, learns that Zobby has been taken by Corrosive. Going to get Zobby, he learns that Corrosive is corrputed by Dr Excavolt. the Doctor is alive and well, and set out to kill all Droids. As Excavolt is getting ready to leave, Glitch finds him and battles him. Now that teh Mils are destroyed, and Exacvolt is destroyed as well, all the Droids are released, and the population of Iron Star beings ro rebuild their beloved planet.Predator  The \"Predator\" Mil bot is a free-floating bot armed with four rapid-fire laser cannons that can alternatively fire a barrage of rockets (In multiplayer with a cooldown time). The general shape of the predator resembles that of a giant wing featuring three giant engines (Or exhaust ports?) on the back, which emit a noticeable smokey particle effect. The Predators lasers are their basic attack each arm will fire one laser. The lasers by them selves are accurate but not to damaging, their alternate fire sends a barrage of rockets at where the arms are pointed which inflicts heavier damage than the lasers. A effective way to weaken them is get rid of their arms. In the single-player campaign the predator appears numerous times, Most of which are uncontrollable. The most featured was in the level \"I, Predator\" in which the player uses a control console to take control of an idle predator somewhere, which the player then uses to kamikaze a local power grid to thereby shut down a shield blocking the way. The predator will frequently appear on the level \"Bright Lights, Mil City\". It makes two more appearances in the game, one in \"You know the drill\" (Which is both controllable and vulnerable to a recruitment grenade) and once more in the level \"Seen better days\". The one in \"Seen better days\" is not controllable. In multiplayer the predator can be found in two maps, controllable and completely usable in the map \"Last Minute Effort\", and a usable (By recruiter grenade only) in the map \"Ruins\" The predator is controllable via a data port located between the first and second engine from behind/under the bot.Mil Grunts Introduction  The Mil Grunt is the most commonly faced enemy in the game, incredibly unintelligent robots built for minor effect, grunts are constantly seen throughout every level in the game (With the exclusion of both boss battles). What they lack in intelligence they make up for in firepower in numbers, grunts have no seemingly normal squad amount, but rather the amount varies by type, suggesting a by-division military system. These typical soldiers are the backbone of the Mil Army that work to control Iron Star under command of General Corrosive. Physically the Mil Grunt itself has a triangular-shaped body, thin limbs, and a digitigrade leg design, but plantigrade feet. Their physical stance is a bit of a \"Hunchback\" with their head attached leaning over the front of their bodies, with a Mil insignia on their shoulders/arm. Mils can be most commonly heard with a German accent. (This is likely a reference as a lot of the Mil Army seems based off of World-War Germany.) Behavior wise, Grunts seem to be maniacal killing machines, their accuracy is poor (On easy difficulty only.), they seem to laugh and enjoy inflicting pain upon others, and seem to have a lack of care over friendly fire. Quote: \"Not me not me! Shoot the droid!\" and the following conversation: \"So.. you eh wanna go.. uh...' 'Droid Huntin?' 'Yeah Droid huntin' *Both Laugh*\" Do not let their stupidity fool you, in numbers grunts are a deadly force. And they are consequentially the only enemy in the game capable of driving vehicles, operating switches, and using turrets. Throughout multiple times in the game the player will be faced against a grunt driving a Sentinel Tank, Loaders, RATs, or inside a Heavy Ground Turret.Types of Grunts  The Grunts are colored by their weapon specialty, with the exclusion of one specific grunt known as Vlax. Blue: The first grunt encountered in the game, this version of the grunt carries a simple mining laser and clearly not fit for military line of work. Red: Red grunts are the typical grunt to expect, the most common and in later portions of the game they may as well be cannon fodder. Wielding a Level 3 SPEW. Oddly enough a red grunt with a mining laser can be seen in the end-level screen, with glitch standing over the remains in glory. Green: The green grunt is the heavy-weapons division of the Mil Army, they wield Rocket Launchers and give the least care for friendly fire. Black: The black variant of the mil grunt is the sniping division of the Mil Army. Wielding Level 2 Rivet Guns, they are not very attentive but will fire at a player at extreme distances. Their aim is not to be the worry as much as the exploding rivets. Silver: The silver grunt is most commonly seen in the Morbot Region and the Mil Space Station, wielding a Toaster these grunts are, at least in the Morbot region, deployed as a containment unit, cleaning up the swarmers near the core.Dismemberment of the Grunt  The grunts can be dismembered in more places than most bots of the game. Head: While it offers no real noticeable difference in the way they fight, it causes the grunt's voice to distort into a varying range of pitches. Arms: When the arms are dismembered, the grunt will no longer be able to accurately fire it's weapon or throw grenades, leading to usual friendly fire due to their mentioned stupidity. Spine/Upper Torso: A grunt's \"spine\" can be broken making the entire upper half of the bot flail around helplessly, making them completely ineffective soldiers in the front lines unable to do anything to intentionally harm the player, or their allies.Droids  The Droids are one of the three main races of Iron Star. Created thousands of years ago by the mysterious Morbots, the Droids enjoyed a comfortable and peaceful existence on the surface of Iron Star, until one of their own, Dr. Exavolt, created the mighty tyrant General Corrosive. General Corrosive then created the Milbots and proceeded to take over Iron Star. Any Droid who was found afterwards was captured, imprisoned, and enslaved to work in mines for ore. The last remaining safe zone, Droid Town, and its army, the Droid Rebellion, are the Droid's last hope for survival.History Before General Corrosive  The Droids were created eons ago by the Morbots, for unspecified reasons. After the Morbots moved underground, the Droids lived in peace, adopting an industrial lifestyle, mining Iron Star's plentiful ore.Tragedy Strikes  Dr. Exavolt, looking to find the limits of Droid evolution, one day created General Corrosive. This towering monstrosity betrayed his creators, destroying his lab of creation and the science droids, presumably along with Dr. Exavolt. General Corrosive then created his own race of robots, the Mils, and enacting a war to conquer Iron Star. The Droids fought, but many were destroyed or deactivated. The survivors were turned into worker and slaves. Colonel Alloy, a hardened veteran, banded together soldiers and refugees and created the small town of Droid Town, with it and its Droid Rebellion standing as the only hope for the Droid race.Biology  Most Droids share a yellow/yellow-and-blue color scheme. If Glitch is possibly any indication, the Droids were modeled after the Morbots themselves.Cut Droid Concepts  Droid Explorer: An old, battered robot that\u2019s been off exploring Iron Star for years. For so long, in fact, that he completely missed that whole Mil/Droid war thing. - Scott Goffman Droid Trooper: The first Droids actually designed for combat, rather than re-purposed from some other job. Fairly effective grunts. Droid Commando: Elite combat troops (or at least as \u201celite\u201d as Droids get). Faster, stronger, smarter, and more heavily armed than the Troopers. - Scott Goffman Droid Engineer: No information on this one but it didn't make it into the game similarly to \"Mister Fixit\". Droid ABAT: I don\u2019t remember what it stands for, but it\u2019s an armored Droid troop carrier. Troops can ride on top, and the shields on the legs allow them to use it for advancing cover in combat. - Scott GoffmanCharacter Summaries  Glitch - The titular main character of Metal Arms, Glitch was found in pieces by Zobby and the Droids in the ruins of Iron Star. They took him to the secret base Droid Town, where he was repaired by Krunk and became part of the Droid Rebellion. Colonel Alloy - Colonel Alloy leads the Droid Rebellion. Before he became the leader, he was a Droid architect. He helped design the massive cities that now surface Iron Star. His final project would be the designing of a place called Droid Town. But the project would be cut short as the war between the Mils and the Droids began. The location of Droid Town is unknown to the Mils. Krunk - Krunk is the Head Engineer for the Droid Rebellion, and is Alloy's most reliable companion. He is known for his constant use of obscene language. Krunk has built multiple weapons for the Droid Rebellion, such as the ripper, and the control tether, a device he praises so highly he will even say \"'Bet D. Exavolt never came up with nothin' like that!\" Zobby - A robotic dog who lives with the Droids, Zobby is a helpful companion who can both drive and operate the turret on the RAT for Glitch. He cannot talk, and therefore cannot communicate with other Droids besides barks and growls. Screwed and Hosed - Two Droids of the Rebellion, Screwed and Hosed teach Glitch how to fight after he is repaired. They are both destroyed in Do Ore Die by a coring charge. Mozer - A Droid fighting against the Mils, Glitch meets Mozer in the Wastelands. He knows where the Mil Crater Compound is and leads Glitch there to capture Vlax. He uses a level two rivet gun and a giant bent metal beam that can smash Mils and destroy zombiebots in 1 hit. Much like a titan, he can jump and smash the ground, to create a shockwave effect .He leads Glitch to the Mil Compound that Vlax had escaped to but was trapped by the zombiebot King. Glitch frees him and Mozer agrees to return to Droid Town to join the rebels. Slosh - A strange bot, Slosh had been captured by the Mils and taken down to the Morbot Region. Glitch frees him from being stranded and in return Slosh helps him get into Mil City. He wields a toaster. Dr. Exavolt - Dr. Exavolt was once the head scientist of the Droid race, as he continued his scientific work to help the droids grow and prosper on Iron Star, until one day he strained too far from the Droid design, and created General Corrosive, whom sought to destroy the Droids, and all they lived for. Agent Shhh - The Droids' top spy, Agent Shhh is in Mil City as the best intelligence collector the Droids have. He is not seen aside from his eyes lighting up from his hiding spots. In Metal Arms: Glitch in the System, he confers to Glitch the information of the Mil's Droid Spy factory, and later how to get to where Dr. Exavolt is being held. Agent Goff - Another of the Droids' spies, Agent Goff is a Droid operative installed into a Mil Grunt's body. In Metal Arms: Glitch in the System; on his way through the Ruins, Glitch is ordered to reassemble Agent Goff, as he was found out by the Mils and disassembled. After which Goff reveals the location of Dr. Exavolt. Shady and Mr. Pockets - The Barter Droids. These two will sell you weapons, upgrades, ammo, energy and on some levels, arm servos and chips. for washers. If you hear their music, they will be around to sell you equipment. Vlax - A purple Grunt assumed to have a high status in the Mil Army. In Metal Arms: Glitch in the System, Vlax leads the first attack on Droid Town and escapes after Glitch cleans the town of Mils. He tries to transmit the location of Droid Town to General Corrosive but had to escape after Glitch destroyed the arrays. He stole Krunk's RAT, and was eventually destroyed by Glitch. General Corrosive -General Corrosive is the leader of the Mil Army, ruling it with a literal iron fist. He was created by Dr. Exavolt. General Corrosive led the Mils to destroy and enslave the Droids, forcing them to work in the mines to mine ores from the planet.Cut Characters  Scott Goffman said that this character: \"Mister Fixit\" was cut from the game. He is, \"able to build/repair just about anything.\"Milbot  The Milbots , commonly referred to as Mils, are a race of robots and the primary antagonists in the game Metal Arms: Glitch in the System. They were created by General Corrosive, and by extension, Dr. Exavolt to conquer the planet of Iron Star. The entire culture of the Mils is based on combat and aggressive expansion, and by the time of Metal Arms they have nearly completely wiped out the peaceful native Droids of Iron Star.History Past  In the aftermath of the Droidlabs Incident, which had concluded with the disappearance of the experimental robot Corrosive, the Mils started appearing and attacking Droid settlements. Corrosive proclaimed to Iron Star his leadership of these forces, for the purpose of defeating all Droids and taking over Iron Star. They quickly destroyed many Droid civilizations, and the Droids who were not killed were enslaved. Over the top of these civilizations came new Mil cities, Grunt factories, research labs, ore mines and public coliseums, where Droids would fight to the death for the entertainment of their new Mil overlords. Mil citizens lived in luxury with plentiful scrap, upgrades and energy, while the Droid underlings barely survived with the tiny amounts of energy that trickled down from the top, as the Mil Empire continued to spread across Iron Star's surface.Events of Metal Arms: Glitch in the System  There are spoilers below. Read at your own risk! All resistance had nearly been crushed by the Mils, with the exception of the hidden Droid rebel base of Droid Town, which Corrosive wished to destroy. The Mil Mines operation accidentally uncovered the Droid Mines, and thus by extension, the location of Droid Town became known to the Mils in the area, who attempted to report back. However, they were thwarted by the rampage of the new resistance member Glitch. Some manage to escape to Droid Town, and one Mil Grunt in particular managed to escape with the town's co-ordinates and Morbot Power Chip. After being chased through the Wastelands, Mil Comm Center, and Mil R & D Labs, Glitch manage to lock down and destroy Vlax and regain the chip. During these events, the Mils were also planning to to invade the Morbot Region to find and possibly destroy the Morbots, only to find the elusive robots had left for space. The invading Mils were destroyed by Glitch on his way to the Mil City Hub. Glitch later on infiltrated the Mil Spy Center, and subsequently \"rescued\" Dr. Exavolt from the Mil clutches. However, it turns out that Dr. Exavolt had been working with the Mils this whole time, and broadcasted Droid Town's location to the Mils. While the second invasion was again thwarted by Glitch, one Trooper manage to capture him and take him to the Colosseum, where he fights the metal giant himself, Corrosive. While the Mils belived Glitch was destroyed in the final round against General Corrosive, he manages to survive and learns that Corrosive is taking a rocket into space, presumably to find the Morbots. Glitch invades the Mil Space Station, fights General Corrosive, and uses the chip he gained from the Spy Factory to permenately shut down the Mils and destroy the Space Station. After one final fight with Corrosive, Glitch, and all the Droids of Iron Star, are victorious and freed from the Mil oppression forever. However, Dr. Exavolt escapes into space, vowing to return and destroy the Droids for good.Types of Mils  As Mils are aggressive and military by nature, they are arranged in a sort of ranking system, with Grunts being the lowest and General Corrosive as sole dictator apparent of all Mils.Weapons  Summarized list of weapons and what they do at each level.

(Small Projectile Emitting Weapon) Rocket Launcher Scatter Blaster Slingshot Rivet Gun Control Tether Toaster Secondary Weapons Coring Charge Cleaner Magma Bomb EMP Grenade Recruiter Scope Wrench Vehicle-Based Weaponry RJV-780 20mm Vorium Machine Gun Heavy Artillery Turret (AKA: \"Matt's Big Gun\") Mil Security Turret F&!?ing Krunked  F&!?ing Krunked is the sixteenth level of Metal Arms: Glitch in the System. It takes place in the Mil R & D Labs and the objective is for Krunk to meet up with Glitch. It is the only level where Krunk is playable.Story  Krunk needs to find a way to get to Glitch, and stumbles upon a room full of Mils undergoing experiments by a group of Mil Scientists. Krunk must blast his way through using the enemies abilities and meet up with Glitch.Overview  After Krunk escapes from being captures by the Mils, he needs to find a way to meet up with Glitch. He heads into the ventilation system of the Mil R&D Labs and finds himself in a singular large but close-quarters room full of experimental Milbots. Krunk presses a button on a control panel in the room which then releases all of the experimental bots freely into the room, none of which have a functioning friend-foe identification and thus shoot at random bots in the room. A local lockdown is engaged, and after Krunk uses his Control Tether & EMP grenades to take control of & destroy all of the experimental bots, the lockdown is released, and he meets up with Glitch. He then brags about his control tether, and gives it to Glitch to use for the rest of his journey. There are 0 Secret Chips, but the level has a Speed Chip available for beating the level in under three minutes and fifteen seconds.Krunk  Krunk is the Mechanic Droid for Colonel Alloy's Droid Rebellion. He fixed Glitch up and modified a stolen R.A.T from the Mils for the Droid Rebellion's use. He is voiced by Dan Castellaneta who is known for voicing Homer Simpson and the Robot Devil in Futurama.Apperance  Krunk looks like a walking trash can with four arms. Each of his arms holds a different tool for combat and fixing up different Bots and vehicles. He has a pirate-like peg leg, which causes him to walk at an ambling hobble.Biography Past  Not much is known about Krunk's past. He had worked for the people of Iron Star before the Mils took over. He joined Alloy's ragtag band of Droids when he first heard about them.A New Recruit  Krunk fixed up Glitch when Hosed, Screwed, Zobby, and the unknown Droid took Glitch to him. Krunk was able to repair Glitch, and got frustrated along the way, saying that \"he was a custom jobbie.\" It wasn't anything he couldn't handle, and all Glitch needed then was a simple data upload and, as Krunk put it, \"he should be as good as \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588ing new.\"Wastelands: Wasteland Thunder  Now Krunk teaches you how to drive the R.A.T that he modified. Glitch takes the wheel, while Zobby shoots at the Mil R.A.T.s. Once you get to the Wastelands, Zobby and Krunk go to the Pass, going around the Wastelands to head Vlax off so Glitch can finish him.Mil R&D Labs: F&!?ing Krunked  Now you get to play as Krunk. Krunk is in the Mil R&D Labs and he sets free some experimental bots. As the PA system announces the release, and orders the Mils to put the bots back in their pens, Krunk uses his control tether to control the bots. Once of the bots are destroyed, the PA system announces the \"Rogue Droid\", and a door to Glitch opens on the far side of the level.Personality  Krunk's personality is much like a frustrated Mechanic. He is swear happy, as you never once hear him speak without at least one swear word in the sentence. Quotes: \"Of course I \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588ing fixed him! He was a huge pain in the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588ing waste pan because he's some kind of custom jobbie. Nothin' I couldn't handle. Some of his memory chips were fried, so he's gonna need a new data upload. After that, he should be as good as \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588ing new.\" \"Head him off at the pass? Who the hell says that!? What are you, some \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588ing cowboy!? Alright, you'd better be right about this screw boy, because if you don't stop Vlax, I will personally weld your exhaust pipe to your ball bearings!\" \"'It's too high!' 'My head fell off!' It's always something with you \u2588\u2588\u2588ing bots!\" \"way to peice it togther d***!\"Titan  Titans are hulking metal monstrosities created by the Mil Bot Leader\u00a0General Corrosive as an assault unit and bodyguard for the Mil Armies. Heavily armed and armored, Titans supplant the lesser Mil Grunts as a frontline unit in large-scale attacks and as defenders of high-value bases and resources. Though they do not command troops on their own, Titans are nonetheless often found leading small battalions of elite troops when deployed to defend an area or hunt down dissenting Droids.Description  Titans are bipedal robots with a pair of linked chainguns, a shoulder-mounted rocket launcher, two armored legs, and a sizeable rear-mounted power cell that powers all of it. The head of a Titan has a single optical strip as opposed to two \"eyes\" yet this optical setup is sharper than that of other Mils, capable of picking up on movement and expediently locking onto it within nanoseconds. Since Titans are so dangerously equipped and are far crueler than the Mils' Grunt or Guard units, they never retreat from an engagement and relentlessly pursue their target until they or their opposition perishes or retreats.Appearance  First appearing in Into the Trenches as a military enforcer and reappearing regularly thereafter, Titans are uncommon when compared to Grunts but still spawn as a staple enemy either with a small group of accompanying Grunts, alone, or in clusters no larger than three. Later on in Mil City, shielded Titans that sport a Barrage Cannon amongst normal Titans as part of the Mil City patrol forces and are seen again later on aboard the Mil Space Station.Trivia  The Titan bears strong similarity to the ED-209 from the Robocop film series.Storyline  In the ruins of a once great city, 3 Droids and a robotic dog named Zobby come across another Droid. This Droid was damaged and had a different design than most. They brought him back to Droid Town and Krunk, the head engineer, fixed him up. After uploading his memory with information on Iron Star, Colonel Alloy called all the Droids together. Glitch was sent with Screwed and Hosed, 2 other Droids, to destroy the Mils that had broken into the Droid Mines. After getting into the Mil Sector, Screwed and Hosed were destroyed. Glitch then destroyed the Mil operation, freed Droid slaves and prepared to get out of the mines. After being trapped underground, Alloy told him to destroy the processing machine to seal the entrance to Droid Town. After doing this, he was ordered to clear out the base of Mil Grunts led by Vlax. Vlax escaped, and Glitch chased him in a R.A.T. to the Wastelands, which were filled with Zombiebots. In the Wastelands, Glitch met a large Droid named Mozer. Mozer showed him to the Mil Crater Compound where Vlax had gone. On their way, they were ambushed by the Zombiebot King who trapped Mozer. Glitch destroyed the boss, freed Mozer and went on their way. Near the Trenches, Mozer decided to head back to Droid Town but first gave Glitch his Rivet Gun. He fought his way through the Trenches and the Compound. After finding out Vlax had transmitted the location of Droid Town to Corrosive, he destroyed the communication arrays and went to the labs. After freeing Krunk, who had been captured, Glitch chased after Vlax in a R.A.T., destroyed him, and retrieved his Morbot chip. He then used it to enter the Morbot Region, and headed to Mil City. On the way, he met Slosh, a bot that helped him get into the City. From Slosh he got the Toaster. When Agent Shhh told him about the Spy Factory, Glitch went in, stole the Mil Operating Chip and got it smuggled out of the city. He then reassembled Agent Goff, a Droid spy, and learned where to find Dr. Exavolt, the long lost scientist thought to be dead. After saving Exavolt, it turned out he had created Corrosive on purpose, wanting to enslave all the Mils. General Corrosive sent an invasion of Droid Town. Glitch destroyed them all but was knocked out by a Trooper, who brought him to the Coliseum.... In the Coliseum, Glitch won 3 rounds but was faced against General Corrosive. He tricked the Mils and managed to escape. After learning that Zobby had been captured by Exavolt, he took a RAT to Exavolt's shuttle and stowed abroad. On the Mil Space Station, which had been disguised as a moon, he broke into a room with General Corrosive. After taking control of the general and destroying huge numbers of Mils, he used the Mil Master Computer to shut down all the Mils and then abandoned the station. After landing in an escape pod with Zobby, Glitch destroyed Corrosive, who's armour had been damaged in an explosion, for good. The Droids celebrated but Exavolt had escaped, plotting revenge on Glitch.Vlax  Vlax is General Corossive's eyes and ears of the Mil army. It takes a while during the game to hunt down and destroy him. Vlax is a unique, purple Grunt who broke through the Droid Mines and into Droid Town that managed to escape in a R.A.T. He was the only Mil who knew the location of Droid Town but was destroyed later by Glitch. He carries a Level 1 Rocket Launcher. In a cinematic scene, Vlax is seen running on a bridge and escaping. He also likes taunting the Droids by saying \"You'll never catch me, you rust-busting reject!\" and laughing hysterically. The best way to kill him is to take his arms off, knock his head loose and use the RAT's machine gun to polish him off, or squash him flat.Guard  Guards are an elite type of Milbot and the second type encountered in the game Metal Arms: Glitch in the System. They are tall, red robots who always wield a hailberd that can shoot energy pellets. They are first encountered in Clean Up as the final enemy in the level.History  There are spoilers below. Read at your own risk! Guards are the Mils' elite soldier type, as they are fast and hit hard. They are stationed in areas such as the Mil R & D Labs, Mil City, the Mil Colosseum , and the Mil Space Station. As other Mils, they are prone to stopping to taunt and are created from larger versions of Mil Creators. By the end of the game, Guards, as every other Mil, are shut down permenantly.Abilites  Guards have very simple attacks and attack pattern. In close combat, they swing their hailberds to chop up their enemies, and from far away, they shoot their energy pellets from the hailberd's tip. Their weaponless arm can be destroyed, but it will not hinder their abilities. Like most Mils, they can be controlled via the Control Tether.Mining Laser History  The Mining Laser is just that, it was originally made for the intention of just mining ore inside the outer crust of Iron Star. It was never even conceptualized as a proper weapon until the Mils overtook the surface of the planet, and forced the Droids into rebellion, and this was initially their only tool of self- defence & offence. In fact, the Droids had never prepared for such a war to happen, which is why almost all of the weapons are of Mil design.Level 1  The Mining Laser is the first weapon the player gets, as they start with it. It is once again no more than that, just a mining laser. It yields very small amounts of damage with a rapid rate of fire and infinite ammo (however it can overheat, and requires time to cool down).Level 2  At level 2 the Mining Laser dawns a new look, and the energy changes from a neon green to a solid neon yellow emitted from the tool. At level 2 it also gains the ability to charge a shot (half-holding down the trigger) to release a massive burst of energy, effectively making it a very lightweight laser cannon.Level 3  At level 3 the Mining Laser gets one last remodel, alongside another barrel. With rapid-fire dual cannon action the level 3 laser is properly recognizable as a weapon, keeping the charge ability from level 2 but with two barrels to double the output damage.Mils' Mining Laser  Blue Grunts are equipped with Mining Lasers and are the first enemies the player will encounter in Metal Arms. The difference between the Mil's Mining Laser and the Droid's Mining laser is the look, damage, and heat generated. The Mil's Mining Laser is meant for military use, not mining directly as much as making sure Droid slaves were going to keep mining. Unlike all other mining lasers in the game, the Mil's is blue, and yields noticeably higher damage, rate of fire, and heat dispersion.Trooper  A Trooper is an aerial attack Mil bot, equipped with a jump-pack, glide wings, dual lasers and assault Bayonets. The Troopers dual lasers have a long range with an alternating firing pattern. Dealing damage in small area around where the plasma hits. It is possible to fire quicker than the alternating fire while controlling Troopers. A highly mobile 'shock-trooper' unit, the trooper can reach great heights and considerable speeds with its jump-pack to shoot from afar, or enter a gliding dive. Colour schemes of bright lightning bolts come in a few different varieties. The Trooper is also notable for its melee attacks. The third strongest enemy melee weapon in the game, the Bayonet can deal high damage, and when combined with the Trooper's special aerial dive ability can wipe out half of a player's health bar with ease. Troopers are highly vulnerable to the Rivet Gun and Scatter blasters and the fire of other Troopers. Scatter Blasters are also advisable against the fast-moving enemy, as the weapon spread can assist in hitting them and destroy them quickly.EMP Grenade  The EMP Grenade is a secondary weapon used only by the player. When thrown, it will explode into a much larger version of the Recruiter Grenade's particle effect. Any bot within the radius of this \"explosion\" will be shut off for an average of 10 to 15 seconds, with the exception of a player. If a player walks into the radius of the grenade their screen will spiral out of control, causing their aim to be much less accurate. In-game description of the weapon: \"Emits an electromagnetic shockwave in all directions that disrupts cognitive and mobility circuits in nearby Mils.\" (However in the actual game, the EMP grenade affects Droid bots as well.)Levels  There are a total of 42 Campaign Levels in Metal Arms: Glitch in the System, and 15 Multiplayer Levels.Screwed  Screwed is one of Colonel Alloy's Droid rebels that was partnered with another Droid rebel - Hosed. After Glitch was repaired by Krunk, he wanted to help the Droid Rebellion. Colonel Alloy needed more rebels as the mines were under attack and most, if not all the other rebels were already fighting or destroyed. The only two Droids available were Hosed and Screwed, and were partnered up with Glitch. As the three were working their way along the mines, Hosed and Screwed taught Glitch how to fight and use other things that he might find in the battlefield. Once Glitch, Hosed, and Screwed came to the Mil side of the mines, a Grunt threw a Coring Charge at a bridge above molten metal (which both Hosed and Screwed were standing on) and blew up the bridge, with Hosed and Screwed falling to their destruction into the molten metal below.Infobox Rivet Gun Summary  A high-velocity projectile lunging piece of equipment, the rivet gun is a very powerful weapon in Metal Arms: Glitch in the System which can be acquired very early in the game as it's first appearance is in the level Seal the Mines. The rivet gun, at level 1, has only one function. It lunges a single long steel rivet at a target, which in the case of most Mil grunts will have a high chance of breaking or dismembering one of their limbs completely. The rivets are hurled at such a velocity that they pose a major threat to even the zombiebots, as the rivet's impact force quickly makes them fall apart, unable to withstand the sheer impact power of the rivet itself. At level 2, the rivet gun does not change much in terms of power. It gains the ability to hold ten extra rivets in the maximum amount. However, it does gain a new ability. Upon impact, the rivets will automatically start to charge up after 0.8 seconds, and explode one second after that. At level 3, the river gun can now hold a maximum ammunition in reserve of 50, as well as it gains a new feature. The primary trigger can be held down before the visual charging effect of the rivet occurs after impact, this will cause the rivet to charge even longer, starting with a blue particle and fading to an off-white yellow when fully charged. The fully charged rivet explosion has a much larger splash radius, and deals much more damage.R.A.T.  Rapid Armored Transports, or R.A.Ts are found all over the Wastelands on Iron Star. Their speed allows for quick movement around the less crowded areas of the dangerous Wasteland. The R.A.T can only be seen when you meet up with Krunk either in Droid Town or in the Wasteland. Up to two people can occupy a R.A.T at a time, one driver and one gunner. There is only one Droid Rebellion Rapid Armored Transport, as Krunk had stolen it from unwary Mil Grunts and painted it yellow. The first mission they are seen in is Wastelands: Wasteland Thunder.Wastelands: Wasteland Thunder  Glitch is called back to Base. Glitch is celebrating, but Colonel Alloy breaks the news to Glitch that Vlax has escaped into the Wastelands, and he has to prevent him from revealing the location of Droid Town. Krunk shows him the vehicle he had stolen off the Mils. He fills you in on what the vehicle is and how to use it. You have 4 minutes to get to the far side of the Wastelands otherwise this mission is toast. Vlax is just visible, in a red and purple Mil R.A.T, then, as you progress, increasing numbers of Mil reinforcements arrive to prevent you from stopping Vlax. You have to avoid those as well as bombers that attempt to drop their payload onto your R.A.T. Once you get to the far side of the Wastelands, a cut scene will initiate, stating that Glitch can move faster on foot than he can with the heavy R.A.T. As he leaves to defend himself in the Wastelands, he tells Krunk and Zobby to cut Vlax off at the pass in the Wastelands. Krunk and Zobby escape, with Krunk shouting \"Cut him off at the pass?! Who the hell says that, some sorta fucking cowboy?!! You'd better be right about this screwboy because if you don't stop Vlax ,I will personally weld your exhaust pipe to your ball bearings!!!!\" to Glitch.Vehicles  R.A.T. - A six-wheeled vehicle, the Rapid Armored Transport is typically used to traverse the wastelands of Iron Star, it is featured in several fast-paced levels in the singleplayer campaign, and featuerd in several multiplayer maps. The R.A.T. can run over smaller enemies from almost any angle. What it can't run over, it can shoot apart using the RJV-780 mounted to the back. Loader - A medium-sized yellow-orange hovercraft, not originally intended for the war the laoder has a large mechanical claw attached to the front of it which can be used to pick up smaller robots. After the war became a serious thing the loader became outfitted with an infinite ammunition level 2 SPEW Sentinel - A large war machine built by the Mils for heavy assault on the Droid cities. The Sentinel Tank is armed with a lighter variant of the RJV-780, which fires with less damage and more speed, but oddly enough shares a sound with the SPEW. It's primary weapon is a heavy laser cannon which fires a large burst of energy into a specific targeted area, creating a dramatically large explosion upon impact. RJV-780 20mm (Vorium Machine Gun) - A heavy machine gun which can found mounted to the back of a R.A.T., or to a turret emplacement on the ground of several levels. Fires at a rapid rate which can tear through any bot or vehicle in the game.", "Mega Man Teams Wiki": "Mega Man Teams Wiki Epilogue Characters  Characters that appear in epilogues. Includes roleplaying characters (the game bosses, as portrayed by members of the community), as well as NPCs. NPCs include villains, supporting characters, and other non-player characters can either be taken from official media (not limited to the Megaman games), or be completely original.Sinister Six  The Sinister Six is the team that started it all. Headed by Gary \"Iceman\" Martin the Sinister Six has paved the way for many, many, many other websites to come. After Gary's death it has shut down. Currently it's maintained by The Mechanical Maniacs as a tribute to their old friend Gary. Visit the Sinister Six.Team Roster  Current roster of the Sinister Six\u00a0: Former members of Sinister:Fictional History Pre-Sinister Six  After the events of Megaman 1, the Robot Masters all retired and adopted human-like forms and new names. They lived in obscurity until they read an advertisement ran by the Mayor of Melaopolis' about an audition to form a formal team of heroes to protect the city. Unfortunately S Club 7 got there first and the Six didn't get the job. However, they have no powers and were unable to stop an attacking City Garage in their first outing. With the Club on the ropes and Sinister Six transform and quickly dispatch their adversary. All this was witnessed by a time travelling Magma Dragoon (aka Ben, of the X-Force) who wanted to ensure the Six was chosen as Megalopolis' defenders and the S Club 7. With that done they move into an abandoned mansion at a secret location which becomes their permanent base of operations.Season 1  The Six had many random adventures. They met Nsync and preformed in front of a crowd as the group was trapped in\u00a0 their dressing room. They ruined a game show about Megaman trivia by pretending they didn't know anything about it.\u00a0 The Sinister Six and the X-Force has their first full meeting when Super Chaos was stealing weapons in the X-Force's time. The X-Force rush in to stop him, but the Cyclops teleports them all into the Sinister Six's base, 100 years in the past using a time machine he somehow has (stolen from the Sinister Six? Or maybe the X-Force?) Acting quickly the Six attacks SC while he's boasting of his plans and are sucked into the future, leaving the X-Force in the past. In the future Super Chaos has already planted bombs in Sky Lagoon and Bombman helps the Six to locate and dismantle them shortly before they explode. They then encounter Double who they beat and find Super Chaos just as he finds the living weapon he's looking for. In a rush SC activated his time machine and they all get teleported into the past aboard a space station. SC manages to capture Gary and disappear while the Six bump into the X-F (minus MD) who are also, conveniently, on the space station. Meanwhile, on planet earth, SC has imprisoned MD and Gary in a stadium and forces them to fight, but Mr. Dragoon interrupts their evenly matched fight and points out it's futility. Together they overcome the barrier surrounding their arena and easily beat Super Chaos together. He informs the two that he placed a bomb into the uncontrollable Living Weapon he stole and that it's been activated while the teams are still aboard the space station. After an intense fight both teams manage to still the Living Weapon before it explodes, allowing both teams to escape, minus Edward (Elecman) who had been injured saving Gary and Scott. The resulting explosion presumably killed the Sinister Six member. However, Scorpion was still alive and kicking. News footage of Scorpion on a rampage got the Six out of their malaise after Edward's death and gave them new motivation to keep on going. The battle was intense and the Six got through it tanks to a surprise attack by Andon who joined the team shortly afterwards.\u00a0Season 2  The very first epilogue of Season 2 would give us long time foe \"Iceman Red.\" While Super Chaos is attacking the town on one place Red is attacking in another and Gary heads off to stop his \"clone,\" but misses him before transforming into Ele-lephant and annoying the rest of the team. In \"The Backstreet Project meets the sinister Six\" Red tells Gary about his origins and they're confirmed (In \"The Sinister Six VS The Insidious Six\") by a dream Gary has of the moment Red went berserk and fought Megaman (presumably Red sent him this dream telepathically).\u00a0 In the events of \"Year of the Fox\" Super Chaos, using Mewthree, curses the Six. At first it seems ineffective, but they soon discover he's locked them in their Robot Master form. Later, when fighting Sailor T, Gary is hit with a lightning strike which turns Gary into Spilt Mushroom. Gauntlets hows up to explain that this has made him like DC's Captain Marvel and that he can use the word \"SHAZAM\" to turn back into Iceman (which he does). Meanwhile Ben, who has been turned into Pyro, is on the hunt for his missing X-Force teammates. He targets the villains of the era in his search first - Super Chaos, Dr. Wily, Bass, Scorpion, City Garage, and even George Lucas. They flock to the Sinister Six's base to beg for help and that's when Pyro catches up to them and demands help in finding the X-Force. After an intense fight, in which Pyro holds his own against the entire Sinister Six and Scorpion, he's finally bested by an enraged Andon's Elec Beams and a relatively small fight with Gary (who recognizes him as Ben). After getting him in a hold he's able to forcible change him back by using the word \"SHAZAM\" to call lightning down on both of them, revealing himself to be the new Split Mushroom.\u00a0 After they finish fighting they hear news that Red and Double are attacking the Megalopolis Spaceport. And, somewhere along the line, it's revealed that Mr. Dragoon has escaped to trouble the Mechs in their own adventures. With the other teams busy (and the rest of the Six on ice) Gary and MD team up to stop Double and Red. They reveal they've teamed up, basically, because the X-Force and S6 are friends. Red helps Double kidnap the X-Force. It's a quick battle and both villains retreat. They happen to meet the Backstreet Project there (they were trying to stop Red and Double before MD and the Six showed up) and were happy to help our heroes track Double down to his volcano base in Hawaii. Unfortunately N'synch (and Stan Lee) shows up (Double has given them \"dark amulets\" to give them power and they coerce Stan Lee into helping them ... for a hot minute) and messes that up. Cut and Bomb annoy Stan Lee who turns them into Kirbys.\u00a0 Having defrosted the rest of the Six go to the Mechanical Maniacs to help track down Gary (which they do) and they offhandedly find out Double has purchased the volcano base. They do battle with him and find he's even more powerful than they realized, having absorbed the abilities of many other villains. They battle is interrupted when they receive a warning about the new X-Force.\u00a0 As the fight goes one MD and Gary manage to find and revive the missing members of the X-Force. Double sees them (somehow) and attacks and Cyber Peacock sends the Mechs, the S6 (minus Gary), Stan Lee, and the Backstreet Project to Maui to get them to safety as the X-Force use their overbearing power to defeat Double ... by destroying most of Maui and killing the thousands who live there (although the epilogue ends with everyone laughing and the S6 vacation there in the very next epilogue, so it's all good).\u00a0Season 3  Forte Chan aka Classi Cal makes her first appearance in \"Sinister Six.EXE Part 1\" as the Six run in order to protect her against the rampaging Robot Masters - turned - EXE Navis under the control of the newly made Life Virus. Unfortunately she'd already been turned into Bass.EXE herself. Eventually every robot in the world - including the Mechanical Maniacs, Cossack's Creations, and The Tech Tyrants - became infected until only Cutman was left. The scissor based robot overcame his own doubts and the forces of evil to destroy Life Virus and return everyone to normal. At this point Red, through Neo Dragoon, had destroyed the X-Force's timeline. Gary would survive, but Ben would be reverse-reincarnated as Heatman of Wily's Warriors. In a desperate plan Gary is sent back through time to stop Red before he ever got started, by destroying him before he went back through time and became almost all powerful. The team correctly reasons that Red wasn't sent to the dawn of time as he claimed, but tot he Star Wars universe during Episode 2. Due to Gary's lack of Star Wars knowledge Searchman of the Robotic Raiders would accompany him and Scott would also randomly be chosen. They would have to use a green crystal to get back, however, because the time machine had been damaged (presumably when Red destroyed the X-Force's timeline).\u00a0 During their adventure in episode 2 the team run afoul of Anakin Skywalker, but eventually teams up with him and Obi Wan Kenobi. They quickly proceed to spoil everything about Star Wars to the confused Jedi (who can sense their sincerity) which negates a lot of the entire franchise. With a sense of fairness Yoda uses the Force to find Red for Gary and Red senses it and immediately teleports to the Jedi Council chambers. Gary freaks out on Red, but the latter is just confused about what's going on and doesn't understand why his double would hate him. The Jedi don't sense evil in Red. Gary concludes that spoiling Star Wars for the characters themselves averted the Clone Wars and that they had averted the events that would give Red his enormous power. With the power in the crystal only containing enough power for three being they leave a seemingly-reformed Red with the Jedi and return. However, the timeline hasn't changed at all leaving Gary to wonder where it all went wrong.\u00a0 Ice VS Red stars with an echo of the MM8 opening scene and then shifts to City Garage. After a brief battle the Six hear of a meteor strike on the outskirts of Megalopolis (which, unknown to all, brings the insect-like Pulzar to Earth). While they don't deem it important, Dr. Wily (with Bass at his side) does and, in a fit of unoriginality, goes to the meteor site to steal a potential new energy source. However, something's moving inside the meteor and the power goes out all around the area. After a brief battle with Pulzar both Wily and Bass are injured, but manage to escape and go into hiding. The Six were eating at a local restaurant in their human forms when Thudnerman first confronts them shortly before being caught by police shortly before the electronics went haywire. The cash register displayed symbols in a code Andon quickly deciphered as \"Doomsday has arrived.\" Worried, the Six brought the Mechanical Maniacs in to assist (they were staying at S6 HQ at the time; Ice VS Red happens near the end of the Mech's Series 4). Animals were running wild, the sun was blotted out and plants were quickly dying (including Forte Chan's mango tree). Gary and Tim went to investigate the meteorite and, upon touching it, Gary saw flashes of Pulzar being subdued by Red (whom he didn't recognize).\u00a0 While going out on another patrol Cutman (Jason) lets Gary in on a secret - that he's had enough and wants to quit. Their conversation is interrupted when Thunderman attacks. Their battle is interrupted by a surprise appearance of Pulzar who paralyses the entire group before leaving (without actually doing anything) and leaves Gary unconscious. Gary waves up (in Forte Chan's mango tree home) and the team realizes that Pulzar had left for downtown Megalopolis where the Mechs are patrolling. In the city the Mechs are goofing off instead when Red and Pulzar approaches the team and stops their revelry dead in it's tracks. Snakeman was frozen by Pulzar and the bug quickly hid itself. Soon after a much more powerful Red (disappointed in not finding the Sinister Six) floated down and threatened the Megaman 3 team. Shadowman tried to bribe his way out (threatening to show pictures of Red hitting on Gemnini Red from long ago), but the evil Iceman merely laughed at the ridiculousness of it and countered that he could control the press and reveal Shadowman's use of counterfeit money. Then Geminiman lost his temper and started a physical attack between the Mechs and Red who was either impervious to attacks or simply phased through them. He deliberately put Needlegal into the line of fire from a powered-up Gemini Lazer causing great damage to Shadowman's sister to the point where she went into stasis lock. Enraged, Shadowman attacked Red, who easily overpowered him. After an impressive display of power in which he turned into clouds, caused a storm, and shot hail at the Mechs, Red disappeared and the Mechs went back to S6 HQ to recuperate. There, Shadowman explains what happened after Gary left Red in the Star Wars universe and relates that to Gary (explaining that he used the time travel device to observe events as a phantom; which is all he could do as it was broken beyond repair). Gary took a stroll, pondering Red's origins and his role in them when he spotted Thudnerman. Thunder muttered to himself about the S6 abandoning him and leapt off to S6 Mansion, but not before he was overheard by a skulking Super Chaos who followed him, with an idea about who he was. Thunder attacked the Six at the headquarters; their defences being down as they recognized the intruder as Edward. However, he was unprepared for the Mechs and together they captured Thunderman. The Six angrily questioned their captured foe when Jason pieced together his identity based on his intimate knowledge of the team. The team ponders this as Thunder reveals Red had saved him. After this reveal they leave to find Pulzar (thinking he's gone to attack Forte Chan's bakery, based off a pattern Andon has figured out), but don't manage to find him. Meanwhile Gary has made his way to where the Mechs had battled Pulzar, seeing it as a good starting place. Using intuition he discovered thousands of Neo Dragoon copies slumbering in capsules. A computer greeted Gary as Red and gave Iceman the identity of the villain behind this plot. Gary quickly attempts to get the computer to halt the Neo Dragoon production and destroy those already made, but it doesn't recognize his voice. It's then that Gary is attacked by Pulzar and Gary realises Red was the one who had tamed the beast. After a chase Gary managed to escape the beast thanks to quick thinking, a conveniently placed hoverboard, and a last-minute assist from Super Chaos. and the security systems, but didn't manage to destroy Red's \"Army of Darkness\".\u00a0 Gary rejoined the Six and was told Edward was Thunderman. Unfortunately Pulzar was hot on his heels (Gary having to run because he didn't have enough energy to teleport away). This time Andon had a flash of inspiration and reversed the electrons in this Thunder Beam, making the energy unstable or \"bad\" for the creature. Still, Andon alone wasn't enough to stop the creature so Gary, thinking quickly, teleported himself, Andon, and Pulzar to the power plant. There they turned\u00a0 Meanwhile the Mechs were working on reviving Needlegal by repairing her systems just enough to be able to turn into their Navi forms from their Viral Infection days (Topman as Gutsman.EXE and Shadowman as Shadowman.EXE) in order to repair her system from the inside. Working quickly the Navis sensed the large collection of \"bad energy\" in the power plant area and stopped by, disrupting the systems in the place, giving a much-needed distraction that allowed the Six to get through Pulzar's defences. First Cutman chopped off Pulzar's horn (which allowed the creature to control it's dark energy) and the Guts followed up by plunging a plant's worth of energy (which Andon had \"turned bad\") into the bug, killing it. Unfortunately Pulzar crushed Cutman's torso during the battle, seriously injuring the Sinister Six member. Soon after, however, Cutman was repaired and Needlegal was restored as well. Unfortunately, even with Pulzar's death the planet was still dying and there was still Red's army of Neo Dragoons to account for. The Six decided to call in even more help including the Gutsman-to-be Windman, Xardion, Clownman, Wily's Warriors (including Ben as Heatman), Forte Chan, Groovy Ket, Drizl, Sola, Super Chaos, Ridley, and anyone else with a connection to the Sinister Six (including all the people who would make up the new Sinister Six). No sooner were the heroes assembled than the Neo Dragoons were released. After a rousing speech by Lennon the 300 Megaman Community members the Six assembled were ready for battle. Disguised as a horde of Magma Dragoons the MM army attacked the astonished Neo Dragoons with their leader leaping to the fore to confront his father (who was also disguised as Magma Dragoon). Unfortunately, although Ben tried to distract Neo by pushing his buttons, the mad Dragoon saw through his father's weak attacks and soon peeled off his armour to reveal Heatman. With their disguises useless the Megaman army reformed into ranks and used coordinated attacks against the Dragoons (as opposed to the melee from before). Unfortunately, despite well-coordinated attacks, sheer numbers and power tipped the battle in favour of the Neo Dragoon army. Meanwhile Gary set out to confront his evil twin. After a brief stop at the warehouse the Neo Dragoon were created in (and finding it completely erased) Gary teleported to the meteor crash site, hoping to use it to once mare establish a mental link with Red in order to discover his location. Unfortunately Thunderman was waiting for him (having been rescued by Red). Gary confronted his former friend using wooden mallets to nullify Thunder's electric attacks. Totally under Red's influence Thunder wouldn't stop his attacks forcing Gary to impale him on a large icicle, seemingly killing him. Gary's wounds quickly healed enough for him to consult the meteor and find Red in a general sense which Gary could use to pinpoint Red more exactly. Red wasn't far and Gary confronted him. After a quick conversation Gary attacked his double. Unfortunately Red was super powerful and Gary found himself overwhelmed. As Gary was bounced around in an unconscious state the sprites of the departed X-Force members imbued him with their power (and the power lost to the surviving members, which they still had access to), including that of their Perfect Forms. This healed his wounds and allowed him to use attacks that actually hurt the powerful Iceman Red. The two fought and Gary used his new strength to beat back his double. It seemed all was lost when Red severed Gary's left hand, but Gary turned it into a buster and fired a blast containing all the powers of the X-Force at Red, debilitating the evil robot. In desperation Red pulled at the fabric of reality in order to destroy the present timeline as he did to the X-Force's (saving a little bit of power to shunt himself backwards in time to start again).\u00a0 Using the last of the X-Force's power Gary created a shield-vortex trapping himself and the mad Iceman Red in it's centre. He used Red's own reality-destroying entropy to use for this vortex, managing to take control of it due to Red's surprise at his tactic (with strategies possible gleamed from his own mental connection to Red). Red tackled him in frustration, abandoning his escape plan. In his final moments Red seemed to be freed of the evil that consumed him for so long and he and Gary understood each other. Then the vortex collapsed and both Gary and Red died. With Red destroyed the Neo Dragoon army simply stopped in it's tracks and fell apart and the original Neo Dragoon fled. The Six went looking for Gary and found a strange light which relayed the battle between Ice and Red. When the scene was finished the five remaining Sinister Six members gained their own Transmetal armours, a parting gift from Iceman.\u00a0 After Ice VS Red the Six aided the Mechanical Maniacs in stopping a Decepticon invasion and taking down Galvatron once and for all.\u00a0\u00a0Pre-Season 4: The New Team's Unwritten Origin  \u00a0In her bio Britt makes no mention of having died at the army of Neo Dragoon's hands and instead says she put herself in a coma after she found out Gary died. At some point she and Ice get into a relationship. The transition from the original Six to the \"new\" Sinister Six was never shown in an actual epilogue, but several hints were dropped in notes and in their intro epilogue (written by Gauntlet, it was created long after the new team had formed) and even morel hints were dropped around over time in bios and character information pages and ideas on how that came about came and went. This is an attempt to string them all together cohesively, making up details when necessary. After Gary's death the original S6 disbanded and disappeared. Seeing his chance Dr. Wily decided to make his own version of the team in order to fuel his desire for world conquest. For some reason the original members of the Sinister Six abandon their Transmetal Amours and Dr. Wily managed to obtain them. The mad scientist decided to use the personalities of some of the fallen community members from the battle with Red - Erik (Windman), Britt (\"Quickie\" or Quickman), Odin, and Rich. Under Nth's secret influence Wily also decides to clone Heatman's personality (which he has easy access to as Wily's Warriors began to work for him at this point), however things go wrong and Fireman winds up mellower and delusional. Things go even worse for Wily as the new Six turn against him, overcoming a control chip he placed into them. Seeing their chance to revive Gary in some way they program the new Iceman with Gary's personality and their own experiences with him, happy that they're able to have him back in some way. The new Six's first real adventure was against Kefka. Nobody quite knows what happened during this adventure, but they managed to save the world from the villain and, perhaps in this adventure, found out that copy Gary hid his consciousness within the Transmetal amour, so copy Gary became the true Gary. Gary would save Cut Chan's life before it was all over.Season 4  The New Sinister Six first met the old Sinister Six in the second Megaman Superhero convention. The dialogue makes it clear that they haven't met before this and they're friendly towards each other. During the reality warping \"Crisis on Earth Capcom\" the Six meet their Powered Up compatriots, Timeman and Oilman. Despite moist of the anomalies of that adventure being cleared up at the end these two persisted.\u00a0 After a few adventures Elecman (Odin) receives a call from Scorpion saying that the time has come to betray the team. Odin leads them all to a warehouse and they're ambushed by Scorpion and a revived Pulzar as Odin abandons his Elecman armour, claiming Scorpion offered him power in exchange for his betrayal. Unfortunately for the villains the factory's also int he sights of several bounty hunters (Samus, Squall, and the new Elecman - Leon (already in his Transmetal Elecman armour) who leap into fight them when it;s clear they're going to be trouble. Odin managed to kill Squall, but Erick and Ben manage to snatch his sword away from him and (seemingly) kill him with it. Quickly turning their attention to the revived Pulzar they use the sword to kill him as well. With that Scorpion retreats and Samus betrays Leon and ditches him so that only she can collect the reward money (unfortunately for her Scorpion was hiding on the ship and kills her in cold blood).\u00a0 Nearing the end of Season 4, the Six face against the Six Squad and defeat them easily. Odin also showed up (after seemingly dying int he last adventure) only to be turn himself over peacefully when confronted by Leon and Britt. Wondering at this the Six are relieved when an alarm sounds, relieving themselves of boredom. They meet Apple, who's using her wiles to easily rob a jewelry store. There she uses her magic to drive the men crazy as she makes her escape. This happens twice again until she's confronted by Cut who, as a woman, is immune to her charms. They engage in a physical fight, but Apple uses the other members of the Six to best her. Cut returns with the other female team members including Needlegal, Spark Chan (Classi), Toad Girl (Zapper), Bright Babe (Jet), and Crystal Girl (Crys). Together they hold the other Sinister Six members back as Cut Chan dispatches Apple.\u00a0 In the Season 4 finale Scorpion orchestrates a series of crimes throughout Megalopolis, ambushing each of the members who are sent in to stop them. Scorpion's minions include the Sleek Squad, Super Chaos, Apple, Flame Mammoth (who is a TV actor they've seen in prior epilogues), Soviet Commando (who just showed up out of nowhere), another clone of Pulzar, and Odin. They capture the Six, but they are found and rescued by Time Girl and Oil man who want to join the team. After refusing them they leave and the Six take on Scorpion's team member individually (with the Sleek Squad all fighting Gary as a group). Naturally they manage to prevail this time, using intelligence and luck (and Pulzar dies again). Scorpion sends Odin after the team and he holds his own, but is eventually defeated. Despite all this Scorpion manages to get away with a weapon he's building. Soviet Commando limps away and swears off villainy.Season 5  In another adventure it appears as though the old Sinister Six have gone bad, including an old version of Gary. They fight, but are evenly matched with the old S6 having experience and the new countering with superior firepower. They try settling things with a contest, but the two teams wind up tying. They decide to settle it with a tie breaker. The New S6 win thanks to a drunken IRA interfering with the race. With the old S6 defeated Minion reveals himself to have been the old Iceman in disguise (and with a Gary personality program guiding his actions). He, being quite the sportsman, released the old S6 from his hypnosis. In the end the entire scheme was shown to be a plot by General Cutman.\u00a0 The final S6 adventure starts with the S6 investigating Super Chaos' murder. They begin their investigation at the Sinister Six PC's base where they discover that it's been trashed. Parts of the PC team are everywhere (Zero tracked them down on a whim and destroyed them all, although the heroes don't know this at the time). They're then confronted by the culprits - Scorpion, Odin, and Neo Dragoon. The team tries to point out that they aren't the ones Neo is even angry at, but unhinged Dragoon has none of it and fights the team. Scorpion is content to watch, but Odin decides to challenge his successor as that fight is going on, but they're interrupted by Neo who wants the entire team to himself. However, Fireman, healed by Nth, takes on his \"son\" all on his own and the S6 attack Scorpion. This doesn't last for long as Fireman and Neo Dragoon use their posers to heat up the base beyond anyone's tolerance. They hit a gas main causing the entire place to explode taking out both Ban and Neo Dragoon. The Six are rescued from the explosion by Nth who reveals himself to be a future version of Gary. He laments about not being able to save Ben and about other contradictory events before disappearing and his base aging and collapsing; his fate having been changed. The Six black out and awaken at the dump, unharmed and meet Time and Oil who say they rescued them from an inferno. Days later (story time) the other teams are occupied and the Six resolve to ask Ben (Heat) to take Ben (Fire)'s spot. They (along with Time and Oil) immediately head towards the very boarders of Skull Castle to invite Heatman to the team only to find the base in ruins. They have a short conversation with Bass before the robot passes out from his injuries. The Six sift through the rubble when the old Sinister Six arrive to help. They decide a break's in order and the teleport to S6 HQ to catch up. It lasts until the S6 pass out, having been drugged. They wake up to find the mansion engulfed in flames with Oilman screaming in pain. Outside Apple watches the mansion fall apart with the old S6 completely under her power. Time Girl's power allows the Six to escape and they fight Apple and the old S6. Thanks to the element of surprise and more powerful attacks the new Six manage to defeat the old S6, and Dr. Light programmed barriers to stop Apple's influence. But she isn't out of tricks and sends a mutated Mega Blooper and Muffinman to attack the heroes. On Muffinman's urging Blooper attacks the team with electricity, injuring them all but injuring Gary worst of all. In desperation Leon turns his attack against him killing their old. Muffinman attacks himself, but is quickly dispatched. The robot police come in to mop up and take Apple and the old S6 away. Tim (still under Apple's influence) tells Erik to get the guy who sent Apple (and the rest of them) against the S6 - General Cutman (while also revealing that it was the General who's been behind the tragic events of the last week). The Six were given the co-ordinates to the General 's base - a factory outside of Yumland where he greets them personally. He summons the Sleek Squad and reveals that he was responsible for their creation (as he had manipulated the police bots at the time to do his bidding). He then summons Scorpion, Odin, a remade Super Chaos, and a remade Neo Dragoon (in the image of Transmetal Fireman using what he could find of Ben as a base). This was possible using the Necronomicon (which he acquired in a Wily's Warriors adventure) and his own genius. They all fight until Scorpion managed to nail Gary with Cybervenom. The heroes stop as the General promises to heal Gary in exchange for their surrender.\u00a0 The S6 were placed in a cell within General Cutman's lab along with Kefka (who is in another cage and hooked up to machinery). They see that the General has tame dup with their entire rogues gallery including Minion, Gassman, Buster Rod G, and City Garage. In a conversation with an impatient Scorpion the General reveals that he doesn't intend to kill the sinister Six, but to reprogram them and use their fame and influence for his own ends and that Scorpion himself isn't an equal partner in their venture. He also reveals that he killed the original Odin and replaced him with a copy. Scorpion turns to all of the S6 villains, but they're fully behind the General . Enraged the doomsday weapon attacks, but he's quickly felled by General Cutman and Odin (with the General remarking that he'd bring him back smarter). Using the Necronomicon and his machinery General Cutman transforms Gary into a new Iceman Red, killing Kefka in the process. As that's going on, however, the base is attacked by the Sinister Six's old friends, the Backstreet Project. As the General is busy reviving red Britt talks the copy of Odin, who still has the power to absorb electricity, into freeing the Six (and Time). Angered, General Cutman deactivated the damaged copy remotely. As they fight Kefka dies and the Necronomicon erupts into flames. Red is reborn! But things don't go as expected for the General as Red turns on his, angered by the kill switch in his head (which he deactivated). They're about to battle when Neo stumbled into the factory and explodes, killed by Wily's latest creation - Zero, who has also killed the Sleek Squad and the Backstreet Project. The factory erupts into chaos as ed, Zero, and General Cutman fight each other with the Six and all the villains caught in the middle. During the fight General Cutman's Scissor Army is revealed (this incarnation is a mass of General Cutman copies without the intelligence) and he unleashes it against Zero and Red. In the battle Zero and Red gain a mutual respect and vow to save each other for last a they kill Super Chaos one last time. After a large explosion Red kills Buster Rod offhandedly and Rich faces against General Cutman himself. Dazed from the explosion Rich is able to pummel the normally agile robot. Bombman produced one last bombs and forcefully holds General Cutman in place to ensure victory. Both are caught in the explosion and that's the end of the General (for now). With the General gone Gasman loses his nerve and Minion turns on him, but is dispatched by Zero before he can do much else.\u00a0 With General Cutman gone the factory's auto destruct sequence activates. Gary tosses Leon around and Britt pleads with him to stop. Red asserts that he's no longer Gary, but hesitates. Zero decided to \"help\" red by blowing a hole through Cut Chan which causes the Gary part of Red to assert dominance. In short order Red uses his power to destroy Zero, blowing up this version of Wily's creation once and for all. Afterwards Red vanishes and the Iceman we know is once again in full control of his faculties. Before the Six can do much else the factory explodes.\u00a0 At the last minute Time uses her power to slow time and Gary used the remains of Red's powers to shield the team from the explosion. Battered the Six survive, but everyone, especially Gary is extremely damaged. It's revealed that Wily's restored his forces and the old S6 was released from prison. Unfortunately they've been locked into their \"human\" forms with their power chips removed. Their days as crime fighters have come to an end. Time Girl also decided to retire as a way of moving on after Oil's demise. In a tragic echo of real life, however, the epilogue version of Gary fell down the stairs and died because of complication arising from his injuries in battle.Post Sinister Six  Each member of the Six would go their separate ways for a time. Rich would up dying in WANTED to give closure to his younger brother Kenta Eigen. The rest of the Sinister Six would return once more during the Business of War. A revived General Cutman kidnapped his old enemies and brainwashed them into being his last line of defence, giving himself the powers of Fireman and Iceman in addition to his own and granting Britt Bombman's powers. Ultimately they were all defeated and the remainder of the Six helped the Mechs fight the Scissor Army in the War's final moments. At the end a very different Gary from General Cutman's own reality crossed over into the main timeline and helped deliver the final blow against Mesmerman. The Sinister Six all decided to go with him back to his own reality in order to help him restore it to some semblance of normality (although Leon eventually returned). For more information visit the Mechanical Maniacs Timeline.Characters and Other Notes Sprites representing the team  These were the original sprites used for the Sinister Six in their series.\u00a0   After a time, they gained \"Transmetal Armour\".Code: Island Attackers  Code: Island Attackers is the official Mega Man X2 Team. The original site went live on July 5th, 2004. Since then, the Island Attackers, led by Rebel, have had many adventures and currently are working on the fourth \"series\" of their adventures. Their original slogan was \"The 'official' Mega Man X2 Team\", used from 2004 to 2006, followed by \"Rawking the night away since 2004!\" from 2007 to mid 2008, to their current slogan, \"Beating up the X-Hunters since 2004!\". Although not the first X2 Team, it is the longest running to date.Cast List  The current full cast, as seen on the Island Attacker site!The Attackers  The current main cast of Code: Island Attackers!The Villains  The guys that either just get in the way or actually pose a threat to the Island Attackers!Former Members  Those that somehow found their sanity and ran. That, or life just got in the way and they couldn't help as much as they wanted.Supporting Cast  While there have been many cameos, none of the other characters have been seen in more than one or two epilogues. Well, save for the crossover with the X1 Team, Alpha Movement, but that's a crossover, and thus, not applicable to the standard rules of engagement.Epilogues  The bulk of the Island Attackers adventures!Series 1: The Beginning  The original series, the Island Attackers battle everyday villains such as the X-Hunters to prove their worth as heroes. Many other trademark villains appear here, such as Donald Trump, Frankenploid, and Anti-Majin. Among other events the CIA's first member, Ti-An, leaves the team and is replaced by Majin, along with a mysterious foreshadowing to future events...Series 2: Into the Unknown  Although it starts off similarly to Series 1, many things happen behind-the-scenes in Series 2, which comes out into the open halfway, known as the \"Dark Epilogues\". By the end of the series Anti-Majin, originally a minor character, teams up with Frank and a new guy named Ryouga and decimates the Island Attackers, who are force to regroup. The series itself ends with a SIX-PART CROSSOVER with Alpha Movement.\n\n*These are not CIA members but rather on separate teams.Series 3: War of the Past  In this, the third of a so far unknown number of series, the Island Attackers are still in the midst of the \"Dark Epilogues\" and have to face off against Anti-Majin's forces, along with a collection of new villains. This series also formally introduces the CIA's new \"Hyper Forms\", powerful upgrades which alters the members' appearance and abilities. Concluding the series is a two-part epilogue, tying many loose ends together.Series 4: No More Shades  After the climatic Series 3, Series 4 reveals the consequences of the events that previously took place. Many new troubles arise due to the wonders of \"cause and effect\", such as the introduction of The Rat and his gang, along with the formation of the New X-Hunters. All of these schemes inevitably lead to Yuber as the root of it all...Specials  Grouped together with the respective series they are released under, specials are exactly that: Works of fiction that do not fit with the epilogues but are still considered to be canon. The first was Wheel Gator's Journal, introduced back during the early stages of Series 2, and since then, more have been introduced. Currently, there have been a total of seven specials released, three for both Series 2 and 3, and one for Series 4.Community Portal  Welcome to the wiki!

Megaman Teams are Megaman webpages co-managed by several members, and each member plays as one Robot Master from any given Mega Man game. They have become very popular in ten years, and although many teams have died off, a good number are still around today, based around lots of different games in the Mega Man series. It's a great way to show creativity and a good source of fun. You could say it's a game about other games. Only one team is allowed per game, and no main robot characters (such as Mega Man, Proto Man, Roll, Bass, X, Zero, Axl, etc.) or humans may be featured as characters on a team\u2014 although, there were a couple exceptions to the rule that only the boss characters in the game can be played as before any official list of rules was made (for example, the The Mechanical Maniacs had both a Gemini Blue and a Gemini Red throughout most of 2001). Games that may not be used to create a team are the games with no original characters (such as Mega Man Soccer or Mega Man Powered Up). It seems like the only characters that are playable on two different teams are Tenguman and Astroman (they were in both Mega Man 8 and Mega Man & Bass, where the two Robot Masters were reused as bosses alongside six new characters. Several, but not all, Megaman & Bass Teams have featured these two). The basics that a team needs to survive would be a site with profiles for every member, epilogues and regular updates. Teams will not considered canon until they have a site with the profiles for every member (and, often, at least one epilogue). If a canon team does not make any progress in several months, it will lose its canonicity and the game that it was based on will be considered available for the taking. Nonplayable Teams exist as well. The three Nonplayable Teams were the first teams in each of three series: The Sinister Six, based on the original 1987 Mega Man game; the X-Force, based on Mega Man X4; and Viral Infection, based on Mega Man Battle Network. No canon teams may be formed to replace these; the Nonplayable Teams are no longer active, but they're considered \"closed\" rather than non-canon so that they will be remembered for their huge impact on the Megaman Team Community.REX Barron  I see that you've stumbled upon my account page\u2026 So good of you to come here. I'm a relatively new member to the team scene, having stumbled upon the Mechanical Maniacs' site for the first time in early June 2007. However, I am already known there for having produced a good deal of writing in the classic teams project that is near its end as well as for my dedication to my art. Just looking at the picture below will reveal two of my three team personas. I am Saturn of the Cosmic Gladiators as well as Mattrex, the leader of Critical Mass. (Also, I'll have to give some credit to SpinningDemon for the painting of Saturn; I drew and colored the Mattrex half of the picture, but I can't paint to save my life!) http://i118.photobucket.com/albums/o116/The_Ancient_Warrior/NewSignature.png However, I have also been accepted quite recently as the Reploid Rebellion's new Infinity Mijinion. Hopefully I'll have a picture of him up sometime soon\u2026X-Hunters  The X-Hunters are a band of Reploid mercenaries designed for the sole purpose of countering both the Maverick Hunters and Mega Man X. Their members consist of Serges, Agile, and Violen. Currently they are battling Code: Island Attackers on a regular basis, and failing fabulously. Recently they team was disbanded and reformed as the \"New X-Hunters\" composed of Serges, Balrog, and Misery.Profile  \"When the going gets tough... run away!\"Members Serges  Serges is, without a doubt, the true leader of the X-Hunters. A scientist by nature, he boasts the highest I.Q. in the group, which allows him to create plans and machines to cause trouble. Unfortunately, his intelligence has been dropping in recent years... probably from old age. It was Serges who suggested taking on the Island Attackers for the first time in fact, which is a choice he has come to regret. Ever since losing to them they have become more and more pathetic, to the point where they are utter laughingstocks in the world of villains. Despite this, Serges still remains the most intelligent and is the most embarrassed by his teammates acts, especially Violen. He has developed a strong rivalry against the Attackers own scientist, Void Darkheart, and hopes to one day prove himself once more by besting him. Eventually, thanks to his frustration at his incompetent partners, Serges became the next bearer of the mythical Demon Crown, causing two servants bound to the crown named Balrog and Misery to appear. Realizing this was his chance, Serges kicked Agile and Violen off the team, forming the \"New X-Hunters\" with his new minions.Balrog  A strange gray, box-like creature, Balrog's origins have been debated for a long time. He is a servant of the peculiar Demon Crown, forced to follow the orders of whoever wears it. How he became involved in such a situation is unknown, however. After Serges acquired the power of the Demon Crown, Balrog was summoned forth, although a bit late. Despite this fact, his companion, Misery, has made certain to use him as a tank of sorts, letting him handle all of the fights that the group has gotten involved in, much to his dismay. Furthermore, despite being a member of Serges' New X-Hunters, Balrog has shown to be a rather nice guy, even offering the CIA the chance to avoid fighting him if they wanted. Balrog's exact origins is unknown. No one knows exactly what he is. Some say he is a lunchbox, others a television, others a microwave. The list goes on and on. What is known is that he is one of the two servants tied to the Demon Crown, the other being Misery. This means that Balrog is forced to follow all orders to the bearer of the crown with little say on the matter. Since he lacks Misery's brains, he is sometimes treated as a punching bag and is left to do most of the dirty work, much to his dismay. He always shouts out \"Huzzah!\" right before appearing. He is also a part of Serges' New X-Hunters.Misery  Bearing the appearance of a young, pale-skinned woman, Misery is a witch who helped create the frighteningly powerful Demon Crown. Due to her role, however, she became bound to whomever wore the crown and is forced to serve the role as a mere servant. When Serges finally placed the Demon Crown atop his head, Misery appeared to offer her services. From learning the power of the crown he possessed, Serges disbanded the X-Hunters and formed the \"New X-Hunters\" with Misery in his ranks. While a powerful, however, she mostly leaves the grunt work to her companion, Balrog, preferring to watch from the sidelines and take all of the glory.Former Members Agile  Agile is not the leader of anything, although he always tries to be. It is mostly due to his outward appearance compared to his friends that he is usually treated as the leader of \"something\", however. Despite this, Agile lacks leadership abilities and sometimes his logic is questionable at best. Ever since fighting against the Island Attackers, Agile has found himself becoming extremely abused, getting the living daylights beaten out of him on a regular basis. While his teammates also get beaten up regularly as well, Agile receives more than double the pain. Plus, due to his girly appearance, some people think that he has turned emo, but he denies all of these claims. Finally, due to said girly appearance, Agile has become rather sexist, not thinking much of women and believing that he has to prove how manly he is toward them. Little does he realize that no one, much less women, think of him period. After Serges broke up the original X-Hunters, Agile went on a journey with Violen to locate their former comrade and reunite the team, even going so far to not accept the Island Attackers' help.Violen  Violen is considered to be mostly \"muscle\". Unfortunately, he is also considered to be big, slow, and not the sharpest knife in the drawer. Despite this, he is very powerful, and has a strong defense. It were these qualities which made him the perfect choice for Agile and Serges. When it came to dealing with the Island Attackers, however, Agile and Serges discovered some of Violen's \"hobbies.\" Violen is a huge fan of the show \"I Love Lucy,\" where he goes out of his way to watch every episode and collect any merchandise that may come into existence. Furthermore, it was discovered that despite his outward appearance Violen is actually very sensitive and cries very easily. So what the X-Hunters truly have is a big kid who has a low intelligence on their team. In fact, he is so downright pathetic that even his own teammates laugh at him directly in his face (especially Agile). To say something good, however, Violen does have his moments but they are extremely few and far between. When the X-Hunters were disbanded by Serges, Violen started to follow Agile in hopes of reuniting the team once more. No one knows what happened to his \"I Love Lucy\" collectibles during all of this.Background  The X-Hunters were all designed by Sigma. In essence, from the moment they were activated they were Mavericks, making them purebred killing machines. After Sigma's first defeat at the hands of Mega Man X, the X-Hunters took a large batch of Mavericks and moved to a small island close to their headquarters at the North Pole. It was their they continued with their operations--to resurrect Zero by collecting his body parts and his control chip, which was stored at the Maverick Hunters' base. When X started interfering with their plans, however, they engaged him in battle. After a long and brutal war the X-Hunters were eventually all destroyed, their plan ultimately ending in failure. Through unknown methods, however, the trio was eventually revived. Knowing Sigma would not accept them back into his ranks, they decided to turn their attention on Code: Island Attackers. Serges discovered that the members were the Mavericks that assisted their plans but were destroyed, but like them they were somehow resurrected. Unlike them, however, the Island Attackers decided to become good, which Serges despised and felt that it was best to put them in their place. As they fought the CIA, however, the X-Hunters were constantly defeated, causing them to quickly become laughingstocks in the community. The X-Hunters have done much to prove themselves. At one point they worked for Donald Trump and at other points they even teamed up with the Island Attackers themselves to thwart a common enemy. Despite this fact, the team broke up when Serges grew tired of Agile and Violen's random stupidity. Afterward Serges established the \"New X-Hunters\", composed of himself and his two new minions named Balrog and Misery. Currently, Serges, who is now in possession of the Demon Crown, plans to destroy the Island Attackers and then move on to world domination.Spade  Spade is an enemy of the Armored Assassins. A maniacal, cheerful jester with a knack for killing, his outrageous behaviour and unpredictability make him a deadly (and amusing) foe.Profile Personality  A performer at heart, Spade is obsessed with comedic theatre, stage magic, and gambling. He kills for fun and kills in a very dramatic way each time. He loves things that look flashy and each of his attacks fits accordingly. He's also fond of stage magic themed attacks, random but dangerous gags and props, and card themed attacks. He is very dramatic in everything he does, and has a tendency to laugh manically to himself when amused, which is often. Overall he is psychopathic, spastic, and dramatic, and cares nothing for anything save for amusing himself and, so he hopes, others. He has no true face to speak of, and changes his masks instantly to change \"expressions\" by obscuring his face for a breif moment with his hand or some other object.Weapons/Abilities  Spade is an acrobat, so he is agile and nimble, and also has superior reflex speeds to aid with his circus acts. This makes him hard to make contact with. He also has very long reach with his limbs and is unnaturally flexible. He also has a talent for murder and gambling.Trivia Index  Welcome to the Mega Man Teams Wiki forum! This forum can be used by members of this community to discuss topics related to their wiki.

These Councils are elected by the people every sixty days. Council members from each County also act as members of the English Parliament. Up until December 28, 1458, the King of England had been the Administrator LJS acting in his role as LongJohnSilver. With the introduction of the Elected Sovereign role in RK, King LongJohnSilver abdicated his throne on December 28, 1458. The first Sovereign election then took place in order to determine who would become King for approximately the next six months in England. The three candidates were Kenrich of Stafford, United_we_stand of Cumberland, Viceroy of Sussex. After receiving the highest number of votes, on December 29, 1458, Viceroy was elected to rule as the Sovereign of England. Upon his death on April 21, 1459, his wife and heir Cordelia McDermott-Mortimer became Regent. In the Summer of 1459, a new election was held and Faheud of Sussex was elected King of England.

The items of clothing that weavers make are necessary for players to level up.Weaver Facts Clothing Simulator  To see what different items of clothing look like on a character: Hyperwardrobe or Gilded WeavePricing  Pricing of the items usually undergoes the following formula: Cost of raw materials * quantity used + daily wage = price For example: assuming 1 ball of wool costs 12 pounds, and your daily wage = 24 pounds, 1 shirt = 8 balls of wool * 12 + 24 = 120 pounds Prices for wool and hides and the standard salary for level 2 professions can vary widely from town to town and over time. Ask other weavers, your mayor or town mentor what is normal.Kingdom of Scotland  The Kingdom of Scotland or Kingdom of Alba is one of the three English-speaking nations of Renaissance Kingdoms.Counties of Scotland  There are currently 2 counties and 7 towns in Scotland.Government Current Structure of the Government of Scotland  Scotland is ruled by a mostly elected Sovereign, currently His Majesty Wallace Kerr, King of Scots. The Sovereign in turn appoints an Heir, currently His Highness Flaithbheartach de Innes-Kerr, Prince of Scots, and various Lord Officers of the Crown, via whom he or she attempts to exercise royal power. The current Crown Officers are as follows: The Lord/Lady Secretary of Scots (IG) is the Crown Officer responsible for communication between the Sovereign and the outside world, especially the general population of Scotland. The incumbent is Her Ladyship Eira Thorsdottir Kerr. The Lord/Lady Treasurer of Scots (IG) is the Crown Officer responsible for managing royal finances. The incumbent is Her Ladyship Tygorsia Angith. The Lord/Lady Marischal of Scots (IG) is the Crown Officer responsible for the military security of Scotland and the personal safety of the Sovereign. The incumbent is His Lordship Rothgar Thorsson Kerr. The Lord/Lady Chaplain of Scots (RP) is the Crown Officer responsible for the personal religious requirements and observations of the Sovereign. The incumbent is His Lordship Statler of Kirkcudbright. The Lord/Lady Lyon King of Arms (RP) is the Crown Officer responsible for the administration and practice of Heraldry throughout Scotland. The incumbent is His Lordship Korna Fraser.Former Structure of the Government of Scotland  The National Government of Scotland collapsed in early 1458, the following is what the Government consisted of; A. The King of Scotland B. The Three Estates C. The Royal Scottish Army D. The Royal Embassy of ScotlandScotland's Clans  The original Founding Clans of Scotland were named on November 1, 1455 by the Lord Lyon, King of Arms. All current Clans listed as (recognized by the Lyon Court) are all current clans. Regardless of Activity, they are all considered official clans (this does not apply to unofficial ones) until there are 0 remaining members. All other clans are listed with sub forum links in Gathering of the clans, many have or will in the future apply for Official Clan Status through the Lyon Court.Religion in Scotland  The Kingdom of Scotland is a secular state in that there is no official state religion and all its citizens are granted freedom of religion by the Constitution of Scotland. However the majority of the Scottish people are adherents to either the Old Ways, commonly called Paganism by others, the Universal Roman Aristotelian Church (URAC), or the Episcopal Church of Scotland.Universal Roman Aristotelian Church  The URAC in Scotland contains one Province - the Province of Glasgow, which contains the Archdiocese of Glasgow and the Diocese of Whithorn. The Archbishop of Glasgow is Statler and the Bishop of Whithorn is Statler (temporarily).Paganism  As Paganism is not one regulated religious institution, but rather a large variety of beliefs, it does not have a single governance such as the URAC does. However many minor adherents to Pagan beliefs are members of the Alliance of Independent Religions (AIR), which is an association of all \"unofficial\" religions. The Seanchaidhe of the Isles is Conchobhor.Episcopal Church of Scotland  The Episcopal Church of Scotland is one of the smaller churches in Scotland, but besides the URAC is the only independent church in Scotland led by a Scottish pope. The Celtic Aristotelian Church still has some form of power in Scotland, but much of the CAC moved to Ireland. The ECS has four cardinal dioceses, two archdioceses, and several Dioceses within Scotland.Meet the Scots  A Aresius B Brother Chris C Cecci D Dee Snider, Dusk_ E Elois, EricVermulen\u00a0, Evan T\u00a0 F Flaithbheartach G Gabria, Gilan H I Ian.de.Brus J JuliusOctavius K Kimo\u00a0Kat.

Some items of clothing are required to level up to level 2 and level 3. (See weaver guide for specifics on materials needed to make clothing)Clothing Production  The different items which can be made require differing amounts of wool, hides or a combination of both. Wool and hides can be bought on the market or produced by the player themselves if they have a sheep ranch (which is generally advised for weavers). The wool and hides need to be placed in the property's inventory in order to be used for making clothes. One working day (1 Action) is needed to make each item of clothing (with the exception of shoes which can be made in sets of 2 pairs).Clothing Simulator  To see what different items of clothing look like on a character: Hyperwardrobe(men) Hyperwardrobe(women) Gilded Weave (women and men)Sheep  Sheep are a type of field, specifically a ranch. Up to four sheep are available for each ranch. Each sheep costs 35 pounds to purchase from the sheriff. When nourished every day, sheep will maintain weight or improve it (an average of once every three days). Sheep ranchers are encouraged to join The Sheep's Owners and Weavers Guild (SOW). The following are the available weights: dying, bony, lean, normal, fleshy, plump, fat, obese, American-style. (They rarely get beyond normal by the way) Every three days (or every day, or any day...) sheep can be sheared for wool. Every single day a sheep gains 0.5 of wool on their pelt. They can be slaughtered for hides at any point in their life, preferably near the end. You can not slaughter or shear sheep without a knife in your home. Remember that if this is a second field, your yields will be lower (approximately 3/4 of a full yield). It is recomended that you hire one with decent intellegence, to get a reasonable amount of woolProposed sheep cycles  Proposed sheep cycle one Day 0: buy all sheep Day 3: shear (get 6 balls of wool) Day 6: shear (get 6 balls of wool) Day 9: shear (get 6 balls of wool) Day 11: slaughter one sheep Day 12: shear (get 3-4 balls of wool) Day 13: slaughter a surviving sheep (if there are any left. (an average of 3 hides)) (Sheep start dying on day 8 on average, so with this cycle, you may not get many hides) Proposed sheep cycle two Day 0: buy two sheep Day 1: buy two more sheep Day 2: shear (get 3 balls of wool) Day 3: just feed Day 4: just feed Day 5: shear (get 6 balls of wool) Day 6: just feed Day 7: just feed Day 8: shear (get 6 balls of wool) Day 9: slaughter one sheep (get 1-3 hides) Day 10: slaughter a sheep (get 1-3 hides) Day 11: shear (get 4 balls of wool) Day 12: slaughter any surviving sheep (if there are any left)Average Yields (1st fields)  Wool Yields for a sheep ranch where all the sheep are bought on day zero and slaughter on consecutive days.Blacksmith  Blacksmith is a profession Level 2 and above. Blacksmiths take iron ore and wood and convert them to usable items such as knives, swords, axes, buckets,and steel. Blacksmiths can also sharpen axes that are dulled in forest towns.Blacksmith's Guide Items Ranching Pigs Guide 1 Description  The Breeding of Pigs guide is a post in the Renaissance Kingdoms Forums. It explains how pig ranches operate and gives players advice on efficient pig farming techniques.Fundamentals  A player can have up to four pigs in one ranch, and there are two options for feeding your pigs. Pigs are fed as a group and can be either feed grass (for free), or corn, which you must buy from the market and place in your home inventory. Each pig eats one bag of corn per day. If the pigs are fed grass, they grow at an average rate of 5/18 half-hundredweights (HHWs) per day, if fed with corn they grow at an average rate of 5/9 HHWs per day. A pig has the following sizes and associated outputs of HHW: First Field: Second Field: When a pig is intended to be slaughtered (regardless if it's hired or player labor) a knife will need to be in the player/rancher's home inventory. Knives have a 25% risk of breaking every time they\u2019re used. If you have two pigs to be slaughtered on the same day (in different fields) you now have to have two knives to use them. Akin to vegetable harvesting, there is no benefit to hiring skilled (stat) labor in slaughtering pigs. So, you will select intelligence of \"0\" and place the pay wage for your worker and click the \"hire\" button.Advice and Accepted Strategies  Common strategies require about \u00a3120 to start with, not counting the cost of the field itself, nor the price of cultivating the field if it was not a pig farm to begin with. This \u00a3120 will mostly be used to buy pigs (3 pigs @ \u00a325 each, you start out getting 1 pig for free), and some initial feed corn. Raising pigs is a medium risk venture and it requires that a player be active daily in that the player's pigs require daily feeding. Additionally, there is a risk that a player's pigs may die even if fed properly. The risk is very low, but present nevertheless. It is highly recommended that you always feed your pigs corn. A possible exception is if your pig ranch is a secondary field and the price of corn is high and the price of HHWs is low. Note that since there is no benefit in having higher strength when slaughtering a pig, so you should only hire unstated workers at minimum wage. Schedule One: Schedule Two (Flex): Math on the expected profits. Note that most cycles will be somewhat far from the average, but it will even out given time. Assumptions: Income: HHWs: (4 pigs * 5/9 HHWs/pig/day * 10 days + 4 * 1 HHWs) * (1 \u2013 0,02) = 25.7 HHWs over an 11 day cyclus (Note that once the program is running, day 11 = day 0). The starting size of a pig also gives a HHW The chance that the pig will die before slaughtering it is 2% or 0.02 25.7 HHW * \u00a315.50/HHW = \u00a3398.35 Expenses: Buying 4 pigs: 4 pigs * \u00a325/pig = \u00a3100 Corn: 10 days * 1 bag/day/pig * 4 pigs = 40 bags 40 bags * \u00a33.40/bag = \u00a3136 Labour: 4 slaughterings * \u00a316,80/slaughtering = \u00a367.20 Knives: 4 slaughterings * \u00bc knife/slaughtering * \u00a316.60/knife = \u00a316.60 Total expenses: \u00a3100 + \u00a3136 + \u00a367.20 + \u00a316.60 = \u00a3319.80 Net profit: \u00a3398.35 - \u00a3319.80 = 78.55 Net daily profit: \u00a378.55 / 11 days = 7.14\u00a3/day Reputation Points: You get 4 reputation points every 11 days or 0.36 RP/day For those who wish to toggle the numbers a bit, here are the death probabilities for pigs: The first percentage is the probability of the pig dying on the given day. The cumulative percentage is the probability of the pig dying on this day or before that.Nox Noctis Gentis Obscurum  Nox Noctis Gentis Obscurum, or better known by their acronym, NNGO, is one of the oldest and most widely known organizations in all of the Renaissance Kingdoms and is a subject to much debate. Under their famous leader, Anto Capone, NNGO has moved to, and operated in, five countries (France, England, Scotland, and most recently Aragon and Castile), and have taken up residence in Ireland. Since then the majority of members can now be found in Scotland. Some see them as a heroic group simply trying to destroy a \"corrupted system,\" and some see them as villains.Battle of Port L\u00e1irge  Anto Capone raised an army of NNGO and (after a bug that had been discovered by the previous mayor was leaked out to the public) installed himself as mayor of the town. The following day, the army was declared rogue by Munster Council. In response to this, NNGO made Port L\u00e1irge independent from Munster. This began a month long stand off, where eventually the Munster armies claimed back the town, after a full five days of battle. At the time, Port L\u00e1irge held the record as the longest independent town in all of the Renaissance Kingdoms (a record later broken in Leinster following the Irish Civil War). This incident also caused Port L\u00e1irge to receive the \"new\" fish types and is the only town in English speaking RK to have them.NNGO and the Free City of Cill Chaoi  On September 24th 1457 a NNGO army named \"Obscene Outlaw Party Squad\", or Oops for short, commanded by General Donnor Tudor arrived at the gates of Cill Chaoi. After a lengthy discussion the mayor had decided to allow the army to enter the town to minimize casualties and soon after the army was in town, Donnor Tudor took over the Town Hall. The following evening Donnor Tudor gave up his chair to Anto_Capone and then went and claimed the town independent of An Mumhain. Members of the NNGO are now claiming Cill Chaoi as a free city and have been rumored to be moving there in large numbers to finally be free from the oppressive council of An Mumhain. (November 9th, 1457)\u00a0Free City\u00a0is the first city in Ireland, and all of the English speaking realms to complete a port (first port). In addition, the first ship, \"Chalice\", was sold to Lord Arogandor (4,000p) and his first mate Lector of the \"Grail Lords Shipping Company\". Bound for England and\u00a0charging 300p a ticket the ship left the docks of Free City on November 20th, 1457 carrying cargo and notable passengers such as Dolina, Lady_Brianna, Maximiliaan, Nosferattus,\u00a0and Jaseph. On December 8th their ship arrived safely in Liverpool, England.NNGO and the The Great An Mumhain Purge  (December, 1457) The NNGO seizes An Mumhain council and in a few weeks, and as part of their plan, completely destroyed the country. At this time the NNGO\u2019s control extended everywhere in An Mumhain, from all of its council positions to its military force. With the council ruled by the group, arrests were sent out to over a dozen individuals suspected of being part of a rebel alliance. Many of these individuals were executed as enemies of the country, but some few, fortunate individuals received long sentences of jail time and crippling fines. It was also during this time that the country of An Mumhain (Munster, Ireland) effectively ceased to exist. Its mines completely crumbling, massive amounts of debt, internal divided chaos, and no goods or animals turned not only the capital of Corcaigh into a semi ruined city, but also the entire country. None of the its towns split off from each other, or came under the control of any warlords. Leaving the county hurting, many of the NNGO sailed out of Ireland at this time for greener pastures.NNGO Seafaring Operations  NNGO were the first in all of the RK English-speaking realms to build and complete a port, in Cill Chaoi, Ireland. The Chalice was the first ship ever constructed in RK by the NNGO, under supervision of Captain Anto Capone in Cill Chaoi, Ireland. The NNGO were also the first ever to to build a fleet of five ships that include: Booty, Nomad, Don't Panic, Goodship Lollipop, and Cutty Sark. Currently, the NNGO fleet consists of many ships, and continues to grow. In December of 1458 the NNGO fleet attacked and sank 3 English navy ships. Current operations are classified, but NNGO operations continue to expand. Maiden Voyages of the NNGO Fleet: (January 11th, 1458) The first ship (\u201cBooty\u201c) in the NNGO fleet leaves its home port of Cill Chaoi, Ireland, bound for Scotland. The passengers on this momentous trip include Anto_Capone (Captain), Dee_Snider (Crew), Dizmalus (Crew), Kriegwafen, Plutogirl, Thickcrab (deceased), and Zakku. Arrived Ardencaple, Scotland January 26th, 1458. (January 17th, 1458) The second ship (\"Nomad\") of the fleet leaves Ireland. Passengers included Zeakman (Captain), Antigoon (Crew), Ashley, Balutz, Devin, Lord_senschal, Oydelia (Crew), and Shaitan. Arrived Ardencaple, Scotland January 29th, 1458. (January 18th, 1458) The third ship (\"Don't Panic\") of the fleet leaves Ireland. Passengers included Mick_ (Captain), Connodor, Jaqk (Crew), Kevin.kane, Maddie20, Mani3, and Pirokiller (Crew). Arrived Largs, Scotland February 1, 1458. Headed to Ardencaple, Scotland for ship repairs, arriving on February 16, 1458. (February 21st, 1458) The fourth ship (\u201cGoodship Lollipop\u201c) of the fleet leaves Ireland. Passengers included Roxxane (Captain), Biggumbo, Reddmaeve, Samanthastone, Stiffy, Toastini (Crew), and Yaznaki. Arrived Ardencaple, Scotland March 6th, 1458. (March 25th, 1458) The fifth ship (\u201cCutty Sark\u201c) of the fleet leaves Ireland. Passengers included Fhead (Captain), Alexandrelejuste (Crew), Seanan, Selyna, Sirbenve, Theworm13, and Viery (Crew). Arrived Ardencaple, Scotland March 31st, 1458.NNGO Invasion of England  The NNGO invaded England in the Summer of 1458. A return to England had been long planned by the NNGO who wanted to avenge their betrayal by England long since past. After almost a week of intense fighting, the four NNGO and Fury Armies were able to dislodge the defending English Armies. Carlisle and the County of Cumberland was now under NNGO control. English Armies moved to the outskirts of Carlisle and with neither side having a sizable tactical superiority, a period of siege began with the occasional battle to test each other's resolve. At this time the English city of Carlisle was annexed to Galloway, Scotland by the NNGO. England began to gather additional forces in order to re-take Carlisle, but would not attempt to take back the County. After holding control of the County for over a month, and with mounting pressure from the King (the game administration), the NNGO decided to tactically withdraw from Carlisle. 90% of the NNGO forces made their escape by ship, while some simply crossed the border back into Scotland. The initial invasion was concluded, but hostilities continue between the NNGO and England.NNGO Returns to Ireland  While the NNGO were engaged in combat activities in England, the King decided to close down the headquarters of NNGO in Cill Chaoi, Ireland. This left the large majority of NNGO homeless, and helped to force the NNGO withdrawal from Carlisle. Scattered across Ireland, the NNGO decided that their new base of operations will be within the County of Chonnacht in Ireland. This large scale process of relocating dozens of people took a considerable amount of time and resources, and set back the military operations of NNGO by months. After many months of rebuilding, the NNGO successfully won 3 consecutive Council terms in Chonnacht. NNGO's accomplishments during this time period included the completion of a level 4 port, smoothly managing the unexpected return of mine maintenance, and economic leadership and stability for Chonnacht. Satisfaction polls were at an all-time high during NNGO's tenure on Council. The NNGO continues to expand its scope of operations in Chonnacht and beyond, while organizing future operations. Now, something unexpected had stirred the pot and the future planned operations will soon come to fruition. The NNGO will be on the march as the rallying cry is taken up all over Ireland and beyond.Cow  Cow are a type of field, specifically a ranch. Up to four cows are available for each ranch. Each cow costs 45 pounds to purchase from the sheriff. When nourished every day, cows will maintain weight or improve it. Cows can be milked every three days and slaughtered at any time for their meat.Cow Facts and Costs Sheet  1) Breeding: Some counties do not breed cows. Check with your Town Hall to see if your county has cows. 2) Costs: Cow ranching can be costly. I do not suggest it as a first or even second field. a. Here are items you'll need. (These are worst-case costs because buckets don't break with every single use and knives break 1/3 uses):\n Cows ________ 4 X 45\n Buckets ______ 4 X 40-46 pounds\n Knives _______ 4 X 15-16 pounds\n Milkers_______ 4 X 19-25 pounds (Milkers should have 20+ intelligence)\n Slaughterers__ 4 X 16-19\nSuggested Investment Capital = 540 pounds. c. Make sure you get milkings or slaughters when you should or you could lose capital or an animal.\n\n d. Consider investing in your buckets and knives before purchasing your animals. 3) Selling: \n\n a. Milk will sell cheaper in fishing towns (both milk and fish give intelligence).\n\n b. HW(hundredweight) prices should coordinate with HHW(half-hundredweight) prices. An HW is about double an HHW.Proposed Cow Cycle One  (This schedule is based on the Breeding of Cows guide in the Renaissance Kingdoms Forums.) 1.day => Purchase of 4 cows for 180-200 pounds \n 2.day => \n 3.day => \n 4.day => hire a worker to milk your cows for 19-25 pounds \n 5.day => (+8 bottles of milk) \n 6.day => \n 7.day => hire a worker to milk your cows for 19-25 pounds \n 8.day => (+8 bottles of milk) \n 9.day => \n 10.day => hire a worker to milk your cows for 19-25 pounds \n 11.day => (+8 bottles of milk) \n 12.day => \n 13.day => hire a worker to milk your cows for 19-25 pounds \n 14.day => hire a worker to slaughter a cow for 16-18 pounds (+8 bottles of milk) \n 15.day => hire a worker to slaughter a cow for 16-18 pounds (+3 hw) \n 16.day => hire a worker to slaughter a cow for 16-18 pounds (+3 hw) \n 17.day => hire a worker to slaughter a cow for 16-18 pounds (+3 hw) \n 18.day => Purchase of 4 cows (+3 hw) You get about: \n => 8*4=32 bottles of milk \n => 3*4=12 hw (Your HW will vary greatly. Some cows will be skinny when slaughtered. Most will never get as fat as normal.)Proposed Cow Cycle Two  (Created by Grace Garland de Grey) 0 Buy two cows & feed all 1 Buy one cow & feed all 2 Buy one cow & feed all 3 Milk & feed all 4 Feed All 5 Feed All 6 Milk & feed all 7 Feed All 8 Feed All 9 Milk & feed all 10 Kill cow 1 (or fattest cow) & feed all 11 Kill cow 2 (or fattest cow) & feed all 12 Milk & feed all 13 Kill fattest cow - Buy two cows & feed all 14 Kill fattest cow - Buy cow & feed all 15 Milk - Buy cow & feed all Etc.Proposed Cow Cycle Three  (Created by Roy_Garlock):HW Yields Based on Size: Variables Level 6  Level 6 is one of the levels of the new level system in Renaissance Kingdoms.Requirements  The Count's First Secretary says: By Jah! Aren't you ashamed? Please get dressed first! (assuming you don't fulfil the clothing requirements)Clothing  Treena tells us in the FAQ area of the forum: \"To reach level 6 you must be wearing shoes, trousers, shirt, belt, hose, and hat. Boots and poulaines count as shoes. Toques and headscarves count for hats for men.\". Corroborated from the In Game (IG) FAQ section Levelling Up.Different methods  There are two methods for achieving Level 6:Method 1 Method 2 Advice  While Method 2 is potentially faster (it requires less money), the amount of money which will be necessary for your studies as you pursue your way will be extremely large and it's generally a good idea to have plenty of money on hand.To attain  When you go to see the Count's First Secretary he will take 1000 pounds from you. You will need the remainder of your money to pursue your studies.Advancement  Level 7 is attainable for all way except science through gaining points through working in your way. Level 7 is reached through a not fully known mechanism which let the scholars with the most points advance a level.Kingdom of Ireland  The Kingdom of Ireland (Ireland or \u00c9ire) is one of the three English-speaking nations of Renaissance Kingdoms, the others being the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland. Its counties are An Mumhain, Laighean, and C\u00faige Chonnacht. It also posesses several independent towns;\u00a0Port L\u00e0irge,\u00a0Lios Mor\u00a0and\u00a0Imleach, the latter two of which were made independent following a war between the\u00a0Celtic Alliance\u00a0and\u00a0An Mumhain.

To get the needed reputation points, you can work at the church more, but it is generally much faster and suggested that you meet people around your town by joining in conversations in the taverns or in the Town Hall forums. To reach level 3, a character must fulfill various requirements which include:Profession  Professions are available to players Level 2 and above. Each profession gives a player a different workshop at their home. A player is given the choice for profession when Level 2 is reached. To build a new workshop costs 500 pounds. There are 6 professions:Food  Food is your avatar's daily sustenance. At a lower level you need to consume two hunger points per day to survive, and this increases to three a day at level 6. All food and stat food offer either 1 or 2 hunger points. Stat food also gives bonuses to your avatar's stats depending on the type. Food can be purchased at a Town Market, County Fair or in a tavern.Food benefit chart  This chart outlines the benefits of each type of food.Eating Strategies  Over time, there have been two strategies for eating which vary from the standard of eating 2 HP per day. They are known as alternating and turbo statting. Q - What about Food? What's the difference between Health and Hunger? Eating may seem a bit odd in RK, but isn't really. There are 2 measures: (When you see the \"Home\" page, you see your Health and Hunger in the upper right corner.) Food is measured in HP (Hunger Points*), and the \"stats\" that they improve (Int, Str, or Cha). Corn and bread are cheaper, but improve no stats. (* sometimes seen as \"PH\", which is a French-ish mistranslation: \"Points of Hunger\") And, no, there is no difference between a vegetable and a fruit, except where they come from, fields for vegetables and Orchards in Orchard towns for fruit. Nor is there a difference between Fish and Milk accept you have to drink two milk or eat 2 cheese to get the same Stat points. Each day you need to eat (at least) 2 HP (Hunger Points), and this will keep you at \"Fit\", the highest health level. If you do not eat 2 HP, you drop to the next Health level down and will probably lose some stats - usually -1 in each - try never to do this! (Go in to \"Retreat\", in the Church, if you are going on vacation!). If you do drop from \"Fit\", the next highest health level is \"Exhausted\", then \"Weak\" - and it gets worse from there, until you die. (You can resurrect but there is a limited time for this). (Note that you can eat 1 HP and then be \"still hungry\", and then eat something else. If you eat 1 HP and then 2 HP (1+2), you get the full stat increase from both foods, but are no more \"full\" than if you ate just the 2 (1+1).) Q - How do you increase your Stats? \"Stat food\" is much more expensive than corn or bread, so do not eat stat food before making 1st level! There is no need - when you are Level 0, your only goal is to save the money (90 pds) you need to get that field! Wink And plan ahead - you need only 20 in each stat for 2nd Level, no need to rush there either. Now, if you want to get tricky, you can save some money... If you have no stats (0 level, new character), you can just starve. Nothing to brag about, but no stats to lose - nothing to lose but your pride. Try not to starve \"to death\", and don't eat stat food until you eat enough bread to become at least \"exhausted\" - then it's safe to eat stat foods and not lose what you just worked to build up. If you have any stats, you do not want to lose them, and you lose them if you starve - usually... that's where the trick comes in. If you are at Fit and eat only 1 Health Point of Food (1 corn, 1 milk, or 1 fruit/vegie), you drop to the next lower level, Exhausted, but do not lose any stats! This only happens if you were Fit, and you still must have eaten 1 HP of food. Then, if you eat 2 HP the next day, you return to Fit, and lose no points. So, so long as you start at \"Fit\", you can eat 1 pt, then 2 pts, then 1 pt, then 2 pts, alternately and forever, with no harm. (But if you mess up, even once, you will lose stats!). With Bread/Corn/Bread/Corn, this can save you about 3 pds every 2 days - about 10 pds a week. With stat foods, this can save you more, but your stat increases will be a bit slower - it all depends on what you can afford. If you ever fail to eat enough twice in a row, you drop to Weak. Then you lose stats no matter what, and you lose more as you try to climb your way back up, even if you do eat enough. Losing this many stats is expensive to replace (unless you have no stats to lose, like a Level 0 - see \"starvation\" options for Level 0, above). Be Aware - if you are below Exhausted, you will lose stats as you recover your health levels, even if you eat a full 2 HP per day! Q - What stats are important? A high Str (from eating meat) allows you to get the more common better jobs that have stat requirements. With a high Int (from eating fish or milk), you can work the other high stat jobs that are seen, and have more \"picks\" on the resource maps (fish, wood, fruit). A high Charisma will help you win competition for jobs, and steal items on the market from other simultaneous bidders. Once you have 20 in each stat, that is enough for 2nd level. 50+ Strength (or more - 101, 151, etc.) improves your Fighting ability, (which is desirable if you are in the Army, or a bandit, or fighting a bandit.) For Level 3, you will need at least 60 in 2 stats, and 120 in one more - see Level 3 guide for specifics. There are endless RK legends and rumours about other bonuses - few have been proven, but the game-code changes, so you just never know.Field  Fields are player-owned property used in the production of goods. There are six types of fields, divided into two categories:Crop fields (also known as Farms) Ranches  Players gets a field when they advance to level 3. Only level 3+ can buy fields. Players can sell their fields on the land market in the town hall.England's Best New Player's Guide!  England's Best New Player's [sic] Guide! is an ongoing project in the Wiltshire Inn for the benefit of new Wiltshire players, started and mainly written by the Winchester NeWT (Newbie Welcoming Team). The project has expanded to involve the whole county of Wiltshire. They \"are offering the most current, most correct and most readable guide to life in RK.\" Some of it is specific to Winchester, but most of it is useful for anyone. Its creation is ongoing below.Level 0 Onwards: Guide to Your First 2 Weeks in RK  Adapted from the Winchester Welcome Letter You can, of course, go your own way. But if you want a quick-and-easy progression to the next level, follow the advice here! At the end of 2 weeks, you\u2019ll have reached Level 1 (Hooray!), and you\u2019ll have begun to make the friendships and connections that are really the heart of Renaissance Kingdoms.The Road Ahead  You start with 2 bread, 50 pounds(\u00a3), and 0 Reputation Points, and are alive! Huzzah! To get to level 1 in 14 Days: You have to eat, work, and not die! To get to Level 1: You have to save up a minimum of \u00a390 (English currency) \u2013 though \u00a3120 would be better - and you have to earn 5 Reputation Points (which may include up to 3 Trust Points \u2013 TP). Also, you have to live!Stayin' Alive  How to stay alive: Eat either 1 bread or 2 corn EACH DAY. There are other foods, but right now they don\u2019t do you any good, and would be a waste of your valuable money. Once you eat your two breads, buy either 2 corn per day or 1 bread \u2013 whichever is cheaper. You can also eat corn/bread in the Taverns, IF it\u2019s cheaper than in the market. Shop around!Money  To save up the money you need: DON\u2019T BUY ANYTHING BUT CORN or BREAD! I know it\u2019s tempting \u2013 but you don\u2019t need anything else until you level up! I promise!To Earn More Money  Work 2 days in the Church (Town => Church => Work at the Church), and all other days at the Mine. You get \u00a35 / day at the Church \u2013 but you also get an RP every day you do! Work all other days in the Mines. There are other jobs, but this is the best job for Lvl 0 and new Lvl 1. You get about \u00a316 every day \u2013 half paid the day you work, half paid on Sundays.It's a Matter of Trust  To get your 3 other TP: Ask for them! Either in the taverns (Town => Tavern) , or in the forum.

Click on Duchy (left side of screen), then Good job! 90 of your hard-earned pounds will be taken, and you will now have a field!A Few Laws Every Person in Wiltshire Should Know!  (Adapted... nay, stolen outright, from Lady Maladicta Carlyon Dragons) Here in Wiltshire we have laws that govern the maximum prices of certain goods that are sold on the market. I feel that if you are aware of this then you won't be taken advantage of by the occasional unscrupulous trader we get. Maximum price: 8,00 pounds Maximum price: 4 pounds Maximum price: 14 pounds Maximum price: 16 pounds Maximum price: 5 pounds There is also a law that regulates slavery, ie minimum wage. This is currently \u00a315. If you should see someone selling goods for higher than is allowed, or trying to hire for less than \u00a315, please contact either myself or the mayor.Spreadsheet: Working and Eating Your Way to Level 1  For those of you who are number-nerds, here's a spreadsheet proving that you can get to Level 1 in 2 weeks. You can get there in 12 days if you change up your eating, alternative a day with 1 bread and a day with 1 corn (that's the Speed Version).Your Stats and How to Increase Them  (With thanks to Hari_Seldon and an anonymous author) You may have noticed as you poke around the game that you have three categories of statistics: Strength, Intelligence, and Charisma.Strength  Strength helps you with your jobs (fields, orchard, forest, fishing). It also gives you an edge in battle (if you're ever in one). Lastly, you need it to be at 20 so you can go to Level 2.Intelligence  Intelligence makes you a more efficient worker in the orchard, forest, and fishing because you can get more \"tries\" - so you're more likely to get a bigger harvest/catch. It's also necessary for some field jobs. You also need this at 20 before you can go to Level 2, and you'll use Intelligence even more in Level 3, if you pursue the Church or Science.Charisma  Charisma affects your ability to buy and sell on the market. When there are several offers or bids of the same good/job offer at the same price/wage, the person with the highest charisma wins. Should you get into the army, you need Charisma to organize an army. It also affects rebellions: The person with the highest charisma becomes Mayor/Dictator in a succesful rebellion. (But don't rebel! We're law-abiding here in Wiltshire.) Finally, like the other ones, you need to get it to 20 so you can get to Level 2, and you'll use it in Level 3 if you go towards the Army/State.Increasing Your Stats  Eventually, you want to build up your Strength and Intelligence to at least 19, so you can start taking the higher-paying jobs and get the best yield from the orchard/forest/fishing. (Also, you need all stats at 20 or more to get to Level 2\u2026 but that\u2019s a while away). To do this, just eat different foods! Every day, you need to eat to fill your two hunger points (HP) Over time, with a balanced diet, you\u2019ll reach your goals! Eat healthy!Having Fun in RK: Or, How to Get Into Role-Playing  By Oariana, Editing by Nivera To successfully role play is easy. What you say? Easy? Honestly it is. All you have to remember are 2 things, (1) Everyone was you once; unsure, new and confused. (2) Everyone is willing to accept a new role player; in fact they are eager for it. If not for new people, role playing would grow stale. This Guide is not about How to RP, but How To Get To the RP in the Forums For starters, there are 2 forums that can be accessed through the In Game screen:Forum No 1: Main Forum  Main Game Screen => Forums => Go to the forum with your player's account \u201cyour characters name\u201d Town Hall You will see a screen filled with categories; initially you should go right down to the bottom where you will find your County Inn and underneath that in a subcategory will be your Town Hall. It is best to get to know your town first and join in there, and then when you get more confident or more in the know, go and participate in your Inn. Interactions with other people and getting involved with your town will direct you to the other places in the forums so don\u2019t worry, take your time, sit back and get comfortable. In your town, the first places to visit are: Introduce Yourself Here Click on link, read others posts to get an idea of what you might say and then on the left hand side of the screen click on Post Reply. That will take you to a screen where you write your post. Once written, click Preview and check out your post. If you don\u2019t need to edit anything, click Submit. There is also an Introduce Yourself thread in your local Inn, go there too! After you have braved the big bad world of Introductions, let\u2019s go check out the rest of your Town forum. Usually there is a Tavern thread that is easy to go and join in with, do that for sure. For other threads, my best advice is if you read something, and you have a response to it, post it! Go ahead, we can\u2019t hear you if you say it to your computer screen. (The exception to this would be people\u2019s House threads. Reading them is your choice, but ask before posting to someone\u2019s personal space.) County Inn Okay, going to the County Inn is similar. If you have a response, post it! If you have a question about something someone says in there, trust me there will be queues of people waiting to share what they learned by asking in the same way. Taverns Don\u2019t forget to sit and spend time with people in the Taverns In Game also. Getting to know people there will give you more ideas and confidence to RP. It can also help you develop your character after you have some conversations in your \u201cnew\u201d voice. Special Note There are players here for whom English is their second language, others with spelling and grammar difficulties. None of that matters. Don\u2019t let anything stop you from becoming one of us!Forum No 2: Second or French Forum  Main Game Screen => Forums => Acc\u00e9der au forum secondaire avec mon compte joueur \u201cYour characters name.\u201d Hitchhikers Guide to the Kingdom At the top is the General Forum. This will take you to the Hitchhikers Guide to the Kingdom. Here you will find \u201cHow To\u201d guides for everything that your character can do in the game. Check it out, it is the official area for game help tips. Counties and Guilds Also in this section are the different Counties that are in our Kingdom. This includes our local County Council where other players can actually (with your input) run our County. Your local County Inn (in the other forum) is closely connected with this. In fact the Inn is the politicians\u2019 RP playground as well as ours. You don\u2019t have to be a politician to be interested in what is happening to our County. There are also guilds and groups that are waiting for a new voice to join them. Check out a few groups and join. If you discover one is not for you, try another. Private Groups If you find that you can not access some places, that usually means that you have not been accepted as a member. To become a member all you have to do is click on the moderator\u2019s name and send them a Private Message. They will either give you access or tell you how to gain access.How to get an Avatar and Banner  (found in the second forum) So, you\u2019ve seen those snazzy pictures by everyone\u2019s posts (avatars) and their beautiful signature blocks (banners). And of course, you want one, too. Check out the first page, because the first post will usually tell you how to post your request. Read other\u2019s requests then post your own. (Usually what you want written on your banner, your name, town, quote. And tell them a bit about your character [a little kindly old lady that loves children and bakes cookies?]Some Final Advice  Hopefully this will give you a basic handle on the 2 sides of the Forum. And now that you\u2019ve looked around, don\u2019t be afraid to join in and Role Play with your Neighbors, soon to be Friends! WHAT YOU NEED TO REMEMBER IS THIS: Role Play or grow bored, and we can\u2019t have that! A new player that joins in with the Role Play side of this game is appreciated by everyone. Also, don\u2019t forget that once you are in this game for more than a month it becomes your responsibility to encourage new players, and even old ones, to come along and RP as well. We always need to encourage others, so we can all have fun!Level 1 Onwards: Field and Ranch Overview  By Graciebells, of Dorchester At level 1, each person can have two fields. Your first field is given to you when you level up. The second can (and should) be purchased before moving to level 2, when you save up enough. These fields can be almost any combination of the different field types. Each field type requires a different number of days to complete each cycle, and varying amounts of work. The only combination that is not possible to obtain by easy means is the combination of pigs and corn.The Crop Fields  Crop fields are the most recommended type of fields for those just leveling. They take considerably less money to start and maintain, along with less work per cycle. These fields consist of: Here is the link for Vegetable fields Here is the link for Corn fields Here is the link for Wheat fieldsAnimal Ranches  Animal ranches are best for those with extra income and those who don't mind extra work. These fields generally are not recommended for those who have just leveled up. Each type of ranch has a risk of the animals not gaining in size (which decreases the yield produced) or dying, and a risk of tools (knives/buckets) breaking. The animals come directly from the Wiltshire sheriff, so if the county does not get enough corn and wheat, there can also be animal shortages or delays in getting available animals. These types of fields consist of: Here is a link to breeding pigs (Under Construction) Here is a link to breeding sheep (Under Construction) Here is a link to raising cowsCrop Yield Charts  If you're a numbers kind of person, these charts are for you! They summarize the cycles, investments and yields of your fields - at a glance!How to Grow Wheat Like a Professional!  By Extli, Lazy and Nivera This is the highest maintenance Field choice. Wheat fields have a 10 day Cycle. Plow the Field \u2013 This is Hired or Worked by yourself. A Strength of 19 will work to maximize field condition and increase harvest. Sow the field. \u2013 This is Hired or Worked by yourself. An Intelligence of 19 will work to maximize field condition and increase harvest. You must have a Bag of Wheat in your Home's property inventory: Buy a bag of Wheat, then go to My Home => Your Inventory => Leave at Home (next to the Wheat) or hold one bag aside from each harvest. The wheat grows and no maintenance is needed. You Harvest, either by Hiring someone to Pick the ready Wheat or Work it yourself. A Strength of 19 will work to maximize the harvest.Working Your Field  To access your wheat field, select My Home => Your Home => click the picture of the field on the right side of the screen.

It cannot be eaten directly by a player. Wheat is also used to make animals by the County Sheriff.Special note  For those who own 2 Fields of Wheat: If you have either 2 Corn or 2 Wheat Fields, you can use 1 Bag to sow both fields if they are done the same day.How to Grow Corn for Fun and Profit  By Lazy, Extli and Nivera Corn is an average maintenance field choice. In U.S. parlance, corn mean a specific grain (maize or Indian corn) but in British English, corn means the common grain of a region. Here it is more like Oats. Corn fields have a 7 day Cycle. It starts on day 1, Sow the Field \u2013 This is Hired or Worked by yourself. A Strength of 19 will work to maximize field condition and increase harvest.

Corn is used to Make animals By the County Sheriff. Corn is also used to increase Pig growth by those who raise them.Special Note on Buying a Second Field  A Special note for those who own 2 Fields of Corn: If you have either 2 Corn or 2 Wheat Fields, you can use 1 Bag to sow both fields if they are done the same day. It is possible to have Both a Corn and Pig farm, but it is only possible to get it with a lot of planning, work and a little luck as the Programming in game prevents you from changing your field to Pigs if you have Corn, or Corn if you have Pigs.Your Vegetables and You!  By Jewbeard and... Lazy? Nymphaea, Technical Consultant The least maintenance Field choice is Vegetables.Growing Cycle  Vegetable fields have a 5 day Cycle. No work required on Day 1. (You do not need to sow or plant anything) From day 2 through 5, the veggies grow and no maintenance is needed. On Day 5, you Hire someone to Pick the Ripe Vegetables or work it yourself. Because the Harvest quantity is not changed by high stats, Paying 15 to 17p is typical for a Hire wage.Working Your Field  To access your veggie patch, select My Home => Your Home => click the picture of the field on the right side of the screen. Here you find a \"Hire/Work\" box in the center of the screen. Please note, that the hiring wage defaults to \u00a312, which is an illegal wage. You must hire for \u00a315 or above.The Yield of a Veggie Patch  You will always get 4 Vegetables from your primary (first) field. Your second field will always give you 3 Vegetables.Selling Your Product  When you are ready to sell your Harvest, check the prevailing price in the Town Market first, then decide on your price and put up for sale. My Home => Your Inventory => Put on Sale next to the item. Selling Veggies from \u00a39.5 to 11 is very typical in most areas. In Wiltshire, the average is closer to \u00a310.5 This will change a little depending on If you live in a Fruit town, where there is competition with Vegetables. Veggies can be eaten by players as food. You must eat 2 veggies to fill your 2 daily hunger points. It also increases your Charisma stat by 1 for each veggie (which corn & wheat do not do!)Getting Fruity in The Orchard  (Credited to Baiboe, Urshak; Edited by Jewbeard) Some towns, such as Winchester, have an Orchard in them (Town => Orchard). The Orchard is where we pick fruit (remember, they give 1 Hunger Point and 1 Charisma Point). How many fruits you get per day depends on the yield of the spot in the orchard you settle on during any particular day. You get 1 fruit for every\u00a0%100 of a fruit you pick - and it carries over from day to day, so it is possible to pick 2 (or even 3) fruits a day. When you click the Orchard, this is what you see: With a Large Ladder in your hand, strength in your arms and intelligence in your head, the Orchard is an excellent way to make a day's wages! Here is a quick guide to show you how this works:Intelligence  You can move from tree to tree to find the best yield for picking. You need Intelligence to do this. The higher your Intelligence is, the more moves you get to find the best spots.Strength  You need Strength to reach the better positions on the trees, which are shown by colored spots on each tree. You can see the way Strength helps by looking at this table: Strength alone is not enough, however.Ladders  To pick the Blue or Red fruits, you need at least 10 strength (see the table above), and you need at least a Small Ladder. (These should cost around \u00a325) To pick the Green or Yellow fruits, you need at least 15-20 Strength, and a Large Ladder (usually around \u00a375 on the market). The sooner you gain 20 Strength and at least 5 Intelligence and acquire a Large Ladder, the better you will profit from picking fruits. People do earn good with a minimum of 5 Intelligence and 10 Strength with a Small Ladder.The Orchard Map  Some Orchard towns, like Winchester, make use of an online map of the orchard, where you can enter the yields of the fruit you find, and mark down which ones you (or others) have taken. This effectively increases your intelligence - it's a good idea!Selling Your Fruit  If you decide not to eat your fruit, you can sell it! Fruit goes into your inventory after the day on which you pick it. To find it, go to \"My Home =>Your Inventory,\" click \"Put on Sale\" next to the fruit. Check prevailing market prices, but fruit will typically sell anywhere between \u00a310.25p and 11. If you want to be a dear, you can put it up for \u00a310 - you make a little bit less money, but your town will thank you! Happy picking!!!Beginners Cow Guide  By Douwecarel, some editing by Jewbeard In Short: Cow-herds provide a valuable community service (a source of Meat for strength and Milk for intelligence), but are financially risky and not very profitable.Cow herding, what does it mean?  Cows are one of the only two intelligence-enhancing stat food (milk: +1 intelligence point, +1 hunger point per bottle). Cow fields provide many jobs (and thus a lot of trust points for you). Cows are also a good source of meat (the cows Hundredth Weight HW is turned into 2 pieces of meat by the butcher. Each meat provides: +2 strength, +2 hunger points per piece of meat). Cows are only second to wheat in producing food. This makes cow fields a primary source of wealth and food for any village. Villages with many cow fields will have stronger and smarter inhabitants then villages without many herders. Besides all this cows are good company and it is cool to have cows. Go Cows! However herding cows is a financially risky option and even if done VERY well and under IDEAL circumstances it is just NOT very profitable. Taking a cow field should only be done in the knowledge that you will not make as much money as with pigs or wheat or even vegetables but you will provide the community with a valuable service. It is important to know that the available cow herding guides especially the one in the university library are terribly outdated and paint an overly positive picture of the noble cow herding trade. Do not be disappointed, and read on\u2026.Short & Simple Guide: Starting a Cow Field  You should really: Failing to observe these will result in a financially loss-giving operation. Think about this before starting a cow field. You have in your (home) inventory:The Cycle  The circle of life for your cows consist of birth, giving milk, and finally being butchered. In the meantime they will eat and possibly grow fat. If you are especially unfortunate their time to die comes before they are ready to be slaughtered. The time from purchase to slaughter is called the cycle. This guide deals with the easiest and possibly most profitable cycle. It is also the easiest cycle to stop breeding cows as it has a natural end. I will explain the process in a few simple steps. Step1 (day 0) Be careful the \u201cconvert field\u201d option is not fool proof. You should only confirm the conversion once. Step2 (day 0) Step 3 (day 1) Step 4 (days 3, 6, 9 and 12) Step 5 (day 13, 14, 15, 16) Step 6 (day 17 or 0) as step 2 Good luck with your cows (you will need it!).Expected Yield of Cow Herding  Many different factors can affect how profitable your cow-herding venture is. This section explains what those factors are, and shows how they affect your profit.Risks of Cow Herding  For those of you who would like to know more about the upsides and downsides of herding cows I include a section on Risk and on expected gains. Cow herders are plagued by risk more then anyone else. Besides the normal uncertainties of price because of competition, and fluctuating supply and demand there are 10 special risks associated with herding animals in general or cows in particular. Some of these risks can be mitigated by planning. Others are just what they are and cannot be changed.Expected yield  One set of cows is expected to give: 28-32 bottles of milk @ \u00a311 = 308-352 3-8 HW of cow @ \u00a332 = \u00a396-256 Total: \u00a3404-608 Stable costs: 4 cows @ \u00a345 = \u00a3180 4 milking @ \u00a319 pounds= \u00a376 Total: \u00a3256 Variable costs: 3-4 Slaughtering @ \u00a317 = \u00a351-68 0-3 Buckets @ \u00a340 = \u00a30-120 0-3 Knives @ \u00a316 = \u00a30-48 Total: \u00a351-168 Total benefits: (From Worst-case to Best-Case Very Bad Cycle (2 premature deaths, cycle of 15 days): Cows+milkings: \u00a3256 2 slaughterings: \u00a334 3 Buckets: \u00a3120 2 Knives: \u00a332 Income: 28 milk: \u00a3308 3 HW: \u00a396 Total Result: \u00a338/15= \u00a32.50 per day. Very Good Cycle (0 premature deaths, cycle of 17 days): Cows+milkings: \u00a3256 4 slaughterings: \u00a368 1 Buckets: \u00a340 1 Knives: \u00a316 Income: 32 milk: \u00a3352 8 HW: \u00a3256 Total Result: \u00a3228/17= \u00a313.40 per day. Very Average Cycle (0,5 premature deaths, cycle of 16,5 days): Cows+milkings: \u00a3256 3,5 slaughterings: \u00a360 1,5 Buckets: \u00a360 1,5 Knives: \u00a324 Income: 30 milk: \u00a3330 5.5 HW: \u00a3176 Total Result: \u00a3106/16,5= \u00a36.40 per day. So there you have it! Cows are about as good as wheat but only on average and only if milk prices are \u00a311, which is considered high by some.Sensitivities on Pricing Milk  In fishing towns milk is likely to be un-sellable for over \u00a310, in fact 18 pounds is considered an adequate price for fish. This implies that cow herders should get \u00a39 for their milk. Even in non fishing towns you will have to fight against fish imports to keep you price at a consistent \u00a311. [Note from Jewbeard: In Winchester, a fish-importing town, fish prices usually stay between \u00a319 and \u00a320.] Selling your milk at \u00a39 can be done for some time but realize that in a bad cycle you will lose \u00a318 or \u00a31.20 a day. An average cycle will only bring in \u00a346 or \u00a32.80 a day, a wage much worse then even a struggling corn farmer. People without cows will keep trying to tell you that the best possible cycle is just average. However, data from many cow farmers (look at the meat producers guild in the Cow Database) tells us that is just not true. There is no cow farmer in RK that makes a long term average of \u00a311.50 per day while selling milk at \u00a310 per bottle. (Let alone the \u00a318 predicted by the university library guide)In Conclusion  So, if you want to become rich, forget cows! They are not worth it. Go for wheat if you like no risk, fair gains, go for vegetables if you want to speculate, little risk good gains, go for pigs if you like high risk, high return, go for sheep if you\u2026 erm, well\u2026 \"like\" sheep\u2026. Epilogue: The \u00a312.50 /bottle debate In my early days as a cow farmer I once made the point that it would be fair for a cow farmer to ask \u00a312.50 per bottle. This was met with an amount disbelief and ridicule. While I never said milk could or even should realistically be priced @ 12.50 per bottle, the findings from many cow herders now show that 12.50 pounds/bottle in a poor cycle still only brings in 5.30 pounds per day. Even an average cycle only brings in 9.15 per day. In my opinion it is still a fair figure to compensate for the terrible risks the cow herder faces everyday. A milk price of 12.50 would make cow herding a decently profitable venture that rewards the people that put in a lot of work. Since fish is usually priced @18-22 pounds and since fish is not going away 11 pounds is what is maximally attainable and even that only at low levels of competition between cow herders. Cow herders should take pride in providing such a valuable service to their community, to keep fish traders honest, to provide milk and jobs to their community.For reference (On single, first field) Probabilities Writers/Editors  In alphabetical order, the writers and editors are:Girvan  Girvan is a forest town in the County of Galloway, Scotland. It is connected by roads to the capital of Ayr County, Ayr and Wigtown, the capital of Galloway. Girvan was dubbed as Scotland's Nudist Colony by Draferen a while back. Girvan is the home of The Girvan Bletherer Scotland's first national newspaper which was created and ran by Alyswold as well as the home of the famous Fretty's Hot Buns which only a handful of people know the recipe. Before The Bletherer Girvan also had a weekly newspaper known as The Girvan Gazette which was written by Grackon. Note: Girvan was formerly a fishing village and located in the County of Ayr, ScotlandTown Resources  The sea near Girvan was originally renowned for its smart fishes. However after many years of fishing the town ran its fish supply to the ground so moved to its only other natural resource, the forest . Anyone can work in the forest and chop between 4 and 6 pieces of wood. The Town Hall supplies axe's to those are aren't wealthy enough to buy one for themselves - just remember to be careful; they are extremely sharp! The wood is used in multiple things from being used to light the baker's stoves to repairing ships. Although the sea maybe depleted of fish any can go out by boat to vist the town's mysterious island which floats in the middle of the sea, Ailsa Craig. What adventures and mysteries can be found there, no one knows. Gold and Iron are the lifeblood of the economy and Girvan is blessed with a both mine. Seams of the valuable yellow and grey stone can be found near Girvan's surrounding area. Each day, hardworking Girvanites need only walk a short distance to reach the gold mine. By working there, County of Galloway pays miners 15 pounds in total. The mined gold is transported under tight security to the county's coffers. When Ayr closed, it was merged with Girvan\u00a0and its level 2 port along with it.\u00a0The port allows ships to dock in the town and people who are abroad said ships can go onshore and speak to the locals as well as buy local products. The port itself contains a total of six spaces after two jetties were constructed. The first, which was the first of its type in Scotland, was built during the early Winter months of 1463 and finished construction during February of that year. The second jetty was completed in September of the same year following delays with the availability of professionals and a potential war outbreak.History Of Girvan  Girvan's Start Irish Exodus War over Girvan Girvan, Scotland 1458 Move to Galloway The Stork has Landed Port Force Docking, September 1462Places in Girvan  The Parish Church It is a quaint old church, rebuilt not long ago from the fire. Set at the edge of the picturesque forest, the parish church has a chapel, the priest's quarters, an underground cellar and the important bell tower. The cozy chapel is filled with tapestries woven by the local weavers. Warm in winter and cool in summer, Girvan's church gives praise to its builders and the quality stone brought from Largs. When the bell tower forged from in Muirkirk rings with the age old sound, Girvan's parishioners enter for mass and partake of the rich red wine found in the cellars. As part of the URAC's priest exchange programme. Father Cow of Girvan and Father 2old of Lanark exchanged parishes for a month. This took place in the month of January 1458 Ailsa Craig Isle, known as \"That Isle\" by the locals derives its name from Ailsa and Craig. Nothing much is known about Ailsa and Craig, perhaps they were the owners of the island in days long past or maybe they were ancient celtic names of unknown deities said to live on barren islands such as this. Ailsa Craig is located approximately 16 km (10 miles) west of Girvan. The waters surrounding the Isle teems with fishes of all variety. Fishermen fishing near the Isle have told tales of bigger and better catches. There is a lighthouse on the east coast facing the mainland and a ruined keep of uncertain origins perched on the hillside above. Many have tried to explore the ruined keep in search of adventure. Stories of ghosts and lost treasures excite the imagination but nothing has been found.Mayors Of Girvan Honourable Mentions  Below is a list of some of Girvan's finest and greatests residents be it due to the things they have accomplished while living in the town or because they put a smile on everyone's faces. Some might of left town and others might of left RK all together but their spirits shall live on in the memories of those who were fortunate enough to have met them.Local Taverns  In the past, Girvan had 10 taverns. However with time, some of the taverns were pulled down or destroyed. New taverns have sprung up and currently (June 1465), there are 6 taverns The Jolly Taxpayer has been Girvan's town tavern for as long as Girvan has existed. Popular with the locals, the Taxpayer is known for being home to the (in)famous Fretty's buns and cheap ale available for the small price of 0.86 pounds. The tavern, known by locals as the JT, started out life as the \"Town Hall Tavern\". With locals complaining about the corny name, the mayor decided to call for ideas. Town locals cracked their brains and after a few days, came out with many weird and interesting names. A poll was created and the name \"The Filthy Oar\" was chosen. Why was the name the filthy oar? Some people speculate that because everyone was fishing so often, Girvanites did not have time to clean their oars. Others think that maybe it had some deeper meaning, a reference to something other than just a filthy oar. Mostly, it was because the locals thought it was a comical name. When Ireland opened up, many prominent Girvanites left to the Emerald Isle. A wave of grief and defeat rose from all the products and good friends that had been lost to Ireland. The locals thought that all they have done for the past few months was for naught. Sensing that Girvan has reached a new page in her story, the mayor called for a new name to be chosen. The tavern's name was changed temporarily to \"The Tavern Next Door Burnt Down\" due to a mysterious fire that burnt down \"The Shamrock\" inn which neighboured the tavern. A poll was once again held and the contest came down to 2 names; \"The Jolly Taxpayer\" and \"Saint Andrew's Pub\". The Jolly Taxpayer won out in the end due to popular vote. Since that time in 1456, The Jolly Taxpayer has remained the name of the town hall tavern until the mayorship of Vulture. He decided in his infinite wisdom to change the name to VULTURELAND in his honour which brought about many comments from locals. Once Vulture left office The Jolly Taxpayer name was returned to its rightful place.

There are three main stats that are found in the game: Strength, Intelligence and Charisma. When characters start at level 0, all three stat levels are at zero. By eating certain food, particularly stat food, a character can increase their stats up to a maximum of 255. Stats can be decreased when a character dies, fails to eat enough hunger points every day, is jailed for longer than three days or is executed. Because certain stats can improve the efficiency of certain actions, some job offers will require a specific level of strength or intelligence. Charisma has benefits in the purchase of goods or in competing for a job. When judging between two equally qualified candidates, the one with higher charisma's offer or bid will be accepted.Strength  Strength can be raised by 2 points per meat eaten. It is used to determine the level of success in robbery, war and tilling certain kinds of fields.Intelligence  Intelligence can be raised by 1 point by consuming milk or 2 points by consuming fish. It is used for tilling certain kinds of fields and is also used to determine resource collection, such as fishing, picking in the orchard or cutting wood in the forests, depending on which town resource is available. You are also rumoured to temporarily lose intelligence stat points if you are too drunk, very silly thing to do!Charisma  Charisma can be raised by 1 point by eating fruit or vegetables. It is used to determine the success of revolts and the army as well as influencing success in apply for jobs and the purchase of goods. Beware these stat points temporarily decrease if you have drunk too much in the taverns, and may permanently decrease if you are too drunk.Leveling  Each level require certain minimums of stats before a character can level up. To go to level 2, each stat must be at least 20. To go to level 3, two stats will need to be at 60 and another at 120, depending on the way that is chosen. Details can be found at the pages about each level.Way  Ways are career paths chosen after reaching Level 6. They are different from the professional or workshop paths chosen when reaching Level 5 in that the they are University schooling paths that lead the player toward a particular higher profession or career. How a Level 6 player advances within their chosen Way effects how they interact with Towns, Counties, Armies, Churches and Universities as their names imply.

Its creation was confirmed on November 2, 2006, by EA chief financial officer Warren Jenson who said, \"Yes, there's a Sims 3 in development and it's likely to be a fiscal '09 title.\" In July 2007 AI researcher Richard Evans, who is part of the TS3 team, gave a talk at the annual AIIDE (Artificial Intelligence and Interactive Digital Entertainment) conference in California, notes from which can be read here. The title was to be released on February 20, 2009 according to the official The Sims 3 website, but was delayed worldwide to June 2, 2009.Electronic Arts cites the reason for the delay was to \"create awareness for The Sims 3\". Before it was delayed, it was originally to be released only on Windows but after the delay, it is available on both Windows (Windows 98-10) and Mac OS X, which makes this the first time EA released The Sims on both Windows and Mac OS X (EA only made the Windows version of The Sims, The Sims 2 and The Sims Stories; Mac versions were made by Aspyr Media). In The Sims 2: FreeTime, a computer is delivered by Mr. Rod Humble to every household that a player plays. On it, Sims can play The Sims 3 game. A video of this can be seen on YouTube. It shows something towards a continuous, panning neighborhood, diagonal placings for objects, better lighting systems, and the ability to change shoes in the CAS, an ability previously limited to only console versions of The Sims. The preview only lasts about one minute, and has poor resolution. The Sims 3 official site also reveals that players now have greater customization options. Such things like personality, Create-A-Sim, and build mode have been expanded. The Sims 3 also is the first game to feature an open-world concept: players are no longer limited to single lots; they are able to explore the world in between and travel to lots without loading screens. The game compromises this by having much longer initial loading and saving screens. The game has disc-based copy protection \u2013 there is a Serial Code just like The Sims 2. To play the game no online authentication is required. This was done in response to consumer complaints with EA's other games that made use of SecuROM DRM, such as Spore.Description  The freedom of The Sims 3 will inspire you with endless creative possibilities and amuse you with unexpected moments of surprise and mischief! Create over a million unique Sims and control their lives. Customize everything from their appearances, to their personalities and even the home of their dreams. Then, send your Sims out to explore new locations around town and to meet other Sims in the neighborhood. Go online for exclusive extra game content and robust online features including $10 worth of free SimPoints and a bonus downloadable town. With all-new quick challenges and rewarding game play, The Sims 3 gives you the freedom to choose whether (or not!) to fulfill your Sims\u2019 destinies and make their wishes come true.Neighborhood  The neighborhood that ships with the game, Sunset Valley, is a beautiful setting with 97 lots full of characters. The description of this neighborhood reveals that The Sims 3 is indeed a prequel to The Sims and The Sims 2 (Although The Sims 3 is the successor to both games), as Sunset Valley was apparently built before Pleasantview, and founded by the Goth family. A second neighborhood named Riverview is available as a free download in The Sims 3 Store when the game is registered. The Sims 3: World Adventures introduced three sub-neighborhoods, Champs Les Sims, Shang Simla and Al Simhara. Each sub-neighborhood is a unique, exotic environment that is as large as a regular neighborhood. The Sims 3: Ambitions and The Sims 3 Deluxe compilation pack come with Twinbrook. The Sims 3: Late Night comes with the neighborhood Bridgeport. The Sims 3: Pets and The Sims 3 Plus Pets compilation pack comes with Appaloosa Plains. The Sims 3: Showtime comes with Starlight Shores. The Sims 3: Supernatural comes with Moonlight Falls. The Sims 3: University Life introduced a fourth sub-neighborhood named Sims University, where Young Adult or older Sims can go to college. The Sims 3: Island Paradise comes with Isla Paradiso. The Sims 3: Into the Future introduced a fifth sub-neighborhood named Oasis Landing. Aside from Riverview, more downloadable neighborhoods are available for sale from The Sims 3 Store. Barnacle Bay, a pirate-themed neighborhood, costs 2,000 SimPoints. Hidden Springs is a mountainous downloadable neighborhood on The Sims 3 website and costs 2,250 SimPoints. Sunlit Tides is a group of islands which has two versions: standard version costing 2,450 SimPoints and gold costing 4,350. Lunar Lakes is a neighborhood located on a foreign planet and costs 2,200 SimPoints. Lucky Palms, a desert-themed neighborhood, has two versions: standard and gold; the standard version costs 2,450 SimPoints, while the gold version costs 4,350. In December 2012, Monte Vista was available to download from The Sims 3 Store, and only came in a standard version. In February 2013, Aurora Skies was released to download from The Sims 3 Store. The standard version costs 2,450 SimPoints while the gold version costs 3,900 SimPoints. Dragon Valley, a medieval themed world, was released costing $20 for the standard version, and $30 for the gold version. In September 2013, a Gothic themed world, called Midnight Hollow costs 2,450 SimPoints for the standard and 4,350 for the gold. Roaring Heights featured a 1920s to 1940s world, costing $20 for the standard and $35 for the gold. A new neighborhood, Adventureland is shipped with patch 69. It is based on the base game neighborhood Sunset Valley, sharing the same description and image.Neighborhood Continuity  \"Before Pleasantview, there was Sunset Valley, founded by the Goths and built up by the Landgraabs to be a quiet, peaceful town. But when the Altos arrive with uptown ideals, will the townsfolk feel the need to choose sides?\" Sunset Valley, Riverview, and Twinbrook all take place before the events of The Sims (although at different times). Barnacle Bay is set after the events of The Sims 2. Although all other neighborhoods are not explicitly stated, they can be considered to take place before the events of The Sims. In an interview with producer Ben Bell and members from the EA Forum in the UK it's written \"He said that Sunset Valley itself is set before the neighborhood we see in The Sims, as if it's a prequel to the story we already know. He said the Goths are in the town, as their younger selves obviously as well as other familiar names and faces. Lots of new characters too.\" Agnes Crumplebottom does make an appearance as her younger self in Sunset Valley and players soon discover that the source of her crabbiness is due to the death of her husband who features as a ghost. Other families in Sunset Valley are the Landgraabs which are a very affluent family; the new Alto family, the Keaton family, the Wolff family, the Hart family, the Ursine family, as well as many others.Open Neighborhood  According to the Games for Windows magazine, \"The biggest change to The Sims 3 is that it takes place in a wide-open, constantly changing neighborhood \u2014 a much bigger sandbox.\" It was confirmed that the game would be an open neighborhood by the official website. The neighborhood is as such, and its neighborhood can be compared in vastness to the ones featured in other titles like Grand Theft Auto, Bully, Need For Speed Carbon and Burnout Paradise.  The loading of lots during play and lot-based playing has been eliminated. Now every action takes place in a seamless living neighborhood. In that Neighborhood there are lots, parks, shops and other places Sims like to explore. All Sims, and their Sim friends and family are in this Neighborhood. They can dine, visit, shop, and relax. Map Tags help players navigate the neighborhood, find interesting places to visit, and locate their Sims. Also, on the map, icons for buildings are different colors. Red icons are career buildings, royal blue icons are public places, light blue icons are for the location of Sims in the active household, orange icons are for other Sims' homes that the selected Sims knows, and green is the active household's house. There are also new public events in The Sims 3, such as music concerts, movie premieres, pool parties, barbecues, sporting events, outdoor fishing, and the most civic-minded public activity in a Sims game to date, attending a public protest at the City Hall, where Sims can voice their discontent with the administration's legal mumbo jumbo by angrily shouting their own nonsensical Simlish mumbo jumbo. When a child or teen Sim finishes school, there's a chance he or she may bring a friend home; there's also a chance the child or teen Sim may get invited over to a friend's house. The player has the option to accept or decline. Accepting, the player can then follow the Sim to their friend's house. Depending on how high their relationship is, the Sim can \"Request to Sleep Over\". If the friend accepts, they'll say, \"Sure, make yourself at home\". EA released a Create-a-World tool in December 2009, so players can create new neighborhoods for their Sims to live in.Buy Mode Build Mode Creatures Live Mode  The player has the ability to control one family at a time and can easily switch from one family to another. All the Sims of each city evolve together, but it is possible to stop the aging and the story progression so the Sims that the player doesn't control won't get married or evolve. Aging and story progression are different settings, and can be set independently. Both options affect the entire city and not an individual family. Free will can still be turned on and off, but also now has varying levels of High, Medium, Low, and Off. This setting is a game-wide setting rather than a save-specific setting. Currently, free will in The Sims 3 affects the entire city, not only the family the player is playing, which can cause non-player Sims, such as neighbors, to be passive. This was fixed with patches. The player can choose the length of a Sims life, from 25 Sim days (brief) to 960 Sim days (epic), and can also extend their life by eating a life fruit, a growable garden item. All Sims within the city will age according to the player's settings.Difficulty Levels  Families are rated by how difficult they are to play. Difficulty is based on Sim relations, traits, number of family members, and children. There are six levels of difficulty.Interactions with Other Sims  As Sims interact with other Sims, they learn about them. The opinion the Sim has with the Sim they are currently interacting with and their traits are displayed on the screen. The type of relationship a Sim has with another is displayed in the relationship panel. Each Sim has different interactions based on their traits.Sims  Improvements to Sims include more customization options, a trait system that creates unique personalities, Sims that take care of themselves, and wishes that allow the player to set short- and long-term goals.Create a Sim  Create a Sim now has more customizable options for Sims than the CAS in The Sims 2. The player now has a larger selection of body types for Sims, and are able to create different hair styles for every Sim. The player is now able to pick their Sim's shoes. There are a total of 22 hairstyles for female Sims and 17 hairstyles for male Sims. There are a variety of hats and hair accessories that the player can use, but they all come with set hairstyles. Each of the hats and accessories can also have their colors and textures altered. Hairstyles can be chosen separately for each outfit. Compared to previous games in the series, a lot more things can be modified. It is possible to just change the nose, for example, and it is possible to use the 'dot' system to go into more depth, i.e. change nostril definition, nose tip scale, bridge height, etc. Accessories can also be added (gloves, socks, eyeglasses, bracelets, earrings, shoes, watches...) and customized with Create a Style tool. There are more styles for hair than ever before. Changing hair/clothing/face is easy, as all can be customized. The player cannot add layers when customizing clothing, but if the clothes already have layers then the colors and textures for each layer can be altered. The player can also click on any part of the Sim and the Create a Sim tool takes them directly to the right menu for editing whatever is selected. There is an eyelash length slider bar. Socks and shoes are also fully customizable. The player can choose the Sim's full name, age, gender, skin tone, weight and muscle tone. There are six possible skintones but only three of the six are realistic. The other three are green, red, and blue. There is a slider so the player can edit how light or dark the skintone is. For example, they can make a light green Sim with a dark green mother and a light skinned father. Body modifiers also use sliders that adjust weight from thin to obese and muscle size from flabby to muscular. With patch 1.17.60, sliders for muscle definition and breast size (female only) were added. Height still cannot be changed (due to conflicts with animation).  Players can now create twins (triplets, quadruplets, etc.) in Create a Sim using this button. Five personality traits can be chosen for each Young Adult Sim and above, with the chance to change them with a Lifetime Happiness reward. (Younger Sims have fewer traits. A teen has 4 traits, kids have 3 traits, and toddlers have 2 traits. Some traits are not available for younger ages. For example, toddlers can't be Flirty. One Lifetime Wish is also chosen. In CAS, only young adults, adults, and elders can choose a lifetime wish, but in the game, children and teens can also choose to pursue a certain lifetime wish early. Players are also able to choose from three types of voices and a slider to choose the pitch of a Sim's voice.Ages  Age types of Sims within the game are baby, toddler, child, teenager, young adult (default age). Adult (middle age) and elder. The lifespan of a Sim can also be edited, making it any number of days between 25 and 960.Needs  Sims in The Sims 3 have six needs: hunger, bladder, fun, hygiene, energy, and social, omitting comfort and environment, two motives found in The Sims 1 & 2. (Though their function is replaced by certain moodlets.) Sims are able to take care of themselves, allowing the player to concentrate on what happens in their lives rather than balancing their needs. Sims now have wishes which can be fulfilled or ignored, and these often correspond with their needs (for example, a Sim may develop a wish to \"Order Pizza\" if they are hungry).Pregnancy  Pregnancy in The Sims 3 is similar to pregnancy in The Sims 2. Pregnant Sims experience the same belly expansion, though in The Sims 3 the expansion is gradual. Sims can now read books about pregnancy and get medical advice at the hospital. Sims can also announce they're pregnant to their husband/lover, family, friends, and just about any person they meet. A Sim relatively high in the Medical career track can also give the pregnant Sim some medical advice and determine the gender of the baby. Pregnancy lasts 3 days and during that time the Sim will have backache moodlets, cravings, and in the earlier days, morning sickness. They also have a positive \"Pregnant\" moodlet throughout the pregnancy. When the day comes, a message box will alert the player that the baby is on its way. Wherever the pregnant Sim is, she will have contractions. The player can have another member of the family drive the to-be mother to the hospital, or tell her to go on her own, (the father of the baby will join the mother at the hospital separately, after she has entered it, and this applies for if the father is in the active household or not). After a few Sim hours the Sim will emerge from the hospital with a little bundle of joy. Boys are wrapped in blue blankets, while girls are wrapped in pink ones. If your Sim gave birth at the hospital and had twins,each parent will carry one; if she has triplets, the mother will come out with a baby basket and remove the babies when she gets home (the basket will disappear). Depending on how the pregnancy went, the player can get to choose one of 2 traits, both, or none. After birth, the Sim gets an \"It's a Boy!\", \"It's a Girl!\", \"It's Twins!\" or \"It's Triplets!\" positive moodlet which lasts for 2 days. Both young adult and adult women can get pregnant, but young adults are more fertile. Sims can give birth at home or in the hospital. There is a possibility that a Sim will have twins or triplets. There are higher chances if the Sim has the \"Fertility Treatment\" Lifetime Reward or watched the kids channel on TV frequently or listened to kids music. Triplets, when born in the hospital, are carried out in a large basket by their mother/father.Traits  Traits are like segments of a whole personality that the player can assign to their Sims. They can combine to create increasingly complex personalities. There are 63 traits to choose from in the base game, with Expansion packs adding more, plus some hidden traits which can be passed on to the offspring of service Sims (firefighters, police officers, etc.) or from Sims in certain careers (such as the Criminal career). When the player assigns Traits to a Sim, that Sim will look and act the part. Toddlers, Children and Teens get a new trait at their birthday. If children had a good childhood, then the player can choose a trait. If not, the game will give them a random one, which is usually negative. They\u2019ll have unique behaviors, preferences and advantages. Some traits give special abilities. They can be useful towards skill improvement (Artistic and Athletic traits, for example) and special interactions (Childish Sims can play with toys. Mooch Sims can ask for food.) Young adults and up have 5 traits, teens have 4 traits, children have 3 traits, toddlers and babies have 2 traits. With University Life expansion pack, Sims might be able to earn additional 6th and 7th traits by graduating from the university or reaching level 8 of a social group. The fewer traits a Sim has, the less complex that Sim's personality will be. For example, giving a Sim the Kleptomaniac trait only will result in him constantly stealing while giving a Sim 5 traits will result in more balance. A Sim can have any combination of traits as long as they do not contradict each other. For example, a Sim cannot be both \"Good\" and \"Evil\". Traits are genetic and what occurs during pregnancy can affect what traits are passed on. The parents also help pick the traits. For example, bad parents don't get to pick their own traits and will have randomly assigned ones that are generally unfavorable. NPCs can also pass on secret traits that only their children will get. The Lifetime Reward \"Midlife Crisis\", costing 20,000 Lifetime Rewards points, allows the player to choose a Sim's traits again.Wishes  Wishes are exclusive to The Sims 3 and provide the player with a wide selection of requests that keep their Sims happy as well as working towards some short and long-term goals and rewards. Wishes come from anywhere and everywhere, based on the Sims\u2019 Traits, their job, their skills, their friends or coworkers, where they are in town, or what they might be doing. The player can promise to help their Sims with a wish or throw it away. Satisfying these basic tasks will unlock minor rewards and increase the Sim's overall morale with a \"moodlet\"\u2014a minor condition that contributes to the characters' overall mood. Evil Sim just stole candy from a baby? This is considered a positive moodlet for this Sim. Having to listen to the annoying sound of the crying baby? This is considered a negative moodlet. Working toward a Lifetime Wish will win the Sim \"Lifetime Happiness Points\" that can be spent on extremely powerful items, including the teleporter The player is now free to pick or ignore their Sims\u2019 wishes without fear of some sort of mental breakdown. Instead, they really get to focus on telling the story and making decisions; the Sim just makes suggestions along the way.Lifetime Rewards  Points gained from wishes may be spent on rewards, either in the form of an object or a permanent change in the Sim. For example, with 20,000 points the player can choose to buy the lifetime reward \"Mid-Life Crisis\" for their Sim, which allows them to pick their traits again.Skills  Skills have been expanded on from previous versions adding two skills that were Talent Badges in The Sims 2 (fishing and gardening), and two that were hidden skills (writing and painting), plus 18 more skills added by various expansion packs. Four additional skills were also introduced from The Sims 3 Store and they include Artisan, Dancing, Gambling, and Violin. They still have 10 levels of proficiency with the exception of collecting. Sims with high levels in a skill will unlock new abilities. For example, having a high level of logic allows a Sim to tutor other Sims, cooking unlocks recipes, fishing unlocks bigger fish, etc. Sims get a \"Power Study\" moodlet if they study at the Library, which helps with skill-building. Some skills have a series of books, many of which can be found at the library. Reading these books increases the Sim's skill level for the skill in question. For example, reading a book about charisma will increase the Sim's level in charisma. The player does not see the skill in the interface until they unlock the first point, which can be done by attending a class or reading a book about the skill. The player can then view the skill journal. The skill journal displays statistics and information about challenges, for example, the Athletic skill journal displays the number of hours of cardio workout, hours of strength workout, and distance jogged. The skill journal will display other information depending on the skill. For instance Cooking will display the recipes learned and the quality at which the Sim can produce that meal. The statistics and challenges for Collecting are available in the skill journal. Also when Sims reach level 10 of a skill, they will get a certificate in the mail to display on a wall or sell for 1000 Simoleons.Careers  Many of the careers from The Sims 2, such as the Law Enforcement and Professional Sports tracks, are in The Sims 3. Of course, there are also some new ones. Sims can look for these jobs in the newspaper or apply right at the building where they\u2019d like to work. (Every career has a building in the neighborhood.) Sims are also able to make a living at home selling paintings, writing novels, or growing fruit and vegetables. To get some extra cash on the side if the Sim also has some cash to spare, they can buy out businesses and receive a percentage of the profits they earn. If Sims are less inclined towards pursuing a full-time career or are too busy skill-building, etc., they can get part-time jobs at certain career locations within the town. (Part-time jobs have a lower pay than full-time jobs and do not give career opportunities.) Part-time jobs are also available for teen Sims. Advancing in a career still depends on mood and skills, but also relationships with colleagues/boss and even certain goals that have to be fulfilled. The player can decide how hard they work while on the job. The option to work hard will increase the Sim's performance faster at the expense of their mood. Taking work home, schmoozing the boss, reading medical journals, or completing opportunities also have an impact on a Sim's job performance. Chance cards and at-work events can still cause the Sim to lose their job, but may actually help them get a better job in another career track. Reaching the top of a career doesn't mean they're done, either. If a Sim keeps excelling at their duties, they can rake in extra Simoleons through additional raises. A new feature The Sims 3 offers is branching careers, which allows Sims to choose a certain path in their career (for example, a Sim in the Music career can eventually choose to specialize in Symphonic music or Rock). The Sims 3: Ambitions introduces professions, careers that allow the player direct control over their Sims\u2019 work and how they spend their days, and the ability for Sims to register at City Hall as self-employed in a skill career.Features added with patches  Game Update 1.5/1.6 on 11/16/09 introduced several features from World Adventures such as the new basement tool that allows players to build basements up to 4 levels deep under a lot, new Pagoda style roofs, and the ability to place decorations on roofs.

Create-A-Sim also gained 6 new skin tones and 5 new Looks sliders (Ear Orbit, Ear Point, Jaw Underbite, Brow Definition, Nostril Rotate). Fangs and bite marks could also be applied to Sims in the Accessories tab. Online gift giving was also introduced and implemented within gameplay.

World Adventures, Plus Late Night and Plus Generations also include a $10 card worth 1,000 SimPoints.The Leak  On May 19, 2009, about 2 weeks before the release, a pre-release version of The Sims 3 was leaked onto the internet. The game was essentially as feature-complete as with the final retail build, but it was, according to EA, \"buggy\" and \"pre-final\", with certain features missing and is considered by the developers to be unstable. It was previously stated that players who own the leaked version of The Sims 3 would not be able to access The Sims 3 Store and would not be able to buy items from it. It is possible to report illegal copies of the game to EA.Expansion Packs  There have been 11 expansion packs for The Sims 3 developed by Maxis between 2009 and 2013.Stuff Packs  There have been 9 stuff packs released by Maxis for The Sims 3 between 2010 and 2013.Downloadable Worlds  Maxis also has a development team dedicated to creating premium neighborhoods for The Sims 3 available on The Sims 3 Store and in retail stores.

Players were paid for every robot made.Night Club  In this job, Sims would go to the club into the workers door and either work DJ or Dancer. They would be in competition with three other DJ/Dancer teams to get the most NPC guests in their area.Sunset Valley  Sunset Valley is the world that shipped with The Sims 3.Overview  Sunset Valley is very large compared to the neighborhoods in previous The Sims games, having a total of 92 lots with various playable characters and about 86 in total pre-made. The main part of the town is the park, where Sims can have a picnic, go fishing, or take a stroll and maybe meet someone new; there are also cinemas, gyms, restaurants, shops, pools, and other recreational facilities. Sims can now visit all their friends' and neighbors' homes and call up their friends with the new cell phone, for a night on the town. Sunset Valley mixes modern and futuristic building ideas with nostalgic architecture and design rooted in American suburbs of the 1950s. The town is very unique on all accounts and hosts a whopping 25 playable families. Sunset Valley is full of places to explore and has a very diverse cityscape, leaving players hours of fun while exploring alone. The houses in Sunset Valley are diversely priced, but every little group of houses are generally similarly priced. For example, the homes by the public beach are generally cheap, making them homes for lower-middle class type Sims, although (if viewing the water as south), the further west you go the nicer they become, until they're more like upper-middle class type homes. Summer Hill Court contains the largest, most expensive lots. The area directly behind city hall has some of the poorest houses, and behind that zone is a middle class area. Along the east side of Sunset Valley are some very nice homes, probably for upper-middle class Sims. There are 21 available empty lots for players to build on. They are priced from \u00a71200 at the cheapest, to \u00a714,700 as the most expensive. The amount of space (in squares) for building goes from 19x29 at the smallest to 60x60 at the largest. The most expensive lot, 15 Summer Hill Court, is on the same hill as the Landgraabs' and Alto's mansions (although if the Pets expansion pack has been installed, this lot may be taken up by the equestrian center).Lots Residential lots Inhabited  All owned are considered households.Empty Lots Community lots  Rabbit holes are not listedFamilies New families  There are a total of 86 Sims living in Sunset Valley.Returning families Families in the Family bin Homeless Sims  These Sims are pre-made, but homeless when Sunset Valley is first loadedMobile version  Sunset Valley was totally different in the mobile version. The park in the middle of town was replaced with a small lake, and only a few neighborhoods and families from the PC version were found here.Trivia The Sims 3: Ambitions  The Sims 3: Ambitions is the second expansion pack for The Sims 3 released on June 1, 2010. It allows players to become \"fearless heroes and ace entrepreneurs\". In other words, it's a career oriented expansion pack, a spiritual remake of The Sims 2: Open for Business, but with added activities. Ambitions also appears to be somewhat related to The Sims 2: FreeTime. EA Games confirmed Ambitions on March 4, 2010. The Sims 3: Ambitions is also available for feature phones, iPhone and iPod touch. There are new features such as babies and being able to fully edit your home. A free patch for The Sims 3 was released on May 28, 2010. It introduced tattoos and other updates to the base game. The new Create a Pattern tool is a free download just like the Create a World tool, and was released on June 23, 2010.Description  Imagine a world where you can make your Sim anything they want to be. Widen your Sim's horizons with a bunch of killer career opportunities. With The Sims 3: Ambitions, decide whether your Sim will be the brave town hero, cause loads of mischief among their neighbors, or give some style advice. Make your Sim save the day as a brave firefighter, change your town as a leading architect, or live on the edge as a tattoo artist. Will your Sim find success as a billionaire high-tech inventor or eke out a living as a bumbling mad scientist? Will they uncover secrets as a private investigator by dusting for prints or roughing up a suspect for information? Will they walk the runways as a fashion diva with exhilarating and swanky style? Their future is entirely in your hands!Game Summary  The Sims 3: Ambitions allows players to pursue a variety of exciting paths and careers in their Sims\u2019 lives that in turn affect their overall gameplay experience and neighborhood. While on the job, the player has direct control over their Sims\u2019 work and can choose how to spend their days. Players can opt to make house calls and save lives as a doctor or choose the devious route and test experimental medicine on patients. Be the heroic firefighter tackling raging infernos or smashing everything in sight at the victim\u2019s home with an axe; take a shot at solving cases as an investigator, nicely convincing sources to divulge secrets or roughing up perpetrators in a dark alley to get information. Players can now experience some of the most exciting and varied jobs. In The Sims 3: Ambitions, players can choose to hunt down vengeful spirits as the ghost hunter, invent brilliant and potentially destructive gadgets as an inventor, craft glorious masterpieces as a sculptor, and solve riveting cases by any means necessary as an investigator with dozens of cases to solve and numerous clues to find. Additionally, players will be able to change the look and feel of their town by becoming an architect and directly affecting the neighborhood around them leveraging Build and Buy mode. The stylist career and new tattoo system allow players to make over their Sim neighbors in fashionable or catastrophic ways. For the first time, players will be in charge of how their Sims\u2019 career progresses and decide if they will work for good or evil, pursue creative endeavors or technical affairs, climb to the top quickly, or be a slacker. The future of a Sims\u2019 success or failure is entirely in the hands of the player.Features Leaked images  In May 2010, leaked images of Ambitions surfaced, allegedly through a Russian journalist breaching disclosure policies. These images were distributed more widely by the Brazilian fan website, O Sim BR.net. The legal ramifications of republishing these images is currently unknown. The images show a clear overhead view of Twinbrook, confirming it as the town in the second trailer (Iron Man parody). They also show an explosion at a junkyard, the inside of a salon, a secret agent in 'disguise', a Sim at a drafting board, several new hair styles, applying tattoos, a clothes line, and a new motorbike.Trivia Advanced Cheats  The icons that are shown on the map are shown in numerous colors. To buy and build modes Purchase / Construction in all situations, freely. For example, during a fire and burglar. Allows use of foundation on top tile floors.External links The Sims 3: Generations  The Sims 3: Generations is the fourth expansion pack for The Sims 3. The game was released on May 31, 2011. It contains elements of The Sims 2: Celebration Stuff, The Sims 2: Family Fun Stuff, The Sims: House Party, The Sims 2: Teen Style Stuff, The Sims 2: FreeTime, and The Sims 2: University. Each life phase has a theme. For children, imagination and make-believe are key themes. For teens, rebellious, chaotic scenes such as parties and pranks are an addition. As a young adult and adult, the focus is on their relationships with others, from getting married to having children of their own. Elders get to enjoy their time reminiscing about the golden years and the joys of watching their grandchildren grow up. There are also now 5 schools (including Military school, Prep School and Art School) for Children and Teenagers to go to.Description  Enjoy a whole spectrum of rich life experiences with your Sims! Start off in the imagination-fuelled world of childhood and embrace the drama of the teen years. Experience the complicated realities of adult life, then reap the benefits of growing up in each life stage. A wealth of new options and activities makes your Sims' lives more meaningful than ever before, whatever their ages. With new celebrations, dramatic life events, and all-new ways for your Sims to express their creativity, The Sims 3 Generations lets your Sims live life to the fullest!Features Pre-Release  A trailer, which later turned out to be legitimate, was leaked on March 11, 2011 from The Sims 3's official twitter and Facebook. The trailer was leaked along with a trailer for a then-unconfirmed expansion pack, \"Unleashed\" (later confirmed as The Sims 3: Pets). Features shown in the trailer include tree houses, on-the-ground water slides, spiral staircases, mid-life crisis, family videos and pranks. On April 5, 2011, EA confirmed the rumors with a press release, followed by an official release of the trailer.Music  This is a list of artists and their songs that were featured in Generations:External links Pregnancy  Pregnancy is a game mechanic and multiple-day event that begins after a successful \"Try for Baby\" interaction between two Sims of the opposite sex, and ends with the pregnant female Sim giving birth to one or more newborn babies. Pregnancy primarily affects adult and young adult female Sims. Pregnancy brings many physical and lifestyle changes to the pregnant Sim, including increasing body size, faster-decreasing motives, and forced maternity leave from work. Pregnancy was introduced as a game feature in The Sims 2, and has appeared in each subsequent game. Prior to The Sims 2, kissing or playing in bed were the only interactions that could result in two Sims having a child - and the player could usually say yes or no to that. If the player said \"yes\", or was not given that option, a baby would immediately appear, forgoing any pregnancy period. Under normal circumstances, only female Sims can become pregnant. However, in The Sims 2 and in The Sims 4: Get to Work, male Sims can be impregnated as well, either through alien abduction or by the use of cheats. In The Sims 3: Seasons, male Sims can experience a sort of pseudo-pregnancy as the result of alien abduction. In The Sims 4, as of patch 34, a Sim's ability to get pregnant or get others pregnant can be set with the optional Customize Gender menu in CAS, regardless of the Sim's gender.Conception  To get a Sim pregnant, the two partners must \"Try for Baby\". When trying for a baby, there is a possibility that the Sim will not get pregnant, but if she does, the player will hear a lullaby song or jingle; signaling a successful conception. In The Sims 4, the lullaby song was removed, and Sims can use the pregnancy test on the toilet for a cost of \u00a715.\u00a0 In The Sims 2, only adults and elder males can initiate Try for Baby, although the InTeenimater mod can allow teens to become pregnant. (While young adult males can father children with adult females, the \"Try for Baby\" interaction must be initiated by the adult female at her home.) If the Sim is infertile, the player can testingcheatsenabled and spawn the Tombstone of Life and Death to impregnate a Sim. The number of babies born is determined at conception, but the gender is determined at birth. Male young adults, adults, and elders can try for a baby, but only female young adults and adults can get pregnant. Additionally, the chance of conception is lowered for older female Sims trying for a baby. Depending on what the player does or exposes the mother to during her pregnancy, it will affect both the gender and number of offspring the pregnancy will produce. In The Sims Medieval, WooHoo between two Sims of the opposite gender always carries a chance of pregnancy; there is no \"Try for Baby\" option.Meeting aliens  This section describes features that are only available in The Sims 2,\u00a0 The Sims 3: Seasons,\u00a0and The Sims 4: Get to Work.The Sims 2  In The Sims 2, when an adult male stargazes with the Farstar e3 telescope at night, there is a chance that he will be abducted by aliens. If he is, he will return after a few Sim hours, and will soon learn that he is pregnant. (Female Sims and male Sims of different ages can be abducted, but only adult males will become pregnant as a result of an abduction.) If NightLife is installed, an adult male Sim abducted from the ElectroDance Sphere will return pregnant. The Nightlife patch fixed a glitch which allowed young adult males abducted from the ElectroDance Sphere to return pregnant. If FreeTime or later is installed, Knowledge Sims with the Summon Aliens aspiration benefit can use either telescope to attempt to summon aliens; so an adult male Sim with that benefit can use it to attempt to become pregnant.The Sims 3: Seasons  There's a 33% chance a young adult or older male who has been abducted by aliens may receive the \"Unexpected Weight Gain\" moodlet after the \"Abducted\" moodlet has expired. While the Sim will give birth after the \"Unexpected Weight Gain\" moodlet has expired, he is not otherwise treated as pregnant. He will not be given maternity leave, will not change into maternity clothes, will not be restricted from activities that pregnant Sims normally cannot do, and will not pass on any genetic information to the alien child. It has been noted that this can only happen if the aliens performing the abduction are not residents of the neighborhood.The Sims 4: Get To Work  There is a possibility that a Sim will be abducted during the 9PM to 4AM hours. Male Sims may come back pregnant with an alien baby after abduction, as well as receiving the \"Abducted\" moodlet. Female Sims cannot be impregnated by aliens, but will still receive the moodlet.Vacation Romance  This section describes features that are only available in The Sims 3: World Adventures. In The Sims 3: World Adventures, it is possible for a Sim to have WooHoo with someone from the place they are visiting on their holidays. If a male Sim were to WooHoo with a female Sim who lives in his holiday destination (i.e. China, France or Egypt), it is possible for the female Sim to get pregnant. But when the male Sim returns home, his offspring can be seen on the family tree as a child, even if the WooHoo occurred the previous day. This jump in age occurs due to the fact that pregnant females, babies, and toddlers are not present in foreign destinations. In addition, Story progression is at a catch-up rate, meaning the offspring will not immediately show any age progressions through the family tree. Meanwhile, a female Sim who does the same will return home and give birth to the child, and the family tree will show who the father is; the baby will grow up in a normal pace.Duration  Pregnancies last 75 Sim hours in The Sims 2 and 72 Sim hours in The Sims 3 though it's common to refer to pregnancies as lasting 3 days in both games. In The Sims 4, pregnancies can last up to 3\u20135 days. In The Sims FreePlay, pregnancies last approximately 216 hours (9 days). The Sims 2 has cheats which can be used to reduce the gestation period to a mere 2 hours of Sim time. The lifespan setting in The Sims 3 does not normally affect the duration of a pregnancy. The motives of a pregnant Sim will drop at an increased rate, even if the Sim is not visibly pregnant. In The Sims 2, Sims who are able to meditate will still be able to do so while pregnant. In The Sims 2, it is possible to calculate the time in which the Sim will expand each day and eventually give birth. From the hour in which a Sim becomes pregnant, she will expand 25 Sim hours later each day until she gives birth. So a female who becomes pregnant at one o'clock on Tuesday, will expand at two on Wednesday, three on Thursday, and give birth at four on Friday. In The Sims 3, a Sim who is at level 5 or higher in the Medicine career track can determine the gender of the baby.First Trimester  The first trimester lasts one day only. During this trimester the pregnant Sim will suffer from morning sickness, which usually leads them to throwing up in the toilet, with a thought bubble showing a pacifier and a question mark. In The Sims 2, Sims with high body skill may have a better chance of not throwing up, though they will still be visibly queasy, and their comfort meter may at times go into the red. Sims do not always throw up when pregnant, but they may wake up in the middle of the night to vomit. In The Sims 2, the Sim will not be visibly pregnant. In The Sims 3, the bulge cannot be seen unless the player zooms in. Sims with the grumpy trait will be aggravated by morning sickness. During the first trimester, the pregnant Sim can't leap into other Sims' arms and other Sims can't leap into her/his arms. Pregnant Sims in The Sims 2 may have random drops in the hunger motive, which may take newer players by surprise. Also if a Sim suffers from morning sickness, and there is no toilet on the lot, the Sim will throw up on the floor/ground instead. In The Sims 4, the player can have the prospective mother do a pregnancy test after trying for a baby. This is done by selecting the action at the toilet. If the Sim is pregnant, a \"First Trimester\" moodlet will appear, and will last 24 hours.\u00a0When a pregnancy test is not done the Sim will appear pregnant around 24 hours after conception.Second Trimester  The second trimester lasts one day. At some point in the day, the pregnant Sim will attract the player's attention and change appearance. Their abdomen will expand and they will begin to wear maternity clothing. In The Sims 3, the bulge is nearly non-existent at first, but progressively grows larger. If the pregnant Sim has a job, they will be placed on maternity leave, and the carpool will not appear. In The Sims 2, however, a pregnant Sim who has access to a car can drive to work. In The Sims 2, the Sim will be paid for these leave days even if they fall on one of their days off. Also, in The Sims 2, calling a Sim who is on maternity leave during his or her work hours will still result in the \"<Sim> is working\" messages, and a Sim who \"brings a friend\" home from work may bring a pregnant Sim. There will be new social interactions, \"Rub Belly\" and \"Talk to Belly\" ; \"Feel Tummy\", \"Listen to Tummy\", and \"Talk to Tummy\", and the pregnant Sim may \"Ask to Feel Tummy\". The pregnant Sim and father can announce the pregnancy to others. In The Sims 2, a Sim at this point will no longer be able to do yoga or work out in front of a stereo, but will be able to work out in front of a television. The Sim may be able to use some types of exercise equipment, but will not be able to use all types. The combined effects of pregnancy and working out will be hard on the Sim's motives, but this does not appear to pose any other risk. A pregnant Sim will be able to swim, but will be unable to use a diving board or pool slide. Pregnant Sims in the second and third trimesters can also expect to have cravings, in the form of more \"Eat...\" wants/wishes (depending on which game) for specific foods. These are easy to fulfill, since they'll usually be a dish the Sim knows how to cook. In The Sims 4, a Sim in the second trimester may get a morning sickness moodlet upon waking from sleep. This will make them uncomfortable, and possibly even make them throw up.Third Trimester  The third trimester lasts one day. The expectant Sim will get the attention of the player and the abdomen will enlarge again. They can no longer drive, take a taxi, use the swing, or use the electro-dance sphere from Nightlife. They will suffer from mood swings, in which the outcome of Social interactions between the pregnant Sim and another will change. In The Sims 3, they will get negative moodlets, such as the \"Sore\" moodlet, and may no longer run. In The Sims 4, the third trimester can last 1 or more days, as birth can happen at any time rather than at a set time as in previous games.Birth  On the last day of the pregnancy the Sim will attract the viewer once again and go into 'labor'. This is an autonomous action and all Sims on the lot or nearby will be drawn to the Sim to 'panic'. In The Sims 3 and in The Sims 4: Get to Work, the pregnant Sim can be taken to the hospital when clicked on while in labor, or they can stay at home, and have a safe and comfortable birth. The advantages of giving birth at the hospital are that the baby's bassinet will be provided free of charge and the all of pregnant Sim's motives will be replenished. In The Sims 2, a screen will come up with the message \"There's a new family member on the way!\" or \"There's TWO new babies in the family!\" (if the Sim is having twins)\u00a0at which time the genetics and gender of the new baby (or babies) are determined. If the special camera is enabled, a cinematic will commence showing the birth of the baby,\u00a0otherwise the Sim will turn around on the spot and a\u00a0new family member is born. If the Sim has a job, they will get additional leave in the form of three vacation days, regardless of the number of vacation days they already have. These work like ordinary vacation days; if the Sim is scheduled to work, the carpool will come, and the Sim will get in unless the player cancels that action. These vacation days will not be lost if they are not used while the new family member is a baby. If another family member can stay home with the baby, the player may want to let the Sim go to work in order to save a leave day for later. In The Sims 3 a little pop-up will say: \"The baby is coming! Make sure (Sim) is at home or in the hospital so she can have a safe and comfortable birth!\" If the Sim goes to the hospital, the player won't be able to see anything, but can still hear the birth taking place. If the Sim stays at home, the Sim will turn on the spot, and the new little family member will be born there. In The Sims 4 labor lasts several hours. The Sim can continue to do things while in labor but will be continuously uncomfortable. If the player bought a bassinet previously, the Sim will go to the bassinet to give birth when the time comes. If they didn't, a bassinet will spawn spontaneously when the baby is born. After the birth of\u00a0the baby (or babies), the player will\u00a0then be able to name them. In The Sims 3, depending on how happy the mother was during her pregnancy, the player might be able to choose both traits for the baby, just one, or none at all.Multiple Births  The Sims 3 and The Sims 4 allows for the birth of both twins and triplets. The Sims 2 only allows for twins, though there are third-party hacks which can produce triplets and quadruplets. Some players have also had a glitch producing triplets in The Sims 2 and quadruplets in The Sims 4.Twins  Twins are conceived the same way as single babies, so they will look about as much like each other as normal siblings do\u2014from nearly identical to widely different. With, for example, a light-skinned mother and dark-skinned father, the twins can have different skin colors. However, some pre-made twins, such as the Pleasant twins, are identical; and it's possible to make identical Sims in CAS. CAS in The Sims 3 and the Sims 4 even has an option to create a twin, which creates an identical copy of a Sim. Every pregnancy has a low chance of producing natural twins. Most Sims have about a 10% chance of having twins, although if a parent is a twin themselves, the chances increase slightly. This is decided at the moment of conception, so, unlike gender and genetics, exiting and reloading the lot will not change the number of babies born. However, with the Open for Business expansion pack for The Sims 2, EA did include a \"forcetwins\" cheat; using it when a pregnant Sim is selected will result in that Sim having twins. If a pregnant Sim eats cheesecake, also added in Open for Business, they will have twins, as if the \"forcetwins\" cheat had been used while they were selected. This is different from what is stated in the Prima guide for Open for Business; the guide states that eating cheesecake while pregnant increases the chance of twins, not that it ensures them. There was a myth that eating cheesecake prior to conception would increase the chance of having twins. Whether or not this is what EA originally intended, it is not true. Enabling testingcheatsenabled and shift-clicking a pregnant woman allows the player to force twins by clicking on DEBUG: force twins. In The Sims 4, twins share the same birthday.Triplets/Quadruplets  Under normal circumstances, it is impossible to have triplets, quadruplets or more in The Sims 2. Players may download third-party hacks to obtain the option of having triplets or quadruplets. When having triplets or quadruplets, the game informs players that the Sim in question has given birth to two babies, despite the actual number. Players are still able to name each child, though, as the option pops up twice. In The Sims 3, a player can use the fertility treatment to get twin and triplets, but not quadruplets. Players may download third-party hacks to obtain the option of having quadruplets. In The Sims 4, players can buy the \"Fertile\" trait from the satisfaction reward store to increase the chances of getting twins or triplets. In City Living, players may also use the \"On Ley Line\" lot trait to boost the chances of conceiving twins.Increasing Multiple Birth Odds Stopping A Pregnancy The Sims  There is no pregnancy in The Sims, but if a family is evicted while there is a baby in the house, the baby will be lost.The Sims 2  Miscarriage per se does not occur in The Sims 2, but if a pregnant Sim dies, the baby will effectively be lost, as in the case of Olivia Monty's unborn baby. Family members will not get a memory of losing the baby, only the Sim who died. If the pregnant Sim is resurrected, their pregnancy will continue as normal. The only exception to this is Olivia Monty, who lacks a pregnancy token and merely has the appearance of being pregnant. If a pregnant Sim becomes an elder, the baby will be lost. Normally, a Sim who is close enough to elder-hood for that to happen cannot become pregnant. However, negative effects of drinking the Elixir of Life can age a pregnant Sim to the point where it becomes possible, or even move the Sim into the elder life stage. In addition, there are hacks which can be used to end a pregnancy.The InTeenimater  With the InTeenimater, a mod for The Sims 2, the player can make a miscarriage when a Sim is pregnant. She will have a miscarriage in her memories. The PlumbBob will glow red, and the Sim will start grasping for her stomach. A thought bubble with a pacifier and a question mark will come up. The Sim will then be in her normal clothes, and start crying. The pregnancy may even end with a miscarriage (autonomously), if the pregnant Sim's motives are low, specifically hunger and energy. The player may also choose an option known as \"End Pregnancy\" which will stop the pregnancy completely, meaning that the Sim will lose the baby but will have no emotional distress or memories of losing the baby.The InSimenator  With the InSimenator, a player can buy the Reproductive Adjustor, which looks like a microwave oven. If the player selects a pregnant Sim and clicks on the Reproductive Adjustor, one of the options will be \"Abort Pregnancy\". Aborting a pregnancy sometimes makes the mother depressed. Another option on the Reproductive Adjustor is \"Suspend Pregnancy\", which will pause the pregnancy until the Reproductive Adjustor is used to resume it.The Sims 3  In The Sims 3, it is not possible for a pregnant Sim to lose the baby, without any cheats. In The Sims 3, if a Sim is impregnated or turns pregnant before becoming an elder, the process of aging is simply suspended until after the baby is born. It also appears that pregnant Sims in The Sims 3 cannot die, and will avoid or survive events that would normally result in death, even if those events are arranged by the player. Sims who have successfully conceived, but haven't realized they are pregnant, cannot die as well. There are many mods that will stop a pregnancy, however most of them don't have any negative effects on the Sim. If the player clicks on the pregnancy moodlet while pressing the Ctrl key with testingcheatsenabled on, it will not stop the pregnancy but simply deny the mother a happy moodlet during her entire pregnancy. If this happens to the \"Baby Is Coming!\" moodlet, the mother will remain pregnant but never give birth until the game is restarted. In several pregnancy mods, there are varying \"End Pregnancy\" options, some giving moodlets such as \"Broken Heart\" or \"Strained\".Increasing Specific Gender Odds The Sims 2  There is currently no definitely known way to influence the gender of an unborn child in The Sims 2. The only way to change the outcome is if the player saves while the mother is going through the labor animation, (or any time during pregnancy) before the \"new baby on the way\" popup comes up and the birth cutscene begins. If, after the birth, the baby is not the desired gender, the player can exit the lot without saving and go through the sequence again; this can be repeated until the baby is the desired gender. Since the chance of getting either gender is about 50%, this can take any number of tries to succeed. No Maxis cheat or fan-made hack exists to force a gender, though there have been many rumors, none of which are true. These include a fake \"boolprop force[gender] 100\" or the \"twinsr2cute\" cheats. Another rumor is that if a pregnant Sim eats gelatin it will increase the chance for a girl. It has also been rumored that the baby will be a boy if the father initiates the \"Try For Baby\" action, and will be a girl if the mother initiates it. However, this has been disproven. Making a Sim pregnant by themselves using the Tombstone of Life and Death will result in a baby that is always the opposite gender of the Sim giving birth.The Sims 3  In The Sims 3, there are ways to increase the chance to have male or female babies. Eating 3 or more apples during the pregnancy in each trimester will greatly increase the chances for the baby being a boy, while\u00a03 or more watermelons during each trimester will greatly increase the odds of having a girl. If the Sim is carrying twins or triplets, there is still a chance that both boys and girls will be born. Also, if a mother asks a Level 5 Medical Career Sim for the gender and eats the fruit for the opposite gender (e.g. hears from the Medical Sim that she's pregnant with a boy and then eats watermelon) there is a possible chance for fraternal twins born with different genders. Patch 1.3 of The Sims 3 keeps the apples for boys, watermelons for girls system, however eating these in prepared foods will not affect the gender. For example, watermelon pancakes will not increase the chances for a girl. There are many mods that allow the players to choose a baby's gender or tweak the chances in one direction or the other, but these mods all have their own rules and may not be subject to information given here.The Sims 4  Patch 17 introduced a method for influencing the gender of offspring. Eating strawberries or listening to pop music will increase odds for having a girl, while eating carrots or listening to alternative music increases the likelihood of having a boy.Pets  Like Sims, female pets are able to become pregnant and give birth.The Sims: Unleashed  Pets, like Sims, cannot become pregnant per se. However, if a male and female pet have a good relationship, they can \"snuggle\", which can lead to the player being asked whether or not they should have a kitten/puppy. Once the kitten/puppy is born, there will be a small box with a sheet over it near the mother, and the Sim(s) will \"welcome\" it by clapping at it. The kitten/puppy cannot be fed or played with, only viewed by Sims (while pets watch it), so when it comes to taking care of it, the player has to make sure the mother is doing okay. If not, then animal control will come to take the kitten/puppy away. After 3 Sim days, the kitten/puppy becomes fully grown. Pets born in-game have no personality points.The Sims 2: Pets  In The Sims 2, a Sim can command a pet to WooHoo in a large pet house with another pet of the opposite gender, provided that the Sim has a good relationship with the pet being commanded and the two pets have a good relationship with each other. The female pet will be pregnant for two to four days, and then has the kittens/puppies. Kittens and puppies in The Sims 2 can do things, and Sims can interact with them, unlike in Unleashed. Kittens and puppies cannot get jobs nor learn commands, but they can learn behaviors.The Sims 3: Pets  Pet pregnancy in The Sims 3 is mostly the same as in The Sims 2, with the exception of horses, as they are a new addition. Horses can breed in a box stall or be taken to the equestrian center and bred with a horse of the player's choosing. There is also a lifetime reward available for all cats and dogs that will increase the number of kittens or puppies that they have at once.The Sims 4: Cats and Dogs  Like previous games, pets can attempt to try for kittens or puppies. Sims will get moodlets depending on whether they succeeded\u00a0or not. If successful, a notification will appear.Other Player tips References Bella Goth  Bella Goth (\u00a0/\u02c8b\u025bl\u0259 \u0261\u0252\u03b8/) (n\u00e9e Bachelor) is one of the pre-made Sims shipped with The Sims game, in which she lives with her husband, Mortimer Goth, and her daughter, Cassandra Goth. Between The Sims and The Sims 2, Bella and Mortimer had one more child, Alexander Goth. She also had an elder brother named Michael Bachelor.Biography Life leading up to The Sims 3  In The Sims 3, Bella starts as a child (7 days to teen) who lives with her mother, Jocasta Bachelor, father, Simis Bachelor, and older brother, Michael Bachelor. Because she is still a child, she goes by her maiden name of Bachelor. She wears a red dress because this is her favorite color. Oddly, she has hazel eyes, even though she has brown eyes in The Sims and The Sims 2. When she grows up, she looks different from the adult versions of her from The Sims and The Sims 2; her lips are thinner and her eyes are much bigger. Bella and Mortimer Goth are best friends. Her traits are Good, Brave and Lucky. She attends Elementary School and is a good student. She is also slightly gothic, which is evidenced by her room and playroom being decorated with skulls, which may hint at why she married Mortimer, and also at her interest in the paranormal. She has one point of the painting skill. There is sometimes a glitch where her thumbnail, picture in relationship panels, and picture in wishes appear with her as a child, similar to Mortimer Goth. Bella has a good relationship with her family. She is said to be 'well-behaved' and the best dressed girl around. Worlds in The Sims 3 are believed to be on different timelines from each other, and it has since been confirmed by SimGuruSarah that the Bella Goth in Lunar Lakes graveyard is the same Bella from Pleasantview and Strangetown. Thus by the time of Lunar Lakes, Bella is dead. Her appearance (with her yellow hair, gaunt face and greenish skin) is very different in this town than in previous towns, but it is in line with other deceased Sims buried in the Lunar Lakes cemetery. How or when she got to Lunar Lakes remains unconfirmed, as is whether or not she ever reunited with her family after her alien abduction.Life leading up to The Sims Bustin' Out  In The Sims Bustin' Out, Bella Goth lives with her husband Mortimer Goth in Goth Manor. Her daughter Cassandra Goth may or may not have been born yet. She works as a Horror Movie Extra in the Movie Star Career and likes to play the piano and read when she's not working. Her favorite interactions are telling stories and nagging about friends. She has a completely different personality in this game than in the others.Life leading up to The Sims (console)  Bella Goth appears in The Sims (console) version with her husband Mortimer Goth and daughter Cassandra Goth living in 5 Sim Avenue. She still wears the same red dress and shoes, and has black hair. She shares a 90+ relationship with her husband and a 20+ relationship with her daughter. She likes to read, play chess, feed fish and mourn at the tombstones. Her brother Michael Bachelor is in the Family Bin as a playable character. However, their relationship is not stated, and Michael remains a separate character from her line of the family.Life leading up to The Sims  Bella Goth, her husband, Mortimer Goth, and her daughter, Cassandra Goth, are first introduced in The Sims. She is an elegant, yet athletic, woman who seems to enjoy playing golf. Her activities when played will either be painting or playing the piano, which gives credibility to the theory that she may also be a very creative and talented person. She also has quite a high interest in the paranormal.Life leading up to The Sims 2  By the time the storyline has caught up to The Sims 2, Bella has had another child, Alexander Goth, and has disappeared via\u00a0alien abduction. It is then revealed that Bella is Michael Bachelor's sister. She does exist in Pleasantview, but is hidden within the game code and can only be found using cheats or third-party programs. Bella's disappearance is a major component to the background story of Pleasantview and it's theorized that Maxis picked her for this major role because she is a mysterious, yet elegant, woman. Her last known whereabouts are Don Lothario's deck, and Don's photo album and memory panel show that he had attempted some romantic interactions with Bella, which she didn't accept, before she mysteriously disappeared. Many of Mortimer's, Cassandra's, and Alexander's memories involve Bella, meaning that she hasn't been gone for too long. On the family tree panel, Bella's face is not grey, which indicates that the game does not consider her to be dead. Although her husband and daughter have memories of her being abducted by aliens, the story does not explicitly state what happened to Bella. Oddly enough, most of the furniture was left untouched after she left. If a Sim uses the fingerprint scanner, much of the furniture was touched by her. Maxis created a likeness of Bella and used it as a townie in Strangetown. This version is a little different than the Pleasantview Bella, but is acknowledged by Maxis as the same Bella. The fact that the Bella in Strangetown has no memories of her loved ones or past life is simply blamed on alien experiments during her abduction. Strangetown Bella's career is randomized at the start of the game, whereas the Pleasantview Bella, if brought back, has no personality points, career and no premade memories, and she cannot be played without the use of hacks such as SimPE. Another odd detail is that, if Bella is brought back, Mortimer's relationship with her will be that of acquaintances rather than spouses. The reason for this is because the developers did not set the correct relationship flags. Some players prefer to play the Bella Goth in Strangetown and consider her to be the real Bella because she has no connection to Pleasantview and is not tied to the Goth and Bachelor family trees, which lends credence to the theory that the alien experiments left her mind wiped. A further area worth looking into is the cinematic when Alexander Goth goes off to university. If Mortimer is already deceased, the scene that the player sees before they enter the university features a regular Bella as Alexander's mother and she is sobbing about the loss of her son as he is grown up, but still remains missing afterwards. On\u00a0The Sims 2 website, there is an interview that explains her disappearance, saying that she is the same person as Strangetown Bella Goth. Another odd fact is that she is seen looking through a small telescope on Don Lothario's deck, even though it is impossible to get abducted through this telescope in normal gameplay. This might be a mistake overlooked by the creators to show good story-telling pictures for the neighborhood.Life leading up to The Sims 2 (PSP)  By the time the storyline has caught up to the PSP game, Bella is hiding from aliens in Strangetown. She still doesn't remember her family and likes chocolate. According to Mambo Loa, Bella is not good at keeping secrets. She is looking to sell her home (the Espiritu Estate) which she despises a lot because it is haunted by three scary ghosts (Emily Emory, Nervous Subject, and Dennis Philips, one of Hazel Dente's previous husbands). She sells her home for all the money that the player has. Bella's secrets from The Sims 2 (PSP):Life leading up to The Sims Social  Bella first appeared in a short interview promotion for the Facebook app The Sims Social. The interview confirms her abduction from The Sims 2. 'Ask the developer' thread in The Sims Social forum also stated it. Bella had in fact mysteriously reappeared in Littlehaven, a new city where Bella lived, set after The Sims 2 and Strangetown events, and it was her helpful neighbor Buddy who had found her. It appeared she had absolutely no memory of what had happened to her since the night of her abduction\u2014a whole chunk of her life was missing! As friends and family told her of how she had disappeared, Bella was determined to get answers and set off in search of the UFOs\u2014and her memories. She was good at it, too! Bella uncovered and met many an alien, mastering detective skills that Foxy Boulder would have been proud of. But alas, though she had successfully interviewed many aliens, they were not the ones who had abducted her. Each visitor pointed to another, and Bella followed the leads for many months. Eventually, after becoming exhausted following rumors and gossip, she settled for hypnotherapy in order to rediscover the hidden mysteries of her mind. Apart from uncovering numerous past life experiences, Bella did manage to recover her memories of the abduction! Pleased with the success of the therapy, she diligently wrote down in her journal for safekeeping\u2014should she be abducted again and be made forget! She plans to publish her notes someday, though she hasn't announced any dates. Bella may secretly hope to meet her UFOs acquaintances someday, but has since made peace with the fact that she's made lots of new friends in Littlehaven. She likes Chinese food (especially sweet and sour), would like to be a Fashion Buyer or a Mystery Customer for luxury spa resorts, and would like to visit The Eiffel Tower and The Taj Mahal. Her personality is socialite, and her career is chef. In the game, she is the tutorial Sim and the first neighbor the players' Sim meets. She is single and lives alone. She wears her signature red dress, red shoes, long black hair and has tan skin. The limit relationship with Bella is friendship; the player cannot become good friends or best friends with her nor fall in love or go steady with her. However, the player can perform romantic interactions with her.Life leading up to The Sims Mobile  In The Sims Mobile, Bella appears in this game to help the player to perform various tasks as part of the tutorial. It is possible to build a relationship with her.Life leading up to The Sims 4  Prior to the game's release, Bella appeared in a number of promotional materials, beginning with an Easter Egg in the first official trailer. She and Mortimer were later included as renders and in The Sims 4: Create A Sim Official Gameplay trailer, looking slightly different than in the final release. In the game, Bella lives in Willow Creek in the Ophelia Villa with her husband, Mortimer, and their two children, Cassandra and Alexander. This version of Bella Goth has been officially confirmed as existing in an alternate timeline to those seen in previous installments of the series. The Sims 4 version of Bella is a young adult, 24 days away from becoming an adult. She has the Party Animal aspiration and works in the Secret Agent career as an Intelligence Researcher, and has two skill points each in charisma, fitness, and programming. She is friends with her daughter and son, and sweethearts with Mortimer. She has no relationships outside of her household when first played. In the trailer, Bella is shown to have three traits, which are romantic, outgoing, and active. She's also shown to have an aspiration of Friend to the World, and a gregarious benefit. This version of her can be downloaded from the gallery, by SimGuruJill. The in-game version of her, however, has slightly different traits and aspiration: She is good, family-oriented and romantic, and has the Party Animal aspiration, but still has the gregarious benefit.Reuniting the Goths  A few people around the Internet have suggested many ways in order to get the Pleasantview Bella back. One way is to use the boolProp testingcheatsenabled and spawn the Tombstone of Life and Death to add Bella to the Goth family. Another is to use the inSimenator to summon Bella, improve her relationship to Mortimer, and set her as his spouse and resurrect her. However, she has the I Am Dead Token which will cause her to die. This can be removed using SimPE. When using boolProp testingcheatsenabled, Bella will be fine on the lot, but if the player leaves the lot and then return, the game will show her as having a ghost texture. The player will be able to control her for around a minute and then she will disappear. After this, a message will appear saying 'Bella has died on another lot.' Befriending the Bella Goth in Strangetown and moving her into a lot and then making her find her own place is a way to play Bella Goth, but only in Strangetown. Moving the lot to the Lots and Houses bin and then moving her into Pleasantview will cause problems in both neighborhoods.In other games  Her Bustin' Out biography states: Her name in Italian means \"beautiful\" and it fits her better than her red leather corset. Descended from a long line of occultists, mystics and decadents, she has thrown convention to the wind. Her disdain for the pedestrian and normal is only matched by her sense of ennui and isolation. She distracts herself from this world with a little organ practice and exotic gardenings of the lethal variety. Bella Goth is perhaps one of the most well known Sims. She appeared in The Sims Bustin' Out along with her husband Mortimer, she was in the TV family in The Sims 2 for Game Boy Advance, she appeared in The Sims 2 for PlayStation Portable, and she appeared in SimCity 4. According to her quotes in SimGolf (which she made an appearance as the download-able golfer, along with her family), she is very nice, an excellent neighbor, a little vain, compares bad things to Mortimer's foul moods and compares her family members to her shots (such as a Bella shot is too easy, a Mortimer shot is too difficult, and a Cassandra shot is impossible). She was also regularly featured on the cover for The Sims and its expansions.Easter eggs  There are many Easter eggs involving Bella Goth. Here is a list so far:The Sims The Sims 2 The Sims 3 The Sims 4 Trivia San Myshuno Reviews See also Ghost  Ghosts are featured in most The Sims games after Sims die. Some lots will have pre-made ghosts, and after Sims die, they linger as ghosts. Ghosts appear as transparent color-varied Sims.The Sims  Ghosts appear on residential lots that have the remains of a deceased Sim in a form of either an urn or tombstone. They can appear at any time between 12:00 am and daybreak but they don't always appear. When they appear, eerie music will play indicating their presence. They will usually hang around for a few hours doing nothing but just walking around while making windy noises. They take on the same appearance that they had when they died, except that they appear to be pale green-blue and transparent. Although playable Sims cannot interact with them, ghosts can \"Spook\" living Sims. When this happens, the ghost will sneak up on the Sim and vanish and then jump up behind the Sim while moaning and laugh. This causes the Sim to scream frantically and then run away, while some of his or her needs will be depleted. This \"Be Spooked\" interaction can be canceled. It will not override what is in the Sim's action queue, so it can be canceled before the Sim is spooked. One premade lot where Sims can see ghosts is the cemetery of the Goth family, which has the ghosts of dead relatives, i.e. Boy, Bratty, Uncle, Auntie, Grandma, Grandpa, Cousin, and Vegas. In Makin' Magic, magical Sims can make the Shed Your Skin charm. When it's used at night, the Sim who used it will be transformed into a green, ghost-like figure and will be able to talk to ghosts, as well as walk through walls and objects. Also, drinking Magic Nectar (x2 Grapes, x1 Fairy Dust) has the same effect as Shed Your Skin - but can be used during the day, as well.The Sims 2  There is a different type of ghost for each type of death in The Sims 2. Each has their own color and many have special abilities. All ghosts can scare living Sims - sometimes even to death - by showing themselves. Seeing a ghost is a common want for Knowledge Sims, and they will get a positive memory when they see one. Other Sims will get a negative memory. Sims may also have wants to \"See the Ghost\" of Sims they are enemies with or furious at. All ghosts can interact with some objects, for example: making a chair float or a teddy bear's head spin. Sims do not seem to notice or react to ghosts unless one chooses to make its presence known. The environment need of a Sim who goes outside at night while more than one ghost is out haunting will drastically fall down into the red zone.Abilities Angry spirits  A ghost can become angry if: Although all ghosts interact with objects and scare Sims, angry ghosts do so more violently. Normally, a ghost will only scare a Sim if they're close enough. Angry ghost will have wider range to scare Sims. An angry ghost may do things such as:When to expect them  Ghosts often appear just after 8:00\u00a0p.m. (20:00), but they sometimes appear later in the night, closer to midnight. Ghosts disappear at or around 6:00 am. They're never seen in the daytime or within the hour before or past light (with one possible exception). More than one angry ghost can appear at night, but it's more common to only see one. When there are only a few ghosts, they tend to appear around every three nights. When there are more than five though, they may appear every night. When a tombstone is on the lot, eerie background music may play if a Sim is outside. When a ghost is out, the music will be percussionary, and will play at intervals or whenever a ghost jumps into something. The exception to the daytime rule is if a grave is struck by lightning. A blue rod can strike a gravestone, resulting in a ghost appearing during daytime hours. They will float around the house for a much shorter period than they would during the night before returning to their grave.Keeping ghosts at bay  The easiest way to keep ghosts quiet is to move their graves to a cemetery. When there, several anger triggers won't work; however, a starving ghost will still be unhappy if there is no fridge. Mourning a grave will keep the ghost quiet for the time being, and building a moat around the grave site will stop them from invading the Sim's home, as they can't cross water. If Testingcheatsenabled is on and there is a ghost wandering around, the player can pause the game and make the ghost selectable, then just cancel the \"Haunt\" action and quickly make the ghost unselectable again. The ghost will then disappear. It is also possible to ForceError them, as this acts like canceling the action.Types of ghosts  Certain types of death don't have unique ghost color. Instead, their color will be similar to Sims who die of starvation, but their behavior might differ. The ghosts include the death by sunlight, coffin scare, and murphy bed. The wishing well ghost will be similar to ghosts of old age. Ghosts who were struck by lightning will be similar to ghosts of electrocution. The Running with Scissors Playset ghost will be similar to death by fright.Trivia The Sims: Bustin' Out (PS2/GameCube/XBOX)  In The Sims: Bustin' Out, ghosts work mostly the same as they do in The Sims for PC. The ghosts of dead Sims will appear at night and haunt the living Sims and scare them, and \"scary\" music will also play when ghosts appear on a lot. Only one lot, Goth Manor, has pre-made ghosts. The ghosts on that lot can be exorcised by using the Seance Table.The Sims 2 (console)  In the console versions of The Sims 2, all dead Sims become ghosts that the player can fully control. Ghosts will be able to perform different social interactions with living Sims, including the ability to possess and scare them. Their needs will be static in the middle. All ghosts look the same regardless of how the Sim died. Unlike most Sims games, ghosts will appear at all times of day. Ghosts can also be revived by winning a fiddle challenge with the Grim Reaper or giving him \u00a7100. Dead Sims are never really lost forever (or at least for a long time) as they are in the PC version.The Sims 2 (DS)  Although Sims cannot fully die in the Nintendo DS version The Sims 2, there is one ghost that will haunt the hotel. When the Cute Ghost painting is placed in the hotel, Sims may start receiving phone calls and text messages from the guests and concierge complaining about the hotel being haunted. The players may find the cute cartoonish looking ghost (who dons the original look of a ghost opposed to looking like a Sim) floating around Strangetown, he appears mostly in the lobby. He attempts to scare guests but can be temporarily removed via vacuum cleaner; he will return as long as the painting remains in the hotel. Due to the ghost not looking like a Sim it is unknown who he actually is, guests will just refer to him as 'Ghost'. He makes child like noises, so could be a child. The Concierge will ring the player saying the ghost visited and started crying. The player will never see the ghost cry, so he may be a relative of the player's Sim as he also appears to help them with social interactions.The Sims 3  Ghosts also appear in The Sims 3, and are fairly similar to those in The Sims 2. They also appear in different colors depending on how they died, but are much richer in color and appear to have higher visual fidelity than those in The Sims 2. There are premade ghosts in each graveyard and also in some houses that ship with The Sims 3 and each of its expansions. Unlike in previous games, ghosts are treated like normal Sims and can be interacted with as soon as they appear on the lot by simply clicking on them. They can also be turned into playable characters and can do all of the things normal Sims can do. They are the only life state other than normal Sims in The Sims 3 base game. The ghost state can be combined with all other life states. They are also seen briefly right after a Sim dies as the Grim Reaper comes to reap the ghost Sim from their mortal body. This also makes it possible for a Sim to fulfill a wish to see a ghost just after another Sim dies. When talking to a ghost, they sound like a normal Sim with a little echo. Prior to patch 1.26, they will make weird sounds such as screaming or shrieking. Ghosts move by floating instead of walking. They can become invisible, as well as possessing and haunting furniture. Ghosts, including playable ones, have free will actions which tell them to scare other Sims, but they do not do this all the time, and scaring Sims cannot cause death. The most ghosts could do is make a cowardly Sim faint. As of patch 1.6, ghosts float rather than stand (but do walk up and down stairs), and autonomously go through objects, walls and even other Sims. When a Sim's spouse dies (of any cause except for old age), it will still show the Sim as being in a relationship with their deceased partner. Therefore, if the ghost finds their living spouse (who will be shown as a fianc\u00e9e instead) doing any strong romantic action with their new partner, the ghost will be angry, as he or she will think of it as cheating. If a Sim goes around town and performs romantic interactions with their new romantic interest, girl/boyfriend, fianc\u00e9e, or spouse, he or she may get the cheater reputation. The player can stop this by having the surviving partner break up with the ghost when he or she is haunting. However, angry ghosts can be quite violent, so it would be smart to either put the grave in the graveyard, sell it, place it in a Sim's inventory, or hire a ghost exterminator. Another unique thing about ghosts in The Sims 3 is that they can also go outside of the graveyard to go to other lots and haunt other Sims, but they will only target homes that are somehow related to them. If taken notice of at the graveyard when they are already floating around, some ghosts will seen going out to the entrance and driving away in cars (either a Sloppy Jalopy or Big Lemon). However, the cars will look perfectly normal, not like ghost cars. Note that, when a ghost goes back to its grave, the relationships will reset to zero. Therefore, it is useless trying to have a Sim become friends with a ghost unless the ghost's urn or tombstone is placed in the Sim's inventory and taken into his or her house. Sometimes, when using the cheat ResetSim [InsertNameHere] on a ghost, the ghost may return to the Netherworld.Types of ghosts  As in The Sims 2, ghosts have different colors depending on how the Sim died, but their appearance is rather different. They have blank eyes, which is their most notable feature. Different ghosts may behave a little differently depending on their traits when they were alive and how they died.Playable ghosts  Ghosts can be resurrected to become playable using the Oh My Ghost! opportunity. The player can get this opportunity 2\u20133 days after the Sim dies. They can get married and have babies, including ghost babies. As a playable character, the ghost will be added to the household, like a family member. They can then be resurrected as normal Sims if they are fed with Ambrosia. Ghosts who have lost their gravestones cannot be resurrected. In The Sims 3 for console, a ghost can be brought back to life by using the Divine Intervention Karma Power. If a Sim in the player's household dies, that Sim will be playable as a ghost for 5 days. After which the ghost returns to the Netherworld and is never seen again. There are multiple ways to revive a ghost. If Sim has a death flower in their inventory when they die, Grim Reaper will take the flower and bring the Sim back to life. If The Sims 3: Ambitions is installed, ghost traveling to the past in time machine has a chance to be revived. Sims can also wish Genie to resurrect a Sim. Ghost Sims carry their own tombstones in their inventory which cannot be removed. If the player no longer wishes for the ghost to be around, the ghost can be dismissed by simply clicking on it and selecting the \"Return to the Netherworld\" option. This will revert the ghost to its remains, which will then need to be reburied or turned into an urn. Ghosts act in many ways similar to normal Sims. They eat food, clean messes, and sleep. Ghost children even go to school, even though they are dead. A child's grade always starts at C, no matter how high the grade was before death. If the Generations expansion pack is installed, a Sim who is good with the chemistry set or has a Ghost Potion in their inventory can turn into a ghost for three hours. While under the effects of the Ghost Potion, the Sim has the appearance of a ghost who died of old age and has all of the abilities of a true ghost; however, as they are not actually dead they do not have an urn in their inventory and therefore cannot use the \"Return to the Netherworld\" interaction. The console version of The Sim 3 Pets will have a karma power named \"Ghostify\" which will turn a Sim to a ghost and can be upgraded to choose a type of ghost. If the Supernatural expansion is installed, playable ghosts can be created in Create a Sim, and their type of death can be chosen. Deaths from other expansions can also be chosen even though the player doesn't have the corresponding expansions installed. (This is because the codes for expansion-ghosts types are carried forward through the different patches for The Sims 3. In order to kill Sims to get these types of ghosts, however, still require their corresponding expansions.) Playable ghosts of pre-existing Sims (as well as ghost pets and Plumbot ghosts) can also be added to a household by using the Philosopher's Stone. At the initial release of The Sims 3, ghosts were unable to become partners in or buy out businesses. However, in fully-updated games, ghosts can now purchase properties (including businesses) by using the \"Check Real Estate\" interaction on their cell phone.Related opportunities and wishes  Sims with the Gold Digger lifetime wish want more than anything to see the ghost of their rich spouse. This can be easily achieved by marrying a young adult Sim to a wealthy elder.Ghost glitches  In The Sims 3, a glitch might occur; when a ghost is haunting the lot, they may continue to haunt the lot forever and never return to their graves. In order to send the ghost back to its grave, the player must activate \"Testingcheatsenabled\", hold down shift and left-click on the ghost. The player will see an option titled Force Object; if it is selected, an option titled \"Delete it\" will become available. Select this and the ghost will disappear, as if it never came out to haunt the lot in the first place. This cheat is mostly harmless and can be used to send a ghost back to their grave if this glitch occurs. Another way is to send the ghost back to its grave is to use the ResetSim cheat (ctrl+shift+c, then type \"ResetSim (first name) (surname)\"). Type the name of the ghost into the ResetSim (without the brackets) and they will go back into their urns or graves. Another bug in the game causes ghosts on community lots to leave the lot and drive to a random unoccupied lot instead. The ghost will move onto the unoccupied space and then vanish. If the player attempts to interact with the ghost or clicks any interaction on it the ghost will disappear. Because of this bug, ghosts will no longer haunt the lot even if they are in a graveyard. This will also happen on unselected households. Prior to Patch 3, it was common for ghosts to lose their gravestone if the player switched families. That meant it could not be resurrected nor could it die. If a ghost is asked to move in and join the active household, the urn or grave for that ghost can be deleted; however, the sparkles on the ghost that died of old age will be lost. If the ghost eats ambrosia, it cannot be brought back to life. Deleting its urn or grave will also cause the ghost state to be permanent.The Sims 3 (DS)  Ghosts in The Sims 3 for Nintendo DS look much like regular Sims, but their features are grayed out slightly, and they are transparent. They don't 'walk', so much as they 'float', by lifting their legs up and moving. They cannot drive cars. They also appear prone to glitches, including getting stuck in the ground, and appear more frequently at night. They can be talked to, angered, and even flirted with, but a ghost has the extra ability to scare other Sims. They can go through walls, and when they move, ghostly Simlish can be heard. It is known that when normal Sims (especially Sims with the coward trait) try to interact with ghosts, their hair turns white, and the normal Sim runs away. when this happens, the ghost that the normal Sim ran away from will usually reenact the normal Sim's fright. Most normal Sims will run to the stoplight beside the road outside the graveyard, scream, and faint; ghosts will run there (or float), and will do what the Sims did. They will scream, fan themselves if it is a female Sim/ghost, and faint, but instead of being transported to the hospital after fainting like normal Sims, they will get back up and float to back to the graveyard. This could be a sign that ghosts are offended when normal Sims get scared of them. The 3 ghost characters are Sarah Abreu, Abrams Daigle, and Star Vega. Obviously, all three start out unemployed. None have lifetime wishes, but the players can give them one through the Mid-Life Crisis lifetime happiness reward. Strangely, Abrams and Sarah both have the insane trait, while Star Vega has the kleptomaniac trait. All three of these characters can be found at Pleasant Rest Graveyard, usually only at night. One can play as a ghost by befriending them, inviting them over and convincing them to move in. When played, ghosts act much like regular Sims, and can pursue careers. They can last indefinitely without food, and do not need to use the bathroom or clean themselves. They do, however, have a fun need, sleep need, and social need. When they get a job, or have a Magic Moment, the ghost will appear alive. This can also be seen if one attempts to edit the appearance of a ghost. Ghosts are generally quite grumpy, and are hard to make friends with. Abrams will usually reject a proposal.The Sims 4  The Sims 4 did not originally contain ghosts. When Sims died, they were permanently unplayable. Ghosts were added to The Sims 4 via a game patch on October 1, 2014. As in The Sims 3, ghosts come back as non-playable Sims that haunt the area around their graves upon death. Developing a good relationship with them can allow Sims to ask them to join the household. Ghosts change to certain colors depending on their emotional state: Sims can interact with ghosts like they can with normal Sims. There is a friendly interaction for ghosts in which ghosts can pass through Sims. Sims can also \"Ask Them What Happened\" to figure out how they died. Ghosts can appear at any time of the day. Having ghosts in a household is the requirements for 2 achievements. Ghosts can possess objects and go through walls and objects, though the player can choose which objects to possess. Ghosts can also break and/or \"Ghostly Repair\" objects through this possession ability, which is useful for Sims with lower handiness skill. If Spooky Stuff is installed, ghosts can wear any carved pumpkins on their heads, which will provide them with a happy moodlet.Types of ghosts  The known ghost types and their respective attributes are:Abilities  Ghosts in The Sims 4 can manually access their abilities, unlike in previous instalments it was an autonomous interaction. All ghosts can do a variety of ghostly interactions but they can also get extra interactions or effects based on how they died.See also References WooHoo  WooHoo is an interaction used in The Sims series, starting from The Sims 2, as a euphemism for sexual intercourse. WooHoo interactions can be carried out between two Sims, regardless of gender, that have to be romantically interested in each other. During a WooHoo, firework effects will appear along with bouncy effects in The Sims 2, or heart effects in The Sims 3 and The Sims 4. WooHooing will boost the social and fun motives of both Sims. While Sims can WooHoo without trying for a baby, and without risk of pregnancy, the \"Try for Baby\" action is also considered a WooHoo. A WooHoo is a special event in a Sim's life in The Sims 2. If cinematics are enabled, there will be a comic animation involving the first time a Sim WooHooes with another. Sims will earn a memory of each Sim they WooHoo with. If The Sims 2: University is installed, they will also receive the very first WooHoo memory. Oddly, WooHoo in The Sims 2 does not affect the Sims' gender preference. Sims usually desire to do a public WooHoo. Doing a public WooHoo will grant a special memory for the engaging Sims or a special moodlet and stride. WooHooing in The Sims 4 will provide a moodlet that affects their emotions, and it's possible for them to experience a good or bad WooHoo. In The Sims 4, teens can \"Mess Around\" with each other, although they will be fully clothed when they emerge from the bed. There is no WooHoo in The Sims. Introduced in Livin' Large, Sims can \"play in bed\" as an allusion and a precursor to WooHoo. Sims can also \"play\" in the two-person hot tubs from The Sims: Hot Date and The Sims: Vacation. There is a magazine named \"WhooNoo\" in The Sims; it is possible that the name \"WooHoo\" is based on that.Woohoo locations  The WooHoo interaction is possible in these locations:The Sims The Sims 2  In The Sims 2, public WooHoo is a form of WooHoo that is done using the specific indicated objects on a community lot. Sims may have wants to have public WooHoo. Public WooHoo gives a specific memory, and other Sims on the lot will react to it.The Sims 3  As of The Sims 3: Late Night, the game recognizes a public WooHoo, which is done outside the Sim's home. When they do this, Sims will get the \"Stride of Pride\" moodlet and do a fancy walk. Doing a WooHoo inside a photo booth is considered a public WooHoo, even if it's done at home.The Sims 4  If Sims WooHoo in community lots, other Sims will come to spectate it. However, Sims will not gain any special moodlets from it.Try for baby  Alternatively, a male and female Sim can initiate the \"Try for Baby\" interaction to conceive a baby. In The Sims 2, the female Sim must be on her home lot or controllable on a community lot. In The Sims 3, the female Sim does not need to be on her home lot to try for a baby. Trying for a baby carries a chance of conception depending on where it was done. Additional chance of conception is increased by certain conditions, as following. In The Sims 2, \"Try for Baby\" is not possible for an adult female who is less than 5 days away from becoming an elder. Once an adult female is 5 days away from becoming an elder, she may still be able to \"Try for Baby\" until 11 a.m. the next day. In The Sims 2: University, \"Try for Baby\" is not possible for a young adult female. Young adults can try for a baby in The Sims 3 and The Sims 4, and young adult females are more fertile than adult females; i.e. there is a greater chance for twins and triplets to occur. In The Sims 3, if a Sim becomes pregnant directly before becoming an elder, then the process of aging is simply suspended until after the baby is born. If the lot already has 8 controllable Sims on it, the \"Try for Baby\" option will not appear. Zombies, mummies, Servos, and SimBots do not have the \"Try for Baby\" interaction. Without hacks or mods, only male/female couples can try for a baby. A male between the ages of young adult and elder can impregnate a female. Without cheats, male Sims can only be impregnated by aliens. This can occur if they \"Stargaze\" with the more expensive telescope at night, though it is very unlikely to happen. However, if FreeTime or later is installed, any Sim who has Knowledge as their primary aspiration, and who has enough lifetime aspiration points, can choose Summon aliens as an aspiration benefit. A Sim with this benefit can use any telescope to attempt to summon aliens, and will have a higher chance of being abducted. Therefore, an adult male Sim with this benefit can, more or less, try for an alien-hybrid baby. The \"Try for Baby\" option does not exist in The Sims Medieval. In The Sims Medieval, Woohoo between two Sims of the opposite gender always carries a chance of pregnancy.Jealousy  As WooHoo is considered to be a romantic interaction, Sims who witness their loved ones engaging in WooHoo with another Sim will always get jealous, resulting in a significant drop in relationship with both Sims. In The Sims 2, WooHoo will trigger jealousy if the witnessing Sim is on the same lot where the WooHoo is taking place, even if they are not in the same room.Gender and age compatibility  The following table shows the compatibility of various age groups and genders for WooHoo/baby interactions. Note: when referring to trying for a baby, the table only states the possibilities for the interaction. As with all other romantic interactions, blood relatives and teens and younger are automatically prevented from WooHooing although there are hacks that allow both groups to do this, with the exception of Sims younger than teen. In The Sims 4, teens are able to \"mess around\" with other teens, an implication of WooHoo. The differences are that teens will not get a WooHoo-specific moodlet and they will not change to sleepwear when they mess around on a bed, though on the stats section of the Simology menu, messing around counts towards the statistic for times Woohooed. Because of its wide-ranging implications, WooHoo is generally not an autonomous interaction. In The Sims 2, there is a mod called Autonomous Casual Romance, which can be found on Simbology. This allows Sims to WooHoo and even try for a baby on their own, though the player can still forbid the latter if they want. In The Sims 3: Generations, newly wed couples with the \"Just Married\" moodlet may autonomously push the \"Be Frisky\" interaction, which ends in WooHoo. Another mod on Simbology allows same-sex couples to try for a baby; the Sim that initiates the action will be considered the \"mother.\" In The Sims 4, Patch 34 adds a customization option in CAS which allows players to give Sims of either gender the ability to get pregnant, or to impregnate other Sims.Pets  Pets can WooHoo in order to breed (producing a litter of up to four puppies or kittens), but they require a Sim that has a good relationship with at least one of the pets to direct them, and the pets obviously must have a good relationship. The gestation period is approximately 72 game hours, just like Sims. If a pet has a poor relationship with the other pet, they will reject the interaction.Death  In The Sims 4, WooHoo between elders that does not go very well has a chance to give the \"Dangerously Tired\" moodlet. When the Sims WooHoo again with the moodlet, they will die from overexertion.See also Realistic skin  Various high-quality skin mod packages for male and female Sims have now been created by fans of the game. These can be easily installed in a non-destructive manner and easily uninstalled if it isn't the player's taste of game play. Tested skin mods include: As with the No Mosaic mod package that removes the mosaic-blur effect when showering or using the bathroom, it's a matter of personal taste whether some of these more realistic skin options (designated above by the R and M ratings) are lewd or simply realistic and natural. Remember that The Sims games are played in many nations throughout the world and many cultures are not bothered by casual nudity being portrayed in their media or games. For the adult players reading this article, this is a roadmap that enables The Sims players to safely and non-destructively mod their The Sims/The Sims 3 games to remove all censorship features such as barbie-doll skins, or alternatively to as to improve the visual quality of the barbie doll skins without adding realism that the player might personally find offensive.Steps to install the above-listed mod packages in order (The Sims) Steps to install the above-listed mod packages in order (The Sims 3) Death  Death is the permanent state of existence in which a previously living Sim, pet,\u00a0or other creature ceases to live. Causes of death range from natural causes (brought on by reaching the end of the elder life stage), accidents, player neglect, or through the deliberate player choice(s). In The Sims 2, a deceased Sim's closest friends and family members will inherit a small amount of money through life insurance. If a Sim is married or joined at the time of their death, any community lots or vacation homes owned are inherited by their spouse. In The Sims 4, no such monetary inheritance takes place, although items in a deceased Sim's inventory will be transferred to their offspring who live in the same lot. All Sims who witnessed the death, including those not particularly close to the deceased Sim, will receive a sad moodlet (though household members who were not in the same room as the deceased Sim at the time of death will not be affected). Sims who witnessed the death of an enemy will receive a happy moodlet. When all Sims die in a household, or there are only children in the household (as in the case of The Sims 2 and later games), a game over occurs. In The Sims 2, any orphaned babies, toddlers, or children will be taken away by an on-screen social worker, whereas in The Sims 4, a message indicating that the orphaned Sim(s) will be cared for by social services will appear. In addition, when all teen and older household members die, all businesses and restaurants owned will be released back to the community (even if the deceased Sim has a living offspring residing somewhere else) and their prospective owners can generally only buy them as unfurnished lots. Although death is typically a state of absolute finality, there are several ways in which the dead may still be interacted with or even brought back to life. The spirits of dead Sims are often left to roam the world as ghosts, and there exist several legitimate (i.e. in-game) and illegitimate (i.e. cheating) methods to revive ghosts.Grim Reaper\u00a0  The Sim that has died is visited by the anthropomorphic personification of death in the form of the Grim Reaper. However, the Grim Reaper does not come if a Sim dies in a Skydiving Simulator in The Sims: Superstar, if a Toadified Sim is eaten by a dragon in The Sims: Makin' Magic, and if a Sim is eaten by the Cowplant in The Sims 2: University. In The Sims 2 and The Sims 3, the Grim Reaper plays a cameo depending on the method of death and the aspiration level of the Sim in question. Unlike most legends of the Grim Reaper, he seems to be a kind being in The Sims series. His personality is perhaps a reference to the personified Death character in Terry Pratchett's \"Discworld\" novels. His nice side shows when a Sim with a full aspiration bar dies of old age, during the animation of a pet's death, or resurrecting kids with the Resurrect-O-Nomitron. In The Sims Livin' Large, The Sims 2, and The Sims 4, a living Sim who is on the lot can plead with the Grim Reaper, asking him not to take the newly deceased Sim. The chances of success are determined by the relationship of the pleading Sim with the newly deceased, and pure chance. In The Sims, the Grim Reaper may be in a bad mood, and bring the deceased Sim back as a zombie. In The Sims and The Sims 2, it is not possible to plead for a Sim who has died of old age. Also, it may not be possible to plead for a drowned Sim, as living Sims will not be able to get to the Grim Reaper if he is out in the water. However, if The Sims 2: Apartment Life is installed, an infallibly good witch or warlock with 9 or more magic skill can use the spell \"Expello Mortis\", which will reach further out, though it will not be able to reach the middle of a very large pool. Also, in The Sims 2: FreeTime, Sims who have summoned a genie and successfully wished for the power to cheat death can plead for their own lives even if they are in the middle of a pool or have died of old age. In The Sims 4, Sims cannot plead for the dead Sim's life before the actual reaping begins. In The Sims 2: Pets, the Grim Reaper plays a different animation for pets that die. In The Sims 3, Sims can beg for their own life depending on the how happy the Sim was when they died. Somewhat \"dramatic\" music will play while the Grim Reaper is about. The Grim Reaper will reap the soul, leave a tombstone or an urn and then leave, similar to past games.Reviving  Death, however, isn't always permanent. With a wide range of items and/or cheats, a Sim can be given a second chance at life.The Sims The Sims 2 The Sims 3  In The Sims 3, there is a special plant called a Death Flower. If a Sim is carrying this flower in their inventory at the time of their death, when the Grim Reaper shows up, the ghost will offer him the flower. Seemingly deeply moved by this gesture, the Grim Reaper will proceed to instantly resurrect the Sim. A Sim can be resurrected once for every Death Flower in their inventory. However, it seems that the Sim in question will suffer from any lowered motives, just to a lesser degree, so it is incredibly important to use this second chance to raise these motives before the Sim dies again.The Sims 4 Intentional death  Players can utilize various cheats, objects, or game features to intentionally kill a Sim. This may be done for multiple reasons. Ways include:Limitations  In The Sims 3, due to the way gravestones are spawned, Sims cannot die in areas outside of lots. For example, when a Sim starves while standing on a road, the Sim will not die. Prior to The Sims 2: Bon Voyage, Sims cannot die on a community lot. In the initial release of The Sims 4, Sims did not starve to death outside of their home neighborhood, but this limitation was removed in later updates. In The Sims Stories, the player's Sims do not die during the main storyline.Types of deaths  Sims can be killed in a variety of ways which vary by game version. These include death by fire, shock, starvation, flies, being eaten by the cow plant and being scared to death.The Sims The Sims Bustin' Out The Sims 2 The Sims 2: University The Sims 2: Nightlife The Sims 2: Open for Business The Sims 2: Seasons The Sims 2: Apartment Life Other causes of death  Some things that can kill Sims do so by causing a death from the previous list. The following events do not directly kill the Sim, but cause death indirectly, usually by lowering a Sim's motives to the point of death.The Sims 2 (Console) The Sims 2 (Nintendo DS)  Sims cannot die in The Sims 2 (Nintendo DS). They will pass out when losing all their sanity, and recover in the Manager's Suite. They lose their sanity by having a low hunger or hygiene need. This is the same with The Sims 3 (Nintendo DS).The Sims 2 (PSP) The Sims 3 The Sims 3 Store The Sims 3: World Adventures The Sims 3: Ambitions The Sims 3: Late Night The Sims 3: Pets The Sims 3: Showtime The Sims 3: Supernatural The Sims 3: Seasons The Sims 3: University Life The Sims 3: Island Paradise The Sims 3: Into the Future The Sims 3 (smartphone)  There is no animation of Sims dying in the mobile version. Instead, an \"In Memoriam\" dialogue box appears and then shows a scene of a silhouetted Sim looking at the deceased Sim's grave with a light shining down on it. Tapping on the screen will bring the player back to the main menu.The Sims Medieval The Sims 4  Some of the deaths in The Sims 4 include hunger, fire, old age, electrocution, laughter, anger, and embarrassment.The Sims 4: Spa Day The Sims 4: Romantic Garden Stuff The Sims 4: City Living The Sims 4: Vampires The Sims 4: Cats & Dogs The Sims 4: Jungle Adventure The Sims 4: My First Pet\u00a0Stuff The Sims 4: Seasons Trivia See also The Sims 3: Late Night  The Sims 3: Late Night is the third expansion pack for The Sims 3. Its announced features are reminiscent of features also included in The Sims: Hot Date, The Sims 2: Nightlife, The Sims: Superstar, The Sims 2: Apartment Life and The Urbz: Sims in the City. The game was released on October 26, 2010 in North America, and in Europe on October 29, 2010.Description  For the first time ever, your Sims can experience late night fun as a VIP! Get your Sims an all-access pass to the hottest spots in town. Whether they mingle with celebrities or enjoy a casual night with friends, your Sims\u2019 social lives are getting a boost! But keep in mind that some scenes are more exclusive than others, so make sure your Sims have the right connections to get past the bouncers at the hottest clubs. Wherever your Sims go, they\u2019ll discover new things to become\u2014adored celebrities, all-night partiers, rowdy bandmates, or vampires. What will your Sims get up to after dark?Game Summary  The Sims 3 Late Night gives players all-access to and lets them loose on a vibrant, active downtown scene where they\u2019ll rub elbows with celebrities at the hottest parties, hit the local bar after work, tour the scene with their Sims\u2019 band, kick back in a plush hot tub, and discover what\u2019s lurking as the lights go out and adventure begins after dark. Players will be able to take their Sims into the bustling urban setting where they\u2019ll be able to become local celebrities, members of music bands, mixologists, directors, and more. To gain entrance into the most elite clubs in town, Sims need to keep their attitude in check, otherwise they\u2019ll be given the cold shoulder by tough bouncers -or they can find another way onto the list. If chilling is the player\u2019s forte, their Sims can lounge at a chic club or dive bar. Or, if they like to live on the edge, they can discover the secret of becoming a vampire. Whether embarking on a new career, painting the town red, or throwing a party on the rooftop of a penthouse, it\u2019s always up to the player to tell their unique stories with The Sims 3. What will happen when the lights go out and Sims get all access?Features Trivia Pre-Release  It was confirmed on July 20, 2010 at EA's Studio Showcase 2010. According to an official sneak peek at Late Night, it would offer players a more mature, realistic and urban environment when compared to earlier similar expansions. Previews of the expansion described it as being more about friend outings than dating and to be more simulation-driven instead of opportunity-driven as the first two expansions were.Events  Late Night has been featured at a few real-life and internet events.2010 EA Studio Showcase  EA holds an annual Studio Showcase where upcoming games are featured.

The skill is augmented by the Green Thumb trait, and the Super Green Thumb lifetime reward. It involves (as with gardening in real life and the previous Sims games) the planting, growing and harvesting of various plants that Sims can find within the game. Unlike the previous Sims games, The Sims 3 gardening has been much expanded upon, introducing many real-life plants and several fictional species such as the 'Life Fruit', 'Flame Fruit', and 'Plasma Fruit'. Some expansion packs include more varieties of plant collections. Some of the plants can be used as ingredients for Nectar Making and Mixology, with the key ingredients for Nectar Making being the grapes from Champs Les Sims. With Ambitions, Sims can register as a self-employed Gardener. Gardening can be profitable by selling the harvested produce from the inventory, supermarket, or consignment store. Only teens and older can tend gardens. Children cannot learn the Gardening skill, but they can learn the Child Gardening hidden skill. Once a child grows up into a teenager, they will earn Gardening skills at the same level of their Child Gardening and Scouting hidden skills. Once a Sim has maximized their Gardening skill, they will receive a certificate in the mailbox a few days later, along with a notification saying: \"The Dillinger Diggers Guild congratulates you, [Sim name], for achieving the very highest level of excellence in bringing life forth from our fertile Earth. Please accept this handsomely framed certificate and display it with pride knowing others will see just how skilled you are.\"Statistics Challenges  A Master Planter must plant 19 types of plant that can be planted in the game. Once you have mastered the varieties you will be able to reduce weed growth significantly on future plants. Botanical Bosses must harvest at least 75 Perfect fruits and vegetables. After so many Perfect harvestables, the plants of Botanical Bosses almost never die from neglect. Master Farmers have harvested at least 650 fruits and vegetables. The plants of Master Farmers remain watered and fertilized longer, meaning their gardens are more efficient.Plants  Plants and seeds can be planted at home. Seeds can be found on the ground throughout the town or upon reaching level 1, while plants can be found from the supermarket, vegetable stand, or harvesting from wild plants. Several plants are exclusive to premium Store contents. These plants are only included by purchasing certain premium contents (which are usually part of a set or venue) and installing them to the game. The plants and the premium contents are as following:Notes Quality & varieties  Harvested produce has a quality ranging from horrifying, putrid, foul, bad, normal, nice, very nice, great, excellent, outstanding, and perfect. Higher quality produce is worth more for selling and will have increased strength as fertilizer. The quality of the harvested produce roughly corresponds to the quality of the plants. Thus, an excellent apple tree will usually bear excellent apples, however there is a chance of harvesting higher quality produce. Produce can be used for the following: Generally, plants are used for ingredients. Store plants are usually used to complement other premium contents: Additionally, produces can be used to create jams and preserves with Canning Station premium content. Some plants also have their own unique variety, which makes them have other usages aside from ingredients.Mushrooms  Mushrooms are plants that came from Supernatural. The common use of mushroom is for Alchemy ingredients. Some mushrooms are edible and can be used as a food ingredient, i.e. truffles, porcinis, and white caps; while the others are inedible. Collecting wild mushrooms is also part of the Collecting challenges. Collecting 7 of them will increase the quality of mushrooms grown. Harvested mushrooms don't count to the challenge.Herbs  Herbs are plants that came from University Life. Herbs are related to Rebel social group. Herbs can be used as an addition to meal or herbal drink, burned in bonfire or fireplace, or eaten raw, which will give a moodlet and various certain effects. The moodlet time is based on how the herb is consumed: 8 hours if eaten raw, 5 hours if added to meal, 3 hours from herbal drink, and 2 hours from being burned. There's a 15% chance the herb will cause herb nausea when consumed, which will increase or decrease based on the quality of the herb. Below is the list of herbs and its effects:Coffee beans  Coffee beans are plants that came from University Life. Coffee beans can be consumed raw or as coffee drink from the barista bar. Coffee beans cannot be used as any ingredients or for the espresso maker. Consuming coffee bean will give various moodlets, which work like \"Buzzed\" moodlet from drinking coffee, which will temporarily override \"Sleepy\", \"Tired\", and \"Exhausted\" moodlets, as well as getting \"Buzz Crashed\" when the effect expires. Below is the list of coffee beans:Crystal flowers  Crystal flowers are plants that came from Into the Future. The main use of crystal flowers is as ingredients to create trait chips for plumbots. A crystal flower has 5 types of emotional charges. The common emotional charge is neutral. Sims can charge a crystal flower so the emotional charge will turn into either kindness, laughter, love, or rage. After that, they must charge the flower regularly, or the emotional charge will lose its power and eventually turn back into neutral. Sims can also neutralize the flower to change the emotional charge to neutral instantly. When the flowers are harvested, Sims can harness the flower or imbue it to other Sims. When harnessed, the flower will grant a special moodlet to the user. Only non-neutral flowers can be harnessed.Money tree  Money tree is a special tree that has money bill leaves and grows money bags. Sims can harvest the money bags and exchange them for money. Sims can receive the seed from certain opportunities, fishing, analyzing an unknown special seed, and so on. If tended well, money trees will never die. However, should it be neglected too long and perish, it will explode and leave many bills behind.Special plants  The following plants have the rarity of special. Sims can plant these seeds after they've completed certain opportunities. Completing the Uncommonly Good opportunity will grant the ability to plant cheeses and eggs. Completing the Outstandingly Rare opportunity will grant the ability to plant steaks and patties. Completing The Omnificent Plant grants the ability to plant omni plant and order its seed from the mailbox. These opportunities can only be received in order, but not necessarily consecutively. This is because The Omnificent Plant requires Sims to plant outstanding steaks and Outstandingly Rare requires Sims to plant excellent cheeses. Omni plant is a special plant which can be used to replicate many things. The plant can be fed with items, and once the plant is on its harvest state, Sims can harvest whatever the plant was fed with. The following are items that can be fed to the omni plant: There are several things to consider about the items that can be fed to:Fertilizer  Fertilizer can be used to increase the plant speed growth. Fertilizer does not affect the quality of the plant or produce. Most ingredients can be used to fertilize plants, as well as horse fertilizer from the horse stall. Below is the list of fertilizers, the time the effect lasts, and the grade. Depending on the quality of the fertilizer, the value and length can be modified. The fertilizer value will be multiplied according to the multipliers, and the length will be added with extra days. Furthermore, completing the Master Farmer skill challenge will benefit Sims by giving additional 2 days for any fertilizers.Tips Notes External links The Sims 3: Pets  The Sims 3: Pets is the fifth expansion pack for The Sims 3. The game sees a return of pets from The Sims 2: Pets and The Sims: Unleashed. Cats and dogs have returned, along with a brand new animal: horses. There are also snakes, turtles, birds, rodents, lizards, deer, and raccoons in the PC/Mac version.Description  Bring excitement and surprise into your Sims' lives with pets!

With a variety of new activities and social interactions, take direct control of your Sims' pets and explore new ways to mess with their lives. Give your Sims a new member of their household and discover all-new ways to play with life!Game Features Pet traits  Traits are also featured for pets just like Sims. There are total of 30 pet traits. Each pet can have three traits. More traits can be \"trained\" by reinforcing certain behaviors. Some traits are unique to one species, and some can be for any species. There are also some traits that will conflict with one another, such as Agile and Hates to Jump.Pre-Release  A trailer was leaked at the same time as the The Sims 3: Generations one. An official trailer has since been released, announcing the game. As with other expansion packs, there was a 'hint' in the Generations expansion pack, being a paw print on the back of any baby/toddler magical gnomes.Trivia Music  In addition to licensed music, the expansion will feature an orchestral score. Unlike the base game and preceding expansion packs that were composed by Steve Jablonsky, the score for Pets is composed by Christopher Lennertz. The orchestral score is available as a download from the iTunes Store. This is a list of artists and their songs that are to be featured in Pets:See also External links The Sims 3/cheats  These cheats require The Sims 3. While in normal gameplay, press ++ to open the cheat console on Windows and Mac computers. Cheats are not case-sensitive. When capital letters are used in a cheat name, it's to make the name easier to read, not because they are required.Miscellaneous cheats Storytelling cheats Build cheats Gameplay cheats Advanced cheats Shift-clicks  on a particular object when testingCheatsEnabled is true will bring up a special debug pie menu. This pie menu isn't as extensive as it was in The Sims 2, but there are some useful cheats. The following are the objects and their top level cheats. Cheats with a \"...\" have more levels that may not be listed for brevity.Control-clicks  If testingcheatsenabled true is on, using  + click on any moodlet in the moodlet panel will eliminate it. If it is motive induced, the bar related to the negative moodlet will be filled completely, just like when it is subject to a \"Cure\" by the Moodlet Manager. Entering testingcheatsenabled true on the load/new game screen, enables  + click between the chest and the points in the lifetime happiness to add additional lifetime happiness of 500. (Note: The click works for all the mouse buttons, clicking all of them rapidly at the same time will make the lifetime happiness points increase faster.)Drag-clicks  When testingcheatsenabled true is activated, you can raise or lower your Sim's current motive by clicking on any motive and then dragging your mouse to the left or right. This function can be also used to raise or lower relationship on any Sims. You can also adjust your Sim's progress in any profession if Ambitions is installed. However you will only see the motives change if you are in an unpaused game. When paused you can still do this action, but it'll take effect only after you resumed the game.Fishing (The Sims 3)  Fishing is a skill in The Sims 3. This skill is gained by fishing in the ponds or ocean around the map. The higher the Sims' fishing skill is, the more types of fish they can catch. Books can be found at the bookstore showing the bait that can be used to catch specific fish, but a Sim can determine the bait through trial and error by simply selecting a bait and seeing what they catch. Water can be inspected to see what known fish can be caught there, and whether the fish are active. The skill is augmented by the angler and loves the outdoors traits. Children and older Sims with the childish or insane traits can fish in swimming pools. When Sims reach level 3 in the gardening skill, they can use fish as a fertilizer for harvestable plants in their garden. The quality of the fish depends on how effective the fertilizer will be on the plant it is used on. There are certain types of fish that can only be caught if Sims travel to one of the three locations shipped with The Sims 3: World Adventures. Sims can catch frogs, snails and crawfish in Champs Les Sims. In Shang Simla the types of fish Sims can catch are doitsu koi, kawarimono koi, ochiba koi, tancho koi and dragon fish. In Al Simhara, Sims can catch crocodiles and mummy fish. These fish are exclusive to these locations and cannot be caught in any other world shipped with The Sims 3. With The Sims 3: Ambitions expansion pack, players can register as a self-employed fisher.Statistics Abilities  Every two levels the game announces the Sim can catch more fish and to check the bookstore. The Sim can learn the bait type for a specific fish species by buying and reading fishing books from the bookstore or just by successfully catching a particular species once using the right bait type. Fishing books are not available in the community public library. All aquatic animals caught fishing can be kept as pets in an aquarium or they can be used to stock a pond.Fish Notes Trophies  Fish can be mounted on walls by clicking on a fish in a Sim's inventory and choosing \"send to be mounted\" and paying a small fee around 70 Simoleons. The trophy should arrive the next day in the mailbox. Fish can also be put in fish bowls or an aquarium. Fish bowls can be bought in buy mode. All fish fit in a bowl, one fish per bowl or six fish per tank. Fish are nameable, but must be fed each day or they will die. Fish can be scooped out of bowls, and put back in a Sim's inventory.Stocking ponds  If a Sim has 10 or more fish of one type in their inventory, they can stock any pond with that fish. By stocking fish, a new type of fish is introduced in that pond. The pond will then contain an unlimited supply of that fish type for fishing. There is no limit on how many different fish types there can be in one pond. Any type of fish or any type of pond will do, including Deathfish and ponds not on playable lots. Stocking a pond with the Deathfish (or any other fish, for that matter) will allow it to be caught at any time of the day in that pond. A tip in obtaining better Death Fish is purchasing 10 Alley Catfish and stocking them in a pond in order to obtain a perfect Alley Catfish. Then fish 10 Angel Fish and stock them in the same pond. At midnight to 5am the angler will be able to get a very good or perfect Deathfish.Buydebug fishing spawners  Fishing spots can be populated with fish by using fishing spawners. Fishing spawners can be found under the buy menu when the cheat buydebug is turned on. Here is a list of fish in the game, by fishing spawner:Strange occurrences  Sometimes a Sim may bring up an old box which will give them various things. The box randomly grants the Sim one object from the following list, sorted according to the rarity of the item:Riverview  Official item\n Store itemRiverview is a free downloadable town offered from The Sims 3 store. The town was developed by Visceral Games, and is a gift for people who register their copy of The Sims 3. It was the first town made available for download, and is currently the only free downloadable town. It initially served as an incentive for players to purchase, rather than pirate, their copy of The Sims 3, as pirated versions are unable to download Riverview from TheSims3.com.Overview  Like Sunset Valley, Riverview is very large compared to previous games, although it is a small town with an idyllic countryside setting. It\u2019s dotted with farms, beautiful pastures, and nestled by a winding river, known, according the world's flavor text, as the Simomon. There are 95 lots altogether, three fewer than in Sunset Valley. The center of town is built up on an island in the middle of the Simomon. The street name where Constance Shelley and Meadow Carpenter-Rhodes live suggests that the island name is Long Island. On one of the shores of the river, there is an industrial area featuring several rabbit holes. The landscape is primarily flat, with one notable hill upon which stands Remington's Ruse, the Remington family home. The architectural style is primarily small rustic town, with a few industrial-style lots in the industrial area that contains the military base, hospital, and abandoned warehouse. Despite the small town style, there is a lot of diversity in the townscape, with farms, poor and wealthy subdivisions, and forested terrain. There are 50 new playable Sims in total. There are 22 empty residential lots for players to get started on, or they can choose any of the pre-made families. The cheapest of the lots is \u00a71200, and the most expensive is \u00a714,700. The smallest available lot is 20x30, and the largest is 64x64. The most expensive lot will put players in the company of Lessen, Shallows, Wilson, and Grisbys. There are a few old faces from The Sims 2 in Riverview, just as in Sunset Valley.Lots Community lots Families New Families Returning Families  Although not in any previous games, Riverview does feature several families that are implied to have moved to Pleasantview by the time of The Sims or The Sims 2.Homeless Sims  These Sims are pre-made, but homeless when Riverview is first loaded.Trivia Trait (The Sims 3)  Traits are the building blocks of a personality assigned to Sims in The Sims 3, replacing the previous system of personality points. The traits also appear in The Sims Medieval; this time, traits are adapted to the Medieval period. They determine a Sim's behaviors, abilities, and their wishes, including their Lifetime Wishes. There are 63 traits in the base game. Three traits were added with World Adventures, six with Ambitions, one with Fast Lane Stuff, two with Late Night, two with Generations, four with Pets, three with Showtime, six with Supernatural, two with Seasons, three with University Life, two with Island Paradise, and two with Into the Future. Altogether they add up to a total of 99 normal traits. Each trait is separated into one of four categories based on mental, physical, social, or lifestyle aspects of Sims' lives. For example, social traits may include dislikes children or friendly, while lifestyle traits would consist of technophobe or daredevil. Traits are used to allow Sims a greater complexity in their daily routines over the points system. The more traits a Sim has, the more complex they will be, as a Sim with more personality traits will exhibit a wider range of behaviors than a Sim with only one. Sims can attain traits in multiple ways. Ordinarily the player will assign a maximum of five traits to a young adult or older Sim in the Create a Sim screen under the \"Personality\" section. Traits can also be inherited via genetics from either parent, with babies and toddlers having two traits. If the toddler grows up well, the player will be able to choose a third trait for when the Sim becomes a child, and likewise a fourth when the Sim becomes a teen and finally a fifth trait when the Sim becomes a young adult. Furthermore, the lifetime reward \"Midlife Crisis\" allows the player to re-choose a Sim's traits. There are limitations on the traits a Sim can have. Foremost, two traits may not contradict each other, such as the good and evil traits, or the can't stand art and artistic traits. Such traits are inherently built around opposing behaviors and intrinsically preclude the occurrence of the other. In addition, Sims may be unable to obtain traits based on their age; one example being that babies are unable to have the charismatic trait or that only teens and older Sims can have the hopeless romantic trait. Traits also grant Sims different abilities or specific actions which only Sims having those traits can do. Insane Sims are able to use the command \"Talk to Self\" to boost their own social motive, while vegetarian Sims are able to cook vegetarian alternatives to meals containing meat (though in Showtime, all Sims are able to cook these meals, regardless of traits). Some traits can grant Sims special moodlets, with loner Sims enjoying their solitude or hydrophobic Sims fearing swimming in the pool. Other traits allow Sims a greater affinity for certain tasks, such as angler Sims being more adept at fishing while genius Sims tend to learn more quickly. In this respect, the customization that players can give to Sims via the trait system can make the game more or less challenging while offering a greater deal of variety than was possible with the personality point system used in the game's predecessors. Features comparable to traits in previous games in the series are Zodiac signs, interests, and personality.Learning traits  As Sims socialize with others, they may reveal their traits from certain interactions. For example, asking a Sim's career will reveal if they have workaholic or ambitious traits, or flirting with a Sim will reveal flirty or unflirty trait. Learning traits can be beneficial to Sims. If the Sim has the same trait as the other Sim, they will get a compatibility trait as well as a relationship boost. On the other hand, if they have any conflicting traits, they will get a negative relationship. Learning traits is very important for Architectural Designer profession. Learning a client's traits is important in order to satisfy their desired objects, such as placing bars for party animal clients, which will boost the scores. Aside from socializing, Sims can easily learn other Sims' traits from several methods:Hidden traits  Hidden traits are traits in The Sims 3 that cannot be seen in-game except when a Sim performs a related action autonomously or an unlocked interaction is available. Hidden traits become available to Sims in specific careers, life states, or to babies with an NPC for a parent. The child might then get the appropriate hidden traitAdditional traits  This section describes features that are only available in The Sims 3: University Life. Sims are born with two traits, and gain an additional trait on aging up from toddler to child, from child to teen, and from teen to young adult. Therefore, a fully-grown Sim has five traits. With University Life, it is possible to earn two additional traits, for a total of seven traits. The trait panel will still show only five traits, but when a Sim has more than five, a scroll bar will appear next to the traits. The two additional traits are earned by: Sims cannot earn the extra trait slots multiple times, for example, by reaching level 8 in all social groups or completing multiple majors. If the requirement to earn an additional trait slot is completed more than once, a prompt will appear that will allow reconfirmation or replacement of the additional trait.Removed traits  There are a number of traits that were removed before the game was released. Some of them might be removed because they share similar purpose with an existing trait, or might raise the ESRB rating, while some others were removed unexplained. Some removed traits have their own icons in the game files, while some are only mentioned in the old game strings.External links Premade families  Premade families and households.The Sims 3: Showtime  The Sims 3: Showtime is the sixth expansion pack for The Sims 3. The game is stardom and career themed, similar to The Sims 3: Late Night, and The Sims: Superstar expansions. It was released on March 6, 2012 in North America, March 8, 2012 in Europe, and March 9, 2012 in the United Kingdom.Description  Live the rags to riches story with your Sims while connected to your friends!

There, your Sim can perform at your friend\u2019s venue in front of your friend\u2019s Sims! You will also be able to chat with friends and post messages and screenshots on your friends\u2019 walls. Make your rise to fame!Game Features Cross Compatibility with other Expansion Packs Editions  There are four different editions of the expansion pack. They are:Pre-Release  It was first found on a Dutch retailer gaming list in Simprograms in November 11, 2011 and was officially announced in December 6, 2011.Trivia Music  This is a list of artists and their songs that were featured in Showtime:External links The Sims 2  The Sims 2, commonly referred to as TS2, is the first sequel to The Sims and the second major title in The Sims series. The Sims 2 was first released on September 14, 2004. The Sims 2 heralds sweeping changes from the original. The isometric view of The Sims is replaced by a full 3D environment. Sims experience life stages (baby, toddler, child, teen, young adult, adult, and elder) which have them age from birth to death, and their genetics can be passed on to their children. Unlike the original The Sims, where the player can spend forever raising a Sim's skills, the aging system in The Sims 2 imposes a time limit on this before the Sims die. Sims' personalities are given an overhaul, with each Sim having an aspiration, wants, and fears. The Sims 2, like its predecessor and successor games, is open-ended with few goals. Players can build and furnish homes for their Sims, in order to fulfill the Sims' motives. They can choose to focus on building their Sims' relationships and skills in order to advance through their careers or start a family. They can also focus on achieving a Sim's aspiration through the completion of wants and avoidance of fears. The Sims 2 shipped with 3 pre-made neighborhoods; Pleasantview, which is a continuation of the original The Sims storyline 25 years later; Strangetown, a desert landscape with paranormal occurrences; and Veronaville, a neighborhood based on several plays by William Shakespeare. The Sims 2 also shipped with many pre-made Sims and families, including some Sims and families that first appeared in The Sims. The Sims 2 has sold over 6 million PC copies since its release (13 million across all platforms), making it one of the best-selling PC games of all time.New Gameplay Options  The Sims 2 adds several new gameplay options that help expand the creation of Sims and the building of a neighborhood! These include:Tutorial  Players can take a tutorial that is a residential lot separate from gameplay. There are also in-game tutorials present in each of the pre-made lots to help players learn certain aspects of gameplay. This will help players become pros at this game faster, and give them a chance to know what to do when a certain problem or event comes up. However, families in the family bin tend not to have any teaching objective.Personalities  Personalities are not only based on the astrological sign of the Sim but also on the aspiration of the Sim. Aspirations along with the astrological sign of the Sim creates a variety of wants and fears. Each Sim has 5 areas of personality: Sloppy/Neat, Shy/Outgoing, Lazy/Active, Mean/Nice, and Serious/Playful. When creating a Sim, the player has 25 personality points to give out.Available Lots  The neighborhood screen is actually a save slot in which you can access your saved families. There are different kinds of lots for your Sims to visit:University Bon Voyage FreeTime Apartment Life Neighborhoods  The Sims 2 shipped with 3 pre-made neighborhoods. Seasons, Freetime, and Apartment Life are expansion packs that provide new neighborhoods. Sub-neighborhoods are provided in University, Nightlife, Open for Business, and Bon Voyage. Each neighborhood and sub-neighborhood comes with new pre-made Sims, though the ones in Downtown are all ghosts.Sims  The main aim of the game is to lead a Sim from the start of life to death. A Sim will be born when a female Sim and a male Sim try for a baby. The mother will spend 3 days pregnant before giving birth to a baby (though cheats can be used to speed up pregnancy). Players can name the new Sim. The baby will change into a toddler in 3 days, and 4 more days for the toddler to change into a child. After 8 days, the child morphs into a teenager, and will live 15 days before changing into an adult. After 29 days, the Sim will become an elder and will die, the length of the final stage depending on the aspiration bar when they age. Babies, toddlers, children, teens, and adults can be advanced to their next life stage at any time during the 24 Sim hours before they will grow up automatically. For babies, this requires using the birthday cake. Toddlers, children, teens, and adults can use the \"Grow Up\" self-interaction. If the University expansion pack is installed, teens have the option to go to college, where they will be young adults for approximately 24 days. Players will need to build up talent badges, skills and relationship with other people, so that he can be successful in their career. A player will also need to make sure a Sim is happy and well by fulfilling wants (including lifetime wants, avoiding fears, and fulfilling motives).Types of Sims  There are 3 kind of Sims in the game: Several new types of Sims are introduced in order to enhance gameplay for the user. The new Sims that are introduced give the player more gameplay options and assists with the creation of player storylines.Activities  There are several activities for Sims to engage in that will help them fulfill their wants and needs. There are also objects and interactions in the game to assist Sims with performing these activities.Social  There are several new social interactions introduced in The Sims 2. These new social interactions can create memories and can be related to certain age groups. Social interactions can come up in the Wants and Fears panel and can be dependent on the Sim's personality and aspiration. Sims with certain personalities may not want to complete certain social interactions. Influencing social interactions are introduced in the University expansion pack. A Sim is able to influence another Sim to complete a social interaction or a chore. Sims gain influence points by completing Wants and can lose influence points by completing Fears. The size of the influence bar depends on the number of friends that the Sim has. It also can grow in size with business perks from the Open for Business expansion pack. The Nightlife expansion pack introduces Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs. Teenagers and older are able to choose their turn-ons and turn-offs. These determine the chemistry that one Sims has with another in the form of lightning bolts. Sims can have up to 3 lightning bolts with another Sim. The higher the chemistry is that a Sim has with another Sim, the greater the chance for social interactions to be accepted. New turn-ons and turn-offs are introduced with the Bon Voyage expansion pack. Fury is introduced in the Nightlife expansion pack and occurs when one Sim gets angry at another. During this time relationships with the Sim who is furious are harder to build. Also, the Sim who is furious may pick a fight or vandalize the home lot of the Sim they are furious with. Reputation is introduced in the Apartment Life expansion pack. A Sim gains reputation by interacting with other Sims on community lots. Sims with higher reputations are more likely to gain perks such as free objects and job promotions.Careers  There are several careers that come with the game that require skills and a certain number of friends in order for promotion. Success in these careers unlocks career rewards and higher salaries plus bonuses. Sims also will receive chance cards. Correct answers to these chance cards will create rewards for Sims while incorrect answers could cause a Sim to lose its job. Nightlife and Apartment Life allow Sims to gain promotions through social interactions with other Sims. For a complete list of careers see Career TracksSkill Building  There are several skills that Sims can build in order to fulfill their wants and needs. Some skills are hidden while some create talent badges. Skills are added in the FreeTime, Apartment Life, Open for Business, Seasons and University expansion packs. Hobbies are introduced in The Sims 2: FreeTime. Sims can choose any hobby they want to pursue but they will have one hobby that they will be better at. Each hobby is associated with a certain skill and having high skill points in that skill can help the Sim reach hobby levels quicker. When a Sim reaches the highest hobby level, they can get \"In the Zone.\" This allows Sims to complete the hobby without needs dropping quickly. The ten hobbies are:Scenarios  There are several timed scenarios in the game that players must complete in order to fill wants and needs.Game editions and add-ons Editions Expansion packs  Eight expansion packs (EPs) were released. Expansion packs add new gameplay options as well as objects.Stuff packs  Ten stuff packs were released. Stuff packs add items to the game and usually don't add any new interactions. Holiday Party Pack and Mansion and Garden Stuff were the only two packs to add new interactions.Compilations with the original The Sims 2 game Compilations of expansion & stuff packs The Sims 2 Launcher  Starting with The Sims 2: Bon Voyage, EA included a launcher to start the game. This feature is also included in expansion packs, stuff packs, and compilations released after Bon Voyage. It will display which Expansion Packs and Stuff Packs the player has installed, and will show a large Play button. When connected to the internet, the launcher would also display news updates for The Sims 2, as well as promotional material. The news display has been discontinued due to the removal of The Sims 2 website, but the Launcher still displays promotional material for other games in the series. There is a delay between the time the Play button appears and the time this promotional pane loads, and it is possible to click the Play button before the promotional pane finishes loading. As of August 24, 2013, it is necessary to do this, or to otherwise bypass the Launcher, as some of the new promotional content has been observed to cause the Launcher to stop responding.The Sims 2 Store  The Sims 2 Store was an online store launched in July 2008 where players used real money to purchase items from expansion and stuff packs. Exclusive store items were also released for players to purchase. Money was converted to Sim points and $1 = 100 Sim points. Items ranged from 25-250 Sim points. To download the content, players needed to install The Sims 2 Store Edition and the EA Download Manager (now Origin). On March 31, 2011, EA closed The Sims 2 Store, and ended support of The Sims 2 Store Edition.Pre-release Version  During development the graphics of the game were distinctly different from the final version, with different models and lighting used. There are screenshots and videos featuring many assets that ultimately went unused, such as beehive and French braid hairstyles, as well as unreleased neighborhoods such as Riverside and Waterside. The former two were mostly used in video previews and a third neighborhood, Sedona, is included as a terrain template in the final release. Several features were intended to be included in the game but were removed before the final release, such as Weather and rain. More scenarios were planned, including power outage, grandchild, engagement and Big Boss scenarios. The user interface originally resembled the interface from SimCity 4, but was later changed to a completely different interface. Other minor elements such as hospital births, shoplifting, and breakfast in bed were also intended to be in the game but were ultimately cut. A common rumor is that an early version of The Sims 2 was destroyed in a server room fire at EA, forcing them to recreate much of the game from scratch. Although a server fire did occur, it did not affect the game's development.Cheats  Cheats can be used to enhance the gameplay experience or assist in the creation of movies and stories. To activate a cheat type CTRL + SHIFT + C to open the cheat console and then enter the cheat.Trivia External links Vampire  Vampires are a life state first introduced in The Sims 2: Nightlife, where they are both playable and non-playable creatures. Vampires returned in The Sims 3: Late Night and were further revamped in The Sims 3: Supernatural. Vampires are also reintroduced in The Sims 4: Vampires.The Sims: Makin' Magic  Vampires do not really play a role in The Sims, not even in Makin' Magic. The only character who is presumed to be an actual vampire is Vicki Vampiress, an NPC who operates the \"All Things Draconic\" cart in Magic Town. Sims cannot become vampires, but a magical adult Sim who successfully uses the \"Beauty or Beast\" charm can temporarily take on the appearance of a vampire. This is purely cosmetic, and the Sim remains a normal Sim in all respects.The Urbz: Sims in the City (handheld)  Vampires are one of the story elements in The Urbz: Sims in the City for GBA and DS. After the player's Urb washes up at the Bayou, Crawdad Clem and Bayou Boo suspect that they are a vampire, and the player must answer questions to prove that they aren't. Later, when the player's Urb has to go in the Dark Tree, a Grand Vampire appears, but the player scares them off with a glowing rod. When Bayou Boo shows the player's Urb the secret passage to return to Miniopolis, he gets captured on the way. He later appears in Mission 6, where it is revealed that he has been turned into a vampire and is chained up in the secret passage. The player then must pick the lock of the chain and speak to Mambo Loa about vampirism. She tells the player that the cure for vampirism is a heavy chocolate dish. The player then makes a\u00a0Chocolate Decadence, and feeds it to Bayou Boo, which cures his vampirism.The Sims 2: Nightlife  Vampires were introduced in\u00a0Nightlife. They have bluish-gray skin, red eyes, and fangs. The game-generated\u00a0Grand Vampire\u00a0NPCs wear Victorian-style clothing, apparently influenced by historical depictions of vampires.Becoming a Vampire  Vampirism is transmitted via the\u00a0bite neck\u00a0interaction performed by a Sim who is already a vampire, such as a\u00a0Grand Vampire, who will initially only bite Sims with whom they have a high relationship; however, once the Grand Vampire has bitten a Sim, their likelihood of biting other (playable or unplayable) Sims is increased until the lot is reloaded. Non-Grand Vampire Sims still require a high relationship in order to successfully bite another Sim. Other Sims can also Influence a vampire to bite another Sim, though it will likely be successful only if it is a Grand Vampire that is influenced to do so.Features  In addition to their characteristic coloration and dentition, vampires possess unique animations such as stalking about with an arm over their face, transforming into a bat for faster or more efficient routing, and a scowling portrait in the interaction pie menu. Vampires gain the Bleh!!!\u00a0interaction, which lowers the bladder need of target non-vampire Sim and can be used regardless of relationship. Teenage Vampires can get the undead scholarship to go to college, though the memory description will incorrectly describe the Sim as a\u00a0zombie. Vampires cease to age past adulthood and cannot die of old age or\u00a0starvation, even if their\u00a0hunger\u00a0reaches zero.  Their motives become static during the night (unless depleted by specific activities), but drop quickly during the day. A\u00a0vampire exposed to daylight will sizzle and smoke and see their needs plummet rapidly; if they are not directed indoors quickly, they will burn to ash and die. For this reason, they must sleep in a coffin or meditate during the day. Due to their nocturnal nature, they can be contacted via phone after other Sims complain of being woken up, but cannot be called between 7 AM and 6 PM; a vampire who owns a computer may be chatted with online at any time. Other creature Sims can also become vampires, and possess unique combinations of physical traits.\u00a0Alien, PlantSim, and evil-aligned witch\u00a0vampires\u00a0will have turquoise skin,\u00a0while zombie\u00a0vampires\u00a0turn dark blue.\u00a0Werewolf\u00a0vampires will retain their vampiric appearances during the day, and look like werewolves at night.\u00a0Servo\u00a0vampires gain fangs, a red eye, and a small bat tattoo on their heads.Curing Vampirism  If at any time the Sim grows tired of the vampire life, Vampirism can be cured with Vamprocillin-D, purchasable from the Matchmaker\u00a0or\u00a0brewable by\u00a0witches. Other Sims can Influence vampire Sims to drink Vamprocillin-D, provided they have the potion in their inventory (this can be accomplished by giving it to them as a gift). Once cured, the Sim will be returned to normal; they will be able to go out in the day but will lose all the perks of being a creature of the night.Wanting and Fearing Vampirism  Sims will not necessarily have wants or fears related to vampirism, but if they do, all Sims except Knowledge and Pleasure Sims will fear it. Knowledge Sims will want it, and once bitten will fear curing it. The memory of becoming a vampire is always positive, even if the Sim feared becoming one.Controlling/Avoiding Vampirism  The Grand Vampires will not appear in a neighborhood that does not have a Downtown sub-neighborhood associated with it. Vampires will not bite autonomously until a playable Sim has been turned into one. Since that requires some positive action on the part of the player, whether or not to have vampires (other than the Grand Vampires) is effectively a matter of player's choice. Jfade has a set of mods which can be used to control vampires' biting. One keeps vampires from biting NPCs. This can be useful, as once Grand Vampires start biting autonomously, they may attempt to bite Mrs. Crumplebottom, which can lead to game corruption. Another only allows them to bite on residential lots, while the third disables biting altogether.Trivia The Sims 3 The Sims 3: Late Night  While not included in the base game, vampires are included in The Sims 3: Late Night expansion pack as well as a theme pack for The Sims 3 iPhone. Without the Late Night expansion pack, using CAS, players can create a Sim with a pale skin, red eyes, and (with custom content) protruding teeth, for a vampire-looking Sim.\u00a0The Sims 3: Supernatural\u00a0unlocks the ability to create vampire Sims from\u00a0CAS, even if the player has not previously installed\u00a0The Sims 3: Late Night. Unlike The Sims 2, vampires do not die when they are exposed to sunlight. Instead, they will begin to smoke and will get a negative moodlet when they step outside during the day. If a vampire remains exposed to sunlight, it will eventually pass out and will not be able to use its abilities. Also, the player will get a message if a vampire Sim steps outside during the day. Vampires in The Sims 3: Late Night look relatively normal, although they have paler skin and shinier eyes than regular Sims. (If the player would like to make a light skin, then \"testingcheatsenabled true\" may be used. There should be an option to edit the Sim in CAS.) Players can usually pick them out in a crowd by their bright eyes, and possibly by the spiky tattoo on their neck. Sims receive this tattoo after becoming vampires, though it is possible that this tattoo could also be selected in CAS (via \"unlockoutfits\" cheat code). A regular Sim, unless he or she has the Brave or Evil traits, will get the Hunted moodlet whenever a vampire who they are not friends with is around. Once a Sim has met a vampire, the vampire will show up in that Sim's relationships panel with a red box around his or her picture. The Sim can use \"Ask to Turn\" with the vampire, whereby he or she will hold out their arm, and the vampire will bite them on their wrist. If they have a high or romantic relationship with the vampire, the vampire will bite the Sim on the neck instead. If a playable Sim is a vampire, then the player can offer to turn any Sim, but if the Sim refuses, the human Sim will get the \"Freaked Out\" moodlet. If there are too many other Sims around, or if the player's Sim doesn't have a high enough relationship level with the vampire, he or she may be rejected from receiving \"the gift.\" After the bite, he or she will have a moodlet describing a mosquito or spider bite. The Sim will then turn into a vampire after 2\u20133 days. Although vampires can travel, a transforming Sim who is trying to board a plane will be noticed by the flight attendant due to the blemish and will be refused by security. If the Moodlet Manager is used on the human with the moodlet, the Sim will become a vampire. Vampirism can be cured by buying a cure from the science lab, which costs 3000 simoleons. After being cured, the vampire will lose its vampire form and powers and will become a normal Sim. Vampires can also have children that will be born with Vampirism. These vampire children can also be cured. Vampires grow up as normal Sims do, but age five times slower than normal once they reach adulthood.The Sims 3: Supernatural  Vampires are improved upon in The Sims 3: Supernatural. When this expansion pack is installed, the Vampire life state will be available whether or not The Sims 3: Late Night is installed. Vampires in Supernatural are essentially the same as the ones in Late Night, but with added features, customization, and social interactions. Unlike in Late Night, they can be created in CAS, and become immune to the sunlight by using the Vampiric Sunscreen elixir. Vampires can become immortal if they get the Immortal lifetime reward. Certain elixirs can either cause vampirism or cure it. With\u00a0Supernatural\u00a0installed, vampire features and abilities are enhanced. More interactions are included, such as hypnotic gaze, intimidate, show off teeth, talk about the joy of plasma, and so on. They can also confess or deny their state as a vampire to Sims who are exploiting their weaknesses and accusing them as vampires.\u00a0 Other features implemented in The Sims 3: Supernatural are Plasma Juice and Plasma Orange Juice, as seen in Late Night. The juices are basically blood in a juice box and can be accessed from the fridge by a vampire Sim. Plasma fruit can be obtained by raiding a grocery store (with a chance of getting arrested), or growing it by planting the fruit or the glowing unknown rare seed. If a vampire Sim has the Vegetarian trait, they will need to live off of these Plasma Products, and if they drink from another Sim they will suffer the same consequences as a Vegetarian human Sim eating meat.The Sims 4: Vampires  The Sims 4: Vampires introduces the vampire life state with a whole bunch of new supernatural powers and abilities. Vampires can alter their appearance between their regular and dark forms, and can use supernatural abilities including super speed, turning into a bat, super strength, etc... Vampires can replenish their thirst need, which replaces hunger, by drinking from another Sim (either willfully or by mind-controlling them), consuming a plasma fruit or a plasma pack, or eating a plasma fruit salad after discovering the recipe. Vampires must also stay out of the sunlight during daylight hours, though the severity of the effects that sunlight has on a vampire is based on the rank of the vampire and their perks.Becoming a vampire Create a Sim  Like aliens in The Sims 4: Get to Work, vampires can be made straight from Create a Sim and have their own special CAS options, such as having an alternative \"dark\" form, editing their eyes to be unnatural eye colors, pale skin tones, different fang types, veins and etc.Turned  Sims can ask vampires to be turned. If they comply, the vampire will bite the Sim and then offer them their blood which the Sim will drink. However, a player controlled vampire can also turn other Sims without request. Sims will not immediately transform, but will get the \"Strangely Hungry\" moodlet which causes their hunger need to drain. This moodlet lasts about 12 hours. Once the moodlet expires, Sims will get a second moodlet, named \"Disgusted by Food\", which lasts another 12 hours. Once that moodlet expires, a third moodlet is added, called \"Appetite Lost\". Once this moodlet is added, Sims will be unable to gain other food-related moodlets (except Nauseous) until the transformation is complete. Once this moodlet expires the Sim is finally transformed into a creature of the dark, gaining a Tense moodlet, named \"Thirsty\", for the first 24 hours of his/her vampirism. When a vampire turns a human Sim, they become a master, and the human turned vampire becomes their vampire offspring. Turning Sims into vampires is only possible if the \"Vampire Creation\" perk has been purchased.Vampires Powers  Vampires will have their own panel to gain and upgrade new abilities that make them more powerful. New powers include mind control, shape-shifting into a bat, faster transportation, increased strength, reduced needs, and more.Weaknesses  Vampires all start out with weaknesses, most that can be overcome by purchasing perks in the Vampire Powers menu. Vampires start off with these basic weaknesses: Vampires can purchase garlic immunity, the three tiers of sun resistance, and/or the tamed thirst perks which can counteract these basic weaknesses. Vampires may also concoct a sunlight reversal cocktail with high vampire lore skill, which effectively reverses their weakness to sunlight. Instead of draining their vampiric energy while out in the sun, this cocktail causes them to gain vampiric energy when exposed to the sun's rays.\u00a0 If the The Sims 4: Seasons\u00a0is installed, vampires may go out during the day during cloudy weather, as well as blizzards and thunderstorms unharmed.\u00a0 Umbrellas may also be carried to protect from the harmful rays of the sun during the day.\u00a0Additionally, vampires are immune to most side effects of the temperature system, including freezing to death and overheating.\u00a0 There are more weaknesses that have to be taken in order to grow as a vampire, such as sloppy drinking, further weakness to sunlight, uncontrollable hissing, unable to eat normal food, guilt from feeding on a Sim without their permission, reduced power gain while sleeping, etc...Dark Form  Just like aliens from The Sims 4: Get to Work, vampires have a sim form and an alternative form in which they can switch between to keep their vampiric presence from being revealed. Vampires will switch into their \"Dark Form\" to turn into their true vampiric nature and access some of their supernatural powers, such as feeding and turning other sims. The Dark Form can be fully customized separately from the normal form in CAS. Sims who have been turned will be assigned a randomly generated Dark Form, which can be changed, or removed via any mirror. \"Dark Form\" is totally optional, and the Player will not be penalized for not using it. Both forms have the exact same customization options, and Vampires without a Dark Form will have access to the same abilities as Vampires with Dark Forms.Vampire Needs  Vampires have different needs to normal Sims. Vampires do not need to cater to a bladder meter and their energy need is elongated and replaced with \"Vampire Energy\" as well as the hunger need being replaced with a \"Thirst\" need for plasma. The needs panel also showcases the experience to achieve the next vampire rank and the power points. Vampires who don't replenish their thirst will attack random Sims and feed from them if it's low enough. Vampires who low Vampire Energy while they're out in the sunlight will die of sunlight exposure and burst into flames. Vampires can also replenish their Vampire Energy through the typical sleeping through a bed, sleeping in a coffin, or dark meditation. See the page on Vampire powers for more information.Interactions  Vampires have special interactions which are all marked by a bat symbol in the interaction. Vampires can also use their powers on other Sims even if they are also a vampire.Interactions to other Vampires  Vampires can interact with others like them by showing off their powers, sparring, and vampire training. Sparring enacts a battle between two vampires as a test of strength. Vampires can enact in a friendly version of sparring where as enemies can fight each other, damaging their relationship further. Vampires can also slay each other if their relationship is low enough. If the vampire that started the fight has a Ultimate Vampire Cure in their inventory, they will throw it in the losing vampire's face, curing them of their vampirism. If the fight was unsuccessful then the Ultimate Vampire Cure is not used.Vampire Offspring  When vampires turn Sims, that Sim once turned will become the vampire's offspring, as seen in the relationships panel. Vampire's offspring and their master can interact with each other just like any other Sim except the master's powers will work more efficiently on them, with the \"I am the Master\" aspiration reward trait from the \"Vampire Family\" aspiration, vampire master's can make their offspring's be under an irresistible command.Curing Vampirism  Vampirism can be cured by obtaining a glass of \"Ultimate Vampire Cure\" which is a concoction that can be made at a bar by Sims with a maxed out Vampire lore skill (level 15). Once made, Vampires can voluntarily take it and cure themselves, or other Sims can use the \"Slay Vampire\" interaction with a cure in their inventory and once they win the battle the Sim will throw the cure into the vampire's face and cure them, this can be done by other vampires as well.Trivia External links References Grim Reaper  The Grim Reaper is an NPC who appears in The Sims: Livin' Large, The Sims 2, The Sims 3, The Sims 4 and The Sims Medieval. He also appears in The Sims FreePlay as part of the \"Life Dreams\" update. He spawns on the lot when a Sim dies, performing various animations in front of the dying Sim before spawning an urn or a tombstone.Biography Appearance in The Sims: Livin' Large  In addition to his appearance when a Sim dies, he will also appear and ring the doorbell if there are more than five Jack-O-Lanterns on the lot, a reference to trick-or-treating. There is a suggested malevolence about him, as can be seen from the results when Sims plead with him. Bonehilda is a huge fan of Grim Reaper, and will try to get an autograph from him when he's present while she's out of her closet. When the Grim Reaper appears, he will move over to the dead Sim and wave his scythe, and any adult Sim can plea with the Grim Reaper and attempt to save the Sim's life. If the Grim Reaper is in a bad mood, the Sim will die regardless. If the Grim Reaper is in a good mood, however, he will challenge the pleading Sim to a game of rock, paper, scissors \u2014 if the pleading Sim loses, the dead Sim will be resurrected as a zombie; if they win, however, the Sim will be fully resurrected.Appearance in The Sims 2  In The Sims 2, the Reaper's appearance is different from that in other games: he is grey and wraithlike rather than skeletal and black. Olive Specter has memories of WooHoo with him and giving birth to Nervous Subject shortly after, though this is impossible in normal gameplay. Through use of cheats a biography of him can be seen containing some tongue-in-cheek information. With the University expansion pack he can be bribed to resurrect dead Sims with the Resurrect-O-Nomitron, which is the career reward for the Paranormal career track. (The question of why he might want or need money is left to the imagination.) If the last Sim on the lot dies, one of a variety of sardonic messages will appear. On occasion, he will interact with one of the items in the house before leaving. So far, he has only been known to get a blended drink from a minibar, watch television, relax on a bed, use the toilet, and/or play on the computer. When a Sim dies of starvation, fright or by disease, they stand up, wave their hand (if dying by starvation), collapse on their knees and then lie down to a conformable position. The Grim Reaper walks towards the dead body and turns them into a grave. When Sims die of old age, there are two life endings they can get, based on their aspiration. If they have any aspiration level from failure to green, the Grim Reaper will come with a black trail of smoke, and hold up an empty hourglass, meaning that the Sim has no more time to live. The Sim will then try to grab the hourglass out of Death's hand and try to flip it back over. The Grim Reaper then snatches it back, and angrily points in a direction. The Sim walks there, and an urn or grave (plain grey) is created. If the dying Sim is in gold or platinum aspiration, Death will come wearing a pink Hawaiian lei, and will have a white smoke trail. Two Hula Zombies will appear in the room, and relaxing Hawaiian music will play. Death will slowly point at the dying Sim in a non-angry way, and the Sim will back up, and act shy. Death will then hold his arms out as if to hug the Sim, then will give him or her a tiki glass with a lemon on the side. Then Death will pack the Sim's bags, and the Sim, still being timid, will smile and slowly head off to the afterlife. If the Sim was in platinum aspiration, their urn or grave will be gold and white, and will show the symbol for their aspiration. In general, when two Sims in a household are scheduled to die on the same day, the Grim Reaper will first come for one, and will come back later for the other. However, if both members of a married or joined couple are scheduled to die on the same day, he may take both at once.The Sims 2 (console)  In this version the Grim Reaper only appears when a Sim has died. Sims cannot plead with him to save their loved ones. He can be only interacted with by ghost Sims. The Sim has an option to challenge him by playing the violin (if the Sim has a high creativity, charisma and logic skill and has died in a Platinum mood, he/she has higher chances of winning) or pay him \u00a7100 to return to life. In either cases, the Sim will be resurrected and the Grim Reaper will burn and disappear.The Sims 2 (Nintendo DS)  In The Sims 2 for Nintendo DS, the Grim Reaper's appearance is completely different to his usual black robes and scythe. Instead, he wears what appears to be a large brown coat and large brown hat he looks a bit like a creepy ghostly cowboy. It can also be seen that he has yellow eyes. Also, instead of the scythe, he uses a sack to \"collect\" the dead Sims. Concept art of him can be unlocked throughout the progress of the game.Appearance in The Sims 3  The Reaper of The Sims 3 has little backstory, and never appears outside of death sequences unless moved in before patch or the player owns The Door Of Life And Death (The Sims Store). There is a statue of him in Pleasant Rest Graveyard in Sunset Valley. His skin tone is midnight black, and wears a black hooded robe. He has a very deep voice, but if moved in he will have voice 1 at an average pitch. The reason for this is unexplained. In this game, a Sim can no longer plead for a deceased Sim's life, but after a certain patch they will need to play chess with him and win.Appearance in The Sims Medieval  The Grim Reaper's entire appearance is changed to fit the \"Medieval\" theme, such as changing his outfit from the color black to red, giving him small wings, giving him purple hands with long nails instead of the bony ones and re-doing his scythe. When the Reaper appears, he will make the dead Sim's spirit fly into the air. Then, he will disappear by going under the earth, taking the corpse Sim with him. In this game he cannot be pleaded for a Sim's life.Appearance in The Sims 4  In The Sims 4, the Grim Reaper has a slightly different physical appearance compared to the previous series. The Grim Reaper wears a black, modern cloak, instead of a torn-down cloak. When reaping the souls, the Grim Reaper no longer has the death list on a piece of paper. Instead, he'll use a tablet where he keeps the death list.Gameplay mechanics The Sims: Livin' Large  The Grim Reaper will appear in a cloud of skulls next to the mailbox, then walk over to the dying Sim and spend a short amount of time waving his scythe. If the path to the dying Sim is blocked, he will teleport there instead. During this time another Sim may be directed to approach and plead with him. This option is not available for children. There is around a 50% chance of him accepting the plea, at which point he will play a game of rock-paper-scissors with the pleader. If the Sim loses there is still a 50% chance of him bringing the deceased back to life as a zombie, with their skin colored green and their personality wiped. Usually, the Grim Reaper will be in a bad mood and turn down the plea, and the Sim will die, but will come back as a ghost, being see-through and greenish-blue and walk around \"spooking\" Sims and making windy ghost noises. If Livin' Large is not installed, the Grim Reaper will not appear; instead, the dying Sim will spawn a tombstone automatically.The Sims 2  The Grim Reaper can be pleaded with as in Livin' Large; however, the chance of success is directly linked to the relationship score of the pleader to the deceased: if the total of the daily and lifetime relationship is below 25, the plea is guaranteed to fail. If it is above that level, the percentage chance of the plea succeeding is equal to that same number, which is capped at 90. If the plea succeeds, the Sim is \"Saved From Death\", which is frequently a major want for Knowledge Sims. If the death is from old age, the plea interaction will be unavailable. Sims must be able to reach the Grim Reaper to plead with him; if a Sim drowns too far from the edge of a pool, this interaction will not be available. In University, the Resurrect-O-Nomitron reward from the Paranormal career enables Sims to call the Reaper and pay him to bring back Sims who they have a relationship with. The precise results depend on the payment: In The Sims 2: FreeTime, Sims may ask the genie to give them the power to cheat death. This enables them to plead for their own life with a 100% chance of success the first time, which decreases by 10% with each subsequent attempt. Sims who die of old age will only get an extra day. In The Sims 2: Apartment Life, good witches with Level 9 magic skill and the correct ingredients can cast the Expello Mortis spell to banish the Grim Reaper, saving a dying Sim. Also, an evil witch with 9 Magic skill points and correct ingredients can cast the Vivificus Zombiae spell at the tombstone or urn of a Sim, and the Sim will return as a zombie.The Sims Life Stories  In The Sims Life Stories, if a Sim successfully saves a Sim from the Grim Reaper, a message from the Grim Reaper will appear at the top right of the screen saying \"You intrigue me mortal, I am going to hang out here for awhile to find out how you beat me.\" The Sim who defeated the Grim Reaper will then greet the Grim Reaper, and then the Grim Reaper will stay at the Sim's house for a while and play chess.The Sims 2 (console)  All Sims that die will be reborn as ghosts where they can find the Grim Reaper standing at the front of the lot where they can challenge him to a fiddle contest. Sims that have a higher creativity skill and have died when in Platinum mood have a higher chance of winning. If the Sim wins then the Grim Reaper will disappear. As a ghost, the Sim is more likely to have the aspiration goals of: If the player wishes not to choose the fiddle challenge or simply gives up, they can pay a fee of \u00a7100 to return to life.The Sims 3  The Grim Reaper appears when a Sim or pet dies. However unlike the previous games, the Grim Reaper will literally \"reap\" the spirit of the Sim to turn it into a ghost, while the remaining Sims around the household or lot will mourn for him/her. The appearance of this ghost is determined by the way the Sim has died. Unlike previous games, a Sim can no longer plea for the dead Sim's life. However, if a Sim in the household owns a chessboard they may play chess against him to resurrect the dying Sim after a certain patch. The Grim Reaper may have 3-6 logic skill points and 3-6 hidden chess skill points. If the deceased Sim has a death flower in their inventory, then they will automatically give it to the Grim Reaper shortly after becoming a ghost and their lives will be spared in exchange for the flower. The Grim Reaper will also refuse to take Sims with the unlucky trait who die accidentally, because (according to him) their lives provide too much amusement for himself. With The Sims 3: Pets, pets can harass the Grim Reaper and save their master. The pet has to be at least best friends with the Sim to do this. There is a 35% chance pets will harass the Grim Reaper, and an additional +10% chance if they have aggressive, loyal, or brave traits; or -10% if they have clueless, lazy, nervous, or skittish traits. A pet cannot save the same Sim from death more than once. There is a 20% chance that he will stay for a short period of time after he's done with his job, and an additional +5% for each Sim that dies on the lot. The maximum chance is 75%. During this time, Sims may hang out and socialize with the Grim Reaper. The Grim Reaper will behave as if he were a guest; such as watching TV or using toilet. He will not hang around if the Sim dies in a diving area, however. If a Sim dies from vending machine, the Grim Reaper may attempt to buy a soda from the vending machine and drink from it. The soda will pass through his body and leave a puddle on the ground which will remain after he leaves.The Sims Medieval  The Grim Reaper has a totally different appearance in this stand-alone. The Grim Reaper, like in every game, comes to collect the souls of the deceased Sims. However, he doesn't stay around, like he usually does in The Sims 3 and can't be made playable without the use of cheats. His appearance also appears to be very medieval, sporting bright colors along the robes, a golden belt, and bright red caps. A promotional picture seen to the right depicts a new Grim Reaper with a red robe, long white hair, black wings, a different scythe, and a belt with a skull and hourglass on it. It is possible that it is the same Grim just dressing to fit the medieval theme of that era, or that he is the ancestor of all of the other Grim Reapers in the series.The Sims 4  When a Sim dies, the Grim Reaper will appear from a cloud of smoke. He will walk towards the Sim who has died; upon confronting the dead he will consult his tablet, and then proceed to reap the soul out of the Sim and replace the body with an urn or gravestone. Any living Sims on the lot can attempt to plead with the Grim Reaper in which there is a 33% chance of the Grim Reaper bringing the Sim back to life, or downright rejecting the plea. After the Grim Reaper is finished, there is a chance he may stick around on the lot, in which other Sims can perform social interactions on him. However, romantic interactions generally will not go very far. The Grim Reaper gives unique answers when asked about career or if single.Hints and tips The Sims 2 Grimwear  Players can dress a Sim as the Grim Reaper by using cheats. While in the neighborhood, bring up the cheat box (press Ctrl+Shift+C) and type \"boolProp testingcheatsenabled true\" without quotes. Then go to Create-A-Sim mode and press Shift+N. This will activate CAS Debugging Mode (a message says so in the top right corner of the screen). Press Shift+M to remove CAS Debug Mode. The Grim Reaper suit should be at the end of \"everyday clothing\" in outfits. The player can even make them in the \"Hula Zombie\" outfit that appears when a Sim dies of old age with a high aspiration bar.Strange genetics  Using the Tombstone of Life and Death, Sims can become pregnant by Grim Reaper. The strange thing is that the child will often have light skin, light blue eyes, black hair and the 2nd face in CAS. It is even stranger in the case of Nervous Subject, who has strange genetics. Some players believe that Nervous is not even the Grim Reaper's son, because his genetics are much different than Grim's.The Sims 3 Move in  It is possible to \"Move In\" the Grim Reaper into the active household without the use of any cheats or tools. What one needs is to build a relationship high enough with Grim Reaper when he lingers on the lot (this does not happen often, he will put away his scythe and stop levitating) and ask him to move in. It's good to have the Legendary Host lifetime reward. He cannot be married, and must be moved in. Having the charismatic trait, maxed charisma, charisma challenges completed or the Never Dull lifetime reward can be very helpful here, as he disappears from the relationship panel when he leaves. Having an unlucky or loser traits makes summoning him repeatedly much easier, otherwise the player will only have one chance. Take note that once he is moved in he will disappear, this can be fixed by typing \"Testingcheatsenabled true\" and then shift-clicking the ground and clicking \"Teleport Me Here.\" Also, he will have Voice 1, with an average pitch; this is due to him being generated by the game and treated like a new townie. A player can only use cheats to change his voice to the more appropriate deep voice of Male 3 set to the lowest pitch. The other way to get the Grim Reaper to move in is to first press Ctrl-Shift-C and type in testingcheatsenabled true then, with any Sim, hold shift and click your Mailbox, click \"Make Me Know Everyone\" then go to your Relationship List: keep scrolling until you see the Grim Reaper's face/hood (He shouldn't have the name Grim Reaper though) click on it and select \"Invite Over\" and wait till the Grim Reaper comes. When he does hold shift and click on him, select \"Add Sim to Current Household\" and you should have the Grim Reaper in your Family. You can go to City Hall and change his name to Grim Reaper if you like to. If you use plan outfit/makeover on this Grim Reaper he will just turn into a random black Sim. You can give him traits with shift, click \"Change Traits\". He is no longer a real Grim Reaper so a different real Grim Reaper will still show up. If The Sims 3: Late Night or later is installed, the Grim Reaper can no longer be moved in.Sim/Grim Reaper hybrids  It is possible in games patched below version 1.3 to try for a baby with the Grim Reaper without him being a family member: after patch 1.3 the Grim Reaper must be a family member for such relations to be possible. Hybrids in The Sims 3 can have totally black skin due to the Grim Reaper's unique genetics. The Grim Reaper can be added to the household by having a high relationship with him and asking him to move in. With testing cheats, the players can drag the Sim's relationship with the Grim Reaper to maximum instantly. After that, Sims can try to seduce the Grim Reaper until trying for baby interaction is available. With the Door of Life and Death premium content from TheSims3.com, it is possible to summon a Grim Reaper, build up a relationship with him, and then try for baby with him. However, the Grim Reaper from the door is just a regular generated Sim, disguised with the Grim Reaper outfit. Trying for baby with them does not make the Sim's offspring a Grim Reaper hybrid.How to get a Grim Reaper statue for a residential lot  There is a statue of Grim Reaper in the neighborhood graveyard like one on the Sunset Valley Cemetery. The player must send a Sim with a kleptomaniac trait to the cemetery and tell him/her near the statue to steal. Back at the household, the player may not want a stolen statue standing around, so it may be placed and then copied via the build menu. Then the original statue may be sent back to the cemetery.The Sims Medieval Move in  The Grim Reaper can be moved into a household to get permanent control of him by enabling testingcheatsenabled, shift-clicking on him, and then making him a spouse of the currently selected Sim. His hunger and energy motives will not deplete, and will be treated as a villager that does not fight. He will usually possess the evil or morose traits; his second trait will usually be randomized.The Sims 4 Move in  The Grim Reaper can be moved into a household via testingcheatsenabled. Simply enable the cheat, shift+click on the Grim Reaper before he leaves, and click \"Add to Family\"; this will allow the player to control him. When controllable, players are able to build up his romance bar, as he will be treated like a regular Sim. It is not possible to try for a baby with him. The Grim Reaper can't do some basic actions like sleeping, and instead of walking he will \"hover\" towards his destination. All of his needs except social and fun do not decay, so he does not need to sleep, wash, eat or use the toilet. If a Sim dies after the Grim Reaper is added to a household using testingcheatsenabled, an additional Grim Reaper will be spawned to reap their soul. The new Grim Reaper can also be added to the household, and this process can be repeated to create a household with up to 8 Grim Reapers. Each Grim Reaper will have at least one trait and a random aspiration. In The Sims 4, unlike in other Sims games, adding the Grim Reaper to a household will not cause any issues in the game.Trivia The Sims The Sims 2 The Sims 3 The Sims 4 Twinbrook  Twinbrook is a world which shipped with The Sims 3: Ambitions. It is most likely named after the twin rivers that flow on either side of the richer part of the town, near households such as the Whelohffs.Overview  Grant Rodiek first mentioned Twinbrook in an interview, saying; \"The town of Twinbrook is absolutely beautiful and designed specifically for players. You will clearly see how our world-designing team has improved when you discover Twinbrook.\" Twinbrook stresses the new professions and skills introduced in Ambitions, such as the Stylist profession or Inventing skill. Twinbrook is situated on a bayou (swamp), with many bridges and may be in the state of Simisouri (according to DeAndre Wolf's bio). Much of the town is designed in a French style like many bayou towns. For example, the town library is a classic French design with two porticos, one at both entrances. According to a GameSpot hands-on, Twinbrook 'is a fictitious bayou town not unlike a backwoods suburb of Louisiana.' Players who attended the UK hands on event reported that Twinbrook is 'a huge new town, which had been flooded, and is now half-swamp half-town. The swampy areas are very dank and misty. The other side of Twinbrook has brand new shops such as the laundromat, the tattoo parlor and stylist shop and much more. I really enjoyed having a look around Twinbrook, and the place looks really great. They've also re-done most of the rabbit holes, such as the diner.' It may be assumed that Simslaus Creek references Stanislaus County, a county located in California, or the Stanislaus River located in said county. Interestingly, all the pre-made deceased Sims in Twinbrook are pale green if resurrected. They also have gray hair, are all barefoot, and most (if not all) like the color grey. In this post on thesims3.com, SimGuruLily says that this was intentional, but does not say what the intent was. It is very possible that this is a reference to classic comic book supervillain Solomon Grundy, who was resurrected after being \"buried\" in a swamp, emerging as a green-skinned, white-haired, bare-footed demi-zombie. The town appears to have a larger population of rich Sims than Sunset Valley or Riverview has. These families include the Whelohffs, Pidgins, Knacks, and the Bakers. Additionally, several of the houses belonging to the rich are larger than the Sunset Valley and Riverview wealthy families; most families in Twinbrook start with \u00a75,000 or \u00a710,000 in cash, while in the other worlds almost all families start with around \u00a71000 in cash. Therefore, Twinbrook is, by far, the most wealthy (non-store) world in the game after Bridgeport. Twinbrook is technically an island. This fact is hard to discover, but in gameplay, upon visiting map view and pressing tab, you are able to view a wider range of the town. Unusually, if you follow the river near the Rackets' house, there seem to be buildings which look like skyscrapers. Some people think it is a reference to Bridgeport. The only other worlds which have this are Champs Les Sims, Bridgeport and Sims University.Lots Community Lots Families New families Returning families Homeless Sims  These Sims are premade, but homeless when Twinbrook is first loaded.Notes Trivia References ", "Crimson Skies Wiki": "Crimson Skies Wiki Aircraft  This category contains articles and media relating to the aircraft of the Crimson Skies universe.Crimson Skies Wiki Featured article  The Fairchild F611 Brigand is fast, has surprising agility, and impressive armament.

Or possibly the sequel, Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge. Crimson Skies is a arcade flight video game published in 2000 by Microsoft Game Studios, it was developed by Zipper Interactive. Since it is an arcade flight game, it is \"not about simulating reality-it's about fulfilling fantasies,\" as stated by the series creator, Jordan Weisman.Appearances Story  In 1937, Nathan Zachary and the Fortune Hunters were recovering from the foul betrayal of Lucas Miles in the skies over Cuba by hunting for the lost treasure of Sir Francis Drake. Locating Drake's Gold, the Fortune Hunters find evidence of British interest in Hawaii, and are set upon by the Medusas. While victorious, the Fortune Hunters are curious as to the reason for the British presence. Seizing a British Balmoral leads them to a secret British base, which they promptly destroy. Fighting off a counterattacks from HMS Barracuda, the Fortune Hunters are able to make repairs to the Pandora using the British facilities and recovered Drake's Gold, despite last-minute interference from the Royal Air Force. Rejoicing in their newfound wealth, the Fortune Hunters cancel their party when they receive a distress call from an old friend - Ilsa Fassenbiender, daughter of Doctor Wilhelm Fassenbiender, radios the Fortune Hunters with news that her father has been kidnapped by the Soviet secret police, while she herself is kept prisoner by Boeing Aviation in Pacifica. The Fortune Hunters launched an assault on the CCCP zeppelin Workers' Voyage to retrieve the doctor, which resulted in Nathan Zachary once again encountering his old flame, the Black Swan. Successful in their flying rescue, the Fortune Hunters attempt to repeat their success with a lightning raid on the Boeing plant, hoping to both rescue Ilsa and steal the prototype Hughes Bloodhawk, Blue Streak. Again successful, the Fortune Hunters are forced to strike agains the USSR once again - this time attacking a petrol tanker off the coast of Pacifica to refuel the Pandora. Returning to Pacifica, the Fortune Hunters attack a zeppelin belonging to Blake Aviation Security in a pre-emptive strike which is an unmigitigated success. Shortly after this victory, the Fortune Hunters found themselves battling a new enemy. The previously unknown pirate gang, the Black Hats, had shot down the Workers' Voyage, an act that might not have been possible had the Fortune Hunters not destroyed its escorts. Consumed with guilt, the Fortune Hunters descended upon the wreckage, driving off the Black Hats and ensuring the survival of the hospital ship sent in to rescue survivors. Flush with victory and with two of the most brilliant aircraft designers in the world in tow, the Fortune Hunters head south, for the Nation of Hollywood. Although their original intention was merely to rescue a movie starlet trapped by her contract, the Fortune Hunters followed another successful rescue with the theft of the world's largest airplane and participating in the first Johnson Cup Race, which Nathan Zachary won by a considerable margin. This victory, on Johnny Johnson's home turf, drove him to attempt a nefarious plan to destroy Zachary. When that failed, he used the delay caused by the race to send a Hughes Aviation combat zeppelin to destroy the Fortune Hunters' Pandora. While the assault resulted in the destruction of the Hughes Aviation zeppelin, the Pandora was badly damaged. Fleeing inland, the Fortune Hunters were forced to hijack the cargo zeppelin Figaro to provide the Pandora with a tow. Arriving in Sky Haven, the Fortune Hunters encountered Black Swan and her group. With both sides willing to let bygones be bygones, the party went late into the night. The next morning, however, Zachary awoke to find his crew missing, and his only ally the Black Swan, whose crew had also mysteriously disappeared. Hunting the area around Sky Haven, Zachary picked up a transmission from Sparks, the Pandora's pilot. He was aboard the Rocky Express. Zachary hastened to rescue his pilot, but the Express was attacked by Black Hats. The Express was escorted by Hellhounds from Sacred Trust Incorporated... who were expecting the Black Hats. Zachary and the Black Swan drove off both the pirates and the supposed security, disabled the Express' defences, and scooped up Sparks seconds before the Express' locomotive exploded. Convinced the Black Hats are responsible for the disappearance of their crews, Zachary and the Black Swan determine to hunt down a member of the Black Hats leadership... Ulysses Boothe. Finding Boothe, Zachary was able to shoot him down and capture him, and proposed to trade him back to the Hats in exchange for the return of the crews. Furious, but without options, Boothe agreed. Zachary dropped Boothe at the agreed-upon location, only to be told that the crews were being held inside a cargo zeppelin which had been wired with explosives. With consummate skill, Zachary was able to shoot free the zeppelin, board it, and release the crews. While the crews escaped, Black Swan herself was shot down and captured on the ground. Together, the Fortune Hunters and the Black Swans proceeded to decimate the Black Hats' operations in Sky Haven, culminating in the utter destruction of their mountaintop base, the theft of dozens of aerial torpedoes and the rescue of the Black Swan. Realising there had to be a secret alliance between the Black Hats and Sacred Trust, Zachary was forced to approach the one man who might be able to help them... Paladin Blake. While initially distrustful, Zachary was able to convince Blake of his sincerity and recruit him to assist the Fortune Hunters in their efforts to exterminate both the Black Hats and Sacred Trust. Heading for the Sacred Trust HQ in Manhattan, Zachary contacted an old friend of his, who lead him to an Sacred Trust warehouse crammed with illegal merchandise, which was being loaded onto a German freighter. Destroying the warehouse and the freighter, Zachary was able to draw official attention to the activities of Sacred Trust. However, the Fortune Hunters needed more evidence. Evidence such as that known by Waldo Carney, Sacred Trust's accountant, who was trying to flee the city. When his zeppelin was attacked by Black Hats, the Fortune Hunters were able to rescue him and transport him safely to police HQ. Convinced their secrets had been revealed, Sacred Trust attempted to flee the city, loading their remaining contraband and documents onto zeppelins. However, the Fortune Hunts and Blake Aviation Security were able to disable their zeppelins, as well as the stolen Spruce Goose, and prevent Sacred Trust from removing the vital evidence. Furious at these repeated defeats, the true master behind both the Black Hats and Sacred Trust revealed himself - Lucas Miles, the man who had betrayed the Fortune Hunters in Cuba. In his mighty zeppelin Dante, Miles attempted to flee, but his zeppelin and his fighters were no match for the combined force of the Fortune Hunters and Blake Aviation Security. The Dante was shot down, and Miles was killed. Victorious once again, the Fortune Hunters accepted a substantial reward from the government of the Empire State, and decided to take a tropical break to spend it. Sea Haven is always nice this time of the year...Gameplay  Crimson Skies has a number of features to its gameplay that do not appear anywhere else in the series. Most notable among these are Stunts and the level of aircraft customization.Sequel  Crimson Skies was followed by an Xbox-exclusive sequel, Crimson Skies: High Road to RevengeExternal Links Hughes P21-J Devastator  The Hughes Aviation P21-JMK11 Devastator outperformed every combat aircraft in speed, armament, and maneuverability, when it was first released. Although it is now dated, it is still used as a fighter-bomber, where its lack of speed can be overcome by its agility and firepower.Versions  The original Mk I Devastator was a concept model, created by Hughes Aviation, to demontrate the effectiveness of the pusher configuration as applied to combat aircraft. Although lightly armored, the Mk I was a smash success with several key demographics, including state militias.Mark II  The Mark II Devastator was a considerable improvement over the Mk I. Key changes included: the change to a significantly more powerful engine, the Allison V-series which would be later used in the Hughes Bloodhawk; the addition of a second pair of linked machine guns; the addition of a fuselage-mounted magnetic missile launcher and the addition of a landing hook, making the Mk II a zeppelin-capable fighter. These changes made the Mk II the premier zeppelin-escort fighter of the day, and the model was priced accordingly. Mechanics were pleased to discover that the Mk II was much more upgrade-friendly than the sometimes tempermental Mk I. Typical upgrades included adding a supercharger to the engine to increase straight-line speed, fitting a third pair of machine guns to the wings and extending the capacity of the missile magazine.Mk III  In 1936, Hughes Aviation released the Mk III Devastator, widely considered an effective fighter but significantly weaker than its predecessor. In a effort to reduce the eye-watering list price of the Mk II, the Mk III was supplied with the Tornado G450 engine, which did not have the nitro-thrust capacity of the Mk II. In order to counter the reduced power, the twin three-bladed counter-rotating propellors of the Mk II were replaced by a single four-bladed propellor. This, in turn, reduces the amounts of force the engine has to exert, but the downside is that removing the counter-rotating props gives the airframe alot more torque to handle, which then contributes to bad maneuverability. The Mk III also had the magnetic missile launcher removed in favour of standard underwing hardpoints. However, reinforced wing struts allowed a fourth set of guns to be fitted, creating one of the most heavily-armed interceptor-fighters of its day. While the Mk III was considerably cheaper to purchase and maintain than the Mk II, the Mk II was much more popular, especially among pirate gangs. The Fortune Hunters, long-time fans of the Devastator line, initially deployed in Mk III Devastators, but were able to replace these with classic Mk II models sometime in early 1938.Trivia  The Devastator bears some resemblance to the Curtiss-Wright XP-55 Ascender prototype fighter: namely, the pusher engine, canards and vertical stabilisers placed on the wings.Export  While the majority of aircraft production in North America is for what is anachronistically referred to as \"domestic\" use, Hughes Aviation followed a different route with the Devastator, making it available internationally. However, the extortionate export duties applied at the order of Hughes himself meant that there was very little interest from his intended customer, the British Empire. However, Hughes was contacted, and eventually supplied hundreds of Devastators to, the USSR. Indeed, the only Hughes plant outside North America is a joint concern with Mikoyan-and-Gurevich near Moscow. This plant is dedicated to the production of the Russian licensed version of the Devastator, which is fundamentally identical to the Mk III.Users Militias Pirates Appearances Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge  Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge is the 2003 sequel to Crimson Skies released on the Xbox video game console. Originally announced in March 2002 with a fall release date, the release was postponed until October 2003. The player controls the pirate Nathan Zachary through an arcade-style flying game including power-ups and CGI cut scenes. Split-screen, system-link and Xbox Live multiplayer modes allow up to 16 players to dogfight in six game types on five multiplayer maps. Downloadable content was also released (seven new plans, two new planes, two new gametypes and three new maps). At the core of the game is a campaign mode. It also featured destructible environments, including weapons located in hidden areas during the demo phase of the game as well\u00a0as Catalina, offcoast the French Lousania which features the zep casino, an island which features an Indian Temple and\u00a0other earlier maps. The game was built using Autodesk Maya.Plot  During a long night at a casino, Nathan Zachary, leader of the Fortune Hunters, lost his zeppelin and Devastator to Louis \"Wild Card\" Thibodeaux in a poker game. While Thibodeaux was able to claim the Pandora, Zachary was able to prevent him from taking the Devastator. Meeting up with fellow fortune hunter Betty Charles, they head to the Sea Haven island where the Ragin' Cajuns are hiding the Pandora. Destroying the Cajun defenders, the Fortune Hunters retook their zeppelin and headed to the main island to search for Big John. After accidentally destroying a radio tower, meeting up with their old friend Doctor Wilhelm Fassenbiender and clearing the harbor of Hollywood Knights planes, they find Big John running shipments for an arms dealer. Big John agrees to return to the Pandora now she's back in Fortune Hunter hands. Angered by Zachary's thefts, Thibodeaux retaliated in kind, stealing Betty's Devastator. Zachary responded by hiring a local boat captain to take him to the Cajuns' base, where he punched Thibodeaux off the dock and stole his Dauphin. Using the Dauphin's impressive armament, Zachary cut down the nearby Cajun zeppelin, eliminating the Ragin' Cajuns as a serious force in Sea Haven. Doctor Fassenbiender took advantage of the lull following the collapse of the Cajuns to have a private meeting with his old friend, Zachary. Giving him the plans for a device called a Wind Turbine, Fassenbiender warned Zachary that he had discovered an Arixo mine that would permit him to construct the Turbine - and that this had been discovered by his evil nemesis, Doctor Nicolas Von Essen, leader of the diabolical Die Spinne. Entrusting the blueprints of the Turbine to Zachary, Fassenbiender returned to his researches. With the collapse of the Cajuns, the Hollywood Knights seized their opportunity to exterminate the remaining pirate presence in Sea Haven. Reacting to the increased frequency of Knight patrols, the Fortune Hunters tracked down the Knight's hidden island base and destroyed it. On return to the Pandora, however, the Fortune Hunters received a frantic distress call from Doctor Fassenbiender. Racing to the doctor's remote island laboratory, the Pandora was set upon by Sanderson FB14 Vampires in an unusual dark-blue color scheme. While the Fortune Hunters were able to handily dispatch these attackers, the next wave appeared, escorted by a huge zeppelin. This zeppelin was powered by an exposed Tesla energy cell, which the Fortune Hunters promptly destroyed. The zeppelin crashed, but unleashed a Tesla tank. While the tank was also destroyed, it delayed the Fortune Hunters enough that their friend, Doctor Fassenbiender, was killed. Furious at the murder of their friend, the Fortune Hunters headed for Arixo, to investigate the doc's titanium mine. Despite being repeatedly set upon by Los Muertos and Red's Gang, the Fortune Hunters were able to persuade a local merchant, Roy, to lead them to a repair station. The owner, he said, might know the location of the mine. The station owner, Maria Sanchez, was prepared to direct the Fortune Hunters, but when her station was destroyed by vengeful Los Meurtos, she insisted the Fortune Hunters take her with them. Zachary, with Sanchez as his co-pilot, was able to kill Muerte, the leader of Los Meurtos, as well as destroying at least nine of their zeppelins. Sanchez revealed that the mine was deep inside Navajo Territory. Determined to proceed, Zachary rescued a sacred Navajo artefact from the remnants of Los Muertos. Big John, an old friend of Navajo ace Soloho Salawa, piloted the Pandora deep into Navajo Territory, where the Fortune Hunters arrived in time to help drive off Los Muerto attackers. Grateful for the assistance and the return of the statue, Soloho agreed to help the Fortune Hunters reach the mine - once Zachary had completed the Three Trials. Having completed the trials and earned the respect of Soloho, Zachary and the Fortune Hunters escorted a Navajo convoy to the mine to rescue a Navajo scouting party that had mysteriously disappeared. Arriving at the mine, the Fortune Hunters and the Navajo were attacked by Jonathan \"Genghis\" Kahn's Red Skull Legion. Devastated by the Fortune Hunters, the surviving Red Skulls called in their allies... Die Spinne. Die Spinne deployed another of their new Wunderwaffe - the Tunnelzug. Although well-armed and heavily-armored, the Tunnelzug fell before the Fortune Hunters, who proceeded directly to Chicago to confront Die Spinne's newest ally, Jonathan Kahn. Zachary and Charles confronted Kahn in his penthouse office. Unbeknownst to them, the white-suited man standing behind Kahn was none other than Von Essen, Doc's murderer. When Zachary reveals he knows what Die Spinne is, Von Essen orders him killed. Kahn attempts to comply, but Zachary bravely dives out of the window, leaving Charles in Kahn's custody. Stealing a Red Skulls Brigand, Zachary escorts the Pandora out from Kahn's clutches, destroying a Machiavelli-class zeppelin on the way. With the Pandora secured, Zachary begin his attempt to recover his captured co-pilot. Aided and abetted by the Red Skulls' fierce rivals, the DeCarlos gang, Zachary raided a Red Skulls train and destroyed numerous ground vehicles. Grateful for Zachary's help, the DeCarlos put him in touch with Wally Bag O'Donuts, also known as \"The Snitch\". Wally told Zachary that Betty was being held within the huge Red Skulls warehouse, and that by using a MiniGyro's Sniper Cannon to destroy the external door controls, Zachary could draw off the warehouse's defences and rescue his wingman. The operation was a success, and the Fortune Hunters added a second Brigand to their spoils. Following their daring escape from Kahn's Red Skulls, Zachary and Betty determined to exact a fearsome revenge on Kahn. Destroying a main brigde support to disable an armored train, the Fortune Hunters also destroyed six cargo zeppelins and then proceed to place five crates of TNT atop Kahn's tower. The resulting explosion destroyed the tower, along with considerable quantities of Kahn's inventory. Confronting Kahn once again, Zachary demanded an explanation. Kahn explained that Von Essen had presented a plan that would allow Kahn to take control of Chicago, but that Kahn had realised that Von Essen was utterly insane and would certainly betray him once his own plan was complete. Unconvinced, but unwilling to kill Kahn, Zachary spared his life in exchange for Red Skull assistance in hunting down Von Essen. Kahn's assessment of Von Essen's reliabilty was rapidly confirmed by a large attack force of Tesla zeppelins launched an attack on Chicago. Although the Fortune Hunters and the Red Skulls were able to drive off the smaller zeppelins, this allowed the Die Spinne Zepeater to make a close approach to the new allies' zeppelin formation. A Machiavelli-class zeppelin belonging to the Skulls was destroyed by the Zepeater Although unable to save the Red Skulls zep, the Fortune Hunters were able to destroy the Zepeater before it destroyed the Pandora. During the celebrations that followed this victory, Maria Sanchez stole Doctor Fassenbiender's Wind Turbine plans, intending to sell them to Die Spinne. Following Maria, the Fortune Hunters found Die Spinne's secret base, beneath the fabled Lost City. With the assistance of Professor Hancock, the Fortune Hunters were able to uncover the path to the Lost City, although the City's defences forced Zachary to proceed alone into the depths of the base. At the very heart of the base, Zachary confronted Von Essen again, seconds after the crazed scientist had shot Maria. Von Essen, driven mad by his own megalomania, proceeded to explain his entire evil scheme to Zachary, punctuated by machine gun bursts. Activating the base's self-destruct, Von Essen fled, leaving Zachary to hear Maria's dying apology and make his own escape past suicidally-devoted Die Spinne pilots and the exploding, collapsing base. Successfully escaping the base, the Fortune Hunters return to Chicago and team up again with the Red Skulls to take on Die Spinne. Furious at Kahn's betrayal, Von Essen determines to use the Wind Turbine - now integrated into the gigantic Starkesturm, to destroy the entire city of Chicago. Although he causes tremendous damage, Nathan Zachary, the Fortune Hunters and the Red Skulls were able to destroy the Starkesturm. Von Essen was\u00a0destroyed with his creation.Gallery  \u200bDifferences from Crimson Skies  Among the many changes from Crimson Skies to Crimson Skies: High Road To Revenge, the following are particularly noticable:Planes Characters Organizations Soundtrack  The 54-track soundtrack was released on CD, and included a bonus DVD with Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround mixes of the game trailer and two cues from the soundtrack. The composer was Stan LePard.Awards External links Countries Fairchild F611 Brigand  The Fairchild F611 Brigand is one of the most highly regarded heavy-fighter aircraft available today. Equipped with a powerful 16-cylinder engine, the Brigand has a high top speed, surprising agility for its weight, and impressive offensive capability. It has a reputation as reliable and effective, but also for poor fuel economy, quirky handling and a mediocre acceleration. The Brigand's high speed, poor acceleration and woeful fuel economy can be traced to the innovative Pratt & Whitney R-series engine. The R-series is the first heavy-duty engine to be equipped with a fuel-injection system, which does away with the need for a carburetor. The Brigand is short for its wingspan, and the uneven distribution of weight due to the heavy engine gives it particularly quirky handling characteristics. The Brigand does have an assortment of armament to help even these flaws. It has a pair of .50-caliber cannons on each wing, as well as a pair of rear mounted .30-caliber cannons. The Brigand is especially effective when loaded with a combination of explosive, armor-piercing or incendiary shells and a full load of rockets. Given its relatively small size and heavy armament, the Brigand is most often found in an anti-zeppelin role, usually as part of a small group under escort from more nimble fighters. It is also an effective ground-attack fighter, although in this role it requires exceptional fighter cover as its poor acceleration hampers its ability to recover from a strafing run. The Brigand was introduced in 1935 by the Arlington Angels of Columbia. It quickly earned a reputation and became enormously popular. Although all of Fairchild's plants are in Columbia, the company sells across North America and the Brigand is built with export in mind. The militias in the Confederation of Dixie are the largest buyers of Brigand, followed closely by Appalachian and Empire State militias. Deseret has also acquired the Brigand (the only national government to have). In addition, a single squadron is known to serve along the Navajo border. Fairchild is proud of its policy of neutrality, and is willing to sell the Brigand to pirate bands. Notable criminal users of the Brigand include Jonathan Kahn's Red Skull Legion, the Medusas, and the mysterious Black Hats.Armament  The Brigand features a pair of forward-firing .50-caliber machine guns, and a pair of .30-caliber machine guns mounted in its rear-firing turret. Though the turret adds considerable weight and further reduces the Brigand's maneuverability, it also ensures that the slow-moving heavy fighter will have an unpleasant surprise ready if another plane tries to attack it from behind.Appearances Hughes Bloodhawk  The Hughes Aviation Bloodhawk of Hollywood were designed by Howard Hughes. Stylish but functional, the Bloodhawk is extremely manuverable, even at high speeds. The Bloodhawk does however struggle with an unusually high stall speed. Containing precision-balanced weapons and sighting systems, the Bloodhawk has earned a lethal reputation. It is currently one of the fastest aircraft in service. At the Boeing Special Projects division in Pacifica, Doctor Willhem Fassenbiender was working on an experimental Bloodhawk, codenamed Blue Streak, and instead of the standard Allison V engine, it could be given one with a nitro injection which allows a sudden burst of speed for a small period of time (see The Pilfered Prototype).Appearances  The Bloodhawk appears as a flyable aircraft during The Pilfered Prototype, and is available in the hangar for customization thereafter.Trivia  The Bloodhawk's design is very similar to the Henschel P.75, an experimental Luftwaffe aircraft developed during WWII.Appearances Focke-Wulf Fw 206 Doppleganger  Focke-Wulf constructed this heavy fighter as a replacement for their Fw 198 Hellhound, and were rather gratified when the German government bought up the entire first production run of 250 units. However, not a single Doppleganger has appeared on a Luftwaffe base, and Focke-Wulf found the government unwilling to purchase any more. Faced with the unenviable prospect of a large stock with no buyer, Focke-Wulf put the Doppleganger up for sale on the open market, where it has sold much like the craft handles - slowly, sluggishly and with the creeping sensation that it's about to stop altogether. The Doppleganger's primary weapon, the Blockbuster cannon, was adapted from a Krupp 80mm tank cannon, making it the largest gun ever mounted on a production aircraft. Following the mysterious disappearence of the first production run, Dopplegangers were seen in Die Spinne livery, providing heavy fire support to Die Spinne's other craft of choice, the Messerschmitt Pirahna.Trivia Appearances Curtiss-Wright J2 Fury  The Curtiss-Wright J2 Fury is able to reach speeds up to 250 MPH, and still maintain maneuverability, due to its 14-cylinder Wright R-1800-C engine. The Fury is easily stalled, however, making it difficult to fly for beginners. The Fury's mix of speed and armament make it a capable interceptor and effective against zeppelins.All up the J2 Fury is a masterpiece when used to out maneuver enemies. Its not the type of fighter to go head on against another plane. When fitted with torpedoes, it is also an excellent fast strike bomber.Appearances Ravenscroft Coyote  The Ravenscroft Coyote  is a custom-built plane manufactured by the Hopi at Second Mesa. The Coyote is able to successfully fill varying roles, even against aircraft designed for a single role. In particular, the Coyote serves as a spotter, bomber, and a gunship for the Native American tribes.Appearances Fortune Hunters  The Fortune Hunters are based on the zeppelin Pandora, and comprise the airship's crew as well as six pilots\u2014Nathan Zachary and his wingman Jack Mulligan, \"Tex\" Ryder and her wingman \"Buck\" Deere, \"Big John\" Washington and Betty \"Brooklyn\" Charles. Later joining Nathan and his gang are Dr. Wilhelm Fassenbiender, a scientist and friend of Nathan's since the Great War, as well as his daughter, Dr. Ilsa Fassenbiender. The Fortune Hunters have many rival pirate gangs and privateers, such as The Black Swan, Jonathan \"Genghis\" Kahn, and Ulysses Boothe. Private security firms, such as Blake Aviation Security, and Category:Militias:militia squadrons, such as the Hollywood Knights, are also trying to take down the Fortune Hunters. Many of these opponents are old rivals or former love interests of Nathan Zachary.Behind the scenes  IGN has stated that the Fortune Hunters are \"wonderfully ambiguous [\u2026] in the moral sense,\" qualifying that \"It's always great to see heroes [\u2026] who aren't too good to be true.\"Zeppelin  A Zeppelin is a type of rigid airship or dirigible pioneered by the German Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin in the early 20th century. It was based on designs he had patented in the United States on 14 March 1899. Given the outstanding success of the Zeppelin design, the term zeppelin in casual use came to refer to all rigid airships.History  Zeppelins were operated by the Deutsche Luftschiffahrts-AG (DELAG). DELAG, the first commercial airline, served scheduled flights before World War I. After the outbreak of war, the German military made extensive use of Zeppelins as bombers and scouts. The World War I defeat of Germany in 1918 halted the airship business temporarily. But under the guidance of Hugo Eckener, the deceased Count's successor, civilian zeppelins became popular in the 1920s. With the creation of border checkpoints following the failure of the federal Prohibition movement, the zeppelin became an efficient method of transporting goods. When the interstate borders were sealed during the Great Influenza Epidemic, zeppelins became essential. The critical innovation of Zeppelin was the design of the internal frame of his airship, consisting of rings and longitudinal metal struts. This design allowed the use of numerous, smaller gas-inflated cells in place of the single overpressured lifting body of earlier dirigibles. The use of a rigid body and multiple gas cells allowed Zeppelin's airships to be equipped with ever-greater quantities of engine thrust as well as granting increased lifting power. While German zeppelins were deployed during the Great War and afterwards, there was a constant risk of deadly fire due to the lifting gas used - hydrogen. The Germans used hydrogen only because the much safer alternative - helium - was unavailable, initially due to wartime embargoes and later because of the collapse of the United States, which dramatically reduced the output of helium.Modern Airships  Most airships used in North America are lifted with helium, which is the chief export of Free Colorado and the Republic of Texas. Large quantities are also produced by the Deseret Lifting Gas Company, but these supplies are for the exclusive use of Deseret citizens and their sometimes-allies, the Navajo. A wide variety of zeppelins now fill the skies above North America, from the small but sturdy Rigger-class cargo zeppelin to the vast Curelom-class military zeppelin, designed as the bulwark of an aerial fleet. Zeppelin luxury passenger liners and superheavy cargo carriers are commonplace, and only the smallest and most isolated of towns does not boast at least one mooring tower. Most zeppelins are powered by Blaugas, or \"blue\", a gaseous fuel with the same density as air. This means that as the fuel is used, the fuel tanks are allowed to fill with air, absolving the pilot of the need to constantly alter trim to compensate for the ever-decreasing weight of fuel. Blaugas is named for its inventor, Dr. Hermann Blau of Augsburg, Germany.Recent Developments  With the rise of air piracy, most zeppelins now mount at least one weapon for self-defence, and the vast majority carry two or three. Military zeppelins expecting to face fighter opposition also use strafing wires - thin, strong wires held on struts around the zeppelin to prevent strafing fighters from approaching too closely. In response, aircraft companies developed a number of anti-zeppelin strategies, including the construction of dedicated anti-zeppelin aircraft. Such developments include:Anti-zeppelin tools Anti-zeppelin tactics  There are two primary methods for eliminating zeppelins - one for Crimson Skies, one for Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge.Anti-zeppelin weapons Anti-zeppelin aircraft  Some content on this page lifted wholesale from WikipediaMesserschmitt Bf 106 Piranha  Produced under close security at the Bayerische Flugzeugwerke, the Bf 106 was bought exclusively by agents of the German government and supplied to Von Essen and his Die Spinne group. Von Essen had the Piranha's hardpoints replaced with his own Tesla projector, a weapon designed to disable an enemy's avionics, making him easy prey to the Piranha's machine guns. Although effective, the Piranha suffered against heavier opposition, and was almost totally ineffective against zeppelins. Von Essen therefore acquired the Focke-Wulf Fw 206 Doppleganger to provide his growing air force with heavier firepower. Die Spinne air forces rapidly developed the most effective strategy - Piranhas would distract and destroy escort fighters, while the heavier Dopplegangers would use their earthshattering Blockbuster cannon to destroy hard targets.Appearances Focke-Wulf Fw 193 Hellhound  The distinctive forward-swept wing profile of this unique German aircraft has become an increasingly common sight in the skies over the North America. Though predominantly used in Europe, the Focke-Wulf Hellhound is gradually gaining acceptance by militias and private security firms on the other side of the Atlantic, despite the plane's hefty price tag and maintenance requirements. The Hellhound was one of the first combat planes released under the German militia program of the early 1930s. The Hellhound was intended to serve in an anti-pirate role, and has the firepower and versatility to overwhelm the Central European air pirates that once plagued the under-armed German nation. The Hellhound was designed under the restrictions imposed by the Treaty of Versailles, which restricted aircraft to the equivalent of .30- and .40-caliber machine guns, so the German designers put as many lighter machine guns on it as they could fit, including a .30-caliber turret. There was no treaty restriction on rocket hard-points, however, and the Hellhound can carry a devastating payload of eight rockets or other munitions. The Hellhound is exported to the ISA, is in the service of some private and corporate militias, and is currently undergoing evaluation in the Republic of Texas for service with the Texas Air Rangers. The I.S.A. and other American militias have made various modifications usually to up-gun the Hellhound's firepower, but no clear trend has evolved. Currently, many speculate that a syndicate of arms and aviation manufacturers based in the ISA plan to license the design and begin building \"home-grown\" Hellhounds by 1939.Hughes Firebrand  The Hughes Aviation Firebrand is one of the newest aircraft in use. There are currently fewer than 60 in service. The Firebrand was designed as a flying wing, allowing high altitudes to be attained and a formidable weapon payload, but causes a reduction of the agility, speed and acceleration. The Firebrand is the signature aircraft of the Hollywood Knights, and almost the entire Hughes Aviation production is dedicated to that militia. The Knights' predeliction for the Firebrand is explained by its considerable range, allowing the Knights to strike remote targets such as Sea Haven and other offshore pirate bases. It then appeared in Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge as a NPC plane and later as a DLC plane available only for Multiplayer.Appearances Curtiss-Wright P2 Warhawk  The Curtiss-Wright P2 Warhawk was designed as a light bomber, therefore being able to carry a significant weapons payload and have a large operating distance. It is considered somewhat out-of-date, although is still capable of performing precision strikes at long-distance targets.Trivia  The Warhawk's design is very similar to the Blohm & Voss P.170.01, a Luftwaffe's aircraft during WWIIAppearances Sanderson FB14 Vampire  The Sanderson FB14, unofficially known as the Vampire, clocking in at 13,250 pounds, is one of the heaviest fighters in operation. Although it closely resembles a bomber, it is used as a dogfighter. As is suggested by its weight, it is cumbersome and slow. The Vampire is, however, extremely well armed and armored. The Vampire was designed as a heavy fighter-bomber, but two other variants also exist: a photoreconnaissance plane and a general-purpose cargo plane. Several Vampires were covertly purchased by Die Spinne to provide them with a heavy fighter-bomber while production was ongoing for the Focke-Wulf Fw 206 Doppleganger. Vampires were deployed against the Fortune Hunters zeppelin Pandora during the Die Spinne attack on Doctor Wilhelm Fassenbiender. The FB14 has no official nickname, but earned the moniker \"Vampire\" from ground crews because of the plane's high maintenance requirements. The plane has a reputation as a \"hangar queen\", requiring careful and thorough maintenance, as well as no small amount of money to keep it flying. Most users, however, consider the Vampire's firepower to be worth it, game files may or may not exist for the plane in Crimson Skies.Appearances Bell Valiant Mk II  The Bell Valiants were produced in Marietta, Georgia, starting in November 1934. It is a small, agile fighter, ideal for dogfighting and able to out-turn almost any other aircraft. The Valiant is primarily used to protect fixed installations, as it requires a long runway for take off and a short operational range of 350 miles. Despite its small turning circle and excellent acceleration, the Valiant's short operational range has relegated it to the role of point defense for Confederate forces. Valiants were used to devastating effect against Appalachian bandits during the mid 1930s, primarily because the pirates wrote off the Valiants as being too short-legged to pose a threat. Outside of Dixie, the Bell Valiant Mk II is also found in the service of the Republic of Texas, Utah, and Arixo. A new Bell factory in Burlington in former Vermont in the Maritime Provinces anticipates the spread of the Valiant in the Provinces and Quebec as well. In the Crimson Skies universe, the Bell Valiant is one of several aircraft to be advertised on the game's official website without ever actually appearing in-game, there is a rumor that game files may exist for the Bell\u00a0Valiant Mk II.Design History  Originally designed by and built in the Confederation of Dixie by Bell, the Valiant Mk I featured a single Pratt & Whitney P7 750hp engine, which failed to give it the acceleration and top speed to make it comeptitive with other fighters of its time. The Mk I with its underpowered engine was sent back to the drawing board and reborn as the Mk II, the P7 engine having been replaced by a powerful 950hp Rolls Royce Morgana. Shortly after its production began, all Mk I's were fitted with the new Morgana engine as well. Despite being small, fast, and nimble, the Bell Valiant Mk II suffers from a few points in its design. It is most affected in the area of weaponry, where the Valiant falls short due to the trade-off between agility and strength. Its size also prevents it from having a range of longer than 350 miles, removing it from the patrol or loitering duties necessary when tending to escorting zeppelins or partaking in long range interdictions. Instead, it serves mainly as a point defense fighter. The Valiant's versatility is further affected by its pusher-prop and cruciform tail configurations. In order to prevent striking the propeller on takeoff or landing, the pilot cannot angle the nose up more than ten degrees, a shallow angle compared to the usual thirty to forty-five of pull-prop aircraft. This restriction demands the use of a long runway so the pilot has adequate space to gain and bleed speed on takeoff and landing respectively. Thankfully, this problem has no bearing on zeppelin docking operations, which Valiant pilots find quite easy to handle.Armaments  \"It might be small and lightly armed, but don't bet against this agile little blighter.\" \u2014Pilot officer Michael Kirk Rawlins, RAF liaison to the Dixie Confederacy The Valiant's goal of being a light and agile fighter meant sacrificing firepower. Adorned with only six Springfield Mark IV .30-caliber machine guns, most Valiant pilots find that magnesium rounds and rockets are necessary for an effective loadout. Valiant pilots like the Alabama Mud Hoppers, a private militia based out of Mobile, have demonstrated a compensation for the plane's low armor and weaponry through close teamwork, namely in the form of pack-hunting tactics. Having faced off several times against the Louisiana-based Chapeau d'Or Squadron and their stronger but slower Morane-Saulnier MS382s, the Mud Hoppers have used the element of surprise in conjunction with boom-and-zoom tactics to take down lone pairs of the French fighters, usually while in flights of six Valiants or more.Appearances William and Colt Peacemaker 370  The William and Colt Peacemaker 370 were built after the Texas/Mexico conflict. The Peacemaker depends on brute force, rather than finesse. Usually the Peacemaker is used as an anti-zeppelin plane, especially the gunship variant.Appearances McDonnell S2B Kestrel  The McDonnell S2B Kestrel has a fast speed, excellent range, and substantial load of bombs and rockets allowing it to be an excellent anti-zeppelin craft. It has a unique dual hull, which allows for enhanced stability in level flight, but limited maneuverability in a dogfight. It is one of the preferred machines of the Medusas, as well as for the Confederation of Dixie.Appearances Dassault MD 445 Dauphin  The Dassault MD 445 Dauphin is a fairly unusual sight in North America. Manufactured in France, the Dauphin is only officially available for sale in French Louisiana and the R\u00e9publique de Quebec. Heavy cannon and triple-rockets make the small, nimble Dauphin a remarkably effective anti-zeppelin aircraft, although it suffers against other fast-moving fighters. Its amphibious capability means that it is popular with coastal pirate gangs, especially the Ragin' Cajuns.Grumman E-1C Avenger  The Grumman E-1C Avenger sports twin engines and fill the role of interceptor and, occasionally, reconnaissance or light-strike craft. The Avenger rarely serves as an escort because of its mediocre maneuverability and armor, which make it a poor craft for dogfighting. The Avenger is confirmed to have existed in the earlier beta version of the Crimson Skies PC game.Appearances Nathan Zachary  Nathan Zachary is well known with a reputation of being a ladies' man and a notorious air pirate. He is the leader of a group of sky pirates, the Fortune Hunters.Biography Life as an Air Pirate  Zachary dislikes the wealthy and privileged, he sees them as selfish and insensitive towards others and, as a result, the Fortune Hunters often attempt to strip the rich of their money and influence. Zachary is not without rules, however, his \"Articles of Piracy\" insist that innocents should not be harmed, and that pirates should steal only from those who can afford the loss.Appearances Pandora  Once the Empire Air zeppelin Fulcrum, the Pandora is the zeppelinhome of the Fortune Hunters. The Pandora has undergone a number of upgrades and alteration over her life, moving from a slow, underarmed cargo carrier to a swift-moving, gun-toting, plane-carrying angel of death. By the time of the Die Spinne crisis in 1938, the Pandora carried eight .50-cal machine gun turrets, two 25mm cannon turrets and a belly-mounted magnetic missile launcher. The internal Rolls-Royce cyclic hanger rack could carry up to six craft in launch-ready position, and up to another eight on standby racks.", "CAWiki": "CAWiki Combat Arms Wiki Assault Rifles  This category contains pages related to Assault Rifles. To add an article, image, or category to this category, go to source mode and append  to the end of the page.Primary  A primary weapon is a weapon that you can select in your primary slot and backpack slots. It is the weapon that players use for the majority of the game, and generally is more effective in combat than secondary or melee weapons. There are currently 6 types of primary weapons. Primary weapons include Assault Rifles, Sub Machine Guns, Machine Guns, Sniper Rifles,Shotguns, and Explosive Projectiles.M16A3  The M16A3 Assault Rifle is the default primary weapon in Combat Arms. It posesses burst fire as well as an automatic firing mode. Every player is granted the M16 when they first create their character, making it the first gun without a cost to use. As such, the M16A3 is often used by users who do not have enough GP or NX to buy other weapons, as well as those who want to save up.Overview  When the user is not spraying or running around, the M16A3 is surprisingly accurate to the point that it has nearly the same long-range efficiency as the FAMAS. As such, one can pick off enemies with headshots from medium to medium-long range with relative ease. In addition, the recoil pattern is set in a way that results in many unexpected headshots for the player. This works especially well at close range. Tap firing works well in mid-long range engagements, and even more so if a scope is attached. Do note that the damage drops off at longer engagements, making the weak M16A3 even weaker. The most glaring issue is its stopping power. With a borderline 5-6 shot kill, it is one of the weakest weapons in the entire game (including pistols). Not even its decent rate of fire can make up for the lack of damage output. This gun is definitely not meant for CQC because of its low damage and high spread. Another drawback of this gun is its spread, which expands quickly but recovers slowly. This makes it very difficult for hip-firing.Trivia Sniper Rifles  This category contains pages related to Sniper Rifles.

It comes with a pre-attached iTech reflex sight, a shorter barrel, and a foregrip. It has several statistical advantages over the M416, including one point higher damage, and four points higher portability. The M416 CQB has a relatively small spread area and low recoil. Furthermore, the recoil pattern of the gun goes up very slightly in a vertical line. These two factors allow the weapon to be easily controllable at longer ranges. This caused the gun to become very popular with early players, and gain notoriety for it's ease of use, often being cited as one of the first, \"Overpowered\" weapons.Events Trivia G36E  The Heckler & Koch G36 is a gas-powered Assault Rifle. It can be bought from the Shop.Overview  The G36E is a GP Assault Rifle, which can be bought from the shop for 4,655 GP for 7 days. It is an extremely popular weapon for many reasons, including the high-magnification scope, powerful damage, and amazing accuracy. Many players buy the G36E for its clean look, as well as for utilizing its excellent stats. It is also a popular and widely used weapon in other FPS games, which further adds to its popularity. Within the Shop, there is one other weapon, the AUG A1, which equals the G36E in price and nearly equals it in stats. The two often cause debates as to which gun is the better weapon, as each one has its flaws and advantages. The G36E is an excellent gun in both long and close-range combat. Its power and speed can take down most enemies within close range, while its scope can pick them off from afar. This gun is a three-shot kill in close quarters, and a 4 shot at longer ranges. Attaching a suppressor reduces the damage to make it a weak 4 shot kill.Events Trivia M416 Overview  Much like the purpose of its real-life version, the 416 is a newer system that tries to fill gaps the M4A1 possesses. Although they seem to have very similar characteristics at first glance, the two rifles do perform differently overall. While the in-game Shop statistics only show a slight advantage by being two points lighter and an extra point less on recoil, they can be radically different depending on the users' play style. During in-game comparisons, this rifle has extremely low recoil, which is especially noticeable when looking through an optic. Even with a higher rate of fire, the 416 is controllable for longer automatic firing, whereas the M4A1 suffers with erratic bullet spread after a sustained burst. Unlike certain weapons under the same category, the 416 is a strong multitasking system and can be a formidable, highly-controllable assault rifle up to its maximum range without sacrificing firepower or accuracy.Custom Changes Events Trivia Sounds Submachine Guns  This category contains pages related to Submachine Guns.

A Permanent item can save people the worry of having to lose a lot of money over something, because that one item will not expire for an\u00a0extremely long time. Thus, you can use over and over again (constantly) without fear of having to give it up. The majority of Permanent items can only found in the Black Market, and most of them cost a large amount of NX. Most Permanent items are weapons, and with the exception of the Clan Emblem, Gender Changes, and any resets. All other types of Permanent items (including vests, camos, and other gear) are exceedingly rare. Currently, most of the weapons in the Black Market (excluding Specialist or non-Primary/Secondary weapons) have been available for Permanent purchase at one point. The standard price of an Assault Rifle or Sub-Machine Gun is approximately 24,900 NX. Sniper Rifles cost the most, with a standard price of 29,900 NX. Machine Guns and Shotguns are cheaper, with a standard price of 19,900 NX. Secondary weapons are the cheapest of all the Permanent weapons; with a standard price of only 9,900 NX. These prices do not include special sales, in which the prices may drastically drop (up to 60-70% off). However, some of the more popular NX items will still cost more than other items of the same category. (Even with the sale discount, UMP-45/ or P90TR cost more than the G3 by several percent) Up until February 3, 2010, Permanent items could not be bought with anything other than NX (Black Hi-Sec cases cost money, and the other weapons were available only from the Black Market). However, thanks to an overwhelming number of complaints, the first GP-Permanent weapon, the G36E, was released for 100,000 GP in a one-day sale. Since then. there have been an increasing number of GP-Permanent items, most of which have depended on the number of increasing Facebook fans. Near the end of 2010, the year-old Permanent option was slowly being removed from the game, a process that was occurring to other Nexon games (Like MapleStory) as well.Beginning with the M1866, the Permanent system was gradually replaced with a lend-and-lease system. Instead of adding a Permanent option for new NX items indefinitely, players will have a limited time period to buy an item permanently after it is released. After that, it will not be offered for permanent duration with the exception of sales, which in that case the item is on sale for permanent for a lower price. In 2012, Nexon decided to return the permanent duration through the Return of the Perms Sale. This three part sale lasted from August 16 to September 26th. Afterwards, all perms are now available for normal prices.Default Switch  When using a special Default Item switch, players can switch out their (permanent) default weapons or items for a different item of the same category. However, in the process, you permanently lose whatever item you traded it for. Many unique weapons were once offered as a Default switch, such as the UMP and the USP. None of these items are to be confused with their LE counterparts. Furthermore, the Default Switch program has been\u00a0discontinued.Limited Edition (LE)  Limited Edition (LE) Items are also permanent items, though they are usually much rarer than a standard Permanent weapon. From time-to-time, a Limited Edition item may be released permanently, and each item differs from the next. But instead of having to exchange an existing item for one, they come as a separate but permanent addition to your arsenal. Most of the time, these items are special Supply Case or Black Market exclusive items. LE items, however, are not limited to just weaponry. Other various items have also been sold permanently, such as Clan and Player Name Color Changes, as well as a Limited Edition Mercenary. and may continue to do so in the future. Like Permanent items, LE items can be bought for a large sum of NX as well, but they can also be randomly awarded through the Black HiSec Cases. LE items can be noted for having the \"LE\" in their name, which distinguishes them in-game and on the website. Other than that, LE weapons are exactly the same as their normal counterparts. Once you purchase a weapon permanently, it cannot be bought again from the Black Market, the same goes for the Default Switch weapons and the GP LE weapons from the Shop. Nowadays, more and more items are carrying the status of \"LE,\" though they may necessarily not be Permanent. At the same time, items that would truly be considered as an LE item do not carry the title.Milestones  These are the record-breaking moments in Permanent history. Default items, originally Permanent items (stuff which were released with an automatic permanent duration), and upgrades of items do not count.

It was developed by Doobic Studios, a South Korean company, and published by Nexon.Starting Out  After logging-in for the first time, players will choose unique character name. This alias determines their individuality within the game, and allows them to make a name for themselves. Secondly, players will choose their base character model. This determines their gender and ethnicity, which bears no effect on gameplay, and can be changed later\u00a0on. After everything is finished and confirmed, the player will move on to a tutorial of the game. Though optional, it is highly recommended for newer users who aren't familiar with the controls of the game. This allows them to acclimate themselves to the different aspects of Combat Arms. If the player needs to sharpen up their skills, they may re-experience the tutorial at any time by clicking F1.Joining a Game  Upon completion of the tutorial (and following every successive login thereafter), players can access the main game server. To relieve system stress, the main server is divided into smaller servers. Rank-restricted servers prevent novice players from going against highly-professional ones, while open servers allow higher-ranked players to assist or practice with lower ones. Some servers may even feature unique settings, such as Rec Rules (a type of casual gameplay) or \"Difficulty\" (for holiday events). Each server is further divided into channels, which contain a central lobby filled with individual game rooms. Players can join a room that suits their needs, such as a certain mode or map, or create their own. Each room features a\u00a0Room Moderator, who sets the rules and restrictions of a game. They determine whether or not a player can join mid-combat (in the middle of a game), if\u00a0Friendly Fire\u00a0will be on in certain game modes, and whether or not the Killcam\u00a0is active (also for certain modes). Room Moderators also\u00a0choose the map, game mode, time/score limits, and weapon/gear restrictions (such as \"Melee Only,\" \"No Sniper Rifles,\" or \"No Backpacks\").\u00a0Elite\u00a0or\u00a0Super Elite Moderator\u00a0status further allows you to kick unruly players, regardless if they are a teammate or enemy.The Emporium  Players are able to obtain an in-game currency known as\u00a0Gear Points\u00a0(GP) and experience (EXP) after a match. A new rank allows you to unlock new weapons and equipment, while GP allows you to purchase those items. Any time before or after a game, players can access the Emporium. This area of the game allows players to access the Shop, customize their items, or take on daily missions.The Shop  The various items for sale range from hats to machine guns, as well as other special items that can't be found anywhere else. Players may customize their weapons with silencers, larger or faster-loading magazines, and different types of scopes to improve accuracy. However, Combat Arms runs on a rental system - rarely allowing players to buy permanent items. Instead, they may borrow an item for a set period of time, such as 1 day, 7 days, 30 days, or 90 days. Players may also purchase items with real-life money instead, providing them with easy access to normally rank-restricted items.\u00a0Weapon Customization  Several weapons, once purchased, can be further customized to suit the player's needs. By talking to Bubba Ares, the curator of the Emporium, players are able to improve the potential of their weapons (such as increasing firepower). Some weapons can also be combined or forged in order to create new, more powerful weapons. However, parts are needed in order to create those weapons, which can be obtained through the Wheel of Fate.Daily Jobs  Each day, a new set of missions are available from various clients around the world. An operative named\u00a0Janine\u00a0is your connection to that outside world, and will assign you to the tasks of your choice. Completing these missions will reward you with exclusive items or payment that would otherwise be difficult to obtain. Once you've completed your quota of tasks for the day, you must wait until the next day for a new set of missions.Gameplay  Combat Arms is an MMOFPS that focuses on multiplayer gaming. Players will work together towards a common objective or fight each other through different scenarios. Only one person can play from a single computer at any time. Once you enter a game, you are thrust into a world of compelling action and fast-paced thinking.\u00a0Game Modes  Many of Combat Arms' game modes are self-explanatory. Capture the Flag requires you to obtain the other team's flag and bring it back to your own, and making sure that the opposing team does not retrieve yours. Seize and Secure will force you to go against an opposing team in a race to seize the most mission items within a certain time period. Last Man Standing pits you against all other players in a contest of survival.\u00a0 To see which game modes each region have, please click here.Maps  Combat Arms takes place in a vast world that features many different landscapes. Each map varies in design, terrain, and notable landmarks. For example, some maps may have buildings and other areas of interest to hide in, while others take place in an open, sprawling area. Several maps throw you into the heart of the wilderness, while other maps confine you to the darkness of an underground facility. Each map contains\u00a0objects\u00a0that may not be found in any other map.Game Mode Changes  Occasionally, the environment of a map may even\u00a0change to suit\u00a0a game mode. In Quarantine, for example, the maps (based on currently-existing ones) feature more or less areas than they normally would. Access to a high-rising crane is restricted in a Quarantined Oil Rig, while a Quarantined Junk Flea allows more access to its central walkway.\u00a0 In game modes such as Spy Hunt, Search & Destroy, or playing under\u00a0Rec Rules, items that are normally unassociated with the map will appear in designated locations; some of which are essential to a mode and its objectives.Updating Maps  Maps are sometimes updated to support a game mode later on. Aspects of a map may be added, removed, changed around, or disabled in order to prevent lag and broken gameplay. Newly-released maps may be updated with player suggestions, or to fix a previously undiscovered glitch. To see which maps are avaliable in each region, please click here.Criticism ONLY PART THAT STILL NEEDS REVISION  During its first year, there have been drastic changes to the game. The game has been expanded massively, adding content such as the\u00a0Black Market,\u00a0Female\u00a0characters,\u00a0Voting\u00a0and\u00a0reporting\u00a0system, and popular game modes and items. Other changes included loading screen changes, layouts of the menus and lobbies, and even the theme music (which didn't change until the end of September 2009). Among all these gaming perks, there are also many disadvantages. Combat Arms has been criticized for the inaccurate statistics of the weapons. It was also criticized for its extremely strict profanity filter. For example, if a player wishes to say \"sniper\", it will show up as s**er, filtering the \"nip\" out of the word (any profanity, no matter how many letters, shows up as **). The profanity filter is now less strict and can be turned off because of a recent patch. In August 21, 2008, Nexon's server maintenance also came under fire for the \"witch-hunt\" style player bans being put in place. While results are mixed, it is believed that all players confirmed to have been cheating were banned or demoted to the lowest rank, Trainee. Many of these players claim innocence, saying that they only did it once or by accident. The engine has also been known to ban certain players for no discernable reason, including those who are not even playing. Many players claim that Combat Arms allows many capabilities of a \"real\" (meaning using money to buy it) First-Person Shooter game. However, the widespread use of cheat and hacking programs have frustrated old and new players alike and made the community of Combat Arms prone to \"haccusating\" every good player. But the new arrival of more content, events, abilities, and game modes have been able to revive some interest for new gamers and possibly some former players. Nexon proudly announced that more than two million accounts have been made since March 2009, and the number of players has been growing since. Combat Arms surpasses Counter Strike (CS) and Soldier Front based on players and value.Timeline  This is a known list of notable dates in Combat Arms history.Combat Arms Korea Combat Arms (Global)  Exclusively for Nexon AmericaCombat Arms Europe  At the same time in Europe.Combat Arms Brazil Combat Arms Russia Trivia See also M4A1 Overview  The M4A1 was one of the first assault rifles released in the game. While its stats are barely discernible from those of the M16A3, the difference between the two weapons is exceptional. The M416 CQB is often compared to the M4A1 in terms of efficiency. The M4A1's low recoil makes it easy to control. When looking through a scope, one can fire a continuous stream of bullets and still hit targets at long distances. The recoil pattern is irregular compared to other Assault Rifles'. The first few shots will result in vertical recoil. However, continued automatic fire will cause the recoil to change to a side to side motion. This may be remedied through tap-firing. Despite the low damage (medium-to-weak 4-hit kill), the M4A1 is one of the best available choices for CQC with its light weight, fire rate, and low spread. Low damage drop-off makes this gun as effective as other higher ranked Assault Rifles at long ranges. This gun may be customized in the Gun Emporium with all customization modes. The M4A1 is superseded by many similar, low-recoil weapons such as the M416, causing NX users and many high-ranking players to choose superior weapons.PR1ML Event Variant  From 04/01/2016 until 04/02/2016, turn up the volume and hop into Combat Arms to check out a fun new style for the menu lobby screens. Make sure your music volume is on in-game! The PR1ML variant, it's a replica from the original M4A1, but when you draw the gun or reload it, it's sounds a little different, like a elephant. In Combat Arms Brazil, it was renamed to: M4A1 Elefante.Events  This weapon has been offered for Permanent duration during the following events:Trivia AK-47  The Avtomat Kalashnikova 1947 is an Assault Rifle purchasable in the Shop with GP at the rank of Private or above.Overview  The AK-47 a powerful assault rifle that surpasses many in terms of strength. It is a solid three-shot kill weapon, and a three or four-shot kill with a suppressor. It also has the highest accuracy of all the GP Standard assault rifles. The high damage and accuracy is balanced, however, by a high amount of recoil, spread, and a slow rate of fire. The spread is extremely high after 5-10 shots, while firing it automatically . Tap firing takes advantage of the AK-47's high accuracy, while countering most of the high recoil.Events  This weapon has been sold for a Permanent duration during the following events:Trivia Classic Viper  Codename: Viper (Classic) is an elite female Specialist. Along with Scorpion, she was one of the first Specialists ever to be released in Combat Arms.Tactical Advantage Overview  Classic Viper is fast, has a slim base model, and is able to crouch lower than most characters and thus remain hidden much easier. In addition, Classic Viper has a Stamina increase of 30%, surpassing the Black Beret/ROKMC Hat and falling only behind Classic Raven and the Shapka. Classic Viper was purchasable (with a rank of Second Lieutenant/I) from the Shop and Black Market, with a price of 3,900 NX for a 7-day period and a price of 7,900 NX for a 30-day period for the latter. Viper could have also been obtained permanently from a Black HiSec Case (though the chance was exceedingly slim).Popularity  Not surprisingly, Classic Viper was one of the most popular Specialists (or any Mercenary for that matter) due to the fact that many people admired her looks and statistical boosts. And just like Classic Hawk and Classic Raven, she greatly overshadows Classic Scorpion in terms of abilities.Trivia Pistols  This category contains pages related to Pistols.

At certain ranges, Heavy Vesters\u00a0and even Light Vesters may easily survive a shot in the foot or arm. The biggest drawback of this weapon, however, is its accuracy at a rating of 90. It is the lowest of all Sniper Rifles in the game, and even lower than some Assault Rifles.PR1ML Event Variant  From 04/01/2016 until 04/02/2016, turn up the volume and hop into Combat Arms to check out a fun new style for the menu lobby screens. Make sure your music volume is on in-game! The PR1ML variant, it's a replica from the original L96A1, but when you fire the gun or reload it, it's sounds a little different, like a horse. In Combat Arms Brazil, it was renamed to: M4A1 Equina.Events Trivia Mercenaries  Mercenaries are special characters that can be \"hired\" to fight for the Player, in exchange for an NX or GP payment. Mercenaries give players a chance to look unique, while granting the player some sort of advantage. For more information, see Mercenaries.Shotguns  This category contains pages related to Shotguns.

It was introduced in the 07-28-09 Patch.Overview  As the name implies, a group of players have been quarantined within a specific map. Several amongst you have unknowingly been\u00a0Infected. Your mission is to \"Quarantine\" the area, and make sure The Infection does not spread outside of the map. The human team will attempt to take down the Infected and stay alive, while the Infected will hunt down the survivors. Players are expected to work together, and use their skills, dexterity, and knowledge of the terrain to win.Gameplay Gameplay  Pre-game: There is a period of 20 seconds of which the humans can prepare for the\u00a0Host Infected to be chosen. Actual game: After the 20 seconds are over, 1-3 humans\u00a0will be chosen to become Host Infected, depending on the amount of players currently in the round. If there are less than 12, there will only be two Infected. If there are more than 12 players, then it will be 3.Rounds  There are 3 ways that a round can end. Note that you must still be \"alive\" by the end of a round in order to gain any points. So if you're aiming to get EXP, then suicide is highly discouraged in Quarantine Regen.Rules  In order for an Infected to infect a human, they must hit them once at close range. The Infected can be knocked back with gunfire, and are only immobile when crouching. Use their lack of balance to their advantage, by keeping them at bay and potentially knocking them down from high ground. At the same time, crouch in order to waste your enemy's ammunition; and strike while they have to reload. The Infected can also heal as long as they're alive, so they should hide somewhere safe and slowly regain their health. Likewise, humans should track them down and eradicate them before they have a chance to heal. The Infected will regain 10% of their original health every 3 seconds when immobile; and any movement or damage inflicted will cause them to stop regenerating health. In several maps, there are \"Safe Rooms\" that the humans can enter at a certain point. Compared to most safe spots, safe rooms can literally be used to\u00a0hold out against the Infected and win, if players are sufficiently skilled enough. No safe room is perfect, however, as they each have their flaws and can be broken into eventually. For humans, it is recommended that you stay on guard and keep away from any openings in the safe room at all times, to ensure that you don't get Infected (especially around thin walls, windows, bars, and other open areas).\u00a0 For the Infected, one should use these vulnerabilites to strike an unsuspecting enemy from within the safe room and start an outbreak that could potentially end the game in your favor.Objectives The Infected  For more, see the Infected.The Infected  Unlike the Infected from Fireteam, these Infected in Quarantine are agile and much more deadly. They need no ammo and can spread\u00a0The Infection in one hit; while their high durability allows them to take a fair amount of damage before they can die.\u00a0 Infected have:Health Map Changes Maps  Currently, the Infection has spread to: Nexon may continue to randomly add Quarantine to maps that already exist, or design maps specifically for Quarantine.Map Changes (Varies from Map to Map.)  All \"Quarantined\" maps feature changes to the layout that suit new gameplay elements. In these \"alternate\" maps, what you may have been familiar with is now different. The only certainty is that there is no perfect \"safe spot\" in any map. (REVISIONS END HERE - 10/1/13)Strategies  Main Article: Quarantine Regen / Map StrategiesExploits  Main Article: Overdose/ExploitsEvents Trivia Glitches Trivia Infected General L96A1 Black-Magnum Overview  The Black-Magnum is statistically the same as the L96A1 Super-Magnum. It is basically a reskin of the L96A1 Super Magnum with a black skin covering the entire gun besides its muzzle brake and integrated scope. Like the Super-Magnum, the Black-Magnum incorporates a muzzle brake\u00a0to help control recoil, but prevents you from toning down its loudness. It also has a slightly lower draw speed in comparison to the rest of the L9 series, but has a faster reload speed than the Super Magnum.\u00a0As a Super Weapon  In Cabin Fever, the Black-Magnum appears as one of the Super Weapons\u00a0- enhanced to fight the Infected. This version of the weapon can kill a Mauler or a Charger with a single shot, which no other rifle (not even the ordinary Black-Magnum) is able to do.Item of the Week  On 4/23/2010, the Black-Magnum was the item of the week. Here is what the review included: \"This week\u2019s item of the week is the L96A1 Black-Magnum. This is a heavier variant of a classic sniper rifle chambered for an even more powerful Magnum round. The bolt has also been reworked for a faster reload. Like most sniper rifles, the L96A1 is best on larger maps with lots of open space and hidden positions where a sniper can set up a \"nest\" to take out unsuspecting victims. According to our Combat Arms soldiers, you'll definitely appreciate the qualities of the L96A1 Black Magnum on Snow Valley, Road Kill, Wave Rider and Two Towers. Fans of this gun also point out that it's more powerful shot can take out opponents even if they're wearing protection and have reported some success in destroying Enforcers in Cabin Fever.\" Let\u2019s see what a few of your fellow Combat Arms players had to say: \u201cThe L96A1 Magnum is a perfect weapon for all-around situations, for popping that annoying sniper's head in Snow Valley, (and) using its one-hit kill power and quick scoping for Junk Flea games.\u201d \u2013 Gus A. \u201cIts tremendous power makes it more or less impossible top tank a shot from this beast of a gun. This gun is in a class of its own. No L9 variant even comes close to the power of this gun. Its bolt speed is so fast one can even say that it is semi-automatic. Overall the best sniper I have used.\u201d \u2013 Diego W. \u201cI feel the Black Magnum is best on Snow Valley, sitting on top of the tower picking off opponents like they were sitting still. One beautiful shot to the skull sending the rest of their team into a panic. The best kill is in the dead silence, a shot rings out from your gun, the opponent falls dead.\u201d - Joshua P.\"Events  The Black-Magnum was available through the following events:Trivia Sounds L96A1 Arctic Wolf  The L96A1 Arctic Wolf is a cosmetic variant of the L96A1.Overview  The L96A1 Arctic Wolf features an arctic camouflage and an integrated suppressor. Its accuracy (90) is low among most snipers, but it still sees frequent use among players. It was originally very popular due to being one of the first cosmetic variants of the L96A1, and one of the few cosmetic variants at the time.Events Trivia ", "MySims Wiki": "MySims Wiki MySims Wiki  The wiki all about MySims that anyone can edit!

It was released on September the 28th, 2010 in North America, while it was released on October 1, 2010 in Europe. Its existence was confirmed when Electronic Arts filed a trademark protection for the name \"MySims SkyHeroes\" on January 26, 2010  in relation to \u201cComputer game software; Computer game software downloadable from a global computer network; Video game software\u201d. A second filing for MySims SkyHeroes covers \u201cEntertainment services, namely, providing an on-line computer game; Provision of information relating to electronic computer games provided via the Internet\u201d. EA officially announced MySims SkyHeroes to the public on May 4, 2010.  A trailer, along with several screenshots and character renders was revealed (see trailer below after the Tabs). ABC Software also listed MySims SkyHeroes for Playstation 3 and Xbox 360.  With this fact, MySims SkyHeroes was the first MySims game to date that is on a non-Nintendo console (excluding the PC and Mobile Phones). Also this is the first MySims game to contain Cameo Characters (MySims Agents had \"sim easter eggs\" of some of these characters, but they were not considered a character) with Cmdr. Shepard from the Mass Effect franchise, Elliot Salem and Tyson Rios from the Army of Two franchise, Isaac Clarke from Dead Space, Morrigan from the Dragon Age franchise, and Dusty from the Medal of Honor franchise.Official Description  Take to the sky to lead the resistance against Morcubus and his drone army and to stop his plans to take over the skyways.

The story mode missions take place on maps that range anywhere from tropical locations with volcanoes you can fly through to cityscapes with giant skyscrapers you need to avoid. There are eight kinds of power-ups and pickups that increase your speed, change what kind of projectile you fire, or inflict status ailments on your plane like flipping it upside down. You gain health by shooting down opponents. All the console versions also will be featuring online playability for the first time in a MySims game. There will be multiplayer options as well.

Starting as an unknown pilot, players fight to become a celebrated hero as they defeat dangerous enemies in aerial combat, test their reflexes in fast-paced speed challenges, and take on massive enemy bosses that demand all their skills as a pilot to survive. As you progress through the story and complete certain challenges in levels, rallying diverse types of pilots for your cause. As the story progresses, the player discovers that before they crashed, they were a member of the Chaos Pirates. As the game comes closer to the end the player works as a double agent and places a bomb in Morcubus' base, the MorcuFortress and rushes back to the SkyForce HQ where they are attacked by the Chaos Pirates.

Sims are relatively friendly, and all unique in their own way, and they love many different things. For example, Violet Nightshade likes Spooky things, while her younger sister, Poppy, loves Cute things. Most of them are bizarre, with humorous flaws and obsessions, like Dr. F the mad scientist, Rosalyn P. Marshall, who is obsessed with paperwork, Luis, the boy who's fanatic with getting a good college application, and King Roland, the kind and wise king, who loves cupcakes. They speak a \"nonsense language\" called Simlish.Sim Customization MySims  Sims can be customized in many ways. There are three skintones ; white, tan, and black. There are different eye shapes, but you can't choose the color for each shape. There are also different mouth types, including smiles, frowns, moustaches, etc. Most hairstyles have the four default colors ; black, blond, brown, and red. However, some hairstyles have an additional special color like the simple pony tail, which has a pink color. Some hairstyles also have headgear attached. You can also change your Sim's voice , with up to six voice types. Interestingly, each voice's icon is colored similarly to the six main interests; geeky, studious, tasty, cute, spooky, and fun. There are many different outfits, but you cannot choose individual tops and bottoms; you must choose from full outfits. You can also add up to two decals   to your Sim's face (such as a star or whiskers), and glasses. If you're too lazy to create your own Sim, or just bored, you can click the button with a die  on it to let the game select a random look for you. Aside from yourself, you can customize the residents of your town, using a Changing Booth or a Costume Chest. You aren't able to change the Sim's name or voice, but you can change their appearance completely, and make them look entirely different than they looked before. You are not able to dress the NPCs with the clothes available from the Mirror, since the Mirror does not have an option to let you change your friend's appearances. You can only dress up like them if they are commercial through the dresser. Changing an appearance involves clicking on the part you want to change. For example, if you want to change your Sim's eyes, you click the eyes, and the next option appears. You would just keep clicking the eyes, until you find the pair that appeals to you the most.MySims PC  Almost nothing has changed from the original MySims; some outfits and hairstyles that are similar to MySims Kingdom's style, and some outfits never seen before.MySims Kingdom  The way you change your Sim's appearance in Create-A-Sim is pretty much the same as in MySims. There are still only full outfits, and one color for each eye shape. Unlike the last game, you can select your gender, although it does not alter the game much other than having different selections of clothes, and the other characters in the game actually referring to you, according to your gender (\"she\" and \"he\"). There is one new voice type for each gender. The original voices all return in the game. Unfortunately, you can only select one face tattoo on your face, unlike the last game. There are few returning outfits from the previous game, and many new ones themed to Kingdom. When you become best friends with a Sim, you may receive their outfit and hair. There are a few special skin tones in the game, although the player cannot use them. There is an elf skin (used by Leaf and Petal), zombie skin (Zombie Carl), and an extremely pale skin (Goth Boy). In addition to special skin tones, there are some special hair colors. Some sims, such as Lyndsay and Zack, have what appears to be a \"bleach-blonde\" hair color, a slightly lighter blonde than the average blonde color. Even after recieving their outfits, you cannot unlock this \"bleach-blonde\" color.MySims Party  All of the outfits from MySims, and a few outfits from MySims Kingdom, return in MySims Party's Create-A-Sim. Sims are able to choose stats to prepare themselves for minigames throughout the game. They are Power, Speed, Stamina, and Luck. A few of the Commercial Sims' outfits have new colors (such as Buddy's new blue bellhop outfit). These new colored outfits are used when there is a festival/minigame, and one of the competitors is the same Sim, wearing the same outfit as the host. The host will have the alternate colored outfit.MySims Racing  For the main article see \"Garage\".Interests  As mentioned before, Sims like many different things. In MySims, these things that these Sims like are represented by their Interests. Sims will love one Interest, like another, but absolutely hate one Interest. Most of the time, Sims who hate an interest won't interact with a Sim who loves it, or go to their house. However, every now and then they will (ex. Poppy going in Violet's house and vice versa.). In MySims Kingdom, Interests don't play a significant role, or are as important as they were in MySims, but they still slightly represent the Sim.The Player  The player, (you) is a Sim who loves helping out other Sims. What you do will make a difference. You decide which Sims to befriend, and which Sims you just don't like. The player can also talk to the other Sims to learn more about their character, give them gifts, and interact with them, by either being nice, or mean. If you dislike a Sim, there are several ways to make them suffer. In MySims, you can take the furniture they like, be mean when interacting with them, or just kick them out of your town if they are bothering you. If the player befriends Sims, Sims will notice their friendliness. If they feel the player is being nice enough, they will feel like returning the favor, and they are bound to reward them with an outfit, or a blueprint.Becoming Friends with a Sim  The player can befriend whoever they want. In MySims, you can become friends with a Sim by giving them furniture they like in their houses, and by being nice to them. They will reward you a gift honoring you if you become their best friend. In MySims Kingdom, you can become a Sim's best friend by doing tasks for them, like building them a house, or improving an existing structure. Once you have finished all their tasks, they will most likely reward you with an outfit.Sims  Below is a list of characters in MySims, and a brief summary of who they are, or what role they have. The Sims are listed under the game they first appeared in.MySims Wii MySims PC MySims DS MySims Mobile MySims Kingdom Wii MySims Kingdom DS MySims Party MySims Racing MySims Agents MySims Agents DS MySims SkyHeroes Scrapped Sims  The following are Sims that never made their debut in the MySims series, and were scrapped or added to a later game in the series.MySims MySims Kingdom MySims Agents MySims SkyHeroes MySims  MySims, previously known by the working title The Sims Wii, is a game developed and published by Electronic Arts, as a spinoff to The Sims franchise. It was released for the Nintendo Wii, Nintendo DS, Microsoft Windows, and mobile phones. The art style and gameplay is heavily inspired by Nintendo franchises, such as Animal Crossing. This is the first game in the MySims series, and is followed by MySims Kingdom, MySims Party, MySims Racing, MySims Agents, and MySims SkyHeroes.Wii  MySims is the first main entry in the MySims Series released on September 18, 2007 for Wii and DS. MySims focuses on creating your Sim to help restore a town to its former glory.Features  Apart from creating a custom Mii-like character, players may also modify their houses, and build furniture and appliances, by using a selection of building blocks. This gives the player more building options, allowing them to create objects by using blueprints, a change from the usual virtual catalog found in The Sims. There are 80 characters, with whom the player may interact with in the Wii version (30 characters in the Nintendo DS version), such as a mad scientist, a magician, a librarian, a pizza chef, and a Sim Fu teacher. Some of these characters may ask the player to build things for them. As with previous Sim games, meeting people and forming relationships is a major gameplay focus. Becoming a Sim's best friend will earn the player either a special blueprint not available any other way in the game, or an outfit for their wardrobe. Players can also earn blueprints by performing tasks for Commercial Sims (sims who have their own businesses). Typically this involves building around 5-10 items for Sims, depending on the Star Level (rated 1-5) of the player's town, and the essences they have access to. A feature to MySims is \"Essences\". They can be found in various locations in town or by interacting with Sims or objects. Essences are used for a number of things including paint for the walls of houses, construction of items, as well as decoration for the itemsCharacter design  Compared to previous Sims titles, MySims has a more anime-inspired look, with character designs. This was Emmy Toyonaga's idea; in Official Nintendo Magazine she remarked: \"Well, Mario and other Nintendo characters are pretty short and stubby. Also, being Japanese, I'm used to the mindset that fun games should have shorter, stubbier characters. So these characters kind of came naturally.\" In Nintendo Power, designer Robin Hunicke said that the character designs also imply youthfulness, and that the aesthetic was chosen for world-wide appeal, while referring to the lesser sales of previous Sims games in Japan, compared to other territories. According to Official Nintendo Magazine, one of the Sims in MySims, Chaz McFreely, is based on their then editor, Chandra Nair.Game Aspects Characters  See also: Portal:MySims CharactersLocations  There are three main locations, and Sims can inhabit. There are also various sub-areas which you can often gather essences from.Interests  There are six interests of which the Sims will be interested in. These are: Cute, Fun, Geeky, Spooky, Studious & Tasty. Each interest also has associated essences and activities associated with them. The associated activities are: Tea Party, Dance-Off, Rocket Launch, Seance, Book Party & Picnic.Star Levels  As you progress through the game, your town's star rating will increase. Each time you gain a star, Rosalyn will give you new tools to unlock new areas, new blueprints, and new blocks to use in your Workshop.PC  As in the original MySims for the Wii console, the game allows players to develop a small town and build buildings and furniture for the growing population. The game also had the ability to host a limit of 7 other players via an Internet connection. The online feature allowed players to chat, interact and play games like Tag and Hide-and-Seek with online \"buddies\". Furthermore, it allowed players to construct buildings and create objects to use cooperatively, and to share creations in-game as well as outside the game via email or instant message, allowing other players to use the creations in their towns. Like the Wii version, Sims do not have needs or wants, but eating and sleep are optional. The controls are identical to the Wii version, but now you use the keyboard and the mouse to play the game. You use the keyboard to move your Sim around while the mouse clicks and collects essences. Also buildings can be used with both the keyboard and the mouse. You can also use the keyboard to type messages during online mode. The game was recalled from several stores for an unknown reason (possibly because it was slow for most computers or it held glitches). Alternatively, you can get an online download of MySims from the GameStop website. The game may also be brought at the EA Store. On November 26, 2011, EA shut down the online servers for the game. All online features like connecting with your friends and visiting each others' gardens are now defunct. It is still possible to visit your garden offline and there is the option to log in, but it now comes up with an error message reading: 'Could not find Back-End Server'.Features  Apart from creating a custom Mii-like character, players may also modify their houses and build furniture and appliances using a selection of building blocks. This gives the player more building options, allowing them to create objects by using blueprints, a change from the usual virtual catalog found in The Sims. There are 80 characters with whom the player may interact in the Wii version (30 characters in the Nintendo DS version), such as a mad scientist, a magician, a librarian, a pizza chef, and a martial arts teacher. Some of these characters may ask the player to build things for them. As with previous Sims games, meeting people and forming relationships is a major gameplay focus. Becoming a Sim's best friend will earn the player either a special blueprint not available anywhere else in the game, or a style of clothing for their wardrobe. Players can also earn blueprints by performing tasks for Commercial Sims (Sims who have their own businesses). Typically this involves building around 5-10 items for the townspeople, depending on the Star Level (the 1-5 level) of the player's town and the essences they have access to. A feature new to MySims is Essences. They can be found in various locations in town or by interacting with townsfolk or objects. Essences are used for a number of things including paint for the walls of houses, construction of items, as well as decoration.Special Features  MySims (PC) is a special edition of MySims, including gardens, new exclusive characters, several brand new blueprints, and more essences. Six new commercial townsfolk (1 for each interest) are found around Star Level 3. There is also a new beeping noise associated with the Prospector.Gardens  MySims (PC) includes gardens, where there are new Essences, such as Penguins. In it, you can invite your friends, build objects, and have several different lots you can build houses that you can put anything you want in it. The online works similarly to Friend Codes in Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. You must have each other registered in a roster. Each player's garden has their own exclusive essences, so you must meet with friends to collect them all.Exclusive New Characters  These are the 6 exclusive new characters available in MySims (PC). They are all commercial Sims and come in the hotel at either Star Level 3 or 4.Glitches  There is a known glitch in MySims (PC) that causes a Sim to clone themselves. The glitch is caused when a Sim is moved into town, moved out, and then moved in again. Many players find this to be helpful rather than annoying, because they can dress up the cloned Sim so they look like two different Sims, making the town seem like it is more populated than it actually is. However, the clone Sim can revert to their original clothing. If you kick out a Sim who is affected by the clone glitch, the clone comes out and walks away. Therefore, when the actual Sim comes out, you still have one in your town. This means that your town is more populated.Exclusive Essences  This is a list of the exclusive new essences included in MySims (PC) (though some can be found in future games). They are all found in the Gardens. thumb|300px|right|The MySims PC TrailerTrivia Mobile  MySims for mobile phones hosts similar gameplay to its Nintendo DS counterpart. It can be bought on certain phones and services just like any other game available on a cell phone. It has 2D graphics, unlike the 3D graphics engine of the Wii and DS versions of the game. Like the Nintendo DS version, the Mobile version of MySims hosts a variety of 6 minigames, including Fishing, Racquetball, Lei Making, Sushi, Paragliding and Skydiving.Story  In MySims for the Mobile, your town has been devastated by an extremely violent storm. You, the player, must help rebuild the town to its former glory, attract tourists, and play minigames. You are on a quest to collect six gems to supposedly help rebuild the town.Characters  The cast of characters in the Mobile version of MySims is similar to the cast of characters available in the DS version with certain characters not in game and new characters appearing. Most characters have new roles. For a full list, see the Character PortalTV Series  A MySims animated television series was set to be made and also produced by Film Roman. Not much was known as to when it will start airing. After being \"Under Production\" for so many years, it is presumed that the project was a fraud.References/Sources Story  The Player comes to a town, which the Player names, and helps Mayor Rosalyn P. Marshall bring it back to life. The Player builds his/her own house, and builds his/her own workshop. You start out working for the mayor, and furnishing the town hall. Next the player fixes up the town flower shop. After doing so, Chef Gino arrives at the hotel. You build him a restaurant, and soon, your town reaches the next star level, which unlocks more Sims to move in, and more blueprints to use. From there on, you are given the liberty to create and design your town however you like, as well as the furniture you build for your citizens to use.Features  MySims is similar to the original Sims franchise, but many things have been changed in this game. The inhabitants are now blocky, anime-style figures, instead of realistic humans, but still have their gibberish language. Unlike \"The Sims\", the characters in MySims don't have any needs like having to eat, or sleep. Another feature in this is to build virtually anything in the game, unlike The Sims where you can only build a house and decorate it.Sequels  Five sequels have currently been released for MySims. MySims Kingdom was released October 28, 2008, and MySims Party was released on the 9th of March 2009. MySims Racing was also released on June 12, 2009. Also, MySims Agents came out September 29 of 2009. MySims SkyHeroes came out September 28th, 2010.\u00a0MySims SkyHeroes\u00a0is currently the last game of the franchise.Reception  MySims has received fairly mixed, but generally decent reviews. It is known for having colorful graphics and cheery and fun gameplay, but criticized for having too much focus on construction and collecting essences. IGN said that \"The problem is that nearly all of the objectives revolve around the same two tasks: the collection of essences and the construction of houses, buildings and items. All of the Sim management and social interaction elements of the previous games \u2013 well, you're not going to find much of that in the streamlined Wii affair\". Gamespot praised the Wii game for the construction being intuitive and flexible and for the presentation being cheery and clean. It was also criticized for having longer than usual load times. Its Nintendo DS counterpart is regarded as virtually an all new game in design; However, reception of its control scheme varied greatly.Trivia See Also External Links MySims Characters  The following characters are found in MySims.See Also Portal:MySims Kingdom Characters BlankyXP GET OFF THE PONE, DOG!

Rarely seen in public, he is also rumored to be an evil wizard and was once even referred to as the Prince of Monsters. He is the main antagonist of MySims Agents and his goal is to obtain a powerful item called the Nightmare Crown.Relation to Plot  Morcubus worked on the original Nightmare Crown with Paul, Michael Gray and Cyrus Boudreaux. He got greedy and decided to use the crown for his own purposes and to rule the universe. He turns Cyrus' butler, Carl, into a zombie and Paul into a yeti with the Nightmare Crown. Paul, confused and enraged, destroyed the lab and in the struggle, Morcubus dropped the crown and fled. The player meets him on his/her very first case in the game. The player has to work out if a dog belongs to Morcubus or Poppy. Morcubus claims the dog is his and that the dog is named Killfang. After some investigation, however, it is clear that the dog actually belongs to Poppy. After the player declares the dog Poppy's, Morcubus is enraged, saying that the player has made him look like a fool. He decides that you and him are now officially enemies. He isn't seen that much from there on in the game. His disciples Esma and Brandi do most of his dirty work from then on. However, after a few cases you have solved, Morcubus realizes that you're doing a better job trying to find the Nightmare Crown, so he decides that he'll just let you find the Nightmare Crown, and then he will take it from you. After you get the Nightmare Crown from the Jungle Temple and are about to leave, you find Morcubus waiting for you at the entrance. Morcubus steals the Nightmare Crown from your hands and activates the Nightmare Crown to open the Nightmare Realm portal. Before the crown's full power is utilized, however, Evelyn nobly pushes herself and Morcubus back into the Nightmare Realm portal, leaving the world safe once again. However, you still believe it's possible to get Evelyn back to the world and you are determined to bring her back. If you complete all of the dispatch missions, it's possible to save Evelyn back from the Nightmare Realm. Once you complete all the dispatch missions, Walker asks you to send him one of your best recruit teams on one last dispatch mission with him to travel into the Nightmare Realm and get Evelyn back. At one point during the mission, Walker will text you that Evelyn and Morcubus are apparently somehow connected to each other in the realm, so if they save Evelyn, they have to save Morcubus as well. In order to rescue Evelyn successfully, you have to choose to rescue Evelyn with Morcubus. If your recruit team and Walker are successful in their mission, Evelyn will be successfully rescued, but Morcubus has apparently escaped from Walker and your issued recruit team's grasp and will probably be causing trouble once again. But for now, the world is at peace once again, and everyone agrees that they're gong to be ready if Morcubus strikes again. This points to a possible sequel.MySims SkyHeroes   Morcubus is a villain who is trying to gain control of the sky with the help of his army and the Chaos Pirates. Besides the Chaos Pirates and his vast army of MorcuBots, Morcubus hires the Fortune Hunters to capture several places, makes a truce with the Crescent Moon ninjas so he can steal all there resources and steals from the Sci-Flyers so he can use there technology for weapons like the Ragnarok. Morcubus claims very late in the game that he doesn't want to take over the sky so he can rule the world, but because he wants it for the Morcubus Day parade. He can be unlocked after getting the gold medal during the final boss fight.Missions Set by Morcubus Involving Morcubus Dialogue After Game is Completed Trivia Foreign Name MySims Kingdom  MySims Kingdom is a video game developed by EA Redwood Shores and published by Electronic Arts as a spinoff to Maxis' The Sims franchise for the Nintendo DS and Wii in 2008. MySims Kingdom is a successor to MySims, which was released in 2007 and it was successed by MySims Party and MySims Racing.Wii Prologue  Once upon a time, there was a great kingdom that covered the entire world. This kingdom was made up of many different lands...and many different Sims. All the Sims and all the lands were ruled by a kind and wise king: Me, King Roland! To help protect the people of my kingdom, I ordered my wizard to make a collection of magic scepters. I gave these special wands to the most loyal and brave Sims in the kingdom, and thus was born the Order of Wandoliers. With their magic scepters in hand, the Wandoliers could do amazing things! They used their power to protect the kingdom and keep the Sims of the world happy. It's hard to believe so much time has passed...All of the Wandoliers have long since retired or moved away. Parts of my kingdom are now falling into disrepair, and the people are not as happy as they once were. But today is a very special day! I, King Roland, will be naming a new Wandolier! Who will it be? Where will they come from? And what will they look like?New Features  The game has new features to its predecessor MySims, where there are fewer loading screens, and most of them feature interactive cutscenes. The frame has been improved for smoother animation. Item creation has been dropped and decorating a Sim's Home is done with pre-fabricated items obtained by finishing quests where you are asked to find several specific essences and trade them for scrolls, that gives you the ability to make new items. Essences are no longer needed to build or paint, instead you use \"Mana Points\" which can be obtained by performing certain activities like mining. Also the game includes a new building interface and a storyline unlike the first MySims.The Roving Wandolier  MySims Kingdom begins as good King Roland holds a contest for a new Wandolier. A Wandolier is a glorified construction worker, but garners its name from the magical scepter (or wand) that you are given to perform your duties. Unlike a construction worker, there is no heavy lifting, bag lunches, or wolf-whistling female passersby in MySims Kingdom. Everything is done with a wave of your wand. After winning the contest and a short tutorial, you are let lose in the world to work your building magic. The world of MySims Kingdom is no longer constricted to just one town. You now have a veritable cornucopia of islands to traverse and build about. Each island has its own theme and special items to build. There will be many different islands once the game is released, including Rocket Reef, Cowboy Junction and Spookane.The Essence of Construction  Like MySims, MySims Kingdom utilizes \u201cessences\u201d as the building blocks of the world. Items are built by using scrolls which are like recipe cards for the various items. A scroll will tell you what essences and how many of each you will need to construct objects, a dresser or stairs for example. Essence can be collected by shaking trees, digging up the ground or by socializing with the various island residents. Once you have collected the required essences, you can go into build mode and build your own version of the item using a blue print and a variety of geometric shapes and decorations.Characters  King Roland, Princess Butter, Marlon the Wizard, Elmira Clamp, Lyndsay, Buddy, Barney Cull Ren\u00e9e Sheriff Ginny, Chef Gino, Ol' Gabby, Rusty the Robber, Roxie Road Leaf, Proto-Makoto, Petal, Hopper Dr. F, Alexa Lexington, Vic Vector, T.O.B.O.R.

Marshall is no longer a mayor but the headmistress of a school called The Royal Academy, and her rose pin is removed as well; Ginny is a sheriff now; Buddy is the Royal Messenger, and wears breeches and similar looking clothing from the last game, but a bit different. Grandma Ruthie gets a spooky makeover after the player and Goth Boy offers to help make her have more customers (but she looks pretty much the same as her original MySims look before the makeover) and lives in Spookane in hopes of boosting cookie sales. Violet has a slightly different appearance, with her hair now up in a ponytail and a different grayish-black dress. Poppy's hair is now brown and wears a green dress instead of overalls. Morcubus has a drastically darker appearance with black hair and a new hairstyle, new eyes and a dark red suit. Goth Boy's skin is paler, but nothing else has really changed. Travis, Liberty, and Summer are now wearing school uniforms. Liberty, however, does not have a band-aid on her nose anymore and her skin is white now. Chaz McFreely has retained his previous appearance of the dim-witted daredevil, and for some reason, isn't wearing any uniform and still is wearing his original outfit. Roxie Road no longer wears her bee suit, but now wears a milk maid dress with bee stripes at the end of her sleeves and dress, but still keeps the antennae, and her hair is now brown as well. Vic Vector now wears a janitor outfit, but after building the rocket in Rocket Reef is wearing an astronaut suit. Elmira is no longer a librarian, but a peasant and pig farmer and wears an old looking ragged dress, although she keeps the same pencils in her hair. Both Linda and Gordon are wearing different clothing to blend in with the \"atmosphere\" of Trevor Island. Makoto is in her prototype form. Trevor Verily still retains his previous appearance. Hopper rowed to the Forest of the Elves and now lives there, where he has made some friends with a couple of frogs and where he is finding his \"inner frog\". Chef Gino lives on Cowboy Junction and makes his pizza there. His outfit is not noticeably altered, but if you look carefully, he does not have checkered pants anymore and his top is slightly altered as well.Animals  This is a new concept in the game. There are now animals in the game. They include pigs, bunnies, raccoons, dogs, cats, bears, cubs, frogs, unicorns, hedgehogs, spiders,prarie dogs, and a triceratops named Bobaboo.Islands Reception  It was nominated for Best Simulation Game for the Wii by IGN in its 2008 video game awards.External Links DS   The DS version of MySims Kingdom takes place on an island in King Roland's oceanic kingdom.Plot  The adventure starts as King Roland and the mayor of the island town, Ellen, are chatting. King Roland believes that the town is progressing well and that Ellen is doing an excellent job running as mayor. Ellen thanks King Roland, and then you come into the room. Ellen greets you and welcomes you back to town. You were at a resort on another island, but you just came back home to town. You and King Roland greet each other. After King Roland leaves, Ellen becomes frantic, as she can't find your house keys that you had given her when you went on vacation. Since Ellen can't find your keys, she gives you a new key. Once you find your house, you go to sleep in your bed. In the middle of the night, a man in black is seen sucking everything from town using some kind of contraption, including buildings, flower beds, and everything that made the town prosper. The next morning, Ellen is mortified and shocked at the sudden disappearance of everything that made up the town. Many of the residents have left the town, and many important structures (such as the gondola to travel up the mountains) are missing. King Roland unfortunately comes back and see the mess. He demands Ellen to fix everything back up. Ellen desperately asks for your help. Your adventure involves you trying to get the island town back to its former glory as well as finding the villain responsible for the crime. You improve the town and get it back up by playing minigames such as Kayaking, Stargazing, and Balloon Present; and by placing decoratives around town and make the town look lively and beautiful again. Meanwhile, as you improve the town, clues are revealed and you unravel scenes in the story that will eventually lead you to the identity of the criminal.Trailers and Commercials Commander Shepard   Commander Shepard appears in MySims SkyHeroes as a playable pilot.

You first meet Poppy at Gino's Pizzeria, where she comes to speak with you, a local detective. She tells you that a bad man stole her dog, Dogwood. You make your way to the park where the scene of the crime was. When you get there, Morcubus tells you that Dogwood is his and that his name is Killfang. With both characters claiming that the dog is theirs, you must investigate and see which person is the real owner. Poppy claims that she has the dog's favorite toy, a pink ball, but she lost it and you must scour the park for it. Morcubus claims that the dog loves bones, but after proving him wrong, you find out that the only reason the dog was hanging near Morcubus was because there was some jerky nearby which the dog was attracted to. The dog is returned to Poppy and she is happy again, although Morcubus swears revenge on you. A man named Walker notices your detective work and offers something special for you... Poppy later returns as a minor figure in the whole mystery surrounding the Nightmare Crown and the disappearance of Michael Gray. You find Poppy and Dogwood in the forest while investigating the ransacking of Evelyn Gray's house. Poppy says that Derek gave Dogwood some jewelry to dig, and then you have to dig up all the wholes to find all the stolen jewelry and a unexpected friend. Later on, the SPA discovered the jewel needed to power the Nightmare Crown, Fortunite, was presently located in the Boudreaux Mansion, and it turns out Poppy's parents were friends with the dead owner, Cyrus Boudreaux. The jewel was going to be given away to someone as written in Cyrus' will. The only way to get to the mansion is by invitation and, along with her sister, Violet Nightshade, Poppy was sent an invitation. You ask for the invitation, but it turns out Poppy hasn't gotten her mail in three months. It turns out that Derek was hired by Morcubus to steal all the mail being sent to citizens on Main Street. You confront Derek, who reveals he discarded the letters. After exploring the forest, you realize that Poppy's letters was taken by a bird and used to make nests around the town. You eventually find Poppy's invitation in a bird's nest and she allows you to use it, thus granting you access to the party. But when you ask why she decided not to go, Poppy reveals that her sister told her that their might be some bad people at the party. Poppy offers a dispatch mission later asking for help finding her stolen float for the Citywide Flower Parade. Turns out, some creepy not-of-this-world cult from the Forest Park stole it so they could use it to destroy most of the forest, but after a confrontation, the float was rescued and given to Poppy.Dispatch Missions The Sadness Parade  Description- Hi -player name-!

She will not appear unless a spooky resident, such as Cassandra or Ray, performs a s\u00e9ance. She will want to play numerous times and loves to scare you. She will often pop up behind you, scare you, hug you, tease you and also tickle you. She will also float around the area of the large fountain in your town and try to scare or tickle any other townsfolk who come by. Cassandra can sometimes disappear randomly while interacting with her, or at any time at all, so you will have to have another spooky person perform another seance if you want her to appear again, or you may have to search around town, as she may have just disappeared somewhere else. You can't move her into your town, but she'll give you three special blueprints if you become best friends with her. This can be hard at times either because she won't stay long enough, or she will scare your sim and subtract points. However, even if you do succeed in being best friends with her, she will not appear in your relationship book. The reason for this is because when you the player speak to a sim for the first time they are registered in your relationship book, due to Cassandra's unique nature she does not have a Talk option and thus cannot be added to a player's relationship book. She has purple hair in a short spiked style and small bunny ears. Nothing is known about Cassandra's background, or the cause of her death.Profile  OOOOOOOOOOOOOoooooooooooooooooooOOOOOOOO! ooooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOoooooooooooooo!Interests Loves  spookyLikes  StudiousHates  Fun Note: Neither her profile nor do her interests appear ingame.

The contest has been held every year since 2008 except in 2010, when it suffered an hiatus process for troubles with the Organization. The current Miss Sim Universe is Alejandra Garrido, from Mexico.History  Miss Sim Universe was aired for first time in Summer 2008, in missimworld Channel on YouTube. It was founded by\u00a0J.K at age of fifteen. The idea of this young men from Spain was to make a different show with Sims. He tried a year\u00a0before to make another sims beauty pageant called Miss Sim World thus of the Channel on YouTube). The first edition of this contest was very succesfull, it has more than 20 delegates and finally Nashira Galistera from Turkey was crowned Miss Sim World 2007. One year later he tried to do it again, but the fame of the contest dissapeared, nobody sent sims... so he forgot the idea of a Beauty Pageant for sims. Several months later he decided to try it again, to make a beauty contest but with everything made by him: the delegates, the stage, the runways... He did it and it was so sucesfull, the people loved to watched it and it had more than 8,000 visits to date. A year leater he did again and the people received it with hand open, it had 8 more delegates and 50,000 of share. Now it has become in one of the most waited shows along YouTube, it has become so international and famous. Third edition was waited to be broadcasted in Summer 2010, but due to technical problems and trouble with the organization the contest suffered one year hiatus. In 2011 it was announced that the contest was going to have a new president: Rodolfo Mendieta from Mexico, who already owned the Miss Sim Mexico Pageant, so J.K, MSU's creator, left the contest after 3 years and 2 editions.

As a member of his race, he does his part by abducting Sims, and making sure that the Alien\\Sim Hybrid population is flourishing smoothly.Biography Early Life  Pollination Technician was born on the home planet, Graslax, to a Colony Drone, and a Birth Queen. It's presumed PT9 never knew his parents, as he has no memories of his parents, or any other family. He was presumably trained as a Pollination Technician on Graslax, and later traveled to different planets, even visiting Earth.Pollination Career  Since he did only one pollination in his entire life, it's presumed that there's extensive practice and training that could take up to nearly 30 to 40 Sim years to complete. He would finally pollinate Glarn Curious during his life. Glarn would later give birth to twins, Chloe Smith, and Lola Smith.Pre-Strangetown, here we come  Pollination Technician 9 would later meet different alien hybrids, see how they're treated, and see if they have good enough genetics to save the Graslaxian race. He would do this and meet Jayne Doe.

This cycle will be the first in SNTM history to feature a co-ed cast, introducing male contestants into the mix. The semi finalists are in the process of being released in groups. So far two groups have been revealed, the amount of semi finalists yet to be revealed is unknown.Ann Futa  The oldest daughter of Livia and Garth Walker, Ann Walker is a free-spirited art and nature lover. She has always been a little eccentric.Biography  Ann's closest childhood friends were Marsha Bruenig and Chloe Gonzaga. She loved art, and spent a lot of time at the local community center drawing and sewing potholders. Her family had some money trouble when she was young, and sometimes they didn't know where their next meal was coming from. Garth couldn't seem to hold a steady job, and Livia had trouble getting back into the workforce after having a child. But love and strong family ties kept them together. In high school, Ann won several scholarships for academics, dancing, and art. Her younger sister Natalya was born, and they became very close. Ann met Alvin Futa, who would become her first boyfriend. They dated for a while and had their very first kiss together. She also befriended her younger classmates Brittany Parker and Sophie Miguel. Ann went to college at Mount Greenlake University, with plans of becoming a doctor. Rose Brunswick, the daughter of the Walkers' grouchy next-door neighbor Evelyn Brunswick, was in the same dorm with her. It was nice to have a familiar face around, and they quickly became friends. However, during her sophomore year, Rose was electrocuted while trying to fix a stereo and died, despite the University Hospital's best efforts to save her. This event profoundly affected Ann. She lost faith in the medical profession and dropped out of her program. For a while, she was unsure of what to do with herself. Then she met Darren LeTourneau, a serious young man who was interested in robotics and the creation of artificial life. This led him to contemplate the definition of life itself, and eventually conclude that the \"vital spark\" is greater than the sum of its parts. Ann latched on to this idea and found new purpose: she planned to study holistic medicine and become a spiritual healer. Meanwhile, she perfected her art skills and began selling some of her paintings. Soon she started dating Darren. He fell deeply in love with her, but she wasn't as serious about him, absorbed as she was in her new field of study. Her college days sailed by as she danced, painted, made new friends... and became more and more obsessed with the paranormal. She became a believer in UFOs and contemplated the possibility that aliens were the origin of life on Earth (to the chagrin of her devoutly Catholic mother.) Her closest companions were Adriana Curtin, Clay Vijayakar, Amy Jones, and Colby Wilkie. She went on one date with Clay, but they decided it was better just to be friends. Meanwhile, she and Darren had hit a rough patch because he was afraid she was too obsessed with the past and was letting Rose's tragic death ruin the rest of her life. Though he tried to express his concerns gently, Ann was very defensive and they argued frequently. Right before graduation, Ann was reunited with Alvin, who had returned from studying abroad. They soon found that they still had feelings for one another. After sharing a kiss with Alvin, Ann told Darren she couldn't see him any more. He was crushed and very jealous, believing that Ann had cheated on him, though they had never been in an official committed relationship. They didn't speak to each other for a long time afterward. Ann later tried to make it up to him by setting him up with Alvin's ex, Brandi, but it didn't work out because Darren and Brandi turned out to be second cousins. Ann graduated with high honors, moved into a house in the suburbs, and married Alvin. He took a job at a construction company and paid most of the bills, while she was an acupuncturist and amateur painter by day, faith healer and medium by night. She started to research the use of acupuncture and herbal medicine to help stroke victims. It was then that Evelyn revealed that Rose was not dead, but in a coma with severe brain damage. She had hidden the fact that Rose was alive for over four years because she didn't want her new boyfriend pressuring her to take Rose off life support. Now she was running out of money, and begged Ann to help her. Ann vowed to save Rose, and now it was Alvin's turn to worry about her. Ann's effort to revive Rose brought her into conflict with her friend Brittany's husband, Dr. Alon Livingston, a stubborn, by-the-book surgeon who dismissed Ann as a quack. He had plans to attempt a highly experimental surgery that could heal Rose... or kill her. On the night of the procedure, Livia, Darren, and Rose's sister Salvia held a prayer vigil at the Walker home. At the hospital, things were not going well, and Rose's heart stopped on the operating table. With Evelyn's help, Ann bypassed hospital security and interrupted the surgery, demanding that Alon give her a chance to save her friend. Alon had her thrown out, and she and Evelyn were arrested and fined for their actions. Alon managed to stabilize Rose, but the surgery seemed to be a failure as she never regained consciousness. At the end of his rope (and thanks to a tirade from Brittany,) Alon had a sudden change of heart and decided to let Ann have a chance. Ann determined that Rose's qi was out of balance and started to treat her with traditional Chinese medicine, while Livia continued to pray. Incredibly, four days later Rose woke up. Alon determined that the surgery's effects must have been delayed, while Ann insisted it was her alternative medicine and Livia pointed to the power of God. Though they never could agree on the reason for Rose's revival, everyone was glad to have her back--especially Darren, who would later fall in love with her. News of the miracle spread, and people from everywhere traveled to seek healing from Ann. She soon found herself the unwilling head of a cult. Shortly afterward, Ann announced that she was pregnant with her and Alvin's first child. It was a boy, and they named him Garth after Ann's father. When her child was born, Ann went into hiding to escape her followers, some of whom had become quite fanatic and elevated her to a quasi-goddess status. This made Ann very uncomfortable, and it wasn't the life she wanted for her family. She appeared before them once more, and left them with a single message: \"Think for yourselves.\" Then she disappeared entirely from the public eye, and she and Alvin went on to raise their son in peace. Just after Garth turned thirteen, the Futas decided to adopt another child. Her name was Caryl, and she was a year younger than Garth. Caryl was hesitant to trust them at first, since she had spent several years in the custody of an abusive foster family. But she gradually warmed to Ann, though it would be many more years before she could get over her fear of men and fully trust Alvin. Ann taught her new daughter to paint and sculpt. They also bonded over their shared love for music. Alvin had taken up stargazing as a hobby, and the four of them spent many summer nights hunting for constellations. The family also got a dog named Balin, who would become Caryl's best friend. Ann and Alvin thought two children was the perfect number, but fate had other plans. One night while stargazing, Alvin saw a strange blue light in the sky. Before he knew what was happening, he was caught in a tractor beam and pulled into a spaceship. He was missing all night and most of the following day before the \"visitors\" unceremoniously deposited him on the front lawn. Ann was astonished, and a little jealous, when he told her he had been abducted by aliens. Caryl and Garth were afraid to go outside. No one else believed them... but soon there was no room for doubt. A few months later, Alvin collapsed with terrible stomach pains and had to be taken to the hospital. In a stroke of irony, it was Dr. Livingston who performed the emergency surgery to remove what they thought was an intestinal blockage. Instead, it turned out to be a baby. The black-eyed, green-skinned infant was the hybrid son of Alvin and an alien scientist, a result of the strange experiments they had perfomed on him. Alvin took the baby home and declared his intention to raise him. Needless to say, things were a bit weird between Ann and Alvin for the next few months. Ann found it hard to cope with the idea that her husband was the mother of someone else's child. But eventually she grew to think of the baby, who they named Leonard, as her own son. Leonard and Caryl had a healthy sibling rivalry, and things were always lively at their house. Ann went back to work, this time as a doctor at Rosario Hospital, to Alon's dismay. As Leonard grew up, Ann found more time for her art, and also became an avid gardener. She started a fruit orchard in their back yard... and it was then that she began to change. Long-term exposure to a powerful mutagenic pesticide somehow caused her to develop plant-like characteristics. Continuing in the Futa family tradition of weirdness, she underwent a strange transformation, becoming a Plantsim. Alvin had trouble coming to terms with the fact that his wife now had leaves for hair and preferred to photosynthesize rather than eat or sleep. But Ann's other friends and family members were fascinated. Garth was upset at first, but changed his mind after Ann produced a cloud of feel-good pheremones that put him into a state of euphoria. Not long after, she discovered another ability: parthenogenesis. Alvin was not particularly happy with this development, but felt he had little right to object after his alien-baby fiasco. He tried to bond with the new baby girl, who Ann named Daphne, but their relationship was strained at best.Simseriesmaker Cycle 4  The 4th cycle of Sims Next Top Model, made by simseriesmaker has started and is now up to it's 9th epsisode.

Though Candi was introduced as a minor character, she has climbed the ranks and now serves as the series main heroine. Candi's most notable styline has been her consistantly turbulant relationship with Jasper Centowski, as well as her bitter rivalry with Amanda Campbell.Storyline  In the beginning, Candi is a teenager living with her divorced mother, Alicia Cabot. Her father and mother have split and he left town. Candi has just become a teenager and is starting highschool. She spends a great deal of time trying to mend her mother's broken heart instead of having her own fun. When she does begin school she is met with harsh ridicule from the school's queen bee/biatch Natasha Vern, who is dating the star athelete James Person. Candi quickly becomes infatuated with James and tries to win him over. He later tells her that he is attracted to Candi but that if he left Natasha for her she would make both their lives a living hell. Candi then comes up with a plan to win over James. With his confessed attraction she attempts to make him jealous to the point where he will ahve to leave Natasha. She then finds a boy she believes she could never fall in love with. So she asks out the school's techno whiz and geek, Jasper Centowski, he happily accepts and they begin \"dating.\" Eventually her relationship with Jasper does make James jealous to the point where he pulls Candi aside and passionately kisses her but tells they just can not happen. This angers her and she contonues to flaunt her relationship with Jasper infront of James and Natasha. She then begins to feel guilty when Jasper tells Candi that she was his first kiss and that she has been the only ray of light in his life since the death of his mother. Natasha's father then has a job re-location and she proceeds to dump James, finally allowing him and Candi to be together. However, when the time comes Candi can't bring herself to dump Jasper and realizes that she has indeed fallen in love with the school nerd. She is un-sure though and she and James have a few make out sessions before she tells him that she wants to be with Jasper, to James discontent. James then proceeds to beat on Jasper at school, which seems to only bring him and Candi closer. James then exposes Candi's initial plan to Jasper and he dumps her figuring she was still simply using him. Candi then sinks into a depression and is heart broken. After meeting her mother's new beau, Ted Swirl, he pays James a visit and tells him to make things right, which he does. Jasper and Candi then reconcile and are caught making out by Alicia. Jasper then invites Candi to have dinner with him and his father, Hank, and she agrees. However, at dinner Hank begins poking fun at Candi because he knows that she met Jasper at first by simply using him. She then leaves in tears. She and Jasper conclude that his mean-ness is due to Jasper's mother, Wilma's, death. When her aunt, Catherine Andrews, returns she and Jasper decide to set her up with Hank. However, she lies to Candi and tells her that she still loves her homosexual ex-husband, Reggie Andrews. Candi and Jasper then hear that Mae McBride and Escobar Reyes have just recently divorced. They then decide that Mae would be great for Hank. They begin plotting but their plotting becomes un-necessary when they go to the Centowski home one afternoon and catch Hank and Mae having coffee. Candi and Jasper then go tell Escobar this and pray he will dump her. Their plan works and Escobar and Mae end their relationship. Afterward though, Candi begins to feel some slight remorse. She is then shocked when she learns from her mother that her long absent father, John Cannery, has returned to town. She asks Jasper to be her date to her aunt Cathy's wedding to William Halcoyn. When the wedding is ruined and Catherine's past revealed her mother and Ted whind up marrying and Candi recieves a new step-father. Her and Jasper's plan to get Hank happy, backfires when he becomes too cling with Mae, too fast. It actually results in her and Escobar getting back together and Hank turning his grief and fury on Jasper and announces they are moving... out of town. However, Jasper retruns and claims he has emancipated himself, which is a lie. While at home with Candi one evening he breaks down in her arsma dn claims that his father had a mental breakdown and abandoned him so he cma eback here. He spends the night at the Swirl's, but doesn't sleep with Candi. Candi then gets her mother to have Cassidy Free, help out with getting Jasper emancipated, she tells he can't because his father is still alive. She then instead adopts Jasper as her son. Candi is present at an intervention for her aunt, where she learns she has a cousin named Franky Werner. She and Jasper then have a love filled relationship. Candi then puts the love on hold when she begins to realize that she and Jasper were responsible for his father's breakdown and abandonment. She tells this to her then step-father, Ted Swirl, who instead of telling Alicia (fearing it would ruin her and Mae's friendship) decides to keewp the secret between them. Later Mae and Escobar would returns and asks Candi why she did it. She tells them the plan and Ted promises Mae he'll tell Alicia, but he doesn't. Eventually Alicia does learn of the ordeal from Mae, but no damage is done to their friendship and she is fairly understanding on Ted and Candi, which makes Ted suspicious. It is then revelaed to Candi's disgust that Alicia had been having an affair with her father, John. Ted leaves Alicia and thus leaves Candi to pick up the pieces of her mother's shattered life. Candi eventually comes around to the fact that her mother and father are giving their relationship another shot and she and Jasper quickly befriend new negihbor Chloe Talbot, daughter of Donna Talbot. However, Candi begins to notice that Chloe is perhaps too friendly with Jasper and tells him about it, he proceeds to tell her that he is only in love with her (Candi). Their relationship is then tested when after the wedding of Mae and Escobar the three all ahng out and Candi goes home, leaving Jasper and Chloe alone, and Jasper and Chlo, in a moment of weakness, make out. Jasper, guilt ridden, tries to tell Candi, but is silenced by Chloe. Candi then becomes suspicious herself and asks Chloe if anythng is going on when Chloe tells her she needs to speak to Jasper, she has her answer and the two break up on the day they were to age together. Candi goes home and is consoled by her parents and ages into a young adult. Jasper also ages and thanks his adoptive mother, Cassidy, for everything and takes a job at a science lab... out of town. Candi then takes a job in journalism and is instantly hired by Rosanna Halcoyn, who is blinded by her love for Arnold Werner. Candi then meets the station's free lance writer, Luke Donovan, whose crass and bluntness appear to annoy Candi, but secretly it's what attaracts her to him. Though they have a contrasting relationship they eventually confront their feelings for each other. However, Candi still had trust issues resulting in her break up with Jasper, but Luke is patient and as time passes they begin to date and even fall in love. Alicia becomes increasingly aware of her daughter's adult hood as she begins tp spend nights over at Luke's. When Luke manages to get proof that Mary Ann Werner initially married Winston Halcoyn, simply for his money he intends to publish the story, to Candi's chargin. This causes a slight rift between the two but they get over it. As they go through their brief rift, they must deal with the death of their boss, Rosanna Halcoyn and Candi is then informed that her father has re-married to Karen Collins. This happens just as her grand-mother, Frances Cabot, comes by for a visit as The Sun-Crest Killer, begins to stalk the residents of Sun-Crest Point. Candi, along with her cousin Franky, are the only members of the Cabot family that are un-aware that Franny is actually the killer. Before her grand-mother leaves town, she kills John in a house fire and attempted to Kill Karen as well, twice. This causes Candi to fall on Luke completely for support and he is there for her. Candi then learns that Karen is pregnant with John's child and her half-sibling. Candi promises to be in the child's life and will there if Karen needs anything. During John's late and small funeral Candi speaks about her father and how he wasn't the best dad, he was the greatest. When she goes home with Luke that night he admits to her that his sarcastic front is due to his own father's death and that Candi has managed to melt his cold heart, Luke then asks Candi to marry him and she instantly accepts. She then begins to plan their wedding with the assistance of her mother. During this time Luke becomes pre-coccupied with finding The Sun-Crest Killer, and manages to get in on the case when he persuades Chris McCain. Candi tells herself that he is just trying to get a big scoop but soon the story consumes him and their relationship becomes strained and out of no where he suggestes they drop their elaborate plans and elope, and Candi agrees. Upon their return Luke goes right back into the case leaving Candi alone and depressed. She welcomes back her old friend, Chloe Harper, and informs her of her mother's condition after looking into the families past. She quickly notes that Chloe and her new husband, Brad Harper, have a cold and almost scheduled relationship. She goes as far to ask if Chloe simply married Brad because she was pregnant. Chloe denies both accusations. Candi would later confront Luke about his obsession with the Sun-Crest Killer, he claims to love her but that this is something he must do, until there is nothing more to lead on. Candi tries to accept this but just can't she tells Luke he has a week to come to terms with this case and close it or else she will leave him as she wants a husband not a crime buff. Luke agrees to this deal and begins to go through all his data and follows up on all the leads he has, and he concludes that the killer's DNA would still be on the tampered jukebox, at the community center. One night as Candi goes to see Ted, Luke sneaks across the police tape to examine the jukebox. However, it is revealed that the jukebox was not successfully disarmed and Luke recieves a fatal electric shock and is killed. Candi is devestated by his death and becomes increasingly erratic. Luke's will stipulates his only desire for her is for her to be \"happy.\" Just then Candis old flame, Jasper, makes his epic return to Sun-Crest Point. Candi is shocked to see Jasper, who reveals that he did not return by choice but that he is back to help re-build the town's failing science branch. He and Candi finally make ammends for their failed relationship. Candi then horrificaly learns that Jasper is engaged to her new arch enemy, Amanda Campbell. Jasper then spends more time with Candi and consoles over the death of her husband. She is shocked when her mother announces that she has re-married Ted, this event plus Jasper's engagement cause her to finally admit that her husband is dead to her cousin, Franky Werner, after trying to put it out of her mind. After Amanda is confronted by an emotional Catherine, she calls off her engagement to Jasper realizing that he and Candi are still in love with each other. But Amanda confronts Candi as well telling her that revenge is a bitch and that the next time around she will not be so nice. Candi and Jasper then reconcile their friendhsip which quickly shifts once more to a relationship when they spend the night together. They then begin anew and Candi becomes happy once again. Their new relationship is then tested when Janet Brigham comes to town and it is revealed that she and Jasper had a one night stand when he first arrived in the town he moved to. Janet at the time was dating Kevin McCain, but their relationship was dissolving due to his infidelity. Janet would become pregnant there soon after and have a son, Craig. It then becomes obvious that either Kevin or Jasper are the father of Craig. This causes emotional turmoil for Candi and Jasper. They then decide to have a paternity test done and Candi si present when it is done by Reggie at the hospital along with her mother and Janet's father, Saul Brigham, who is dating Alicia. The test then proves that Jasper is the boys biological father. This causes Candi to fall into the arms of James Person, who she had just recently ran into on her way to the hospital. In a vulnerable state the two of them would spend one night together, while still technically with Jasper. Candi becomes increasingly upset with herself for what she did and the following day she thinks she is coming down with something and goes to the hospital and is examined by a recently divorced Reggie who reveals that she is pregnant. She admits that she knows the father is indeed James and not Jasper, which causes him to leave her citing that unlike her he didn't know he had a child. This causes Candi to have an emotional breakdown yet again and her mother's engagement to Saul Brigham doesn't help the situation and she freaks when she sees Jasper and Janet are \"trying\" to be a family. She isn't psyched at having Janet as well as Audrey and Lucy as step-sisters and urges her mother to marry for love not to help Saul's career. Soon Alicia sees this, as well as Candi freaking out at the sight of Jasper and Janet kissing and calls off the wedding and her relationship with Saul. Candi soon finds strength in the child she is caring and grows to loveit and she accepts James's presence in her life as well. Then on the night Lila and Marylin return and Roxy leaves Candi, while out with James, goes into labor. James gets her to the hospital and Monica Bremmer delivers their healthy daughter, Alexa, as Maurice, Reggie and Kevin were at the party. She and James get on good terms but it is clear James wishes to pursue a relationship and Candi doesn't. During this time Jasper and Janet's relationship collapses when Janet sees how Jasper still carries a torch for Candi and they break up. Jasper and Candi then once more reconcile, with James and Janet conspiring against them. They try to drive them apart by pretending to date. Though this freaks Jasper and CAndi out, they remain united. Janet and JAmes quickly realize that they can not truly ever destroy the love Jasper and Candi have each other. Janet then decides to end their charade but James says that if he and Janet were to have a kid together, it would definitley drive a wedge between Jasper and Candi. Instead if agreeing, Janet becomes disgysted that James would bring a child intoa love less union. She ends their act and tells him to get out. Realizing he has been once again defeated by Jasper, James tells Candi he will be leaving to go onto another expedition/adventure. He then learns that Jasper has asked Candi to marry him and she accepted. He offers his congratualtion, says goodbye to Alexa and leaves. Candi and Jasper decide to move their wedding up to the night of the mayoral election. Alicia and Ted return for the wedding and announce their own engagement and that they have adopted a child, David, together. Even though everything is planned and in place... Amanda, hellbent on Candi's un-happiness, kidnaps Candi and gets them stranded across town. Amanda manages to get a hold of Derwood to come get them but, it takes him a while. During their wait Amanda and Candi hash out their past and once again Candi asks Amanda what she did to make her loathe her so much. Before she can honestly answer, Derwood arrives and manages to get them all to the wedding on time. Candi and Jasper then marry in a lovely ceremony. Just as their wedding day seems to be back on track... Jasper's father, Hank, shows up at the reception. Though it is awkward to have a \"cured\" Hank back, Jasper welcomes his father back into the fold. However, Candi becomes suspicious of Hank's behavior but, becomes sidetracked when she learns that she and Jasper are expecting a baby. With the news of her pregnancy, Candi is appraoched by Derwood Halcoyn, and he asks for her help in un-covering what it was that Lila had on Amanda. At first, Candi is resistant, not wanting to help her arch foe. Alas, when Derwood convinces her it may end their bitter rivalry, a pregnant Candi travels with Derwood to the Far East and meets up with Lila. Lila, repenting for her wicked ways, tells Candi and Derwood that Amanda was once married before to a man named Herb Colson, together they had a daughter, Cara, whom Mandy abandoned. When they return Amanda's life is shattered as Travis leaves her and Derwood ends their affair. Candi then goes into labor and gives birth to her and Jasper's daughter, Viviane \"Vivi\" Centowski. Then, seeing how broekn Amanda is, Candi extends the hand of friendship to her and, the two almost become friends and with Candi's encouragement Amanda reaches out to her own daughter. Yet, when Amanda learns of Candi's hand in her exposure, she resumes their rivalry and vows revenge upon Candi. Following Vivi's birth, Candi then enters into a period of depression, where she fantisizes about being with another man. She becomes attracted to pseudo villain, George Snyder but, when she learns Blake is Jasper's half-brother and, that Hank was a pawn in Blake's schemes, she bounces backl and becomes available to her husband. She then focues her efforts on her husband and children as she becomes the editor in chief of the news station, following Mona's departure, making Candi Amanda's boss. Amanda then decides to strike back at Candi and Jasper by marrying Blake and, by doing gets him released from jail. Though Amanda only intends for her marriage to Blake to annoyt the Centowski's, Blake intends to kill them. When they marry, Candi learns that she and Jasper are expecting yet another child. This news also prompts the return of Janet eho comes to warn Candi and Jasper that Blake has intent to harm those close to Jasper, Janet then takes Alexa, Vivi and, Craig away for a brief stint to ensure their safety. Blake then plots to separate Candi and Jasper on the evening of Winston and Mona's third wedding, knowing everyone will be up at Halcoyn Hill. He manages to do so and attacks a very pregnant Candi, leaving her and the baby for dead. However, Amanda learns of Blake's plan and, comes running with Derwood in tow. They come across Candi as the Grim Reaper appears before her body. While Amanda and Derwood do this, Candi awakens in limbo, similar to Mae did. However, Candi only encounter's her first husband, Luke. While elated to see him again and declaring how she thinks the afterlife with him is truly her fate, Luke rebukes it and declares that Jasper is Candi's real soulmate and makes her give life another chance. Though it takes some convincing from Derwood, Amanda ultimately comes to her arch enemies aid and, with the death flower Travis gave her, she manages to save Candi, who is then revived, along with the child. Following her revival, she is in bad shape and, goes into labor. Derwood takes Candi to the hospital, while Amanda goes after Blake. However, during this time, Blake and Jasper had engaged in a fight at the beach. Both fought until the bitter end and, went under the water, to not emerge. As jasper and Blake are presumed dead, Candi gives birtht to twins, whom she names Holden and Francine. She is devestated by Jasper's death but, is surprised when she learns that it was Amanda who saved her and her children from certain death, leading them to form a tentative truce. Following Jasper's death Candi becomes depressed, as Craig helps her with the twins and Vivi, the two share an awkward kiss with Candi declaring she was seeing Jasper in Craig, and the vow to never speak of it again. After a while Candi is encouraged to start dating again and begins dating George Snyder. However, nothing really comes of their relationship as Candi continues to grieve and George is nursing a broken heart over Janet. They amicably break up and Candi decries that she can never really love again, but then meets Lazlo Grinaldi, a significantly younger man. The two develop a friendship and Candi is surprised when he asks her out. Initially she rejects his offer, thinking of Jasper and their age difference. However, Amanda tells Candi that she can't really set a limit on love and convinced that Lazlo could make her happy, despite knowing her past and having four children, she accepts his offer and the two go on a whirlwind date. They quickly fall in love with each other. and over a ten storyline romance, Lazlo proposes. Candi happily accepts and the two are married, with minimal problems. A day following their wedding Candi is shocked to find herself pregnant for a fourth time. Despite her concerns about her age, everyone else is happy for the couple. The pair have some trouble during the pregnancy with a teenage, Vivi, but when she asks to go to boarding school, Lazlo convinces Candi to let her. Candi then gives birth to a son, Aristotle \"Ari\" Grinaldi. They two are happy and then Candi visits Jasper and Luke's grave telling them of her life now, when a ghostly vision of Luke appears to her, he remarks how happy he is for her and when she asks if Jasper is happy on the other side, she is blown away when Luke tells her that Jasper is with him because he is not dead. Luke then disappears and Candi goes into a state of confusion. She confides in Amanda who tells her that she is sure Blake and Jasper are both dead.Relationships  Candi has been married five times, to four men. Candi has five children, and two step-children.", "MS Elegante Wiki": "MS Elegante Wiki Link (Majora's Mask)  Link is known as the legendary Hylian hero called the Hero of Time, but really, he's a (mostly) normal, good-hearted, fun-loving 11 year old kid. Or, well... as normal a kid can be after living as an adult for a year trying the save the world, and then re-living the same 3 days over and over trying to save the world again. Both this Link and the previous OoT Link were played by Amanda. Although OoT is far more classic and well-loved a game than MM, after Amanda dropped OoT Link, she decided to do something different with him if she was going to bring him back. Thus, we get awesome mask-wearing ball of strength little Link.Fanony-things  Here's some basic things about my Link you should know, especially if you aren't too familiar with Link's canon (omg go play the N64 Zeldas NAOOOOO):Background The Hero of Time  Amanda has a bad tl;dr habit concerning Zelda. To remedy this, please just refer to Ocarina of Time @ Wikipedia.Changing the Future  When he awoke, he was back in the Lost Woods, before Ganondorf had began to pursue the Triforce. At first, he was happy, but he quickly realized that he could no longer relate to the simple, innocent Kokiri, and that he was longing for the outside world that he had protected and come to love. Morover, Ganondorf was still alive and well at this time - and probably still plotting to kill the Royal Family and take the Triforce. Knowing his job as the Hero of Time was still not over, he left the forest to go to the castle and warn the King and Princess Zelda. After sneaking into the castle again, he explained to the King and Zelda that he was the Hero of Time, returned from the future, and recounted his entire struggle against Ganondorf. To finally convince the skeptical King, Link showed him the Triforce of Courage, still embedded in his hand, and all doubts were erased. Indeed, the Triforce of Wisdom had somehow entered Princess Zelda's hand as well. Link reasoned that Ganondorf must also already have the Triforce of Power, and that his plans must be stopped before he realized he had it. Ganondorf was summoned to the castle, and after an investigation, it was found that he actually did have the Triforce of Power. Moreover, Link's accusations were true - the Gerudo King really was planning to storm the castle and steal the Triforce. The King sentenced him to be executed at the Arbiter's Grounds in the desert wastelands... but Link did not like this at all. Despite being the accuser, he begged the King to spare Ganondorf's life and settle for a more lenient punishment. After all, Ganondorf was only caught, he hadn't actually done any of it yet. The Gerudo King was just another person Link had wanted to save from the dim future ahead. After hearing the news that Ganondorf had \"successfully\" been killed at the Arbiter's Grounds, he felt a very heavy, very strange sense of guilt. Link was the one who barged into the castle to so passionately warn the Royal Family, so why was he now so upset that the dangerous man was gone? His people were thankful and tales of the Hero of Time began to spread across Hyrule, but Link was growing more and more distraught. He became distantly removed from those around him, and longed for his fairy Navi, who'd disappeared when he was sent back to his childhood. She went back with him, so was it possible she remembered the alternate events of the future the same way he did? Link soon decided to leave Hyrule and search the vast uncharted Lost Woods for her. Before leaving on Epona, Zelda entrusted the Ocarina of Time to him and told him never to forget the Song of Time, which he could play to call on the Goddess of Time (who is probably Nayru). Although he was sad to part with Zelda, Link's departure from Hyrule was a very personal embarkation. Not only was he searching for Navi, but he was searching for a place he felt he belonged in, for some purpose in life now that his job as the Hero was complete.Through the Looking Glass  In-depth info @ Wikipedia. Link rode into the Lost Woods on Epona to search for Navi, only to find nothing but trees and animals. He wandered for some time, contemplating quite a few things, and started to lose hope, but one day his search was cut short. A masked skull kid with two fairies emerged from the forest, stole the Ocarina of Time and tried to ride off on Epona. Link followed after him through the woods, but came to a cliff and fell a very, very long distance to the bottom - somehow landing safely on a strange flower. Skull Kid laughed at him and turned him into a Deku Scrub, an annoying, nut-spitting race of creatures whose bodies were made of leaves and wood.  Ocarina-less, horseless, transformed into this pest from his childhood and completely lost, Link was left by Skull Kid to deal with himself. One of Skull Kid's fairies, Tatl, got seperated from him, and after quickly apologizing, she told him to help her get out of where they were and back to her brother fairy, Tael. Link was in a strange dark cave after that long fall, and he wandered with Tatl until they found a door. It was the door to a huge clock tower, and as Link climbed the stairs and was about to exit it to see what was outside, and strange man appeared from nowhere and called out to him. The man introduced himself as the Happy Mask Salesman and explained that a little imp stole an extremely valuable and dangerous mask from him known as Majora's Mask. He told Link that Skull Kid was planning on destroying this world, called Termina, in three days, and that if Link could regain his Ocarina, the Salesman could return him to his Hylian self. After leaving the clock tower, Link found himself in bustling Clock Town. The townspeople were preparing for a carnival taking place in three days, but they were also in a small state of panic. A moon with a scowling face hung huge above Termina, and Link noticed it inching closer and closer as time went by. In three days it would crash into Clock Town. To Link's surprise, he recognized many of the inhabitants of Clock Town, although none of them knew him and they were leading vastly different lives - King Zora was the manager of a band; Anju was not tending chickens in Kakariko but working at an inn in Clock Town; Talon owned a bar and had no relation to the girls who owned the ranch and had a strong resemblance to Malon. Was this place truly connected to Hyrule via the woods, or was he in some strange different universe all together? On the third night in Clock Town, the door to the top of the Clock Tower opened, and Link climbed up to face Skull Kid at the top. After retrieving the Ocarina from him, Link played the Song of Time - a song taught to him by Princess Zelda - and out of desperation, sent himself back in time 3 days to avoid being killed by the moon. Back in the past, none of the people Link had met remembered him, and the moon was still there in the sky, a ticking bomb. But he remembered the Salesman's promise, and returned to him with the Ocarina. Link was turned back into a Hylian, and his Deku Scrub body was condensed into a mask, which he could put on to regain that form. He decided to set out into Termina and search for a way to stop the moon and Skull Kid. ...without having to write out even more backstory FFF, Link basically frees 4 guardians while obtaining 2 more transformation masks along the way, Goron and Zora. When he goes back to challenge Majora, Majora gives him a fourth transformation mask, the Fierce Deity Mask, which he had for whatever reason been carrying around with him. This mask turns Link into a very tall, very powerful being resembling a Hylian, with white clothes, white hair, white eyes and pale skin. His power is too massive for Majora, and he easily defeats him. Having relived those 3 days many, many, many times, Link finally departs for the Lost Woods again to continue his search for Navi. That is when he suddenly finds himself on a strange cruise ship known as the MS Elegante.The Masks Deku Mask  The Deku Mask was created when the Mask Salesman cleansed Link of the soul that Skull Kid cast on him after stealing the Ocarina of Time. The identity of this deceased Deku Scrub is the dead son of the butler to the Deku Royal Family. The nameless Deku seemed to have a good relationship with his father, who raced each other often. In the Majora's Mask manga it is revealed that the Deku Princess was in love with him before he disappeared. My personal fanon is that this Deku boy was a friend of Skull Kid's before he stole Majora's Mask, but in a malicious prank, Skull Kid turned him into a tree, killing him. Just to further the prank, he used his soul when turning Link into a Deku Scrub. Deku Link's abilities:Goron Mask  Link meets the ghost of Darmani the Third, a Goron hero, in the mountains after following him to his gravesight with the Lens of Truth. Darmani had ventured bravely off to Snowhead Temple to defeat the \"demon\" there, which was the cause of a sudden blizzard that was freezing Goron Village, but the blizzard's winds knocked him into the deep valley surrounding the temple, killing him. Having failed, he could not rest in peace. All he could do was watch Goron Village get buried in snow. Darmani asked Link to use his magic to bring him back to life - but if that was impossible, to at least heal his sorrows. Link played the ocarina for him, and his soul became the Goron Mask. Darmani himself is a very proud, very confident older Goron, experienced in battle and famous in the village as a great racer and wrestler, too. He was knocked off his pedestal when he was killed, of course, but he still remains very steadfast in his role as the protector of the Gorons even after death. Needless to say he and Link get along very well. Goron Link's abilities:Zora Mask  Link finds a dying Zora floating in the ocean when he goes to the Great Bay. After helping him get to shore, the Zora introduces himself as Mikau, the guitarist of the Zora band the Indigo-Gos, who were scheduled to perform at the Carnival of Time. He tells Link that a few days earlier, the band's vocalist (and probably his girlfriend) Lulu suddenly lost her voice and laid seven strange eggs. Soon after, Gerudos (who are pirates instead of thieves in Termina) arrived and stole her eggs. Mikau went to their fortress in an effort to save them - Zora eggs die unless they are kept together, and in very clean water - but the Gerudos found him, nearly beat him to death and dumped him into the water outside the fortress. Before he dies, Link plays his ocarina for him, and he becomes the Zora Mask. Mikau is more gentle than Darmani - he's a sensitive, poetic musician with a love for his art. Much like Darmani, it's mentioned that Mikau is the descendant of a Zora hero, which is why he is sent to the Pirates' Fortress to retrieve Lulu's eggs. Despite this, he much preferred a quiet life with his friends - just sitting in Zora Hall with Lulu playing his guitar and writing music. Zora Link's abilities:Fierce Deity's Mask  Majora gives Link a mask right before they face off. It looks like the face of an adult Hylian man, with red and blue face paint and a stiff expression. When Link puts it on, he transforms into a 7+ foot tall, extremely powerful being resembling a Hylian and wielding a twisted sword. As this being - the \"Fierce Deity\" or \"Demon God\" - he easily crushes Majora and succeeds in saving Termina and finally breaking free of his 3 day time trap. Why Majora would have such a mask on him, and why he would give it to Link and basically seal his own demise, is a mystery. Maybe he's just crazy - it's possible he saw the whole thing as a game and nothing more than that. There are many theories about the Fierce Deity, but that's all they are, theories, because there's essentially no canon information about him ._.  My fanon, the short version: the Fierce Deity is an ancient \"god\" of revenge. Maybe not a god in the literal sense, like the three Goddesses, but maybe a demigod/avatar with immense power who was worshipped as a god at any rate.When Majora began to cause havoc in Termina he went to defeat him on the Goddesses' behalf, but he got his ass whooped instead and Majora turned him into a mask just to make his fate that much worse. For thousands of years he's had Majora as his only company - I'm sure you can imagine that period of time wasn't full of gentle chit-chats over tea and biscuits. At some point Majora is killed and becomes a mask himself, but he still carries the soul-crafted masks he held when he was alive . When Link wears his other masks, he's borrowing that spirit's former form. But with the Fierce Deity's Mask, the soul inside is so powerful and has such an influence over him, that it's the mask's spirit borrowing his body. The Deity (as he's used to being called) isn't as willing to give up control when Link wants to return to his own body. The Deity's power was reduced greatly when he was killed, and by inhabiting Link's body he can use the Triforce of Courage to nearly be restored to his former strength, much to his delight - which doesn't help Link's chances of him willingly removing the mask. His morals are vastly different from Link's and he has a no-bullshit, bloodthirsty sense of justice. Having been a being of worship during his lifetime, he expects respect from others and attempts to take it when he doesn't get it. At the same time, his pride has been permanently scarred by his defeat at the hands of the villain he was supposed to kill, and any question relating to his death is flat-out ignored. Needless to say, Link really doesn't enjoy wearing this mask and tries to avoid it at all costs. It's the absolute last resort. The Deity's abilities:On the Elegante: Timeline July 2009  18: Arrives on the boat. Is reunited with Zelda.[1] Also remeets Jak, Kevas, Erol, Akagi, and Greed. 19: Introduces himself properly to the boat.[2] Meets Kate, Herz and Lily.[3] 20: Discusses the boat's time mechanics with Zelda.[4] Meets Thom and they play cupcake fetch.[5] Around 20~22: Link meets Motoko and learns[6] that Erol assaulted Herz. He visits Herz in the infirmary.[7] 22: Discusses Herz's assault with the boat.[8] Zelda assures Link that Erol is not pulling one over her head with his charm. Meets Hajime, Praxis and Kage. 23: Jak nearly tears Erol to pieces, but Link shows up wearing the Goron mask to break it up.[9] This is the first time Link wears one of his masks on the Elegante. He carries Erol to the infirmary, and after learning that Erol now refuses to attack anyone, even in self-defense, he decides to stay in the infirmary with him to protect him until he recovers. 24: Meets Amaria and Sora. 26: Goron Link and Erol talk while they're both stuck in the infirmary. Link talks to Praxis about Jak, and to Jak about what happened. Herz, Jared and Sora bring rocks for Goron Link to eat.[10] 27: Erol awakes to find Link had slept while he was out, anger and discussion of ethics ensue. [11]August 2009  1: The vigil over Erol is over. [12] Exhausted, he seeks out Zelda's safety, and he finally reveals to her what happened after she sent him back in time. They fall asleep comforting each other. Later he meets[13] and eats a meal with Midna and asks Praxis to allow Erol the right to self-defense. 3: Meets Gideon. 6: Link has recovered. Asks the crew for some ocean water to wash his tunic in. [14] Jams with Kate in the library. [15] 8: Relaxes as a Zora on deck 15 and is visited by a certain curious Twili. [16] 11: Shilo and Zelda's dramatic disappearances. Thanks to the strange negative emotional effects that start, too, Link doesn't exactly take it very well, and at a loss of what to do... 12: ...he ends up sitting in his room, sobbing. But when he finally meets his newly arrived look-alike (TP Link), it seems to help and they decide to work together. [17] 13: Link eavesdrops on Kevas and Shayn in the buffet, and also meets Asad. [18] They take him and Kevas to their hideout inside Carnival to prove they don't have Zelda. 14: Zelda returns. Link is relieved beyond description. [19] He vows to do this best to never let such a terrible thing happen again. 15~25: Shayn & Asad event. Still guilty about letting Zelda die, he instead helps Sheik \"guard\" her and assists passengers who need a safe place to go. When it's time to go take care of him, he follows the group along with Sheik and helps scout/kill bears in the background. 29: Link succumbs to the effects of a long-term hex that was cast on him during the fight, however, and collapses in the hallway on his way to see Zelda. Kevas finds him and takes him to the infirmary, where AMU begins to fix his rotting internal organs. She (...it?) puts him under general anesthesia to stop the intense pain, but...... he doesn't wake up from it, and slips into a coma.Relationships  Akagi - weird kid. Hangs out with Erol, so Link has a bad first impression. Doesn't act like a kid their age, but then again neither does Link. Amaria - a nice person, Link likes her although he still doesn't know her very well. AMU - Creepy infirmary robot. But it does its job amazingly, Link's assumption being that it uses magic. Erol - Link's biggest concern on the boat besides crew; even all his other deeds aside he seems to be targeting Zelda, which is enough of a red flag as it is. If it weren't for the system Link would have killed him by now (or at least tried to) and rid the boat of him. Unfortunately, that isn't possible, and in almost a reversal of that sentiment, he actually protected him once while he was injured and vulnerable to revenge from others. He spoke with him about ethics during that time and understands a little bit more why he acts the way he does. Greed - has offered to train him, this still needs to happen at some point. Hajime - another nice person, very smart and a little dry. Doesn't know him very well. Herz - Link's first friend on the boat, he hasn't had a chance to spend much time with him with everything going on recently, but adores him nonetheless. In Link's eyes, he's just the kind of person he's so dedicated to protecting and befriending. Kage - is crew so Link automatically is wary of him, but he didn't have a problem with Herz being attacked, so he likes him even less. And if that stuff with Zelda ever comes out, it'll go beyond simple dislike. Kate - a fellow musician and magician, Link think she's really pretty and nice too, so quick friends there. Jak - the situation with Jak is a little precarious. While Link likes him and has come to understand that he isn't a bad person, he's quietly jealous of his apparent relationship with Zelda. Jak even seems far better equipped to protect her than Link himself is. These two things bring to the surface several of Link's issues, and naturally because of that it's hard for Link to really think of him as a friend per se. They need to sit down and talk and come to an understanding, but it hasn't happened yet. Jared - says he knows Link from the last time he was apparently here, and still has a Hylian Sheild that he says Link gave him. Although he doesn't know him very well, he's more inclined to trust him if they had that sort of relationship before. Lily - a friend who Link can play with and be a kid with. Doesn't know her too well though. Midna - OMG BOOBS. Uh, I mean, someone from future Hyrule who knows the legends of the Hero of Time. Behaves weird sometimes but Link likes her if only for the fact that she walks around topless. Motoko - knows her shit and doesn't mess around, Link sees her as a capable person and gives respect. Praxis - Erol's boss and the person who reeled him in, Link has a certain respect and appreciation for him doing that, but is starting to catch onto his deceptive half-truths. Sora - a friend that Link can talk with and play with, someone who claims to be a \"hero\" too. Still, Link maybe has a hard time relating to him, he still seems very naive despite that claim. Sheik - Link's old comrade from the days of Ganondorf's rule and his life as an adult, Link had assumed he'd never see Sheik again. Sheik is probably the one person Link feels the most trust, most respect and most understanding with on the whole boat. They've both been through much of the same things and both share an unwavering dedication to the Princess. Shilo - Herz's girlfriend, Link likes her and would protect her just for that reason. Thom - PUPPYYYY. Link just loves playing with Thom, end of story. Every little boy wants a dog.\u00a0:'3 TP Link - his....... great-grandson? reincarnation? from the future. He refers to Link as \"Hero\" or \"sir\", which just feels weird and makes him sheepish and uncomfortable. But the resemblance between the two is startling, and Link can tell what a good person he is already. Shaping up to be a close ally. TP Zelda - not his Zelda, but she's just as beautiful and elegant (although seems a little more serious and level-headed). Link would protect her as he would his own princess. Zelda - the one person most important in Link's life, Link loves Zelda dearly both as a childhood friend and romantically, although he's well aware of the fact that they could never be together. Nevertheless, his devotion to her is unquestionable and he would literally do anything for her safety. Zelda is the one other person Link trusts without doubt besides Sheik, and they share both the common guilt of allowing Ganondorf access to the Triforce, and the reality of a Triforce piece being embedded in their bodies.Characters  Passengers and crew aboard the Failboat!Crack  Macros and Chatlogs and Memes, oh my!Gregory House Background  Gregory was born June 11, 1959. His parents were John and Blythe House. House was a military brat and lived on the various bases wherever his Marine Corps father was located. During his stay in Japan when he was 14, House decided he wanted to be a doctor after witness the respect given to a Buraku doctor. House admits that his father was abusive, and for this reason, he didn't believe the man to be his biological father. When he was 12, he began to believe a family friend with a birth mark similar to his own to be his father.  As a undergraduate, House attended Johns Hopkins University. He had excellent grades, but was later caught cheating by a fellow classmate, Philip Weber. He was denied re-entry into the school and so he finished his final year of medical school at the University of Michigan. It was here he met Lisa Cuddy. In New Orleans, he meets James Wilson. House is able to tell Wilson was going through a divorce and bailed him out after the distraught doctor started a bar fight. This was the start of their friendship. About 10 years before the series begins, House was involved with a woman named Stacey Warner. Five years after his relationship with Stacey began, House suffers an infarction in his right leg. He was misdiagnosed as the doctors treating him thought he was just a drug seeker. House ended up diagnosing the infarction himself and demanded to keep the use of his leg. The dead muscle would be bypassed in order to restore circulation, despite having to endure excruciating post-operative pain and the fact that it would release poisons into his system. He was put into a chemically induced coma to sleep through the worst of the pain. During this time, however, Stacey, his medical proxy, acted against his wishes and had the dead muscle removed. It was safer than what House originally intended to do, but it meant he would lose partial use of his leg and be subject to lesser but still serious amount of pain for the rest of his life. When House woke up and realized what she had done, he was unable to forgive her. She eventually left him because of this. He uses a cane to aid his walking and takes vicodin to relieve the chronic pain in his thigh.  During the first season, House and his team, comprised of Doctors Chase, Cameron, and Foreman, solved many medical anomalies. During this time, Wilson and Cuddy remark that there is a change in House's behavior, which they attribute to an addiction to vicodin. House vehemently denies being an addict and after Cuddy says she will give him a month off from clinical duty if he goes off the drug for one week, House agrees. It becomes clear with 72 hours that House is going through much more than just pain. He was detoxing. House manages to go a week without his drug, winning his month of freedom from clinical duty, but he breaks his hand to deal with the pain and nearly botches a case in the process. He finally admits to Wilson that he is an addict, but it's not a problem because he can function. (Season 1, Episode 11 \"Detox\") The diagnostics department is later turned upside down when Edward Vogler steps into their lives. Vogler was a billionaire who owned a pharmaceutical company. After donating $100 million dollars to Princeton-Plainsboro, Vogler becomes the new chairman of the board. He sought to turn Princeton-Plainsboro into a testing ground for his company's new drugs and saw House as a financial and legal liability. So he sought to make House kowtow, so to speak by making rather capricious demands on the doctor. One such demand was for House to fire a member of his team. House seemed willing, though he told Wilson he wanted a way to keep them all. Cameron had told House a solution: Each of them could take a pay cut and put in a few extra hours and they could all stay for the same amount of money. However, Vogler would not relent. He stated that the situation had never been a negotiation and he wanted to make sure House could do exactly what Vogler said no matter how distasteful he found it. A week past and Cuddy asked if House had made a decision. As a result, Chase was up for firing (Season 1, Episode 16 \"Heavy\"). However, Chase had been feeding Vogler information in exchange for protection. Vogler refused to accept House's choice and told him to pick again. House refused. Vogler eventually offers House a deal: treat an African American presidential candidate and give a speech supporting Vogler's new drug at a conference (Season 1, Episode 17 \"Role Model\"). House relents and gives a lack luster speech in an attempt to pacify Vogler and keep his team members. Vogler is not satisfied and makes him do it again or risk losing Cameron or Foreman. So House gives the speech again, this time stating the truth about Vogler's new drug. It wasn't really new. Just reformulated to avoid losing a patent and becoming a generic drug. After the incident, Cameron shows up at House's apartment and quits her job, therefore making House's decision for him. Needless to say, Vogler was furious and later calls for the board to dismiss House (Season 1, Episode 18 \"Babies and Bathwater\"). Cuddy eventually pleads with the board to rethink House's value as opposed to Vogler's donation. As she stated in the show's pilot \"the son of a bitch is the best doctor we have.\" She realized that they would be losing a valuable member of the hospital as well as opening the way for Vogler to make increasingly frivolous demands on them. So the board voted to keep House and voted Vogler off the board. And so he was gone, along with his $100 million donation. House finds Cameron and told her he wanted her to come back. He tried to give her everything she asked for, but she said she would only return if House went out with her (Season 1, Episode 18 \"Kids\"). House agrees. The date is nothing short of a disaster. But Cameron returns and life went on. Stacey returns toward the end of season 1 (Season 1, Episode 21 \"Three Stories\"). By that time, she's married to a man named Mark. He reluctantly agrees to treat an ailing Mark with unclear motives. Wilson seems to believe House is trying to win her back, but House confides in Wilson that he's glad Mark wasn't responding to treatment. He just isn't sure if it was because he wanted Stacey back or if he wants her to suffer. He treats and cures her husband. After which, Cuddy tells House she is considering hiring Stacey. He claims he doesn't have a problem with it. The season ends with House trying to walk without his cane. One particularly uneventful morning, during the beginning of Season 2 (Between Season 2, Episode 1 \"Acceptance\" and Episode 2 \"Autopsy\"), House reports to work and nothing seems out of the ordinary. He steps into the elevator at the Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital. And when the doors slide open, he steps out into the Elegante.Canon Information  Abilities/Powers: As far as magical abilities go, House has none. He's an ordinary human being from an ordinary version of Earth. However, House has an amazing intuition. He's easily able to determine intimate details about a person simply by the way they are dressed or nervous tics or habits. He can fire off accurate diagnoses even if it appears he wasn't paying attention. He is a medical genius and is a diagnostician with specialization in infectious diseases and nephrology. He's also has a knack for alienating people with his generally grumpy and unfriendly behavior. Oh is popping vicodin a talent? Cause he does that a lot too. Strength: Doctoring. And alienating people. Weakness: Alienating people. Personality: House is a jackass. Plain and simple. He's witty, cunning, and likes picking people apart if only (it seems) to mock their weaknesses. He's been called a number of things ranging from misanthropic to grumpy. His crankiness is often attributed to the pain in his leg. But Cuddy and Stacey both describe House as being this way before his infarction. Wilson once said, while doctors usually have a Messiah Complex and have a need to save the world, House has a Rubik's Cube complex. He simply has to solve the puzzle. He expects to find a rare or unusual disease in the cases he takes on, otherwise he's likely to reject the case altogether, because they're just not interesting enough. He avoids meeting patients unless it's absolutely necessary and when he does meet them, he's usually very blunt, unfriendly, and just a complete and total asshole to them. He puts off clinical duty and he tries very hard to take away the humane part of practicing medicine, claiming he treats illness not patients. Because treating patients is part of the reason most doctors are miserable. His odd bedside manner aside, House is extremely good at what he does. He's intuitive, and easily able to determine intimate details about a person simply by the way they are dressed or nervous tics or habits. He can fire off accurate diagnoses even if it appears he wasn't paying attention. This is shown when he manages to diagnose an entire waiting room full of patients in under a minute. He's a pretty firm believer that everyone lies, even though he joked that he was lying when he said that. He mocks social etiquette and just about anyone who believes in any sort of higher power. He has a tendency to be sardonic toward authority figures, as shown when he shirks clinical duty assigned to him by Dean of Medicine, Dr. Cuddy or when he finds a loophole as opposed to firing a member of his diagnostic team as Volger (a person who donated a large sum of money to the hospital) wanted him to do. He refuses to wear a white coat to avoid being identified as a doctor by patients and often dresses in t-shirts, worn jeans, and sneakers. House tends to avoid mature relationships. He doesn't have a great social life and the only friend he really has is James Wilson. Their relationship is odd at best, as they are constantly criticizing and analyzing each other. But Wilson is often putting his neck out for House, even though House very rarely shows any appreciation for it. Despite this, the two maintain a close friendship, and it's very obvious House would rather have Wilson in his life than not, no matter what he says to the contrary. People tend to think that House is content being miserable. And I believe to some extent this is true, but there is also some part of House that wants to be happy, that wants to have normal relationships like everyone else. For whatever reason, he simply can't. He'll always be insensitive and frank and an asshole. He speaks rather openly about porn and employs the services of hookers. He's rather blase about the opposite sex in general, often volunteering Cuddy for lap dances or remarking how hot Cameron or Cuddy look in their clothes. Extra:Elegante  Deaths: N/A - But he's working on it. Warnings & Punishments: N/ARelationships  House's new Wilson. At least that's the way House sees him. Gives him an excuse not to admit he misses Wilson. Why should he when he's got a perfectly good one right here. Weird woodland creature lady. She's kind of hot. Would tap that. Does as she's told. The new Cameron. Maybe Cuddy? Still need a Foreman and Chase. Any volunteers?Other Stuff, Links  AppKairi  \"And who knows: starting a new journey may not be so hard, or maybe it has already begun. There are many worlds, and they share the same sky - one sky, one destiny.\" - Kairi, Kingdom Hearts IICanon & Head-Canon Information  History: Kairi was born on a world called Radiant Garden - home of Final Fantasy crossovers - a short while before it's rulers turned it into a crapsack world. At four, spoilers happened and Stellar forgot to white-over them until they weren't really spoilers any more; . At around five, Kairi was punted off Radiant Garden by the Big Bad, and she landed on Destiny Islands. She had amnesia and was adopted by the mayor. She soon became best friends with two boys, Sora and Riku. When she was fourteen, the three of them made plans to build a raft and escape their world, because sailing out into the open ocean on a few planks of wood with no clear destination is the BEST PLAN EVER. Yeah, they never actually made it. Their world was swallowed by darkness before they could set off. In the commotion and to avoid being swept away by darkness, Kairi entrusted her heart to Sora, leaving her body as an empty shell. She spent most of the game as a disembodied plot coupon. Luckily, this lifted her childhood amnesia. She shared some of her memories with Sora, appeared to him as some kind of weird vision a couple of times, and was vaguely aware of what was happening to him so that now some Disney villains give her deja vu. Sora and Riku both searched for Kairi, eventually finding her comatose body. Sora sacrificed himself to restore Kairi's heart. She woke up. She then called him back from darkness. When Sora, Riku and their allies closed off the doorway to darkness, Destiny Islands was restored and Kairi returned to it. She soon forgot almost everything about Sora and struggled to remember him for a year. When she did, she decided that waiting around for him and Riku was not good enough, and so when presented an opportunity, she left her world and somehow got diverted to the Elegante. Abilities: Kairi has the power of heart. Seriously. As one of seven princesses of heart, Kairi is unable to be corrupted by darkness. She can sense and, to an extent, hold back darkness. If she is particularly close to someone, she can even pull them back from darkness, and thus keep them from turning into an adorable black bug of pure evil. She is very conscious of her heart's bonds with others, demonstrating an almost clairvoyant awareness of those to whom she's closest. Most of her abilities manifest instinctively as-needed and she has very little intelligent understanding of them. Kairi is capable of both summoning and wielding a keyblade, and has been since she was four years old. A keyblade looks like neither a key nor a blade, but it locks things, it has sharp edges, and wielders use it to magically beat the tar out of adorable black bugs of evil. BUT Kairi is either unaware that she's been given this ability, or she just doesn't remember, because she doesn't currently know about any of it. Aboard the Elegante, her semi-clairvoyant awareness of both darkness and her friends are all but cut off because there are no heartless on the ship and nobody's aware of what's going on outside the boat, not even Disney Princesses. She also can't summon weapons aboard the Elegante. tl;dr: Kairi has the power of heart. Surprise: It's useless. Personality: Kairi follows her heart. She's sociable and confident. She can be caring and kind toward people she likes. Conversely, she can be hostile and quick to anger at those she doesn't. She likes adventure, but no longer has any delusions about how dangerous or difficult it really is. She likes the security of knowing that a journey has an end and that she'll be able to return home again. While she can accept her own helplessness, she tends to grow impatient with passivity and will either do something stupid or find a way to make herself useful. She can be determined to the point of obstinacy. She can, at times, be naive and optimistic. This isn't to say that she's oblivious. Kairi is aware that the world can be a dark place  that bad things happen for no reason and that there are some really nasty characters out there. When directly confronted with this sort of thing, she tends to become withdrawn. She can't stay that way for too long though and given time and an opportunity, she will choose action - making things better - over introspection - dwelling on what's bothering her. In that sense, her optimism and her naivete are both deliberate and the results of her own determination. She simply refuses to give up. Kairi is impulsive. She isn't so much courageous as she is bold. When confronted, her first impulse is usually to defend or run. But she will stand and fight without a thought if she needs to. She doesn't worry about the consequences of her actions because often, she doesn't stop to think about them. She can get distressed if later confronted with these consequences. She can be frightened, but again tends to prefer to confront her fears rather than dwelling on them. In a confrontation, she will usually respond to fear with anger. She's not particularly smart or strategically minded. She is a fiercely loyal friend, often acting recklessly in a friend's defense. She would never willingly put a friend in danger, but she'll carry the idiot ball or a plot coupon often enough to make up for it.Elegante  Deaths: Warnings & Punishments:Relationships Other Stuff, Links  App Character Survey of Doom Elegante SurveyVincent Valentine  Vincent Valentine is a romantically awkward desk worker assassin turned technologically inept broody angstmuffin demigod of anarchy. Some of the time, anyway. He's also a shark.Background  About thirty years ago, Vincent was a member of the Shin-Ra Electric Power Company's Administrative Research Division--the company's Black Ops unit, otherwise known as the Turks. At the age of twenty-seven he was assigned to supervise something called the JENOVA Project in a town called Nibelheim, and there he fell in love with one of the supporting scientists, Lucrecia Crescent. Though they were very attached to one another, an unpleasant secret in Lucrecia's past--related to the death of Vincent's father--caused her to withdraw from him and instead pursue a relationship with another scientist, Hojo. Soon after, Lucrecia was discovered to be pregnant, and the fetus was slated to be used as a subject in the project. Vincent seemed to operate under the impression that the child was his, although her relationship with both him and Hojo made the issue of fatherhood rather vague. Vincent objected to the use of humans as test subjects--particularly when those humans were the woman he loved and what might very well have been his own unborn child--but Lucrecia proceeded with the treatment in the interest of science, in spite of Vincent's protests, and became very sick as a result. Outraged, Vincent confronted Hojo in his laboratory, where a heated argument ensued that came to a treacherous conclusion when Vincent's rival in love shot him in the chest.  Hojo proceeded to use Vincent's half-dead body as the subject for several experiments, initially for the purpose of strengthening his body's endurance, but eventually phasing over to a metamorphosis project that granted Vincent several powers, including the ability to turn into a series of monsters. However, he remained in an almost vegetative state for the majority of the projects, lingering between life and death until Lucrecia herself stepped in and made an attempt to rehabilitate him with the use of mako--the planet's blood--infused with parts of a monster known as Chaos. Due to Hojo's meddling, Vincent was able to survive the treatment, and was restored to health. He was also transformed into a monster with no apparent way of changing back. Thankfully, Lucrecia was able to introduce something called the Protomateria to Vincent's body, allowing him to regain both his control and his previous form. After this, Hojo had him sealed up in a coffin underneath the mansion where the research team had been staying during the project, and Vincent slept for thirty years. (Not counting a fleeting encounter with his former partner, Veld Dragoon, who found him during a mission. Vincent assisted in the fight, and then sealed himself back away and went back to sleep.) Eventually he was discovered by Cloud Strife and his companions, and joined forces with them to take down Hojo, find out what had happened to Lucrecia, and discover the fate of her son, Sephiroth. Vincent then took on a major role in the saving of the world and the defeat of said son, eventually discovering that at least Hojo believed Sephiroth was his child rather than Vincent's. He killed Hojo, helped defeat Sephiroth, and with barely a goodbye went about his way. Since then he's helped to fight off one more Sephiroth-related crisis, but for the most part remains on his own, drifting from place to place and keeping very sparse contact with the people who call themselves his friends.Personality  Dark and brooding over events in his past that he considers to be sins, Vincent is a man of many secrets. He seems very cold, level and collected, but isn't uncaring in spite of his history. He seems to like children, to an extent, having no issue siding with one of them in an argument with Cloud, and even met an accusation that he didn't care about the wellbeing of the planet with confusion. He seems very unemotional, but is in fact an extremely intense individual; he despises Hojo for everything he did, and still loves Lucrecia more than anything else in the world in spite of the fact that she willingly gave up her son to experimentation, and played a part in the revocation of his humanity. Vincent isn't particularly conversational and doesn't really make friends. In fact, he has little care for the wellbeing of others unless the threat reaches a large scale (ie: Meteor) or it effects some of those few people he cares about and/or willingly allies himself with (ie: The events of Advent Children). His lack of care for others is due both in part to his current state of being and his past as a glorified assassin in a clean-cut business suit; in his original line of business friendship wasn't really a priority, and in his current condition it isn't particularly safe for those involved. This means that under all the neuroses and killing, Vincent is just a little bit awkward, uncomfortable in social situations, and really has little to no idea what to do with himself around people in general. It doesn't help that he's completely aware of how very inhuman he is now, which gives him more than his fair share of self-loathing issues. He angsts, has a flair for the dramatic, and has been known to wax poetic on rare occasions about all the horrible things he's done. He carries around a very nice set of emotional baggage, so people tend to forgive him for being so undeniably emotastic.Abilities  Prior to being experimented on by his rival in love, Vincent was a member of Shin-Ra's Black Ops unit, the Turks. He, with several others, was responsible for doing the company\u2019s dirty work on command, regardless of how dirty the work was, and expected to keep it quiet. As a result, Vincent is highly skilled in the areas of espionage, informational recon, as well as various forms of combat. His primary fighting skills lie in the use of firearms, but he\u2019s also definitely capable of hand-to-hand--his special abilities see to that--as well as the utilization of magic for combat. After being experimented on, these skills were joined with a whole slew of abilities that probably weren\u2019t meant to live in human skin. Due to everything that was done to him, Vincent is immortal--but not invulnerable. His cells don\u2019t degrade naturally and he doesn\u2019t have to eat or sleep but he can be damaged. He has a very high pain threshold, however, and accelerated healing abilities, so he shouldn't be expected to go down lightly. Added to that, Vincent has superhuman senses, strength and speed, as well as the ability to fly. As if that wasn\u2019t enough, all Vincent\u2019s special abilities stem from his ability to transform into a series of monsters, primarily when under extreme duress. He appears to be capable of doing so at will, but his rampant hatred and disgust toward this particular ability are more than enough to make sure the majority of his inner demons\u2019 appearances take place in battle, when he\u2019s been wounded, or when he\u2019s filled with rage to the point of irrationality. On the Elegante, Vincent has lost the ability to transform into all but one of these monsters, leaving him with only unwilling shifts into Chaos for terrifying superpowers. Chaos, for explanation, is a creature known as a WEAPON, something similar to a demigod, created by the spirit of the planet to help bring about the end of the world. It's the harbinger to Omega, which was designed to take in the Lifestream and transport it to a new world when the old planet died. Obviously to take the Lifestream it has to be more or less complete, so Chaos was designed to go about killing every living thing left on the planet to return their souls to the main channels under the earth, thereby giving Omega the ability to take the entire Lifestream to another world. However, due to the necessity of a relatively pure energy channel, Chaos was also given the ability to strengthen itself by taking in tainted souls, the energy of the wicked. This means Vincent can feel a person's soul, taste it if he gets close enough; as Chaos he can tell just how blackened it is, and probably has a rather powerful inclination to rip it out. Sounds like fun, right?Appearance  Vincent is tall, rather slender for a man of his size, and appears to be in his mid-twenties in spite of being almost sixty years old. He has long black hair that he doesn't care to tame, is white as a sheet--probably from being locked underground in a coffin for thirty years--and has bright red eyes that glow in the dark. His facial structure and general coloration hint at possible Wutain heritage, but as his childhood is never detailed this is unclear. Commonly found wearing a tattered red cloak that covers the lower half of his face and a heavy red headband--either based off of or made from a scarf his father wore prior to his death--to keep his hair obscuring the rest, Vincent isn't particularly keen on letting people get a good look at him. (This is more than a little stupid, because by common definition he's drop-dead gorgeous. The likelihood of him believing this is slim to none, however, so there would be little point in trying to explain it to him.) Vincent originally wore a sharp brass gauntlet on his left hand, but this was confiscated upon his arrival on the Elegante due to the ability to use it as a weapon--which Vincent never did. The metal has thus far been used to obscure the disproportion of his left arm, which is permanently transformed into a Chaos-like state; there's still a heavy black glove and long sleeves to keep the claws and eerily ashen blue-white skin concealed, but the shape and size of it make the deformation more than a little obvious. For the most part, he'll keep this arm hidden in his cloak.Relationships Canonmates  Reno: Hardly the proper personality for a Turk, but very good at what he does nevertheless. Vincent spends all their conversations flopping back and forth between liking him and wanting to punt him off the Plate. Although they've had their disputes--one of which led to Reno getting gored half to death by Chaos and left to flee for his life until he all but passed out from blood loss--Reno and Vincent have most certainly reached a level of equilibrium in their relationship that keeps them both comfortable enough around one another. Initially this was due to the fact that they're officially the only two Turks on record who have ever actually died and come back rather than just being declared dead while running away somewhere, but as of the Anniversary Events it's thanks to Redd's enjoyment in switching people's bodies.\n Vincent has never had a kindred spirit before, but since Reno is now completely, even intimately aware of what it's like to be in Vincent's physiological situation, there's nothing else Vincent could call him. He's...not sure how to deal with this, aside from feeling horrible for Reno having to go through that.  Veld Dragoon: Vincent's partner-in-everything from when he was in the Turks, as well as his closest friend before his world went to hell. Vincent cares very deeply for Veld, but because of this he was initially almost terrified of being around him for any extended period of time--he'd much rather Veld was unaware of him and safe somewhere than close enough to be put in constant danger. Veld refused to stand for this treatment, and after a series of unpleasant events, he and Vincent fell back into some old patterns, at least. He's been attacked by Chaos as well, but his ability to fight the WEAPON off rather than simply get gored half to death has gave Vincent a bit of confidence in keeping his company. He's no longer afraid that Veld would hold back if he really lost it, and has little reason left to worry. At the masquerade, the assistance of Vincent's temporary humanization and Redd's pear wine led to them falling back into other old patterns, including but certainly not limited to spending the night together for the first time since before Vincent's departure for Nibelheim. This made things awkward for a while, but thankfully they've evened out since then. It should probably also be mentioned that in spite of the fact that Veld was the one to have dispatched Vincent to Nibelheim to begin with, Vincent has never even thought about blaming him for his current condition. But then, he has been known for absolving guilt from the people that he cares about most in favor of taking it on himself.  Lucrecia Crescent: RUINS ALL THE THINGS. Vincent adores her and would do almost anything for her, but isn't so much in love with her as he is completely, utterly obsessed. Having her here in the flesh is more than a little disconcerting, and considering she really can't even recognize him anymore, it's rather painful as well. To Vincent, Lucrecia is the culmination of everything he could have done better, testament to all his mistakes, a flawless beacon of eternal punishment that he will never be allowed to get close to again. Since coming to the Elegante Vincent has discovered that it was Lucrecia's experimentation on his body that infused him with Chaos, and as a result his entire opinion of her has come crashing down around his ears; maybe she wasn't an innocent after all. But if she wasn't innocent, then does he still deserve to be punished...?\n So far Vincent still isn't sure, but he has come to the decision since Lucrecia's experiments on Marco that she is not to be trusted, and needs to be kept under surveillance. He still loves her, make no mistake, he's simply reached a point wherein he's realized how dangerous she really is.  Sephiroth: By Vincent's estimation, this is the man responsible for almost destroying the entire planet for the sake of reaching godhood, razing tiny villages to the ground, killing presidents and guards alike, summoning drifting planets, waking WEAPONs, cutting buildings in half--all started by a psychotic break at discovering that his entire life had been a lie. Or...he will be, if he ever gets home. Fortunately--or unfortunately--this particularly incarnation of Sephiroth comes from a point prior to the aforementioned psychotic break, and as such is still a confident, arrogant, somewhat awkward and sarcastic war hero, and ShinRa's top SOLDIER. Vincent is stunned at Sephiroth's behavior, from his intelligence to his sense of humor, and is having a rather difficult time reconciling the two versions of this man into a cohesive picture. Even worse, Vincent has found himself liking the General, being impressed by his perception and clear-spoken nature. He sees a lot of Lucrecia in him, which hurts, but more than that he's starting to see flashes of himself. And, even with the lack of clarity on the issue of Sephiroth's parentage, that's sincerely disconcerting for the ex-Turk. Fairly recent events have led to Vincent offering full disclosure to Sephiroth, which has in turn led to Sephiroth making the decision that Vincent can be his father. Because Hojo sucks. Vincent...still doesn't really know how he feels about this.Acquaintances  Mimmi Kopanski: First person to talk to Vincent on the boat. Fairly normal, but deals with the boat's madness with impressive ease. Good dancer, too. [Positive.] Kimiko Ross: Generally Vincent's opinions of people are in terms of \"positive\" or \"negative.\" Kimiko, however, he likes. A lot. A lifetime and a half ago, he might have been interested in pursuing a relationship with her. As it stands, he has a bizarre sort of kindred-spirit fascination and affection. [Positive.] Auron: Something like a kindred spirit. Maybe. Vincent feels an affinity with Auron that he can't really describe--and the nice thing is, with Auron he doesn't have to. They play off each other well with very little speech involved, and Vincent is actually sincerely comfortable with him. He'd be very upset if Auron disappeared. [Positive.] Kobato Hanato: Vincent kind of Ultima'd her at the Halloween party, but he fixed it so that makes it okay. And she thanked him for fixing it, which was a surprise. Vincent is protective of Kobato in spite of just meeting her, and has a respect for her similar to that he has for Mimmi. [Positive.] Lily: Seems fairly normal, likes to talk. Reminds him very vaguely of Marlene before Meteorfall. Vincent wishes he could make her feel better about losing her family, but knows there's no fixing that. [Neutral.] Lenny: He's a bird. [No opinion.] Erol: Interesting taste in boots, dangerous personality. [Neutral.] Toboe: Young. Defeatist. [Neutral.] Ezekiel Lerish: Normal. [No opinion.] Leonardo: Intelligent, but has a lot to learn. [Moderate positive.] Anna Two: Interesting accent, difficult past. [No opinion.] Marco Devera: Intelligent, introverted, detail-oriented and proactive. Seems to have some kind of intelligence training. Vincent considers him an earth-native Turk, and trusts him as absolutely as anyone else from the department. [Positive.] Renna Moss: Kissed him. Very naive, apparently lacks a self-preservation instinct. Probably not entirely human. [Moderate negative.] Remy Whitecastle: Has inherent magical abilities. Well-informed and intelligent. [Positive.] Ironhide: Needs to learn basic logic. [Neutral.] Daxter: Did not do the research. [Neutral.] Jinx: A little whiny and a lot dense, but harmless. By initial estimation. His continued determination to hurt and even kill the people around him has left a rather bad taste in Vincent's mouth, especially as Jinx always seems to do it unintentionally. Idiots with luck are the worse kind.

He's not the smartest guy in the world, and he's got some \"sensitivity issues\". He was able to play for a professional hockey team for less than a year before he was injured badly enough to be put out of the game permanently. The injury was probably a knee injury that never quite healed right, or at least not well enough for him to play at the professional level again. It can be assumed that not so long after that, probably around the time the crime wave in New York started-- and about that same time, Casey probably picked up his whole vigilante shtick, which is how he meets the Turtles. Abilities/Powers: Casey is a boring, normal human. He has no superpowers, he has no crazy mutant abilities. What he does have is a golf bag full of gold equipment that he is going to smack you around with. A lot. He knows a lot about a bunch of different sports, but it stands to reason that he's really good at Hockey, having played professionally. He's pretty strong, too-- he's seen in the film not only knocking a guy out with a nine iron, but sending him flying backwards into a stack of boxes. Movie physics, probably, but Casey is kind of really strong. Strength: Casey can be a good friend when he thinks about it. He's pretty good friends with the Turtles, though he really only met them a few days before coming to the boat. As mentioned before, he's physically strong, and has a strong sense of justice. Weakness: April. Sensitivity. The lack of ability to know when it is a bad bad bad idea to use the nicknames \"Toots\" or \"Princess\" around women. Personality: Casey is a liiiittle insensitive and noooot the smartest guy in the world. He's gonna tell you what's right and what's wrong and he's going to reinforce the lesson with a blow from a bat.Elegante  Deaths: None, yet! Warnings & Punishments: None of these, either, but they can't be far off...Relationships  April O'Neil- The not-girlfriend. Apparently. Casey never had the benefit of getting around to the making-out thing. Michelangelo- The kid. He's fun, though. Donatello- The smart one. Raphael- F IS FOR FRIENDS WHO DO STUFF TOGETHER Leonardo- The leader-guy. Splinter- Casey has not met Splinter as of yet. He missed out on that opportunity in canon.Other Stuff, Links  AppMimmi Kopanski  \"I like to think that after all my time here I have simply gotten used to the insanity of the ship. But then I wonder, maybe I have not gotten used to it at all. Perhaps I have gone completely mad myself.\" Mimmi is the not!mommy of the good ship Elegante. She will mother anyone who comes her way. Especially if they happen to be a dysfunctional, ill-adjusted misfit. The New, Improved, Character Survey of DoomHistory  Mimmi was born October 20, 1925 in Berlin, Germany. Her mother is Maria Mader and her father is Anthony Kopanski. She is the eldest of four, having two younger brothers and a sister; Paul, Randolph, and Gertie. Her life was pretty average until Hitler and the Nazi party came to power in 1933. What began as just mild concern soon turned into outright, gut wrenching panic. Her father tried to convince her mother to go to America with him, but to no avail. As soon as the war started, her family began plotting to either flee the country whether Maria wanted to or not, or go into hiding. By March 1940, and with the help of a few family friends, Mimmi\u2019s family found themselves living in a small, cold, underground compartment located beneath a group of abandoned apartments. There was minimal contact with the outside world besides her family friends coming in with food deliveries, newspapers, and eventually, a small radio. Anxiously her family spent their days waiting around in the candle-lit darkness, ever paranoid that they\u2019d be discovered. It wasn\u2019t long before all that anxiety and stress began to take a toll on the family\u2019s relationships. They began to simply isolate themselves from one another and Mimmi took to her own musings, but even in that constant state of hopeless worry, she still had hopes for the future. They've been living underground for almost five years.Appearance  Mimmi is a bit scrawny and pale skinned. She's around 5'4\" and weighs roughly 110lbs. She has brown, wavy hair which is oftenpulled back into a bun. Her eyes are hazel. Her face is covered in freckles and she has a small mole on the side of her neck. Her left ear is slightly pointed.Timeline  For the the timeline, see here.Relationships  Super Simple Relationship List! Updated: 9/9/10 AMU: A super creepy robot doctor thing that she avoids at all costs. 'Nuff said. Bass (aka Forte): Honestly, Mimmi doesn't really understand why she mothers him so much. Or puts up with his crap in general. But the fact of the matter is that she does and she cares for his well-being. Bass reminds her of a bratty child, and in a way that reminds her of her brother, Randolph. (Though he's a brat in a much different way). From what she's gathered from his actions and speech, she's determined he was \"raised\" (if you can raise a robot) in an unkind environment, resulting in his more skewed personality. She believes he isn't all that horrible (even if he acts it) and that if he lets himself, he can actually be decent. He just needs a... more aggressive nudge in the right direction. She's not ready to give up on him just yet. Gavin Voelker: He's a poor guy that Mimmi has run into on occasion. He's not an overly social person and a pretty big hermit as she's come to find out. She's trying to convince him to get out more and take better care of himself. God knows if he's actually taking her advice. Gertie Kopanski: Mimmi's little sister! She gets all the love in the world more than anyone, seriously. Mimmi is terrified that her sister might disappear one of these days, and after she was killed, Mimmi watches her much more carefully. Sometimes. Gertie likes to disappear where to where Mimmi can't find her, which scares the fuck out of her. \u2665\u2665\u2665  Gideon: Mimmi has come to love Gideon dearly in a mainly platonic way. He's like the older brother she never had. They've got each other's backs. He's also great company. But she's slightly put off by the fact that apparently people mistake them for being together on occasion. Which isn't cool. Considering he already has a girlfriend and she looks at him as an older brother. She doesn't like him any other way. No really. Gunnar Dottir: Though uncertain about him at first, Gunn is on friendship terms with her now. Mainly because of Gertie. He might start working around the Coffee Shop now, so that's a plus. Herz Hessian: Neutral acquaintance. Jak: HATE. He killed Oleg, therefore Mimmi hates him forever. Period. No exceptions. (Okay, she feels kind of bad that it was basically her fault that Bass killed him. Just a little, though). Kate Starlen: Gideon's girlfriend. They don't talk much at all, so Mimmi doesn't know what to think of her much. She's nice at least. And any friend of Gideon's is a friend of hers. Lenny: Oh Lenny. Lenny is an adorable yet strange, confused little thing that is apparently completely infatuated with her. Unfortunately, Mimmi is completely oblivious to this. They've met in person a few times and she enjoys his company even if he is a little... odd. This was all when he's human, however. Mimmi has no frikkin' idea that he's a motherfucking bird. None. And she's even met his bird-self before, too. Talk about a head-screw, man. Lily: An adorable girl who seems to have made quite a place for herself on the ship. Mimmi thinks she's sweet, if considerably undereducated. But that doesn't matter, really. A considered little sister replacement up until Gertie came around. Now she's sort of like that-little-girl-next-door-you-babysit-sometimes. One of her \"children\" in her not!mommy club. Phoenix: Though Mimmi likes him for the most part, he injured Lily, which isn't cool. And though it wasn't his fault, she still can't let it go. Azula: HATE. She's a horrible, evil, witch. She can gtfo. Remy Whitecastle: He's like that one cool uncle that you get in every family. He helped her out when she first arrived on the ship and explained everything to her. He's always very nice to her and fun to talk to. He and Hajime made quite an amusing team way back when. Salvador Rallo: This guy is SUPER FUCKING TALL. He has to be at least over a foot taller than her, but he's certainly not that much older than her. It's amazing! He's a nice fellow. A friend of Gertie's. Sokka: Though she's still not overly familiar with him, she likes him and is concerned for his well-being. Toph Bei Fong: They met under unfortunate circumstances. Besides that, Toph seems very capable of taking care of herself despite her blindness and has a strong personality. She doesn't exactly need a lot of mothering. Damas: Intimidating and kind of awkward to be around. But he's nice enough. (She also isn't aware he's Jak's father). First Mate Kage: Also kind of intimidating. And blunt. Also crew. Alice Kingsleigh: What is wrong with you, lady? Katara: See Sokka. Zuko: Uncertain about him at first, because he's Azula's brother, but he's proven to be civil, sane, and helpful. The Riddler: This guy can gtfo. You don't touch her locket. Ever. Goten Son: An adorable child. Dr. Lucrecia Crescent: Positive acquaintance. Motoko Kusanagi: Neutral acquaintance. Vincent Valentine: Mimmi finds there's a lot of work that needs to be done on this guy. He seems unable to come to terms with himself, and it's a bit saddening. She wants him to be happier, dammit. John Hancock: He tried to save her life, once. Vanyel Ashkevron: She helped save his life once. Tony Shepherd: This guy. She hates this guy. Don't even play. She has never cussed so much in her life. Jinx: SHE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO THINK ANYMORE WHAT. Kairi: A sweet girl. Protoman (aka Blues): A sibling of Bass, therefor he's on good graces with her. He's quite anti-social, however. Roll: A nice robot girl who apparently also knows Bass. Erik: Mimmi didn't like the Phantom and doesn't like him any more now that he's on the ship again. The Rowan: Neutral acquaintance. Pyro: He killed her. She's terrified of him. Their bad start is used for many life-ruining goodness. Anna Two: Positive acquaintance. She can speak German, so she gets bonus points. Brynhildr Dottir: Positive acquaintance. Chelle Vierren: Positive acquaintance. Isabella dela Vega: Despite the fact that she's a vampire, Mimmi thinks she can overlook it. (Gertie was killed by a vampire. >: ). Isabella is civil. Kevas: Troll. Neutral acquaintance. Marco Devera: Neutral acquaintance. Sulphur: Neutral acquaintance. Torin Navekha: Positive acquaintance. Xanth Aumeli: Positive acquaintance. Yugi Mutou: Oh hello newest not!child. How are you. Link: POOR THING.\u00a0;A;Miscellaneous  Hi I'll put more later when I'm not lazyZelda/Sheik Background Information Childhood Dreams  Zelda's mother passed away when she was young, and the princess grew up with a father that was overwhelmingly skeptical and likely was not too involved with Zelda's routine schedule. She seems to have little to say on the matter, with the exception that he did not believe she was a prophet and had little faith in her visions and her foreseeing of the future. She does not hold it against him, however, and loves her father in spite of any such indication made on his part. There's a chance that on the other hand, Zelda's mother also had abilities with regard to predicting future coming events. Before she passed away, she divulged the secrets of the Royal Family to Zelda, under the pretense that her daughter not say a word of it to any other. Although it's not specified whether her father was aware or not, Zelda upheld the promise to her mother until Link came to see her for the first time. When asked why she chose to tell him of the legend of her family, Zelda states it's because not even her own father believed her, implying that there's a possibility that Zelda didn't have many people who were willing to either listen to her seriously or who were even around period. Zelda, as a child was very different from how she grew up to be. With her father in control of the country and Zelda's mischievous nature, she appears to have often left the side of her caretaker, Impa, in favor of indulging in childhood activities. There's a possibility that she was longing for a type of freedom that she couldn't get from being born as a princess. When meeting Link in the castle town market for the first time, she thanks him for treating her as a normal girl, likely sparking her immediate fondness for him. Aside from him, Zelda is never seen with anyone else other than her nanny. As a result, it's plausible that Zelda's only other friends were her scholars. Upon Ganondorf Dragmire's invasion of Hyrule, Zelda was escorted away by Impa after the princess found out that her father had been killed. Once Link opened the Door of Time and withdrew the Master Sword to open the way to the Sacred Realm, Zelda attempted to locate the Triforce and 'reign' over the land. The Triforce, incapable of determining good from evil was not capable of keeping itself from Ganondorf's grasp and it was with the Triforce of Power that he was able to fully draw Hyrule into a land of loathing and hatred. It was under the Sheikah's care that Zelda made a most fated decision that would hopefully benefit Hyrule and her people.The Exiled Sheikah  Zelda felt tremendously powerless with Ganondorf in control and was completely unaware of the Triforce breaking into three individual pieces. Believing that all hope was lost for her future, she could not stand aside in hiding without experiencing a great amount of frustration. In consequence, she made a very special request of Impa--one that the Sheikah reluctantly decided to lend her consent to. In an attempt to make up for her prior discrepancies, Zelda requested that she be turned into a boy. Under Impa's direction, the princess's conscious mind was sealed off and she was turned into a young Sheikah boy, and raised (most likely in Kakariko Village) under the traditions of the Sheikah. While we are not given much information with regards to how Sheik grew up, we can safely assume that at his coming of age, his left ear was pierced by Impa as a rite of passage, just as she later chooses to do with Link once he's proven he's capable of wielding the Master Sword. With Sheik's leave of his 'hometown' (again, likely Kakariko Village as that was once filled with the Sheikahs), he went to Ganondorf and at his feet bowed and offered his loyalty in order to become one of his followers. He was under the orders to locate Princess Zelda, which implies to some degree that Sheik with his own separate conscious may have only been faintly aware of his dedication and protection of the princess. Out of Ganondorf's watchful eye as well as the two witches, Koume and Kotake, Sheik was responsible for pointing Link in the proper direction to overthrow the Evil King. When asked why he offered his allegiance to Ganondorf and why he no longer supported Hyrule's Royal Family, Sheik explained that he was simply a wandering minstrel, a mercenary in some terms, with nothing to do and therefore had no reason to turn down Ganondorf's leadership. Whether that's actually the situation or not, was not recovered. Sheik was thought to be an exiled member of the Sheikahs, or to some degree a pariah of his particular tribe, which would have resulted in his wandering as a drifter of sorts. The design upon his apparel is defined as the significance of a tale passed down from his ancestors. Originally it was simply an eye, however, at one point in time Hyrule's Royal Family betrayed the Sheikahs. He doesn't state when, but there's a possibility it took place around the time of the Great War where Link's father died in battle. A consequence of the betrayal led to the tear being added to their emblem, likely to serve as a reminder of the past. Sheik claimed it held no influence over him as it was an event in the past and not something of the present or the future. There is a point at which when traveling through the Desert Colossus, Link is overcome by illusions and hallucinations created by the whipping sands. Those with pain within their hearts are put against the moments, or the people who have struck them the hardest in terms of emotional attachment. Sheik, however, sees nothing and it is implied that Sheik has no pain within his heart, likely due to the idea that he does not hold Zelda's regrets as his own. In the Gerudos' fortress, Sheik poses as a traitor to Link and has him imprisoned. When he gains his freedom, Sheik turns on Koume, Kotake, and the others of the desert. Suffering from his wounds, Link brings him to a safe haven and it's in his recovery that Sheik reveals himself and his secret.A Glimpse to the Future  Zelda apologizes for the way she had to deceive Link, and also for the conflicts that she caused him. It's implied that the telling of Ganondorf coming to Hyrule was all preordained long ago. It later becomes referenced to as the Great Cataclysm and becomes seen as some sort of destiny that would need to be fulfilled by the Princess of Destiny and the Hero of Time, along with the ancient Sages who built the temples that served as the final stronghold for holding the Triforce in safety. Although Zelda is also one of the ancient Sages, her attribute is not noted, though it would seem to be logical that she was the Sage of Wisdom or something similar to that. With the Ocarina of Time in hand, she uses her abilities to send Link back in time, so he may relive his childhood, the one that she stripped him of because of her foolish behavior. It's a bit of a tearful farewell, but a clear reminder of how Zelda feels about the man who went to such lengths to protect her. Her love for him, however, is a bit of an unrealistic one. She holds Hyrule in too high of a standing to ever allow her heart to get in the way. At least, that is what the wise princess claims.Fanon  Questions and comments can either be directed to me through the private messaging service of LJ or through AIM (which will not be publicly posted here).The Pariah and the Princess  It is my belief based on dialogue in the manga that at the time of Ganondorf's invasion into Hyrule, Zelda was taken from his grasp. Wherever Impa took her (which we're not actually informed of, but likely might have been Kakariko Village), Zelda was unhappy. Unhappy because she felt useless and didn't want to leave her kingdom in ruins or in the hands of a mad man from the desert. In asking Impa for help, it's pretty obvious that Zelda couldn't have gone around as the princess, because Ganondorf was looking for her. (While it wasn't explicitly stated at the time, I think Zelda had an inkling that something with the Triforce pieces would come about.) I like to think that Impa, at the request of Zelda and even agreeing that it would be better for her safety, 'bestowed' Sheik onto her. It's not shown how this is done, but it implies that the Sheikahs have a great form of magical power, perhaps even more so than the Hylians. In the novel, Impa claims that she puts Zelda's conscious mind to sleep and raises her into a Sheikah boy. Being that I do play Sheik as being fully male and Zelda as fully female, I believe that Sheik was either an idea or an entity that Impa created and implanted into Zelda. I picture it as forming a seed, watering it, and watching it grow, and the seed represents Sheik, who likely began at the age of ten, like Zelda, and through the seven years that Link was dormant, grew into the adolescent he is when he's first seen. I portray Sheik as being a bit aloof, very cryptic, and either blatant or inconspicuous depending upon the situation and the others (if applicable) involved. He's slender, limber, not too entirely tall, and certainly does show himself as being a bit of a younger man. Well, would if he ever showed his face. It wouldn't be completely improbable for his bandaging to prevent someone from determining his age. He's normally calm and collected unless the extreme situation calls for it. The M.S. Elegante is a place of extremities, and as a result, he has a bit more difficulty retaining his composure. He's known for being crafty and generally subtle. This depends on circumstance and those he chooses to associate himself with. In consequence, it would be unfair to assume that he will approach all situations with the same mannerisms. Sheik can be seen as holding a bit of animosity toward his position as Zelda's guardian. Per the traditions, the Sheikahs have always been the protectors of Hyrule's Royal Family, and have also been considered 'shadows'. Sheik is literally a shadow of Zelda's due to the way they are fused together to one entity. As a result, there are two sides to Sheik and how he perceives his stance with regards to the princess. The first is his overwhelming need to protect her for his benefit. Should something happen to Zelda, he suffers the repercussions and the same the other way around. If she dies, he dies. If he dies, she dies. Some of it is honor, but much of it is deliberately implied to be a bit selfish. It can also be assumed that he wants to be his own person and at times, will forgo Zelda's requests to fulfill his own--as long as they don't endanger her. The other part is the idea that after seven years of seeing all of the torment she had to go through, it's not improbable that Sheik loves Zelda. To some degree. He likely won't ever admit it, and he'll probably cover it up by coming off as overprotective or self-centered, but it should be noted that he can suffer an extreme envy at the idea of anyone ever growing as close to Zelda as he is. The only exception to this is Link, and that is because Sheik's trust in Link stems from his respect and from their past together. Zelda is played as being a very kind and considerate woman, always wanting to do what she believes is right, and always wanting to be helpful to others. Although she's aware that she's incapable of playing the prince and always having a hand in the things that occur, she always attempts to do her very best. She's diplomatic and would rather use words, compromise, and negotiation to make things occur. She can, however, and will--if absolutely necessary--use force to accomplish the tasks set before her. She may come across as delicate and fragile, and perhaps even naive, but she has many strengths that she may or may not hide in order to maintain a low profile. She is more capable of influencing change if she is not seen as a suspect of opposing activity and is well aware of it. Her relationship with Sheik is one she doesn't speak of much. She personally doesn't know a lot about him. Sheik tends not to disclose information to her once it's occurred, perhaps for her safety, perhaps to keep her from chiding him. For whatever reason, he leaves her in a common state of confusion and holes in her timeline where she doesn't know what's happened over the course of a few days. If things happen that she needs to know about, Sheik will at least inform her of that, but it's based on what he feels she needs to know--something that can easily be debated. On the other side, Zelda is normally open with Sheik and will tell him who she's associated with, or allow him to watch her situations from a third-person perspective (in a manner of speaking). Sometimes he can grow too inquisitive for his own good, however, and she will close herself off. Aside from her trust in him, Zelda has no other particular fondness or fascination for him. She appreciates him, but if there are truly feelings of love present for her, she does not reciprocate them.The Triforce, Nayru, and Abilities  The Triforce emblem upon the back of the right hand for Sheik and Zelda is shown as glowing only a few times in the game and the manga. It seems to glow when Zelda transforms into Sheik (and vice versa), when any sort of magic is cast, and when the pieces of the Triforce attempt to resonate with one another. (We have yet to see if this will actually happen.) As Sheik and Zelda communicate with one another and at times in the midst when one is in engaged with outer conversation, it seems plausible that if the inactive form wants to present himself / herself the attempt to transform or the expression of the desire can cause a glow of the Triforce as well. It should be noted, however, that Zelda and Sheik will never transform in a public situation unless the predicament essentially calls for it. Otherwise, it can be assumed that they transform in the safety of their solitude. Any magic that Zelda is capable of casting Sheik can cast as well, but not nearly at such a greater level. Being that Sheik is supposedly a member of the Sheikahs, however, it could be contrived that the Sheikahs have higher ability than the Hylians do. It's difficult to say as Sheik has rarely cast anything and tends to only use Deku Nuts for any form of 'magic'. This will be a case-by-case basis that determines what Sheik is or is not capable of. Zelda's magical abilities include precognition, telepathy, a few elemental spells, and the power to create and break seals and barriers. She has an affiliation with the Goddess of Wisdom (Time, in some cases), Nayru, and also the Triforce of Wisdom, which affects her keen observation and judge of character. She can see many truths and is not easily fooled into trickery. Unfortunately, however, this does not always prevent her from falling into traps that could otherwise be easily avoided. Further theory on the Goddess Nayru and Zelda. Nayru was the goddess responsible for bestowing the world with wisdom and the idea of what is lawfully right and wrong. Although not explained fully, it is implied in various forms of media that there is a connection between Princess Zelda and Nayru. It is my choice to perceive it as the idea that Zelda can possibly be defined as the Goddess Nayru in human incarnate. Possibly, potentially. She will never call herself this, and even if she were to believe it (which she likely does not), she would only admit to the idea that she is a 'direct messenger' to Nayru. No matter what the case, it is not implausible that if Zelda is not truly Nayru entirely, that she either has been, will be, or can be used by Nayru to carry out her personal guidance. Due to the direct affiliation and connection between the two, Sheik tends to always refer to various situations as 'By the Goddess Nayru', as opposed to Zelda who prefers to use, \"By the goddesses [three].\" This could be considered Zelda's way of attempting to inconspicuously sever her ties with Nayru, although unlikely as Zelda holds a great loyalty and respect for her. Zelda has given a codename of Nayru once and that was in a trip through Carnival with Kevas and Greed, the latter of whom is no longer aboard. Zelda has very little fighting ability, but is implied that she is an accomplished archer through a variety of media. I have chosen to incorporate this into her character, likely due to the idea that it will not truly influence anything aboard the ship. There is a possibility, slight, but present all the same that Zelda's ability to call upon arrows of light may not require a bow. This is subject to discussion, depending upon circumstance.The Sheikah  In the beginning, the three goddesses created the world, the people who would live upon it, and the idea of what was considered \u201cright\u201d and \u201cwrong\u201d. They departed for the heavens and the spot where the three left created the sacred artifact, the Triforce, which would grant the wish of its holder. Those with pure hearts would bring the world into a golden age of prosperity. Those with evil hearts would plunge the world into everlasting darkness. It is stated that the goddesses created the Hylians in their own image. (Although once you get into later canon, it\u2019s thought that the Oocca were actually responsible for that. Neither Zelda nor Sheik, however, have this information.) Beneath the Hylians, the Sheikah came about. The Sheikah were said to have hailed from Kakariko Village and were charged with the responsibility of protecting Hyrule\u2019s Royal Family. In nature, they are dexterous, agile, and gifted with quick reflexes, often coming off as very ninja-like beings. They are generally marked with the Eye of the Sheikah, which is an emblem that depicts a red eye and a fallen tear, supposedly a consequence of a great betrayal Hyrule\u2019s Royal Family made against the race. Sheikah and Hylians look alike. They have similar ears, but differ generally in height (as it seems the Sheikah are taller) and have eerie red eyes in contrast to the blue that many Hylians hold. It\u2019s difficult to pinpoint exactly what the average Sheikah looks like as through the Imprisonment War, it\u2019s considered that the Sheikah are extinct. This is, however, contradicted by Sheik\u2019s presence after Ganondorf has come into power and turned Hyrule into a land of absolute hate and atrophy. Although there is a lack of Sheikah people throughout Link\u2019s journey, there are places and things decorated with the Sheikah emblem, implying various connections through different areas of Hyrule. In particular, the Sheikah seemed very dedicated to Hyrule\u2019s history. As Sheik leads Link to his next destinations during the Imprisonment War and even after his great success, Sheik shares stories and legends passed down through the texts and the Royal Family. This implies that the Sheikah have been around for a great period of time and likely know of every single thing that has occurred in Hyrule\u2019s history. There is also an indication in the novel where Sheik admittedly states that he was cast out of his particular tribe of Sheikah, which resulted in his seemingly mindless meandering that led him to work beneath Ganondorf. (When in actuality, Sheik was simply hiding behind enemy lines in an attempt to keep the Princess Zelda [and her piece of the Triforce] safe.) If such was not stated as a lie to keep Ganondorf satisfied, then it signifies that Sheik and Impa possibly came from the same tribe in comparison to others. In further analysis of the Sheikah, it\u2019s plausible that at one point in time, the Sheikah were one. In the back of Kakariko Village there is a cemetery that holds the bodies of Hyrule\u2019s Royal Family, to whom the Sheikah have sworn fealty. Some time before Link began his journey, there was a great evil that the Sheikah banished to the bottom of the well in the village. During the Imprisonment War, the evil escapes and seeps to the temple that lies beneath the cemetery. The temple, which is referred to as the Shadow Temple, is also defined as the House of the Dead, which literally may imply that it has a connection to the Royal Family\u2019s tomb as well. Given the environment of the Shadow Temple (blood splattered against walls and the floors), the various monuments (a ship that seems to ferry those condemned to death by use of the Royal Family\u2019s sacred song), items (guillotines and other such torture devices), and overall demeanor, it\u2019s possible that at one point in the time, the Sheikah were guilty of taking the felons against Hyrule and torturing them before sending them to execution, although it\u2019s not quite clear when in particular this might have occurred. As the Sheikah were said to be greater in number before the Hyrulean Civil War, it may have taken place then. It\u2019s also possible that following that particular war, the Sheikah were filled with such animosity that in order to gain revenge, they turned to the darker arts and the could have been constructed for such a thing. If such were the case, over time Hyrule\u2019s Royal Family might have discovered this horrendous secret and that resulted in the exile of the Sheikah, which may be what they define as the great betrayal that brought about the tear in their emblem. Whether or not that was accurate, if differing tribes of the Sheikah existed, then it\u2019s not impossible to think that in the midst of the torment and the torture of various criminals to Hyrule\u2019s law, that the Sheikah separated, one pro the actions of the Shadow Temple, and one against. That is simply a piece of what could be Sheikah history, which is not often delved into. Sheik himself (in the novel), states that what happened in the past had nothing to do with him and held no bearing on his existence. Therefore, it\u2019s safe to assume that while Sheik may know what occurred, he was not a part of either tribe. The same cannot be said about Impa, however, and even Sheik\u2019s information on her appears limited. The conclusion we can draw is that great mystery surrounds the Sheikah, their history, and their future\u2014assuming one exists. Various items such as the Lens of Truth and the Gossip Stones (also known as Stones of the Sheikah) can help in discovering more, but none of the answers are truly given. Anything Sheik says about his people or himself should be taken with a grain of salt and not as matter-of-fact, no matter how confident he may sound.The Seven Years Between  Zelda often comes across as a bit sheltered, in spite of her grand tutelage she received when she was younger. It is by choice and reasonable possibility that the reason for this is because of Sheik's appearance. In the novel, it's specifically stated that Zelda's conscious was sealed away, so she could be raised as a Sheikah boy for her own protection. The manifestation of Sheik (whatever he may be, for not even he knows what to define himself as) appeared and replaced Zelda's. In consequence, it's likely that her memories, her entire being was put on pause for the seven years (plus, as we're not given a time frame in which the Imprisonment War took place). If this is truly the situation, then it would not at all be surprising for Zelda to admit that she lost seven years of her life to Sheik. In those seven years, she personally didn't experience all of the heartache and the sorrow. Any inclination that she was given of it probably came from Sheik who relayed the events to her. Sheik, however, being as protective as he appears to have been, may not have been so forthcoming. It's more likely that he wished to soften the reality of it all, which resulted in missing holes in her knowledge. (This could easily tie into present Sheik, who seems to only tell Zelda what he feels she needs to know, rather than informing her of all things occurring in her absence and his presence.) To be a bit more precise, Zelda could easily be construed as a ten-year-old girl in the body of a seventeen-year-old young lady. This may better explain her sometimes frantic nature when it comes to properly ruling Hyrule or caring for her people as well as her behavior toward others and her inability to explain things in great detail that took place between the Great Cataclysm and the Imprisonment War. Although she presumably knows of Sheik's hidden motives or of his position in her absence, she chooses not to voice this, perhaps a means of protecting him from various people who would dislike Sheik anymore than they already do.Elegante The Arrival  Zelda had been in the midst of formulating a plan for Hyrule's reconstruction. Many of the towns were destroyed by Ganondorf's minions. Zora's Domain remained frozen over in spite of Link and Princess Ruto's efforts to thwart the evil in the Water Temple of the Zoras. Many innocent people, soldiers and civilians alike, were sacrificed for the Evil King's causes. Although he was sealed into the Sacred Realm, his tyranny was still a vibrant painting for Zelda and her people. It was in her attempts that she was stripped from her homeland and taken to the ship known as the MS Elegante, a vessel heading toward something known as the 'Golden Shore' under the capable hands of the Captain James Wolfgang Redd. She held only the Ocarina of Time on her person when she arrived. Still harboring Sheik within her, however, he shows himself only when he feels the princess will be in danger, and carries his harp with him. When she initially arrived, Link had been aboard, however, not too long after he vanished. Zelda has been hurt by his absence and resolves to sentence herself to eternal thoughts of Hyrule. She is somehow partially relieved and distraught at the same time that Link was not truly the Link from her time period. In consequence of that, Zelda failed to tell him how she felt about him, and refuses to acknowledge the feelings further. Of course, that is much easier said than done.The Present  [Under so much construction, you have no idea.]Trivia  \u2605 Zelda wears one Triforce earring in her right ear. Jak holds onto the other, significant of the promise they made to one another. \u2605 The pendant of orange that she wears is the Seal of Mar. It was a gift from Jak, a sign of his affection for her. It also serves as a key to various parts of Haven, not that such will ever come to help Zelda. \u2605 Like Sheik and his harp, Zelda always carries the Ocarina of Time on her. It's hard to pinpoint exactly where she hides it, however, or if she uses some form of magic to make it materialize. \u2605 Although she carries it constantly, Zelda rarely plays the Ocarina of Time. When she does, however, she's generally certain no one else can hear her. \u2605 She only wears it on special older brother occasions, but Zelda has a pimping white hat just like Kevas's. He made it for her. \u2605 Zelda has one golden frog, but she doesn't know what it's good for. She used to have two, but she gave one to Link {OoT} when he came back. One came from her shared victory with Reiner during the baby event. And another came with another series of awkward events that involved aging, gender, personality, and a loss of memories. She keeps hers safe in her room. \u2605 Like her granddaughter, Zelda doesn't like the elevators and will only take them when she's with someone else. \u2605 Failing to use logic when picking a direction to go, entirely by choice, Zelda tends to go to the right first, as her right hand is her dominant hand. \u2605 The following aboard the Elegante know that Zelda and Sheik share a form: Zelda {TP}, Erol, and Jak. The crew also seems to know. If not all of them do, then Kage does, at least. \u2605 Zelda's favorite place on the ship is deck thirteen and the field of never-ending flowers. She also likes the caves on deck fifteen, the forest on deck three, and the maze on deck fourteen. Aside from those, however, Zelda's usually in Jak's room. \u2605 Sheik's favorite place on the ship is deck fifteen and the caves. He doesn't have a real reason as to why, but he has a fondness for the stalactites. \u2605 If Zelda wakes in the middle of the night, Sheik will generally take over and wander the ship, before returning Zelda to bed before the night ends. Most of the time. \u2605 All the females of the Royal Family are named Zelda. She doesn't really know why this is; she just knows that's the way it is. \u2605 Zelda has a pet rabbit that likes to hide under things. He was a gift from Hazar. His name is literally \"XII\" (which is pronounced as \"Twelve\"). Hazar is the one who named him. \u2605 Although not available in canon, Zelda defines her date of birth as September 08. She hasn't told anyone this, however, and therefore it's passed without a commotion. People don't age on the boat, however, so Zelda's still only 17. \u2605 Sheik, not created at the time of Zelda's birth, likely doesn't share the same birthday. He was given one of November 04 by Bryn and Lily, however. His age is considered to be unknown. Literally, however, as he was only created when Zelda was 10, he might only be 7 years old based on her age. \u2605 The bones in Sheik's left hand are artificial. For his assault again Meth Rezza, she employed the help of the ship's medic, AMU, and took the original bones in his hand. Those original bones are in Meth's possession. AMU\u00a0replicated them and replaced them during Sheik's torture. Meth used Sheik's hand bones to create a personal back scratcher. Isn't that just great? \u2605 Any of Zelda's talent for the racetrack comes from Jak, who's taken some form of delight in teaching her. Along with it, she's got a special entourage specifically for racing. \u2605 Zelda's personal inventory includes:\u00a0the Seal of Mar (Jak), a white fishing hat (Kevas), a blue hairpiece (Hazar), a teddy bear (Zeke), a purple bracelet (Reiner), a box of home-made chocolates (Herz), a cloak (Odette), a picture of Impa, and a snow sculpture of herself (Sal -- which of course doesn't last when the snow melts, but the thought is appreciated). \u2605 Sheik's personal inventory includes:\u00a0a white dickie, scarf, and a smooth chain (Haine), homemade chocolates (Hazar), The Grimm Fairytales (Mimmi), and a discman, earphones, and a few classical CDs (Bryn). \u2605 Zelda's traditional Hylian garb details the Eye of the Sheikah below the Triforce on her tabard. It's very small, however, so there's a chance that others may not notice it. This can either be due to the Sheikah and their connection to Hyrule's Royal Family, or this may be a hint toward Sheik and Zelda's connection. \u2605 There is a possibility that like Impa's facial tattoos, the other members of the Sheikah may have bodily markings. This has not been discouraged. Likewise, it has not been specifically stated. In a portrayal of Sheik and Zelda where they are different people, it is not a long reach to say Sheik likely has bodily tattoos somewhere.Zelda's Relationships  (Status is reflected with \u2666's and \u2665's. \u2666 to \u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666 is minimum to maximum for dislike or fear. \u2665 to \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 is minimum to maximum for acquaintances and beloved people.) Updated: 06/12/2010 \u2022 Damas: (\u2665\u2665\u2665) Jak's father and the king of Spargus. He's respectable, wise, and knows how to take initiative. Zelda hopes that by spending time with him, she can improve upon her own leadership skills. He's aware of Zelda and Jak's relationship and doesn't seem to disapprove. Zelda needs to spend more time with him. \u2022 Daxter: (\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665) Not the same as the old Daxter, but Zelda adores him all the same. He's so cute, so adorable, so squeezable, and for as flirtatious as he is, he's still very considerate to her. \u2022 Erol: (\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666) The commander of the Krimzon Guard beneath Baron Praxis and Jak's rival. Her plan to get into his head failed and in consequence Zelda severed ties with him. Erol knows about the connection between Sheik and Zelda. He's not an easy man to compromise with, but Zelda will use force if she has to in order to keep his mouth shut. \u2022 Ganondorf {TP}: (\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666) She has only recently come to learn that Ganondorf is not the same man guilty of killing her father. He's also not the same man Sheik betrayed in the seven year span. In consequence, he doesn't know that Zelda and Sheik share the same form, and Zelda's hatred has been partially misplaced. Because he's related to that man, however, Zelda still takes most of what he says with a grain of salt. Ganondorf's main motive is still to take her piece of the Triforce, as far as she knows. She wonders where he's placed his irritations into. \u2022 Gideon: (\u2665\u2665\u2665) He's a really great guy, sweet and kind. He makes her think of Link a lot, except perhaps not quite so irrational. She finds him a useful ally and hopes he'll be around a long time to come, and if not, then she hopes he'll go back to a wonderful world, because he deserves all of the finer things in life. She does, however, wish he would just call her by name. \u2022 Jak: (\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665) A Havenite known as the son of Damas, King of Spargus. In an intricate tale, Jak became known as 'Mar', the great leader of Haven, and to some degree, a form of a god. He's foolish, brash, irrational, and reckless. He's lived a difficult life and somehow survived the madness that comes with being filled with Dark Eco, just one of the many energy forms from his home world. Zelda loves him with every beat of her heart and it seems that he might very well reciprocate. \u2022 Kage: (\u2665\u2665\u2665) A soldier from his home world, who's indirectly responsible for keeping Zelda's interest in archery. Due to outside interference, Kage was given something special of Zelda's--and not in the material form. She holds, however, a very vague romantic interest in him. The aftermath has forced her to hold her guard up. When he's not propositioning her, Zelda likes him best. She's promised to set him free from the boat, even if it means staying with him. \u2022 Kevas: (\u2665\u2665\u2665) The troll she once thought of as her older brother. He doesn't remember his former time on the ship, and Zelda's grown up since they've seen each other, but she still cares about him. It seems like he wants to pick up right where he left off. Zelda's apprehensive about complicating things for him this time, however. She's eager to show him just how capable she is on her own. \u2022 The Major: (\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665) A cybernetic woman who has seen many things in her time. She's wise, a little aloof, inconspicuous, and can be considered cold. Zelda respects her and holds her in high regard, looking to win her 'approval' with her actions and diplomacy, rather than coming off as foolish. Zelda views the Major as... a bit of a motherly figure. \u2022 Meth: (\u2665\u2665) A woman of the crew who appears to work on repairs. Zelda doesn't know her very well, but she seems to respect her. Zelda was responsible for returning Meth's blueprints to her, and question her on their purpose. She believes Meth is truly sincere and doesn't wish any harm on the ship's passengers. And if not the ship as a whole--then surely Zelda's secure position. She doesn't know of Sheik's aggression toward her. \u2022 Nabooru: (\u2665\u2665\u2665) Zelda can't say she's personally very close to the Sage of Spirit. She respects her, however, and holds her in high regard. The Gerudo is confident and ambitious, an impeccable leader for her people, even if she should lead hers differently from how Zelda leads Hyrule. Zelda relies on her to have her back and to support her. Although, she can't say she knows what Nabooru thinks of her in the least. \u2022 Razer: (\u2666\u2666\u2666) He tends to mock her often. As a result, Zelda doesn't take much of what he says seriously. In fact, she's pretty certain he's just playing everyone for a fool and doesn't trust him to any extent. They do, on occasion have some very interesting conversations, and not all of them end badly. \u2022 Zeke: (\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665) He runs Sergei's Bar and Grill on the 10th deck. Zelda met him when he was in desperate need of medication, perhaps an after-effect to the mutiny that was staged before she arrived. He has been working on teaching her how to cook. Unfortunately, her first attempt and her impatience caused her to bring the oven to explode, and the kitchen was ultimately damaged quite badly and in need of repairs. It has since then been repaired. She holds Zeke in a high standing and used to view him as a tutor of sorts. Nowadays, he's like an older brother. \u2022 Zelda {TP}: (\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665) Her... great-great-great granddaughter (although Zelda tends to simply refer to her as 'granddaughter'). It's awkward. Zelda holds a tension for her descendant, believing that next to her, she is incapable of properly ruling Hyrule. She feels like she must alter herself for the benefit of her relation, and once again finds herself confined to the role of her title--someplace that Zelda really doesn't want to be any longer. That aside, being the nurturing sort and knowing the connection, Zelda holds a great love and adoration for her.Sheik's Relationships  (Status is reflected with \u2666's and \u2665's. \u2666 to \u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666 is minimum to maximum for dislike or fear. \u2665 to \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 is minimum to maximum for acquaintances and beloved people.) Updated: 06/12/2010 \u2022 Brynhildr Dottir: (\u2665\u2665\u2665) The woman responsible for making Haine's birthday what it needed to be with regards to food. She certainly knows how to alter an awkward situation. Or make it more awkward. \u2022 Erol: (\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666) Erol's hit a new low with Sheik. Just when he was beginning to accept him, Erol goes and does something ridiculously foolish. For the protection of his other half, Sheik would prefer it more if Zelda didn't associate herself with his type, or anyone considered a Spargan or a Havenite for that matter. \u2022 Every Havenite Ever: (\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666) It's just easier to say that Sheik really dislikes every child of the Precursors, mostly because of things Jak and Erol have done. Never mind that Zelda had a hand in it all. Serously, though. He doesn't like any of them, even the charming ones like Phoenix and Razer. \u2022 Ganondorf {TP}: (\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666) Ganondorf's attempts to extract Zelda's Triforce piece have got Sheik on edge, even if he cannot be around to show it. Like Erol, Sheik would rather keep Zelda far, far away from him. On the other hand, he can't deny that if it weren't for Ganondorf's advances, Jak wouldn't have come along again. Perhaps Sheik should be thanking the Gerudo instead. \u2022 Jak: (\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666) Sheik knows about Jak. He knows he came to Zelda's rescue. He knows that Zelda and Jak are in this whole 'in love' nonsense again, but Sheik is less than happy about it. After what happened the first time, although it was with entirely good reasoning, Sheik concerns over Zelda's feelings and expects the very worst. Jak has no place with Hyrule's princess and when Sheik presents himself again, he's determined to make his point to the other elf. \u2022 Lily: (\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665) Haine's younger sister, and apparently Sheik's by practice. He certainly cares about her to a great extent. She's very important to him. Sheik will go to almost any length to protect her. \u2022 Meth: (\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666) After her nonsense with the blueprints of Kakariko, Sheik holds an animosity for her. He is guilty of physically assaulting her. He suffered repercussions at her hands with the help of AMU. \u2022 Nabooru: (\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665) Sheik considers Nabooru a vital asset to Hyrule's freedom. She played a very important part in the Imprisonment War and while she was under Ganondorf's grasp, Sheik wanted to do all he could to keep an eye on her. He defines her as being very close and in any particular situation would gladly raise arms to fight at her side. \u2022 The Major:\u00a0(\u2665\u2665) He respects her. She's good to have in a fight. She's good to have as support. He doesn't quite understand why Zelda likes her so much, but he does like her for his own reasons. \u2022 Zelda {TP}: (\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665) Sheik is exceedingly fond of her. He adores her, wishes to protect her although she doesn't need it, and holds her very dear to him. By textbook theory, he loves her, but Sheik will never admit it and never say it out loud. He certainly does hold her as his highest priority, aside from his own obligations.Specific Timeline June 2009 July 2009 August 2009 September 2009 October 2009 November 2009 December 2009 January 2010 February 2010 March 2010 April 2010 May 2010  [IRL hit Zelda's player very, very hard for this month and Zelda and Sheik were pretty much absent for the entire month.

He was in the middle of writing a story about a handsome prince who was fighting a nasty raven, whom he sealed away by shattering his own heart. But, the story seemed to stop, trapping the characters in limbo-- until the man continued the story, long after his own death. In Gold Crown Town, the place where stories and reality intermingles, the plot was at a standstill. Bored, the man decided to add a new character to the story: A little duck. Now, this little duck was just a completely ordinary duck. She quacked, she swam, she ate bread. One day, she saw a beautiful boy-- who, certainly, could only be a prince-- dancing ballet near her pond. His eyes looked so sad and lonely, she just wanted to see him smile. She cared for him, she wanted to help him so badly. The man thought this was great. How sweet! How innocent! How naive! He gave her a magic pendant so she could turn into a girl. And, with that magic pendant to become a girl, she could also turn into the mythical Princess Tutu, who also appeared in the story of The Prince and the Raven. Now that she was a girl, she could attend the ballet academy where the prince was! She made friends, and began to learn to dance. But that doesn't make for a very interesting story, now does it?  So, to make the Prince smile again, Duck (as Princess Tutu) must gather the shattered shards of Prince Mytho's heart and return them to him. But that's a dangerous action, truly a dangerous action-- because, aren't those shards the only thing sealing the Raven in place? Through her time as Princess Tutu, Duck begins to question what is part of the story, what's real, and who she really is. Is she a girl? Is she Princess Tutu? Or is she really just a little duck, useless to everyone around her? She does make friends of enemies, and enemies of friends. In order to not give away the story's ending, let's just say that she's had a chance to have a pas de deux with the one person she thought she wanted it with, but the story's still far from over back home. Can it go on without her, though?Personality  Duck is a bit of a spaz. She tends to blather on and on when a single sentence would do, and she tends to be on the self-deprecating side of humor. In spite of that, she's very sweet and innocent, and she really gives her all to help those she loves. She's VERY clumsy, in both speech and movement. Her friends often compare her to a duck-- ha ha-- because of her eager nature and eagerness. She really wants to please people, and will try her hardest to do so, unless that person proves themselves to be Not Very Nice. She has an innocent view of the world, and but sees the gray in the black and white of \"good\" and \"evil\". She will always try to find the good in people, where she can.Abilities and Powers  Duck, thanks to Drosselmeyer and the necklace he gave her, has the ability to maintain a human form so long as she doesn't behave or speak like a duck. (She tends to quack when she's surprised.) However! Other than the whole duck-and-human thing, Duck can also become Princess Tutu! Princess Tutu can do several things, all of them are non-combat-oriented, ha ha. -She can dance like a Prima Ballerina. -She can create magic vines and flowers from nowhere, though this will be dampened on the boat. -She can help you work through your problems with a remarkable amount of insight. Yep. Princess Tutu, ladies and gents.Extra Notes  TBAOther Stuff, Links  AppPlayers  The \"muns\" of the Failboat!Haine Rammsteiner Canon information  Much of Haine's past is a mystery, even to himself. He is unable to recall anything before waking up into the darkness with his 'collar' around his neck and meeting Lily as he emerged from the corridor. After talking for a few minutes, trying to figure out where they were before being interupted by Einstellson's pets, Kenny; which sent Lily flying into a wall with a flick of the wrist and the albino suffering from a gash that went across his chest. Professor Angelica Einstellson, stopped Kenny from doing any more damage, was pleased to see that Haine had recovered and her experiment was successful. Haine watched in horror to witness Lily smiling wickedly as she tore pieces of the same Kenny that had attacked her. One by one, the other children held against their wills and with their own collars around their necks were triggered into a blood lust fury and eventually, reached Haine who was held in Angelica's arms, her whispers slowly becoming into shouting orders right beside his ear. Awakening from his sudden black out, he was greeted with a bloody scene, missing limbs and sobs. Spotting Lily from afar, Haine paniced when she turned to him, fearing that she would attack him and have the same expression as before. Instead, she approached him and clung, crying and asking questions that no one was answering and calling Haine her brother.\n\nLater, the albino eventually met Giovanni and became 'brothers'. At an unknown date, after many tests and excerises, the children, Giovanni, Lily & Haine; were pited against each other. Within a beserk rage, Haine had won, only to awake to a gorey aftermath. Lily was broken in half, but she was smiling, carassing Haine's face as she told him her dying words before the albino crushed her skull with his own hands.\n\nUnable to recall what happened afterwards, Haine was eventually found by a blind priest with a lolita dress obbession named Bishop, who took him in and made him healthy once again. A few years later, Haine was working for Bishop & Granny Lisa, jobs of various types and was paired up with a man with an eyepatch who would go psychotic if he didn't have his cigarettes named Badou Nails. Dishing out pain to their enemies that got in their way~ Even though Haine tried to keep his neck ring hidden from the public and refused to be within close proximity of women due to the fear he had developed from the hellish events during experimentation. He picked up two guns, a white Mauser that is always chained to his pants and a black Luger; they represent some sort of symbolism.\n\nDuring one night stroll through the corrupt streets of the Underground, minding his own business, a cloaked girl ran past, being chased by thugs from which she had escaped from. He didn't get involved, that is until he caught glimpse of two small white wings on the girl's back. Disposing of the thugs, fairly easy, the albino took her with him. At the motel, he questioned his thought process before understanding that she was, like him. Trying to coax her into talking, he realized that she was a mute because of her wings. She moved to comfort him, but he jolted away, tense and cracking from memories of Lily's death. Admist of this break down, the door was knocked down and two thugs were rushing for the girl while to kill Haine. Recovering quickly, he shot both down and told her to hurry up; only to walk right into a shotgun blast. The blasts that followed sent Haine through a window and falling at least three stories to the ground. Once his heart started to function again and the wounds healed, he returned to Bishop's to get suited up before storming the brothel that the winged mute was taken to, while dragging Badou along as a distraction. It was successful, with her capturer defeated and the exposure of his own neck ring for the reason he didn't die. She was free and Haine took her to Bishop to stay with, soon to find out her name was Nill. He let her stay with Bishop in the church, being clothed by the lolita obbessed priest and the odd trip to visit Granny Lisa.Elegante  Haine can be found either inside his room, on the deck chairs on Deck 3, watching a depressing movie in the library or either in the Kuma-Ko or Buffet.Relationships  Lily - \"Sister\"\nSubaru - Vampire friend\nBrynhildr Dottir - Cougar friend\nIsabella dela Vega - Vampire and wanna-be mother figure.

This is because it is impossible to mock her, because she will destroy you if you do. Erol Canon  The Baron's right-hand man, Erol replaced Torn as the new Commander of the Krimzon Guard. With no fear and no conscience, Erol became the city's tyrannical enforcer. In Haven it was whispered that he was crazy, a trait which Baron Praxis certainly used to his advantage; Erol was also the city's racing champion, holding this honor due to his deadly tactics on the track. (Source: NDI Jak II webpage)Footage  Youtube here (Intro at 2:50); here (beginning through 1:38); here (4:48 and 8:16); here (beginning through 00:23, and his last is at 7:15).Fanon  Erol's surname as given on the Elegante - \"Kadir\" - is not canon. \"Erol\" is a Turkish name meaning \"brave,\" and \"Kadir\" is another Turkish name meaning \"young man.\" Because god knows Erol will never reach old age.Family  Erol comes from a Havenite noble family down on it's luck and all but out of money. His parents refused to accept any change in appearances, however, and disdained to dirty their own hands with things like raising children - even though they couldn't afford for someone else to do it full-time. Erol learned how to take care of himself at quite a young age, and has a few issues from being a latchkey kid. Erol's parents were caught in the Dead Town Massacre. Having been on the scene, Erol expresses little emotion aside from irritation that they were in such an inconvenient place at the wrong time. He certainly feels no regrets, or guilt. Although he didn't kill his parents himself, he's certainly capable of it.Dark Eco  It's widely-accepted fanon that Erol was placed in charge of the Dark Warrior Project (DWP). This Project had it's consequences. The conversion of dark eco to plasma form during the force-channeling process resulted in fumes of vaporized dark eco. All Erol noticed was an acrid smell, but subtle amounts of \"DE\" residue built up in his system. He does not (and never will) have powers of any sort; he's NOT a channeler or even much of an eco-user. But the influence does tip his sanity towards the deep end. Erol is unaware of this effect.Praxis  Anywhere but Praxis' Haven, Erol would eventually have been locked up for good. But he joined the Krimzon Guard, which provided discipline and an outlet for violence, and eventually was promoted to Commander after Torn. Baron Praxis used his high-energy psychosis to his benefit, putting Erol in charge of inhumane prison programs, allowing him to terrorize the citizenry and generally allowing him far more power and authority than any sane person would consider wise. But - for once - Erol had a respect bordering on fear of Praxis, and wasn't interested in taking charge of the city. His loyalty was secure; though he didn't always like being told what to do and would often use his play-acting skills to get what he wanted, he would never EVER betray the Baron. Praxis had leashed a mad dog, and used him to help keep the citizenry on edge and terrified of crossing him.Jak  Questions, anyone? Anyone, questions?Relationships  The Arbiter (++++): The Sangheli is vicious, uncompromising, unprincipled, and makes for fucking awesome backup. Erol would go out of his way for him, and even be annoyed if he disappeared. Batou (-----): Look, you just... stay over there. And we'll be fine. ._. Gideon (-): Gets in the way, but goes down reasonably easy. Herz: Makes a damn good victim. Jak (-----): The former eco experiment gets under his skin now and then, but for the most part Erol likes to do the poking. He loves messing around with Jak to see how deep his psychological hooks go, or just for amusement value... even if it results in getting mauled. Erol's quite cocky about the fact he had a hand in making Jak (i.e. Mar), and will boast about it if given half the chance - in the same breath as he's deriding him for being an Eco Freak. Jinx: Even a better victim than Herz. He's completely incapable of defending himself and a consummate coward, yet still mouths off. And he's too stupid to withhold consent to fight! Fantastic~ Kage (++++): The First Mate speaks Erol's language, but more, he knows the way around the boat and around Redd. He wrangled the Dexter incident so they got off without punishment, and his lead in this put Kage in the spot of \"superior officer\" at least for a few hours. Seeing Kage being tortured by Redd made Erol surprisingly angry, for someone who's incapable of genuine empathy. Also, he  rode that like he stole it. Lily: Because Even cared about her, Erol will look after her. This extends pretty much to making sure she's still breathing. And ensuring she is not defeated by doorknobs. ... All right, and giving her a cuddle when no one else is looking SHUT UP. '80s Link : LOL Motoko Kusanagi (--): If she didn't try to get in the way of his fun, Erol would quite like her. As it is, while he has immense caution regarding her abilities, he's willing to be practically sociable. (The cyborg thing used to severely creep him out, but since becoming a cyborg himself during an age-change event he seems to have gotten over that little tic.) Pamela (---): She really, really should not have used that sleep spell. Erol HATES sedation with a passion. All he needs is the slightest excuse to gut her, and he won't play fair about it. Razer (+ >9000): As mentioned above, Erol is head-over-heels for him. He's arrogant, a top-notch racer, vicious and self-centered. There are many difference between them to be sure - not all of them physical - but that just makes things interesting. Erol doesn't know all the facts about the mob lieutenant but they understand each other. He trusts him implicitly - as much as he trusts himself - and would put himself on the line for Razer without a second's thought. Remy (...): The source of their animosity gone, he's found a bizarre common ground with the bartender on the basis of the definition of insanity and their mothers. Erol likes what he's seen of Remy's ability to be callous, but he still has that \"conscience\" issue. A shame and a waste, but what Erol does like is enough for him to open up an amicable chat here and there. Zelda (?!): Erol hates few things as much as having a prize whipped out from under his nose. In Zelda's case, not only did she slip away from his hooks just when things were getting good, but she proved to have been holding back on him the entire time by consorting with Jak. Her ability to decieve perplexed and infuriated him. Now, she's in a very dangerous position - he doesn't trust her in the slightest, has plenty of motivation to do her harm, and conversely feels a lingering attraction/fascination for her. He's also learned quite a bit about her vulnerable points from the time spent attempting to seduce her. Zelda, be very, very careful.Elegante Timeline  Oh my god Erol's been here a long time For older entries, see: LEGEND: DISCLAIMER: Please note that Erol's characterization has been refined over time.

You name it, Gideon is your man to look out for it! [...] I love that about you, you know.\" ~ Fatin to Gideon \"[...] The first time we met you were babysitting a bunch of kids in trouble. ~ Zoey to GideonCanon Information  About Gideon's Band Life: Gideon serves as the drummer for a now world-famous band known as Cohen's Masterpiece. Formed in San Francisco, California, the band is composed of four members: Mephisticuffs, Gideon, Lucy, and J-Kwon. They played their first official gig at Alice's Free Love Cafe in San Francisco, California on January 4th, 2008. After receiving critical acclamation, they moved out of California and began touring in other parts of America. From thereon they solidified their position in the musical world, appealing to fans not only as a band, but as their sense of being a unified family. It wasn't long until they were known worldwide, and on April 20th, 2008, they received their first acknowledgment as platinum artists.\n\nMany fans expected the band to calm down a little after that, but they continued their rise in the musical world. On September 14th, 2008, they started a brand new tour sporting a new logo and performing a variety of new songs. This lead them to be placed on the Rolling Stone's Rock Immortal listing and then, promptly after that, they were inducted into the Hall of Fame.\n\nAbout Gideon Himself: Gideon is a complex person, more so than his eccentric appearance belies. He has a big heart and a friendly nature about him, functioning mainly as a caretaker, mediator, and at times goofball of the band. Fiercely loyal and strongly dedicated, he'll always back up his bandmates and will be the first there to try and iron out a misunderstanding, even if he has to put himself in harm's way to do it. He is considered to be the voice of reason in the band and has a definite care-free, laid back side to his personality that loves joking around. PERSONALITY\n...When your first meet him: He\u2019ll give you space but then generally become more talkative if you seem like you\u2019re warming up to him. Above all else, he\u2019ll try to make you laugh and smile and brighten your day. He\u2019ll also give hugs if asked.\n...As you know him better (and he likes you): The main thing you\u2019ll notice is that he\u2019ll become vastly more protective, but he won\u2019t do it in a way that makes it feel like he\u2019s trying to smother or stalk you. He\u2019ll always be open for conversation and will drop whatever he\u2019s doing if he feels like you want company, and he\u2019ll start joking around more and more the more he becomes accustomed to you.\n...As you know him better (and he dislikes you): He\u2019ll be generally tight-lipped and quiet, but he won\u2019t be blatantly disrespectful unless you\u2019re grinding his absolute last nerve. Usually he\u2019ll excuse himself from a person\u2019s presence if they insist on offending him, instead of clashing with them.\nPositive Characteristics: He\u2019s good at reading people and acting accordingly. He\u2019s also loyal to a fault and will do virtually anything for someone he cares about, even if it means putting himself in harm\u2019s way. Lucky for him, he\u2019s a very capable fighter (unless he gets drastically outnumbered), so he\u2019s more than capable regarding his protective whims. He\u2019s persistent, and he has a great sense of humor and can easily empathize with someone. In addition, he\u2019s been through a lot in his life, and as such he has expansive and considerable savoir-faire*-- so he\u2019s always able and willing to offer council and consolation if he feels like a person wants or needs it.\n*For those of you who are not familiar with the term, here is its definition. Savoir-faire (n): knowledge of just what to do in any situation; tact.\nNegative Characteristics: He tends to get a overestimate his tolerance when caught up in his friend\u2019s enthusiasm regarding drinking. Also, he\u2019ll get over his head in a heartbeat regarding fights in his vigor to protect someone in danger (say\u2026 one friend amidst ten thugs? Gids\u2019ll be right there. Yeah, not the best idea\u2026). And, if he does end up getting hurt, no matter how severe it is he will always argue against being taken to a hospital; in addition he is prone to fits of self-ashamedness upon injury. Both of these things combined makes it hard for people he knows to care for him. He's not easily discouraged, but he feels horrendously guilty if he felt like he's causing problems or frustration.\nFavorite Color: Blue and gold, and pink as well.\nFavorite Food: ORANGES. Give him oranges and he'll practically be your dog on a leash. Also pretty much anything he can cook with Fatin.\nFavorite Drink: Tea.\nFavorite Animal: Mantids.\nFavorite Instrument: Drums.\nFavorite Remembered Moment in Life: He loves virtually any moments with friends. He also has a great time partying with Mephisticuffs, despite how hungover he ends up afterwards. Also birthdays of any band members (he loves baking cake), and the week he spent in Greece with Fatin, where they started going out.\nLeast Favorite Color: He doesn\u2019t really dislike any colors, although he prefers more vibrant ones.\nLeast Favorite Food: Anything overtly sweet or greasy, but nothing in particular.\nLeast Favorite Drink: Most hard liquors, his stomach has a hard time with them.\nLeast Favorite Animal: Mosquitoes.\nLeast Favorite Instrument: Recorder.\nMost Hated Moment in Life: Well... that's for privileged ears only. Get to know him, he might share it with you.\nHobbies: Anything he can do with his bandmates; drumming, writing silly pieces of side music he knows he\u2019ll never perform, taking care of Vrell, and cooking/baking.\nUsual Mood: Upbeat and joking, with a little hint of being carefree and laid back.\nDrink/Smoke/Drugs: He has low tolerance for drinking, but he\u2019ll go through with it if it\u2019s what his friends are doing. He\u2019ll just end up hungover later on for it. He does not smoke, and hasn\u2019t touched drugs.\n(In)Dependent: He can be independent if he needs to, but since he lives with a band he doesn\u2019t really see the point. He feels an obligation to watch out for said bandmates (and any of his other friends), so he usually won\u2019t be far from their sides, although he\u2019s not helpless without them.\nSoft Spot/Vulnerability: He loves massages and, if he trusts the person, belly rubs (like I\u2019ve mentioned, his stomach is sensitive). If you\u2019re real good at said massages he\u2019ll melt like butter in your hands. His jaws are also sensitive because of his chops. As for a soft spot, well... that obviously belongs to Fatin.\nOpinion on Swearing: He\u2019s not offended by it, but he tries not to use it excessively, feeling it loses some of its effect that way. It still slips out sometimes, though.\nDaredevil VS Cautious: Either, depending on the situation. \nSleeping Pattern: He\u2019s very comfortable at night and can fall into a deep sleep easily. He\u2019ll latch onto pillows without knowing it into his sleep if they\u2019re nearby, or if he\u2019s absolutely exhausted, he\u2019ll just sprawl out as far as he can and pass out. As far as waking up goes, he can get right up if he needs to, although on relaxed days it\u2019ll happen a little slower, and he\u2019ll be a little disoriented and exceedingly docile upon waking up.\nCleanliness/Neatness: Very neat, he\u2019ll keep his belongings orderly, and his clothes clean. He showers nightly and takes great pride in keeping his hair well-kept and soft.\nFears:He has a fear of hospitals, namely, and will always try to avoid being taken to them. He also fears the band breaking up in any way, or becoming irrelevant or useless to anyone he cares about. More than that, he fears anything happening to those he cares about, especially if he could prevent it.\nComforts: Sleeping with warm blankets, plenty of cushions, and Fatin nearby-- all three together are the best! He also loves warm tea and just being near he those he cares about (namely bandmates and his lover); he\u2019s a big softie, really. Easy mornings where he can just lay in bed, and occasional days off, when he has a chance to cook for everyone and just goof off. Stargazing and visiting beaches; he also likes taking walks, or going out and seeing the town, preferably with company. Hugs are also huge comforts for him, and he\u2019s not above friendly cuddling if the other wants it, either (in short, physical contact is not restricted to his partner-- you wanna hug him, go for it!).\nDrunk Type: Overtly happy, he\u2019ll start cracking jokes and laughing really loudly. He feels the affects quickly, though, so after awhile of being off the wall, he\u2019ll start becoming more and more subdued until he eventually passes out. Afterwards, he\u2019ll get hungover (and it\u2019s usually pretty awful because he has weak tolerance), and he\u2019ll usually throw up or just lay around feeling ill. HOW DO THEY ACT WHEN THEY ARE...\nSad: He will try to hide it, but he\u2019s only successful a small fraction of the time (when he disappears randomly at night to go look at the stars, that\u2019s one sign). He doesn\u2019t feel like people should have to waste their time worrying over him, but deep down inside he really does appreciate it.\nHappy: He\u2019s usually happy! And he\u2019ll express it readily, by cracking jokes and sharing laughter, humming or singing quietly to himself.\nAngry: He\u2019ll try to keep it in line, but it\u2019s pretty evident when he\u2019s feeling disgruntled.\nAfraid: He is rarely afraid, but if he does become so he will stutter and hunch over slightly, and usually stand closer to whichever trusted person is nearby.\nLove Someone: Become entirely devoted to them, and try to spend as much time with them as possible. He\u2019ll go out of his way to make them feel truly loved and special.\nHate Someone: He\u2019ll avoid associating with them, but he won\u2019t go out of his way to spark meaningless fights or drama.\nWant Something: If he can't get himself he\u2019ll hint at it gently, almost sheepishly, but he\u2019ll never demand it in a threatening manner.\nConfused: He\u2019ll widen his eyes a little bit and blink, and raise the index finger of one of his hands in a kind of half-pointing gesture. Occasionally he\u2019ll open his mouth to say something but it\u2019ll trail off, and he\u2019ll clamp it shut again. When he realizes how he\u2019s acting, he\u2019ll laugh embarrassedly at himself. EXTRA FACTS!Relationships  Kate Starlen: Gideon's first true friend on the Elegante, she was the one who opened up the possibility of him replacing his instruments; this automatically made her awesome in his mind. He is also happy to have found another musician on board, and is glad to have someone to show him around. Since meeting her, Gideon did his best to look out for her and support her, and values her as his closest friend on the Elegante, often relying on her for emotional support. Since New Year's of 2010, the two have become intimate. J-Kwon: One of Gideon's bandmates-- therefore, he understands the drummer on ways and levels that nobody else on the Elegante does. Gideon trusts J-Kwon from the bottom of his heart and, as such, is protective of the bassist-- though not quite as much as some of the other inhabitants of the boat because if there's one thing he's learned, it's that J-Kwon can take care of himself. Nevertheless Gideon regards J-Kwon to be as important to him as any family and will never be too far from his side, always ready to stand by him and help him out in any way possible. Mimmi Kopanski: A very sweet, if slightly sheltered German girl. His baking biffle. Gideon believes he owes her a life debt, as she saved him by calling AMU after her got seriously injured after venturing into Carnival. The drummer is incredibly protective of her because of this. Gertie Kopanski: Mimmi's adorable younger sister. Gideon think it's sweet how close the two are. He currently feels guilty around Gertie, though, as he was unable to save her from death at another passenger's hands. Autonomous Medical Unit 92-XG-3: Weird robot doctor... thing. Despite the fact that it saved him from death one one occassion, he still feels completely freaked out by its presence. He just doesn't know how to deal with AMU yet. Mikaela Banes: Very nice, good company and a pleasant conversationalist. They are also both from California! Zelda/Sheik: Okay so when he first met her it was a bit awkward, as he's never been in the presence of royalty before... but he managed to break the ice easily with tea. She's diplomatic and formal, but also approachable. He's never met or heard of Shiek. Remy Whitecastle: Elegante's bartender, this guy seems to have a good head on his shoulders and firm people-skills. Gideon finds him trustwothy even if he doesn't necessarily share Remy's interest in the information warfare going on around the ship. Oh, he's also successfully gotten Gids plastered. After getting to know Kate a bit better, being friends with Remy came with proximity and now Gideon truly does appreciate his friendship. This was only amplified after Remy saved Gideon from a would-have-been fatal injury. Brynhildr Dottir: Really bubbly and happy and just generally pleasant to converse with/be around. Samuel: You are pretty damn weird and why were you trying to hock off my girlfriend, again? Lilith: She seems nice enough, but Gideon has only really talked to her once so far. She appreciates his cooking, so she can't be all that bad, right? Herz Hessian: Nice kid, if not a bit shy. He invited Gideon to cook with him in Sergei's, so that's awesome. Fatin: Was Gideon's girlfriend before she disappeared off the boat-- he loved the albino with all his heart and was deeply protective of her. She is currently not on the Elegante, having idled out, and this affected Gideon's emotions and behavior in an extremely negative way until he found solace and love from Kate.Elegante  Deaths: 1 Medic Calls: 2 Warnings & Punishments: 2 As of July 1st, 2010, all warnings and punishments have been wiped clean.Elegante Timeline  I'm modeling this after Erol's page, since it is very organized and I wish to emulate that.

When she was born, her father and Derek's mother, Queen Uberta, decided that their children would be the key to uniting their kingdoms. And so from a very young age, Odette was forced to spend every summer with Derek. The two hated each other for most of their lives and dreaded the months they would have to be together.\u00a0Eventually, however, when they had grown up, Derek and Odette finally saw each other in a different light. They had fallen in love with each other and Derek was eager to have their marriage arranged. But Odette wasn't so sure. She needed to know that Derek loved her. After complimenting her beauty, she thanked him and then asked \"What else?\"\u00a0and much to her disappointment, he replied \"What else is there?\" She left then, unmarried and disappointed in Derek's response. On their way home, Odette and her father were attacked by a vengeful wizard named Rothbart. Years earlier, King William had banished Rothbart for planning to usurp the throne. After killing William, Rothbart kidnapped Odette and placed her under a spell that made her a swan after the moon sets. The spell could only broken by kissing the man she loved, after which he would make a vow of everlasting love and then he must prove it to the world. And the alternative was if she agreed to marry Rothbart and legally give him her father's kingdom. Rothbart took Odette to his castle, where one night she fell asleep and the next day, she woke up on the Elegante.Elegante  Odette was brought on board the Elegante about a week after the death of her father. So far she's enjoying herself. At least Rothbart isn't here. LOL\u00a0NEVER\u00a0MIND~TIME\u00a0LINE!

BUT SUDDENLY he finds Jak, Torn, and Daxter who tell him about the boat and all of it's lovely features.\n21th Jinx gets hungry for a million and a half burgers and meets Herz at the Grille. Since Jinx is incapable of saying the word 'Herz', he dubs the green haired fellow as Mumbles. Jinx harasses him a bit and brings up bad memories before leaving with some booze.\n22nd Jinx doesn't appreciate that all of his ammo was confiscated so he asks passengers for help. Kate tells him about alchemy and Razer offers no help at all. Actually, he offers negative amounts of help since he just pisses Jinx off.\n23rd Jinx hits on Ashelin and doesn't know what that Carnival place really is.\n25th Jinx finds out that there's a FIRE on deck eleven. Isabella tells him to ignore it and Zeke tells Jinx about marshmallows. But then TORN comes to offer help with Jinx's issue. He tells him to dump a bucket of water on it but Jinx doesn't have buckets so he uses a water bottle. His name is now 'Numbnuts.'\nMarch\n5th Jinx is turned into a twelve year old. I know, it's tragic.\n15th Jinx gets into an intense argument with Razer about Jak's age since they are preparing for his birthday. Razer thinks he's 19 and Jinx thinks he's 18. Time Warp~\n19th Jinx is pissed that he still doesn't know who murdered Krew and decides to be mopey all day. It turns out that Lily is an alien, Holms is a bastard, Ashelin is heartless, and Remy is a mass murderer.\n21st NOBODY SAID THAT IT WAS FOURTH WALL DAY WHAT THE HELL. An orca comes to scream words at Jinx but it only gets better when Dark Jak hands Jinx his ass. There are two mysterious guests from the human world then some singing turtle whatever thing came.\n26th Jinx decides that it would be an excellent idea to invite Xanth to his room for a few shots. Jinx finds out that the kid's only sixteen and all of his plans are ruined. Neither can read but both are good with their hands. This was the start of something amazing. 30th Have some clear evidence that Jinx never ever bathes. His clothing is ripe and crusty so he begs for some rags from the other passengers. Xanth doesn't help at all, Jak thinks Jinx is disgusting FOR SOME REASON, and Rochelle tells him that he is disgusting. April\n6th Some freaky screaming girl noises invade everything ever so Jinx, being the brave brave soul that he is, decided to start a search party. Catpaw doesn't think there will be fighting, Xanth kind of not really wants to go, and Marco could be very useful.\n11th Jinx joins a group of dumbasses risk takers to go kill JennJenn. As predicted, they all get their shit rocked. Twice if they lasted the first round. Jinx survived the first with an arm and a leg remaining then died of blood loss from the second go.\n12 You know the best thing about dying? Coming back naked. Sadly, most don't like the freedom that comes with nudity and that 'most' is Feenie. Phoenix was pissed then almost burned Jinxes garments but decided to wash them instead like a polite civilized person. Xanth washes the top and Keira finds his scarf. Surprisingly, Jinx manages to locate the rest of his clothing. 16th Jinx meets up with Xanth at the buffet but he has the idiot ball. Yah, Jinx can be more stupid. He says a bunch of stupid crap before giving the ball to Xanth. Xanth insults Jinx's ears and he gets pissed. When Xanth apologizes, Jinx tells him to grow a pair and stop apologizing all the time. He apologizes YET AGAIN so Jinx bitch slaps him, Xanth makes Kuki cry shrinks into the ground and Jinx feels bad and gives him a hug. Jinx gets punished the next day or something. 18th Jinx takes his drunk ass and writes some sort of apology to Xanth that no one could read. Kuki couldn't read it because she typed it with her eyes closed. Xanth forgave him and said he was crazy without saying it out loud.\nBackdated What else could be expected of Jinx than to put children in danger? He grabs Link ans Lily and takes them to the top of the lighthouse to get some of the fire to make bombs. There is 'blood' everywhere and Jinx is scared. When they get to the top, they find a heavy chest that Lily, with her alien arms, carries down the steps. They open the chest and it explodes into candy.\n29th Jinx finds Xanth on the beach, clearly lost. He offers to take him to town but is interrupted by Kitami who has no inside voice. He likes to be mean and yell things in Japanese so Jinx tells him to fuck off so he leaves. May\n4th Xanth is clearly having women issues when Jinx finds him in a whorehouse on the island. He tells him to get some balls and to stop being in denial and that grabbing ass is the way to be. Jinx decides to be the great example of an adult that he is and approach a hooker. He chats her up then grabs her ass, only to receive a slap. Xanth laughs because he is heartless and Jinx draws a stupid diagram that makes no sense.\n5th Jinx finds the hottest woman ever at the Lobster party and decides to work is Jinx magic on her. He flirts the hell out of Mimmi until Gideon shows up mad as hell. Jinx is about to slap a bitch when Mimmi starts being too damn cute. Is he really going to fight in front of his potential wife? 10th Jinx flips his shit yet again when he realizes that he cannot open his door and tells everyone that he thought that the island was a dream. Edward offers no help at all but does tell him about alchemy. Kari thinks that there is a reason they are locked in their rooms and Jinx shoots her down. He then mentions Xanth because that is his OTP and tries to find out more about their current relationship. Mimmi offers no help but does tell Jinx that smashing the door is a bad idea. 13th Jinx is absolutely gross nasty and asks if anyone wants to teach him about that whole hygiene thing. Phoenix assumes that he isn't being serious and Jinx thinks that it is the funniest thing ever.The Epic of Jinx and Handy  tehkukikookie (8:46:12 PM): hey, jinx and his hand have something special now\n Angrus (8:46:23 PM): it's the only one who really understands him\n Alma (8:46:27 PM): *snerts\n tehkukikookie (8:46:30 PM): it really is\n Shane (8:46:43 PM): Jinx's hand: I think we need some time apart. \n Wofl (8:46:53 PM): XDDDD\n tehkukikookie (8:46:54 PM): Jinx: IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE LIKE THIS\n tehkukikookie (8:47:02 PM): Jinx: talk? 8D\n Shane (8:47:08 PM): Jinx's hand: YOU DON'T CLEAN ANYTHING DOWN THERE! \n tehkukikookie (8:47:12 PM): JKDLG:SFDGLHKL\n Cassie (8:47:18 PM): XD\n Angrus (8:47:19 PM): /can't breathe\n tehkukikookie (8:47:20 PM): Jinx: baby, i can change\n Angrus (8:47:50 PM): OKAY GOING TO IDLE SO I CAN TAG\n Shane (8:47:52 PM): Jinx's hand: No Jinx, I just can't do this anymore\n tehkukikookie (8:47:55 PM): OKAY <3\n tehkukikookie (8:48:14 PM): Jinx: so, this's it. after all that we've done together\n Ashufaec (8:48:16 PM): lol\n Ashufaec (8:48:25 PM): Roll: ... is he gonna cut it off now? \n Wofl (8:48:26 PM): /dies\n tehkukikookie (8:48:32 PM): Jinx: /gets a saw\n Shane (8:48:33 PM): Jinx's hand: I've found someone else.

Enjoy.Xellos  \"That is a secret!\"Background  Xellos is a delightful bastard high-ranking Monster from the anime series Slayers. And, to explain his background, I, unfortunately, have to start at the very beginning. Once upon a time, there was a war going on. This was started by the five subordinates of Ruby Eye Shabranigdu because they wanted to awaken their lord. Who would be that Ruby Eye Shabranigdu guy that I was talking about. This was the War of the Monster's Fall. Well, long story short, at one point in the war, the subordinates had to step back from the front to put up a barrier so they could defeat one of their enemies uninterrupted. It was at that time that Greater Beast Zelas Metallium created Xellos, the lovable scamp that he is, to go fight in the war directly in her place. Now, most of the subordinates created two servants-- a general, and a priest. Zelas, however, poured that power into one Monster. Therefore, Xellos is the strongest Monster in his race with the exception of the five subordinates. And, of course, the Demon King Ruby Eye Shabranigdu. So, Xellos starts following orders with a smile! He killed thousands of Golden Dragons in the war singlehandedly, and is understandably hated by them to this day. Seriously, it was singlehandedly, as you can see here. We don't know much of his wartime exploits, but it's enough for the cast of Slayers to know to not get in a fight with Xellos ever. In any case, after the war, Xellos' orders are to track down copies of the Claire Bible manuscripts and destroy them. The Claire Bible holds a wealth of information that would be very dangerous to the Monster Race if humans were able to access it, so... Xellos gets to set things on fire. That lasts for a thousand years or so, give or take a decade, until he meets the Slayers cast. Oh, the fantastic times they will have. The major plot points of the series for Xellos only are summarized below: Xellos introduces himself to the cast as the Mysterious Priest, who is looking for a stray manuscript of the Claire Bible for the temple he works for. Which is not a lie, it's just not... the whole truth. He follows the party around, mostly enjoying the chaos they always leave in their wake. Of course, he's under orders to do so, but he's mostly trying to keep them away from manuscripts-- so he feeds them information that is never entirely verified, oftentimes too good to be true, sending them on the most random misadventures-- everything from cross-dressing to get into a town of only women, to playing a game of super-powered tennis. Finally, the plot shows up, in the form of Lord Gaav. Through means of Being Really Fucking Strong, he beats the ever-not-loving shit out of Xellos to get information out of him, which he doesn't give him a lot of. Gaav is trying to find out what Hellmaster Phibrizzo's plans are. Xellos, being under orders from Hellmaster, should know some of them, right? He certainly does know some things-- but some are, of course, secrets. Gaav later does REALLY SERIOUS damage to Xellos, pretty much keeping him out of the fun for the rest of the season, at least until the season finale, where he mostly is a bystander.  In season 3, Slayers Try, Xellos is under new orders-- stop the big bad played by Shedder from TMNT 2k3 from summoning a bigger bad, because if something's going to destroy the world, it's going to be the Monster Race. Alternatively, if he can just convert the Big Bad to being a Monster, that's cool too. His bargaining chip here is that, after he ran off after being so injured last season, Lina ended up killing Gaav. Which was, you know, well and good at the time. Except the big bad in the third Season, Valgaav, was one of his loyal servants and wants Lina dead. Xellos says that he will personally eliminate Lina Inverse if Valgaav becomes a Monster. And then they fight and Valgaav (ultimately) kicks Xellos' ass there. He spends most of this season at odds with a Golden Dragon newly added to Lina's party named Filia Ul Copt, who really brings out a less-than-smiley side of Xellos.Personality  Zel: \u201cOne more thing: That sneak Xellos is involved in all of this somehow, too. \u2026\u201d Pokota: \u201cYou mean that guy who says \u2018that\u2019s a secret\u2019 about everything?\u201d Lina: \u201cHe\u2019s not someone who acts without a plan. If he moves, there\u2019s a reason. He\u2019s definitely up to something.\u201d The best word to describe Xellos would be duplicitous. He never does much of anything unless it has benefit for himself, be that benefit to help him carry out orders from his higher-ups, or just his own amusement. He always, always smiles. He is forever smiling in an attempt to keep up his friendly-trickster-priest persona. Some people are a bit uncomfortable with the constant smiling, and even the cast notes after he introduces himself as the \"Mysterious Priest\" that he couldn't be up to any good with a name like that. However, when he opens his eyes, shit will, in fact, get very real. Xellos is always polite, referring to everyone as \"Mister, Missus, Miss,\" etc. (In Japanese, everyone was \"-san\", obviously.) The only person Xellos has ever been outright rude to was Filia, and, well. She started it. The jerk likes to have his fun, certainly, and will prompt other people around him to cause trouble for his amusement. Monsters, on the whole, are ruled by Chaos. Their ultimate goal is to sink the world back into the Sea of Chaos from whence it came, thereby destroying it. So, they feed off of and are drawn to chaos. Which means, the more miserable people near him are, the happier Xellos will probably appear to be. There are exceptions, of course. Xellos appears to do a lot of things. He appears to be sympathetic, he appears to feel regret-- and, while he does, to some extent, most of his outer facade is completely fake. He can be downright cruel when he gets a mind to, but it's incredibly rare. He himself has claimed to be at odds with what he does. He has a very contradictory nature. So much of what his actions are in the series, however, are directly related to orders he has from his superiors.  Xellos: \u201cOh, I make it a point to never lie!\u201d This is a very important thing to note about Xellos. While I believe I've said it before, it bears repeating. He doesn't lie. It's not his style. He withholds the truth, he doesn't tell all of the story, etc. He also will say, \"That is a secret,\" if, that is, in fact, a secret. Why make up a lie when you can tell the truth? The truth, being, of course, \"That is a secret.\" Xellos is likely to get very bored, very quickly. Hopefully the passengers never stop being interesting.Abilities and Powers  Sections of this will be copied from his application because that was pretty all-encompassing. Due to the nature of Xellos\u2019 existence in the original series, he is ridiculously overpowered. There are only five monsters and a couple of demon gods stronger than he is in the original canon, so, one must ask, \u201cHow will he be cut back for the boat?\u201d As I explain his abilities, I will mostly be focusing on how severely handicapped he will be on the boat, and I will explain how his limitations should work within his own canon.  Xellos\u2019 first ability in Slayers is one very crucial to his nature. Xellos exists largely on the Astral Plane within the original canon, as the rest of his race also do. The short version of what that link has to say is that everything, including humans, have an Astral body. It could be argued that the Astral Body is the in-series equivalent to the soul, for humans. Furthermore, if a human\u2019s Astral Body is destroyed, they will be left a lifeless shell on the physical plane. However, Monsters like Xellos exist on the Astral Plane first, and project a physical form to the physical plane. That human-shaped body everyone knows and loves is merely an illusion. In the original canon, to harm Xellos, you had to use a weapon that could affect him on the Astral Plane, not simply on the physical one. This will not be the case on the Elegante, as Xellos will be limited to that physical form. Because of this crucial limitation, Xellos\u2019 magic will also be severely cut down. Xellos\u2019 original abilities were broken down as thus: the abilities he has because of his race (that of a Monster), skills in Black magic, the teleportation and Super Speed, and the ability to either negate magic effects or to not be affected by magic at all. Furthermore, because of his existence on the Astral Plane, he appears in the series to never get tired (except when grievously injured, and most of the time he will attempt to keep up appearances) and there are times when he can just retreat to the Astral Plane entirely to either avoid attack or avoid detection. So. Fortunately for the people who he will inevitably piss off on the Elegante, most of those do not apply. Here is an itemized list of the effects of being tied to his human shape: \u2192 Xellos\u2019 offensive magic will be drastically reduced. Not only is he incapable of the wanton destruction that gained him a terrible reputation, what few attack spells he can still perform will, after a few attacks, tire him out pretty quickly. \u2192 Xellos\u2019 transformative ability (that ties to his abilities as a Monster) will also be limited, further reducing his power. While he will be able to change to his beast form for attacks (which would appear as a whirlwind or a cone of shadow), and while he will be able to summon one of the attacks that uses part of that Astral essence to hurt things, he will be forced to retreat soon thereafter, as the process will also exhaust him\u2014 a serious limitation, considering that he has never really experienced such an effect from such a simple attack before. \u2192 Xellos\u2019 ability to Run The Hell Away\u2014 be it either his super speed (for lack of a better term) or his ability to teleport will still be intact, but it, like the use of his other magic, will weaken him to some extent. Unless it is necessary, he won\u2019t use it as much. In addition to that, while he will still hover off the ground like he normally can, he won\u2019t be using it as much, in an attempt to conserve energy. He will only be able to teleport to passenger-approved areas of the boat. \u2192 Finally, Xellos\u2019 skills with negating magic will also be nerfed. While he can still negate magic, he will be limited to a set number of blocks before he starts getting tired. Furthermore, he will not simply be immune to some magic as he is in his original canon\u2014 he will actually have to put forth the effort to block it. While I wish I could say \u201cthat\u2019s all, folks,\u201d there are two more things I need to talk about: first, Xellos\u2019 silver tongue. The bastard can talk, and he\u2019s very, very manipulative. While he claims that he \u201cmakes it a point to never lie,\u201d it is debatable, obviously, how true of a statement that is. He keeps lots of secrets. He puts on an amazing face\u2014 that of a happy \u201ctrickster priest\u201d. He delights in the spread of madness and mayhem. Beyond his skill in manipulation, he is a gifted strategist, and always has a plan behind his actions. He\u2019s pretty good at acting out the Xanatos Gambits of his superiors to remarkable effect. He sees worth in every relationship, he looks for every opportunity to manipulate everyone he knows. Secondly, and this is more of a weakness than an ability, Monsters feed off misery. To quote the Kanzaka Wiki, \u201cA [monster]'s source of energy (food) is sh\u014dki, the miasma produced by humans and other beings (even manifested lesser demons) when they experience negative emotions .\" So, your suffering is a feast for Xellos. On the opposite end of the spectrum, positive feelings seem to cause effects on monsters that range anywhere from a mild nausea to pain, nausea and general incapacitation. This is generally played for comedy in the series.  Here is a great clip of him not really even trying in a fight, though this will be closer to what his powers are here on the Elegante.Appearance  Xellos appears to be a 20-something priest, with a pretty odd bowl cut sort of haircut going on. His hair is purple, as are his eyes if you ever get the chance to see them. Because the form we see in the series is just a projection Xellos puts there from the Astral Plane, he wears the same clothes pretty much all the time-- this likely won't change too much on the boat, though he might abandon his mantle sometimes. He doesn't have his staff, though he does still have his bag. Not that there was very much in it...Extra Notes  Believe it or not, it is less confusing for me to use the English dub terms from this series, so there are some variations in spellings and names from translation to translation. The company that dubbed Slayers was noooot the best for translation? So. You know. Major differences of note: \u00a4 Mazoku = Monster. This can refer to a single Mazoku/Monster, or the Monster Race. \u00a4 Shabranigdu = Shabranigdo. ...this is not actually less confusing, it's just how they pronounced the name in the dub. I'll be spelling it as Shabranigdu, but it is pronounced in the dub as \"do\" and you know what, /FLIPS SLAYERS TRANSLATORS \u00a4 Xelloss = Xellos. I have always spelled his name with one 's'? Some of the fandom spells it with two? Does it really mater? \u00a4 K\u014dma War = The War of the Monster's Fall. The kanji for that being \u964d\u9b54\u6226\u4e89. Not that I know any of those kanji. \u00a4 Garv = Gaav. Random. Nuts to you, Slayers, and your ridiculous, ridiculous translations. There was one instance that was mistranslated in the dub where one character's grandfather was hypothesized to be his \"grandfather and great-grandfather.\" Fortunately, it was supposed to be \"or\", not \"and.\" Other fun instances of mistranslation (perhaps purposeful mistranslation) gone awry is a scene in the third Season where Xellos says to someone in the original version, \"That's the Filia I know.\" In the dub, the line, inexplicably is \"That's the dragon I love.\" Which is funny, because, you know. Xellos is incapable of love. Just, you know. Sayin'.Elegante Timeline  June \u21925th Xellos practically sneaks on board, which is absolutely perfect for himOther Stuff, Links, Random Facts  App. It's also available in his journal. A Roguish Priest! His Name is Xellos! Episode 2 of the Second Season, the first episode where Xellos appears! Enjoy his old dub voice, ladies and gentlemen, because in the older seasons? That would be David Brimmer, credited as David Moo in the series. In the newest seasons he's played by Michael Sinterniklaas. So, you know. Xellos sounds remarkably like Leonardo from TMNT 2k3 in the new dub. He's played by the fabulous and ridiculously talented Akira Ishida in the original Japanese version. \"Ring the Bell and Good Things Will Happen.\" The writers like picking on him.Charlotte La Bouff Canon Information  WARNING, HERE BE SPOILERS History in a nutshell: Charlotte grew up with everything she wanted from her father, the sugar mill \u201cking\u201d of New Orleans. Tiana\u2019s mother made dresses for Charlotte when she was a girl, and would bring Tiana along and read the girls fairy tales. The two became best friends as they grew up, sharing their dreams and ambitions. Now that Charlotte\u2019s all grown up, she is a loud and easily excitable young lady. Though not always the brightest crayon in the box, Charlotte has a big heart just like her father. When she arrives on the MS Elegante, \u201cPrince Naveen\u201d had just danced with her at her masquerade ball. However, when she came over to Tiana, she found that Tiana had somehow gotten covered in jam and other food substances and brought her upstairs to give her a new dress. After making sure Tiana was changed and ready go to (tiara and all), she hiked up her dress and moved to run \u201cback into the frey.\u201d However, she never made it back into said \u201cfrey\u201d, instead winding up on the MS Elegante as soon as she closed the door to her room behind her. Abilities/Powers: Charlotte does not seem to have any special powers or abilities. Strength: Physically, Charlotte's not a very strong person. But she has a big heart, and really does care about other people. Weakness: Charlotte trusts pretty easily, and is also pretty gullible because she is a bit self-absorbed.Despite the fact that she does care for other people, she can be a bit oblivious to other people's problems. Personality: Charlotte comes part-in-parcel with a bright, over-eager, bubbly personality. She is loud and vivacious for the most part, and quite friendly. She knows exactly what she wants, and will go after it with the force of a hurricane. However, she also suffers from the 'spoiled little rich girl' syndrome. When she doesn't get what she wants, she kind of throws a bit of a fit. An interesting thing to note about Charlotte is, despite how she can act very much like a child when she's excited, she also has the capacity to act like the Southern Belle she is when it's called for. Extra: As a side note, she knows pretty much every fairytale there is.Elegante  DeathRelationships  Canon Dr. Facilier Prince Naveen In-Game Mikaela Sabriel Herz Michelangelo DonatelloThreads  Intro post!

She may be The Ditz, but she doesn't even have to think before sacrificing for her friend. Not only that but, when the kiss doesn't work, she seems genuinely upset and repeatedly tries to make it work. Not to mention that after Tiana's accident at the party, Charlotte immediately leaves Prince Naveen on the dance floor to help Tiana clean up and change her dress. She also offers Tiana a ridiculous amount of money for beignets. This may just be Charlotte having no concept of the value of money, but it gives Tiana enough cash to buy her restaurant.\" I Want my Best Friend to be Happy In a platonic sense! Platonic!!!!!

It doesn\u2019t seem to burn out, but it also doesn\u2019t seem to spread. The smoke stops about ten feet from the fire, but the entire deck smells like a merry campfire. Bags of marshmallows and long sticks are periodically placed at the extreme edge of the fire by one of the crew members, so presumably the conflagration is nothing to be worried about. This deck has an ancient Greek/Roman motif: the walls have been stucco\u2019d, and there are bas relief depictions of life at the time. The door to each room is framed with a Doric column-inspired fa\u00e7ade. Also WHY ARE THERE SO MANY PASSENGERS HERE WHAT THE HELL.Updates Occupants Akagi Shigeru  Akagi is the most badass little kid ever. He drives cars off cliffs and bets his fingers in games and smokes after losing heavy amounts of blood. His eyes stare straight into your soul and his nose could take someone's eye out. (But not really, because it is JUST AN ART STYLE GUYS FFFFF.) Pic is sexy fanart because who really wants to look at razornose.Canon information  Mahjong Legend Akagi ~The Genius who Descended into Darkness~ is all about Akagi and how awesome he is at mahjong and like every other thing that involves gambling ever. He doesn't know how to play mahjong at the beginning of the series, but that doesn't stop him from taking down yakuza rep players the same night he learned and world class players a few days later. Rule of thumb: never bet Akagi something that you aren't 100% willing to lose.Akagi at different ages  The series is set up with three major time skips, showing Akagi at different points in his life. He is introduced at 13, then again at 19-20, and finally appears in one of FKMT's earlier series, Ten, from ages 44-53.At thirteen  Akagi is a sassy little brat who wanders around at night, participates in chicken races with street gangs, and cheats the yakuza. He appears to often stay out all night, which points to lax or overworked parents. Despite being every bit as cunning and calculating as he is later in life, underneath it he is still a kid, albeit a seriously messed up one who gets off by seeing people break down.At 19-20  By this age Akagi is chainsmoking like a nobody's business. He works on an assembly line in a toy factory, and it is implied that he switches jobs often (probably because he's constantly cheating his sempai out of money and beating them up when they protest.) At this age he seems more cynical and resigned to life. His favourite pastime is beating up street punks and yakuza in the middle of the night for no apparent reason.At 44-53  Akagi chills out a LOT, and actually has FRIENDS now. He plays golf with them in Hawaii. He's really rich and makes people bring him a tray of fugu in the middle of the night because he's hungry, eats one piece and then tells them to eat the rest. He also gets Alzheimers and the sight in his eye starts to go, so he decides that life isn't worth living anymore (life is nothing but a game, and if he couldn't play it, there was no point in living,) and euthanizes himself.Differences between anime, manga, and live action versions  Anime Akagi is super cool and unflappable. Manga Akagi actually has the ability to change his expression, and sweats a lot like everyone else in FKMT's comics. Live action Akagi has black hair, and may just be autistic.Fanon  I made up Akagi's height and his family (besides his mom) and his love of baths, guys. Don't hate me.Elegante  Akagi likes to follow Erol around, explore the maze, play video games and take baths.   He's become a smoker a lot earlier on the boat than he did in canon, due to a combination of the irritable/depressed event and the convenient availability of the cigarettes.Relationships  Erol: Akagi thinks Erol is cool.\n Even: Akagi thinks Even is cool, too.\n Jane: Akagi thinks Jane is kinda out of it, but cool.\nEverybody is cool, guys. A more complete list available hereFun Facts!  - Akagi, like all 13 year olds, is a complete shit head. - His favourite food is human souls. But he likes fugu sashi, too. - Being a FKMT character, he expects people to not interrupt his monologues. - He has what is possibly the meanest, squintiest eyes in the history of ever. - \u3056\u308f\uff65\uff65\uff65 \u3056\u308f\uff65\uff65\uff65External Links  True Pariah, an Akagi fansite Akagi article on wikipedia Akagi anime on youtube Akagi manga on onemangaPlaces  Decks & locations relevant to the MS Elegante!", "My Sims Fanon": "My Sims Fanon Characters  You may be looking for: The Animals Category,Character Portals Category, or Character Tabs Category\nThis is a category for characters!

How's it been? -Decca03MySims Agents 2: Morcubus' Revenge Synopsis  You are a new special agent for the SPA. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is this: To capture and detain Morcubus. Before it's too late.Plot  The game begins in Gino's, where Agent Katie, Evelyn and Buddy are sat. They spot a Morcubus blimp and head back to HQ, where Katie is fired apon entry for releasing Morcubus from the nightmare realm. You are then hired. You are given your mission by Walker, and must go and look for Paul Wisnewski. He is misssing. You find a not in his cave, saying \"Morcucorp ha-\". The note has been ripped. You search for the second piece unsuccessfully. You then return to HQ to find Ex-Agent Katie there. She asks to help you, saying that no matter what Walker says, she believes she made the right choice. However she still longs to be an agent and asks to help you in your quest. You agree. Jenny then appears, telling you that Michael Gray has been reported missing. You go to Coney Street to investigate (this is where Mike lives). In his flat, there is a note saying \"-ve a s-\". It fits perfectly to the note you found in Paul's cave. This can't be a coincidence. You have no idea who will disapear next, all you know is they will most likely have worked with Morcubus. Fortunately, Katie has some ideas. Your first stop is Cyrus Boureadeux's mantion. You find everything as it was. except Zombie Carl is acting strangely, saying \"Can't can't can't\". You return to HQ, to find Violet's mother waiting for you. She introduces herself as Iris Nightshade. The name means nothing to you but Katie jumps up and yells \"IRIS! You-I-no!\" She clearly reccognizes the name. \"Iris was the name on the back of the treasure map, and ingraved in that tree! You could be the answer!\" Suddenly, Star appears, and graps Iris. She disapears taking Iris with her. \"No!\" You yell. Iris could have held the missing clue.Animal Crossing Leader Blanky Elius  Blanky Elius, better known as BlankyXP, is the main protagonist of MySims :: Quantum of Rock!.MySims\u00a0:: Quantum of Rock!  Blanky Elius is the main protagonist of MySims :: Quantum of Rock! She lives in the kingdom of Rizaia, in her hometown Elyvorg. She is roommates with Leaf Dremus and Petal Lily Iris.Personality  Often thought of as a bit eccentric, Blanky is a 15,236 years old human girl who appears to be 11-13, like all of the other immortal residents of Rizaia and is the 66,123,489th oldest resident in the kingdom (out of a total of 128,745,259 residents). Blanky often uses slang and has many strange catchphrases, such as the word \"ugly\", which she uses to associate with anything she can, even with things she finds appealing. Many of her close familiars and acquaintances often note or imitate her excessive use of the word \"ugly\" (most notably Leaf and Hopper). When she is not walking with Leaf around the streets of Elyvorg, Blanky is often playing video games or the computer. Blanky also is very familiar and interested in the memes and culture of the internet, and also often makes references to the jokes commonly used on the internet, as well as occasional indirect references to the video games she plays (most often action-adventure, fighting, or puzzle games). She claims that she has played the computer since she was only 8 years old, and video games since she was only 4, indicating that the game takes place in the far future (possibly around the year 17,000). Leaf notes that he sometimes forgets that she is a girl when he talks with her, saying that she often does vulgar actions in the public, such as picking her nose or purposely farting out loud.Baby Blanket/Bowsword  Blanky is emotionally attached to a baby blanket that she has held since she was an infant and still holds now that she calls her \"blanky\", hence her nickname. Her real name is not known and is never mentioned in-game. This blanky that Blanky always has around is not always seen as a blanket. The blanket has a special button inside it that allows it to transform into a weapon that Blanky uses for self-defense, called a bowsword. The bowsword has the functions of both a sword and a bow fused into one, hence the name. The weapon is essentially a bow that can shoot steel arrows, with a sword at the end of the bow's limbs that can be activated with a press of a button. Blanky can press a button to change the bowsword back into a blanket.Abilities Special In-Game Powers  Blanky uses her bowsword to combat foes. The 1st player mainly has to control Blanky throughout the game. The bowsword requires arrows \u2014 like a regular bow would \u2014 in order to be able to shoot targets. Arrows can be found in jars, by defeating enemies, and several other methods. The sword can be used for a close combat with enemies, just like a regular sword. The bowsword can also gain different elemental powers, which can be gained by progressing through the game's plot. These elemental powers often can be used to solve puzzles throughout the game, similar to the Legend of Zelda series.Specials Blanky/Leaf  Once the special is activated, the screen is flooded with white light, with only Blanky and Leaf visible after a few seconds. Blanky throws her bowsword into the air. Leaf plays a rock song on his guitar, sending musical notes, stars, and a colorful beam of light towards the sword. Blanky jumps up and grabs the sword which is glowing with the power of rock, and then plunges the sword down to the ground, sending a loud, powerful force of rock at the enemies. Leaf will add to the power by continuing to play on his guitar. The screen is very colorful and bright, full of musical notes and stars. Enemies will then be defeated by the \"awesomeness\" of the attack. Once the special finishes, Blanky and Leaf do a high-five.Blanky/Garque  Once Blanky and Garque start a special, Blanky tosses her bowsword and gets Garque to toss his baseball bat into the air. Both of them then fly into the air and Blanky accidentally grabs the baseball bat while Garque grabs the bowsword. As this happens, Garque shouts, \"OMG!\" and Blanky shouts \"NOOO! I GOT TEH NOOBY WEAPON!\" Once they land, Garque is nauseous, being so near to such a sharp weapon. Blanky, in panic, whacks Garque with the baseball bat on accident. Garque flies around the vicinity, knocking out enemies. Once all the enemies in the area are eliminated, Garque lands on the floor, dizzy.Blanky/Petal  Petal calls the powers of the Elven Gods with her magic to enchant Blanky's sword temporarily with powerful magic. Blanky is then restored to full health, temporarily invincible, is 5 times faster, is more powerful, and can do a special attack where she can zip through enemies and defeat them. Petal is also temporarily given invincible powers and can do far more powerful magic, such as creating tidal waves with water magic and summoning a phoenix.MySims Galaxy  (MySims Galaxy is the first game created by Potterfan1997) MySims Galaxy is a new video game in the MySims Series.

It's nice to see that the wikia is reviving again after all this time. As for me, I've been really busy because of work, starting a new youtube channel, working on a script for a game I hope to produce someday, and a comic book that I've been trying to get off the ground for about 3 years. But, it's all okay, I'm here to stay and hopefully nothing gets in the way again.\u00a0Afro samarai (talk) 01:36, April 10, 2014 (UTC) Sad to say, that Afros and Swords in no longer going to be a comic series but rather short stories. This is another comic called SOB Squad, which I haven't released anything just yet because I'm still trying to figure out how to introduce the lore of their world to the readers without having it come on too strong or leaving them confused with the lack of details.\u00a0Afro samarai (talk) 11:39, April 10, 2014 (UTC) The last remake of the Afros and Swords series can be found here:\u00a0http://afrosamarai.deviantart.com/art/Afros-and-Swords-Saga-1-Ch-1-P-1-294294641 And the latest remake of SOB squad can be found here:\u00a0http://sobsquad.thecomicseries.com/archive Note that the SOB squad there is nothing like the SOB squad I have planned for the future.

I was nice on your wiki! You're the ones to anger me on that wiki because of the conterversial causes on your games. Someone put Dora in a fighting game while another person made a Pok\u00e9mon into the worst possible type! And plus, what if someone made a Pok\u00e9mon into a 100-type? What if someone added Alex Russo into a Super Smash Bros. fangame? No one likes Dora, the Fire/Fighting-type, a freaking 100-type or Alex Russo AT ALL! They all have conterversities!

You've decided on retiring from the business as a young, successful detective. The game begins with a death, and the last case you handled. You had been chasing Morcubus's ally, named Dankato, and he's armed with a gun. He's been wanted for trying to regain the Nightmare Crown, and had already had fortunite. He had been running through the city, chased by you and your team. He ran by a schoolyard and took one of the kids hostage. The kid's name was Poppy, and she was 5 years old. Poppy: Sir, I don't know you. Dankato: Quiet you! You: Surrender! You're cornered! Dankato: Don't come closer! If you do, I'll shoot this girl. Dankato grabbed Poppy. Buddy didn't know what to do. The girl cried. Her sister came up running. Violet: Poppy! Dankato: Don't come closer! If you do, I'll shoot! Violet had put her hands up in the air. Dankato forced you to put down your gun, and threatened to shoot if you did otherwise. You had a choice to request a last meal, or quickly grab your gun and shoot for your life. You had requested one last meal, and Dankato allowed it. He knew that once he let Poppy go, you'd be shot. You took a sandwich out of your bag, and Dankato had fallen to his knees in pain. Dankato: What-What is this!? You: If my memory serves, it says in your file, you're allergic to peanuts. Dankato: N-Noooo! You: Let the girl go! Poppy: *Whimpers* Dankato: Never! You: The Sandwich goes away if you let her go! Poppy: *Screams* Dankato: N-Never! You had to choose whether to put the sandwich away or keep it out. You chose to keep it out, until he let go of Poppy and surrendered his gun. You: Last Chance. Dankato: N-N-Never! Within 5 seconds of this being said, Dankato fainted. You had a choice whether to talk to Poppy or call an ambulance. You chose to talk to Poppy. You: Are you okay? Violet: Poppy! Poppy: Mister, what happened to that man? You: He's gone. For good. Violet: Really? Forever? You: His peanut allergy is airborne, and lethal. You glanced at his corpse. You knew that you were a murderer. You had a choice to leave or file a 911 report. You filed a 911 report. After filing the report, you went back to your headquarters. You met Walker, another Special Agent. Walker: You did what you had to do. You: Yeah....I quit. Walker: What? You: I quit. I can't keep doing this. My first case left Morcubus and Evelyn stranded. Now someone died at my hand. Your partner, Buddy, walked in. Buddy: Technically, he died at your lunch. You: Yeah, but that doesn't matter. I quit. You packed your bags and left the HQ, leaving Buddy in charge. Buddy wasn't the best leader, but he tried. Five years later, your city had been overrun by crime. You lived in a rather large house, and had received a phone call.Chapter 2: Becoming an Agent, Again  You had been living in your house, not doing much. Your life became very boring, routine, etc. At 6:30 AM, while you were in bed, you received a phone call. You had a choice to either fall back asleep or answer the phone. You decided to answer the phone. Buddy: Hey! It's been a while, hasn't it? You: Buddy? Is that you? Buddy: Yup, it's me! Anyways, I wish I didn't have to call. You: What do you mean? A call from you is always a call answered! Buddy: No, it's the reason I called. I need your help on a mission. You: No. Buddy: But, it's high priority! You: No. Buddy: But! You: My decision is final. You had a choice to hang up the phone angrily, or say goodbye. You chose to say goodbye before hanging up. You: Look, I gotta go. Bye Buddy: It's the Nightmare Crown. Once you heard that, you were curious. You had a choice to listen more, or hang up. You chose to hang up. You: Bye. Buddy: Wa-! You'd hung up before he could finish. You continued the day like you normally did, until you got a knock on the door. You had a choice to answer or ignore him. You ignored him, but he started pounding harder. You decided to answer after you thought the door was going to fall of its hinges. ???: Hey, I'm Danny. You: What do you want? Danny: I'm here to offer..\"insurance\". You: Insurance? Danny: Just to make sure nothing unfortunate will happen to your house. Or your car. You: Get out of here! Danny: Or what, you'll call the cops? I stopped them up good already. You: Or I'll grab my gun and shoot, I was a special agent. Danny had just sighed. You had a choice to grab your gun, or slam the door. You decided to slam the door. You continued the day like normal, and decided to go out for lunch. You could've chose Simburger or Sal's Sim Salad. You chose to go to Simburger. After waiting twenty minutes for your burger, you drove back home to a destroyed house. Everything was destroyed. You decided to call 911. Ironically, Buddy came on the scene. Buddy: Ah, I see. So some kid wrecked your house? You: Yes. He said his name was Danny. He wore a Red Jacket and a golden mask. Guessing he wanted to protect his identity. Buddy: Well, there's nothing I can do. You: WHAT!? Buddy: I've got too many cases, nothing in my power! You: WHAT!? Buddy: I legally can't take it. You were puzzled. You didn't know what to do. You could've yelled at Buddy, or offered help. You offered help. You: If I take one of your easier cases, will you handle my house? Buddy: Hmm...for you...anything! You had become an agent. You returned to the HQ, to find some old agents and some New ones. Walker introduced you. Walker: You're back? You: Only so Buddy can handle my case. Walker: Alright, let me get you up to speed first. We've got 5 teams, all led by a special agent. Buddy has one, I have one, and a few others too. But you're going to lead a team too. You: Remember, it's only temporary. Walker: Yeah, I know. Anyways, here's your team. You and Walker went to the third floor. You saw something that shocked you. Walker: Here's Travis, there's PiX, and here's Danny. You: DANNY!? HE WRECKED MY HOUSE! Danny: What are you talking about? You: I'LL GET YOU! Walker: Calm down, Calm down. Your house was raided around 12:30, correct? Buddy told me. Anyways, Danny was here since 10:30. You: Wait, you're... Danny: What are you talking about? PiX: ...This is the new leader? They couldn't do better? Travis: Dunno...I guess not. You: ...who're you? Some kind of ninja? PiX: I've trained with the top ninja of the world. I'm top class, ranking with Star. You: .....What? Walker: Alright. I'll give you guys an hour or so to get to know each other. I'll assign your mission after that. You had a choice. You could go to the Mall and get coffee to bond or finding out more about them. You chose to find out more about them You: So, how did you guys become agents? Travis: A friend of mine became a special agent too, so I made it my goal to become one too. But you walk in here and take the lead. Like the iTouch replacing the Shuffle. You: ...Anyways, how'd you become an agent PiX? PiX: I was already an agent, just for Japan. Japanese Agents are simply ninjas, even though I'm not Japanese. I transfered because Star wound up taking all the cases. You:...All of them? PiX: Yup, all of them. You: And you, Danny. He had laughed. Danny: Walker took me off the streets. I had been the most fierce street thug, even had to keep my identity secret. He had revealed part of his face, and he looked familiar. You: Have we met somewhere before? Danny: No. You had been bothered with the situation. You just had a thought about where you knew him from, but Walker came in. Walker: Alright, you guys are doing a robbery mission. Sir Vincent Skullfinder's Museum was robbed of its top exhibit. Go check out the scene. You had a mission. You were also curious. Where do I know Danny from? Who wrecked my house? Then, a phone rang. It was yours. You answered your phone. A Family member had answered. ???: Hey, cousin! You: Luis? That you? Luis: Yeah! Anyways, I've got terrible news... His voice sounded dire. You continued to talk. Luis: Auntie Shirley...she's missing! You: What!? Luis: Yeah. The police already came. Took her stuff and everything, it's evidence. You: I-I understand. Now I've just got to talk to Walker! Luis: What..? You: Nevermind. Bye. You hung up. You walked down and found Walker. You asked about Shirley's Absence. Walker: I just didn't have the heart to tell you. So I didn't give you that mission either. But don't worry, we'll handle it. Buddy had walked in. Buddy: Hey, I heard about Shirley being kidnapped. You: SHE WAS WHAT!? Buddy:....Nevermind! Buddy left the scene. Walker: I'm sorry. They're demanding a ransom. Until then.. You: WHO ARE THEY!?!? Walker had tried to leave, but you ran in front of him, stopping him. Walker: ...Dankato. Dankato. The same Dankato that had you become a murderer. The same Dankato that died. Or at least, you thought. Walker explained that his peanut allergy causes comas, not death. This lead to the assumption that he was only unconcious then, and that you're not a killer. So now, many questions arise. Is this Dankato's Revenge? What will happen with the Museum Case? How can I get Aunt Shirley back?Chapter 3: The Curator's Case  So you'd just found out about your kidnapped aunt. But you were told to stay off the mission. You kept arguing with Walker, and you two finally reached a compromise. You could help with that case once you were done with yours. So now, you had the freedom to go to Town and find the Museum. But something new was thrown into play. Walker: Alright, you guys will be on your mission shortly. Just have to wait for your new member... You: New Member? Danny: It's Anthony. Travis: He's my overrated cousin. You: ...Overrated? Travis: Yeah, he's supposedly popular. I don't see it. You: Popular? As in...Charasmatic? Travis: Yeah, I guess. You had thought. You knew that charisma could come in handy later in the missions. Then, he walked in Anthony: Hey, it's my geeky cousin! Travis: Hello Ant. PiX: So, this is him? Could be more...professional. Anthony: So this is the agent gig? Danny: I don't like him. Travis: Ehh, he's annoying, but a nice guy overall I suppose. You: Welcome to the team! Walker: Now, is that everyone? I suppose it is. Anthony, I hope you know that the race for the position was tight. A girl named Poppy was also applying for that position. You had recongnized the name, but ignored it. She didn't bring back positive memories. You: So, we're going on a mission now? Anthony: Yeah, I guess. So your team went on the mission. It was a Museum run by Professor Luna and curated by Sir Vincent Skullfinder. You and your team walked around a bit and examined the missing exhibit. After analyzing the crime scene, you found a trail of footprints. After following it, you came to a broken security camera. Professor Luna: Any leads? You: Well, yes, and no. We got the camera, but it's kinda busted. Travis: That won't be a problem. Anthony: Travis should be able to fix it. You: Really? PiX: No he won't. There's no way that could be fixed. Travis: I won't fix it, but I'll transfer the data from it to a computer. I just need a Flash Drive. After searching around, you found Flash Drives in Vincent's office. You asked if you could use them, and you were coldly rejected. Danny: Hmm... Danny had his hand on his pistol. PiX came over and calmed him down. PiX: The ninja excel in secrecy. I'll get the Flash Drives. You played a mini-game as PiX, and were able to steal the Flash Drives. Travis: Alright, now I just insert it here..there we go! Travis had the flash drives. You took them back to the HQ and uploaded the video file to the computer. The video showed Vincent stealing the exhibit-THE NIGHTMARE CROWN. It had been exhibited there. There were files on the Flash Drive as well. They read \"I've done as you said, captured her and everything. Your delivery should arrive shortly. That looked suspicious, and made you realize that Vincent kidnapped your aunt. You went down to the Museum and explained everything, and found a pistol pointed at your head. Vincent: You know too much. A group of KILL Staff surrounded you. This was a dire situation. Danny: You got us...pretty good too. Travis: Huh? Danny: Execute Manuver 7! Suddenly, PiX pulled out a nunchuck and started swinging in a circle. Danny had started firing stray bullets into the air, and the KILL members backed up. Vincent: We have nothing to gain by being here. Derek: I guess you're right. The KILL members were able to leave. But they fired one last bullet at you. Then, a bang was heard. It came from Danny's gun. He had shot the bullet, and the two went astray. You: Danny, you saved me? Danny: Don't remind me. Danny put his gun away. Anthony was stunned at what had happened. Travis had been calling Walker to report what had happened. PiX came back, and brought their attention to Professor Luna. PiX: Don't worry mam, we'll get that exhibit back. Granted, it will most likely be relocated. This isn't the safest place after all. Professor Luna: I understand. So now, you finished your mission. Which ironically, lead to the case you wanted. Soon you'll be rescuing your aunt. Don't fail.Chapter 4: Save My Soul  You knew your next case was to look into Aunt Shirley's Kidnapping. It was late, so you went back and rented an apartment. The Manager had told you to keep out of room 647. After looking around the hotel, you saw footprints from your room. They lead into Room 647. You walked in, and there was a flash. You had seen Dankato in the room. He pointed a gun at you, and you were helpless. The door had shut and locked from the other side, there was no escape. Dankato: Well well, if it isn't you again. You: I'm curious, how'd you survive? Dankato: Put Simply, KILL Technology. I switched souls with my second son at my moment of death, then re-took my corpse thereafter. You: So, you killed your son? Dankato: The disappointment, yes. I let Danny live. You: Danny...THAT'S WHERE I KNOW HIM FROM! Dankato: Yes, not that it matters. You grabbed a gun from your pocket, quickly, you both fired. Both shots were fatal, killing both of you. Everything you worked for. Over. But your eyes were open in the moment of death, and so were your ears. You heard a shot outside the door, and your aunt's scream. Then it went black. Until, you saw someone. He had black hair and red eyes. ???: He's forsaken me too. You: So you're Kato, huh? Kato: Yes. I was born different, so I was killed. I'm the man who wants you dead. You: What? We're already dead..aren't we? Kato: I'm contacting you through KILL Technology. Dankato lied to you in your moment of death. But suddenly, he disappeared. And a new vision came. Only this wasn't a vision. You had seen a hospital. Danny: He's coming to. Buddy: What were you doing at the Hotel? You got shot! You:...What? Suddenly, Walker came in. He spoke to you alone. Walker: The Enhanced Genyll was found in the room with you. You: What? Walker: It's a machine made by KILL. It renders the victim unaware of what happens around them, and the enhanced version allows them to control your senses. Everything was fake. You: It-It Can't be possible! So it was all an illusion? Walker: They may've told you some correct information... You: What? Walker: Sit down..there's something I have to tell you. Dankato's dead. Always was. I told you that so you'd be interested in the missions, because your arch rival is still out there. You: Anything Else. Walker sighed. Walker: The true Villan, the one that caused the kidnapping of your aunt..that's Kato. He wants to avenge Dankato and get revenge on you. You: Why? I never even met the guy... Walker: Kato is Dankato's son, and so is Danny. I rescued Danny from a terrible place, but Kato was forced to live there his whole life. I even had to send an ambulance over cause he got shot. He had no money, all because his father is dead. You: So..I did that..to him.. Walker: Dankato deserved to die.. You: There's one thing though...why'd they use the Genyll? And did you actually see them when you found me? Walker: Isn't it obvious? You were shot. And no, I didn't see them when I came. It was just an empty room. You: And that Manager... Walker: It was a KILL Member in disguise. We actually have him in custody. A few shots were heard in a room nearby. But it wasn't a hospital room. It was to be used to interrogate the KILL Member, Derek. You ran in to find Danny, shot. And, you found Anthony, dead. You: Danny! Anthony! Danny had been hospitalized, and was still unconcious. Anthony was clearly dead, and was taken to a morgue. Derek was gone. Walker: There's no real point in you staying here any longer. We've checked your apartment complex for any KILL Agents, it's safe. I'll give you a report on Danny in the AM. You went to your hotel and fell asleep. Only, you were awoken by a person. Sort of... Anthony: ..Boss? You there? You: What the!? You're dead! Anthony: I know. But my soul remains here. I promised to be a part of the team, and the universe won't let my soul free. You: You want to die? Anthony: In this state, I'm already dead. No one can notice me unless I met them while I was alive. That's why I ask you to save my soul. You: Maybe the universe wants you to finish your job... Anthony: I'll do it! I can manipulate small objects, think that would be useful? You: Yeah, it probably would be. Anthony: Can you do me one more favor though? You: What is it? Anthony: Explain all this to Travis please..I-I can't bring myself to do that. I was a fool. An unarmed agent is like a sitting duck. You: Ah. Anthony: And..apologize to Danny for me too please.. You: What? Anthony: Danny tried to save me by shooting Derek...but he got shot in the process. Now he may be joining me soon.. Back at KILL Headquarters.... Kato: You shot him with the G(-)057 Bullets?! What's wrong with you!? Derek: Please...forgive me... Kato: I'm afraid I won't be showing mercy on a mission this important. Derek was shot by Kato. You had fallen back to sleep, and sure enough, Anthony was waiting for you. You headed straight to the HQ to break the news to Travis. You explained what had happened, and Anthony's Ghost appeared. Travis: So...you're dead? Anthony: Yes. Only people who I knew before death are those whom I can talk with. Travis: I-I just can't believe it. You had continued talking with Travis. Suddenly, Walker came by. Only one thing. He had red eyes and was ghastly pale. You: Walker? You alright there? Anthony: He doesn't look it. Suddenly, PiX entered through the door. PiX: We have to go, now! You: What? PiX: They're using the Genyll again! They're gonna blow up the HQ! PiX then shot everyone. Only the bullets cured the Genyll, and disappeared along with the Illusion. PiX: There's no time, we've gotta- Suddenly, the HQ blew up. It was completely wrecked, and arriving from a helicopter was Kato. Kato: Well..look who's here. He grabbed his gun. You were already immobile, having a large piece of rock fallen on top of you. Kato: Goodbye. But then, something weird happened. The gun itself exploded. Kato: Hmm..this piece of rubbish. Esma, toss me your gun. Esma: Yes your master. Esma handed Kato the gun, and he shot again. And again, it exploded. Kato: Alright, enough with the funny games. I'm talking to you, Anthony. You had no clue what was happening. Until you heard a voice. Anthony: I'm helping. It appears I've been given some abilities in this \"Ghost\" state. Kato: Look, I can bring you back to life. Just reposses the TV, and I'll be able to communicate. You had switched to play as Anthony, and walked into the TV. Then, the screen played \"How do you know me?\" Kato: Look, Derek was my agent. He shot you. With some \"Ghost\" Bullets. They gave you afterlife and ghost abilities. Derek explained everything. Now, this can benefit both of us. I can bring you back to life. In return, the ghost abilities cannot be used against me. Because you'll lose them. Anthony: Anything that helps you, I won't do. Kato: Well, I'll just capture your little friend here. Kato had went to kidnap you. There was nothing Anthony could do. But you weren't frightened. This was your chance to save Shirley. Kato had taken you into a jet, and took off.Chapter 5: KILL's Goals  You and Kato had been talking. You: Why are you so avengeful? Kato had turned around, and you continued. You: Danny wasn't like this. Nor will he ever be. Kato: He still hates you. But he got the better end of the deal, he didn't endure the suffering I did. And if it weren't for Walker, he'd kill you. Kato looked out the window. He then looked back at you. Kato: We're here. You peered out the window, tied up. You had seen the ocean. Kato had opened the window and thrown you out. Kato: SO LONG FILTHY SCUM! And so you fell, and fell, and fell. Then everything went black. You awoke to a new world, or, to you at least. ???: You think she's/he's alive? ??: I dunno..SHE/HE looks dead. We'll need to head over to Isaac and Shepard's district, they've got all the examiners there. We should be there in a few minutes. Then, you heard a few shots. ???: We're being fire on! We're being fired on! ??: I'm gonna get Captain Morrigan. Grab a gun and fire out from the window, our plane's guns are down! He left, and the first person started firing using a gun. Then, you heard a familiar voice. Anthony: [NAME]! [NAME]! Are you there!? You: Anthony? ???: Who're you talking to? Anthony: Yeah, I followed you throw the plane, and I also threw this plan off course and opened the top to catch you. You: So..you saved me? ???: What? Yeah..I..guess..? Anthony: Yeah, but Kato noticed. He's probably the one firing on the plane. Also..the plane's gun is down cause the top kinda crushed it... You: Wait, why don't you try repossessing the plane then. ???: What? You're dilussional. You probably got some brain damage from the fall. You: Alright, go Anthony. ???: Who's Anthony? Anthony went to disable the other plane's gun. You and the first person kept talking. You: Sorry, I probably confused you. But everything's fine. The other plane should be disabled any second now...don't ask. ???: Okay..Anyways, I'm Elliot. You: Hi Elliot..where am I? Elliot: You're on a War-Plane. We protect our Country's border. But this plane isn't a country's, which is weird. You: His name is Kato, CEO of KILL. Elliot: ..Kato? As in..DanKato? You: Yes. I'm the person who killed Dankato. And now Kato wants to avenge his father by killing me. Elliot: Dankato was my partner..until he went rogue. Then he met some Morcubus character. You: Yes. Morcubus died, and Dankato wanted to fulfill Morcubus's Dying Wish, capturing the Nightmare Crown. Which is where Kato will go next if he kills me. Then the entire world will be doomed. Elliot: I didn't think Dankato would get into trouble like that. It's almost depressing. Anthony came back. Anthony: Okay, the plane is about to explode. You: Good, maybe this will finally end Kato. Anthony: You want him dead? You: No, it would be befitting if he fell to the same enemy his father did, proving he's about as strong as him. Elliot: There you go again! You: Sorry. But again, it's Kato. He shot my friend, and somehow, my friend is a ghost now. Elliot: You sure you don't have brain damage? You: Anthony, go on that screen right there. Anthony: Okay. The screen then displayed \"Hello, I'm Anthony. I know, this may be hard for you to take in at once.\" Suddenly, the second person came in as well as the supposed Captain Morrigan. ??: He's awake! Elliot: Yeah. By the way, that's Rios, and that's Morrigan. Morrigan: Captain Morrigan to you. You: Okay...anyways, the other plane is going. The other plane exploded, and you saw a corpse fall into the water. But was it Kato? You: Hey Anthony, go check and see who it is. The screen displayed \"Alright, be back in a second.\" Morrigan: What's going on? You: Look, I need to get back to my HQ. I'm an agent from New SimCity. Rios: New SimCity, eh? That's sorta far from here, and you might need a medical examination.. Elliot: We're in his debt, he just downed the other plane. Morrigan: Alright, the agent can go back. I'll go turn the plane's direction. Morrigan left, and Anthony came back. You: Anthony, any news? Anthony: Well..it wasn't Kato. It was a person named \"Yuki\", according to her convenient name tag. You: Alright. Anyways, we're headed back to New SimCity. Anthony: Good. Rios: Uhh..who is he talking to..? Elliot: You get used to it. Within a day, you arrived back to your city. Relieved to see nothing had changed. You had to find a telephone and make a call.Chapter 6: Mission Success..Or Failure?  You had gotten back to New SimCity. You made a call to Travis, finding that there is no HQ. They've been meeting in the Park the past day. You walked from Main Street to the park, and found Travis, Danny, PiX and Walker, upset for some reason. Anthony: Why are they so upset? You: I dunno. Hey Travis! Travis: I'm still surprised you lived. We even called the funeral home. Speaking of that, we should get to the Funeral Home. You: What? PiX: We had a mission to rescue your aunt... You: Sh-She died?! Walker: No. The Mission was led by Buddy. Your aunt was found by Buddy in a KILL warehouse. She was tied up, and it took time for him to untie her. By the time she was untied, Buddy was at gunpoint. Shirley and Buddy ran away, and hid behind some crates. Shirley ran, and Buddy said He'd finish off the KILL Member. You: ..What? He was always a bit cowardly.. Walker: He stepped up since you left the Agency. He became brave. But he didn't become smarter. The Guy took out a liter and threw it at Buddy. He easily dodged it. You: I don't see the problem... PiX: He hid behind Crates of Gunpowder. You were in shock. Buddy made such an idiotic move, and died for it. You: So...he's dead? Travis: Yeah. Danny: The KILL Member was killed in the blast too. You had remembered Danny was hurt. You: Danny!? You're alright? Danny: Yeah. You: But..you got shot! You're lucky to be standing! Danny: Yeah, I just deal with the pain. Walker: Danny's tough. He's had his whole life rough, he can deal with it. Danny: It's not the first time I got shot anyways. PiX: We should head to Buddy's Funeral.. You: This quickly? He just died.. Travis: Buddy left his will, saying that he wanted a quick funeral. We owe him that much. You: I suppose you're right.. You began to cry. Suddenly, the limo pulled up. Walker: Alright, let me know how it is. [YOUR NAME] and I need to talk. PiX: Alright. PiX, Travis and Danny left. It was just you, Walker and Anthony. You: Why do we need to talk? Walker: To set up a mission to end kill. And so you did. You plotted and plotted. Until you find yourself twined in a plot.Chapter 7: Danny 2.0  You and Walker had begun thinking about intercepting a delivery to KILL. The limo didn't leave yet, which was suspicious. But then Danny walked in. Danny: Travis and PiX have gone to KILL! They're betraying us! You: What? Walker: What's the meaning of this? Danny: He put a gun up to my head. I ran. You: What the Hell? Walker: Hmm... You: I'll grab a gun, are they outside? Danny: Probably. Danny grabbed you a gun and gave it to you. You walked outside, and asked them why they were betraying you. You: So Danny tells me you're a traitor. PiX: What? That doesn't make any sense... Travis: Yeah, Danny's- You interrupted. You: I don't wanna hear it. Suddenly, you heard gunshots from the makeshift HQ. You ran in to see what happened, and found Walker on the ground, suffering from a bullet wound. And Danny, holding the gun. He pointed it at you. You: What the..? Danny: Goodbye [NAME]. You were always terrible. You had tried to shoot. And then saw that your gun was empty. Travis: This doesn't make any sense.. Danny: Shut up! PiX's eyes were dead red. Which was odd. PiX: It's Not... Suddenly, a shot was heard. Each second passed by as an hour. You wondered what would happen. But the shot was fired back at Danny, but missed. Anthony: It's a robot! Travis: Danny rode his skateboard there. Limos were too flashy. Danny: SHUT UP! PiX: He's right.. Danny: SHUT UP!! Anthony got a gun and was ready to fire. Danny: I wouldn't do that if I were you! You: And why would that be? Danny: I'm a bomb. If I get shot, kaboom. You all die, and I'll be replaced. It's my ultimate destiny. You: And what's preventing us from just leaving? Danny: I don't think you'd want to leave Walker by himself..he could die easily. And I could shoot him some more. Your choice. You thought there was no way to win. You'd been beaten. Danny: Now, show me to the fortunite and I don't kill you. You: Never. PiX: You want the fortunite? I'll lead you to it. Danny: Very well. You: No! PiX: We've been bested. Follow me. Danny and PiX walked inside. He found the fortunite. PiX: Here you go. Now get out. Danny grabbed the shotgun. Danny: I'm afraid you're about to die. PiX: Don't think so. Now that we're at a far enough distance.. Danny: What? PiX stabbed Danny with Kunai. His wiring was visible, and revealed some differences from the real Danny. Danny: You fool, you'll die now too! PiX: Substitution Jutsu! Danny: What the- Suddenly, the Danny Bot Exploded. You: PiX, where'd you learn that? PiX: I'm a ninja, I posses the Sharingan too. That's how I knew he was a bot. The Substitution Jutsu can't be used too often, it weakens me. But I knew I had to do that. Travis: WHAT JUST HAPPENED!? PiX: One of KILL's Plots. Danny's probably just at the Funeral. And that was a good plan too. Walker: Well-Well done. You: You alright? Walker: Yeah, he missed me. It was my blood sugar that put me down. PiX; Diabetes? Walker: Yeah...give me some sugar...please. Travis pulled a lollipop out of his pocket and threw it at Walker. Walker started eating it. You: Walker, you need an ambulance? Walker: I'll be fine kid. Just head over to Buddy's funeral. Suddenly, Danny ran in. Danny: The corpse was stolen! You: What?! Travis: KILL's plotted this. PiX: You're right. Tonight, I fear there will be one less person among our team. Danny: ...What? PiX: KILL sent a robot over here. They designed in like you, so it'd trick us. I defeated him, but the HQ's top floor got damaged. Danny: Everyone's alright? You: Yeah, we're all fine. Walker: Tonight..it's the perfect opportunity. You: You're back up on your feet? Walker: Yeah. And I have a plan. We divide into two teams. One lead by me, one lead by [NAME]. PiX: They're aren't enough people. Walker: Which is why I'm calling in some international agents. You: Allow me to do the honors. You called Elliot. You saw a phone number on the plane. Elliot: Hey, it's you again! You: How'd you know... Elliot: Caller ID, saw your name. You: Oh, right. Anyways, how fast can your team get to New SimCity, the park to be exact. Elliot: We're patrolling it right now. You: Alright, get here as fast as possible. Within five minutes, Elliot arrived. Walker: Agent Morrigan? Morrigan: Well, if it isn't Walker. It's been a while, hasn't it? You: You two know each other? Walker: We apprenticed the same Special Agent. Morrigan was given a role in the war, only top agents go there. Should they desire to. Elliot: I was recruited, along with Rios. Walker: Alright, so here's the plan....Chapter 8: The Mission Begins  You had gone off with your team. Walker lead Morrigan, Elliot and Rios. On this mission, you will control Walker and his team as well as yours. You were tracking Buddy's DNA to KILL HQ. Your team followed behind. Walker: Alright, it looks like we're here. Ready? Elliot: We're just the bait, right? Walker: Yeah. Alright, Morrigan, get the wheel. Elliot and Rios, Man the Machine Guns. Rios: Alright. Walker's team started to fire at KILL Headquarters. Meanwhile... Kato had received a transmission from one of the guards. Kato: What is it? Guard: They're firing at us! They've got machine guns! Kato: What!? Fire at all costs! Go get the rockets. We just got a shipment from the warehouse. Guard: Yes Sir! On the ground... You: Alright, ready guys? Walker's gonna have the plane shoot some of the guards. The guards back here will run over there, making our part easier. This way we don't have to fight more guards. Danny: Where's PiX? Anthony: I can't detect his presence... You: Uhh... Travis: We're into the mission already, there's not too much we can do. Danny: But how'd he just disappear? Anthony: I don't detect him anywhere here.. Danny: So he's a coward then. Figures. You: No time for that, just remain hidden. Back on the Plane... Rios: Uhh, boss, we're taking hits. Big ones too. Walker: What? Morrigan: Uh-oh, I gotta flip the plane. A Rocket is headed straight for us. There was an explosion. Morrigan: We're going down! Grab the Parachutes and Jump! Rios: If we jump, they'll just shoot, and we're doomed! Elliot: Just grab a gun and jump! Meanwhile... Guard: Their plane is about to crash, what should we do? Kato: They'll probably jump, just shoot them. It's the best oppurtunity. Need any more guards? Guard: That would be nice... Kato: Very well. Now, get off the transmissions. Guard: Yes sir! Kato: Guards, go away, I can take care of myself. Guards: Yes sir! On the ground... Head Guard: We've all been ordered to go at the front. Guards: Yes sir! You: Now's our chance, go! Your team went into the building. Back at Walker's Team... Walker: You heard her, grab a gun, a parachute, and jump! Now! Walker, Rios and Elliot jumped. They all had guns, but started to wonder about Morrigan. Rios: Where's Morrigan!? Walker: I'm not sure... Elliot: We've got bigger problems! Guards: There they are! Shoot them! Walker: Just shoot! Suddenly, the plane crashed into KILL Headquarters. Rios: MORRIGAN!! Elliot: Pay attention, you're gonna get shot! Suddenly, they began aiming for the parachutes. Walker: Crap! I gotta hole in my parachute! After that, several more bullets shot down Walker. Rios: WALKER! Then, they started to hit Elliot. Elliot: I'm going down! Rios: NO! Elliot fell, being surrounded by guards. Rios: NO! Rios started shooting crazily. Rios: They won't die! They can't! Suddenly, he heard a shout from the ground. Walker: RIOS! CARRY OUT THE MISSION! Rios: No! On the Ground... Guards: We'll just tie them up and shoot them. I guess that'll work. The guard became pale, and his eyes bulged out. More guards started witnessing this symptoms. Until, all of the guards did. They all fell down, revealing knives stuck in their back. Walker: What just happened? PiX: Mission Success. Come on out Kage & Star. Kage: Hmph. Star: Good, at least we were able to save them. Elliot: What's going on? PiX: I've had a lot of experience with fishing, my friend. Elliot: What? PiX: It doesn't work out too well for the bait. You guys were the bait. I strayed from [NAME]'s team. I knew this would be my mission. And I called Star too. Rios fell from the sky safely. Rios: Who are those guys? Walker: One of them is one of [NAME]'s agents. They saved us. You would've died too. Rios: ....so...what now? Elliot: We carry out the mission. Recover Buddy's corpse and Back up [NAME]'s team.Chapter 9: Kato Gets Killed..?  So, Walker's team along with PiX's friends went into the compound. Your team had already entered. Travis: So, where are we gonna find Kato. You: He's probably hiding in a bunker in the ground. We'll probably have to blow this place up to find it. Danny: We're not gonna damage anything here. The technology could be used to better simkind, should it be used for good purposes. You: I suppose so, but I make no promises. Danny: Considering you have no explosives, I'll agree to that. You: Fine... Danny had acted suspiciously. You were keeping an eye on him. Back at Walker's Team... Walker: We should be nearing the corpse. But we have to find Kato first. Rios: Why? PiX: We spent too much time rescuing you. Elliot: He can get away you know. Rios: Alright..but what about Morrigan? Walker had stopped. Walker: MORRIGAN! WE HAVE TO FIND HER! Walker had went to the Crash Site. Your team heard and approached. Travis: Why're we headed here? Anthony: To regroup, take a head count. You: Exactly. Danny: I see them. Both teams met in a bright room. Its walls were completely metal. There, you saw Morrigan, with her gun pointed at Kato. Morrigan: I have him. Walker: Job well done. Now shoot! Morrigan: We may be able to get some questioning out of him. Then, there was a shot. And Danny held the gun. And Morrigan, was the one trembling. Travis: WHAT THE HELL!? Danny: She has a KILL Emblem on her jacket. She was gonna betray us. Walker: YOU CAN'T JUST ASSUME THAT! SHE COULD BE DEAD NOW! Kato had clapped. Kato: But he was right. Hello once more, my best enemies. Tonight will be your last night. You: What makes you say that? Kato: Simply because I can destroy the compound within seconds. Your entire team would die. You were distraught. Kato: Make a decision. If you turn yourself into my custody, I'll let your team go. You can have the Former Bellhop's corpse, I have no reason to keep it. You: ...Fine. PiX: Not without the Genyll. Kato: I don't know what you're talking about. PiX: Give us the genyll. Kato: No. Never. Star had grabbed her kunai (throwing knives). Kato: One more thing. Rios: What would that be? Kato: The second I saw you come here, I sent my guards to your HQ as well. They're recovering the Fortunite. Time to leave, wouldn't you agree? PiX: I'll go to the HQ. Kato: You've got no method of leaving. The exits are all locked. PiX ran. Elliot followed. Kato: They won't get far. Now, what's your decision. You: I'll stay with you, as long as you don't kill me. Kato: Don't you know a thing about animals? They like to torture their prey before they kill it. As for the rest of you, you'll remain prisoner here. Until the Genyll is secured, got it? Now, allow me to confiscate all weapons. Kato took all the weapons and locked your team in an empty room. Meanwhile... PiX was using a Communication jutsu to call a friend. PiX: How fast can you bomb KILL HQ? And make it so no one gets hurt. ???: I can try my weakest bomb, but I make no promises. It's a chemical bomb, it'll take a while to get to you. PiX: Good. Admist the chaos I'll be able to rescue them. Back with You and Kato... Kato: So tell me, how does it feel to have left a child away from home? You: Terrible. It was my only option. I wish I could've done something else. Kato: YOU LIAR! Kato grabbed a knife. He held it close to your neck. Kato: You enjoyed killing him, you cold hearted murderer! You: I'm the murderer?! I KILLED A CRIMINAL! YOU KILLED ONE OF MY AGENTS, WHO'S RIGHT HERE NOW! Kato: Oh, I'm not too worried about it. You want your friend back, Fine. COME OUT COME OUT WHERE EVER YOU ARE! Anthony had whispered to you. Anthony: This guy is nearing insanity. You: I know. Kato: WHERE ARE YOU!? I'LL GET YOU BACK TO HUMAN! SHOW YOURSELF! I'VE GOT THE GENYLL RIGHT HERE. TURNS THE UNDEAD TO ALIVE! NO FORTUNITE NEEDED! He took out the genyll. Anthony: I'm here. Just fire it up. Kato: YOU'LL PAY FOR THAT REMARK! YOU'LL ROT IN OUR PRISON ONCE YOU'RE ALIVE, JUST LIKE YOUR FRIENDS! Kato then turned the Genyll on. Anthony's Ghost Body became visible to everyone, and then became human. Anthony: I'm...ALIVE?!? Kato: Great, now get in that prison cell over there. I'll escort you. What Kato didn't know, was that something else was transpiring at the same moment. A Guard Came Running in. Guard: We got a flying object up in the sky. Identified as SPA Technology. Kato: Handle it! Guard: We'll need you. We're short on men. Kato: GAH! Fine, let's go. Kato locked Anthony up before he left. But he forgot about you. Meanwhile... PiX: Jimmy can't spot us, we'll have to flag him down! Rios: What?! PiX: Just make some noise. Rios pulled some loose gunpowder out of his pocket. They found a liter on the floor. PiX: This'll have to do. Back up! Rios threw the gunpowder in the air, and PiX threw the liter. Being it was in the air, the wall caught fire, according to plan. PiX: He'll notice us now! Just back up though! Rios: It's not that hot. Part of the wall came down. PiX: RIOS! Rios didn't answer. He was crushed under burning ceiling. PiX: RIOS!! Rios: I'm..finshed.jst..rn... It was hard for PiX to make out what he said. But then he realized, he was told to run. Suddenly, the bomb came down. PiX: WHAT THE!? PiX used the jutsu. PiX: Dude, not yet! AHH! WHAT THE HELL!!?! THIS CRAP IS ON MY HEAD! Jimmy: Dude, GET A TOWEL! YOU'LL DIE IF THAT STUFF BLOWS UP! PiX wiped his head on everything. The walls collapsed. As the walls collapsed, You had freed everyone on your team and were exiting the building. You: Alright, Head Count! Danny: PiX and Rios aren't here. Travis: They're probably responsible for the distraction...well played PiX. Danny: Yeah, but it looks like the end of the line for them. PiX; SUBSTITUTION JUTSU! You: PIX! PiX: I got them to bomb this place... PiX had paused to catch his breath. PiX: Rios was killed. PiX paused again. PiX: Get..in..the...plane..... PiX passed out. Danny had put two fingers on PiX's neck. Danny: He's got a pulse. You: Alright, he'll need medical attention. Now, where's this plane. The plane had landed. Jimmy: You're PiX's friends, right? You: Uhh...yeah... Jimmy: Good, get in. This place is gonna explode. Everyone piled in the aircraft. You took off, and KILL's HQ Exploded.Chapter 10: The Resolution?  Your team had arrived back to the HQ. You found it wrecked. Walker: THE HQ! Travis: THE FORTUNITE! You: We can redo the HQ. Danny: Are you all stupid? Get PiX to a hospital. Jimmy: I'll take him. I trained with him, I owe him. You: Alright. But let me get something out of the plane. You went into the plane. Walker: Now they can power up the Genyll..and.. Travis: All hope is lost. Anthony: Yeah.... You: Don't think anything'll happen. At least, if they don't have this. You showed that you were carrying the Genyll. Walker: You took it? You: Yeah, I wasn't gonna let them get the fortunite. I got it when no one was looking. Then, the main dashboard inside the HQ turned on, and had Kato on it. Kato: Well played. What's say we settle this once and for all? Gun Fight. You: No. Violence isn't the answer. Kato: It was to kill my father! You: That was once Violence was already threatened upon me. I don't deal the cards. Kato: I will avenge my father! Fight me, or I'll bomb New SimCity. You: No. Kato: I'LL KILL YOU ALL! JUST WATCH ME! Walker began to cry. You: Why're you...crying? Walker: I've contributed to Kato and Danny's suffering. I'm their uncle and legal godfather. Kato: WHAT!? I'LL-I'LL KILL YOU TOO! Walker: I deserve it. I was assigned a mission to kill my own brother. I caught him, but I just couldn't do it. You: So you let him get away, hoping I would catch him. And Kill him. Walker: Yes. And so you did. And after that, I couldn't bear the shame. I couldn't face Danny or Kato anymore. I couldn't talk to you after you quit. But I knew about Kato's plot. So I needed to recruit Danny, and you. Because you two were the only ones who could defeat him. Danny held a gun to Walkers head. Danny: Don't..move... Walker: I deserve it... Danny had shot the dashboard. Travis: I told him that they were implanting a tick in the dashboard through WiFi as we speak, that's why the coding was there. In other words, they were gonna listen in to our next move. You: Ah. But..what is our next move? KILL is pretty much destroyed.. Walker: But Kato won't rest until he gets the fortunite. The question is, will we attempt to Kill him? Danny: He deserves to die. You: I know, but we lost Rios in that last attempt..are we willing to risk it? Walker: I'm not sure. Danny: PiX endured similar suffering as Rios did. He should be the one to decide...once he becomes well, that is. Elliot: I agree with Danny Star: As do I. Kage: Hmph. One week later.... Doctor: You may now see PiX L. Perfect. You: Thanks. You entered PiX's room. His hair was stained white. Danny: How're you doing? PiX: Great for the damage I took. Travis: What happened to your hair?! PiX: The Chemical Explosive fell on my head. I'm lucky to have not blown up. Walker: We're in a dilemma. Elliot: We all agreed that you should decide the next move. PiX: We kill Kato. We still need to recover Buddy's corpse. And now, Rios's. You: But how? PiX: I took this before we left. He dug in his pocket. He took out twenty cents, which had made you think he was nearing insanity. You: What's special about that? PiX: This was carved from the fortunite. What they got was a replica. You: So...we have complete control to the Genyll. PiX: Pretty much. We can use it to kill Dankato. You: We shouldn't. Star: Why? Danny: What if it were lost in a skirmish? It's better off destroyed. He has no power anymore, so there's nothing stopping us from going all-out on him. PiX Smiled. PiX: I won't be ready for that mission, but it sounds like a plan. I won't be out for at least two weeks. Danny: Alright, so we have a plan now. Travis, get working on a tracker. I found a hair of his. Travis: Err..in what? Danny: His brush. All of have of him from our childhood. Travis: Alright. Danny: Hang in there, PiX. PiX: Will do. Everyone left, except PiX of course. They all went back to the ransacked HQ. Travis: Halfway done with a tracker. Anthony: Good. 20 Minutes Later... Travis: Finished! Danny: Good. I'll take that. It scanned the DNA. It located Kato at an Apartment Building in New SimCity, your town. Danny: So...he's in the Clock Circle Apartment Building. Room 2D. Travis: How are we gonna pull this off? The public shouldn't be aware of this threat they live right next to. Anthony: Agreed. Hmm...perhaps I can provide a distraction.Chapter 11: Mission Preparation  Anthony: Alright, I got my acoustic. Danny: I got the set of Forks. Travis: I've got the Duffle Bag. Walker: I have the ladder. You: And...I got the water gun. Anthony: Alright, we're ready. But we have to make sure Kato will be home for this. Elliot: Leave that to me. I'll be your eye in the sky. Anthony: This mission will be a secure victory. You: And just how do you assume that? Danny: His plan. Not like we have anyone else to follow. Then, there was a problem. Guard: You're coming with us. Danny: Doubt it. Danny pulled out a gun. The guards did too. Guard 2: Look, Kato only wants Danny, [NAME] and Walker. Danny won't even be hurt. Danny: Tell him he could go to hell, and he will. You'll see him there, don't worry. Danny shot. Guard 3: Big Mistake. IGNITE! Danny: What? Then, a fourth guard launched a flaming arrow at the HQ. Danny shot everyone in sight. Danny: DIE! ROT IN HELL YOU FILTHY SCUM! Guard 4: Never! He pulled out a gun and started shooting. Then, a blast was heard. It was Kato, holding a trigger to TNT. Kato: Finally, YOU'RE MINE! The TNT went off. Everyone got out of the building. Travis was a bit singed as were you, but no serious injuries. Kato: SHOOT THEM ALL! Guard 7: Listen to boss! Shoot! Kato left. He thought everyone was dead amist the smoke cloud created by the TNT. Guard 5: See any of em? Guard 6: Yeah! Keep shooting! One by one, they all went down. Star was using the same technique that they used to rescue Rios with here. They were dying easily. Except one, whom had pulled out his sword. Guard 7: Hmph. Star: It can't be.. Guard 7: But it is! Why do you think I never talked! It was to hide my identity. Travis: Who- Then, Guard 7 was shot. Danny: I knew something was up with Kage. Everyone alright? Star looked at her trainee. He was dying with a twitching eye. Kage: Save...me... Star stabbed him. Star: Filthy traitor. Anthony: We got everything we bought, right? Travis: Yeah, but I still don't see how this will help. Then, everyone turned around to see Danny staring at his mask. Danny: My Mask.. He saw the bullet hole. The mask saved his life. Anthony: Just get a new one. Anyways, we should probably all head home. Meet back here tommorrow at 1:00 PM for mission details.Chapter 12: The Deadly Guitar  Anthony's plan went into action. Everyone had Walkie-Talkies to communicate. Elliot went to go check up in the sky. Elliot: Yep, the lights are on and I can see him through the window. Mission's a go. Anthony: Alright, I'm headed to their room. Anthony knocked, and two guards answered. Anthony was in disguise, wearing a baseball cap, sunglasses, and Bandana as a scarf. Anthony: Hello, could you please give me a moment of your team. Guard 1: What is it? Anthony: I'd like to perform for you two. If you'd please step outside, that'd be great. Guard 2: Alright... Anthony began playing. The two guards loved his music. Anthony was a truly fantastic musician. He then began singing. Anthony: And after he went, his father died, his guardian lied, all the time he spent, was etched away... Guard 1: Nicely done. Anthony: Thanks, but there's more to it. Star fell from the ceiling and stabbed both guards. Being the door was closed, Kato had no clue what happened. Anthony and Star entered the apartment, and the rest of your team followed through the window, climbing up a ladder. You: Hello Kato, hiding out here? Kato: Guards! Seize them! Anthony opened the door a little so Kato could see the two murdered guards. Kato tried to jump out the window, but you put a gun up to him. He stopped. Danny: Now, cooperate us and you'll live in prison. Don't cooperate and you'll die. Kato: Danny, my dear brother.. Danny: Shut, Up! Danny gave a warning shot, just missing Kato. Kato: Please, no! You: We want to know what happened to Buddy and Rios's corpses. Kato: Never! I'll never tell you! Walker: Travis, bring out the water gun. Travis took it out. Kato: And what do you think that'll do. Walker: Watch. Walker sprayed Kato's eye. Kato: Egh...UGH! AHH! WHAT THE HELL IS IN THAT CRAP! Walker: Bleach. Kato: AHHH! Walker: It won't kill you. Danny: Now for the forks. I sharpened 'em myself. They hurt a lot, and last a while since they don't kill you. Danny wrestled Kato and pinned him down. He then stabbed him with a fork. Then two. Then three. Then so on. You: NOW TELL US WHAT HAPPENED TO THEIR CORPSES! Kato: Nev...er.... Danny: TELL US OR I SHOOT YOU! Kato: No. Danny reached for the trigger. Kato: WAIT! Danny: What'd you do to them? Kato: I tore them limb from limb! Danny shot. Danny: Rot in Hell. I don't care if you're my brother. The duffle bag please, Travis. Danny packed Kato and his two guards in the bag. They brought it back to your hotel room, across the city. Danny: Alright, he's gone. You: Yeah.. now about my house... Danny: Relax, I did it, alright. Walker had construction workers redo it, even better than before. You had smiled.Chapter 13: The End.  So, everything worked itself out. You moved back into your house, and became Walker's equal. There was an opening since Buddy's death. You visited the cemetery once a week, every week, to mourn Buddy. He died saving your aunt. You worked with Danny, PiX, Anthony and Travis for a while after. Anthony had been taking on a more dominant role, and Danny became a second leader. PiX recovered with his stained hair. He had no brain damage, which was a miracle. Elliot went back to SkyForce Central, where he regrouped into the Space Division with Commander Shepard and Isaac. Star and Jimmy went back to Japan and served as agents there. The HQ was rebuilt within a month. Kato had finally got what he wanted; to be with his father. KILL was later abolished. It would've declared bankruptcy had it not been abolished by the government. The Genyll became a distant memory, forgotten by everyone. And, a new mystery was to emerge from these forgotten memories.Trailer MySims Galaxy (Wii) Plot  For the script: MySims Galaxy Story You are found by a group called Galactical Force.

I tried to create a page for one of my Sim Characters and when I tried using the \"Character\" Option, everytime I tried to put a picture of my character, I kept getting a strange error. So it won't upload the image. Can I choose another option aside from \"Character\" like \"Blank\"? Would it still work? Sorry to bother you again ^^; Tara-chan 22:29, November 12, 2009 (UTC)Thanks cont.  What?! I could have sworn I uploaded it only once. O_O; Well I keep getting this \"Hyper text Download\" Hold On, I'll take a Snapshot of it. [1] [2] It tells me to download that first file, then I open it and it says what's on the second link... Except replace the \"j\"s with \"Tara\" This is really confusing. Tara-chan 23:36, November 12, 2009 (UTC)Thanks cont.  That would be cool, and if you could take down the Extra pictures somehow, that'd be twice as Awesome. But what am I gonna do if the website won't let me use the Higher Quality Picture?

Thanks so much for all your help! ^^Thanks cont.  Oh, one last thing. I'm reading that Fan Fiction you wrote called \"Survival for a Signature\" and it's Awesome! The character's are depicted perfectly, and it's very funny. Great job! ^^ No problem. I think you should continue it when you get the chance. Yeah, I might be that person. But there a lot of people on DA who like Buddy as well. x3;Can you please help me?  Hi I'm kinda new to all the wiki sites and everything so I'm having a tough time.

Trivia: My character wears those glasses, but in Mysims Agents he doesn't.That Guy in that Game  Hey Blanky. I was wondering what that Garque (I don't know if I spelled it write) Wonka (from MySims Quantum of Rock) guy's skin color was. Tan, White, or Black? I'm making a character (that you don't have to use) for your Quantum of Rock game. Sumaes01 00:26, May 25, 2010 (UTC)Saemyl Darry  Who's that sim to the Right?: I made you a Saemyl Darry that you don't have to use for your MySims\u00a0:: Quantum of Rock game but I wanted to help you out since you help me out with everything. I made a quick Biography about him. Biography: Saemyl Darry has never been the sharpest knife in the draw but he used sharpest knife in the draw to cut himself! Petal Lily Iris (the sharpest knife in the draw) is Saemyl Darry's battle friend who is always telling him what to do. One day, Saemyl Darry wanted to cut off some of his hair so he used something from the enviroment (a stick) since Petal Lily Iris says everything that elves use should be natural. He cut himself since the stick was associated with Petal Lily Iris on the \"elf's should grow out their hair thing\". Now, he has a very bloody forehead that is always bleeding (when it's not covered up by his hair) and now he grows out his hair and as a bonus for Petal Lily Iris, he's starting to grow out a beard! Sumaes01 20:38, May 25, 2010 (UTC)Whatever  Whatever. YUou don't have to use him for Saemyl Darry and you don't have to use him at all. I just made you a character for your game that you don't have to use. Sumaes01 23:56, May 25, 2010 (UTC)I didn't do a lot  Actually, I didn't do a lot. I just went in my basement, made the sim, took a picture of it with my computer, and made his eyes purple. I just made him because i was bored. Sumaes01 00:02, May 26, 2010 (UTC)Ad free  Hi!

Its creation was confirmed on November 2, 2006, by EA chief financial officer Warren Jenson who said, \"Yes, there's a Sims 3 in development and it's likely to be a fiscal '09 title.\" In July 2007 AI researcher Richard Evans, who is part of the TS3 team, gave a talk at the annual AIIDE (Artificial Intelligence and Interactive Digital Entertainment) conference in California, notes from which can be read here. The title was to be released on February 20, 2009 according to the official The Sims 3 website, but was delayed worldwide to June 2, 2009.Electronic Arts cites the reason for the delay was to \"create awareness for The Sims 3\". Before it was delayed, it was originally to be released only on Windows but after the delay, it is available on both Windows (Windows 98-10) and Mac OS X, which makes this the first time EA released The Sims on both Windows and Mac OS X (EA only made the Windows version of The Sims, The Sims 2 and The Sims Stories; Mac versions were made by Aspyr Media). In The Sims 2: FreeTime, a computer is delivered by Mr. Rod Humble to every household that a player plays. On it, Sims can play The Sims 3 game. A video of this can be seen on YouTube. It shows something towards a continuous, panning neighborhood, diagonal placings for objects, better lighting systems, and the ability to change shoes in the CAS, an ability previously limited to only console versions of The Sims. The preview only lasts about one minute, and has poor resolution. The Sims 3 official site also reveals that players now have greater customization options. Such things like personality, Create-A-Sim, and build mode have been expanded. The Sims 3 also is the first game to feature an open-world concept: players are no longer limited to single lots; they are able to explore the world in between and travel to lots without loading screens. The game compromises this by having much longer initial loading and saving screens. The game has disc-based copy protection \u2013 there is a Serial Code just like The Sims 2. To play the game no online authentication is required. This was done in response to consumer complaints with EA's other games that made use of SecuROM DRM, such as Spore.Description  The freedom of The Sims 3 will inspire you with endless creative possibilities and amuse you with unexpected moments of surprise and mischief! Create over a million unique Sims and control their lives. Customize everything from their appearances, to their personalities and even the home of their dreams. Then, send your Sims out to explore new locations around town and to meet other Sims in the neighborhood. Go online for exclusive extra game content and robust online features including $10 worth of free SimPoints and a bonus downloadable town. With all-new quick challenges and rewarding game play, The Sims 3 gives you the freedom to choose whether (or not!) to fulfill your Sims\u2019 destinies and make their wishes come true.Neighborhood  The neighborhood that ships with the game, Sunset Valley, is a beautiful setting with 97 lots full of characters. The description of this neighborhood reveals that The Sims 3 is indeed a prequel to The Sims and The Sims 2 (Although The Sims 3 is the successor to both games), as Sunset Valley was apparently built before Pleasantview, and founded by the Goth family. A second neighborhood named Riverview is available as a free download in The Sims 3 Store when the game is registered. The Sims 3: World Adventures introduced three sub-neighborhoods, Champs Les Sims, Shang Simla and Al Simhara. Each sub-neighborhood is a unique, exotic environment that is as large as a regular neighborhood. The Sims 3: Ambitions and The Sims 3 Deluxe compilation pack come with Twinbrook. The Sims 3: Late Night comes with the neighborhood Bridgeport. The Sims 3: Pets and The Sims 3 Plus Pets compilation pack comes with Appaloosa Plains. The Sims 3: Showtime comes with Starlight Shores. The Sims 3: Supernatural comes with Moonlight Falls. The Sims 3: University Life introduced a fourth sub-neighborhood named Sims University, where Young Adult or older Sims can go to college. The Sims 3: Island Paradise comes with Isla Paradiso. The Sims 3: Into the Future introduced a fifth sub-neighborhood named Oasis Landing. Aside from Riverview, more downloadable neighborhoods are available for sale from The Sims 3 Store. Barnacle Bay, a pirate-themed neighborhood, costs 2,000 SimPoints. Hidden Springs is a mountainous downloadable neighborhood on The Sims 3 website and costs 2,250 SimPoints. Sunlit Tides is a group of islands which has two versions: standard version costing 2,450 SimPoints and gold costing 4,350. Lunar Lakes is a neighborhood located on a foreign planet and costs 2,200 SimPoints. Lucky Palms, a desert-themed neighborhood, has two versions: standard and gold; the standard version costs 2,450 SimPoints, while the gold version costs 4,350. In December 2012, Monte Vista was available to download from The Sims 3 Store, and only came in a standard version. In February 2013, Aurora Skies was released to download from The Sims 3 Store. The standard version costs 2,450 SimPoints while the gold version costs 3,900 SimPoints. Dragon Valley, a medieval themed world, was released costing $20 for the standard version, and $30 for the gold version. In September 2013, a Gothic themed world, called Midnight Hollow costs 2,450 SimPoints for the standard and 4,350 for the gold. Roaring Heights featured a 1920s to 1940s world, costing $20 for the standard and $35 for the gold. A new neighborhood, Adventureland is shipped with patch 69. It is based on the base game neighborhood Sunset Valley, sharing the same description and image.Neighborhood Continuity  \"Before Pleasantview, there was Sunset Valley, founded by the Goths and built up by the Landgraabs to be a quiet, peaceful town. But when the Altos arrive with uptown ideals, will the townsfolk feel the need to choose sides?\" Sunset Valley, Riverview, and Twinbrook all take place before the events of The Sims (although at different times). Barnacle Bay is set after the events of The Sims 2. Although all other neighborhoods are not explicitly stated, they can be considered to take place before the events of The Sims. In an interview with producer Ben Bell and members from the EA Forum in the UK it's written \"He said that Sunset Valley itself is set before the neighborhood we see in The Sims, as if it's a prequel to the story we already know. He said the Goths are in the town, as their younger selves obviously as well as other familiar names and faces. Lots of new characters too.\" Agnes Crumplebottom does make an appearance as her younger self in Sunset Valley and players soon discover that the source of her crabbiness is due to the death of her husband who features as a ghost. Other families in Sunset Valley are the Landgraabs which are a very affluent family; the new Alto family, the Keaton family, the Wolff family, the Hart family, the Ursine family, as well as many others.Open Neighborhood  According to the Games for Windows magazine, \"The biggest change to The Sims 3 is that it takes place in a wide-open, constantly changing neighborhood \u2014 a much bigger sandbox.\" It was confirmed that the game would be an open neighborhood by the official website. The neighborhood is as such, and its neighborhood can be compared in vastness to the ones featured in other titles like Grand Theft Auto, Bully, Need For Speed Carbon and Burnout Paradise.  The loading of lots during play and lot-based playing has been eliminated. Now every action takes place in a seamless living neighborhood. In that Neighborhood there are lots, parks, shops and other places Sims like to explore. All Sims, and their Sim friends and family are in this Neighborhood. They can dine, visit, shop, and relax. Map Tags help players navigate the neighborhood, find interesting places to visit, and locate their Sims. Also, on the map, icons for buildings are different colors. Red icons are career buildings, royal blue icons are public places, light blue icons are for the location of Sims in the active household, orange icons are for other Sims' homes that the selected Sims knows, and green is the active household's house. There are also new public events in The Sims 3, such as music concerts, movie premieres, pool parties, barbecues, sporting events, outdoor fishing, and the most civic-minded public activity in a Sims game to date, attending a public protest at the City Hall, where Sims can voice their discontent with the administration's legal mumbo jumbo by angrily shouting their own nonsensical Simlish mumbo jumbo. When a child or teen Sim finishes school, there's a chance he or she may bring a friend home; there's also a chance the child or teen Sim may get invited over to a friend's house. The player has the option to accept or decline. Accepting, the player can then follow the Sim to their friend's house. Depending on how high their relationship is, the Sim can \"Request to Sleep Over\". If the friend accepts, they'll say, \"Sure, make yourself at home\". EA released a Create-a-World tool in December 2009, so players can create new neighborhoods for their Sims to live in.Buy Mode Build Mode Creatures Live Mode  The player has the ability to control one family at a time and can easily switch from one family to another. All the Sims of each city evolve together, but it is possible to stop the aging and the story progression so the Sims that the player doesn't control won't get married or evolve. Aging and story progression are different settings, and can be set independently. Both options affect the entire city and not an individual family. Free will can still be turned on and off, but also now has varying levels of High, Medium, Low, and Off. This setting is a game-wide setting rather than a save-specific setting. Currently, free will in The Sims 3 affects the entire city, not only the family the player is playing, which can cause non-player Sims, such as neighbors, to be passive. This was fixed with patches. The player can choose the length of a Sims life, from 25 Sim days (brief) to 960 Sim days (epic), and can also extend their life by eating a life fruit, a growable garden item. All Sims within the city will age according to the player's settings.Difficulty Levels  Families are rated by how difficult they are to play. Difficulty is based on Sim relations, traits, number of family members, and children. There are six levels of difficulty.Interactions with Other Sims  As Sims interact with other Sims, they learn about them. The opinion the Sim has with the Sim they are currently interacting with and their traits are displayed on the screen. The type of relationship a Sim has with another is displayed in the relationship panel. Each Sim has different interactions based on their traits.Sims  Improvements to Sims include more customization options, a trait system that creates unique personalities, Sims that take care of themselves, and wishes that allow the player to set short- and long-term goals.Create a Sim  Create a Sim now has more customizable options for Sims than the CAS in The Sims 2. The player now has a larger selection of body types for Sims, and are able to create different hair styles for every Sim. The player is now able to pick their Sim's shoes. There are a total of 22 hairstyles for female Sims and 17 hairstyles for male Sims. There are a variety of hats and hair accessories that the player can use, but they all come with set hairstyles. Each of the hats and accessories can also have their colors and textures altered. Hairstyles can be chosen separately for each outfit. Compared to previous games in the series, a lot more things can be modified. It is possible to just change the nose, for example, and it is possible to use the 'dot' system to go into more depth, i.e. change nostril definition, nose tip scale, bridge height, etc. Accessories can also be added (gloves, socks, eyeglasses, bracelets, earrings, shoes, watches...) and customized with Create a Style tool. There are more styles for hair than ever before. Changing hair/clothing/face is easy, as all can be customized. The player cannot add layers when customizing clothing, but if the clothes already have layers then the colors and textures for each layer can be altered. The player can also click on any part of the Sim and the Create a Sim tool takes them directly to the right menu for editing whatever is selected. There is an eyelash length slider bar. Socks and shoes are also fully customizable. The player can choose the Sim's full name, age, gender, skin tone, weight and muscle tone. There are six possible skintones but only three of the six are realistic. The other three are green, red, and blue. There is a slider so the player can edit how light or dark the skintone is. For example, they can make a light green Sim with a dark green mother and a light skinned father. Body modifiers also use sliders that adjust weight from thin to obese and muscle size from flabby to muscular. With patch 1.17.60, sliders for muscle definition and breast size (female only) were added. Height still cannot be changed (due to conflicts with animation).  Players can now create twins (triplets, quadruplets, etc.) in Create a Sim using this button. Five personality traits can be chosen for each Young Adult Sim and above, with the chance to change them with a Lifetime Happiness reward. (Younger Sims have fewer traits. A teen has 4 traits, kids have 3 traits, and toddlers have 2 traits. Some traits are not available for younger ages. For example, toddlers can't be Flirty. One Lifetime Wish is also chosen. In CAS, only young adults, adults, and elders can choose a lifetime wish, but in the game, children and teens can also choose to pursue a certain lifetime wish early. Players are also able to choose from three types of voices and a slider to choose the pitch of a Sim's voice.Ages  Age types of Sims within the game are baby, toddler, child, teenager, young adult (default age). Adult (middle age) and elder. The lifespan of a Sim can also be edited, making it any number of days between 25 and 960.Needs  Sims in The Sims 3 have six needs: hunger, bladder, fun, hygiene, energy, and social, omitting comfort and environment, two motives found in The Sims 1 & 2. (Though their function is replaced by certain moodlets.) Sims are able to take care of themselves, allowing the player to concentrate on what happens in their lives rather than balancing their needs. Sims now have wishes which can be fulfilled or ignored, and these often correspond with their needs (for example, a Sim may develop a wish to \"Order Pizza\" if they are hungry).Pregnancy  Pregnancy in The Sims 3 is similar to pregnancy in The Sims 2. Pregnant Sims experience the same belly expansion, though in The Sims 3 the expansion is gradual. Sims can now read books about pregnancy and get medical advice at the hospital. Sims can also announce they're pregnant to their husband/lover, family, friends, and just about any person they meet. A Sim relatively high in the Medical career track can also give the pregnant Sim some medical advice and determine the gender of the baby. Pregnancy lasts 3 days and during that time the Sim will have backache moodlets, cravings, and in the earlier days, morning sickness. They also have a positive \"Pregnant\" moodlet throughout the pregnancy. When the day comes, a message box will alert the player that the baby is on its way. Wherever the pregnant Sim is, she will have contractions. The player can have another member of the family drive the to-be mother to the hospital, or tell her to go on her own, (the father of the baby will join the mother at the hospital separately, after she has entered it, and this applies for if the father is in the active household or not). After a few Sim hours the Sim will emerge from the hospital with a little bundle of joy. Boys are wrapped in blue blankets, while girls are wrapped in pink ones. If your Sim gave birth at the hospital and had twins,each parent will carry one; if she has triplets, the mother will come out with a baby basket and remove the babies when she gets home (the basket will disappear). Depending on how the pregnancy went, the player can get to choose one of 2 traits, both, or none. After birth, the Sim gets an \"It's a Boy!\", \"It's a Girl!\", \"It's Twins!\" or \"It's Triplets!\" positive moodlet which lasts for 2 days. Both young adult and adult women can get pregnant, but young adults are more fertile. Sims can give birth at home or in the hospital. There is a possibility that a Sim will have twins or triplets. There are higher chances if the Sim has the \"Fertility Treatment\" Lifetime Reward or watched the kids channel on TV frequently or listened to kids music. Triplets, when born in the hospital, are carried out in a large basket by their mother/father.Traits  Traits are like segments of a whole personality that the player can assign to their Sims. They can combine to create increasingly complex personalities. There are 63 traits to choose from in the base game, with Expansion packs adding more, plus some hidden traits which can be passed on to the offspring of service Sims (firefighters, police officers, etc.) or from Sims in certain careers (such as the Criminal career). When the player assigns Traits to a Sim, that Sim will look and act the part. Toddlers, Children and Teens get a new trait at their birthday. If children had a good childhood, then the player can choose a trait. If not, the game will give them a random one, which is usually negative. They\u2019ll have unique behaviors, preferences and advantages. Some traits give special abilities. They can be useful towards skill improvement (Artistic and Athletic traits, for example) and special interactions (Childish Sims can play with toys. Mooch Sims can ask for food.) Young adults and up have 5 traits, teens have 4 traits, children have 3 traits, toddlers and babies have 2 traits. With University Life expansion pack, Sims might be able to earn additional 6th and 7th traits by graduating from the university or reaching level 8 of a social group. The fewer traits a Sim has, the less complex that Sim's personality will be. For example, giving a Sim the Kleptomaniac trait only will result in him constantly stealing while giving a Sim 5 traits will result in more balance. A Sim can have any combination of traits as long as they do not contradict each other. For example, a Sim cannot be both \"Good\" and \"Evil\". Traits are genetic and what occurs during pregnancy can affect what traits are passed on. The parents also help pick the traits. For example, bad parents don't get to pick their own traits and will have randomly assigned ones that are generally unfavorable. NPCs can also pass on secret traits that only their children will get. The Lifetime Reward \"Midlife Crisis\", costing 20,000 Lifetime Rewards points, allows the player to choose a Sim's traits again.Wishes  Wishes are exclusive to The Sims 3 and provide the player with a wide selection of requests that keep their Sims happy as well as working towards some short and long-term goals and rewards. Wishes come from anywhere and everywhere, based on the Sims\u2019 Traits, their job, their skills, their friends or coworkers, where they are in town, or what they might be doing. The player can promise to help their Sims with a wish or throw it away. Satisfying these basic tasks will unlock minor rewards and increase the Sim's overall morale with a \"moodlet\"\u2014a minor condition that contributes to the characters' overall mood. Evil Sim just stole candy from a baby? This is considered a positive moodlet for this Sim. Having to listen to the annoying sound of the crying baby? This is considered a negative moodlet. Working toward a Lifetime Wish will win the Sim \"Lifetime Happiness Points\" that can be spent on extremely powerful items, including the teleporter The player is now free to pick or ignore their Sims\u2019 wishes without fear of some sort of mental breakdown. Instead, they really get to focus on telling the story and making decisions; the Sim just makes suggestions along the way.Lifetime Rewards  Points gained from wishes may be spent on rewards, either in the form of an object or a permanent change in the Sim. For example, with 20,000 points the player can choose to buy the lifetime reward \"Mid-Life Crisis\" for their Sim, which allows them to pick their traits again.Skills  Skills have been expanded on from previous versions adding two skills that were Talent Badges in The Sims 2 (fishing and gardening), and two that were hidden skills (writing and painting), plus 18 more skills added by various expansion packs. Four additional skills were also introduced from The Sims 3 Store and they include Artisan, Dancing, Gambling, and Violin. They still have 10 levels of proficiency with the exception of collecting. Sims with high levels in a skill will unlock new abilities. For example, having a high level of logic allows a Sim to tutor other Sims, cooking unlocks recipes, fishing unlocks bigger fish, etc. Sims get a \"Power Study\" moodlet if they study at the Library, which helps with skill-building. Some skills have a series of books, many of which can be found at the library. Reading these books increases the Sim's skill level for the skill in question. For example, reading a book about charisma will increase the Sim's level in charisma. The player does not see the skill in the interface until they unlock the first point, which can be done by attending a class or reading a book about the skill. The player can then view the skill journal. The skill journal displays statistics and information about challenges, for example, the Athletic skill journal displays the number of hours of cardio workout, hours of strength workout, and distance jogged. The skill journal will display other information depending on the skill. For instance Cooking will display the recipes learned and the quality at which the Sim can produce that meal. The statistics and challenges for Collecting are available in the skill journal. Also when Sims reach level 10 of a skill, they will get a certificate in the mail to display on a wall or sell for 1000 Simoleons.Careers  Many of the careers from The Sims 2, such as the Law Enforcement and Professional Sports tracks, are in The Sims 3. Of course, there are also some new ones. Sims can look for these jobs in the newspaper or apply right at the building where they\u2019d like to work. (Every career has a building in the neighborhood.) Sims are also able to make a living at home selling paintings, writing novels, or growing fruit and vegetables. To get some extra cash on the side if the Sim also has some cash to spare, they can buy out businesses and receive a percentage of the profits they earn. If Sims are less inclined towards pursuing a full-time career or are too busy skill-building, etc., they can get part-time jobs at certain career locations within the town. (Part-time jobs have a lower pay than full-time jobs and do not give career opportunities.) Part-time jobs are also available for teen Sims. Advancing in a career still depends on mood and skills, but also relationships with colleagues/boss and even certain goals that have to be fulfilled. The player can decide how hard they work while on the job. The option to work hard will increase the Sim's performance faster at the expense of their mood. Taking work home, schmoozing the boss, reading medical journals, or completing opportunities also have an impact on a Sim's job performance. Chance cards and at-work events can still cause the Sim to lose their job, but may actually help them get a better job in another career track. Reaching the top of a career doesn't mean they're done, either. If a Sim keeps excelling at their duties, they can rake in extra Simoleons through additional raises. A new feature The Sims 3 offers is branching careers, which allows Sims to choose a certain path in their career (for example, a Sim in the Music career can eventually choose to specialize in Symphonic music or Rock). The Sims 3: Ambitions introduces professions, careers that allow the player direct control over their Sims\u2019 work and how they spend their days, and the ability for Sims to register at City Hall as self-employed in a skill career.Features added with patches  Game Update 1.5/1.6 on 11/16/09 introduced several features from World Adventures such as the new basement tool that allows players to build basements up to 4 levels deep under a lot, new Pagoda style roofs, and the ability to place decorations on roofs.

World Adventures, Plus Late Night and Plus Generations also include a $10 card worth 1,000 SimPoints.The Leak  On May 19, 2009, about 2 weeks before the release, a pre-release version of The Sims 3 was leaked onto the internet. The game was essentially as feature-complete as with the final retail build, but it was, according to EA, \"buggy\" and \"pre-final\", with certain features missing and is considered by the developers to be unstable. It was previously stated that players who own the leaked version of The Sims 3 would not be able to access The Sims 3 Store and would not be able to buy items from it. It is possible to report illegal copies of the game to EA.Expansion Packs  There have been 11 expansion packs for The Sims 3 developed by Maxis between 2009 and 2013.Stuff Packs  There have been 9 stuff packs released by Maxis for The Sims 3 between 2010 and 2013.Downloadable Worlds  Maxis also has a development team dedicated to creating premium neighborhoods for The Sims 3 available on The Sims 3 Store and in retail stores.

The main part of the town is the park, where Sims can have a picnic, go fishing, or take a stroll and maybe meet someone new; there are also cinemas, gyms, restaurants, shops, pools, and other recreational facilities. Sims can now visit all their friends' and neighbors' homes and call up their friends with the new cell phone, for a night on the town. Sunset Valley mixes modern and futuristic building ideas with nostalgic architecture and design rooted in American suburbs of the 1950s. The town is very unique on all accounts and hosts a whopping 25 playable families. Sunset Valley is full of places to explore and has a very diverse cityscape, leaving players hours of fun while exploring alone. The houses in Sunset Valley are diversely priced, but every little group of houses are generally similarly priced. For example, the homes by the public beach are generally cheap, making them homes for lower-middle class type Sims, although (if viewing the water as south), the further west you go the nicer they become, until they're more like upper-middle class type homes. Summer Hill Court contains the largest, most expensive lots. The area directly behind city hall has some of the poorest houses, and behind that zone is a middle class area. Along the east side of Sunset Valley are some very nice homes, probably for upper-middle class Sims. There are 21 available empty lots for players to build on. They are priced from \u00a71200 at the cheapest, to \u00a714,700 as the most expensive. The amount of space (in squares) for building goes from 19x29 at the smallest to 60x60 at the largest. The most expensive lot, 15 Summer Hill Court, is on the same hill as the Landgraabs' and Alto's mansions (although if the Pets expansion pack has been installed, this lot may be taken up by the equestrian center).Lots Residential lots Inhabited  All owned are considered households.Empty Lots Community lots  Rabbit holes are not listedFamilies New families  There are a total of 86 Sims living in Sunset Valley.Returning families Families in the Family bin Homeless Sims  These Sims are pre-made, but homeless when Sunset Valley is first loadedMobile version  Sunset Valley was totally different in the mobile version. The park in the middle of town was replaced with a small lake, and only a few neighborhoods and families from the PC version were found here.Trivia The Sims 3: Ambitions  The Sims 3: Ambitions is the second expansion pack for The Sims 3 released on June 1, 2010. It allows players to become \"fearless heroes and ace entrepreneurs\". In other words, it's a career oriented expansion pack, a spiritual remake of The Sims 2: Open for Business, but with added activities. Ambitions also appears to be somewhat related to The Sims 2: FreeTime. EA Games confirmed Ambitions on March 4, 2010. The Sims 3: Ambitions is also available for feature phones, iPhone and iPod touch. There are new features such as babies and being able to fully edit your home. A free patch for The Sims 3 was released on May 28, 2010. It introduced tattoos and other updates to the base game. The new Create a Pattern tool is a free download just like the Create a World tool, and was released on June 23, 2010.Description  Imagine a world where you can make your Sim anything they want to be. Widen your Sim's horizons with a bunch of killer career opportunities. With The Sims 3: Ambitions, decide whether your Sim will be the brave town hero, cause loads of mischief among their neighbors, or give some style advice. Make your Sim save the day as a brave firefighter, change your town as a leading architect, or live on the edge as a tattoo artist. Will your Sim find success as a billionaire high-tech inventor or eke out a living as a bumbling mad scientist? Will they uncover secrets as a private investigator by dusting for prints or roughing up a suspect for information? Will they walk the runways as a fashion diva with exhilarating and swanky style? Their future is entirely in your hands!Game Summary  The Sims 3: Ambitions allows players to pursue a variety of exciting paths and careers in their Sims\u2019 lives that in turn affect their overall gameplay experience and neighborhood. While on the job, the player has direct control over their Sims\u2019 work and can choose how to spend their days. Players can opt to make house calls and save lives as a doctor or choose the devious route and test experimental medicine on patients. Be the heroic firefighter tackling raging infernos or smashing everything in sight at the victim\u2019s home with an axe; take a shot at solving cases as an investigator, nicely convincing sources to divulge secrets or roughing up perpetrators in a dark alley to get information. Players can now experience some of the most exciting and varied jobs. In The Sims 3: Ambitions, players can choose to hunt down vengeful spirits as the ghost hunter, invent brilliant and potentially destructive gadgets as an inventor, craft glorious masterpieces as a sculptor, and solve riveting cases by any means necessary as an investigator with dozens of cases to solve and numerous clues to find. Additionally, players will be able to change the look and feel of their town by becoming an architect and directly affecting the neighborhood around them leveraging Build and Buy mode. The stylist career and new tattoo system allow players to make over their Sim neighbors in fashionable or catastrophic ways. For the first time, players will be in charge of how their Sims\u2019 career progresses and decide if they will work for good or evil, pursue creative endeavors or technical affairs, climb to the top quickly, or be a slacker. The future of a Sims\u2019 success or failure is entirely in the hands of the player.Features Leaked images  In May 2010, leaked images of Ambitions surfaced, allegedly through a Russian journalist breaching disclosure policies. These images were distributed more widely by the Brazilian fan website, O Sim BR.net. The legal ramifications of republishing these images is currently unknown. The images show a clear overhead view of Twinbrook, confirming it as the town in the second trailer (Iron Man parody). They also show an explosion at a junkyard, the inside of a salon, a secret agent in 'disguise', a Sim at a drafting board, several new hair styles, applying tattoos, a clothes line, and a new motorbike.Trivia Advanced Cheats  The icons that are shown on the map are shown in numerous colors. To buy and build modes Purchase / Construction in all situations, freely. For example, during a fire and burglar. Allows use of foundation on top tile floors.External links The Sims 3: Generations  The Sims 3: Generations is the fourth expansion pack for The Sims 3. The game was released on May 31, 2011. It contains elements of The Sims 2: Celebration Stuff, The Sims 2: Family Fun Stuff, The Sims: House Party, The Sims 2: Teen Style Stuff, The Sims 2: FreeTime, and The Sims 2: University. Each life phase has a theme. For children, imagination and make-believe are key themes. For teens, rebellious, chaotic scenes such as parties and pranks are an addition. As a young adult and adult, the focus is on their relationships with others, from getting married to having children of their own. Elders get to enjoy their time reminiscing about the golden years and the joys of watching their grandchildren grow up. There are also now 5 schools (including Military school, Prep School and Art School) for Children and Teenagers to go to.Description  Enjoy a whole spectrum of rich life experiences with your Sims! Start off in the imagination-fuelled world of childhood and embrace the drama of the teen years. Experience the complicated realities of adult life, then reap the benefits of growing up in each life stage. A wealth of new options and activities makes your Sims' lives more meaningful than ever before, whatever their ages. With new celebrations, dramatic life events, and all-new ways for your Sims to express their creativity, The Sims 3 Generations lets your Sims live life to the fullest!Features Pre-Release  A trailer, which later turned out to be legitimate, was leaked on March 11, 2011 from The Sims 3's official twitter and Facebook. The trailer was leaked along with a trailer for a then-unconfirmed expansion pack, \"Unleashed\" (later confirmed as The Sims 3: Pets). Features shown in the trailer include tree houses, on-the-ground water slides, spiral staircases, mid-life crisis, family videos and pranks. On April 5, 2011, EA confirmed the rumors with a press release, followed by an official release of the trailer.Music  This is a list of artists and their songs that were featured in Generations:External links Pregnancy  Pregnancy is a game mechanic and multiple-day event that begins after a successful \"Try for Baby\" interaction between two Sims of the opposite sex, and ends with the pregnant female Sim giving birth to one or more newborn babies. Pregnancy primarily affects adult and young adult female Sims. Pregnancy brings many physical and lifestyle changes to the pregnant Sim, including increasing body size, faster-decreasing motives, and forced maternity leave from work. Pregnancy was introduced as a game feature in The Sims 2, and has appeared in each subsequent game. Prior to The Sims 2, kissing or playing in bed were the only interactions that could result in two Sims having a child - and the player could usually say yes or no to that. If the player said \"yes\", or was not given that option, a baby would immediately appear, forgoing any pregnancy period. Under normal circumstances, only female Sims can become pregnant. However, in The Sims 2 and in The Sims 4: Get to Work, male Sims can be impregnated as well, either through alien abduction or by the use of cheats. In The Sims 3: Seasons, male Sims can experience a sort of pseudo-pregnancy as the result of alien abduction. In The Sims 4, as of patch 34, a Sim's ability to get pregnant or get others pregnant can be set with the optional Customize Gender menu in CAS, regardless of the Sim's gender.Conception  To get a Sim pregnant, the two partners must \"Try for Baby\". When trying for a baby, there is a possibility that the Sim will not get pregnant, but if she does, the player will hear a lullaby song or jingle; signaling a successful conception. In The Sims 4, the lullaby song was removed, and Sims can use the pregnancy test on the toilet for a cost of \u00a715.\u00a0 In The Sims 2, only adults and elder males can initiate Try for Baby, although the InTeenimater mod can allow teens to become pregnant. (While young adult males can father children with adult females, the \"Try for Baby\" interaction must be initiated by the adult female at her home.) If the Sim is infertile, the player can testingcheatsenabled and spawn the Tombstone of Life and Death to impregnate a Sim. The number of babies born is determined at conception, but the gender is determined at birth. Male young adults, adults, and elders can try for a baby, but only female young adults and adults can get pregnant. Additionally, the chance of conception is lowered for older female Sims trying for a baby. Depending on what the player does or exposes the mother to during her pregnancy, it will affect both the gender and number of offspring the pregnancy will produce. In The Sims Medieval, WooHoo between two Sims of the opposite gender always carries a chance of pregnancy; there is no \"Try for Baby\" option.Meeting aliens  This section describes features that are only available in The Sims 2,\u00a0 The Sims 3: Seasons,\u00a0and The Sims 4: Get to Work.The Sims 2  In The Sims 2, when an adult male stargazes with the Farstar e3 telescope at night, there is a chance that he will be abducted by aliens. If he is, he will return after a few Sim hours, and will soon learn that he is pregnant. (Female Sims and male Sims of different ages can be abducted, but only adult males will become pregnant as a result of an abduction.) If NightLife is installed, an adult male Sim abducted from the ElectroDance Sphere will return pregnant. The Nightlife patch fixed a glitch which allowed young adult males abducted from the ElectroDance Sphere to return pregnant. If FreeTime or later is installed, Knowledge Sims with the Summon Aliens aspiration benefit can use either telescope to attempt to summon aliens; so an adult male Sim with that benefit can use it to attempt to become pregnant.The Sims 3: Seasons  There's a 33% chance a young adult or older male who has been abducted by aliens may receive the \"Unexpected Weight Gain\" moodlet after the \"Abducted\" moodlet has expired. While the Sim will give birth after the \"Unexpected Weight Gain\" moodlet has expired, he is not otherwise treated as pregnant. He will not be given maternity leave, will not change into maternity clothes, will not be restricted from activities that pregnant Sims normally cannot do, and will not pass on any genetic information to the alien child. It has been noted that this can only happen if the aliens performing the abduction are not residents of the neighborhood.The Sims 4: Get To Work  There is a possibility that a Sim will be abducted during the 9PM to 4AM hours. Male Sims may come back pregnant with an alien baby after abduction, as well as receiving the \"Abducted\" moodlet. Female Sims cannot be impregnated by aliens, but will still receive the moodlet.Vacation Romance  This section describes features that are only available in The Sims 3: World Adventures. In The Sims 3: World Adventures, it is possible for a Sim to have WooHoo with someone from the place they are visiting on their holidays. If a male Sim were to WooHoo with a female Sim who lives in his holiday destination (i.e. China, France or Egypt), it is possible for the female Sim to get pregnant. But when the male Sim returns home, his offspring can be seen on the family tree as a child, even if the WooHoo occurred the previous day. This jump in age occurs due to the fact that pregnant females, babies, and toddlers are not present in foreign destinations. In addition, Story progression is at a catch-up rate, meaning the offspring will not immediately show any age progressions through the family tree. Meanwhile, a female Sim who does the same will return home and give birth to the child, and the family tree will show who the father is; the baby will grow up in a normal pace.Duration  Pregnancies last 75 Sim hours in The Sims 2 and 72 Sim hours in The Sims 3 though it's common to refer to pregnancies as lasting 3 days in both games. In The Sims 4, pregnancies can last up to 3\u20135 days. In The Sims FreePlay, pregnancies last approximately 216 hours (9 days). The Sims 2 has cheats which can be used to reduce the gestation period to a mere 2 hours of Sim time. The lifespan setting in The Sims 3 does not normally affect the duration of a pregnancy. The motives of a pregnant Sim will drop at an increased rate, even if the Sim is not visibly pregnant. In The Sims 2, Sims who are able to meditate will still be able to do so while pregnant. In The Sims 2, it is possible to calculate the time in which the Sim will expand each day and eventually give birth. From the hour in which a Sim becomes pregnant, she will expand 25 Sim hours later each day until she gives birth. So a female who becomes pregnant at one o'clock on Tuesday, will expand at two on Wednesday, three on Thursday, and give birth at four on Friday. In The Sims 3, a Sim who is at level 5 or higher in the Medicine career track can determine the gender of the baby.First Trimester  The first trimester lasts one day only. During this trimester the pregnant Sim will suffer from morning sickness, which usually leads them to throwing up in the toilet, with a thought bubble showing a pacifier and a question mark. In The Sims 2, Sims with high body skill may have a better chance of not throwing up, though they will still be visibly queasy, and their comfort meter may at times go into the red. Sims do not always throw up when pregnant, but they may wake up in the middle of the night to vomit. In The Sims 2, the Sim will not be visibly pregnant. In The Sims 3, the bulge cannot be seen unless the player zooms in. Sims with the grumpy trait will be aggravated by morning sickness. During the first trimester, the pregnant Sim can't leap into other Sims' arms and other Sims can't leap into her/his arms. Pregnant Sims in The Sims 2 may have random drops in the hunger motive, which may take newer players by surprise. Also if a Sim suffers from morning sickness, and there is no toilet on the lot, the Sim will throw up on the floor/ground instead. In The Sims 4, the player can have the prospective mother do a pregnancy test after trying for a baby. This is done by selecting the action at the toilet. If the Sim is pregnant, a \"First Trimester\" moodlet will appear, and will last 24 hours.\u00a0When a pregnancy test is not done the Sim will appear pregnant around 24 hours after conception.Second Trimester  The second trimester lasts one day. At some point in the day, the pregnant Sim will attract the player's attention and change appearance. Their abdomen will expand and they will begin to wear maternity clothing. In The Sims 3, the bulge is nearly non-existent at first, but progressively grows larger. If the pregnant Sim has a job, they will be placed on maternity leave, and the carpool will not appear. In The Sims 2, however, a pregnant Sim who has access to a car can drive to work. In The Sims 2, the Sim will be paid for these leave days even if they fall on one of their days off. Also, in The Sims 2, calling a Sim who is on maternity leave during his or her work hours will still result in the \"<Sim> is working\" messages, and a Sim who \"brings a friend\" home from work may bring a pregnant Sim. There will be new social interactions, \"Rub Belly\" and \"Talk to Belly\" ; \"Feel Tummy\", \"Listen to Tummy\", and \"Talk to Tummy\", and the pregnant Sim may \"Ask to Feel Tummy\". The pregnant Sim and father can announce the pregnancy to others. In The Sims 2, a Sim at this point will no longer be able to do yoga or work out in front of a stereo, but will be able to work out in front of a television. The Sim may be able to use some types of exercise equipment, but will not be able to use all types. The combined effects of pregnancy and working out will be hard on the Sim's motives, but this does not appear to pose any other risk. A pregnant Sim will be able to swim, but will be unable to use a diving board or pool slide. Pregnant Sims in the second and third trimesters can also expect to have cravings, in the form of more \"Eat...\" wants/wishes (depending on which game) for specific foods. These are easy to fulfill, since they'll usually be a dish the Sim knows how to cook. In The Sims 4, a Sim in the second trimester may get a morning sickness moodlet upon waking from sleep. This will make them uncomfortable, and possibly even make them throw up.Third Trimester  The third trimester lasts one day. The expectant Sim will get the attention of the player and the abdomen will enlarge again. They can no longer drive, take a taxi, use the swing, or use the electro-dance sphere from Nightlife. They will suffer from mood swings, in which the outcome of Social interactions between the pregnant Sim and another will change. In The Sims 3, they will get negative moodlets, such as the \"Sore\" moodlet, and may no longer run. In The Sims 4, the third trimester can last 1 or more days, as birth can happen at any time rather than at a set time as in previous games.Birth  On the last day of the pregnancy the Sim will attract the viewer once again and go into 'labor'. This is an autonomous action and all Sims on the lot or nearby will be drawn to the Sim to 'panic'. In The Sims 3 and in The Sims 4: Get to Work, the pregnant Sim can be taken to the hospital when clicked on while in labor, or they can stay at home, and have a safe and comfortable birth. The advantages of giving birth at the hospital are that the baby's bassinet will be provided free of charge and the all of pregnant Sim's motives will be replenished. In The Sims 2, a screen will come up with the message \"There's a new family member on the way!\" or \"There's TWO new babies in the family!\" (if the Sim is having twins)\u00a0at which time the genetics and gender of the new baby (or babies) are determined. If the special camera is enabled, a cinematic will commence showing the birth of the baby,\u00a0otherwise the Sim will turn around on the spot and a\u00a0new family member is born. If the Sim has a job, they will get additional leave in the form of three vacation days, regardless of the number of vacation days they already have. These work like ordinary vacation days; if the Sim is scheduled to work, the carpool will come, and the Sim will get in unless the player cancels that action. These vacation days will not be lost if they are not used while the new family member is a baby. If another family member can stay home with the baby, the player may want to let the Sim go to work in order to save a leave day for later. In The Sims 3 a little pop-up will say: \"The baby is coming! Make sure (Sim) is at home or in the hospital so she can have a safe and comfortable birth!\" If the Sim goes to the hospital, the player won't be able to see anything, but can still hear the birth taking place. If the Sim stays at home, the Sim will turn on the spot, and the new little family member will be born there. In The Sims 4 labor lasts several hours. The Sim can continue to do things while in labor but will be continuously uncomfortable. If the player bought a bassinet previously, the Sim will go to the bassinet to give birth when the time comes. If they didn't, a bassinet will spawn spontaneously when the baby is born. After the birth of\u00a0the baby (or babies), the player will\u00a0then be able to name them. In The Sims 3, depending on how happy the mother was during her pregnancy, the player might be able to choose both traits for the baby, just one, or none at all.Multiple Births  The Sims 3 and The Sims 4 allows for the birth of both twins and triplets. The Sims 2 only allows for twins, though there are third-party hacks which can produce triplets and quadruplets. Some players have also had a glitch producing triplets in The Sims 2 and quadruplets in The Sims 4.Twins  Twins are conceived the same way as single babies, so they will look about as much like each other as normal siblings do\u2014from nearly identical to widely different. With, for example, a light-skinned mother and dark-skinned father, the twins can have different skin colors. However, some pre-made twins, such as the Pleasant twins, are identical; and it's possible to make identical Sims in CAS. CAS in The Sims 3 and the Sims 4 even has an option to create a twin, which creates an identical copy of a Sim. Every pregnancy has a low chance of producing natural twins. Most Sims have about a 10% chance of having twins, although if a parent is a twin themselves, the chances increase slightly. This is decided at the moment of conception, so, unlike gender and genetics, exiting and reloading the lot will not change the number of babies born. However, with the Open for Business expansion pack for The Sims 2, EA did include a \"forcetwins\" cheat; using it when a pregnant Sim is selected will result in that Sim having twins. If a pregnant Sim eats cheesecake, also added in Open for Business, they will have twins, as if the \"forcetwins\" cheat had been used while they were selected. This is different from what is stated in the Prima guide for Open for Business; the guide states that eating cheesecake while pregnant increases the chance of twins, not that it ensures them. There was a myth that eating cheesecake prior to conception would increase the chance of having twins. Whether or not this is what EA originally intended, it is not true. Enabling testingcheatsenabled and shift-clicking a pregnant woman allows the player to force twins by clicking on DEBUG: force twins. In The Sims 4, twins share the same birthday.Triplets/Quadruplets  Under normal circumstances, it is impossible to have triplets, quadruplets or more in The Sims 2. Players may download third-party hacks to obtain the option of having triplets or quadruplets. When having triplets or quadruplets, the game informs players that the Sim in question has given birth to two babies, despite the actual number. Players are still able to name each child, though, as the option pops up twice. In The Sims 3, a player can use the fertility treatment to get twin and triplets, but not quadruplets. Players may download third-party hacks to obtain the option of having quadruplets. In The Sims 4, players can buy the \"Fertile\" trait from the satisfaction reward store to increase the chances of getting twins or triplets. In City Living, players may also use the \"On Ley Line\" lot trait to boost the chances of conceiving twins.Increasing Multiple Birth Odds Stopping A Pregnancy The Sims  There is no pregnancy in The Sims, but if a family is evicted while there is a baby in the house, the baby will be lost.The Sims 2  Miscarriage per se does not occur in The Sims 2, but if a pregnant Sim dies, the baby will effectively be lost, as in the case of Olivia Monty's unborn baby. Family members will not get a memory of losing the baby, only the Sim who died. If the pregnant Sim is resurrected, their pregnancy will continue as normal. The only exception to this is Olivia Monty, who lacks a pregnancy token and merely has the appearance of being pregnant. If a pregnant Sim becomes an elder, the baby will be lost. Normally, a Sim who is close enough to elder-hood for that to happen cannot become pregnant. However, negative effects of drinking the Elixir of Life can age a pregnant Sim to the point where it becomes possible, or even move the Sim into the elder life stage. In addition, there are hacks which can be used to end a pregnancy.The InTeenimater  With the InTeenimater, a mod for The Sims 2, the player can make a miscarriage when a Sim is pregnant. She will have a miscarriage in her memories. The PlumbBob will glow red, and the Sim will start grasping for her stomach. A thought bubble with a pacifier and a question mark will come up. The Sim will then be in her normal clothes, and start crying. The pregnancy may even end with a miscarriage (autonomously), if the pregnant Sim's motives are low, specifically hunger and energy. The player may also choose an option known as \"End Pregnancy\" which will stop the pregnancy completely, meaning that the Sim will lose the baby but will have no emotional distress or memories of losing the baby.The InSimenator  With the InSimenator, a player can buy the Reproductive Adjustor, which looks like a microwave oven. If the player selects a pregnant Sim and clicks on the Reproductive Adjustor, one of the options will be \"Abort Pregnancy\". Aborting a pregnancy sometimes makes the mother depressed. Another option on the Reproductive Adjustor is \"Suspend Pregnancy\", which will pause the pregnancy until the Reproductive Adjustor is used to resume it.The Sims 3  In The Sims 3, it is not possible for a pregnant Sim to lose the baby, without any cheats. In The Sims 3, if a Sim is impregnated or turns pregnant before becoming an elder, the process of aging is simply suspended until after the baby is born. It also appears that pregnant Sims in The Sims 3 cannot die, and will avoid or survive events that would normally result in death, even if those events are arranged by the player. Sims who have successfully conceived, but haven't realized they are pregnant, cannot die as well. There are many mods that will stop a pregnancy, however most of them don't have any negative effects on the Sim. If the player clicks on the pregnancy moodlet while pressing the Ctrl key with testingcheatsenabled on, it will not stop the pregnancy but simply deny the mother a happy moodlet during her entire pregnancy. If this happens to the \"Baby Is Coming!\" moodlet, the mother will remain pregnant but never give birth until the game is restarted. In several pregnancy mods, there are varying \"End Pregnancy\" options, some giving moodlets such as \"Broken Heart\" or \"Strained\".Increasing Specific Gender Odds The Sims 2  There is currently no definitely known way to influence the gender of an unborn child in The Sims 2. The only way to change the outcome is if the player saves while the mother is going through the labor animation, (or any time during pregnancy) before the \"new baby on the way\" popup comes up and the birth cutscene begins. If, after the birth, the baby is not the desired gender, the player can exit the lot without saving and go through the sequence again; this can be repeated until the baby is the desired gender. Since the chance of getting either gender is about 50%, this can take any number of tries to succeed. No Maxis cheat or fan-made hack exists to force a gender, though there have been many rumors, none of which are true. These include a fake \"boolprop force[gender] 100\" or the \"twinsr2cute\" cheats. Another rumor is that if a pregnant Sim eats gelatin it will increase the chance for a girl. It has also been rumored that the baby will be a boy if the father initiates the \"Try For Baby\" action, and will be a girl if the mother initiates it. However, this has been disproven. Making a Sim pregnant by themselves using the Tombstone of Life and Death will result in a baby that is always the opposite gender of the Sim giving birth.The Sims 3  In The Sims 3, there are ways to increase the chance to have male or female babies. Eating 3 or more apples during the pregnancy in each trimester will greatly increase the chances for the baby being a boy, while\u00a03 or more watermelons during each trimester will greatly increase the odds of having a girl. If the Sim is carrying twins or triplets, there is still a chance that both boys and girls will be born. Also, if a mother asks a Level 5 Medical Career Sim for the gender and eats the fruit for the opposite gender (e.g. hears from the Medical Sim that she's pregnant with a boy and then eats watermelon) there is a possible chance for fraternal twins born with different genders. Patch 1.3 of The Sims 3 keeps the apples for boys, watermelons for girls system, however eating these in prepared foods will not affect the gender. For example, watermelon pancakes will not increase the chances for a girl. There are many mods that allow the players to choose a baby's gender or tweak the chances in one direction or the other, but these mods all have their own rules and may not be subject to information given here.The Sims 4  Patch 17 introduced a method for influencing the gender of offspring. Eating strawberries or listening to pop music will increase odds for having a girl, while eating carrots or listening to alternative music increases the likelihood of having a boy.Pets  Like Sims, female pets are able to become pregnant and give birth.The Sims: Unleashed  Pets, like Sims, cannot become pregnant per se. However, if a male and female pet have a good relationship, they can \"snuggle\", which can lead to the player being asked whether or not they should have a kitten/puppy. Once the kitten/puppy is born, there will be a small box with a sheet over it near the mother, and the Sim(s) will \"welcome\" it by clapping at it. The kitten/puppy cannot be fed or played with, only viewed by Sims (while pets watch it), so when it comes to taking care of it, the player has to make sure the mother is doing okay. If not, then animal control will come to take the kitten/puppy away. After 3 Sim days, the kitten/puppy becomes fully grown. Pets born in-game have no personality points.The Sims 2: Pets  In The Sims 2, a Sim can command a pet to WooHoo in a large pet house with another pet of the opposite gender, provided that the Sim has a good relationship with the pet being commanded and the two pets have a good relationship with each other. The female pet will be pregnant for two to four days, and then has the kittens/puppies. Kittens and puppies in The Sims 2 can do things, and Sims can interact with them, unlike in Unleashed. Kittens and puppies cannot get jobs nor learn commands, but they can learn behaviors.The Sims 3: Pets  Pet pregnancy in The Sims 3 is mostly the same as in The Sims 2, with the exception of horses, as they are a new addition. Horses can breed in a box stall or be taken to the equestrian center and bred with a horse of the player's choosing. There is also a lifetime reward available for all cats and dogs that will increase the number of kittens or puppies that they have at once.The Sims 4: Cats and Dogs  Like previous games, pets can attempt to try for kittens or puppies. Sims will get moodlets depending on whether they succeeded\u00a0or not. If successful, a notification will appear.Other Player tips References Bella Goth  Bella Goth (\u00a0/\u02c8b\u025bl\u0259 \u0261\u0252\u03b8/) (n\u00e9e Bachelor) is one of the pre-made Sims shipped with The Sims game, in which she lives with her husband, Mortimer Goth, and her daughter, Cassandra Goth. Between The Sims and The Sims 2, Bella and Mortimer had one more child, Alexander Goth. She also had an elder brother named Michael Bachelor.Biography Life leading up to The Sims 3  In The Sims 3, Bella starts as a child (7 days to teen) who lives with her mother, Jocasta Bachelor, father, Simis Bachelor, and older brother, Michael Bachelor. Because she is still a child, she goes by her maiden name of Bachelor. She wears a red dress because this is her favorite color. Oddly, she has hazel eyes, even though she has brown eyes in The Sims and The Sims 2. When she grows up, she looks different from the adult versions of her from The Sims and The Sims 2; her lips are thinner and her eyes are much bigger. Bella and Mortimer Goth are best friends. Her traits are Good, Brave and Lucky. She attends Elementary School and is a good student. She is also slightly gothic, which is evidenced by her room and playroom being decorated with skulls, which may hint at why she married Mortimer, and also at her interest in the paranormal. She has one point of the painting skill. There is sometimes a glitch where her thumbnail, picture in relationship panels, and picture in wishes appear with her as a child, similar to Mortimer Goth. Bella has a good relationship with her family. She is said to be 'well-behaved' and the best dressed girl around. Worlds in The Sims 3 are believed to be on different timelines from each other, and it has since been confirmed by SimGuruSarah that the Bella Goth in Lunar Lakes graveyard is the same Bella from Pleasantview and Strangetown. Thus by the time of Lunar Lakes, Bella is dead. Her appearance (with her yellow hair, gaunt face and greenish skin) is very different in this town than in previous towns, but it is in line with other deceased Sims buried in the Lunar Lakes cemetery. How or when she got to Lunar Lakes remains unconfirmed, as is whether or not she ever reunited with her family after her alien abduction.Life leading up to The Sims Bustin' Out  In The Sims Bustin' Out, Bella Goth lives with her husband Mortimer Goth in Goth Manor. Her daughter Cassandra Goth may or may not have been born yet. She works as a Horror Movie Extra in the Movie Star Career and likes to play the piano and read when she's not working. Her favorite interactions are telling stories and nagging about friends. She has a completely different personality in this game than in the others.Life leading up to The Sims (console)  Bella Goth appears in The Sims (console) version with her husband Mortimer Goth and daughter Cassandra Goth living in 5 Sim Avenue. She still wears the same red dress and shoes, and has black hair. She shares a 90+ relationship with her husband and a 20+ relationship with her daughter. She likes to read, play chess, feed fish and mourn at the tombstones. Her brother Michael Bachelor is in the Family Bin as a playable character. However, their relationship is not stated, and Michael remains a separate character from her line of the family.Life leading up to The Sims  Bella Goth, her husband, Mortimer Goth, and her daughter, Cassandra Goth, are first introduced in The Sims. She is an elegant, yet athletic, woman who seems to enjoy playing golf. Her activities when played will either be painting or playing the piano, which gives credibility to the theory that she may also be a very creative and talented person. She also has quite a high interest in the paranormal.Life leading up to The Sims 2  By the time the storyline has caught up to The Sims 2, Bella has had another child, Alexander Goth, and has disappeared via\u00a0alien abduction. It is then revealed that Bella is Michael Bachelor's sister. She does exist in Pleasantview, but is hidden within the game code and can only be found using cheats or third-party programs. Bella's disappearance is a major component to the background story of Pleasantview and it's theorized that Maxis picked her for this major role because she is a mysterious, yet elegant, woman. Her last known whereabouts are Don Lothario's deck, and Don's photo album and memory panel show that he had attempted some romantic interactions with Bella, which she didn't accept, before she mysteriously disappeared. Many of Mortimer's, Cassandra's, and Alexander's memories involve Bella, meaning that she hasn't been gone for too long. On the family tree panel, Bella's face is not grey, which indicates that the game does not consider her to be dead. Although her husband and daughter have memories of her being abducted by aliens, the story does not explicitly state what happened to Bella. Oddly enough, most of the furniture was left untouched after she left. If a Sim uses the fingerprint scanner, much of the furniture was touched by her. Maxis created a likeness of Bella and used it as a townie in Strangetown. This version is a little different than the Pleasantview Bella, but is acknowledged by Maxis as the same Bella. The fact that the Bella in Strangetown has no memories of her loved ones or past life is simply blamed on alien experiments during her abduction. Strangetown Bella's career is randomized at the start of the game, whereas the Pleasantview Bella, if brought back, has no personality points, career and no premade memories, and she cannot be played without the use of hacks such as SimPE. Another odd detail is that, if Bella is brought back, Mortimer's relationship with her will be that of acquaintances rather than spouses. The reason for this is because the developers did not set the correct relationship flags. Some players prefer to play the Bella Goth in Strangetown and consider her to be the real Bella because she has no connection to Pleasantview and is not tied to the Goth and Bachelor family trees, which lends credence to the theory that the alien experiments left her mind wiped. A further area worth looking into is the cinematic when Alexander Goth goes off to university. If Mortimer is already deceased, the scene that the player sees before they enter the university features a regular Bella as Alexander's mother and she is sobbing about the loss of her son as he is grown up, but still remains missing afterwards. On\u00a0The Sims 2 website, there is an interview that explains her disappearance, saying that she is the same person as Strangetown Bella Goth. Another odd fact is that she is seen looking through a small telescope on Don Lothario's deck, even though it is impossible to get abducted through this telescope in normal gameplay. This might be a mistake overlooked by the creators to show good story-telling pictures for the neighborhood.Life leading up to The Sims 2 (PSP)  By the time the storyline has caught up to the PSP game, Bella is hiding from aliens in Strangetown. She still doesn't remember her family and likes chocolate. According to Mambo Loa, Bella is not good at keeping secrets. She is looking to sell her home (the Espiritu Estate) which she despises a lot because it is haunted by three scary ghosts (Emily Emory, Nervous Subject, and Dennis Philips, one of Hazel Dente's previous husbands). She sells her home for all the money that the player has. Bella's secrets from The Sims 2 (PSP):Life leading up to The Sims Social  Bella first appeared in a short interview promotion for the Facebook app The Sims Social. The interview confirms her abduction from The Sims 2. 'Ask the developer' thread in The Sims Social forum also stated it. Bella had in fact mysteriously reappeared in Littlehaven, a new city where Bella lived, set after The Sims 2 and Strangetown events, and it was her helpful neighbor Buddy who had found her. It appeared she had absolutely no memory of what had happened to her since the night of her abduction\u2014a whole chunk of her life was missing! As friends and family told her of how she had disappeared, Bella was determined to get answers and set off in search of the UFOs\u2014and her memories. She was good at it, too! Bella uncovered and met many an alien, mastering detective skills that Foxy Boulder would have been proud of. But alas, though she had successfully interviewed many aliens, they were not the ones who had abducted her. Each visitor pointed to another, and Bella followed the leads for many months. Eventually, after becoming exhausted following rumors and gossip, she settled for hypnotherapy in order to rediscover the hidden mysteries of her mind. Apart from uncovering numerous past life experiences, Bella did manage to recover her memories of the abduction! Pleased with the success of the therapy, she diligently wrote down in her journal for safekeeping\u2014should she be abducted again and be made forget! She plans to publish her notes someday, though she hasn't announced any dates. Bella may secretly hope to meet her UFOs acquaintances someday, but has since made peace with the fact that she's made lots of new friends in Littlehaven. She likes Chinese food (especially sweet and sour), would like to be a Fashion Buyer or a Mystery Customer for luxury spa resorts, and would like to visit The Eiffel Tower and The Taj Mahal. Her personality is socialite, and her career is chef. In the game, she is the tutorial Sim and the first neighbor the players' Sim meets. She is single and lives alone. She wears her signature red dress, red shoes, long black hair and has tan skin. The limit relationship with Bella is friendship; the player cannot become good friends or best friends with her nor fall in love or go steady with her. However, the player can perform romantic interactions with her.Life leading up to The Sims Mobile  In The Sims Mobile, Bella appears in this game to help the player to perform various tasks as part of the tutorial. It is possible to build a relationship with her.Life leading up to The Sims 4  Prior to the game's release, Bella appeared in a number of promotional materials, beginning with an Easter Egg in the first official trailer. She and Mortimer were later included as renders and in The Sims 4: Create A Sim Official Gameplay trailer, looking slightly different than in the final release. In the game, Bella lives in Willow Creek in the Ophelia Villa with her husband, Mortimer, and their two children, Cassandra and Alexander. This version of Bella Goth has been officially confirmed as existing in an alternate timeline to those seen in previous installments of the series. The Sims 4 version of Bella is a young adult, 24 days away from becoming an adult. She has the Party Animal aspiration and works in the Secret Agent career as an Intelligence Researcher, and has two skill points each in charisma, fitness, and programming. She is friends with her daughter and son, and sweethearts with Mortimer. She has no relationships outside of her household when first played. In the trailer, Bella is shown to have three traits, which are romantic, outgoing, and active. She's also shown to have an aspiration of Friend to the World, and a gregarious benefit. This version of her can be downloaded from the gallery, by SimGuruJill. The in-game version of her, however, has slightly different traits and aspiration: She is good, family-oriented and romantic, and has the Party Animal aspiration, but still has the gregarious benefit.Reuniting the Goths  A few people around the Internet have suggested many ways in order to get the Pleasantview Bella back. One way is to use the boolProp testingcheatsenabled and spawn the Tombstone of Life and Death to add Bella to the Goth family. Another is to use the inSimenator to summon Bella, improve her relationship to Mortimer, and set her as his spouse and resurrect her. However, she has the I Am Dead Token which will cause her to die. This can be removed using SimPE. When using boolProp testingcheatsenabled, Bella will be fine on the lot, but if the player leaves the lot and then return, the game will show her as having a ghost texture. The player will be able to control her for around a minute and then she will disappear. After this, a message will appear saying 'Bella has died on another lot.' Befriending the Bella Goth in Strangetown and moving her into a lot and then making her find her own place is a way to play Bella Goth, but only in Strangetown. Moving the lot to the Lots and Houses bin and then moving her into Pleasantview will cause problems in both neighborhoods.In other games  Her Bustin' Out biography states: Her name in Italian means \"beautiful\" and it fits her better than her red leather corset. Descended from a long line of occultists, mystics and decadents, she has thrown convention to the wind. Her disdain for the pedestrian and normal is only matched by her sense of ennui and isolation. She distracts herself from this world with a little organ practice and exotic gardenings of the lethal variety. Bella Goth is perhaps one of the most well known Sims. She appeared in The Sims Bustin' Out along with her husband Mortimer, she was in the TV family in The Sims 2 for Game Boy Advance, she appeared in The Sims 2 for PlayStation Portable, and she appeared in SimCity 4. According to her quotes in SimGolf (which she made an appearance as the download-able golfer, along with her family), she is very nice, an excellent neighbor, a little vain, compares bad things to Mortimer's foul moods and compares her family members to her shots (such as a Bella shot is too easy, a Mortimer shot is too difficult, and a Cassandra shot is impossible). She was also regularly featured on the cover for The Sims and its expansions.Easter eggs  There are many Easter eggs involving Bella Goth. Here is a list so far:The Sims The Sims 2 The Sims 3 The Sims 4 Trivia San Myshuno Reviews See also Ghost  Ghosts are featured in most The Sims games after Sims die. Some lots will have pre-made ghosts, and after Sims die, they linger as ghosts. Ghosts appear as transparent color-varied Sims.The Sims  Ghosts appear on residential lots that have the remains of a deceased Sim in a form of either an urn or tombstone. They can appear at any time between 12:00 am and daybreak but they don't always appear. When they appear, eerie music will play indicating their presence. They will usually hang around for a few hours doing nothing but just walking around while making windy noises. They take on the same appearance that they had when they died, except that they appear to be pale green-blue and transparent. Although playable Sims cannot interact with them, ghosts can \"Spook\" living Sims. When this happens, the ghost will sneak up on the Sim and vanish and then jump up behind the Sim while moaning and laugh. This causes the Sim to scream frantically and then run away, while some of his or her needs will be depleted. This \"Be Spooked\" interaction can be canceled. It will not override what is in the Sim's action queue, so it can be canceled before the Sim is spooked. One premade lot where Sims can see ghosts is the cemetery of the Goth family, which has the ghosts of dead relatives, i.e. Boy, Bratty, Uncle, Auntie, Grandma, Grandpa, Cousin, and Vegas. In Makin' Magic, magical Sims can make the Shed Your Skin charm. When it's used at night, the Sim who used it will be transformed into a green, ghost-like figure and will be able to talk to ghosts, as well as walk through walls and objects. Also, drinking Magic Nectar (x2 Grapes, x1 Fairy Dust) has the same effect as Shed Your Skin - but can be used during the day, as well.The Sims 2  There is a different type of ghost for each type of death in The Sims 2. Each has their own color and many have special abilities. All ghosts can scare living Sims - sometimes even to death - by showing themselves. Seeing a ghost is a common want for Knowledge Sims, and they will get a positive memory when they see one. Other Sims will get a negative memory. Sims may also have wants to \"See the Ghost\" of Sims they are enemies with or furious at. All ghosts can interact with some objects, for example: making a chair float or a teddy bear's head spin. Sims do not seem to notice or react to ghosts unless one chooses to make its presence known. The environment need of a Sim who goes outside at night while more than one ghost is out haunting will drastically fall down into the red zone.Abilities Angry spirits  A ghost can become angry if: Although all ghosts interact with objects and scare Sims, angry ghosts do so more violently. Normally, a ghost will only scare a Sim if they're close enough. Angry ghost will have wider range to scare Sims. An angry ghost may do things such as:When to expect them  Ghosts often appear just after 8:00\u00a0p.m. (20:00), but they sometimes appear later in the night, closer to midnight. Ghosts disappear at or around 6:00 am. They're never seen in the daytime or within the hour before or past light (with one possible exception). More than one angry ghost can appear at night, but it's more common to only see one. When there are only a few ghosts, they tend to appear around every three nights. When there are more than five though, they may appear every night. When a tombstone is on the lot, eerie background music may play if a Sim is outside. When a ghost is out, the music will be percussionary, and will play at intervals or whenever a ghost jumps into something. The exception to the daytime rule is if a grave is struck by lightning. A blue rod can strike a gravestone, resulting in a ghost appearing during daytime hours. They will float around the house for a much shorter period than they would during the night before returning to their grave.Keeping ghosts at bay  The easiest way to keep ghosts quiet is to move their graves to a cemetery. When there, several anger triggers won't work; however, a starving ghost will still be unhappy if there is no fridge. Mourning a grave will keep the ghost quiet for the time being, and building a moat around the grave site will stop them from invading the Sim's home, as they can't cross water. If Testingcheatsenabled is on and there is a ghost wandering around, the player can pause the game and make the ghost selectable, then just cancel the \"Haunt\" action and quickly make the ghost unselectable again. The ghost will then disappear. It is also possible to ForceError them, as this acts like canceling the action.Types of ghosts  Certain types of death don't have unique ghost color. Instead, their color will be similar to Sims who die of starvation, but their behavior might differ. The ghosts include the death by sunlight, coffin scare, and murphy bed. The wishing well ghost will be similar to ghosts of old age. Ghosts who were struck by lightning will be similar to ghosts of electrocution. The Running with Scissors Playset ghost will be similar to death by fright.Trivia The Sims: Bustin' Out (PS2/GameCube/XBOX)  In The Sims: Bustin' Out, ghosts work mostly the same as they do in The Sims for PC. The ghosts of dead Sims will appear at night and haunt the living Sims and scare them, and \"scary\" music will also play when ghosts appear on a lot. Only one lot, Goth Manor, has pre-made ghosts. The ghosts on that lot can be exorcised by using the Seance Table.The Sims 2 (console)  In the console versions of The Sims 2, all dead Sims become ghosts that the player can fully control. Ghosts will be able to perform different social interactions with living Sims, including the ability to possess and scare them. Their needs will be static in the middle. All ghosts look the same regardless of how the Sim died. Unlike most Sims games, ghosts will appear at all times of day. Ghosts can also be revived by winning a fiddle challenge with the Grim Reaper or giving him \u00a7100. Dead Sims are never really lost forever (or at least for a long time) as they are in the PC version.The Sims 2 (DS)  Although Sims cannot fully die in the Nintendo DS version The Sims 2, there is one ghost that will haunt the hotel. When the Cute Ghost painting is placed in the hotel, Sims may start receiving phone calls and text messages from the guests and concierge complaining about the hotel being haunted. The players may find the cute cartoonish looking ghost (who dons the original look of a ghost opposed to looking like a Sim) floating around Strangetown, he appears mostly in the lobby. He attempts to scare guests but can be temporarily removed via vacuum cleaner; he will return as long as the painting remains in the hotel. Due to the ghost not looking like a Sim it is unknown who he actually is, guests will just refer to him as 'Ghost'. He makes child like noises, so could be a child. The Concierge will ring the player saying the ghost visited and started crying. The player will never see the ghost cry, so he may be a relative of the player's Sim as he also appears to help them with social interactions.The Sims 3  Ghosts also appear in The Sims 3, and are fairly similar to those in The Sims 2. They also appear in different colors depending on how they died, but are much richer in color and appear to have higher visual fidelity than those in The Sims 2. There are premade ghosts in each graveyard and also in some houses that ship with The Sims 3 and each of its expansions. Unlike in previous games, ghosts are treated like normal Sims and can be interacted with as soon as they appear on the lot by simply clicking on them. They can also be turned into playable characters and can do all of the things normal Sims can do. They are the only life state other than normal Sims in The Sims 3 base game. The ghost state can be combined with all other life states. They are also seen briefly right after a Sim dies as the Grim Reaper comes to reap the ghost Sim from their mortal body. This also makes it possible for a Sim to fulfill a wish to see a ghost just after another Sim dies. When talking to a ghost, they sound like a normal Sim with a little echo. Prior to patch 1.26, they will make weird sounds such as screaming or shrieking. Ghosts move by floating instead of walking. They can become invisible, as well as possessing and haunting furniture. Ghosts, including playable ones, have free will actions which tell them to scare other Sims, but they do not do this all the time, and scaring Sims cannot cause death. The most ghosts could do is make a cowardly Sim faint. As of patch 1.6, ghosts float rather than stand (but do walk up and down stairs), and autonomously go through objects, walls and even other Sims. When a Sim's spouse dies (of any cause except for old age), it will still show the Sim as being in a relationship with their deceased partner. Therefore, if the ghost finds their living spouse (who will be shown as a fianc\u00e9e instead) doing any strong romantic action with their new partner, the ghost will be angry, as he or she will think of it as cheating. If a Sim goes around town and performs romantic interactions with their new romantic interest, girl/boyfriend, fianc\u00e9e, or spouse, he or she may get the cheater reputation. The player can stop this by having the surviving partner break up with the ghost when he or she is haunting. However, angry ghosts can be quite violent, so it would be smart to either put the grave in the graveyard, sell it, place it in a Sim's inventory, or hire a ghost exterminator. Another unique thing about ghosts in The Sims 3 is that they can also go outside of the graveyard to go to other lots and haunt other Sims, but they will only target homes that are somehow related to them. If taken notice of at the graveyard when they are already floating around, some ghosts will seen going out to the entrance and driving away in cars (either a Sloppy Jalopy or Big Lemon). However, the cars will look perfectly normal, not like ghost cars. Note that, when a ghost goes back to its grave, the relationships will reset to zero. Therefore, it is useless trying to have a Sim become friends with a ghost unless the ghost's urn or tombstone is placed in the Sim's inventory and taken into his or her house. Sometimes, when using the cheat ResetSim [InsertNameHere] on a ghost, the ghost may return to the Netherworld.Types of ghosts  As in The Sims 2, ghosts have different colors depending on how the Sim died, but their appearance is rather different. They have blank eyes, which is their most notable feature. Different ghosts may behave a little differently depending on their traits when they were alive and how they died.Playable ghosts  Ghosts can be resurrected to become playable using the Oh My Ghost! opportunity. The player can get this opportunity 2\u20133 days after the Sim dies. They can get married and have babies, including ghost babies. As a playable character, the ghost will be added to the household, like a family member. They can then be resurrected as normal Sims if they are fed with Ambrosia. Ghosts who have lost their gravestones cannot be resurrected. In The Sims 3 for console, a ghost can be brought back to life by using the Divine Intervention Karma Power. If a Sim in the player's household dies, that Sim will be playable as a ghost for 5 days. After which the ghost returns to the Netherworld and is never seen again. There are multiple ways to revive a ghost. If Sim has a death flower in their inventory when they die, Grim Reaper will take the flower and bring the Sim back to life. If The Sims 3: Ambitions is installed, ghost traveling to the past in time machine has a chance to be revived. Sims can also wish Genie to resurrect a Sim. Ghost Sims carry their own tombstones in their inventory which cannot be removed. If the player no longer wishes for the ghost to be around, the ghost can be dismissed by simply clicking on it and selecting the \"Return to the Netherworld\" option. This will revert the ghost to its remains, which will then need to be reburied or turned into an urn. Ghosts act in many ways similar to normal Sims. They eat food, clean messes, and sleep. Ghost children even go to school, even though they are dead. A child's grade always starts at C, no matter how high the grade was before death. If the Generations expansion pack is installed, a Sim who is good with the chemistry set or has a Ghost Potion in their inventory can turn into a ghost for three hours. While under the effects of the Ghost Potion, the Sim has the appearance of a ghost who died of old age and has all of the abilities of a true ghost; however, as they are not actually dead they do not have an urn in their inventory and therefore cannot use the \"Return to the Netherworld\" interaction. The console version of The Sim 3 Pets will have a karma power named \"Ghostify\" which will turn a Sim to a ghost and can be upgraded to choose a type of ghost. If the Supernatural expansion is installed, playable ghosts can be created in Create a Sim, and their type of death can be chosen. Deaths from other expansions can also be chosen even though the player doesn't have the corresponding expansions installed. (This is because the codes for expansion-ghosts types are carried forward through the different patches for The Sims 3. In order to kill Sims to get these types of ghosts, however, still require their corresponding expansions.) Playable ghosts of pre-existing Sims (as well as ghost pets and Plumbot ghosts) can also be added to a household by using the Philosopher's Stone. At the initial release of The Sims 3, ghosts were unable to become partners in or buy out businesses. However, in fully-updated games, ghosts can now purchase properties (including businesses) by using the \"Check Real Estate\" interaction on their cell phone.Related opportunities and wishes  Sims with the Gold Digger lifetime wish want more than anything to see the ghost of their rich spouse. This can be easily achieved by marrying a young adult Sim to a wealthy elder.Ghost glitches  In The Sims 3, a glitch might occur; when a ghost is haunting the lot, they may continue to haunt the lot forever and never return to their graves. In order to send the ghost back to its grave, the player must activate \"Testingcheatsenabled\", hold down shift and left-click on the ghost. The player will see an option titled Force Object; if it is selected, an option titled \"Delete it\" will become available. Select this and the ghost will disappear, as if it never came out to haunt the lot in the first place. This cheat is mostly harmless and can be used to send a ghost back to their grave if this glitch occurs. Another way is to send the ghost back to its grave is to use the ResetSim cheat (ctrl+shift+c, then type \"ResetSim (first name) (surname)\"). Type the name of the ghost into the ResetSim (without the brackets) and they will go back into their urns or graves. Another bug in the game causes ghosts on community lots to leave the lot and drive to a random unoccupied lot instead. The ghost will move onto the unoccupied space and then vanish. If the player attempts to interact with the ghost or clicks any interaction on it the ghost will disappear. Because of this bug, ghosts will no longer haunt the lot even if they are in a graveyard. This will also happen on unselected households. Prior to Patch 3, it was common for ghosts to lose their gravestone if the player switched families. That meant it could not be resurrected nor could it die. If a ghost is asked to move in and join the active household, the urn or grave for that ghost can be deleted; however, the sparkles on the ghost that died of old age will be lost. If the ghost eats ambrosia, it cannot be brought back to life. Deleting its urn or grave will also cause the ghost state to be permanent.The Sims 3 (DS)  Ghosts in The Sims 3 for Nintendo DS look much like regular Sims, but their features are grayed out slightly, and they are transparent. They don't 'walk', so much as they 'float', by lifting their legs up and moving. They cannot drive cars. They also appear prone to glitches, including getting stuck in the ground, and appear more frequently at night. They can be talked to, angered, and even flirted with, but a ghost has the extra ability to scare other Sims. They can go through walls, and when they move, ghostly Simlish can be heard. It is known that when normal Sims (especially Sims with the coward trait) try to interact with ghosts, their hair turns white, and the normal Sim runs away. when this happens, the ghost that the normal Sim ran away from will usually reenact the normal Sim's fright. Most normal Sims will run to the stoplight beside the road outside the graveyard, scream, and faint; ghosts will run there (or float), and will do what the Sims did. They will scream, fan themselves if it is a female Sim/ghost, and faint, but instead of being transported to the hospital after fainting like normal Sims, they will get back up and float to back to the graveyard. This could be a sign that ghosts are offended when normal Sims get scared of them. The 3 ghost characters are Sarah Abreu, Abrams Daigle, and Star Vega. Obviously, all three start out unemployed. None have lifetime wishes, but the players can give them one through the Mid-Life Crisis lifetime happiness reward. Strangely, Abrams and Sarah both have the insane trait, while Star Vega has the kleptomaniac trait. All three of these characters can be found at Pleasant Rest Graveyard, usually only at night. One can play as a ghost by befriending them, inviting them over and convincing them to move in. When played, ghosts act much like regular Sims, and can pursue careers. They can last indefinitely without food, and do not need to use the bathroom or clean themselves. They do, however, have a fun need, sleep need, and social need. When they get a job, or have a Magic Moment, the ghost will appear alive. This can also be seen if one attempts to edit the appearance of a ghost. Ghosts are generally quite grumpy, and are hard to make friends with. Abrams will usually reject a proposal.The Sims 4  The Sims 4 did not originally contain ghosts. When Sims died, they were permanently unplayable. Ghosts were added to The Sims 4 via a game patch on October 1, 2014. As in The Sims 3, ghosts come back as non-playable Sims that haunt the area around their graves upon death. Developing a good relationship with them can allow Sims to ask them to join the household. Ghosts change to certain colors depending on their emotional state: Sims can interact with ghosts like they can with normal Sims. There is a friendly interaction for ghosts in which ghosts can pass through Sims. Sims can also \"Ask Them What Happened\" to figure out how they died. Ghosts can appear at any time of the day. Having ghosts in a household is the requirements for 2 achievements. Ghosts can possess objects and go through walls and objects, though the player can choose which objects to possess. Ghosts can also break and/or \"Ghostly Repair\" objects through this possession ability, which is useful for Sims with lower handiness skill. If Spooky Stuff is installed, ghosts can wear any carved pumpkins on their heads, which will provide them with a happy moodlet.Types of ghosts  The known ghost types and their respective attributes are:Abilities  Ghosts in The Sims 4 can manually access their abilities, unlike in previous instalments it was an autonomous interaction. All ghosts can do a variety of ghostly interactions but they can also get extra interactions or effects based on how they died.See also References WooHoo  WooHoo is an interaction used in The Sims series, starting from The Sims 2, as a euphemism for sexual intercourse. WooHoo interactions can be carried out between two Sims, regardless of gender, that have to be romantically interested in each other. During a WooHoo, firework effects will appear along with bouncy effects in The Sims 2, or heart effects in The Sims 3 and The Sims 4. WooHooing will boost the social and fun motives of both Sims. While Sims can WooHoo without trying for a baby, and without risk of pregnancy, the \"Try for Baby\" action is also considered a WooHoo. A WooHoo is a special event in a Sim's life in The Sims 2. If cinematics are enabled, there will be a comic animation involving the first time a Sim WooHooes with another. Sims will earn a memory of each Sim they WooHoo with. If The Sims 2: University is installed, they will also receive the very first WooHoo memory. Oddly, WooHoo in The Sims 2 does not affect the Sims' gender preference. Sims usually desire to do a public WooHoo. Doing a public WooHoo will grant a special memory for the engaging Sims or a special moodlet and stride. WooHooing in The Sims 4 will provide a moodlet that affects their emotions, and it's possible for them to experience a good or bad WooHoo. In The Sims 4, teens can \"Mess Around\" with each other, although they will be fully clothed when they emerge from the bed. There is no WooHoo in The Sims. Introduced in Livin' Large, Sims can \"play in bed\" as an allusion and a precursor to WooHoo. Sims can also \"play\" in the two-person hot tubs from The Sims: Hot Date and The Sims: Vacation. There is a magazine named \"WhooNoo\" in The Sims; it is possible that the name \"WooHoo\" is based on that.Woohoo locations  The WooHoo interaction is possible in these locations:The Sims The Sims 2  In The Sims 2, public WooHoo is a form of WooHoo that is done using the specific indicated objects on a community lot. Sims may have wants to have public WooHoo. Public WooHoo gives a specific memory, and other Sims on the lot will react to it.The Sims 3  As of The Sims 3: Late Night, the game recognizes a public WooHoo, which is done outside the Sim's home. When they do this, Sims will get the \"Stride of Pride\" moodlet and do a fancy walk. Doing a WooHoo inside a photo booth is considered a public WooHoo, even if it's done at home.The Sims 4  If Sims WooHoo in community lots, other Sims will come to spectate it. However, Sims will not gain any special moodlets from it.Try for baby  Alternatively, a male and female Sim can initiate the \"Try for Baby\" interaction to conceive a baby. In The Sims 2, the female Sim must be on her home lot or controllable on a community lot. In The Sims 3, the female Sim does not need to be on her home lot to try for a baby. Trying for a baby carries a chance of conception depending on where it was done. Additional chance of conception is increased by certain conditions, as following. In The Sims 2, \"Try for Baby\" is not possible for an adult female who is less than 5 days away from becoming an elder. Once an adult female is 5 days away from becoming an elder, she may still be able to \"Try for Baby\" until 11 a.m. the next day. In The Sims 2: University, \"Try for Baby\" is not possible for a young adult female. Young adults can try for a baby in The Sims 3 and The Sims 4, and young adult females are more fertile than adult females; i.e. there is a greater chance for twins and triplets to occur. In The Sims 3, if a Sim becomes pregnant directly before becoming an elder, then the process of aging is simply suspended until after the baby is born. If the lot already has 8 controllable Sims on it, the \"Try for Baby\" option will not appear. Zombies, mummies, Servos, and SimBots do not have the \"Try for Baby\" interaction. Without hacks or mods, only male/female couples can try for a baby. A male between the ages of young adult and elder can impregnate a female. Without cheats, male Sims can only be impregnated by aliens. This can occur if they \"Stargaze\" with the more expensive telescope at night, though it is very unlikely to happen. However, if FreeTime or later is installed, any Sim who has Knowledge as their primary aspiration, and who has enough lifetime aspiration points, can choose Summon aliens as an aspiration benefit. A Sim with this benefit can use any telescope to attempt to summon aliens, and will have a higher chance of being abducted. Therefore, an adult male Sim with this benefit can, more or less, try for an alien-hybrid baby. The \"Try for Baby\" option does not exist in The Sims Medieval. In The Sims Medieval, Woohoo between two Sims of the opposite gender always carries a chance of pregnancy.Jealousy  As WooHoo is considered to be a romantic interaction, Sims who witness their loved ones engaging in WooHoo with another Sim will always get jealous, resulting in a significant drop in relationship with both Sims. In The Sims 2, WooHoo will trigger jealousy if the witnessing Sim is on the same lot where the WooHoo is taking place, even if they are not in the same room.Gender and age compatibility  The following table shows the compatibility of various age groups and genders for WooHoo/baby interactions. Note: when referring to trying for a baby, the table only states the possibilities for the interaction. As with all other romantic interactions, blood relatives and teens and younger are automatically prevented from WooHooing although there are hacks that allow both groups to do this, with the exception of Sims younger than teen. In The Sims 4, teens are able to \"mess around\" with other teens, an implication of WooHoo. The differences are that teens will not get a WooHoo-specific moodlet and they will not change to sleepwear when they mess around on a bed, though on the stats section of the Simology menu, messing around counts towards the statistic for times Woohooed. Because of its wide-ranging implications, WooHoo is generally not an autonomous interaction. In The Sims 2, there is a mod called Autonomous Casual Romance, which can be found on Simbology. This allows Sims to WooHoo and even try for a baby on their own, though the player can still forbid the latter if they want. In The Sims 3: Generations, newly wed couples with the \"Just Married\" moodlet may autonomously push the \"Be Frisky\" interaction, which ends in WooHoo. Another mod on Simbology allows same-sex couples to try for a baby; the Sim that initiates the action will be considered the \"mother.\" In The Sims 4, Patch 34 adds a customization option in CAS which allows players to give Sims of either gender the ability to get pregnant, or to impregnate other Sims.Pets  Pets can WooHoo in order to breed (producing a litter of up to four puppies or kittens), but they require a Sim that has a good relationship with at least one of the pets to direct them, and the pets obviously must have a good relationship. The gestation period is approximately 72 game hours, just like Sims. If a pet has a poor relationship with the other pet, they will reject the interaction.Death  In The Sims 4, WooHoo between elders that does not go very well has a chance to give the \"Dangerously Tired\" moodlet. When the Sims WooHoo again with the moodlet, they will die from overexertion.See also Realistic skin  Various high-quality skin mod packages for male and female Sims have now been created by fans of the game. These can be easily installed in a non-destructive manner and easily uninstalled if it isn't the player's taste of game play. Tested skin mods include: As with the No Mosaic mod package that removes the mosaic-blur effect when showering or using the bathroom, it's a matter of personal taste whether some of these more realistic skin options (designated above by the R and M ratings) are lewd or simply realistic and natural. Remember that The Sims games are played in many nations throughout the world and many cultures are not bothered by casual nudity being portrayed in their media or games. For the adult players reading this article, this is a roadmap that enables The Sims players to safely and non-destructively mod their The Sims/The Sims 3 games to remove all censorship features such as barbie-doll skins, or alternatively to as to improve the visual quality of the barbie doll skins without adding realism that the player might personally find offensive.Steps to install the above-listed mod packages in order (The Sims) Steps to install the above-listed mod packages in order (The Sims 3) Death  Death is the permanent state of existence in which a previously living Sim, pet,\u00a0or other creature ceases to live. Causes of death range from natural causes (brought on by reaching the end of the elder life stage), accidents, player neglect, or through the deliberate player choice(s). In The Sims 2, a deceased Sim's closest friends and family members will inherit a small amount of money through life insurance. If a Sim is married or joined at the time of their death, any community lots or vacation homes owned are inherited by their spouse. In The Sims 4, no such monetary inheritance takes place, although items in a deceased Sim's inventory will be transferred to their offspring who live in the same lot. All Sims who witnessed the death, including those not particularly close to the deceased Sim, will receive a sad moodlet (though household members who were not in the same room as the deceased Sim at the time of death will not be affected). Sims who witnessed the death of an enemy will receive a happy moodlet. When all Sims die in a household, or there are only children in the household (as in the case of The Sims 2 and later games), a game over occurs. In The Sims 2, any orphaned babies, toddlers, or children will be taken away by an on-screen social worker, whereas in The Sims 4, a message indicating that the orphaned Sim(s) will be cared for by social services will appear. In addition, when all teen and older household members die, all businesses and restaurants owned will be released back to the community (even if the deceased Sim has a living offspring residing somewhere else) and their prospective owners can generally only buy them as unfurnished lots. Although death is typically a state of absolute finality, there are several ways in which the dead may still be interacted with or even brought back to life. The spirits of dead Sims are often left to roam the world as ghosts, and there exist several legitimate (i.e. in-game) and illegitimate (i.e. cheating) methods to revive ghosts.Grim Reaper\u00a0  The Sim that has died is visited by the anthropomorphic personification of death in the form of the Grim Reaper. However, the Grim Reaper does not come if a Sim dies in a Skydiving Simulator in The Sims: Superstar, if a Toadified Sim is eaten by a dragon in The Sims: Makin' Magic, and if a Sim is eaten by the Cowplant in The Sims 2: University. In The Sims 2 and The Sims 3, the Grim Reaper plays a cameo depending on the method of death and the aspiration level of the Sim in question. Unlike most legends of the Grim Reaper, he seems to be a kind being in The Sims series. His personality is perhaps a reference to the personified Death character in Terry Pratchett's \"Discworld\" novels. His nice side shows when a Sim with a full aspiration bar dies of old age, during the animation of a pet's death, or resurrecting kids with the Resurrect-O-Nomitron. In The Sims Livin' Large, The Sims 2, and The Sims 4, a living Sim who is on the lot can plead with the Grim Reaper, asking him not to take the newly deceased Sim. The chances of success are determined by the relationship of the pleading Sim with the newly deceased, and pure chance. In The Sims, the Grim Reaper may be in a bad mood, and bring the deceased Sim back as a zombie. In The Sims and The Sims 2, it is not possible to plead for a Sim who has died of old age. Also, it may not be possible to plead for a drowned Sim, as living Sims will not be able to get to the Grim Reaper if he is out in the water. However, if The Sims 2: Apartment Life is installed, an infallibly good witch or warlock with 9 or more magic skill can use the spell \"Expello Mortis\", which will reach further out, though it will not be able to reach the middle of a very large pool. Also, in The Sims 2: FreeTime, Sims who have summoned a genie and successfully wished for the power to cheat death can plead for their own lives even if they are in the middle of a pool or have died of old age. In The Sims 4, Sims cannot plead for the dead Sim's life before the actual reaping begins. In The Sims 2: Pets, the Grim Reaper plays a different animation for pets that die. In The Sims 3, Sims can beg for their own life depending on the how happy the Sim was when they died. Somewhat \"dramatic\" music will play while the Grim Reaper is about. The Grim Reaper will reap the soul, leave a tombstone or an urn and then leave, similar to past games.Reviving  Death, however, isn't always permanent. With a wide range of items and/or cheats, a Sim can be given a second chance at life.The Sims The Sims 2 The Sims 3  In The Sims 3, there is a special plant called a Death Flower. If a Sim is carrying this flower in their inventory at the time of their death, when the Grim Reaper shows up, the ghost will offer him the flower. Seemingly deeply moved by this gesture, the Grim Reaper will proceed to instantly resurrect the Sim. A Sim can be resurrected once for every Death Flower in their inventory. However, it seems that the Sim in question will suffer from any lowered motives, just to a lesser degree, so it is incredibly important to use this second chance to raise these motives before the Sim dies again.The Sims 4 Intentional death  Players can utilize various cheats, objects, or game features to intentionally kill a Sim. This may be done for multiple reasons. Ways include:Limitations  In The Sims 3, due to the way gravestones are spawned, Sims cannot die in areas outside of lots. For example, when a Sim starves while standing on a road, the Sim will not die. Prior to The Sims 2: Bon Voyage, Sims cannot die on a community lot. In the initial release of The Sims 4, Sims did not starve to death outside of their home neighborhood, but this limitation was removed in later updates. In The Sims Stories, the player's Sims do not die during the main storyline.Types of deaths  Sims can be killed in a variety of ways which vary by game version.

Get your Sims an all-access pass to the hottest spots in town. Whether they mingle with celebrities or enjoy a casual night with friends, your Sims\u2019 social lives are getting a boost!

Wherever your Sims go, they\u2019ll discover new things to become\u2014adored celebrities, all-night partiers, rowdy bandmates, or vampires. What will your Sims get up to after dark?Game Summary  The Sims 3 Late Night gives players all-access to and lets them loose on a vibrant, active downtown scene where they\u2019ll rub elbows with celebrities at the hottest parties, hit the local bar after work, tour the scene with their Sims\u2019 band, kick back in a plush hot tub, and discover what\u2019s lurking as the lights go out and adventure begins after dark. Players will be able to take their Sims into the bustling urban setting where they\u2019ll be able to become local celebrities, members of music bands, mixologists, directors, and more.

Whether embarking on a new career, painting the town red, or throwing a party on the rooftop of a penthouse, it\u2019s always up to the player to tell their unique stories with The Sims 3. What will happen when the lights go out and Sims get all access?Features Trivia Pre-Release  It was confirmed on July 20, 2010 at EA's Studio Showcase 2010. According to an official sneak peek at Late Night, it would offer players a more mature, realistic and urban environment when compared to earlier similar expansions.

The skill is augmented by the Green Thumb trait, and the Super Green Thumb lifetime reward. It involves (as with gardening in real life and the previous Sims games) the planting, growing and harvesting of various plants that Sims can find within the game. Unlike the previous Sims games, The Sims 3 gardening has been much expanded upon, introducing many real-life plants and several fictional species such as the 'Life Fruit', 'Flame Fruit', and 'Plasma Fruit'. Some expansion packs include more varieties of plant collections. Some of the plants can be used as ingredients for Nectar Making and Mixology, with the key ingredients for Nectar Making being the grapes from Champs Les Sims. With Ambitions, Sims can register as a self-employed Gardener. Gardening can be profitable by selling the harvested produce from the inventory, supermarket, or consignment store. Only teens and older can tend gardens. Children cannot learn the Gardening skill, but they can learn the Child Gardening hidden skill. Once a child grows up into a teenager, they will earn Gardening skills at the same level of their Child Gardening and Scouting hidden skills. Once a Sim has maximized their Gardening skill, they will receive a certificate in the mailbox a few days later, along with a notification saying: \"The Dillinger Diggers Guild congratulates you, [Sim name], for achieving the very highest level of excellence in bringing life forth from our fertile Earth. Please accept this handsomely framed certificate and display it with pride knowing others will see just how skilled you are.\"Statistics Challenges  A Master Planter must plant 19 types of plant that can be planted in the game. Once you have mastered the varieties you will be able to reduce weed growth significantly on future plants. Botanical Bosses must harvest at least 75 Perfect fruits and vegetables. After so many Perfect harvestables, the plants of Botanical Bosses almost never die from neglect. Master Farmers have harvested at least 650 fruits and vegetables. The plants of Master Farmers remain watered and fertilized longer, meaning their gardens are more efficient.Plants  Plants and seeds can be planted at home. Seeds can be found on the ground throughout the town or upon reaching level 1, while plants can be found from the supermarket, vegetable stand, or harvesting from wild plants. Several plants are exclusive to premium Store contents. These plants are only included by purchasing certain premium contents (which are usually part of a set or venue) and installing them to the game. The plants and the premium contents are as following:Notes Quality & varieties  Harvested produce has a quality ranging from horrifying, putrid, foul, bad, normal, nice, very nice, great, excellent, outstanding, and perfect. Higher quality produce is worth more for selling and will have increased strength as fertilizer. The quality of the harvested produce roughly corresponds to the quality of the plants. Thus, an excellent apple tree will usually bear excellent apples, however there is a chance of harvesting higher quality produce. Produce can be used for the following: Generally, plants are used for ingredients. Store plants are usually used to complement other premium contents: Additionally, produces can be used to create jams and preserves with Canning Station premium content. Some plants also have their own unique variety, which makes them have other usages aside from ingredients.Mushrooms  Mushrooms are plants that came from Supernatural. The common use of mushroom is for Alchemy ingredients. Some mushrooms are edible and can be used as a food ingredient, i.e. truffles, porcinis, and white caps; while the others are inedible. Collecting wild mushrooms is also part of the Collecting challenges. Collecting 7 of them will increase the quality of mushrooms grown. Harvested mushrooms don't count to the challenge.Herbs  Herbs are plants that came from University Life. Herbs are related to Rebel social group. Herbs can be used as an addition to meal or herbal drink, burned in bonfire or fireplace, or eaten raw, which will give a moodlet and various certain effects. The moodlet time is based on how the herb is consumed: 8 hours if eaten raw, 5 hours if added to meal, 3 hours from herbal drink, and 2 hours from being burned. There's a 15% chance the herb will cause herb nausea when consumed, which will increase or decrease based on the quality of the herb. Below is the list of herbs and its effects:Coffee beans  Coffee beans are plants that came from University Life. Coffee beans can be consumed raw or as coffee drink from the barista bar. Coffee beans cannot be used as any ingredients or for the espresso maker. Consuming coffee bean will give various moodlets, which work like \"Buzzed\" moodlet from drinking coffee, which will temporarily override \"Sleepy\", \"Tired\", and \"Exhausted\" moodlets, as well as getting \"Buzz Crashed\" when the effect expires. Below is the list of coffee beans:Crystal flowers  Crystal flowers are plants that came from Into the Future. The main use of crystal flowers is as ingredients to create trait chips for plumbots. A crystal flower has 5 types of emotional charges. The common emotional charge is neutral. Sims can charge a crystal flower so the emotional charge will turn into either kindness, laughter, love, or rage. After that, they must charge the flower regularly, or the emotional charge will lose its power and eventually turn back into neutral. Sims can also neutralize the flower to change the emotional charge to neutral instantly. When the flowers are harvested, Sims can harness the flower or imbue it to other Sims. When harnessed, the flower will grant a special moodlet to the user. Only non-neutral flowers can be harnessed.Money tree  Money tree is a special tree that has money bill leaves and grows money bags. Sims can harvest the money bags and exchange them for money. Sims can receive the seed from certain opportunities, fishing, analyzing an unknown special seed, and so on. If tended well, money trees will never die. However, should it be neglected too long and perish, it will explode and leave many bills behind.Special plants  The following plants have the rarity of special. Sims can plant these seeds after they've completed certain opportunities. Completing the Uncommonly Good opportunity will grant the ability to plant cheeses and eggs. Completing the Outstandingly Rare opportunity will grant the ability to plant steaks and patties. Completing The Omnificent Plant grants the ability to plant omni plant and order its seed from the mailbox. These opportunities can only be received in order, but not necessarily consecutively. This is because The Omnificent Plant requires Sims to plant outstanding steaks and Outstandingly Rare requires Sims to plant excellent cheeses. Omni plant is a special plant which can be used to replicate many things. The plant can be fed with items, and once the plant is on its harvest state, Sims can harvest whatever the plant was fed with. The following are items that can be fed to the omni plant: There are several things to consider about the items that can be fed to:Fertilizer  Fertilizer can be used to increase the plant speed growth. Fertilizer does not affect the quality of the plant or produce. Most ingredients can be used to fertilize plants, as well as horse fertilizer from the horse stall. Below is the list of fertilizers, the time the effect lasts, and the grade. Depending on the quality of the fertilizer, the value and length can be modified. The fertilizer value will be multiplied according to the multipliers, and the length will be added with extra days. Furthermore, completing the Master Farmer skill challenge will benefit Sims by giving additional 2 days for any fertilizers.Tips Notes External links The Sims 3: Pets  The Sims 3: Pets is the fifth expansion pack for The Sims 3. The game sees a return of pets from The Sims 2: Pets and The Sims: Unleashed. Cats and dogs have returned, along with a brand new animal: horses. There are also snakes, turtles, birds, rodents, lizards, deer, and raccoons in the PC/Mac version.Description  Bring excitement and surprise into your Sims' lives with pets!

With a variety of new activities and social interactions, take direct control of your Sims' pets and explore new ways to mess with their lives. Give your Sims a new member of their household and discover all-new ways to play with life!Game Features Pet traits  Traits are also featured for pets just like Sims. There are total of 30 pet traits. Each pet can have three traits. More traits can be \"trained\" by reinforcing certain behaviors. Some traits are unique to one species, and some can be for any species. There are also some traits that will conflict with one another, such as Agile and Hates to Jump.Pre-Release  A trailer was leaked at the same time as the The Sims 3: Generations one. An official trailer has since been released, announcing the game. As with other expansion packs, there was a 'hint' in the Generations expansion pack, being a paw print on the back of any baby/toddler magical gnomes.Trivia Music  In addition to licensed music, the expansion will feature an orchestral score. Unlike the base game and preceding expansion packs that were composed by Steve Jablonsky, the score for Pets is composed by Christopher Lennertz. The orchestral score is available as a download from the iTunes Store. This is a list of artists and their songs that are to be featured in Pets:See also External links The Sims 3/cheats  These cheats require The Sims 3. While in normal gameplay, press ++ to open the cheat console on Windows and Mac computers. Cheats are not case-sensitive. When capital letters are used in a cheat name, it's to make the name easier to read, not because they are required.Miscellaneous cheats Storytelling cheats Build cheats Gameplay cheats Advanced cheats Shift-clicks  on a particular object when testingCheatsEnabled is true will bring up a special debug pie menu. This pie menu isn't as extensive as it was in The Sims 2, but there are some useful cheats. The following are the objects and their top level cheats. Cheats with a \"...\" have more levels that may not be listed for brevity.Control-clicks  If testingcheatsenabled true is on, using  + click on any moodlet in the moodlet panel will eliminate it. If it is motive induced, the bar related to the negative moodlet will be filled completely, just like when it is subject to a \"Cure\" by the Moodlet Manager. Entering testingcheatsenabled true on the load/new game screen, enables  + click between the chest and the points in the lifetime happiness to add additional lifetime happiness of 500. (Note: The click works for all the mouse buttons, clicking all of them rapidly at the same time will make the lifetime happiness points increase faster.)Drag-clicks  When testingcheatsenabled true is activated, you can raise or lower your Sim's current motive by clicking on any motive and then dragging your mouse to the left or right. This function can be also used to raise or lower relationship on any Sims. You can also adjust your Sim's progress in any profession if Ambitions is installed. However you will only see the motives change if you are in an unpaused game. When paused you can still do this action, but it'll take effect only after you resumed the game.Fishing (The Sims 3)  Fishing is a skill in The Sims 3. This skill is gained by fishing in the ponds or ocean around the map. The higher the Sims' fishing skill is, the more types of fish they can catch. Books can be found at the bookstore showing the bait that can be used to catch specific fish, but a Sim can determine the bait through trial and error by simply selecting a bait and seeing what they catch. Water can be inspected to see what known fish can be caught there, and whether the fish are active. The skill is augmented by the angler and loves the outdoors traits. Children and older Sims with the childish or insane traits can fish in swimming pools. When Sims reach level 3 in the gardening skill, they can use fish as a fertilizer for harvestable plants in their garden. The quality of the fish depends on how effective the fertilizer will be on the plant it is used on. There are certain types of fish that can only be caught if Sims travel to one of the three locations shipped with The Sims 3: World Adventures. Sims can catch frogs, snails and crawfish in Champs Les Sims. In Shang Simla the types of fish Sims can catch are doitsu koi, kawarimono koi, ochiba koi, tancho koi and dragon fish. In Al Simhara, Sims can catch crocodiles and mummy fish. These fish are exclusive to these locations and cannot be caught in any other world shipped with The Sims 3. With The Sims 3: Ambitions expansion pack, players can register as a self-employed fisher.Statistics Abilities  Every two levels the game announces the Sim can catch more fish and to check the bookstore. The Sim can learn the bait type for a specific fish species by buying and reading fishing books from the bookstore or just by successfully catching a particular species once using the right bait type. Fishing books are not available in the community public library. All aquatic animals caught fishing can be kept as pets in an aquarium or they can be used to stock a pond.Fish Notes Trophies  Fish can be mounted on walls by clicking on a fish in a Sim's inventory and choosing \"send to be mounted\" and paying a small fee around 70 Simoleons. The trophy should arrive the next day in the mailbox. Fish can also be put in fish bowls or an aquarium. Fish bowls can be bought in buy mode. All fish fit in a bowl, one fish per bowl or six fish per tank. Fish are nameable, but must be fed each day or they will die. Fish can be scooped out of bowls, and put back in a Sim's inventory.Stocking ponds  If a Sim has 10 or more fish of one type in their inventory, they can stock any pond with that fish. By stocking fish, a new type of fish is introduced in that pond. The pond will then contain an unlimited supply of that fish type for fishing. There is no limit on how many different fish types there can be in one pond. Any type of fish or any type of pond will do, including Deathfish and ponds not on playable lots. Stocking a pond with the Deathfish (or any other fish, for that matter) will allow it to be caught at any time of the day in that pond. A tip in obtaining better Death Fish is purchasing 10 Alley Catfish and stocking them in a pond in order to obtain a perfect Alley Catfish. Then fish 10 Angel Fish and stock them in the same pond. At midnight to 5am the angler will be able to get a very good or perfect Deathfish.Buydebug fishing spawners  Fishing spots can be populated with fish by using fishing spawners. Fishing spawners can be found under the buy menu when the cheat buydebug is turned on. Here is a list of fish in the game, by fishing spawner:Strange occurrences  Sometimes a Sim may bring up an old box which will give them various things. The box randomly grants the Sim one object from the following list, sorted according to the rarity of the item:Riverview  Official item\n Store itemRiverview is a free downloadable town offered from The Sims 3 store. The town was developed by Visceral Games, and is a gift for people who register their copy of The Sims 3. It was the first town made available for download, and is currently the only free downloadable town. It initially served as an incentive for players to purchase, rather than pirate, their copy of The Sims 3, as pirated versions are unable to download Riverview from TheSims3.com.Overview  Like Sunset Valley, Riverview is very large compared to previous games, although it is a small town with an idyllic countryside setting. It\u2019s dotted with farms, beautiful pastures, and nestled by a winding river, known, according the world's flavor text, as the Simomon. There are 95 lots altogether, three fewer than in Sunset Valley. The center of town is built up on an island in the middle of the Simomon. The street name where Constance Shelley and Meadow Carpenter-Rhodes live suggests that the island name is Long Island. On one of the shores of the river, there is an industrial area featuring several rabbit holes. The landscape is primarily flat, with one notable hill upon which stands Remington's Ruse, the Remington family home. The architectural style is primarily small rustic town, with a few industrial-style lots in the industrial area that contains the military base, hospital, and abandoned warehouse. Despite the small town style, there is a lot of diversity in the townscape, with farms, poor and wealthy subdivisions, and forested terrain. There are 50 new playable Sims in total. There are 22 empty residential lots for players to get started on, or they can choose any of the pre-made families. The cheapest of the lots is \u00a71200, and the most expensive is \u00a714,700. The smallest available lot is 20x30, and the largest is 64x64. The most expensive lot will put players in the company of Lessen, Shallows, Wilson, and Grisbys. There are a few old faces from The Sims 2 in Riverview, just as in Sunset Valley.Lots Community lots Families New Families Returning Families  Although not in any previous games, Riverview does feature several families that are implied to have moved to Pleasantview by the time of The Sims or The Sims 2.Homeless Sims  These Sims are pre-made, but homeless when Riverview is first loaded.Trivia Trait (The Sims 3)  Traits are the building blocks of a personality assigned to Sims in The Sims 3, replacing the previous system of personality points. The traits also appear in The Sims Medieval; this time, traits are adapted to the Medieval period. They determine a Sim's behaviors, abilities, and their wishes, including their Lifetime Wishes. There are 63 traits in the base game. Three traits were added with World Adventures, six with Ambitions, one with Fast Lane Stuff, two with Late Night, two with Generations, four with Pets, three with Showtime, six with Supernatural, two with Seasons, three with University Life, two with Island Paradise, and two with Into the Future. Altogether they add up to a total of 99 normal traits. Each trait is separated into one of four categories based on mental, physical, social, or lifestyle aspects of Sims' lives. For example, social traits may include dislikes children or friendly, while lifestyle traits would consist of technophobe or daredevil. Traits are used to allow Sims a greater complexity in their daily routines over the points system. The more traits a Sim has, the more complex they will be, as a Sim with more personality traits will exhibit a wider range of behaviors than a Sim with only one. Sims can attain traits in multiple ways. Ordinarily the player will assign a maximum of five traits to a young adult or older Sim in the Create a Sim screen under the \"Personality\" section. Traits can also be inherited via genetics from either parent, with babies and toddlers having two traits. If the toddler grows up well, the player will be able to choose a third trait for when the Sim becomes a child, and likewise a fourth when the Sim becomes a teen and finally a fifth trait when the Sim becomes a young adult. Furthermore, the lifetime reward \"Midlife Crisis\" allows the player to re-choose a Sim's traits. There are limitations on the traits a Sim can have. Foremost, two traits may not contradict each other, such as the good and evil traits, or the can't stand art and artistic traits. Such traits are inherently built around opposing behaviors and intrinsically preclude the occurrence of the other. In addition, Sims may be unable to obtain traits based on their age; one example being that babies are unable to have the charismatic trait or that only teens and older Sims can have the hopeless romantic trait. Traits also grant Sims different abilities or specific actions which only Sims having those traits can do. Insane Sims are able to use the command \"Talk to Self\" to boost their own social motive, while vegetarian Sims are able to cook vegetarian alternatives to meals containing meat (though in Showtime, all Sims are able to cook these meals, regardless of traits). Some traits can grant Sims special moodlets, with loner Sims enjoying their solitude or hydrophobic Sims fearing swimming in the pool. Other traits allow Sims a greater affinity for certain tasks, such as angler Sims being more adept at fishing while genius Sims tend to learn more quickly. In this respect, the customization that players can give to Sims via the trait system can make the game more or less challenging while offering a greater deal of variety than was possible with the personality point system used in the game's predecessors. Features comparable to traits in previous games in the series are Zodiac signs, interests, and personality.Learning traits  As Sims socialize with others, they may reveal their traits from certain interactions. For example, asking a Sim's career will reveal if they have workaholic or ambitious traits, or flirting with a Sim will reveal flirty or unflirty trait. Learning traits can be beneficial to Sims. If the Sim has the same trait as the other Sim, they will get a compatibility trait as well as a relationship boost. On the other hand, if they have any conflicting traits, they will get a negative relationship. Learning traits is very important for Architectural Designer profession. Learning a client's traits is important in order to satisfy their desired objects, such as placing bars for party animal clients, which will boost the scores. Aside from socializing, Sims can easily learn other Sims' traits from several methods:Hidden traits  Hidden traits are traits in The Sims 3 that cannot be seen in-game except when a Sim performs a related action autonomously or an unlocked interaction is available. Hidden traits become available to Sims in specific careers, life states, or to babies with an NPC for a parent. The child might then get the appropriate hidden traitAdditional traits  This section describes features that are only available in The Sims 3: University Life. Sims are born with two traits, and gain an additional trait on aging up from toddler to child, from child to teen, and from teen to young adult. Therefore, a fully-grown Sim has five traits. With University Life, it is possible to earn two additional traits, for a total of seven traits. The trait panel will still show only five traits, but when a Sim has more than five, a scroll bar will appear next to the traits. The two additional traits are earned by: Sims cannot earn the extra trait slots multiple times, for example, by reaching level 8 in all social groups or completing multiple majors. If the requirement to earn an additional trait slot is completed more than once, a prompt will appear that will allow reconfirmation or replacement of the additional trait.Removed traits  There are a number of traits that were removed before the game was released. Some of them might be removed because they share similar purpose with an existing trait, or might raise the ESRB rating, while some others were removed unexplained. Some removed traits have their own icons in the game files, while some are only mentioned in the old game strings.External links Premade families  Premade families and households.The Sims 3: Showtime  The Sims 3: Showtime is the sixth expansion pack for The Sims 3.

The Sims 2 was first released on September 14, 2004. The Sims 2 heralds sweeping changes from the original. The isometric view of The Sims is replaced by a full 3D environment. Sims experience life stages (baby, toddler, child, teen, young adult, adult, and elder) which have them age from birth to death, and their genetics can be passed on to their children. Unlike the original The Sims, where the player can spend forever raising a Sim's skills, the aging system in The Sims 2 imposes a time limit on this before the Sims die. Sims' personalities are given an overhaul, with each Sim having an aspiration, wants, and fears. The Sims 2, like its predecessor and successor games, is open-ended with few goals. Players can build and furnish homes for their Sims, in order to fulfill the Sims' motives. They can choose to focus on building their Sims' relationships and skills in order to advance through their careers or start a family. They can also focus on achieving a Sim's aspiration through the completion of wants and avoidance of fears. The Sims 2 shipped with 3 pre-made neighborhoods; Pleasantview, which is a continuation of the original The Sims storyline 25 years later; Strangetown, a desert landscape with paranormal occurrences; and Veronaville, a neighborhood based on several plays by William Shakespeare. The Sims 2 also shipped with many pre-made Sims and families, including some Sims and families that first appeared in The Sims. The Sims 2 has sold over 6 million PC copies since its release (13 million across all platforms), making it one of the best-selling PC games of all time.New Gameplay Options  The Sims 2 adds several new gameplay options that help expand the creation of Sims and the building of a neighborhood! These include:Tutorial  Players can take a tutorial that is a residential lot separate from gameplay. There are also in-game tutorials present in each of the pre-made lots to help players learn certain aspects of gameplay. This will help players become pros at this game faster, and give them a chance to know what to do when a certain problem or event comes up. However, families in the family bin tend not to have any teaching objective.Personalities  Personalities are not only based on the astrological sign of the Sim but also on the aspiration of the Sim. Aspirations along with the astrological sign of the Sim creates a variety of wants and fears. Each Sim has 5 areas of personality: Sloppy/Neat, Shy/Outgoing, Lazy/Active, Mean/Nice, and Serious/Playful. When creating a Sim, the player has 25 personality points to give out.Available Lots  The neighborhood screen is actually a save slot in which you can access your saved families. There are different kinds of lots for your Sims to visit:University Bon Voyage FreeTime Apartment Life Neighborhoods  The Sims 2 shipped with 3 pre-made neighborhoods. Seasons, Freetime, and Apartment Life are expansion packs that provide new neighborhoods. Sub-neighborhoods are provided in University, Nightlife, Open for Business, and Bon Voyage. Each neighborhood and sub-neighborhood comes with new pre-made Sims, though the ones in Downtown are all ghosts.Sims  The main aim of the game is to lead a Sim from the start of life to death. A Sim will be born when a female Sim and a male Sim try for a baby. The mother will spend 3 days pregnant before giving birth to a baby (though cheats can be used to speed up pregnancy). Players can name the new Sim. The baby will change into a toddler in 3 days, and 4 more days for the toddler to change into a child. After 8 days, the child morphs into a teenager, and will live 15 days before changing into an adult. After 29 days, the Sim will become an elder and will die, the length of the final stage depending on the aspiration bar when they age. Babies, toddlers, children, teens, and adults can be advanced to their next life stage at any time during the 24 Sim hours before they will grow up automatically. For babies, this requires using the birthday cake. Toddlers, children, teens, and adults can use the \"Grow Up\" self-interaction. If the University expansion pack is installed, teens have the option to go to college, where they will be young adults for approximately 24 days. Players will need to build up talent badges, skills and relationship with other people, so that he can be successful in their career. A player will also need to make sure a Sim is happy and well by fulfilling wants (including lifetime wants, avoiding fears, and fulfilling motives).Types of Sims  There are 3 kind of Sims in the game: Several new types of Sims are introduced in order to enhance gameplay for the user. The new Sims that are introduced give the player more gameplay options and assists with the creation of player storylines.Activities  There are several activities for Sims to engage in that will help them fulfill their wants and needs. There are also objects and interactions in the game to assist Sims with performing these activities.Social  There are several new social interactions introduced in The Sims 2. These new social interactions can create memories and can be related to certain age groups. Social interactions can come up in the Wants and Fears panel and can be dependent on the Sim's personality and aspiration. Sims with certain personalities may not want to complete certain social interactions. Influencing social interactions are introduced in the University expansion pack. A Sim is able to influence another Sim to complete a social interaction or a chore. Sims gain influence points by completing Wants and can lose influence points by completing Fears. The size of the influence bar depends on the number of friends that the Sim has. It also can grow in size with business perks from the Open for Business expansion pack. The Nightlife expansion pack introduces Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs. Teenagers and older are able to choose their turn-ons and turn-offs. These determine the chemistry that one Sims has with another in the form of lightning bolts. Sims can have up to 3 lightning bolts with another Sim. The higher the chemistry is that a Sim has with another Sim, the greater the chance for social interactions to be accepted. New turn-ons and turn-offs are introduced with the Bon Voyage expansion pack. Fury is introduced in the Nightlife expansion pack and occurs when one Sim gets angry at another. During this time relationships with the Sim who is furious are harder to build. Also, the Sim who is furious may pick a fight or vandalize the home lot of the Sim they are furious with. Reputation is introduced in the Apartment Life expansion pack. A Sim gains reputation by interacting with other Sims on community lots. Sims with higher reputations are more likely to gain perks such as free objects and job promotions.Careers  There are several careers that come with the game that require skills and a certain number of friends in order for promotion. Success in these careers unlocks career rewards and higher salaries plus bonuses. Sims also will receive chance cards. Correct answers to these chance cards will create rewards for Sims while incorrect answers could cause a Sim to lose its job. Nightlife and Apartment Life allow Sims to gain promotions through social interactions with other Sims. For a complete list of careers see Career TracksSkill Building  There are several skills that Sims can build in order to fulfill their wants and needs. Some skills are hidden while some create talent badges. Skills are added in the FreeTime, Apartment Life, Open for Business, Seasons and University expansion packs. Hobbies are introduced in The Sims 2: FreeTime. Sims can choose any hobby they want to pursue but they will have one hobby that they will be better at. Each hobby is associated with a certain skill and having high skill points in that skill can help the Sim reach hobby levels quicker. When a Sim reaches the highest hobby level, they can get \"In the Zone.\" This allows Sims to complete the hobby without needs dropping quickly. The ten hobbies are:Scenarios  There are several timed scenarios in the game that players must complete in order to fill wants and needs.Game editions and add-ons Editions Expansion packs  Eight expansion packs (EPs) were released. Expansion packs add new gameplay options as well as objects.Stuff packs  Ten stuff packs were released. Stuff packs add items to the game and usually don't add any new interactions. Holiday Party Pack and Mansion and Garden Stuff were the only two packs to add new interactions.Compilations with the original The Sims 2 game Compilations of expansion & stuff packs The Sims 2 Launcher  Starting with The Sims 2: Bon Voyage, EA included a launcher to start the game. This feature is also included in expansion packs, stuff packs, and compilations released after Bon Voyage. It will display which Expansion Packs and Stuff Packs the player has installed, and will show a large Play button. When connected to the internet, the launcher would also display news updates for The Sims 2, as well as promotional material. The news display has been discontinued due to the removal of The Sims 2 website, but the Launcher still displays promotional material for other games in the series. There is a delay between the time the Play button appears and the time this promotional pane loads, and it is possible to click the Play button before the promotional pane finishes loading. As of August 24, 2013, it is necessary to do this, or to otherwise bypass the Launcher, as some of the new promotional content has been observed to cause the Launcher to stop responding.The Sims 2 Store  The Sims 2 Store was an online store launched in July 2008 where players used real money to purchase items from expansion and stuff packs. Exclusive store items were also released for players to purchase. Money was converted to Sim points and $1 = 100 Sim points. Items ranged from 25-250 Sim points. To download the content, players needed to install The Sims 2 Store Edition and the EA Download Manager (now Origin). On March 31, 2011, EA closed The Sims 2 Store, and ended support of The Sims 2 Store Edition.Pre-release Version  During development the graphics of the game were distinctly different from the final version, with different models and lighting used. There are screenshots and videos featuring many assets that ultimately went unused, such as beehive and French braid hairstyles, as well as unreleased neighborhoods such as Riverside and Waterside. The former two were mostly used in video previews and a third neighborhood, Sedona, is included as a terrain template in the final release. Several features were intended to be included in the game but were removed before the final release, such as Weather and rain. More scenarios were planned, including power outage, grandchild, engagement and Big Boss scenarios. The user interface originally resembled the interface from SimCity 4, but was later changed to a completely different interface. Other minor elements such as hospital births, shoplifting, and breakfast in bed were also intended to be in the game but were ultimately cut. A common rumor is that an early version of The Sims 2 was destroyed in a server room fire at EA, forcing them to recreate much of the game from scratch. Although a server fire did occur, it did not affect the game's development.Cheats  Cheats can be used to enhance the gameplay experience or assist in the creation of movies and stories. To activate a cheat type CTRL + SHIFT + C to open the cheat console and then enter the cheat.Trivia External links Vampire  Vampires are a life state first introduced in The Sims 2: Nightlife, where they are both playable and non-playable creatures. Vampires returned in The Sims 3: Late Night and were further revamped in The Sims 3: Supernatural. Vampires are also reintroduced in The Sims 4: Vampires.The Sims: Makin' Magic  Vampires do not really play a role in The Sims, not even in Makin' Magic. The only character who is presumed to be an actual vampire is Vicki Vampiress, an NPC who operates the \"All Things Draconic\" cart in Magic Town. Sims cannot become vampires, but a magical adult Sim who successfully uses the \"Beauty or Beast\" charm can temporarily take on the appearance of a vampire. This is purely cosmetic, and the Sim remains a normal Sim in all respects.The Urbz: Sims in the City (handheld)  Vampires are one of the story elements in The Urbz: Sims in the City for GBA and DS. After the player's Urb washes up at the Bayou, Crawdad Clem and Bayou Boo suspect that they are a vampire, and the player must answer questions to prove that they aren't. Later, when the player's Urb has to go in the Dark Tree, a Grand Vampire appears, but the player scares them off with a glowing rod. When Bayou Boo shows the player's Urb the secret passage to return to Miniopolis, he gets captured on the way. He later appears in Mission 6, where it is revealed that he has been turned into a vampire and is chained up in the secret passage. The player then must pick the lock of the chain and speak to Mambo Loa about vampirism. She tells the player that the cure for vampirism is a heavy chocolate dish. The player then makes a\u00a0Chocolate Decadence, and feeds it to Bayou Boo, which cures his vampirism.The Sims 2: Nightlife  Vampires were introduced in\u00a0Nightlife. They have bluish-gray skin, red eyes, and fangs. The game-generated\u00a0Grand Vampire\u00a0NPCs wear Victorian-style clothing, apparently influenced by historical depictions of vampires.Becoming a Vampire  Vampirism is transmitted via the\u00a0bite neck\u00a0interaction performed by a Sim who is already a vampire, such as a\u00a0Grand Vampire, who will initially only bite Sims with whom they have a high relationship; however, once the Grand Vampire has bitten a Sim, their likelihood of biting other (playable or unplayable) Sims is increased until the lot is reloaded. Non-Grand Vampire Sims still require a high relationship in order to successfully bite another Sim. Other Sims can also Influence a vampire to bite another Sim, though it will likely be successful only if it is a Grand Vampire that is influenced to do so.Features  In addition to their characteristic coloration and dentition, vampires possess unique animations such as stalking about with an arm over their face, transforming into a bat for faster or more efficient routing, and a scowling portrait in the interaction pie menu. Vampires gain the Bleh!!!\u00a0interaction, which lowers the bladder need of target non-vampire Sim and can be used regardless of relationship. Teenage Vampires can get the undead scholarship to go to college, though the memory description will incorrectly describe the Sim as a\u00a0zombie. Vampires cease to age past adulthood and cannot die of old age or\u00a0starvation, even if their\u00a0hunger\u00a0reaches zero.  Their motives become static during the night (unless depleted by specific activities), but drop quickly during the day. A\u00a0vampire exposed to daylight will sizzle and smoke and see their needs plummet rapidly; if they are not directed indoors quickly, they will burn to ash and die. For this reason, they must sleep in a coffin or meditate during the day. Due to their nocturnal nature, they can be contacted via phone after other Sims complain of being woken up, but cannot be called between 7 AM and 6 PM; a vampire who owns a computer may be chatted with online at any time. Other creature Sims can also become vampires, and possess unique combinations of physical traits.\u00a0Alien, PlantSim, and evil-aligned witch\u00a0vampires\u00a0will have turquoise skin,\u00a0while zombie\u00a0vampires\u00a0turn dark blue.\u00a0Werewolf\u00a0vampires will retain their vampiric appearances during the day, and look like werewolves at night.\u00a0Servo\u00a0vampires gain fangs, a red eye, and a small bat tattoo on their heads.Curing Vampirism  If at any time the Sim grows tired of the vampire life, Vampirism can be cured with Vamprocillin-D, purchasable from the Matchmaker\u00a0or\u00a0brewable by\u00a0witches. Other Sims can Influence vampire Sims to drink Vamprocillin-D, provided they have the potion in their inventory (this can be accomplished by giving it to them as a gift). Once cured, the Sim will be returned to normal; they will be able to go out in the day but will lose all the perks of being a creature of the night.Wanting and Fearing Vampirism  Sims will not necessarily have wants or fears related to vampirism, but if they do, all Sims except Knowledge and Pleasure Sims will fear it. Knowledge Sims will want it, and once bitten will fear curing it. The memory of becoming a vampire is always positive, even if the Sim feared becoming one.Controlling/Avoiding Vampirism  The Grand Vampires will not appear in a neighborhood that does not have a Downtown sub-neighborhood associated with it. Vampires will not bite autonomously until a playable Sim has been turned into one. Since that requires some positive action on the part of the player, whether or not to have vampires (other than the Grand Vampires) is effectively a matter of player's choice. Jfade has a set of mods which can be used to control vampires' biting. One keeps vampires from biting NPCs. This can be useful, as once Grand Vampires start biting autonomously, they may attempt to bite Mrs. Crumplebottom, which can lead to game corruption. Another only allows them to bite on residential lots, while the third disables biting altogether.Trivia The Sims 3 The Sims 3: Late Night  While not included in the base game, vampires are included in The Sims 3: Late Night expansion pack as well as a theme pack for The Sims 3 iPhone. Without the Late Night expansion pack, using CAS, players can create a Sim with a pale skin, red eyes, and (with custom content) protruding teeth, for a vampire-looking Sim.\u00a0The Sims 3: Supernatural\u00a0unlocks the ability to create vampire Sims from\u00a0CAS, even if the player has not previously installed\u00a0The Sims 3: Late Night. Unlike The Sims 2, vampires do not die when they are exposed to sunlight. Instead, they will begin to smoke and will get a negative moodlet when they step outside during the day. If a vampire remains exposed to sunlight, it will eventually pass out and will not be able to use its abilities. Also, the player will get a message if a vampire Sim steps outside during the day. Vampires in The Sims 3: Late Night look relatively normal, although they have paler skin and shinier eyes than regular Sims. (If the player would like to make a light skin, then \"testingcheatsenabled true\" may be used. There should be an option to edit the Sim in CAS.) Players can usually pick them out in a crowd by their bright eyes, and possibly by the spiky tattoo on their neck. Sims receive this tattoo after becoming vampires, though it is possible that this tattoo could also be selected in CAS (via \"unlockoutfits\" cheat code). A regular Sim, unless he or she has the Brave or Evil traits, will get the Hunted moodlet whenever a vampire who they are not friends with is around. Once a Sim has met a vampire, the vampire will show up in that Sim's relationships panel with a red box around his or her picture. The Sim can use \"Ask to Turn\" with the vampire, whereby he or she will hold out their arm, and the vampire will bite them on their wrist. If they have a high or romantic relationship with the vampire, the vampire will bite the Sim on the neck instead. If a playable Sim is a vampire, then the player can offer to turn any Sim, but if the Sim refuses, the human Sim will get the \"Freaked Out\" moodlet. If there are too many other Sims around, or if the player's Sim doesn't have a high enough relationship level with the vampire, he or she may be rejected from receiving \"the gift.\" After the bite, he or she will have a moodlet describing a mosquito or spider bite. The Sim will then turn into a vampire after 2\u20133 days. Although vampires can travel, a transforming Sim who is trying to board a plane will be noticed by the flight attendant due to the blemish and will be refused by security. If the Moodlet Manager is used on the human with the moodlet, the Sim will become a vampire. Vampirism can be cured by buying a cure from the science lab, which costs 3000 simoleons. After being cured, the vampire will lose its vampire form and powers and will become a normal Sim. Vampires can also have children that will be born with Vampirism. These vampire children can also be cured. Vampires grow up as normal Sims do, but age five times slower than normal once they reach adulthood.The Sims 3: Supernatural  Vampires are improved upon in The Sims 3: Supernatural. When this expansion pack is installed, the Vampire life state will be available whether or not The Sims 3: Late Night is installed. Vampires in Supernatural are essentially the same as the ones in Late Night, but with added features, customization, and social interactions. Unlike in Late Night, they can be created in CAS, and become immune to the sunlight by using the Vampiric Sunscreen elixir. Vampires can become immortal if they get the Immortal lifetime reward. Certain elixirs can either cause vampirism or cure it. With\u00a0Supernatural\u00a0installed, vampire features and abilities are enhanced. More interactions are included, such as hypnotic gaze, intimidate, show off teeth, talk about the joy of plasma, and so on. They can also confess or deny their state as a vampire to Sims who are exploiting their weaknesses and accusing them as vampires.\u00a0 Other features implemented in The Sims 3: Supernatural are Plasma Juice and Plasma Orange Juice, as seen in Late Night. The juices are basically blood in a juice box and can be accessed from the fridge by a vampire Sim. Plasma fruit can be obtained by raiding a grocery store (with a chance of getting arrested), or growing it by planting the fruit or the glowing unknown rare seed. If a vampire Sim has the Vegetarian trait, they will need to live off of these Plasma Products, and if they drink from another Sim they will suffer the same consequences as a Vegetarian human Sim eating meat.The Sims 4: Vampires  The Sims 4: Vampires introduces the vampire life state with a whole bunch of new supernatural powers and abilities. Vampires can alter their appearance between their regular and dark forms, and can use supernatural abilities including super speed, turning into a bat, super strength, etc... Vampires can replenish their thirst need, which replaces hunger, by drinking from another Sim (either willfully or by mind-controlling them), consuming a plasma fruit or a plasma pack, or eating a plasma fruit salad after discovering the recipe. Vampires must also stay out of the sunlight during daylight hours, though the severity of the effects that sunlight has on a vampire is based on the rank of the vampire and their perks.Becoming a vampire Create a Sim  Like aliens in The Sims 4: Get to Work, vampires can be made straight from Create a Sim and have their own special CAS options, such as having an alternative \"dark\" form, editing their eyes to be unnatural eye colors, pale skin tones, different fang types, veins and etc.Turned  Sims can ask vampires to be turned. If they comply, the vampire will bite the Sim and then offer them their blood which the Sim will drink. However, a player controlled vampire can also turn other Sims without request. Sims will not immediately transform, but will get the \"Strangely Hungry\" moodlet which causes their hunger need to drain. This moodlet lasts about 12 hours. Once the moodlet expires, Sims will get a second moodlet, named \"Disgusted by Food\", which lasts another 12 hours. Once that moodlet expires, a third moodlet is added, called \"Appetite Lost\". Once this moodlet is added, Sims will be unable to gain other food-related moodlets (except Nauseous) until the transformation is complete. Once this moodlet expires the Sim is finally transformed into a creature of the dark, gaining a Tense moodlet, named \"Thirsty\", for the first 24 hours of his/her vampirism. When a vampire turns a human Sim, they become a master, and the human turned vampire becomes their vampire offspring. Turning Sims into vampires is only possible if the \"Vampire Creation\" perk has been purchased.Vampires Powers  Vampires will have their own panel to gain and upgrade new abilities that make them more powerful. New powers include mind control, shape-shifting into a bat, faster transportation, increased strength, reduced needs, and more.Weaknesses  Vampires all start out with weaknesses, most that can be overcome by purchasing perks in the Vampire Powers menu. Vampires start off with these basic weaknesses: Vampires can purchase garlic immunity, the three tiers of sun resistance, and/or the tamed thirst perks which can counteract these basic weaknesses. Vampires may also concoct a sunlight reversal cocktail with high vampire lore skill, which effectively reverses their weakness to sunlight. Instead of draining their vampiric energy while out in the sun, this cocktail causes them to gain vampiric energy when exposed to the sun's rays.\u00a0 If the The Sims 4: Seasons\u00a0is installed, vampires may go out during the day during cloudy weather, as well as blizzards and thunderstorms unharmed.\u00a0 Umbrellas may also be carried to protect from the harmful rays of the sun during the day.\u00a0Additionally, vampires are immune to most side effects of the temperature system, including freezing to death and overheating.\u00a0 There are more weaknesses that have to be taken in order to grow as a vampire, such as sloppy drinking, further weakness to sunlight, uncontrollable hissing, unable to eat normal food, guilt from feeding on a Sim without their permission, reduced power gain while sleeping, etc...Dark Form  Just like aliens from The Sims 4: Get to Work, vampires have a sim form and an alternative form in which they can switch between to keep their vampiric presence from being revealed. Vampires will switch into their \"Dark Form\" to turn into their true vampiric nature and access some of their supernatural powers, such as feeding and turning other sims. The Dark Form can be fully customized separately from the normal form in CAS. Sims who have been turned will be assigned a randomly generated Dark Form, which can be changed, or removed via any mirror. \"Dark Form\" is totally optional, and the Player will not be penalized for not using it. Both forms have the exact same customization options, and Vampires without a Dark Form will have access to the same abilities as Vampires with Dark Forms.Vampire Needs  Vampires have different needs to normal Sims. Vampires do not need to cater to a bladder meter and their energy need is elongated and replaced with \"Vampire Energy\" as well as the hunger need being replaced with a \"Thirst\" need for plasma. The needs panel also showcases the experience to achieve the next vampire rank and the power points. Vampires who don't replenish their thirst will attack random Sims and feed from them if it's low enough. Vampires who low Vampire Energy while they're out in the sunlight will die of sunlight exposure and burst into flames. Vampires can also replenish their Vampire Energy through the typical sleeping through a bed, sleeping in a coffin, or dark meditation. See the page on Vampire powers for more information.Interactions  Vampires have special interactions which are all marked by a bat symbol in the interaction. Vampires can also use their powers on other Sims even if they are also a vampire.Interactions to other Vampires  Vampires can interact with others like them by showing off their powers, sparring, and vampire training. Sparring enacts a battle between two vampires as a test of strength. Vampires can enact in a friendly version of sparring where as enemies can fight each other, damaging their relationship further. Vampires can also slay each other if their relationship is low enough. If the vampire that started the fight has a Ultimate Vampire Cure in their inventory, they will throw it in the losing vampire's face, curing them of their vampirism. If the fight was unsuccessful then the Ultimate Vampire Cure is not used.Vampire Offspring  When vampires turn Sims, that Sim once turned will become the vampire's offspring, as seen in the relationships panel. Vampire's offspring and their master can interact with each other just like any other Sim except the master's powers will work more efficiently on them, with the \"I am the Master\" aspiration reward trait from the \"Vampire Family\" aspiration, vampire master's can make their offspring's be under an irresistible command.Curing Vampirism  Vampirism can be cured by obtaining a glass of \"Ultimate Vampire Cure\" which is a concoction that can be made at a bar by Sims with a maxed out Vampire lore skill (level 15). Once made, Vampires can voluntarily take it and cure themselves, or other Sims can use the \"Slay Vampire\" interaction with a cure in their inventory and once they win the battle the Sim will throw the cure into the vampire's face and cure them, this can be done by other vampires as well.Trivia External links References Grim Reaper  The Grim Reaper is an NPC who appears in The Sims: Livin' Large, The Sims 2, The Sims 3, The Sims 4 and The Sims Medieval. He also appears in The Sims FreePlay as part of the \"Life Dreams\" update. He spawns on the lot when a Sim dies, performing various animations in front of the dying Sim before spawning an urn or a tombstone.Biography Appearance in The Sims: Livin' Large  In addition to his appearance when a Sim dies, he will also appear and ring the doorbell if there are more than five Jack-O-Lanterns on the lot, a reference to trick-or-treating. There is a suggested malevolence about him, as can be seen from the results when Sims plead with him. Bonehilda is a huge fan of Grim Reaper, and will try to get an autograph from him when he's present while she's out of her closet. When the Grim Reaper appears, he will move over to the dead Sim and wave his scythe, and any adult Sim can plea with the Grim Reaper and attempt to save the Sim's life. If the Grim Reaper is in a bad mood, the Sim will die regardless. If the Grim Reaper is in a good mood, however, he will challenge the pleading Sim to a game of rock, paper, scissors \u2014 if the pleading Sim loses, the dead Sim will be resurrected as a zombie; if they win, however, the Sim will be fully resurrected.Appearance in The Sims 2  In The Sims 2, the Reaper's appearance is different from that in other games: he is grey and wraithlike rather than skeletal and black. Olive Specter has memories of WooHoo with him and giving birth to Nervous Subject shortly after, though this is impossible in normal gameplay. Through use of cheats a biography of him can be seen containing some tongue-in-cheek information. With the University expansion pack he can be bribed to resurrect dead Sims with the Resurrect-O-Nomitron, which is the career reward for the Paranormal career track. (The question of why he might want or need money is left to the imagination.) If the last Sim on the lot dies, one of a variety of sardonic messages will appear. On occasion, he will interact with one of the items in the house before leaving. So far, he has only been known to get a blended drink from a minibar, watch television, relax on a bed, use the toilet, and/or play on the computer. When a Sim dies of starvation, fright or by disease, they stand up, wave their hand (if dying by starvation), collapse on their knees and then lie down to a conformable position. The Grim Reaper walks towards the dead body and turns them into a grave. When Sims die of old age, there are two life endings they can get, based on their aspiration. If they have any aspiration level from failure to green, the Grim Reaper will come with a black trail of smoke, and hold up an empty hourglass, meaning that the Sim has no more time to live. The Sim will then try to grab the hourglass out of Death's hand and try to flip it back over. The Grim Reaper then snatches it back, and angrily points in a direction. The Sim walks there, and an urn or grave (plain grey) is created. If the dying Sim is in gold or platinum aspiration, Death will come wearing a pink Hawaiian lei, and will have a white smoke trail. Two Hula Zombies will appear in the room, and relaxing Hawaiian music will play. Death will slowly point at the dying Sim in a non-angry way, and the Sim will back up, and act shy. Death will then hold his arms out as if to hug the Sim, then will give him or her a tiki glass with a lemon on the side. Then Death will pack the Sim's bags, and the Sim, still being timid, will smile and slowly head off to the afterlife. If the Sim was in platinum aspiration, their urn or grave will be gold and white, and will show the symbol for their aspiration. In general, when two Sims in a household are scheduled to die on the same day, the Grim Reaper will first come for one, and will come back later for the other. However, if both members of a married or joined couple are scheduled to die on the same day, he may take both at once.The Sims 2 (console)  In this version the Grim Reaper only appears when a Sim has died. Sims cannot plead with him to save their loved ones. He can be only interacted with by ghost Sims. The Sim has an option to challenge him by playing the violin (if the Sim has a high creativity, charisma and logic skill and has died in a Platinum mood, he/she has higher chances of winning) or pay him \u00a7100 to return to life. In either cases, the Sim will be resurrected and the Grim Reaper will burn and disappear.The Sims 2 (Nintendo DS)  In The Sims 2 for Nintendo DS, the Grim Reaper's appearance is completely different to his usual black robes and scythe. Instead, he wears what appears to be a large brown coat and large brown hat he looks a bit like a creepy ghostly cowboy. It can also be seen that he has yellow eyes. Also, instead of the scythe, he uses a sack to \"collect\" the dead Sims. Concept art of him can be unlocked throughout the progress of the game.Appearance in The Sims 3  The Reaper of The Sims 3 has little backstory, and never appears outside of death sequences unless moved in before patch or the player owns The Door Of Life And Death (The Sims Store). There is a statue of him in Pleasant Rest Graveyard in Sunset Valley. His skin tone is midnight black, and wears a black hooded robe. He has a very deep voice, but if moved in he will have voice 1 at an average pitch. The reason for this is unexplained. In this game, a Sim can no longer plead for a deceased Sim's life, but after a certain patch they will need to play chess with him and win.Appearance in The Sims Medieval  The Grim Reaper's entire appearance is changed to fit the \"Medieval\" theme, such as changing his outfit from the color black to red, giving him small wings, giving him purple hands with long nails instead of the bony ones and re-doing his scythe. When the Reaper appears, he will make the dead Sim's spirit fly into the air. Then, he will disappear by going under the earth, taking the corpse Sim with him. In this game he cannot be pleaded for a Sim's life.Appearance in The Sims 4  In The Sims 4, the Grim Reaper has a slightly different physical appearance compared to the previous series. The Grim Reaper wears a black, modern cloak, instead of a torn-down cloak. When reaping the souls, the Grim Reaper no longer has the death list on a piece of paper. Instead, he'll use a tablet where he keeps the death list.Gameplay mechanics The Sims: Livin' Large  The Grim Reaper will appear in a cloud of skulls next to the mailbox, then walk over to the dying Sim and spend a short amount of time waving his scythe. If the path to the dying Sim is blocked, he will teleport there instead. During this time another Sim may be directed to approach and plead with him. This option is not available for children. There is around a 50% chance of him accepting the plea, at which point he will play a game of rock-paper-scissors with the pleader. If the Sim loses there is still a 50% chance of him bringing the deceased back to life as a zombie, with their skin colored green and their personality wiped. Usually, the Grim Reaper will be in a bad mood and turn down the plea, and the Sim will die, but will come back as a ghost, being see-through and greenish-blue and walk around \"spooking\" Sims and making windy ghost noises. If Livin' Large is not installed, the Grim Reaper will not appear; instead, the dying Sim will spawn a tombstone automatically.The Sims 2  The Grim Reaper can be pleaded with as in Livin' Large; however, the chance of success is directly linked to the relationship score of the pleader to the deceased: if the total of the daily and lifetime relationship is below 25, the plea is guaranteed to fail. If it is above that level, the percentage chance of the plea succeeding is equal to that same number, which is capped at 90. If the plea succeeds, the Sim is \"Saved From Death\", which is frequently a major want for Knowledge Sims. If the death is from old age, the plea interaction will be unavailable. Sims must be able to reach the Grim Reaper to plead with him; if a Sim drowns too far from the edge of a pool, this interaction will not be available. In University, the Resurrect-O-Nomitron reward from the Paranormal career enables Sims to call the Reaper and pay him to bring back Sims who they have a relationship with. The precise results depend on the payment: In The Sims 2: FreeTime, Sims may ask the genie to give them the power to cheat death. This enables them to plead for their own life with a 100% chance of success the first time, which decreases by 10% with each subsequent attempt. Sims who die of old age will only get an extra day. In The Sims 2: Apartment Life, good witches with Level 9 magic skill and the correct ingredients can cast the Expello Mortis spell to banish the Grim Reaper, saving a dying Sim. Also, an evil witch with 9 Magic skill points and correct ingredients can cast the Vivificus Zombiae spell at the tombstone or urn of a Sim, and the Sim will return as a zombie.The Sims Life Stories  In The Sims Life Stories, if a Sim successfully saves a Sim from the Grim Reaper, a message from the Grim Reaper will appear at the top right of the screen saying \"You intrigue me mortal, I am going to hang out here for awhile to find out how you beat me.\" The Sim who defeated the Grim Reaper will then greet the Grim Reaper, and then the Grim Reaper will stay at the Sim's house for a while and play chess.The Sims 2 (console)  All Sims that die will be reborn as ghosts where they can find the Grim Reaper standing at the front of the lot where they can challenge him to a fiddle contest. Sims that have a higher creativity skill and have died when in Platinum mood have a higher chance of winning. If the Sim wins then the Grim Reaper will disappear. As a ghost, the Sim is more likely to have the aspiration goals of: If the player wishes not to choose the fiddle challenge or simply gives up, they can pay a fee of \u00a7100 to return to life.The Sims 3  The Grim Reaper appears when a Sim or pet dies. However unlike the previous games, the Grim Reaper will literally \"reap\" the spirit of the Sim to turn it into a ghost, while the remaining Sims around the household or lot will mourn for him/her. The appearance of this ghost is determined by the way the Sim has died. Unlike previous games, a Sim can no longer plea for the dead Sim's life. However, if a Sim in the household owns a chessboard they may play chess against him to resurrect the dying Sim after a certain patch. The Grim Reaper may have 3-6 logic skill points and 3-6 hidden chess skill points. If the deceased Sim has a death flower in their inventory, then they will automatically give it to the Grim Reaper shortly after becoming a ghost and their lives will be spared in exchange for the flower. The Grim Reaper will also refuse to take Sims with the unlucky trait who die accidentally, because (according to him) their lives provide too much amusement for himself. With The Sims 3: Pets, pets can harass the Grim Reaper and save their master. The pet has to be at least best friends with the Sim to do this. There is a 35% chance pets will harass the Grim Reaper, and an additional +10% chance if they have aggressive, loyal, or brave traits; or -10% if they have clueless, lazy, nervous, or skittish traits. A pet cannot save the same Sim from death more than once. There is a 20% chance that he will stay for a short period of time after he's done with his job, and an additional +5% for each Sim that dies on the lot. The maximum chance is 75%. During this time, Sims may hang out and socialize with the Grim Reaper. The Grim Reaper will behave as if he were a guest; such as watching TV or using toilet. He will not hang around if the Sim dies in a diving area, however. If a Sim dies from vending machine, the Grim Reaper may attempt to buy a soda from the vending machine and drink from it. The soda will pass through his body and leave a puddle on the ground which will remain after he leaves.The Sims Medieval  The Grim Reaper has a totally different appearance in this stand-alone. The Grim Reaper, like in every game, comes to collect the souls of the deceased Sims. However, he doesn't stay around, like he usually does in The Sims 3 and can't be made playable without the use of cheats. His appearance also appears to be very medieval, sporting bright colors along the robes, a golden belt, and bright red caps. A promotional picture seen to the right depicts a new Grim Reaper with a red robe, long white hair, black wings, a different scythe, and a belt with a skull and hourglass on it. It is possible that it is the same Grim just dressing to fit the medieval theme of that era, or that he is the ancestor of all of the other Grim Reapers in the series.The Sims 4  When a Sim dies, the Grim Reaper will appear from a cloud of smoke. He will walk towards the Sim who has died; upon confronting the dead he will consult his tablet, and then proceed to reap the soul out of the Sim and replace the body with an urn or gravestone. Any living Sims on the lot can attempt to plead with the Grim Reaper in which there is a 33% chance of the Grim Reaper bringing the Sim back to life, or downright rejecting the plea. After the Grim Reaper is finished, there is a chance he may stick around on the lot, in which other Sims can perform social interactions on him. However, romantic interactions generally will not go very far. The Grim Reaper gives unique answers when asked about career or if single.Hints and tips The Sims 2 Grimwear  Players can dress a Sim as the Grim Reaper by using cheats. While in the neighborhood, bring up the cheat box (press Ctrl+Shift+C) and type \"boolProp testingcheatsenabled true\" without quotes. Then go to Create-A-Sim mode and press Shift+N. This will activate CAS Debugging Mode (a message says so in the top right corner of the screen). Press Shift+M to remove CAS Debug Mode. The Grim Reaper suit should be at the end of \"everyday clothing\" in outfits. The player can even make them in the \"Hula Zombie\" outfit that appears when a Sim dies of old age with a high aspiration bar.Strange genetics  Using the Tombstone of Life and Death, Sims can become pregnant by Grim Reaper. The strange thing is that the child will often have light skin, light blue eyes, black hair and the 2nd face in CAS. It is even stranger in the case of Nervous Subject, who has strange genetics. Some players believe that Nervous is not even the Grim Reaper's son, because his genetics are much different than Grim's.The Sims 3 Move in  It is possible to \"Move In\" the Grim Reaper into the active household without the use of any cheats or tools. What one needs is to build a relationship high enough with Grim Reaper when he lingers on the lot (this does not happen often, he will put away his scythe and stop levitating) and ask him to move in. It's good to have the Legendary Host lifetime reward. He cannot be married, and must be moved in. Having the charismatic trait, maxed charisma, charisma challenges completed or the Never Dull lifetime reward can be very helpful here, as he disappears from the relationship panel when he leaves. Having an unlucky or loser traits makes summoning him repeatedly much easier, otherwise the player will only have one chance. Take note that once he is moved in he will disappear, this can be fixed by typing \"Testingcheatsenabled true\" and then shift-clicking the ground and clicking \"Teleport Me Here.\" Also, he will have Voice 1, with an average pitch; this is due to him being generated by the game and treated like a new townie. A player can only use cheats to change his voice to the more appropriate deep voice of Male 3 set to the lowest pitch. The other way to get the Grim Reaper to move in is to first press Ctrl-Shift-C and type in testingcheatsenabled true then, with any Sim, hold shift and click your Mailbox, click \"Make Me Know Everyone\" then go to your Relationship List: keep scrolling until you see the Grim Reaper's face/hood (He shouldn't have the name Grim Reaper though) click on it and select \"Invite Over\" and wait till the Grim Reaper comes. When he does hold shift and click on him, select \"Add Sim to Current Household\" and you should have the Grim Reaper in your Family. You can go to City Hall and change his name to Grim Reaper if you like to. If you use plan outfit/makeover on this Grim Reaper he will just turn into a random black Sim. You can give him traits with shift, click \"Change Traits\". He is no longer a real Grim Reaper so a different real Grim Reaper will still show up. If The Sims 3: Late Night or later is installed, the Grim Reaper can no longer be moved in.Sim/Grim Reaper hybrids  It is possible in games patched below version 1.3 to try for a baby with the Grim Reaper without him being a family member: after patch 1.3 the Grim Reaper must be a family member for such relations to be possible. Hybrids in The Sims 3 can have totally black skin due to the Grim Reaper's unique genetics. The Grim Reaper can be added to the household by having a high relationship with him and asking him to move in. With testing cheats, the players can drag the Sim's relationship with the Grim Reaper to maximum instantly. After that, Sims can try to seduce the Grim Reaper until trying for baby interaction is available. With the Door of Life and Death premium content from TheSims3.com, it is possible to summon a Grim Reaper, build up a relationship with him, and then try for baby with him. However, the Grim Reaper from the door is just a regular generated Sim, disguised with the Grim Reaper outfit. Trying for baby with them does not make the Sim's offspring a Grim Reaper hybrid.How to get a Grim Reaper statue for a residential lot  There is a statue of Grim Reaper in the neighborhood graveyard like one on the Sunset Valley Cemetery. The player must send a Sim with a kleptomaniac trait to the cemetery and tell him/her near the statue to steal. Back at the household, the player may not want a stolen statue standing around, so it may be placed and then copied via the build menu. Then the original statue may be sent back to the cemetery.The Sims Medieval Move in  The Grim Reaper can be moved into a household to get permanent control of him by enabling testingcheatsenabled, shift-clicking on him, and then making him a spouse of the currently selected Sim. His hunger and energy motives will not deplete, and will be treated as a villager that does not fight. He will usually possess the evil or morose traits; his second trait will usually be randomized.The Sims 4 Move in  The Grim Reaper can be moved into a household via testingcheatsenabled. Simply enable the cheat, shift+click on the Grim Reaper before he leaves, and click \"Add to Family\"; this will allow the player to control him. When controllable, players are able to build up his romance bar, as he will be treated like a regular Sim. It is not possible to try for a baby with him. The Grim Reaper can't do some basic actions like sleeping, and instead of walking he will \"hover\" towards his destination. All of his needs except social and fun do not decay, so he does not need to sleep, wash, eat or use the toilet. If a Sim dies after the Grim Reaper is added to a household using testingcheatsenabled, an additional Grim Reaper will be spawned to reap their soul. The new Grim Reaper can also be added to the household, and this process can be repeated to create a household with up to 8 Grim Reapers. Each Grim Reaper will have at least one trait and a random aspiration. In The Sims 4, unlike in other Sims games, adding the Grim Reaper to a household will not cause any issues in the game.Trivia The Sims The Sims 2 The Sims 3 The Sims 4 Twinbrook  Twinbrook is a world which shipped with The Sims 3: Ambitions. It is most likely named after the twin rivers that flow on either side of the richer part of the town, near households such as the Whelohffs.Overview  Grant Rodiek first mentioned Twinbrook in an interview, saying; \"The town of Twinbrook is absolutely beautiful and designed specifically for players. You will clearly see how our world-designing team has improved when you discover Twinbrook.\" Twinbrook stresses the new professions and skills introduced in Ambitions, such as the Stylist profession or Inventing skill. Twinbrook is situated on a bayou (swamp), with many bridges and may be in the state of Simisouri (according to DeAndre Wolf's bio). Much of the town is designed in a French style like many bayou towns. For example, the town library is a classic French design with two porticos, one at both entrances. According to a GameSpot hands-on, Twinbrook 'is a fictitious bayou town not unlike a backwoods suburb of Louisiana.' Players who attended the UK hands on event reported that Twinbrook is 'a huge new town, which had been flooded, and is now half-swamp half-town. The swampy areas are very dank and misty. The other side of Twinbrook has brand new shops such as the laundromat, the tattoo parlor and stylist shop and much more. I really enjoyed having a look around Twinbrook, and the place looks really great. They've also re-done most of the rabbit holes, such as the diner.' It may be assumed that Simslaus Creek references Stanislaus County, a county located in California, or the Stanislaus River located in said county. Interestingly, all the pre-made deceased Sims in Twinbrook are pale green if resurrected. They also have gray hair, are all barefoot, and most (if not all) like the color grey. In this post on thesims3.com, SimGuruLily says that this was intentional, but does not say what the intent was. It is very possible that this is a reference to classic comic book supervillain Solomon Grundy, who was resurrected after being \"buried\" in a swamp, emerging as a green-skinned, white-haired, bare-footed demi-zombie. The town appears to have a larger population of rich Sims than Sunset Valley or Riverview has. These families include the Whelohffs, Pidgins, Knacks, and the Bakers. Additionally, several of the houses belonging to the rich are larger than the Sunset Valley and Riverview wealthy families; most families in Twinbrook start with \u00a75,000 or \u00a710,000 in cash, while in the other worlds almost all families start with around \u00a71000 in cash. Therefore, Twinbrook is, by far, the most wealthy (non-store) world in the game after Bridgeport. Twinbrook is technically an island. This fact is hard to discover, but in gameplay, upon visiting map view and pressing tab, you are able to view a wider range of the town. Unusually, if you follow the river near the Rackets' house, there seem to be buildings which look like skyscrapers. Some people think it is a reference to Bridgeport. The only other worlds which have this are Champs Les Sims, Bridgeport and Sims University.Lots Community Lots Families New families Returning families Homeless Sims  These Sims are premade, but homeless when Twinbrook is first loaded.Notes Trivia References ", "Alliance of Valiant Arms Wiki": "Alliance of Valiant Arms Wiki Rifle Man  The Rifle Man\u00a0(often refrred to as \"Rifleman\")\u00a0is one of three player classes in Alliance of Valiant Arms.Overview  The Rifle Man is outperformed by Pointman in close quarters combat (CQC) and by Sniper in long distance combat assuming player skill levels are equal, but can beat both when outside of each classes respective effective ranges. They are not the best class, but it has the potential to win against all odds as with all the classes. The Rifle Man class has the most diverse type of weapons, ranging from fast firing carbines to high powered rifles, the Rifle Man class can somewhat substitute as the other classes. There are many of the Rifle Man weapons that feature specialized stats, such as the FA-MAS variants, low recoil guns, light weight rifles, light machine guns and battle rifles. With the M14 EBR, Rifle Man can fit a sniping role if they can perform consistent headshots, while with light weight rifles they can rush like the Pointman. The Rifle Man has a better defense rating than any other class which keeps his durability high (Depending on you and your enemy's armor load-out). They are the most well-balanced class in the game, and are the most prominent class from casual players to the world championships. They excel in shooting in short bursts, but tend to crumble when firing in full auto (though there are exceptions based upon weapon stats). The Rifle Man's primary weapon consists of Assault Rifles, which can then be divided into four smaller groups: Standard AR's, Battle Rifles, Machine Guns, and Pseudo-SMGs. An example of each would be the M4A1\u00a0or AK47, the SA58 Para\u00a0or FAL Cannon,the MG4KE , and the FA-MAS\u00a0or AMD65, respectively. Each have a different play-style, and are equally effective. Grenades are essential for the Riflemen. The Rifle Man can throw grenades faster and farther than any other class, so don't forget to use grenades. The famed\u00a0M249 \"Red Tiger\" SAW Heavy Machine Gun, that was once thought to have been un-purchasable, is now available for purchase in the item shop and is fully automatic. It features 40 damage, 70 range, 90 Rate of fire and 100 clip ammo. Because of the low mobility and horrible moveshot, it is hard to use this weapon in most competitive game modes. It can be found in many of the [AI] missions as well as the game-type \"Infection\", with the M249 Leopard as well. In Korean/Japan AVA, it is purchasable, but only for a 24 hour period at an extremely unreasonable price and has dramatic improvements including SMG-like low recoil, and an 100 round clip. So far, UAVA has the blessing of being able to purchase this gun permanently.\u00a0Assault Rifle & Machine Gun Base Stat Comparison Datatable  Some stats are incorrect, the updated stats shows the complete list of statsFull A.V.A Weapons List  Below is a list of all the weapons currently in\u00a0Alliance of Valiant Arms.

Shotguns, SMGs, and Carbines are the PM's weapons of choice. PM weapons are chosen for their high rate of fire and mobility rather than damage and range. One exception to this is the shotguns, which possess high damage, though at the cost of firing rate and range. SMGs are generally used in close to mid range fighting where high rate of fire is more valuable than accuracy, but there are Carbine-type weapons which bridges the gap between SMGs and Assault Rifles. For the sake of simplicity, Carbines are listed alongside the SMGs in this wiki. Examples of PM weaponry include the MP5K Rail, Bizon PP-19, UMP .45, AKS-74U, Benelli M1014, Remington870, and the MP5A3, the default PM weapon. The Point Man is the only class that can equip and remove a silencer on their primary weapon in-game. Doing so increases bloom slightly (often negligibly), and lowers range (up to half) and damage unless the Advanced Silencer mod is equipped. However, it also removes you from the enemies map completely unless they manually spot you, and lets you take enemies by complete suprise even if your first shots miss (to spot, aim at the enemy so their name comes up in red). Thus, Pointmen could be viewed as a CQB/stealth package, although they are rarely seen taking on this role. Note that Silencers are not available for all weapons, nor is it exclusive to this class. However, they are still extremely rare, and non-PM weapons that can implement them are either integrated or must be modded, namely the RX4-Storm, OTs-14 Groza, VSS, ASW 338 and Blaser R93 . Weapons with integrated silencers do NOT suffer a range penalty, and are often good at medium range combat, though they also tend not to have good damage. Select pistols can also attatch and remove silencers, but it is yet to be proven whether they have the same debuffs. Though not directly concerning the Point Man, the Rifleman class has a skill which boosts defense. Since the Point Man gains no (gun-based) damage boost to compensate, this generally puts Pointmen at a disadvantage when facing them unless the Point Man has a weapon with high DPS or high penetration (the latter of which is rare), making only a few of the Point Man Weapons useful without good familiarity. Some of the best Point Man weapons include the MP7, the SR-2M Veresk, the Saiga 12 (all considered \"top tier\"), and the AKS-74U (the runner-up). Some generally not recommended weapons include the SPAS-12, the M4 Spectre, and the UMP45.\u00a0 It should be noted that the point Man has never made an appearance in an A.V.A. Grand Final World Championship Finals match. This is because Pointmen are relatively inaccurate at range and thus ineffective for longer range headshots. Riflemen and Snipers, while still suited for long-range, can still be acceptable at close range with proper mods/training, thus leading to redundancy. At CGO #4 (Mar. 26th/27th, 2011), A clan named \"KTop\" using the Point Man class instead of Sniper during whole Tournament impressed lots of PM users. This so called Fast&Furious method is stilll being discussed by the old gamers. KTxBullGoM, who was a clan leader of the KTop and the Point Man participated on the Tournament made the best use of speed of Point Man as a role of recon scout. Nevertheless, \"KTop\" clan was awarded the second place of the CGO Tournament.\u00a0 The Point Man is used almost exclusively during AVA Soccer matches as they have melee bonuses and is the class that fares the best in Prison-themed AI missions (Death Valley, PB: Survival, etc.)Strengths  Pointmen are known for their speed and lethal CQB abilities.Weaknesses Class Skills Full Point Man Weapon List Tips Sniper  The Sniper is one of the three player classes in Alliance of Valiant Arms.Overview  The Sniper use Sniper Rifles as their primary weapon. Since their defense rating and movement speed are rather low as compared to the other two classes, Snipers are suited for long range combat. The rifles they use are very powerful, but are only accurate when the user is looking through the scope. When there just isn't enough time to look through the scope, aim at the general direction of an oncoming enemy and fire during close quarters combat. With that being said, it's best for Snipers to stay away from the major combat areas, shooting down enemies from afar and up high. Snipers are very skilled with Sniper Rifles and pistols to make up for their lack of CQB performance. Depending on the skill level of the sniper, they can be deadly at any range. The majority of the top tier sniper rifles tend to have insanely fast scoping speed, allowing snipers to execute the much needed quickscope at close range.\u00a0 Of all classes, Snipers have the largest range of weapon costs. It has the AVA's most inexpensive weapon (Galil Sniper at 31,000) and AVA's most expensive weapon (Pgm.338 at 59,000). However, keep in mind that a higher price does not always entail a better gun. Though not purchasable, the \"best\" sniper rifle in the game statwise is the Barrett M82 Anti-Material Sniper Rifle. It is a one shot kill regardless of where it hits a target and is Semi-automatic.It can only be found on certain levels, including the [AI] Annihilation missions (after being dropped by Eva) and the Sniper Gallery. The use of this gun is generally NOT frowned upon, as it has VERY strong recoil (thus not \"noobish\"), low ammo count, and is dropped in the center of levels it's available on, thus making it a prize to race for rather than a match-breaking gift. It is, however, considered by some to be very \"noobish\" to NOT get kills when holding the rifle. Even if one dies holding the rifle,\u00a0\u00a0it could still be used to get effect against the enemy\u00a0if it is picked up by a teammate. Therefore, one should not be afriad to pick it up only when the area is clear. Bolt Action There are two different types of Sniper rifles, Bolt-Action (nicknamed \"Bolt\") and Semi-Automatic (dubbed \"Semi\"). Bolt Actions' performance is superior\u00a0overall\u00a0and easier to master. However, they require a moment between shots to chamber each cartridge. Within the bolt action sniper rifles, there are two classes. The first class sports the highest damage but the lowest rate of fire. This class includes the TPG-1 and the PGM. These tend to have high scope magnifications. The second class sports a slightly lower damage for a slightly higher rate of fire and mobility. This class includes the FR-F2 and the ASW, both having lower zoom than the first class. While the second class has a slightly higher chance to wound instead of kill, the extra mobility and lower zoom makes them more capable at closer ranges and vice versa. The 1-hit-kill power makes bolt action rifles unrivaled for surpise attacks, assaults down long corridors, and supporting a teammate's charge from afar. In addition, in trained hands, it's instant-kill ability can also be exploited to clear corners at close range and deny the enemy from assaulting stratigic points. Ergo, the bolt action excels at both long range and close range against single opponents. However, against an assault of multiple oppoents, the bolt action's slow rate of fire is its main drawback so the user should position himself so only one enemy can engage him at any point in time. Semi Automatic The semi-automatic sniper rifle is the most difficult class of weapon in AVA to master, but could be used to great effect as a \"designated marksmen's rifle\" or, DMR. Semi-automatics excels at counter-sniper and close support.\u00a0 As a general rule of thumb, seek out either the rifle with the highest damage OR the highest rate of fire + low recoil. While rare, a semi-automatic with a high chance to one-hit kill an opponent with\u00a0full health such as the WA-2000 and SVD Zebra can compensate for its low rate of fire. On the other hand, a semi-automatic with a high rate of fire such as the HK417, Mad Galil, or the VSS Katana can compensate for its low damage via its high rate of fire, penetration, and range, making a quick double tap on any opponent a garunteed kill. A middle ground semi-automatic like the MSG90A1, while doing more damage than the HK417 and having a higher rate of fire than the WA-2000, is still garunteed to always wound an enemy with full health with only one shot. Worse, it would also lack the rate of fire of an HK417 to quickly fire a follow up shot, thus leaving the marksman vulnerable. Any semi-automatic that needs three or more shots to kill like the VSS should not be considered at all. For high rate-of-fire semi automatics, a low and predictable recoil recoil pattern will dictate how fast you can accurately land your next shot. The main advantage of a semi-automatic, moveshot, is also very important. If the semi-automatic rifle does not have full stability when running while zoomed in, buy the Sniper Field Manual III to be more effective. Needing to press shift to fire a shot will negate any advantage it has over the opposing sniper and his bolt-action. It is therefore imperative a marksmen choose his semi-automatics wisely.\u00a0 The strength of semi-automatic marksmen is his ability to bring down multiple enemies and suppress/kill enemy snipers. Therefore, semi-automatic snipers should sport a \"close support\" role, sticking behind friendly riflemen to quickly bring down wounded or grazed enemies with single shots, laying down suppressive fire against enemy snipers to allow teammates to advance, or to position himself at stratigic points to neutralize a large assault by the enemy team. Unlike the snipers using bolt action rifles, it is inadvisable to \"solo\" or flank using a semi-automatic at the beginning of demolition matches, as any encounter aganist riflemen with full health will lead to high chance of death. However, in these game modes without instant respawn, a marksman who survived the initial onslaught by supporting his team would likely face enemies with lower than 100% hp near the end of the match. Thus, his role as a game changer greatly increases. Semi's tend to have a bad reputation among the player community, particularly when it is used in sniper only matches as it is commonly understood their rate of fire is generally more forgiving than a bolt action. Also, the semi-automatic's limitations and the lack of a large \"designated marksmen\" niche in the community has made the semi-automatic a \"noob\" weapon in the eyes of many, used only by those who bought it without knowing its drawbacks or those wishing to exploit its strength against bolt actions in sniper only games. While few, there are still some marksmen on AVA able to overcome the steep initial learning curve, using them to great effect in demolition tournament type matches. A skilled and dedicated player should never be afraid to explore this class of weapons if he is seeking a challege.Strengths  The Sniper is very good at making fast kills, usually killing an opponent before the victim even knows where the attacker is. If the Sniper's victim does happen to spot the location of the Sniper, the Sniper would do well to relocate to a different spot temporarily.Weaknesses Best Maps/ Settings for the Sniper Class Maps/Team (If given advantage) Game Modes SA58 Para  The SA58 Para is an automatic assault rifle used by rifle men, and is available for permanent purchase with euros or AP in the in-game shop by soldiers of any rank. It is an original as opposed to an upgraded model and/or custom variant; with reference and modifications to a real-life weapon.Overview  The SA58 Para is a very popular standard weapon which is well-known for its trademark style of gameplay. To account for the large amount of skill required to use it; extremely high damage, range, fire rate and armor penetration are all present. Where the focus of this weapon has been heavily set on a large damage output, an expected deficiency in stability and prolonged accuracy is present, which can become more noticeable when faced against multiple targets or at long range. While recoil at longer ranges can be problematic - the high range means that the SA58 Para will maintain damage output over a significant distance, making it easier to secure kills in fewer shots, and subsequently still makes it suited for demolition and other larger, more open maps. Unlike most rifle man weapons that are designed for longer range, engaging with targets at close-range does not give too much of a disadvantage due to the high fire rate and consequential damage output. The SA58 Para has exceptional armor penetration. Even at up to 40 meters, the damage done with a single shot to the head can bring your target down to critical health. Shots landed on any other part of the body rip armor away at a fast and consistent rate. The largest problem is maintaining this weapon's usability in extended fire \u2013 fully automatic fire is not viable unless you are at point-blank range; tapping is the most effective method of securing kills, even at mid-range. Despite having a remarkable damage output, the usability of the SA58 Para does not allow it to endure past other conventional weapons, meaning that you will find yourself shift-walking and crouching much more often than you would with other popular rifle man weapons such as the M4A1 and AK-47. This makes strafing less feasible and potentially makes you a bigger target. This can be offset by tapping fast and landing as many successive shots as possible in the shortest time.Modifications Mounts  High-powered dot sight.Barrels  Increases range and accuracy by using a heavier barrel, but decreases stability and auto fire abilities.

The dramatic increase to range provided by the Long Range Barrel means that fewer shots are required to land to secure a kill \u2013 although the range of this weapon is already very high, this barrel ensures that its versatility is maintained over bigger distances. Head-shots have a very heavy focus, so ensuring you deal the highest possible damage per shot is important.Stability Build  Swapping out for the Spetsnaz Edition will yield a noticeable deficiency in damage, which is observed especially if you have already become used to the Long Range Barrel. However, this set-up is recommended for people who are just starting out with this weapon, or those who find it difficult to control the recoil associated with it. Despite the huge increase to auto fire accuracy, you are still advised to tap where possible, as the recoil will still become difficult to control when bursting.Notable Comparisons AK-12  The AK-12, having been released later than the SA58 Para, has been modernized, most notably with an increase to accuracy, stability and range \u2013 seeing the AK-12 used commonly by those who enjoyed earlier iterations of the SA58 Para. Despite the upgrade to usability the AK-12, much like the SA58 Para, still needs to be tapped to maintain control; it is uncommon to see it even be bursted due to the drop in stability. The SA58 Para and subsequent variants nevertheless remain popular due to the higher fire rate \u2013 tapping is made much more effective at mid-range.M14 DMR  Similarly to the AK-12, the M14 DMR was released much later than the SA58 Para, and also sees the same modernization: an increase to accuracy, stability and range. Contrarily, the M14 DMR is actually capable of 2-shot bursting quite comfortably with certain modifications at mid to close-range. At further ranges, again, you'll find that tapping is the most efficient way of handling the recoil. The M14 DMR however also sees a drop in fire rate and has 5 less ammo than the SA58 Para}, which makes it the less favorable of the two for those looking to tap fast.Variants Tips  Tip composed by:\u00a0EUY (in-game name) | Signed: EUY (talk) 01:57, January 30, 2016 (UTC) Tip composed by:\u00a0EUY (in-game name) | Signed: EUY (talk) 01:57, January 30, 2016 (UTC) Tip composed by:\u00a0EUY (in-game name) | Signed: EUY (talk) 01:57, January 30, 2016 (UTC)Trivia  Trivia composed by:\u00a0EUY (in-game name) | Signed: EUY (talk) 01:57, January 30, 2016 (UTC) Trivia composed by:\u00a0EUY (in-game name) | Signed: EUY (talk) 01:57, January 30, 2016 (UTC) Trivia composed by:\u00a0EUY (in-game name) | Signed: EUY (talk) 01:57, January 30, 2016 (UTC)Media Capsule Shop  The Capsule Shop is a server where the player can buy Capsules. Euro Capsules can only be bought at  Staff Sergeant Lv 3 and Aeria Point Capsules (FPS Capsule [A.V.A SEA]) can be bought at any rank with both Aeria Points (FPS Points) and other forms of currency. Battle Points are used to lower the price of Euro Capsules only.New Capsule Shop  The new Capsule shop is an easier shop that sell tickets capsules and Euro jackpots instead of guns, you can still earn Most of the capsule guns by using tickets. Red Tickets are used to buy G-Coin Capsule guns. Blue Tickets are used to buy Euro Capsule guns.List of Capsule Types & Contents Monthly Capsules  Monthly Capsules contain pre-release permanent weapons. They are bought using Aeria Points (FPS Points). Each item has a certain number of capsules remaining out of the total. For example, if a listing says 187/200, it means that there are 187 capsules remaining out of 200. Only 1 permanent gun can be won from the 187/200 capsule until the capsule count resets back to 200/200. Each capsule is guaranteed to contain at least some of the items listed, but not necessarily the weapon you're trying to win. A non-winning capsule might contain a grenade, some Euros, and a piece of armor. The same consolation prizes won from capsules stack. For example, if you win an M67 grenade for one day in one capsule, and again in another capsule, your inventory will show you have an M67 grenade for two days.Euro Capsules Rifle Man Point Man Sniper Secondary Weapons AP Capsules Point Men Riflemen Sniper Secondary Weapons Secondary  Secondary Weapons are used by all classes. Secondary Weapons can be used instead of reloading while engaging the enemy, or when ammunition for the Primary Weapon has completely run out. Secondary Weapons can be classified as one of the following three categories: Pistols, machine pistols (automatic, but with a low damage and accuracy), and revolvers (high damage, but have a small magazine and slow reload speed). Snipers must be proficient with Secondary Weapons because their Primary Weapons are built for long range and not easily adaptable like those of Riflemen. It is generally ill-advised to attempt to use secondaries as a \"primary\" weapons since they tend to have small magazine sizes, but some weapons have proven themselves to be quite powerful in the right hands, particularly the capsule weapons. The Desert Eagle, Beretta 92FS, and TMP have gained much praise for Euro shop weapons. Among Red Ticket weapons, the AUTO 9, Colt SAA and Python 357 are greatly praised. The only secondaries which have gained bad reputations are the P226 and the Skorpion vz 61, and they are not recommended as sidearms due to their relative inability to kill. A list of weapons categorized as secondary weapons can be found on the\u00a0Category:Secondary Weapon\u00a0page.Weapons  Weapons, or known as guns, are the main point of A.V.A. If you plan to get anywhere you need a gun. For a full list of the weapons currently in A.V.A, see this link.General  Guns in A.V.A all have the same rating criteria: Rate of Fire, Damage, Mobility, Range, Accuracy, Stability(recoil), and Ammo(number of bullets per clip). Each class has weapons geared toward the play-type offered by that class (eg. pointman weapons are all smgs and shotguns). All weapons can be customized to some degree, but some weapons (like the M4) have many more add-ons than others (like the AK47 or the M16). More details on Modifications can be found in Adding Modifications.Pointman  Pointman (PM) weapons are all chosen for their Close Quarters Combat (CQC) proficiency. Shotguns, Carbines, and SMGs are the PM's weapons of choice. PM weapons are chosen for their high rate of fire and mobility rather than damage and range. One exception to this is the shotguns, which possess high damage, though at the cost of firing rate and range. SMGs are used in close to mid range fighting where high rate of fire is more valuable than accuracy. Examples include the AKS-74U , Benelli M1014 , FN TPS , \u00a0K1A1 Rail , Kriss Super V , MP5SD5,\u00a0SPAS 15 , SR 2M Veresk and the Training MP5K, the default PM weapon. The most popular weapons are the X95R and the MP7A1Rifleman  Rifleman (RM) weapons are excellent for mid-range firefights. RM weapons form a very broad category and attempt to mix the accuracy and range of the sniper rifle and the rate of fire and mobility of the submachine gun. Usually, the higher the damage, the less stable the gun becomes (especially in sustained fire) although with most guns, recoil is easy to handle though tapping and bursting. RM have the widest variety of weapons, and are arguably the most popular class in all of AVA. While this is not necessarily the most effective class for all scenarios, its the most widely used. Examples include the well-known AMD65 , FAMAS MK.3 , M4A1 , OTs-14 Groza , Remington R4 , XM8, SA58 Para and the most popular weapons are the AK-47, Diemaco C7A2, and AK-12 .Sniper  Snipers excel in long range to medium range fighting looking down the scope of their rifles, preferably from someplace high and hidden. Close range effectiveness is severely limited by sniper rifles' (often) slow rates of fire, general combat incapacity when not scoped in, low mobility, and limiting tunnelvision while scoped in. In exchange, all of the sniper rifles (SR) have extremely high damage and often high range, and have a variety of scopes which can emphasize mid range combat (quickscope) or long range to better fit the players playstyle to use these traits to their highest capacity. Quality sniper rifles are often hard to judge as factors not listed in the stats come into play, like the time it takes to scope in or the time it takes to pull out (for quickswitches). Snipers are the second most popular class to use in AVA. It is not uncommon to see the majority of the players on one side using the Sniper class. They also have skills that decrease the draw time and reload time of their pistols \u00a0and increase their pistol's reserve ammo. This is crucial in quickswitching and in close quarters combat. Examples of Sniper Rifles include the ASW.338 , AWM , Blaser R93 , HK417 Sniper , Knight SR25, TPG1 , VSS \u00a0and the default Training R93 . Currently the most used snipers are the M40A5, FR-F2, DSR-1 and the M1903A1Modifications  Many of the weapons in the game can be upgraded with new sights, barrels, grips, and trigger caches, some weapons more so than others.AWM Overview  The AWM is an upgraded version of the old, AWM Origin & AWM MK.3. Compared to the original two, it has higher ATK, Range and Swap AutoFire. The exterior of the gun has almost been completely remade. It's main colour is a light brown (compared to the grey on the originals), it also features a longer bipod in the front and a larger, more \"beefy\" scope mounted on the top.Modifications Mount Barrel Trigger Grip Stock Recommended Builds  The player should always use the .338 Lapua barrel to maximize the kill rate of the weapon. The Sharpshooter Scope is also recommended, as it's the fastest sniper scope in the game. Moving mode trigger is very expensive at 5,000 euros, but should be used Grip and Stock upgrades are unnecessary as the difference is entirely negligible.One Hit Kill\u00a0%  Notes: 14 Armor equipped 10 shots per distance Shot at the arms Barrel: .338 Lapua Barrel\u00a0 AWM MK.2\u00a0Variants Trivia TPG-1  The TPG-1 is a Sniper weapon released during the Aeria to En Masse transition.Overview  The infamous TPG-1 is considered one of the only \"true\" one-hit-kill sniper rifles, with a base damage of 115 which can be upgraded by using the Lapua Magnum to 130. Although it has extremely low mobility, RoF, magazine size, and ADS time, the TPG-1's weaknesses are usually overlooked simply because of it's raw power and accuracy. One of the main hindrances of the TPG-1 against other sniper rifles is it's agonizingly slow scoping speed. This can cause the user to lose firefights during Sniper-only games because every other sniper in the game has a faster ADS time. Because of this, it is recommended that the user \"hardscopes\" when attempting to get kills. However, hardscoping also has major drawbacks including limited visibility, difficulty hitting laggy players as well as lower mouse sensitivity until you scope out, but even so, this is usually negated if one is used to the sensitivity of their mouse. If, however, your opponent misses his/her first shot, it is highly recommended NOT to quickswitch (QQ) if you also miss your first shot because the game will automatically re-scope the TPG1 almost 3 times quicker, granting you the possibility of killing the other player, especially if you are within close range and cannot find cover. This version replaced the old, outdated TPG-1 Origin during the Aeria to En Masse transition, boasting a higher overall performance.Modifications Mount Barrel Trigger Grip Stock Recommended Builds Variants Trivia FR-F2 Overview  The FR-F2 is one of the most popular sniper rifles. Although the TPG-1 is considered supreme for it's almost 0% tag rate, the FR-F2 seems supreme in all other categories. One of the more significant reasons as to why the FR-F2 is one of the most popular sniper rifles is the fairly low tag rate, despite the rather fairly average damage. The reason behind the low tag rate is the armor piercing stat of 97, the highest of any gun, as opposed to 70 on most other sniper rifles. Note that weapons like the SA58 Para and XCR Kraken have armor piercing stat of 65 as a reference. The FR-F2 has an excellent 1 hit KO rate, shots to the chest within considerable range are almost always kills, as it has armor penetration (ignores the armor players are wearing). The mobility, scoping speed, and ammo capacity are all higher and faster than the TPG-1. However, the FR-F2 is not as advanced in penetration of walls or bodies as the TPG-1 is. The FR-F2 also has a higher rank requirement, Master Sergeant, but is worth the wait. The FR-F2 is also fairly customizable, where it can be upgraded and modified further to your preferences. For decreased tag rate, it is recommended to buy the Long Range Barrel (even though that the range stats are misleading, the \"real\" range is over 90). Nonetheless, it is quite common among higher ranks in the PVP channel and on the Canon AI mission, where enemy snipers often are seen carrying it. Overall, the FR-F2 is almost indefinitely one of the best sniper rifles in the game, and a sniper would most certainly do well if he had one. Another advantage is the FR-F2's silence. Compared to the TPG-1's trademark firing sound, the FR-F2 is not so obvious. This is not so useful but may assist in keeping yourself hidden (especially behind enemy lines). The FR-F2 is commonly used by bots in \"Canon [AI] Demolition.\"Modifications Mounts Barrel Trigger Recommended Builds  FR-F2\u00a0was nerfed and is tagged a lot. This build will reduce tag-rate and help with quickscoping. Rifle will gain 7.1 Range, 5 Ammo and quicker scope. If you want to keep stability high, then do not add Magazine Replacement.One Hit Kill\u00a0%\u00a0  Notes: 14 Armor equipped 10 shots per distance Shot at the\u00a0arms Barrel: Long Range Barrel\u00a0Variants Tips Notable Comparisons  L96A1 ASW.338 FN PSR BallistaTrivia Media AK-47 Real World History  The most prolific firearm of the 20th Century, the AK family is the most widely produced and copied firearm in history. Created by a wounded tank sergeant during the midst of the Second World War, it reached widespread fame due to its cheap and reliable design. It spawned an entire family of firearms, ranging from the AKM to Saiga shotguns, and inspired an entire generation firearms based on the same design principle. Introduced in 1959, the AK got a face lift with the AKM. The \"modernized\" AK went through several design improvements. Compared to the original, machine milled receiver, the AKM featured a stamped steel receiver, optimizing it for mass production. The cheaper means of production has been replicated worldwide, propagating the AK design around the world. It's iconic shape has been as symbol of both freedom and oppression around the world. Unfortunately, fears of communist invasion during the height of the Cold War has given the AK the \"bad guy's gun\" reputation that we are all familiar with within the U.S.. While powerful, the 7.62x39mm cartridge lacked accuracy and range. The slow and heavy projectile, combined with the already cheaply produced firearm, meant that the AKM suffered severely at range compared with western NATO firearms firing the 5.56x45mm. In response to the NATO standard cartridge, the AK74 entered service in the late 70's, replacing the AKM, and remains the standard service rifle of the Russian troops today. Essentially the same gun, the AK74 fired the smaller and faster 5.45x39mm cartridge. It featured higher accuracy than the AK47, sacrificing the legendary stopping power of it's older brother. Ironically, while variants and copies of the AK47 can be found around the world, \"true\" AK-47, are extremely rare, especially in the U.S..Overview  The AK-47 is the third remake of the rifle with the same name (after the MK.3 and MK.4). It was originally released in Open Beta of during the Aeria to En Masse transition as one of the first euro-metered weapons. Compared to the MK.4, nearly all the stats are the same, excluding damage which received a buff of 1 point.AK47 Recap  The AK-47 is easily recognizable due to it's mixture of stamped steel and wooden external components, and it's shape. It features high damage for an Assault Rifle, moderate recoil and a comparatively low rate of fire. It is a tad heavier than other Assault Rifles, but the player is still able to achieve moderate speed when sprinting. The AK-47 fits a variety of roles very well:Modifications  No modRecommended Builds  No modVariants Tips  It is recommended to fire in 2-3 bursts and aim for the head when using this weapon at medium to long ranges, while fully automatic volleys(8-15 rounds) are recommended at close to medium ranges. But this gun is one of the most liked guns for low ranks due it's high damage, along with the M4A1 and AK-47 this is definitely the most used gun for low ranks and the AK-47 especially for the people that have multiple accounts thus making them experienced can tap (single firing to reduce recoil) this weapon and aim for the head, thus killing faster than the M4A1.AK47 Debates  There has been much debate over whether or not the AK-47 is a weapon for newbies. People often criticize the AK family, but it is usually only because they are some of the most powerful rifleman weapons in the game. Their high power and fairly high accuracy, aside from their popularity in the real world and in other games, have made them well known in the A.V.A. community.Notable Comparisons  A \"fully upgraded\" AK-47 feels\u00a0like\u00a0a slower ROF version\u00a0(no mods) M14EBR.\n A \"clean\" (unmodified)\u00a0AK47\u00a0feels like a\u00a0slower\u00a0ROF version of the \"modded\" AK74M (Reinforced Barrel, Veteran Mechanism, Light Stock) (Note the actual \"tap\" stability/accuracy of the guns feel\u00a0extremely similar with these configurations)Trivia Media HK416  The HK416 is a Rifleman weapon first introduced during the 06-24-10 Content Update.Overview  The Heckler & Koch HK416 is a masterpiece made by the H&K company. It is a modified version of the Colt M4 with many changes, most notably a new gas operating system from the H&K G36. This gun is not frequently seen because of its problematic bloom(If fired on for too long) and inconsistent damage, but is praised for its superior accuracy and stability while moving. This rifle's incredible accuracy also requires little use of crouching. This weapon is extremely potent in close quarters, where one can take advantage of the moderately small spread and high ROF by bursting at an enemy's head. However, It has substandard penetration against all armor types, which causes it to take more shots to kill at all ranges compared to the M4 variants. The 416's ultimate weaknesses are its bloom when moving, and 'jumpy' recoil caused by the fast ROF. Both hinderances makes it extremely difficult to headshot past 10-13 meters consistently. Using EG08 gloves will help reduce crosshair spread while move-shotting, which may nullify some of the spread issues. Even though recoil is mostly upwards, the first few shots will still kick. However, if you are decently skilled with staying on target and bursting, you can use the 416 to its full effect. It's bloom recovers quickly which allows for rapid bursting. The HK416 will take anywhere from 4 to 7 body shots at close to medium ranges to kill.Verdict  This is great rifle to use for one to hone their skills before use of a M14EBR or SA58 Para while its forgiving accuracy, recoil and firing provides a great alternative to many popular rifles such as the M4A1 Mk. 3. While on par euro-wise to the Sako Rk.95, this rifle is much more accurate, and its recoil is much more forgiving. However, with this comes at a cost of range and this limits its actual effective range. Be prepared to have to frequent close combat situations.Modifications Front Mount Barrel Recommended Builds Burst build (+4 Accuracy, -2 Mobility, -1 RoF)  With this build HK416behave like M16A2, has high accuracy but bad move-shot.

Have high DPS but really bad spray capability. It is recommended to burst or tap.Variants Tips  The HK416 is not recommended past medium range, for even single shots cause the crosshair to jump up, making it extremely inefficient at long ranges. At close quarters, this is usually unnoticed due to the proximity of the enemy. At medium ranges, it is more difficult to use the weapon, as the recoil begins to hamper one's ability to aim. Using a scope is extremely helpful at these ranges due to only minor scoped recoil.Notable Comparisons  M4: If the M4 had a reinforced barrel option, it would turn into an HK416. AK74u: With high DMG but low range, this feels like a bigger brother of the AK74u. C7a2(burst barrel): while the HK416 is more \"accurate/less stable\" then his \"brother from a Canadian Mother\" their gameplay style is very similar.Trivia Media M4A1 Origin  The M4A1 is a Rifle Man weapon.Overview  Well-known as the combat rifle/carbine of the United States Delta Force and Navy Seals(despite critical shortcomings), the Colt M4A1 carbine has been praised for its lightweight build, portability, modularity, and excellent control. The\u00a0M4A1 is currently replacing older M4 carbines in the United States Army for the next recent years.\u00a0Developed off of the M16 family of rifles it is a variant made for close quarter urban combat. Although it is less accurate then the actual M16/A1/A3 because of it's shorter barrel it's still a decent if not okay carbine to use. The M4A1 is available only to the Riflemen class. It is easily one of the most common assault rifle in AVA and is apreciated by players of all ranks. The M4A1 scales well because of its excellent combination of moveshot,rate of fire and accuracy making it a very effective weapon at medium and closer ranges. The M4's effectiveness is curbed for balance by its' low damage, average range and bloom. Still being overused, it was also nerfed several times. At close range, it takes approximately 5 shots to the torso to kill. For the first few bursts, the M4A1 is a very stable gun. It is generally inadvisable to shoot it on fully automatic, as the recoil and spread can get out of hand. At longer ranges, the recoil must be tamed with 2-3 shot burst fire. Being of the M16 family of guns this weapon should be tapped/2shot bursted for ranges greater then 5 meters to negate bloom and minimal recoil. Like other M16 guns the scope can be used while moving if controlled as stated before. Being of Ducky rank, it is one of the few rentable weapons in ijji AvA. Due to the January 29, 2014 Patch, this gun is now unavailable in the shop.

M4A1 has higher Accuracy (65 to 60) higher mobility (55 to 50) and a MUCH higher RoF (67 to 55). It also can be modded to a greater extent than the M16A2. Since the damage is roughly similar but the RoF is dramatically higher, the M4A1 has a higher DPS. The M16A2 has higher Damage (35 to 32), higher Range (45 to 42), higher stability (55 to 52). They share the same clip size (30).Trivia SG556  The SG556 is an Assault Rifle first introduced during the 03-24-11 Content Update.Overview  The SG556 is part of the 'SG' series of weapons. As such, it has high accuracy; however, this model also has rather high damage which can be upgraded almost to the level of an AK47, fairly quick mobility with an average range and slow rate of fire. The weakest point of the SG556 appears to be its accuracy, especially when move-shotting. It is comparable to the M16, but has very little bloom when shooting at a stand still, or crouched position. It also offers a large variety of modifications, having a substantial amount of barrels to choose from. The fact that the SG556 has incredibly low recoil, combined with high crouching accuracy and nice range, allows it to effectively kill enemies at long range. The SG556 is best used when crouching and shooting in 5-6 round bursts. It has horrid moveshot and should only be used as a stand-still weapon; it is also not recommended for rushing, while being great for defense. When fighting in close-quarters-combat (CQC), it is best to just full auto the gun. Although the SG556 has its downfalls, ultimately it is an extrememly powerful assault rifle if used efficiently.Modifications  Mount Barrel Trigger Grip StockRecommended Builds  A recommended and most common mod is with the Long Range Barrel II, Prototype Grip and optionally the Recoil Control Stock (the RCS increases bloom slightly). The Advanced Trigger or Veteran Mechanism adds sideways recoil, but it improves the move-shot. Another not-so-common mod is with the Reinforced Barrel; it allows the SG556 to kill in 3 shots to the torso, opposed to the default 4. Unfortuantely, the barrel also adds sideways recoil, thus causing this mod to be less commonly seen. It is recommended to use the Prototype Grip and the Recoil Control Stock if using the Reinforced Barrel.Burst Mod  This mod makes the SG556 useful at all ranges, while causing little or no penalty to the crouch-shot. it makes the burst fire possible while moving, therefore, more deadly. Burst Barrel is chosen over the Long Range one because the rof compensates even at longer ranges, therefore making the gun more deadly in cqc. The trigger is also recommended because it makes burst fire more accurate while moving (useful at close to medium ranges where you should move while shooting). This is an essential component because it gives you the laser crouch-shot. Also contributes to the accuracy of the burst-fire while moving.Variants Gallery G36  The G36 is an Assault Rifle originally released when the game was, back in 2009.Overview  The G36 is extremely inaccurate, and unstable. While its power and stability are average for an assault rifle, it has somewhat decent accuracy and range. However, it has a slower rate of fire than some of the other rifles and it side to side recoil is very difficult to control when used in fully automatic fire rates. Even with the railed version, this gun is most often meant to be used as a tap or burst gun. Bursting should be no more then 3 rounds, as the recoil will cause a large number of shots to miss. The G36 has a custom intergrated scope which is not used by any other assault rifle, though it is lost once upgraded to the G36 Rail. This is the same rifle which is featured in the tutorial level. It is also much more expensive to maintain than a G36 rail, probably because it does not use modifications.G36 Rail  For 3000 euros players can modify the G36 to make it a G36 Rail. This takes the integrated scope off of the G36 allowing players to equip it with modified scopes (red dot, dot sight etc.) and other modifications. It also decreases repair costs, but increases recoil, and slightly increases spread.Mods Front Mount Barrel Trigger Grip Stock Variants Trivia PGM.338  The PGM.338 is a Sniper Rifle first introduced during the 08-17-11 Content Update in pre-release capsules.Overview  Ever since the TPG1 got nerfed, the PGM.338 became, on paper, the most powerful Sniper-Rifle in A.V.A. The PGM.338 was a highly anticipated sniper rifle with the first appearance of the .338 Lapua Barrel 2 mod, which will rack up 114 points of raw damage, surpassing the TPG1's long standing 110 damage per shot. The PGM.338 also has a faster scope speed thanks to scope mods and the possibility of using a precision scope instead of the high magazine for close range combat or quickscoping. However, PGM.388 also regains the dreadful trait of auto-zooming after every shot, which leads to Quick-Switching for a faster ROF and total Mobility. The sniper rifle is designed for very long range combat by default because of the scope's high magnification; therefore it is 'easier' to aim at enemies who are farther away. This sniper rifle is one of the 'true' snipers, in that all of its statistics are focused on ones that are important for snipers: damage, range, and accuracy. The PGM.338 can be modified for nearly 100 accuracy and be modified to 114 damage. It also has high range to boot, so this weapon's main purpose is sniping from a distance. It also has a really high price at 59,000 euros, but for its unbelievable strength and range, it is worth the price.Trivia Modifications Mount Barrel Trigger Grip Recommended Builds High RoF similar to FR-F2  With this build\u00a0PGM.338\u00a0becomes similar to the FR-F2 in RoF. The PGM.338 gains\u00a015 Damage, 3 Range, 1 RoF and 1 Accuracy\u00a0in exchange of 3 points less stability.One Hit Kill\u00a0%  Notes: 14 Armor equipped 10 shots per distance Shot at the arms Barrel: .338 Lapua Barrel 2\u00a0Variants Tips Trivia DSR-1  The DSR-1 is a Sniper Rifle first introduced during the 02-24-11 Content Update.Overview  The DSR-1 is a sniper rifle that, despite being seemingly massive, has the highest mobility rating in its class. The DSR-1 has overall very high damage, a fairly mediocre-quick scoping speed, acceptable accuracy, acceptable range and the default ammo capacity for a 1 hit KO weapon. The DSR-1 is also a weapon which is only purchasable for euros at the rank of Master Sergeant 1. Considering that the tag rate on this rifle is higher than the FR-F2 which has lower damage and range, it could be assumed that its stats are false. There are reports that the standard M24 with the upgrade kit tags less than the DSR-1. It is recommended that players use only the stability stock along with their choice of barrel and scope. The Long Range Barrel 2 will decrease the tag rate overall, however it also substantially decreases the accuracy as well. The Reinforced Barrel 2 increases accuracy as well as damage, but will tag more than the Long Range Barrel. Stability is not of too high importance due to the fact that the DSR-1 is a bolt-action sniper rifle. Nonetheless, the DSR-1 is quite popular, because of its fairly low tag rate, scoping speed and mobility and is often seen(along with the FR-F2 ) being wielded by higher ranks in the PVP channel. Compared to the FR-F2(which is unlocked at the identical rank) the DSR-1 has higher mobility, higher damage, approximately equal scoping speed(by default), more range and identical magazine size but lower accuracy, ROF and stability. The DSR-1 also quite expensive and costs almost 10,000 more euros than the FR-F2 which is why some players buy the FR-F2 instead. This weapon is used by Bots in \"Canon: [AI] Demolition\". Surprisingly, despite the Mosin Nagant being allegedly the quickest QS rifle, the DSR-1 seems faster when quick-switching.Modifications Mount Barrel Grip Stock</u> One Hit Kill\u00a0%\u00a0  Notes: 14 Armor equipped 10 shots per distance Shot at the\u00a0arms Barrel: Long Range Barrel\u00a0Variants Tips Notable Comparisons M40: Mosin: Trivia Prison Break (Survival) Summary  Prison Break Survival\u00a0is a co-op mission that involves either 1, or 4 players surviving in a \"Prison\" as more, and increasingly difficult prisoner NPCs spawn.

It uses the same cartridge (the 7.62 x 39), but is more stable than the original due to a balanced recoil system similar to those implemented in the AEK 971, AK100 series, and the new AK12. Interestingly enough, its predecessor used the AK74 cartridge (the 5.45 x 39), but the designers decided to switch back to the 7.62 x 39 bullet due to its power and accuracy.Overview  The Sako is a high damage, balanced assault rifle, possessing great damage and predictable moveshot. It possesses great flexibility because of its ability to fight anywhere from CQC to medium ranges. Depending on the mods, the firepower, recoil and bloom recovery are interchangeble, making it limitedly customisable to fire in short bursts or tapping. The Sako features an abnormally high ROF for a weapon of such high damage resulting in very high DPS at the cost of some control. The weapon's fast reload can open your chances over your opponent in fast-paced firefights or engagments where you are outnumbered. Tap shooting can be extremely effective when using Burst Barrel and Recoil Control Stock. It is recommended that if going with this build that you change to an 800x600 resolution as the bloom looks reduced which can improve your confidence with the gun and it generally makes aiming easier. You should never Burst with this gun and should only spray when you are less than 2-3m away. First bullet accuracy is good with this gun so headshots are extremely easy.Verdict  Very cost effective, has the most stability in its tier of high power, long range capable weapons. Is a great investment if you are looking for a a more CQC version of the venerable AK47 or an easier to use alternative to the Para, Kel Tec, or M14EBR.Modifications Barrel Grip Stock Recommended Builds AK Style Mod (+2 Range, +1 Accuracy, -1 Stability, -1 Mobility)  This build makes the Sako behave like an AK but with a higher RoF.Para Style Mod (+2 RoF, +1 Stability, -1 Accuracy)  This buildmakes the Sako behave similar to a SA58 Para.The Best Tap Mod (+2 Rof, -1 Accuracy, +2 Stability, -1 Mobility)  This mod is best suited for taping. The Shock Absorber stock shouldnt be used because it only gives you 1 Accuracy in exchange for 1 point of the precious Stability. The Weight Grip really helps with the recoil control, and it also gives you a great aimed-fire. The Burst Barrel allows you to tap more\u00a0 frequently, and gives you slightly more shots per tap. The Recoil Control Stock reduces sideways recoil of the 1st shots.Unmodded  The Unmodded version is best suited for new players or people trying to get the hang of the gun, as it reduces Recoil and Spread, but accuracy is not quite on par with most assault riflesTips Notable Comparisons M4A1 MK.3  Sharing the rank to unlock with the M4A1 MK.3, one could think of this gun as a good option. A skilled shooter can gun down his opponent faster with this weapon due to its superior firepower and rather predictable (albeit bouncy) recoil.HK416  With same unlock rank, most players are stuck choosing either the HK416, or the Sako. The HK bears similar, although slightly less, recoil, and has a scope. The Sako also blooms MUCH faster, even though they both bloom quite rapidly. The HK has more sporadic damage, and can be unpredictable. The HK is also more stable but they share the same accuracy.Trivia Media FN-F2000  The Fabrique Nationale F2000 (FN-F2000 in game) is an Assault Rifle first introduced during the 07-13-11 Content Update as a pre-release capsule. In the 08-23-11 Content Update, the weapon was moved to the standard item shop.Overview  The F2000 is a very deadly weapon with low recoil, an average rate of fire, and good moving accuracy. It is available at Sergeant First Class 1 for 58,000 Euros. The standard ammo count is 30/60, 30/75 with the rifleman perk. The training FN F2000 has recently become the default weapon of the rifleman class and sports a ACOG(x4), but this version cannot be modded. The F2000, like the M4 MK3, AK-107, L85A2, and XM-8, can put out a nice number rounds while retaining deadly accuracy and low recoil. After a few quick seconds on full auto the recoil curves to the sides. The gun has a low DPS, putting it at a disadvantage in close quarters. The F2000 features a fast reload, which is a relief when engaging multiple targets. The F2000 lacks many attachments. There is only one scope available but is not recommended. From the choice of barrels, the long range barrel and burst barrel are good options. This gun is a good buy for unexperienced players due to its ease of use. This also results in the F2000 being referred to as a 'no recoil' gun. While it is accurate and easy to use, other riflemen weapons such as the R4, M4 MK3, FAMAS MK3, XM-8, MG4KE, AK-107BIS, and L85A2 are also considered to have little recoil. A more experienced player can also take advantage of its almost negligible recoil. Using the F2000 can score a player easy headshots from a distance, even while moving, providing for quick kills.Modifications Mount Barrel Recommended Builds Close range (+2 RoF, -1 Accuracy) Mid range/Long range (+3 Range) Training F2000  In 2013, the standard default rifle given to new players (G3A3) was replaced by the \"Training F2000\". This model is simply the standard FN F2000, but has an ACOG Sight with the Long Range Barrel on permanently.Variants Tips  This gun is not meant for fast firefights. You will lose. Try to keep a distance, and ALWAYS aim for the head. If you miss the head, the low damage will get you killed. Do not try CQC. This gun is only effective at medium to long range, and is not easy to use when against weapons in the M4 or AK series guns.Trivia Media Weapons  Alliance of Valiant Arms\u00a0contains many weapons: primary, secondary, melee, and grenades (explosives, smoke). The following listed are all documented weapons that have appeared in Alliance of Valiant Arms\u00a0so far. A list of weapons with their statistics, categorized by class, can be found at the\u00a0Full A.V.A Weapons List\u00a0page.M14EBR  The M14EBR is an Rifleman weapon first introduced in the 10-25-10 Content Update.Real World History  The M14 was original design is based off of the WWII US M1 Garand rifle which was a semi auto only rifle that held a 8 round en-bloc clip of .30-06 cal munitions, which changed to the slightly smaller .308 cal. held in 20 or 10 round mags for the M14. The M14 was replaced by the lighter Armilite AR-15 (M-16) during the Vietnam conflict as the standard infantry rifle. The M14EBR and M14DMR as well as the M39 variant are used today by squad marksmen and snipers alike. Its 7.62mm NATO (.308cal.) round is much more capable than that of the 5.56mmNATO (.223 REM), Because of its select fire nature and its usage of a full sized rifle cartridge, it is classified as a Battle Rifle, much like the G3 and the nerfed Para.Overview  The equivalent of a fully automatic sniper rifle,the M14EBR is a bulky, high recoil Assault Rifle , a better alternative to the Para and RFB at longer ranges , but not quite as damaging up close (think euro version of the FG42). The M14EBR is able to kill in 2-3 (more at Sniper range) hits to the chest on average, M14EBR is by far the most powerful rifle after SA58 Para\u00a0and Kel Tec RFB, but M14EBR can be seen easier at Long Range due the small-bloom with 1 shot tapping on longer ranges.and is one of the few Rifleman weapons able to kill in one shot to the head, regardless of what type of helmet the enemy is wearing. The M14EBR also has one of the highest accuracies in the weapon shop, On par with guns like the AUG-A1 and right below the SG550 and 556. The true potential of the M14EBR, however, is hindered by the high bloom it produces when fired automatically, turning many players off from this bulky monster. Nevertheless, should the M14EBR ever be tamed by tapping the gun when fired, it can be one of the most deadly weapons in the entire game which can easily dominate the battlefield, especially against snipers.\u00a0Modifications  Mount Barrel Grip StockRecommended Builds  The bold modifications are recommended , they are the best at crouch/stand shot with slow tappings and using ACOG scope on long range to aim better. When the M14EBR is in the hands of a pro or decent person, this can easily take out snipers within 25-35 meters. Depending on your Tapping/Bursting you have several choices in Full Builds, Try them all: RangeBarrel + Shot Grip + ACOG - The best TAP/SCOPE build. RangeBarrel + ACC Grip + DOT - A more TAP/CQC build. BurstBarrel + RCS + Dot - A Burst/CQC build. BurstBarrel + Acc Grip + SHOCK ABS+ Acog - Good Burst/Scope Build.Variants Tips Notable Comparisons SA58 Para  The M14EBR and SA58 Para are nearly identical in terms of Stability, Damage, and Range, but the two factors that name the SA58 Para as superior are its Mobility (60) and Rate of Fire (65). Despite the insanely high accuracy of the M14EBR, the low mobility and low rate of fire of the M14EBR leave its versatility as questionable, and many players ultimately choose the SA58 Para as their weapon of choice. The M14EBR also has more bloom than the SA58 Para even while tapping. Still M14EBR is easier to use for beginners.AUG-A1 and AUG-A3  The relatively average stats of AUG-A1 and AUG-A3 leaves them as unpopular, even with the high accuracy both models strut. Even so, the AUG series guns struggle at taking down enemies at long range thanks to its low damage, while the M14EBR easily takes down multiple foes with an average of 2-3 shots, leaving the latter as the superior weapon at longer ranges.Kel-Tec RFB  Seeing as the RFB is a para clone with a HARD GRIP, M14EBR's advantages over Kel-Tec are range, accuracy and stability. Kel-Tec is a para with the stability shifted to nullify the 1 shot's recoil, making the following shots degrade horrendously, where M14EBR is a long range/defense gun best behaving at medium/long range. Both have same magazine capacity (20 rounds). Kel-Tec is unlocked at lower rank but costs 5,000 \u20ac more. Both are headshot oriented, but RFB is more CQC\u00a0 If you're perfect head-shot machine use M14EBR instead, if not Kel-Tec can be a better choice.Trivia Media Prison Break (Lockdown) Overview  Lockdown is an AI mission where a team of 4 players is locked inside a prison facility and must kill all enemies in order to move on into the next wave. Each round starts off with one gate opening, and eventually progressing to all gates being open. Toward the end of a wave, boss enemies emerge, armed with better weapons and much more HP than their minion predecessors. The round will automatically end if all the boss enemies die, even if their minions are still alive. At the end of each round, the team recieves a Mysterious Green Box.Modes Pick-ups  Ammo - Boxes of ammo are randomly dropped by enemies upon their death. Green ammo boxes supply the player with one, Blue ammo boxes supply the player with two extra magazines of ammo for their primary weapon. Health - First Aid Kits are randomly dropped by enemies upon their death. Each First Aid Kit replenishes near half of the player's health. Mysterious Green Box - After each round completed, the team is rewarded with such a green box. At the end of the game (either completion or wipe-out), rewards given to players are determined by the number of green boxes the team managed to collect.Enemies  Standard - Blue prisoners armed with knives, clan knives, food plates, maces, etc. These enemies are extremely easy to kill and can sometimes die from a single shot. The only danger they pose is when multiple blue prisoners attack, surround, and mob the player. Advanced - Orange prisoners armed with fire axes. These enemies take more shots to kill and cause more damage when they attack, but are slow, as they are only walking. Swift - Yellow prisoners armed with shovels. These enemies move faster than all other enemies, and can be extremely deadly if not dealt with quickly. Boss - Black prisoners armed with shovels, pistols, shotguns, and even grenades in the later rounds. They have the most HP out of all the enemies and players must work together in order to take them all out.Rewards Easy  The player will not recieve any euros when completed for the first time and the rewards are completely random.Normal  When Lockdown is beaten on Normal, the player will recieve 5000 Euros for their first completion and any other prizes recieved from the 6 green boxes collected.Extreme  If Lockdown is beaten on Extreme mode and all 26 green boxes are collected, the players are rewarded with a medal which gives 20,000 Euros. This is only a one time reward, as medals can only be earned once. Players also recieve 5000~6000 Supply Points (based on how many rounds they managed to stay alive, recieving an Endurance Badge for each) and a Desert Eagle Silver for 30-days. Unlike the medal, these rewards are given each and every time Extreme mode is completed and all 26 green boxes are collected, and the timer on the Desert Eagle Silver stacks up, adding another 30 days each time. Other prizes include a Viper Mask, and Clan Mask all for 7-Days. In Lockdown Extreme you can win:Tips and Tricks  Lockdown in extreme(difficulty) is nearly impossible to win legitimately and even with 8 players (4 players default) as your comrades. There are glitches associated with this map and game mode which can lead to you and your teammates being victorious however, it is restricted to tell you how to utilize those glitches via this wiki. General Tips: Play smart. Don't go spraying your bullets if you know many will miss. Only pick-up health kits when necessary so teammates who desperately need it have easy acess to them. Always keep on them move and watch your back to prevent becoming overwhelmed by enemies. Assist teammates in danger of becoming overwhelmed by shooting their enemies as well as your own. Try to stay away from teammates so that the enemy is divided amongst all players. Have a reliable secondary with a high ammo count to count on during times where you have no more primary ammo or time to reload. As the Pointman: Use weapons with high magazine sizes (such as the Bizon PP-19, M4 Spectre, P90, etc.) to minimize the time between shooting and reloading. Priotize weaker enemies because your large magzine size will take care of a sizeable amount of them. Constantly move around the map to avert danger and distract enemies from your fellow teammates. Attempt to shoot enemies at point blank range to create the most damage possible from your weapons. As the Rifleman: Prioritize enemies closer to you to create the least amount of danger. Shoot more powerful enemies because the general range and power of Assault Rifles allow you to kill them in less shots. Burst/Tap fire in an effort to reduce the amount of reloads performed. Only reload during feasible moments or risked getting mobbed by a swarm of enemies. As the Sniper: Although highly discouraged because of their lack of ability to deal with multiple enemies during a short period of time, the Sniper can shine on teams with 3 other reliable non-Sniper players. It is ESSENTIAL (more so than the other classes) to carry a reliable secondary to deal with close-range enemies. Since secondary ammo is not replenished in this mode, use the secondary with extreme discretion. With your Primary Sniper, however, only shoot when you have a chance to score collaterals on oncoming enemies. Also keep on the move because of your naturally slow movement speed. When bosses emerge, priotize them in an effort to end the round quicker.", "Hyper RPG Wikia": "Hyper RPG Wikia ", "Tabby Cat Guide Wiki": "Tabby Cat Guide Wiki ", "Tabby Cat Special Cats!
