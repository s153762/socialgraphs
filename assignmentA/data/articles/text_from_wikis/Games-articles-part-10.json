It follows the story of Ib, Garry, and Mary in the strange gallery world of the world-famous artist, Guertena.Gameplay  Ib a game focused on exploration and puzzle solving. There are no battles, as is typical with horror RPG Maker games, but there are slight jumpscares. Ib is free and is an excellent rpg horror game.Characters  Spoilers ahead; read at your own risk.Ib  As the titular character, Ib is a silent protagonist who only presumably speaks when asked a question, during a cutscene, or when given a few choices to answer someone although you never see her in the dialogue box as if she's mute, though this isn't the case. She is a brown-haired, red-eyed 9 year old girl. The pronunciation of \"Ib\" has been debated among fans, but according to\u00a0kouri's\u00a0blog, it is pronounced similar to \"Eve\".Garry  Garry is another gallery visitor who is also trapped in the strange gallery. He was attacked and lost his rose by a Lady in Blue painting. His rose began to wither, and as a result, he too became injured. Fortunately, Ib saved him by retrieving his rose, then rejuvenating it in a nearby vase of water. The two joined together to escape Guertena's World. He has a blue rose, symbolic for \"impossible miracles.\" He appears to be older than Ib. Although his actual age is not known, he is thought to be around\u00a018-20 years old. Garry and Ib have a sibling-like bond. Judging by his jacket and his interest in Ib's clothing, Garry is thought to be interested in fashion. It is possible that he's a smoker, seeing as he carries a lighter around, although it hasn't been confirmed. Despite being odd, Garry is thoughtful and kind, often thinking of others before himself.Garry has purple hair with darker purple streaks at the top of his head, as well as black eyes.Mary  A young blonde girl found by Garry and Ib, who joins them in their escape from Guertena's World. Mary is\u00a0thought to be\u00a0about the same age as Ib, she is\u00a0very odd and childish, but clever. She has a yellow rose, symbolic for \"thin jealousy,\" which becomes very clear later on when she spends more and more time with Ib and Garry (she disapproves of Garry's friendship with Ib and wants her for herself ). However, throughout the game the player feels as if\u00a0there's something\u00a0suspicious about her. Garry soon unveils her dark secrets through exploration - Mary is, in fact, not a real human being, but only a painting of Guertena's that has come to life. She longs to escape\u00a0Guertena's World\u00a0and finds that it isn't possible unless she takes the place of\u00a0a human\u00a0in the real world. In a part of the game, she stops\u00a0Ib and ask\u00a0her a hypothetical question that could affect your ending depending which answer you choose. The\u00a0question she asks is \"If only two people could get out, who would you pick?\" If your bond with Garry isn't strong enough, she will obtain Ib's flower in the toy box and to ensure Ib's safety Garry trades his rose with Mary. After running away she will begin to pluck the petals of Garry's rose because according to a book in\u00a0Guertena's world \"the women of this world love\u00a0to play Loves me, Loves me not\" thus killing Garry. \u00a0Endings  Spoilers ahead; read at your own risk.\u00a0 In the game, there are seven different endings (five in the original, and two more new endings in the 1.04 update). Your choices and actions will affect what ending will ensue. Tip: Be sure to save often in different slots, as you'll be able to go back and make different choices if you would like to get an alternate ending.Promise of Reunion  If the player prefers Garry over Mary , then this ending would be considered the best one possible. To get this ending, Ib must give Garry her handkerchief when he gets injured and choose to jump into the painting with him (if you do not have enough bond points, you will not get the option to give the handkerchief to him). After escaping, you can find Garry looking at the rose sculpture. You will speak with him, and he'll subconsciously call Ib by name, much to his surprise, seeing as he believes he's never met her before. As he begins to leave, he realizes he has the handkerchief in his pocket, which will trigger his memory of everything that happened. He'll ask to borrow the handkerchief, as he does not want to return it in its bloodied state. He promises to return it soon, sure that they'll meet again. Ending credits will roll, and a picture depicting Ib and Garry waving happily to each other will be seen.Memory's Crannies  In this ending, Ib doesn't give Garry her handkerchief when he's wounded by the glass shards (either you don't get the option to, or you choose not to). The player will still go through the last stages of the game (choosing to jump into the painting with Garry or to go with her mom). After jumping into the painting with Garry, Ib will return back to the normal world. She can find Garry looking at the rose sculpture. Garry will state that looking at the piece of art makes him sad. He will then tell Ib to disregard everything that he said, walking off afterwards. After Garry leaving, Ib's mother will come down and spot her looking at the sculpture. She will make a few statements and then take Ib to look at other exibits in the museum. Ib and Garry will presumably never see each other again and Ib eventually leaves with her parents.Ib all Alone  Variation 1 Here, the player will make the decision to follow her \"mother\" instead of Garry. It's clear that this is an attempt to keep Ib trapped in the realm, and taking her supposed mother's hand will lead to Garry being the only survivor. After the desicion is made, Ib's mother will disappear. Garry will desperately call out to her, but Ib will appear to be in a trance as she slowly walks off. Variation 2 In this ending, the player sees Garry die (although he's asleep, in Ib's innocent eyes) due to Mary plucking the petals of his rose. Ib will take his lighter (eating the candy to make room), and find Mary destroying the last of Garry's rose. Once Mary leaves, Ib burns the plants blocking the path to a door in the room. After this, you enter\u00a0the room and find Mary's portrait hanging on the wall. Mary will appear, pleading, then demanding, that Ib leave. Angrily, she stalks toward Ib with her knife, shouting for her to stop. Once beside the painting, the player will choose the option, \"Burn down the painting.\" This causes the painting to burn, as well as Mary, leaving only her knife and burnt paper ashes. Once Ib leaves the room, she'll eventually come across the painting that leads to the original gallery. \"Garry\" will then appear, claiming to have found another exit. Much like the first variation of this ending, this is a fake--an attempt to have Ib stay. Ib will decide to follow Garry, and they walk away together, deeper into the realm. Variation 3 If the player chooses to step back and not to jump from Guertena's realm to the original gallery, everything goes dark and Ib gets trapped into the realm. Variation 4 If Garry and Mary die, and if it's the second gameplay on the same save that the player made, in the secret dungeon, the player will find a dark bed. If Garry is with her, he will stop Ib from letting herself fall into sleep, but, if Garry isn't there, the player will fall asleep, and there will be a cutscene of Ib's ninth birthday, where she got her handkerchief, and she will sleep for eternity.Forgotten Portrait  If the player chooses not to follow the fake Garry, then Ib will jump into the portrait. In The Hanged Man's\u00a0(one of Guertena's paintings) place, there will be a painting titled Forgotten Portrait, depicting Garry \"sleeping.\" While examining it, Ib's mother will approach and demand Ib come with her. Ib will look back at the painting once more before leaving the room.Together Forever  If the player prefers Mary over Garry, then this ending would be considered the best one possible.\u00a0After Ib witnesses Garry \"sleeping,\" the player will leave through the pink house without bothering to burn Mary's painting. After jumping from Guertena's realm to the original gallery, Mary will be seen approaching. Ib will eventually find her parents in the gallery's lobby, with Mary standing in front of them, suggesting that Mary has become Ib's sister. She leaves the art gallery with her parents and Mary, and depending on what's in Ib's pocket, Mary will take it away from her (eating the candy or confiscating the lighter). Mary asks Ib if they'll be together forever, and the scene ends with a picture showing Ib and Mary holding hands happily, but this is also odd that she did not see the Garry painting.Welcome to the World of Guertena  If the player has a high enough bond with Mary, but a high \"doom\" count as well (certain actions you perform in the game will affect both of these counts), you will come to this end. After failing the doll room with Garry, you will automatically go back to being Ib (failing the doll room does not always guarantee a bad end, but it does raise doom points significantly). You may now get the key in the 'black and white' room (which is now in color), and may proceed to the lower level in which Garry was solving puzzles. You go in and gradually progress to the room, hearing Garry talking to himself along the way. Proceeding into the room, Ib finds that Garry is talking to the bunny ornaments (which are actually dolls). On the contrary to what may happen if you have a high bond with Garry or a low doom count, he cannot be brought out of his insanity. Ib stays with Garry and is unable to leave his side, and Mary initially decides to leave them both behind. Instead, she comes back a few moments later and proclaims that she and Ib are friends, and friends don't leave each other behind. The scene then cuts away and back again to the doll room, with the bunnies now as dolls and several other creatures of the gallery in the room (two Ladies in Red, headless statues, mannequin head, etc.). Ib is lying on the ground as she does in many of the 'death' animations, but she is not dead. Garry is also slumped over as he would be in the Forgotten Portrait end, but is also not dead. Their roses are on the ground, withered and with few petals left, while Mary is blissful and introduces them to the other 'artworks' of the gallery as her friends. Mary confiscates Garry's lighter and has the large doll painting eat it, claiming that it should go in the trash. After this, Mary proceeds to exclaim that the three of them can play games and be friends forever. The scene ends with a black screen with the title of this ending.A Painting's Demise  This is possibly the worst ending for all three of the characters, but the absolute worst for Mary. If the player has a low bond with Garry, high doom count, and low bond with Mary, they will find themselves at this end. It proceeds much like the previous ending, up until Mary leaves Ib and Garry behind in the doll room while Garry hallucinates. The player is now playing as Mary. Mary leaves and goes back upstairs to where she and Ib were originally, then goes to the statue and asks it to move. It does so and she proceeds down the long flight of stairs. Skipping the sketchbook, the player ends up back in the gallery. As they proceed to the Fabricated World painting, several messages in paint appear on the walls, telling Mary not to go. She disregards them and goes through the painting to the real world. When she arrives, the gallery is still empty. The player is able to have Mary go around to different parts of the gallery, and when Mary tries to leave, the events that transpired at the beginning of the game for Ib (the gallery's lights going out and the footsteps) happen to Mary. Mary explores the gallery and tries to find a way out, however, things only get more and more demonic. Red leaks from the windows, cracks form in the walls and blue paint starts leaking. Images of Mary being dead appear in the lobby, red letters appear on the floor, and several messages tell Mary that she does not belong in the real world and that she's been 'a bad girl'. The gallery gradually darkens until it's pitch black. Mary exclaims that she cannot see and cries out to Garry and Ib to help her and to save her, but they do not come as they are still trapped. In the end, an unknown force kills Mary and in her last words she cries out to her 'father'. (It is heavily implied that Guertena is whom Mary refers to as father, and that he is the one who killed her. However, this is not confirmed.) The scene ends in that same pitch black and then displays the title of the ending you have received.Download  Ib can be downloaded\u00a0here.External Links Pokemon Crimson Red  A fanmade Pokemon game using the RPG Maker XP to make it.Story  In the region of sinnoh a young tranier with trust in thier pokemon will becom the pokemon leagueCharacters Good Guys  'Main Character: with the choice of three starters which are Earthore, Flamero, and Creewave 'Sasha/Ryan: travels with you, has whatever pokemon weakens yours Amy/Myron: travels with you, has whatever pokemon you weakenLocations  A Pokemon World, of course. swallow town: The starting city where the main character gets his first Pokemon and the biggest city in the ice berge regeon.Gameplay  Same as any other pokemon game New Light-type Pokemon!

He has been searching all along \"The Way\" which is the name given to the world of this game by his childhood friend, whom was separated from him many years earlier. His travels take him to many settlements, he meets a very wide and varied cast of characters, and has adventures ranging from dungeon crawling, to stopping sieges, to tournaments and even some acting! Meanwhile, a mysterious killer wreaks bloody havoc, and dark things stir in the Reaches. As the Way's mysteries are slowly revealed, Rhue follows the trail through mountain and forest and fire--and learns more about himself and the world he lives in than he's ever wanted to know...Characters  Rhue: Known formally as Rhue of Landorin, he is the main character of \"The Way.\" A rather complex character, he is obsessed with finding his lost love Serena, at any cost. While initially weak, he eventually builds up a respectable number of combat maneuvers before the story is over. Strata: An amazingly talented sword fighter, who is first introduced when he robs Rhue. After being left for dead, Rhue steals back what is his from Strata. Strata and Rhue develop a fierce rivalry that spans most of the game, and Strata never misses an opportunity to make Rhue's life difficult. Traziun: A red-haired swordsman Rhue meets early in the first episode. He is quite a talented fighter, and seems to have some connection to the Blood Lyn, an elite group of warriors for hire. His personality is a good complement to Rhue's for the beginning of the game, and he serves as a good instructor for newer players. Gaius: A blue-haired man of mystery who has apparently had past dealings with Rhue. He seems nice enough, though there is some part of him that hides his true intentions. Much like Traziun, he may be a far more powerful fighter than he lets on. Lyrra: A young girl with a love of stories of all kinds. Her passion for fiction, and a very unique and roundabout was of talking, makes her a very entertaining character. Her silly stories though, are her way of blocking out the memories of a painful past. Cetsa A.K.A, Dancing Violet: This unique character is introduced in the beginning of the second episode. She is a pink-haired beauty who delights in getting what she wants from dazzled men. She is also apparently the leader of the Blue Scarves, a fearsome bandit troupe. Kloe: A female Blood Lyn who was contracted out to the foreman of a town named Lide. She is very powerful, quite rash, and more then a little violent. At first she and Rhue hate each other, but over time they grow quite close. Alanthreonus Phillipe Straphachar: Often called simply Alan, he is the rich snob of \"The Way\" universe. His manor of speech is very confusing, even for the player, so Rhue often has no idea what he is talking about. They cross swords once in a tournament in Lide, but after that all their meetings are friendly, even if Rhue can't stand Alan. Kygar: A master fighter that travels with Cetsa to cheat towns out of their money. His skill is far greater then Rhue's when they first meet, but he is bested by Traziun. He appears now and again, always changing sides. Slade: A warrior of justice, known as a Shadow Foot. Slade is viciously powerful and strongly devoted to his cause. Blindly obeying the words of his superiors causes him a great deal of remorse and depression. He also crosses swords with Rhue more then a few times, because both of them are too stubborn to talk. Scatha: A mysterious woman who lives in the reaches beneath the ground. She constantly wears a mask to hide her face. She speaks very harshly of men, which makes her interactions with Rhue when they meet very difficult. Dirk: An elderly man who claims he is a legend on The Way, yet none of the other characters have ever heard of him, aside from Scatha. He is somewhat lecherous, and never takes anything seriously, even the end of the world. Make no mistake though, his knowledge of The Way surpasses anything known by any other character we meet, even if we never see the true depths of his wisdom. Phantom Slasher: A silent killer whose identity is unknown. Appears to be following Rhue.Geography  Stretches: The Way is divided into stretches of land of varying terrain. Stretches are named by forerunners. Wanderers generally choose a Home Stretch to refer to when formally introducing themselves to others. Landorin Stretch: Rhue's refers to this as his home stretch. It was the site of a massacre that forever defined Rhue as a person. The Rolling Mists: All-consuming, legendary fog that supposedly exists at the far front and back of the Way. Some claim they exist to punish those who remain behind, while deterring those who go too far ahead. Janwen: An ancient city said to have been so overcome by evil that it was burned to the ground. Has since found a home in wanderer slang and historical study. Estrana: An enormous city that Rhue encounters halfway through his journey. While seemingly friendly, it has a thriving criminal underground. As Rhue's journey continues, Estrana develops an odd significance. The Lower Way: A network of underground caverns that is more commonly referred to as the Reaches. It is infested with monsters and the lower parts are dominated by a great sea of lava. It is ruled by the Lord of the Reaches, who is apparently very powerful but remains a mystery for most of the story. The Upper Way: The heaven to the hell of the Lower Way. Although it is mentioned several times its true nature generally remains a mystery. The End of the Way: Also legendary. It is said that whoever reaches the End of the Way first will become all-powerful. There are those who say that the End of the Way is very close, but there are still others who believe the Way is eternal and therefore, the End of the Way does not exist.People  Wanderer: Any man, woman or child that exists on the way. They are generally divided into Guided, who follow the will of the Purpose; Strays, who follow their own will; and Settlers, who have forsaken the Way and settled down. Some refer to the settlers as Deserters. There are different extremes of each class. Paradan: Followers of the path of Para. They are extreme pacifists, and sometimes refuse to kill even animals. The Vigilante: Those loyal to the Vigilance Council. They are the Way's police force, and have become a very influential establishment. Elite members of the Vigilance Council are known as Shadow Foots. The Guided: A group devoted to obeying and enforcing the Purpose on the Way, whether people like it or not. Believed to have formed shortly after the destruction of Janwen, they detest settlements. Bitter enemies of the Blana Sera, they are not to be confused with Guided wanderers, their less extreme cousins. Lyn: Warriors committed solely to advancing their combat ability. The Plunge has its origin firmly in Lyn culture. Lyn are classified by ability, from common Plyn to the god-like Pharaphalyn, whose abilities were so great that some now doubt Pharaphalyn ever existed. Blana Sera: Mercenaries that are trained from birth in mysterious Battle Grounds, and contracted out to employers at the age of eighteen. More commonly known as Blood Lyn. They are bitter enemies of the Guided. Blue Scarves: A formidable bandit troupe led by Dancing Violet. Its fame has spawned a look-alike gang in the city of Estrana. Its relation to the Blue Scarves proper is unknown.Music Reception  The Way has won multiple Misao Awards for almost every episode in the series, and its popularity within the RPG Maker community is comparable to that of A Blurred Line. Episodes 2, 4 and 5 are considered to be the best in the series, with 1 and 3 being the least and the value of 6 being arguable.External links  Official Website: http://www.crestfallen.usA Blurred Line  A Blurred Line is a game made with RPG Maker 2000 by Lysander86.Story  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The game starts out in the present time with three people trying to stop a man.\u00a0 After some events occur, the game goes back a year previously.\u00a0 You are in control of Talan, the man from the intro who was trying to be stopped. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Talan is nearly late for work on the day the Director, the most important man in the world, is giving a speech, Talan is called to the office of the Director himself. Talan faints, and after he wakes up he finds himself still in the Director's office. The Director locks the door, and is shot after talking with Talan. Talan is the obvious suspect in the murder, so he flees authorities as a fugitive from justice. Before the Director's death, the Director told Talan to \"seek Paradise\", a community which by contract law, is immune to Agency influence; The Agency is not allowed to walk onto the Paradise property.Reception  The game is considered one of the greatest free RPGs ever, and has been since it was first released in 2001. The only critisism is its maps. (Graphics were never Lysander86's strongpoint.)Line's End  Line's End is the name for the final installment of the game that has yet to come out, after many years of waiting. This has sparked rumors over whether or not ABL ever will see completion. Rumors have also been circulating that Lys was planning on working on ABL on RMXP.Tutorials (RPG Maker 2003)  All tutorials made specifically for RPG Maker 2003Graphics and Sounds QuikSheet RTP  The abbreviation RTP is short for Run Time Package. The RTP is the default resource pack for each maker, containing all the default graphics, music and sound effects for RPG Maker 2000,  2003, or  XP. The use of these graphics is generally considered unprofessional and is usually frowned upon. However, many people have been able to use the graphics proficiently and have created notable games using the RTP resources.Graphics Use of External Graphics  Due to the wide range of graphical styles available to users of RPG Maker software, there are many routes a user can take when deciding on which graphics to use for their game. Examples of such routes are:Types of Graphical Resources Battle Backdrop  These resources are panoramic images, used as a backdrop for battles. These resources are 320x160 pixels in RPG Maker 2000, 320x240 pixels in RPG Maker 2003 and 640x320 pixels in RPG Maker XP.Battle Animations  These resources are used to display a skill or effect in battles. These resources are 640x480 pixel sheets in RPG Maker 2000 and RPG Maker 2003, with each frame of an animation 96x96 pixels in size. In RPG Maker XP, these sheets use 192x192 pixel frames, limited horizontally to 960 pixels and unlimited vertically. The animation frames are not limited to the order on the sheet, and can be rearranged to better suit the user.Charsets / Characters  These resources, known as Charsets in RPG Maker 2000 and RPG Maker 2003 and Characters in RPG Maker XP, are used to display playable and non-playable characters or objects on a map.Specifications Distinctive Styles of Charsets RTP Style  RTP styled sprites are the most common in the community. This is attributable to several things. The first is that the default RTP charactrepresents.Rips  Rips are charsets made from the graphics of a professionally created game. They have some advantages and disadvantages to the standard RTP style. An advantage would be simply aesthetic. Perhaps the ripped sprites you are using better fit your game's tone than the RTP style. Also rips tend to be less common than the RTP style, so they often leave more of an impression on the player. Rips\u00a0: Take a rips from a game with snes or other The drawback is that rips are not original and their is a high chance that some of your players will have played whatever game it is that you ripped from. They are likely to come away from playing feeling that you weren't skilled enough to make your own sprites, or they may have a hard time perceiving your character as a separate creation from the character that originally used your ripped graphics.Tall  As the name implies, they are taller and more realistically proportioned in comparison with RTP style character graphics. Generally people in the community have a higher opinion of this style of sprite than RTP style sprites because of their more \"serious\" appearance and because they are not used as much. It may seem strange that a more attractive style of sprites should be relatively uncommon in the community, but tall sprites have some drawbacks that resulted in them not being used as much. One of the obvious things is that they are rarer than the RTP styles sprites and thus harder to get a hold of, even if you do wish to use them. Consequently it is hard to find enough of a variety of them to make a convincing world of NPCs without their graphics being too repetetive. In addition to this, tall sprites are more detailed and harder to modify to make the graphics represent the character as they look in the creator's imagination. It is also more difficult to take a tall sprite and make poses for its character because the larger sprite is more at risk of crossing the boundries of its individual grid in the charset, and thus being cut off in the game. This is not a problem in RPG Maker XP though, since the size of the sprite is limited only to 640x480 px, which is the resolution of the game window.Chipset / Tileset  These resources are used to display areas or environments within an RPG Maker game. These resources are known as Chipsets in RPG Maker 2000 and RPG Maker 2003 and Tilesets in RPG Maker XP. In RPG Maker 2000 and RPG Maker 2003, these are grids of 16x16 pixel tiles at 480x256 pixels in total. In RPG Maker XP, These are grids of 32x32 tiles at 256 pixels in width and no limit on the height of the tilesets. As a result of this flexibility, RPG Maker XP tilesets are generally larger in filesize than their RPG Maker 2000 and RPG Maker 2003 counterparts.Sounds Music  Category: RPG Maker 2000 can use MIDI and wav format sound files for music. Category: RPG Maker 2003 can use MIDI, wav and MP3 format sound files for music.Sound Effects  Sound effects simulate real life noises and add depth and flavor to a game.Job Class System  A system where a character can gain special abilities, stat bonuses and/or changes in appearance by changing their occupation or martial arts specialty in game. RPG Maker 2000 provided no direct support for this system, instead requiring developers to work out alternate means of implementing job classes. On the other hand, RPG Maker 2003 had a job class tile in its Database.Common Job Classes Warrior  Typically strong, slow and with minimal magic capabilities. As implemented into many RPGs, warriors mainly use a sword, or some sort of bladed weapon. In other cases, a mace, club, ax, and other similiar weapons are used by this class.White Mage  Specialize in restorative magic. In some RPGs, summoning is also added to the White Mage. This is relative to Final Fantasy 9 and 10, however. Also with restorative magic, some also have the ability to add bonuses to characters in battle. They use Rods, and their magic is sometimes used by paladin classes.Black Mage  Specialize in offensive magic. Mainly uses a rod or staff. Sometimes they are seen using knives or even blunt weapons. Their magic is offensive, and sometimes they have the ability to degrade enemy attributes.Thief  Specialize in speed and stealing items from monsters. They are often mixed with certain traits in stealth, and are often using daggers or knives. Their speed is usually the highest of characters.Implementing Job Classes in Rm2k  To create a job system where the character does NOT change a class, is very simple. Simply create the classes in the database, as you would create them as characters. Then, allow the user to choose what class he or she wishes to be, using simple dialogue and events.Job Classes in Rm2k3  Job classes in RPG Maker 2003 work just as easily as in the RPG Maker 2000 Simply refer to that.Final Fantasy XZ Completed Projects (PC)  This page lists the articles of all PC-made games that have been completed and released to the public. Console games do not belong here. PC-made games that have not yet released a demo do not belong here. PC-made games that are active or abandoned don't belong here. The tag to put an article in this category is [[Category:Completed Projects (PC)]]Sim rpg maker  Sim RPG Maker is a tactical role-playing game maker and part of the long-running RPG Maker series, although the name is not a direct translation of the original program.Releases  There have been two versions of Sim RPG Maker. The first was a console version released on September 17, 1998 for the Sega Saturn, the second for the Sony Playstation in Japan only by ASCII. A Windows version, also by ASCII, was released on May 29, 1998 in Japan only. This version was translated to English and distributed via the internet under the name, Sim RPG Maker 95.Gameplay  Games created with this Sim RPG Maker are focused around strategic battles in which players move their units (battle characters) on a graphical field, separate the units, and use the units to attack.  This style of game is classified as a  tactical RPG similar to Final Fantasy Tactics, Fire Emblem, and Ogre Battle. The program is somewhat limited and inflexible in comparison to other RPG Makers. It comes with a run-time package (RTP) with built-in graphics for animations. Custom graphics can be added, but this is more difficult than in other programs from the RPG Maker series. Graphics are limited to 256 colors, which can cause distortion if two graphics with differing pallets are used on the same map. Files must follow a strict naming convention using letters to designate the type of file, followed by numbers to differentiate the file. For example, a walking graphic for a character class using picture ID 007, could be named CA03_007. The first two letters, \"CA\", correspond to \"character animation\". The first set of numerical digits correspond to the animation slot used in the animation editor, slot 03. The final set of numerical digits correspond to the picture ID being used, 007. One advantage Sim RPG Maker has over others in the series is that it does not require the installation of the RTP to run a game created by the program. Only the installation of the game is necessary. However, the graphics can only come in BMP file format, creating larger file sizes than the other RPG Maker programs. A game typically involves several maps, each with a starting event or cutscene, the main battle, and an ending cutscene. In between maps, players can be sent to the camp, where they may purchase items, switch out party members, change equipment, or check stats of characters. Maps can be designed with different objectives in mind. The most common objective is defeating all enemies or a specific boss character. In addition, players may have to survive a set number of rounds, move past a specified location, or prevent specified characters from dying. Some maps may even be used strictly for cutscenes, with no battles taking place. Maps are progressed through linearly, but it is possible to send the player to maps out of order, enabling multiple/alternate storyline forks. It is also possible to send the player to a previous map. A screenshot showing the editor and a typical map.See also References Resources (RPG Maker XP)  This category should contain only subcategories for browsing resources specific to RPG Maker XPRPG Maker XP  The first legally released English PC RPG Maker. Unlike other RPG Makers, you can use it for scripting, and it no longer has a 256 color limit. Whereas RPG Maker 200X had no scripting system and a character graphic size limit, RPG Maker XP features an easy-to-learn RGSS (A form of Ruby with closed-source components) script editor, no character graphic limit (although the maximum size of each graphic is 640X480 due to the resolution of the engine), and allows the use of most common file types. It was released in English mid-2005 and the 30-day trial is available for download at various websites, the most known being download.com, where the purchase is also available. The program costs $60. Before the program was legally translated, a few members of various RPG Maker communities made translations and/or patches. The most famous of these are DynaEmu, who made the first hack of RPG Maker XP, RPG Advocate, who made the most widely-used version, and Dubealex, who created a patch of RPG Advocate's Translation that allowed 4-line messages and a bigger event-script box. Throughout the years, when the legal XP was released, hackers began making key generators, which simulated the purchase of the program. Most of these hackers, however, were too rash in their actions to distribute their key generators, and most of them have already been banned from most RPG Maker Websites for distributing them. Upon the legal English release, many sites (most notorious being rmxp.org) banned distribution of information leading to illegal (hacked) copies of RPG Maker XP in an attempt to show their support of Enterbrain's decision.The Legendary Hero: Journey of Worlds Intro  The Legendary Hero: Journey of Worlds (also known as The Legendary Hero 2) is a sequel to \"The Legendary Hero: The Journey Begins\" game which is made being created by a teenage boy using the RPG Maker XP. This is the second game to The Legendary Hero series which features more playable characters, with four of them being special guest stars, a new type of mini-quests, a new tournament with more events than the prequel, and a few secret boss battles. Also in this game you learn exactly what the VirusMonsters are and what their true intentions are. The original title was called \"Chris the Legendary Hero: Journey of Worlds\".Story  The story takes place right after \"The Legendary Hero: The Journey Begins\" and continues the adventures of the Legendary Heroes Chris and George. The Master of the VirusMonsters has a new plan and it involves the Legendary Heroes and strange off-worlders from their own dimensions. What the VirusMonsters' are planning are started to shred a few lights of their true purpose is as it seems to be connected to something or someone called \"The Legendary One\"... During Chris' time in Magleutix he began reading the legends about the \"Legendary Heroes\". Before the day Nexus sent the letter to challenge him to a duel Chris read something interesting about the \"Legendary Heroes\" in one of Seemore's books: When the days the VirusMonsters strike Magleutix... A Red Wind appear to cut them down... A Blue Meteor came crushing down on them... The Black... The Red Wind and Blue Meteor were the two titles of the \"Legendary Heroes\", but what happen to the rest of the text? And what exactly happen in the battle between the \"Legendary Heroes\" and the \"VirusMonsters\"?Characters The Heroes  Chris: The Main hero of the series. He's back and better than ever and now must stop the VirusMonsters once again and help his new friends to get back home.

The main hero's name is default and can be change to the player's own liking. George: The hero's cousin and best friend who's the other Legendary Hero. After helping Chris defeat both Nexus and DarkBlade, George heads back to Tech City to find that the city has been destroyed and VirusMonsters are roaming around.

George's name is default and can be change to the player's own liking. Shide: A mysterious character that helps the heroes on their way to become stronger and to find a way back to their home world as well as help the newcomers to find a way back home. He seems to know much more than he let's on and has a strange connection with the original Legendary Heroes. Shide's true identity is still a mystery, but he continues to help the heroes and their friends on their way. Just who is he really? Ami: One of the 4 special guest star characters. Ami, a Rock-Star, uses her \"modify\" bracelet to fires energy shots. Ami is from Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi. When Ami first arrives in the Magleutix world Chris shows Ami around the city and does a battle tutorial with her in the Gravity Field. Ami is (a bit in this game) boy-crazy, flirty rockstar girl who begins to mature and to develop into a selfless (and less flirty) and helpful young lady and starts to develop feelings for Chris. Starts off with the highest Bonding Points with Chris. Zatch: One of the 4 special guest star characters. Zatch, a mamodo, that uses his electric spells without his spellbook and book keeper. Zatch is from Zatch Bell! Zatch first encounters Chris (with Ami) in the Demon Forest and helps Zatch fight off the VirusMonsters that are catching him. Zatch is the same as his anime/manga counterpart and enjoys his company with Chris (as his quotes that he is much nicer Kiyo, who is his book keeper and friend) and the two act like brothers. Starts off with the second highest Bonding Points with Chris. Naruto: One of the 4 special guest star characters. A ninja from Konoha that uses kunais and taijutsu with the power of the Nine-Tail Fox or Kyuubi. Naruto Uzumaki is from Naruto. Naruto joins George first before as George saved him from a group a VirusMonsters in Tech City. Naruto stays in George's party for Tech City and the Old Mining Tunnel then joins Chris in Breeze City after leaving the Demon Forest. Naruto is the same as his anime/manga counterpart as he claims to be the #1 ninja from his village. Chris and Naruto get along at first unlike George which Naruto argues that he thinks he's so cool (just like Sasuke). Starts off with a fair amount of Bonding Points with Chris. Inuyasha: One of the 4 special guest star characters. A half-demon that fights with his claws and his father's sword. Inuyasha is from Inuyasha: A Fedual Fairy Tale. Inuyasha joins Chris' party in the Mountain road (after Inuyasha believes Chris was the one who brought him into this world and battles with him). Inuyasha is the same as his anime/manga counterpart. Inuyasha doesn't get along very well with the other party members (especially with Naruto), but Chris tolerates his behavior and gets along well with Inuyasha. Starts off with the lowest Bonding Points with Chris.The Villains  The VirusMonsters: Ancient evil mysterious monsters from another world. They appeared in the Magleutix world 500 years ago and attacked the humans, however the VirusMonsters were stop the Legendary Heroes and sealed away into their own home world for all eternity. The VirusMonsters are ageless immortal monsters with the power of regeneration and other mysterious powers. The VirusMonsters also come in different variants, each deadly than the last.

After being defeated by both Chris and George, DarkBlade has swore revenge to destrot them for this defeat in combat and to show them that a VirusMonster is superior to all other living creatures. Recently after hearing his master's plans, which he never listens to what his master says and doesn't follow his orders, DarkBlade decides to withhold his revenge against the Legendary Heroes and mess with their minds from his master's plans by telling them a bit about what it is. Nexus: A mysterious being that looks like exactly Chris, except with purple skin and red eyes. He has the power to control gravity and seems to be more of a rivial to Chris than an evil villain. At the end of the first game Nexus has join forces with the VirusMonsters and teams up DarkBlade which DarkBlade refuses to have a partner and decides to fight by himself like always, but reluctantly accepts. Nexus is cunning and mysterious who wants to steal Chris's soul, but let's him go all the time. What could be Nexus's true motives be?Future Appearances  The characters in this Legendary Hero game will reappear in the final game with more playable characters and newer features.Locations  Same as the first one, but with more areas to go to and the Hero's Home is taken out: Heaven City: The main city.

The full title of the series is \"Psycho-Political Drama Phylomortis,\" but they are usually just referred to by the last word in the title for obvious reasons. The games were often criticized for their near incomprehensible and ridiculous dialogue and the high difficulty level, but the third game, Phylomortis: Avate Garde, receives slightly better reception than the other two games. One feature found in the two later games of the trilogy is an anti-cheat system. The one in Phylomortis II was more rudimentary, simply causing a Game Over during introductory cutscenes if the game detected that the player had edited the hero's starting level in the editor. The one in Avante Garde was much more sophisticated, scrambling the data on all of the player's saved files if it detected similar edits.Phylomortis  Made with RPG Maker 95 Can now be found in the rare games forum topics at Gaming World (Salt World) and RMN.Phylomortis II: The Triumvirate of Dystopia  The sequel made with RPG Maker 2000. Phylomortis II: The Triumvirate of Dystopia is about the severance of the phylogenetic structure which has held sway since time immemorial. Whereupon the aforementioned structure ceased, many - indeed most - humans transformed or evolved into alien beings and unfamiliar beasts, inherited various traits such as super intelligence, strength, or amorphous bodies. The game opens on the Miniveh Convention Hall, where the main character's father is scheduled to give a lecture on the Symphony of the Harvest - a songshape that has the ability not only of healing crops that have been damaged by the Phylomortis, but also of rejuvenating the soil. Technically it speeds up the ATP synthesis in the Kreb's cycle, but that is another story! After the lecture is given and received, the main character's father, Legate Arrinson, goes downstairs and meets up with a performer who is a fan of his work. As they chat, the performer notices that there are strange men behind Legate carrying bionuclear weapons with Syprin principality ensignias on them. They are later identified as bio-terrorists from a faction dedicated to wiping out shapers - those who control planes of energy unseen. Keene and Konner - Legate's entourage - attack the soldiers but are quickly defeated because of a terrible gas that causes them to become weakened. As the soldiers finish Legate's entourage as well as he himself, a young girl calls to the main character and he is called to an underground room under the Convention Hall. The girl introduces herself as Elsa. She is an psychotic woman who has different powers depending on her moods -- her 'inner child' mood is triggered whenever something scares her or excites her adequately; her 'philosopher' mood is triggered whenever intellectual dishonesty is upon the party or else something causes her to think abnormally deeply about a subject; and her 'rebellious' mood is triggered by anything that pisses her off.Phylomortis: Avante Garde  Like its predecessors, Avante Garde is also made with RPG Maker. However this time, RPG Advocate made it with RPG Maker XP creating a whole new battle system using the RGSS Script System. Unlike its predecessors, it received mild praises for its major improvements and fixes some of the problems that the last two games suffered.Laxius Power III: The Final Terror  Laxius Power III: The Final Terror is the third in the Laxius Power series of video games made for PC by Indinera Falls.Story  Laxius Power III continues the story from where it stopped in Laxius Power II. Random, Sarah, Luciana and Coryool have achieved high-quality promotions and are now the guest of a museum celebration in Metrolia, biggest town of the world. Yet, as they are introduced to the King, a criminal action is intended against a member of the royal court who appears to be the museum ruler. Random offers his help to the King for the investigation, well aware that a success could award him some recognition. What he does not know, though, is that this investigation will lead him to a 14 days adventure against a new species of Demons - the Cenodemons.Characters  Random Pendragon Age: 16 Class: Tyrine Crusader He is the hero of the saga. He became a Crusader after following an Eight Month Curse in Tyrine. He is proficent using swords. He is very intresested on being recognized and famous. Sarah Brandolino Age:16 Class: Suprem Elf of the Sun She is Random's girlfriend. She has the highest rank in the Elven community. She got promoted by her elders by taking a bath in the lakes of Indinera. She likes having fun, sometimes being very imprudent. Luciana Vincenti Age:15 Class: Half-Goddess Luciana is a Half-Goddess, a very high rank for her age. In Fanta, She was secretly trained by her master, Zanbard, to be a Half-Goddess, instead of a Wizardress. Luciana is a very smart girl, being one of the most intuitive party members. She is able to cast powerful damaging magic. Coryool Tallemuyr Age:47 Class: Body Master He learnt to master his muscles in SankT Leona. He is rude and lazy, but he is immune to most magic and makes himself and his comrades invulnerable to death spells.Subsequent appearances  Many other characters appear. Laxius Power III Features a large number of characters. Some of them are: Guanidia (Random's Chamaleon Pet), Herasia (Luciana's Snow Cat), Leanda (Thaumaturgist or Geomancian, depending on the player's desicion), Sandy (An Economist), among many others.Locations  Laxius Power saga runs in Deport, a land (maybe a continent?) full of strange creatures, supernatural and magical powers. The third game runs near Metrolia, the biggest city on Deport. Other places are important to the game, but not to Deport. The Game is completely full of citys and dungeons, since easy dungeons only accessible in first days (like Slime Nest), and dungeons very complex and hard (like Ore Lab). The majority of this places are only for side quests.Gameplay  Laxius Power III features improvements over the past episodes. Original Artworks 3-Parties final dungeon Alchemy system Weaponsmith system ColiseumGraphics  Any credits to give?Music  The whole soundtrack (about 50 pieces) was composed by Indinera Falls, with a couple additions from Anon D and music artists such as Tony Banks, from Genesis. The pieces were recorded in WAV, before being compressed to avoid a filesize too big.Reception  Laxius Power III received a very good feedback from fans - it is often considered the best of the saga. Most of the detractors in the RM2K community did not really change opinion either, although they do admit the increasement of quality from episode 1 to 3. As far as freeware sites go, the game mostly earnt positive reviews. Regardless of what everyone may think, Laxius Power III earned several awards including more than 30 awards at the Misaos.Title and release information  Has anything been released?

But what was awaiting him was the strongest armored forces, with the forbidden super weapon \"EX-ARMS\". So goes the plot description of KNight-Blade: Howling of Kerberos, a thouroughly enjoyable SF game from the makers of RPG Maker XP. KNight-Blade: Howling of Kerberos was one of seven sample games released in the Japanese version of RPG Maker XP. Unlike most sample games, KNight-Blade: Howling of Kerberos has an actual plot (Yay!) and completely customized graphics, which have now been taken time and time again for use in other fan games, etc. At only 18 MB download, KNight-Blade: Howling of Kerberos sports quite a bit of customized graphics and, as many would believe, is not medievial. In fact, it takes place as a sequel to a RPG Maker 95 game about the same characters in the same high-tech setting.External Links  The Download for KNight-Blade: Howling of Kerberos is at http://tkool.jp/products/rpgxp/eng/download.htmlLegion Saga II  Legion Saga II is a game created by Kamau.

He is followed by a dark elf and his companion to capture Nastra's head, who has a bounty placed on him. He meets a Kobold named Fuba who kills the dark elf's companion. Nastra eventually kills the Dark Elf. Nastra eventually joins a rebellion and runs a customizable castle.Locations Gameplay  MOOSA!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The game also has 1 original tune.Reception  Like Legion Saga, it is generally considered a classic. However, it has aged better because it does not use many RTP graphics or music at all.See also  Legion Saga KamauBeginner Tutorials (RPG Maker 2003)  Tutorials made specifically for RPG Maker 2003 which are of a relatively beginner difficulty.Seraphic Blue  Seraphic Blue (\u30bb\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30fb\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc) is a freeware, console-style RPG made by a Japanese amateur game designer Tempura (\u5929\u3077\u3089), also known as Sakaki (\u698a). The game was released over the Internet on 15th May, 2004, and it has since become a popular (yet controversial) Japanese RPG-Maker game. The game features a well-constructed CBS and CMS, complex narrative full of plot twists, a crapload of cutscenes, and somewhat pretentious writing. Before Seraphic Blue, Tempura released, and subsequently pulled back from the web, two epic RPGs, Sacred Blue (made by RM95) and Stardust Blue (made by RM2k). To play (non-translated versions of) Seraphic Blue, you require the legal, Japanese version of the RM2k RTP to be separately downloaded and installed (link). The game folder is about 63 megabytes in size and comes in a compressed form using the LZH archive format. In 5th November, 2006, Seraphic Blue Director's Cut, a re-balanced version of Seraphic Blue with minor tweaks and added content, was released, also developed by Tempura. Seraphic Blue Director's Cut has been translated into English by eplipswich and kumada. It has gone through a number of demos before it was fully released on October 14 2014.Overview  Seraphic Blue appears to be under heavy influence of 90s mainstream JRPGs (like so many RM games) but not without its own twist. Players follow the linear story told through cutscences with occasional breaks wherein feature dungeon-crawling and combat. Cutscenes are usually long, so much so that some of them can last more than an hour. Sidequests are few and far between in this game. Estimated time from start to completion is 50-55 hours. The story is long and complex, and touches on dark and serious subjects like nihilism, suicide, and war. The game offers an extensive in-game glossary which updates frequently as the story progresses. In addition to a Glossary, there is a recap function which allows you to recall events from earlier chapters and a destination option which will show the player where to go next or what to do if they come back from a long time away from the game and are lost. Abundant use of kanji is one of the characteristics of Tempura's writing, which some find to be pretentious and hard to read. Combat mechanics and menus are custom-designed by Tempura and his team, not relying on RPG Maker 2000's default systems. Battles, especially boss battles, can be difficult and may require preparation and strategy. The game, none-the-less, is fairly well-balanced with a gradual learning curve and doesn't feel unfair. Using an elemental ability or spell changes the field properties, this allows the player or enemy to use higher level magic and abilities. The Elements are divided into 5 categories (Fire/Water, Wind/Earth, Light/Dark, Sky, and Break) The first 3 can be removed by casting the opposing element or using higher level magic or abilities that require it. Sky and Break cannot be removed unless through using abilities that require it or magic and abilities that can use or dispel it.Main Characters External Links PC Makers  A category listing of the RPG Makers made to work on a PC.RPG Maker 2000  A computer program that allows you to make your own RPG.

The controversy is largely based on whether or not the distribution is legal or not.RPG Maker is Legal  Many, perhaps most within the RPG Maker community feel that RPG Maker 2000 and 2003 are legal, falling under the same category as anime fansubs. ASCII (now Enterbrain) NEVER gave their blessing to a Russian computer programmer named Don Miguel to create an english version for free distribution. This was a myth concocted by unknown people.RPG Maker is Illegal  However, some in the opposing camp says that the program became illegal once Enterbrain recieved the rights to it. But this was never true, as the program has never been legally downloadable. However it strikes many as being extremely hypocritical to build a site around providing resources for RPG Maker, tutorials to teach people to use it, and a support community only to \"frown upon\" people who actually put the site content to work by using the program!Definitely Legal RPG Makers  Despite the controversy surrounding english language versions of rm2k and rm2k3, it is legal to produce games made by a Japanese version of RPG Maker. Enterbrain has now marketed a legal English version of RPG Maker 2003.A Final Verdict  Because of the controversy and legality issues, many sites dedicated to RPG Maker have ceased offering downloads. It is hoped by many that doing this will encourage Enterbrain to continue making English language releases. Even though the program is not commonly distributed on sites based around it, it can still easily be acquired using a simple Google search.External links Star Ocean: Albel  Star Ocean: Albel is a spin-off the game Star Ocean: Till the End of Time.

The Legendary Hero series is three games long and staring two of the original characters from his The VirusMonster Hunters novel series while almost all of the VirusMonsters villains from the VMH series also returns in this game along with some new characters. The game has been renamed to \"The Legendary Hero: The Journey Begins\", however the game series' second title name will also be \"Chris the Legendary Hero\". The title also includes a Japanese name.Story  Chris is an average teenage until one day a strange light engulf him and wakens in another world called \"Magleutix\". After wandering around in a forest and in a grass plain he finds a city called \"Heaven City\" and stay there. As soon as he enters Heaven City he finds out that he's a reincarnation of one of the two Legendary Heroes who fought against the VirusMonsters 500 years ago and now must find a way back home while figuring out what the VirusMonsters want from him. What can the new Legendary Hero Chris do to get back home and protect himself against the VirusMonsters? Before the game begins, the opening tells a story about another world 500 years ago that was peaceful and all the people were happy, until a group of evil monsters came and ravaged their world. The evil monsters were defeated and sealed away in their world by two brave warriors, known as the Legendary Heroes. Chris comes back from school to enjoy his vacation at home and decides to practice his marital arts. During some of the activates the scene switches to a dark and mysterious where a group of creatures plot against a boy, which turns out to be Chris. After awhile of having fun, a strange light swallows Chris up and is transported to an eerie, mysterious forest. A group of monsters confront Chris, and tells him that there are called the VirusMonsters and are here to bring him to their master, but Chris runs away from them. Chris comes in possession of a strange sword that appeared in his hands, which he uses to fight the VirusMonsters off. Near the end of the forest Chris is confronted by another group and loses, but is saved by a mysterious cloaked stranger telling him to flee to Heaven City. Chris arrives at Heaven City, where he stays most of the time, and stays with Seemore who is the elder of the city and knows about Chris\u2019 legacy as a Legendary Hero and trains him to control his powers. During Chris\u2019 stay in Heaven City, he helps out the people and participates in the Heaven City Tournament. The Master of the VirusMonsters sends the 8 Elite VirusMonsters to fight Chris. The first ones are \u201cThe Big 3\u201d, which he warns them about Shide and his plans to stop him by summoning George into this world. The second ones were \u201cThe Combo Duo\u201d, where they mention that if Chris doesn\u2019t fight him they\u2019ll destroy the only thing in the Magleutix that can bring him back home. The last ones are \u201cThe Shift Brothers\u201d, and they come to destroy Chris and take his DNA and powers (this part isn\u2019t stated in the game about retrieving something from Chris, but this info is canon). After Chris defeats all the 8 Elite VirusMonsters, DarkBlade the Super Elite comes forth to challenge, but attacks Heaven City instead. Chris chases DarkBlade to the Death Forest, after DarkBlade tells him that he send two little brats to the forest. During the chase Chris re-encounters the 8 Elite VirusMonsters, who revel that they can revive themselves over and over again, but are stop by George. During the battle between Chris and DarkBlade, Nova and Amber appear to help, but DarkBlade took this opportunity to pierce Chris in his chest with his energy beam, killing Chris. The people of Heaven City are in crisis, since the VirusMonsters are coming to destroy their beautiful city. Seemore asks his old friend Buro, where he hid his \u201cspecial item\u201d. After locating the \u201cShard of the Magic Crystal\u201d, he uses its powers to revive Chris. DarkBlade brings an army of VirusMonsters with him to attack Heaven City, but Nova and Amber blocks his way. Just as DarkBlade was about to attack Nova and Amber, Chris reappears and battles DarkBlade again. After a long and difficult fight, Chris emerges victories as DarkBlade leaves when Shide and George appear. As Chris heads back to Seemore\u2019s house, a new visitor appears in Heaven City saying that he\u2019s seen Chris at Stone City. When Chris arrives at Stone City, he finds it in ruins. The survivors are afraid of Chris and the Mayor of the city thought he was the same one who attack their city, but wasn\u2019t. He explains that a VirusMonster has the ability to transform into other beings to deceive them and attack them with their backs turned. Upon leaving the city, Chris feels that he should go back to the beginning of his adventure. Chris returns back to the Mysterious Forest, only to sense something familiar in the Grass Plains and goes to investigate. As Chris wanders around in the Grass Plains, a voice from nowhere calls to him. In a flash the voice reveal itself, as someone that looked like Chris. He was no VirusMonster, but had the same aura as one and looked just like Chris. The doppelganger calls himself \u201cNexus\u201d and challenges Chris to fight. Ending in a stalemate Nexus revealed to Chris about who he was. It seems that the Master of the VirusMonsters left a strange emerald called the \u201cVirus Emerald\u201d where Chris would appear and after Chris stepped on it, it shattered Chris\u2019s soul in two, corrupting the other half and changing into Nexus. As Chris returns back to Heaven City, George arrives with a message for Chris, telling him that both DarkBlade and Nexus are challenging them to one last fight. After Chris and George prepare for their battle, they leave to the battlefield to confront DarkBlade and Nexus. After a long and very difficult battle, the two heroes won, leaving DarkBlade and Nexus to return back to the VirusMonster world. 3 weeks later, Chris enjoys the peace in the Heaven City when a letter appears to him from the wind. Chris reads the letter to find out that Nexus is challenging him again to another fight and DarkBlade\u2019s with him too. After reading the letter Chris heads off to meet DarkBlade and Nexus, without saying a word to anyone. After completing certain events, the secret ending will appear after the credits. Secret Ending Story (Revised version only): After 3 weeks has passed, the Master of the VirusMonsters called forth all his Elite warriors and Nexus. The Master explains a bit about his second part of his master plan, where the first part of the plan was to bring Chris and George to the Magleutix world which has been completed. In his second part of the plan was to gather the \"Legendary One's\" essence scatter throughout the world of Magleutix and orders his Elite warriors to search and collect them. The Master explains that they need certain \"special\" souls to awaken the \"Legendary One\" which is why he'll open up the World Portal and summon them here. As DarkBlade and Nexus depart to fight Chris and the Elite warriors left to search for the \"Legendary One's\" essence, the Master says to himself that soon his dream will come true as soon as all three phases of his plan come into fruition!Characters The Heroes  Chris: The main hero of the series.

It is a life simulation game where the player lives with animals, same as the other games (ex. spin-offs). It was released in North America, Japan, Europe, and Australia on November 16, 2008, November 20, 2008, December 5, 2008, and December 4, 2008, respectively. The title boasts a variety of changes and additions to the Animal Crossing formula, including the ability to travel to the City.New Features  City Folk takes advantage of the WiiConnect24 functionality of the Wii console. It also uses a new feature called Wii Speak, which allows players to talk to each other when visiting each other's towns. There are now 64 insects and fish which is an increase of 8 since Wild World, which had 56 insects and fish.The City & New Attractions  This incarnation of the Animal Crossing series features a newly accessible location called the City. The City houses most of the characters that, in previous games, were considered special visitors. These include Gracie the Giraffe and Redd the Fox, among other characters such as Dr. Shrunk and Lyle. This area of the game is available via Kapp'n's bus, and is open all hours of the day. Most of the shops close at 9 PM daily, with the exception of Redd's Store and The Resetti Surveillance Center. The City Plaza also features new characters Phineas the sea lion and Kicks the skunk. Lyle now works in the Happy Room Academy and Shrunk now works at the Marquee next door. The player can now find Gracie in her store, GracieGrace, who is managed by the new character Labelle. The game also features more Holidays, such as; Halloween, Harvest Festival, Christmas, Festivale and many others.Moving  When moving in, the player has two options; to start fresh or to move in as their DS character. Moving in as their character will only keep the Wild World character's catalog and appearance. However, not all items transfer from a Wild World save, such as the Royal Crown. No items, Bells or house size will be ported with the character. If the player has an illegal game storage device, such as an R4 card or a TTDS, the moving function will not work.Wi-Fi  This version of the Animal Crossing series features Wi-Fi capabilities, which was earlier implemented in the previous game, Wild World. This feature gives the player access to other towns, enables them to communicate with friends' towns with letters, and also subjects them to special furniture items sent from time to time from Nintendo, such as Nintendogs statues and the Red Pikmin Hat, which reference some of the company's best-selling franchises. It also allows players to experience another feature, which in-game is the Mysterious Cat. This enables a visit from Blanca, a character who travels via Wi-Fi into towns, which promotes connectivity between players locally and globally. It has no compatibility with its 3DS counterpart.\u00a0On May 20th, 2014,\u00a0Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection\u00a0on the Nintendo DS and Nintendo Wii was discontinued. This terminated the Wi-Fi capability of City Folk.Development and unveiling  The conception of City Folk began during the production of Wild World and was confirmed that an Animal Crossing title for the Wii, then codenamed Revolution, was in development. Katsuya Eguchi, the producer of both titles, suggested that the two titles may be able to link up to one another at e3 2005. In 2006, Eguchi confirmed that City Folk was still just a concept and very little work had been completed. His time was being consumed by research and development of the Wii console. The Animal Crossing team explored ways to involve the Wii Remote. They planned to allow players to use tools, such as the axe, shovel, and fishing rod. They also explored the use of WiiConnect24 in the hopes that a player could visit a friend's town even when they were not playing. The friend could then leave letters or gifts. Additionally, they planned to use Wi-Fi Connection to allow simultaneous play. At this point in time, however, the title was still not playable. In early 2007, Nintendo of Japan unveiled its video game lineup for the coming year. It included \"Doubutsu no Mori\" (\"Animal Forest\"). Having finished the Mii Channel for Wii, Wild World director Hisashi Nogami joined the Animal Crossing team. Later that year, Edge Magazine reported that a trusted source confirmed that City Folk would be a massively multiplayer online game. The publication declined to name the source. Nintendo failed to release the title in 2007. Online publication IGN predicted that the title would arrive in 2008. At E3 2008, Reggie Fils-Aime unveiled the title in playable form under the name City Folk. It was released in November 2008.People who owns shops in the city Harriet the Poodle (Shampoodle)  Harriet was first introduced in the previous Animal Crossing game which was called Wild World. She appeared in Nookington's by the stairs and she was moved to the right hand side of the city. Her store is Shampoodle.Kicks  Kicks was a new character in City Folk, he owned a business of shining shoes. You can see him in between Lloyd's store and Shampoodle.Redd's shop  Redd's shop is a corner shop in the city. It has a metal door and it's found near the west side of the city, next to the Marque. The shop sells art such as paintings and statues. These can be later donated to the Museum but you have to make sure they aren't fake.Release and reception  Initial editorial previews of the title from IGN and GameSpy indicate that, as with the title's predecessor, Wild World, Nintendo has made very few changes to the title and that some Animal Crossing players, who have played all of the past Animal Crossing games, might not find as much in City Folk, than other Animal Crossing games, although, the game is still fun and might appeal to newcomers. IGN gave City Folk a 7.5/10 rating. E3 2008: Animal Crossing: City Folk Hands-on. GameSpot gave a positive preview of the title, noting the charm of the game, but gave the game a 7.5/10 rating. The game's MSRP was $49.99 on release, but was later dropped to $19.99. Some copies of City Folk include Nintendo's Wii Speak. These copies of City Folk were sold for $69.99, but was later dropped to $34.99-$49.99.Villagers  For a list of villagers in\u00a0Animal Crossing: New Leaf, click here.Fish  Fish are a number of collectable items in the Animal Crossing series. Players can catch them with a fishing rod. They can be donated to the museum to fill up the aquarium, sold to Tom Nook/Reese, or placed in the player's home inside a Fish Tank, like a piece of furniture. However, only small fish tanks will be able to placed on top of furniture (e.g. A Table). Larger fish tanks must be put onto the floor. A large amount of fish will only emerge during the summer, a few unique species will emerge in autumn and spring, and there are almost none during the winter. Some villagers in City Folk will ask the player to try and catch a certain fish, and, upon doing so, they will give an item to the player, which could be anything from an article of clothing to a piece of furniture. For further information, see Fishing.Fish Sizes  In the series there are six different sizes of fish. Each fish is limited to its own shadow size. Sharks and sunfish are unlike other fish in that they show a fin in their shadow. In New Leaf, there are now various catch sizes of each fish that can be kept track of and recorded into an encyclopedia. Every time the player catches a fish that is bigger than the original record, it will be overwritten. However the shadow size for each type remains the same, no matter how big or small the resulting catch size is.List of fish Animal Forest  In Animal Forest, there are 32 species of fish obtainable.

The game occurs in real time, with the real calendar, and time progresses even when the game is turned off.Online play  Wild World is the second Nintendo title that uses the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, the first being Mario Kart DS. This lets players use wireless access points to connect to the Internet and visit other players' towns. As of May 20th, 2014,\u00a0Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection\u00a0on the Nintendo DS and Nintendo Wii has been discontinued. This terminated Animal Crossing: Wild World's Wi-Fi capability. The local multiplayer will still work because it does not use Wi-Fi. However, some homebrew developers have created their own custom servers allowing Wild World to be played online again.Release  Wild World was released in Japan on November 23, 2005. It was released in North America on December 5, 2005, in time for Christmas. Version 1.1 of Wild World for Japan and North America was created on February 10, 2006.Players in Europe had to wait until March 31, 2006 for the European release. It was rereleased in Japan with copies of Animal Forest. On October 13, 2016, Wild World was made available on the Wii U Virtual Console service in North America. Online and multiplayer features are not available, although the requirement for a friend to visit to upgrade to Nookington's was dropped. The game had already been available on Wii U for some time in Europe and Japan.Gameplay  Following in the footsteps of the popular GameCube original, the player starts out as a human in a town with no money. The player mortgages a small house from the local shopkeeper, the Tanuki (or raccoon in the English version) Tom Nook. Paying off a loan results in a larger house. Unlike the original Animal Crossing, where each player lives in one of four houses in a single estate, all players live together in one house. Many players will want a bigger house, because decorating their house in their way, with furniture and other items, is one of the main features of the game. The player can collect fruit, fish, insects, paintings, fossils, furniture, and other items. There are over 550 different pieces of furniture. Once the player has some furniture, taking it to their house is easy; the furniture becomes a leaf that fits in their pocket. They can also customize themselves by buying clothes, accessories, hats, or drawing patterns. Outside the house, the player can befriend the animal neighbors; the animals are much more interactive in this game than they were in the GameCube game. Villagers can still ask the player to do errands for them, but there is no longer an explicit menu item to request them, and they no longer require the player to find a missing item from a long chain of animals. Animals can also give the player their picture of themselves, with a unique quote on the back that is the player's to keep, even after they move away. The player can also customize their town by planting trees and growing flowers. At the museum, the player can donate certain items to the collections. At the tailor's, the player can buy clothes or draw their own patterns. This way, the player can customize their town. Furthermore, if animals are not enough, the player can invite up to three human friends to their town using the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection or DS to DS.New additions Changes Gallery Problems  On January 26, 2006, an accident occurred relating to the Wi-Fi features. A few weeks prior, Nintendo sent out a free Mario Coin item from Satoru Iwata to all who connected to Wi-Fi while it was available. On the same day, a failed attempt to send a second exclusive item sent a blank letter to all who connected to Nintendo Wi-Fi before 5:00 PM. This letter contained the \"glitched red tulip\" item. This item could be planted in cement as a tree or, if put into the player's house, would create an invisible, irremovable wall. The item could be disposed of by planting it in the ground or selling it. On February 13, 2006, Nintendo sent out a letter containing 10,000 Bells and an amusing town bulletin board notice to apologize for the mistake. Here is a video of the glitched barrier.Trivia References K.K. Slider  K.K. Slider (\u3068\u305f\u3051\u3051, Totakeke?), commonly known as K.K., or DJ K.K. is a dog who appears in all of the Animal Crossing series games to date. He works as a musician, playing songs on his guitar. In Animal Crossing, he could be found near the train station; Wild World and City Folk had him playing in The Roost caf\u00e9; whereas New Leaf saw him move to working in Club LOL. His birthday was revealed in Animal Crossing Plaza. Like other special characters that appear in the Animal Crossing series, he does not celebrate it. K.K. Slider plays a total of 55 songs in Animal Crossing, 70 songs in Wild World, 75 in City Folk, and 91 in New Leaf. A full list of his songs can be found here.Personality  K.K. Slider is a hippie-style traveling musician, which is reflected in his mellow speech towards the player. He comes across as someone who wants to be liberated, as shown by his rebellion against putting a price on his songs. This adds to the musician stereotype of going against a particular norm. Despite that, his songs are for sale in New Leaf for 3,200 (3,600 with the bell boom ordinance) bells when Timmy and Tommy upgraded to T.I.Y. K.K. has an obvious passion for performing for others, as he offers to play for people on a weekly basis. In Wild World, he seems to know Brewster fairly well.Appearances In Animal Forest and Animal Crossing  In Animal Forest and Animal Crossing, K.K. Slider is seen sitting on the stool close to the Train Station found from 8:00 PM to 12:00 AM on Saturday. He still has the same role, to request or ask a song or for him to choose. He is also seen when the games are started and booted up.In Wild World  In Wild World, K.K. now plays his music at The Roost on Saturday evenings, from 8:00 PM to 12:00 AM. The player may request a song, otherwise K.K. will sing a randomly selected song. After the performance, the player receives a free copy of the song that was played. The copy of the song can then be deposited and used in any stereo in the player's house. He is also involved in the Golden Axe Trading Event, where he trades the player his picture when given the country guitar (which is received from Wendell).In City Folk  K.K. has a similar role in City Folk as he does in previous games. Now, he gives encores of his music. However, the encores are not added to the dock of the player. As in Wild World, he is seen in The Roost on Saturday nights, from 8:00 PM. to midnight. If the player decides to request a song, they are required to type it in. The player can also choose a song by mood or let him pick a random song. The game credits play while he plays a song.In New Leaf  In New Leaf, K.K. appears on stage on Saturday nights after 8:00 pm inside Club LOL, owned by Dr. Shrunk. From Sunday to Friday, he takes on the guise of DJ K.K., performing a variety of different songs based on themes. On the first performance as K.K. Slider, he will randomly pick one of the new songs introduced in New Leaf. Afterwards, the player is allowed to request a song by specific title or mood. Players will get the first song he plays, but not the rest, unless they do not have enough space in their pockets, in which case the player will receive a song as soon as they have made space in their pockets and requested another song. And on your birthday or the Saturday before your birthday, if you request K.K. Birthday, K.K. Slider will play it for you. If you request K.K. Birthday any other time, he will not play it for you. The credits play as he plays a song His songs now come with unique album covers. These album covers now make it possible to hang copies of his songs on the walls. K.K. Slider's Pic is obtainable. If the player listens to a K.K. show for 20 weeks consecutively, the picture is received in the mail.In D\u014dbutsu no Mori (film)  K.K. Slider has a minor role in D\u014dbutsu no Mori. Margie requests that he should play K.K. Bossa.Cameo In Super Smash Bros. Melee  K.K. Slider makes a cameo in Super Smash Bros. Melee appearing as a trophy as well as being one of the special characters and appearing in a screenshot in the stages.Trophy Information  \"A wandering musician whose daily life is a bit of a mystery. He plays in front of the train station every Saturday night starting at 8:00 PM. He has a large repertoire and plays old and new hits from all over the world. His music is so ingrained in the villagers that it's impossible to imagine them living without it.\"In Super Smash Bros. Brawl  K.K. Slider makes again a cameo in Super Smash Bros. Brawl appearing as a trophy as well as being one of the special characters and appearing in a screenshot in the stages.Trophy Information  \"A wandering musician. He plays concerts every Saturday night at the Roost in the basement of the museum. All he carries is a single acoustic guitar, but he can play music from all genres. You can request a single tune per concert, and afterward he will give you a recording of the song to take home. In Wild World, his playlist included 70 songs.\"In Mario Kart 8  K.K., along with other characters, appears in Mario Kart 8 in the Animal Crossing race course of the Crossing Cup, included with the Animal Crossing \u00d7 Mario Kart 8 downloadable content package. He sits in different predetermined spots on the course depending on the season; in addition, he performs a song when the player drives close to him, each corresponding with a specific mood: He also appears in the Switch version of the game, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, this time included in the base game instead of with paid DLC.Trivia Tom Nook's store  Tom Nook's store is the economic centerpiece of every player's town (with the exception of Re-Tail in New Leaf). The store is owned and operated by Tom Nook, the most important non-playable character in the series. In Wild World, Tom Nook stocks items based in Groups (A, B or C). The player's town is designated a group, and items from that group are more likely to stock in the store. Items from other groups will stock as well, but less frequently. The only way to find out what group the player's town has been designated is for them to keep a tally of the number of items from each group. Item Groups do not exist in Animal Crossing or City Folk, items are available based on individual towns. When the shop is about to upgrade, a message will be posted on the News Bulletin telling that on the next day, the shop will be closed for remodeling. Nook also sends the players a letter informing them that his shop will be closed that day.History In Animal Crossing  Tom Nook's store made its first appearance outside of Japan in the Nintendo Gamecube Animal Crossing, as did many of the items sold at his store. The store was randomly located on the map of each town, but, like the Post Office, could only be found in the 'A' acres. The store offered furniture, clothing, tools, flowers, tree saplings, carpet, wallpaper, paint, and sign boards in exchange for Bells, the currency of the Animal Crossing world. At the beginning of each game, the player will have a part-time job at Nook's Cranny, to help pay off their mortgage. This will involve making deliveries, writing letters, and meeting the residents of the town. While working for Nook, he gives a Uniform. This outfit is rare and it cannot be obtained from anywhere else. After finishing the tutorial part-time work, the player is able to sell various items to Tom Nook in exchange for Bells. In many respects, these transactions form the core of the game experience.In Animal Crossing: Wild World  Wild World also featured Nook's store randomly placed, but as the acre system was discarded for this title, the store may be located anywhere in the town. Furthermore, it will always be accompanied by Mable and Sable's clothes shop directly to the east. Several minor changes were made for this title. The sign board item is no longer offered, though other tools have been added. Nook also does not sell clothing in this title, except via catalog; one must purchase shirts and other accessories next door from the Able Sisters. Shampoodle was also featured in Nook's store in Wild World, operated by Harriet as a hairdresser in the Nookington's upgrade.In Animal Crossing: City Folk  While the store is once again located randomly, it is no longer tied to the Able Sister's shop. Store hours for the Nook 'N' Go upgrade were changed, with the store now remaining open until 1am. Tom Nook's Point System was revised to include a gift exchange feature, so that points can be exchanged for rare items. The Shampoodle was moved from Nook's to the city in this title. Interestingly, this title also features the thus-far unique ability to have Nook downgrade his store. Thirty days after the player obtains Nookington's, as they are exiting the store, Nook will ask if the player favors good hours, a balance, or variety. The player's response will cause him to downgrade to Nook 'n' Go, Nookway, or keep Nookington's, respectively. Any change, if requested, will happen a week later. If the store has been downgraded, Tom Nook will eventually survey the player again.In Animal Crossing: New Leaf  In New Leaf, Timmy and Tommy now run Tom Nook's old shop, while Tom Nook has taken a new living and runs a home improvement store named\u00a0Nook's Homes, alongside with Lyle. Tommy runs the shop on Monday, Wednesday, Friday,\u00a0and Sunday.\u00a0Timmy runs the shop on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.\u00a0Shampoodle's salon is not inside the shop in this title, as it would open up above Able Sisters in Main Street. However, once the store gets its first upgrade into T&T Mart (which is very similar to Nook's Cranny), Tommy will run the store in the morning and Timmy will work the night shift, similar to how Pelly and Phyllis run the Post Office. Each time the Player expands the stores, both Timmy and Tommy will be seen and work more frequently.Special Features  These are the special features that Tom Nook's Store can provide.The Turnip Stalk Market  A noteworthy item that Nook will buy is the turnip, an item that may be purchased by the player from Joan on Sunday mornings between 6:00 AM and noon. This particular transaction is notable because the price Nook will pay varies from day to day, forcing the player to follow the Stalk Market. In New Leaf, the task of purchasing turnips was handed on to Reese, owner of Re-Tail. Joan still has the job of selling the turnips to the player.The Catalog  Aside from selling items in the store, Nook also gives the player access to their own personalized catalog, from which the player can order any item that they have held in their pockets. Anything that was ever held there will be featured, but rare items, fossils, fish, etc. cannot be ordered. When purchased, an item will arrive by mail in about five hours. Only five items may be ordered at a time between mailings.Monthly Lottery  Exclusive to Animal Crossing, Nook offers a raffle for three rare items on the last day of every month. One entry for a chance to win requires five raffle tickets. Tickets are given to the player by Nook during the month after the purchase of an item in the store (not for items ordered through the catalog). The tickets are only good for the month they are labeled for but can be used in the future if saved. Nook will only give out raffle tickets for purchasing certain items. Items that are worth a raffle ticket are clothes, umbrellas, furniture, wallpaper, and carpet. Nook takes five raffle tickets, rolls the tumbler and lets out a colored ball. White balls are not winners. Green wins the third prize, red the second and gold wins the first prize.Tom Nook Point System  When buying items in the store in Wild World and City Folk, Players are awarded Nook Points. For every 100 Bells spent, the Player earns 1 Nook Point. However, this is not cumulative: i.e. buying a pack of seeds at 80 Bells gives zero Nook Points, buying a second pack for a total of 160 Bells will still give zero Nook Points since they were purchased separately. Nook Points serve to reward players for shopping at Nook's, offering discounts and prizes for their loyalty.Methods for gaining points  The easiest method for accumulating points would be on the Point Special. This event which are announced on the Bulletin Board, any item will award five times the normal point value. A normal purchase of an item at 100 Bells will now give the player five points during these days. Items ordered from the catalog will work as well. During these times, a moon will give the player 1,600 points and spending 400,000 Bells would unlock the Platinum membership. Normally, this amount would not be enough for Silver membership.Stages Nook's Cranny  Nook's Cranny is the first incarnation of Tom Nook's Store. Open from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m., the player begins the game with this store. In City Folk, Nook's store is laid out with shelving on the left wall, supporting one wallpaper (changes daily), some flooring (changes Daily), a flower seed or sapling, medicine, and some writing paper. Two pieces of furniture stand alone in front of the store. Three tools are set up on a table in the center of the room, which usually are a combination of Nets, Fishing Rods, Shovels, and Watering Cans. At the end of the shelving on the left is Nook's Point Tracking System. The bottom-right of the store resembles the cashier, and is one of the trademark features that all of Nook's Stores have. 'Nook's Cranny' is a parody of 'nook and cranny', meaning a small corner or hole. The store itself resembles a shed, made with wooden planks and held together with metal sheets. In fact, it is even stated that Tom Nook's shop may be Tortimer's old gardening shed before he became mayor. It is the only one of Nook's shops without an automatic door. The player must spend and/or sell a total of 25,000 Bells and play for at least eight days for an upgrade. After earning a Bronze membership at Nook's Point Tracking System, a model of Nook's Cranny is obtained.Nook 'n' Go  Nook 'N' Go is the second of Tom Nook's shops in the Animal Crossing series . For Tom Nook to expand to this shop, the player will need to buy/sell 25,000 Bells worth of stock at Nook's Cranny and play the game for at least 8 days. It is the only shop that has a sign pole. This shop is also the one that is open latest, and earliest (from 7:00 AM \u2013 11:00 PM) in Animal Crossing\u00a0and from 7:00 AM to 1:00 AM in City Folk. In Wild World, the store opens and closes at the same time as the other stores. Nook 'N' Go also appears in Wild World and City Folk. To upgrade to Nookway in City Folk, the player must buy/sell a total of 80,000 bells and the store must be Nook'n'go for at least fifteen days. To upgrade to Nookway in the other versions, the player must only buy/sell 65,000 bells worth of stock at Nook'n'go.Nookway  Nookway is the third expansion of Tom Nook's shop. For it to open, the player will need to spend 65,000 Bells at the previous Nook stores combined. It has a wider variety of items to choose from. This shop follows Nook 'N' Go. It is the second shop to have an automatic door.Nookington's  Nookington's is the largest expansion for Tom Nook's shop. In this expansion a whole new floor is opened up where furniture, wallpaper, and flooring is sold. Also, on the top floor Timmy and Tommy replace Tom Nook. In Wild World, after Tom Nook expands into Nookington's, the Shampoodle will also move into it to provide hairstyle makeovers for players at the cost of 3,000 Bells. To get Tom Nook to expand into Nookington's, the player must spend 240,000 bells and have a friend shop at the store. This shop has an automatic door. In City Folk, the player does not need a friend to shop at Nookway, and the upgrade cost has been reduced to 150,000.Upgrading in Wild World  To upgrade to Nookington's in Wild World, the player must spend 240,000 Bells at Nookway and a friend must buy something in the player's town as well. This creates problems for those who do not have a friend that they can connect with, and further problems if players do not have a sufficient internet connection using the built-in Wi-Fi using the DS (to connect to the internet) or Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector (that connects the DS or Wii to the internet using the computer) - they will be unable to upgrade. There is no other way to get Nookington's, though the problem can be solved by exchanging friend codes with another player over the internet. However, some Wild World game cards may have a glitch and will upgrade from Nookway to Nookington's whether a visitor shopped at the store or not. Online forums concerning the game will generally feature several people looking to travel and make new friends, with a dangerous risk. However, as of May 20, 2014, Nintendo has officially stopped Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection for the Wii and DS, making visiting towns over the internet and upgrading to Nookington's normally impossible. The Wii U's Virtual Console version of Wild World, however, allows the player to upgrade to Nookington's without the need of a friend visiting their town and buying something from Nookway.Trivia Characters  Category:Characters is a list of articles about individual characters who appeared in at least one Animal Crossing game. This list does not include characters seen in Super Smash Bros. Brawl who are not affiliated with the Animal Crossing series, such as Mario or Pikachu. Other categories are available for lists of characters who are only in a certain game, made their first appearances in a particular title, or can be further subdivided into villagers, visitors, and special residents.\u00a0Snooty  Snooty villagers (\u30aa\u30c8\u30ca Otona, or \u3042\u305f\u3057 Atashi) (sometimes called Snobby) are female characters in the Animal Crossing series. They are called snooty villagers because they act more mature and higher-class than other villagers. They are usually portrayed wearing makeup and high-end clothes that match their style, and their homes appear luxurious, though there are some exceptions. As of now, there are 65 snooty villagers.Characteristics  Snooty villagers are well-spoken and sometimes appear offensive and rude towards other villagers, including the player. They are self-centered, hot-tempered, and sarcastic, but if the player talks to them often, they open up and become more kind, sometimes giving the player lessons in fashion. However, this doesn't prevent them from making the occasional scathing comment. Snooty villagers usually have exotic or upper-class names, or names relating to high-value items and gemstones, making them easy to distinguish when talking to villagers around the town. Snooty villagers go to sleep at 3:00 AM in the original Animal Crossing and wake up at 9:00 AM. In Wild World, and City Folk they go to sleep at 3:30 AM, and wake up at 9:00 AM. In New Leaf they wake up at 9:30 AM and sleep at 2:00 AM. Like the peppy and normal villagers, they read \"Ms. Nintendique\" frequently, coming out with quotations from the magazine such as what their lucky item of the day is, or saying that they bought so much blush that the magazine gave them an item, which they then give to the player. They will often talk about Gracie and how much they love her clothing. They also frequently talk about the unseen magazine, Chic (villager species) Monthly. They will find it difficult to socialize with most\u00a0villagers, who have conflicting lifestyles to their own. They do not understand how lazy villagers can relax and not worry about their physical appearance. They also cannot fathom how jock villagers exercise or talk about exercising seemingly constantly and not worry about fashion; a jock villager's comment on the snooty villager's fitness will anger them. Normal villagers usually do not get along with them, and on most occasions both villagers criticize each other or the normal villager gets offended by the snooty villager's criticism. Peppy villagers sometimes, without knowing, let their ideas come out; for example, a peppy villager may say \"You know you're always rude...\", leading the snooty villager to leave the conversation annoyed. Uchi villagers likely won't get along with them, due to snooty villagers' tendency to talk about them behind their backs. They get along with cranky villagers, who share their maturity and viewpoints on life, and smug villagers as well, due to their similar interests in fashion. In City Folk, when you talk to snooty villagers in the city, they will sometimes do the irritation emote before saying anything to you. In New Leaf, when they have been befriended, snooty villagers will give the player medicine if they speak to them after being stung by bees. In Happy Home Designer, they turned into housewives and got especially interested in cooking and housecleaning. When they're at the restaurants they say that they would never be able to cook in the same way despite they have years of experience behind or they're envious that someone cooks better than them. They often talk about unknown generic neighbours comparing their lifestyle to themselves: of course Snooty's habits are always better than others. They're even more kind than in ACNL, having been \"replaced\" in the role of the most mischievous by the Uchi personalities.Quotes  Below are some (not all) quotes made by snooty villagers.Picture Portraits  Below is only relevant to Wild World. Snooty villagers will ask you the following question to trigger their portrait-giving sequence: Responses will be: By choosing \"I don't know\", and after a tirade about being mysterious, she will reply by saying:Trivia Tom Nook  Tom Nook (\u305f\u306c\u304d\u3061, Tanukichi?) is a special character who plays the most important role in all of the games. He is termed a raccoon in the western versions of the game but a tanuki in the Japanese version. In all games leading to New Leaf, he is the manager of the town shop. After the final expansion, Nookington's, he will employ his \"nephews\" Timmy and Tommy, who work on the second floor in every Animal Crossing series game except Animal Crossing: New Leaf. However, in New Leaf, Nook has taken his interest in real estate to a whole new level, opening Nook's Homes, whilst Timmy and Tommy run the town shop. In Wild World, he will give out his picture if the player gives him the safe from the Golden Axe Trading Event.Appearance  Tom Nook is a tanuki (a\u00a0raccoon in Western versions) with brown fur. His eye area has a dark brown mask-like shape for his raccoon eye characteristics. His nose tip, his hands, feet, and his tail are dark brown. The apron he wears over his lower half is inferred to be for modesty, a reference to the legends of the tanuki. In New Leaf, Nook wears a white shirt with a red necktie and a green sweater vest over it. His sweater has a left sided pocket protector with a pen sticking out. He also wears black pants. Whenever outside of Nook's Homes, such as the player selecting their new home spot or at The Roost, Nook is seen with a yellow jacket over his sweater.Services and General Information  In Animal Crossing, Wild World and City Folk, When the player first arrives in town, Tom Nook will greet them and introduce them to their new house. He will give a quote to them on the initial mortgage of the home. Tom will hire the player to  work part-time at his shop to help pay off the loan. Eventually, he will run out of tasks for the player and will lay them off, letting them free to find other methods to make Bells, in order to pay off the rest of the debt. Following the job, the player can shop at Tom Nook's store, and can sell items to him, for which he will pay for in full value. In New Leaf, however, Tom Nook has become a real estate agent, leaving the management of his store, now known as Nookling stores, to his \"nephews,\" Timmy and Tommy. The responsibility of welcoming new players has been given to Isabelle. Like in previous games, Tom will be responsible for orchestrating the construction of the player's house and providing the mortgage the player pays off via the ABD machine in the Post Office. Tom Nook runs a real estate agency called Nook's Homes, which also provides house customization and renovation services. The office also functions as the headquarters of the home inspection organization, the Happy Home Academy, ran by Lyle. Tom Nook also assists the player in searching for a plot to build their house when the first move in. Once a plot has been chosen, he will pitch his tent for the player to use as temporary housing while they are gathering funds to pay off their first home loan. Tom Nook's agency is also responsible for building the houses neighbors live in, as well as assisting them with moving in and out. Tom is noted to be very work-driven, and many years ago he left behind his friends, most importantly Sable, to travel to the big city. His dreams of success are quickly broken by the harsh life there. After making nothing of himself, he returns to the player's town to set up his store. Nook no longer appears to be as good of friends with Sable as he used to be, though the two often mention each other to the player. Nook seems to have a varied reputation among the villagers, with some speculating that he is, in fact, a man in a suit. In fact, when asking Dr. Shrunk about one emotion, he talks about how we all wear masks, and then says that Tom Nook \"wears a raccoon suit, but it serves the same general purpose\". Many will say that he has a checkered past, hinting at illicit activities - the fact that he seems to have a history with Redd (who describes Tom as a \"raccoon in an apron\" and treats him as something of a business rival) supports this, this is further hinted in Happy Home Designer as talking to Tom in his house he says he worked with a fox in the past and it was a horrible experience. In Animal Forest e+, the player can wake up Tom Nook after hours by banging on the doors three times with the shovel. He will be in his pajamas and allow you to shop, but he will move much slower. Not only this, anything the player sell to him will be lowered from its base price by 30%. Similarly, prices of items in the shop will be inflated by 17%, and the player is only allowed to either sell or buy what is on display. The catalog and other options will not be available either. Timmy and Tommy are Nook's nephews that appear in the final expansion of the shop, Nookington's, as assistants on the second floor. They assist him in his business. All three make a cameo in the Smashville stage in Super Smash Bros. Brawl.Game Guide  In the City Folk's game guide this description is given: \"A kind raccoon with a heart of gold (well, pockets of gold even though he only owns a shop, if ya know what I mean), Tom Nook helps you get started when you first move to town by loaning you a home to live in. Tom also runs a little supply shop in town that sells all the basics, including furniture, tools, and gardening supplies. Tom will help you in a variety of ways as your life unfolds, and you'll help him as well: keep shopping at the store and it'll get bigger and bigger. Eventually, old Tom will even need to hire his two nephews, Timmy and Tommy, just to keep his business running!\"Shop  In all games except New Leaf, Nook starts out with Nook's Cranny, expanding after the player buys enough from him. There are a total of four expansions for his shop: After a period of time with Nookington's, Tom Nook will ask you a question to better serve his customers. Based on the answer you give, Nookington's can close and reopen as a previous store to better suit your needs. Periodically, after the first questioning, Tom Nook will ask again, and the player can change their store again. This event only happens in City Folk.Other Appearances Super Smash Bros. Melee  Tom Nook appears as a Trophy in Super Smash Bros. Melee, using his in-game model from\u00a0Animal Forest (evidenced by the Japanese character on his apron). Description: \"This guy's the friendly neighborhood shopkeeper who kindly helps the player set up their first house. He has a nose for business, and his customer service is second to none. During the course of the game, his store starts as a corner shop, expands to become a convenience store, and finally becomes a thriving supermarket and stalk market.\"Super Smash Bros. Brawl  Tom Nook also appears in the sequel to Super Smash Bros. Melee, Super Smash Bros. Brawl, in the background of the Animal Crossing themed stage Smashville.D\u014dbutsu no Mori  Tom Nook appeared in D\u014dbutsu no Mori as the town shop owner, just as he does in the games. Like also in the games he helped Ai settle into town by making her work.Monopoly  Tom Nook also appears in the 2010 Nintendo Collector's Edition of Monopoly with K.K. Slider and Rosie in the light blue grids. He is worth 120 US dollars on the game board, the highest of the Animal Crossing characters that appear in the game.Super Smash Bros. for Wii U and 3DS  Tom Nook appears in the fourth installment of the Super Smash Bros. series. He appears alongside his nephews Timmy and Tommy as part of the Villager's final smash, which sees Nook construct a house on top of other fighters causing massive damage.Taiko Drum Master: Atsumete Tomodachi Daisakusen  In Taiko Drum Master: Atsumete Tomodachi Daisakusen, Isabelle, Resetti, and Tom Nook are unlockable by using their respective amiibos to listen to the Animal Crossing: New Leaf Melody (\u3068\u3073\u3060\u305b \u3069\u3046\u3076\u3064\u306e\u68ee \u30e1\u30c9\u30ec\u30fc).Stories  Sometimes, upon entering his store, he will appear in thought, and may tell you a story when approached: \"...Well, actually, I was just thinking about the good old days, hm?\nI know it seems that the world is my oyster, what with my fine shop...\nBut in my childhood, I lived the kind of life you couldn't even imagine!\nYes, yes, but this was all some time ago, but this was all some time ago, before I moved to this town, hm?\nOf course, I was born in our lovely <Town Name>, but I moved away for a time...\nYes, yes, the city years, I like to call them. I was a raccoon of action, hm?\nThe big city certainly had its charms...but it had its pitfalls, as well.\nIndeed, I had to endure certain hardships that I've never spoken of, hm?\n...Hard to believe, yes?\nYou're probably asking yourself, what the heck is Nook talking about, hm?\nFor now, <player name>, maybe it's best that we forget we ever talked about this.\"Aliases  Redd refers to him as a \"raccoon in an apron\". In Animal Crossing, Pelly refers to him as \"Mr. Nook\" when you chose to pay your loan. In New Leaf, Isabelle refers to Nook as the Real Estate Agent. Also in New Leaf, Saharah calls Tom Nook \"King Nook\" when you interact with her. His English name is derived from \"tanuki\" (often written as \"Tanooki\" in English) and his last name is likely a pun based on a myth about the Tanuki. His Japanese name, Tanukichi, is a mix between Tanuki and the Japanese word, kechi , meaning \"stingy.\"Trivia Resetti  Resetti (\u30ea\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u3055\u3093, Risetto san?, Mr. Reset), also known as Mr. Resetti, is a very cranky mole that appears in all the Animal Crossing series games. His job is to make sure that all players save continuously throughout gameplay. The more the player resets within the Animal Crossing games (or turns off the power without saving), the harsher he gets, so people must make sure that they save their game. In certain installments, resetting the game too many times will lead to either a \"fake\" reset in Animal Crossing and in Wild World, mentioning about his cousin Vicious Vole Vinnie (Possibly referencing the movie My Cousin Vinny). When Resetti's calmer, older brother Don Resetti appears, he will reveal Resetti's first name as \"Sonny\" in both Animal Crossing and City Folk.Appearances In Animal Crossing/D\u014dbutsu no Mori+  Resetti's role in Animal Forest+ and Animal Crossing stays the same throughout the whole series, but one of the main differences in this game is when he tells the player \"Thanks for buying Animal Crossing!\", which breaks down the fourth wall, where characters in a game or television program talk directly to the audience, or in this case, the playable character. As aforementioned, he appears when the GameCube resets or is turned off without saving. He will appear outside the player's house, giving a lecture of why saving is important. Resetting frequently will lead to him forcing the player to repeat a line of text to remind them of the importance of saving. Some of the sentences that the player may have to repeat are: \"I repent\", \"I'm sorry\", or even \"I like you.\" But if you say, \"I hate moles.\" he will get even more mad. Sometimes, he will pretend to reset the game himself, mentioning beforehand that all the progress the player has made will be lost. After the \"reset\" takes place, the screen will pop back up, and Mr. Resetti laughs saying: \"It was all a joke.\" If you reset enough, Resetti will start to say his doctor told him not to yell so much.In D\u014dbutsu no Mori e+  In Animal Forest e+, the player can visit the Reset Monitoring Center where Mr. Resetti and Don Resetti monitor resetting across the globe. To visit the Center, the player must speak to Mr. Resetti by resetting twice. Then, they must hit all the rocks in the town with a shovel. Once a week, a random rock may crack; hitting it again will reveal a hole the player can jump into to enter the Reset Monitoring Center. The \"Reset Alarm\" may go off while visiting. Don Resetti can also appear in the Reset Monitoring Center if he is met after resetting; one, both, or none of the moles may be present when the player visits.In Wild World  In Wild World, he portrays the same role as in the GameCube game. However, he may be seen within The Roost located inside the Museum on Sundays between 2:30 PM and 4:00 PM drinking coffee with a relaxed attitude. Resetti will converse about his work while maintaining calm demeanor when directing to the player.In City Folk  His role in City Folk stays the same as in Animal Crossing and Wild World, but he can now be encountered in new area in the city, called the Reset Surveillance Center, with his older brother occasionally making an appearance at the venue. This appears if the player has luck and the cones are out of the way, to the right of the city near the tunnel where he may give the player a Silver Shovel to leave the area. He will also appear the second time the game is accessed by the same player, to talk about the important of saving, regardless of whether or not the game has been turned off or reset with or without saving. This is the only time he will appear by the player's house for something positive.In New Leaf  Resetti's role and personality has softened in New Leaf compared to other installments in the Animal Crossing series. In New Leaf he similarly but not to an extent scolds the player for quitting without saving their game. But for the first time, Resetti is optional: after the first time the player quits without saving, he will appear in the lobby and talk about how he cannot appear again until the Resetti Surveillance Center has been built. From then on, Isabelle will remind players about saving their game when they quit without saving unless the Resetti Surveillance Center is built. The Resetti Surveillance Center can be bought as a Public Works Project by the Mayor of the Town for 360,000 Bells. This time it is inside a manhole which occasionally opens in the player's town after 8:00 PM, allowing the player to enter. When the Reset Surveillance Center is built, Resetti will appear every time the player quits without saving the game. When he appears, he will ask why the player reset, giving the player the options of \"I wanted to reset!\", \"My batteries died\", and \"I don't remember.\" By not ever saying \"I wanted to reset\", this marks the first time to where the player can avoid being lectured or yelled at by Resetti every time the player would reset their game. Once after the Reset Surveillance Center is built within the town, Resetti can be found having coffee in The Roost. Resetti can be seen if an error blurb is executed while playing with the gates open.In D\u014dbutsu no Mori  Resetti, has a minor role in D\u014dbutsu no Mori. He makes his appearance when Ai falls over when Yu is chasing a dragonfly flying around her. He appears just after she lands on Apollo's flower patch. He warns her of the rules in Animal Village, but lets her off because the damage to the flowers was accidental. He also appears when Yu and Alfonso are seen digging holes looking for fossils. Yu accidentally bangs Resetti with a shovel, and the mole gives a lecture about this \"Diggin' Spree,\" but Yu ditches him. Resetti then goes back underground to fix a leak. He can also be seen helping to decorate for the Winter Festival.Other Appearances In Super Smash Bros. Melee  Mr. Resetti himself does not appear in Super Smash Bros. Melee, but his trophy can be obtained when the player defeats five Fighting Wire Frames in Cruel Melee in Multi Man Melee Mode. It is worth noting that this marks as Mr. Resetti's first technical appearance outside Japan.Trophy Information  Prepare to receive a really long talking-to if you reset this game: the next time you play, Mr. Resetti will be waiting to deliver his best scolding. No matter what your intentions are, pressing the RESET Button will bring you face-to-face with this fervent character. Sometimes, the only way to shut him up is to apologize.In Super Smash Bros. Brawl  Mr. Resetti appears as an Assist Trophy in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, where a blurb amasses the screen while ranting through a long lecture. His dialogue box obstructs either the top or bottom half of the screen. Mr. Resetti will also respond to stage events, such as characters falling asleep or getting knocked out. He also tries to mock characters, like doing a Kirby Impression. Mr. Resetti notably breaks the 4th wall within the game, as he exclaims that he is not pleased about being \"thought of as an item\", referring to the fact that he can be summoned though the Assist Trophy. A more obvious example of breaking the 4th wall is how he appears as if the game was reset on summoning most of the time, as well as he somewhat covers the stage view.Trophy Information  Resetti has two Trophies in Brawl, one with him in the ground, and one with his feet shown. Both are unlocked at random.In Ground Trophy Text  A mole wearing a hard hat who'll show up when you restart your game without having saved. He pops up and lets you know in no uncertain terms the importance of saving your game. The problem is, his speeches are entertaining enough to warrant breaking the rules at least once. In Animal Crossing, his brother Don appears too. He's the polar opposite of his sibling.Exposed Feet Trophy Text  A character who normally appears from underground to lecture the player. However, he is not always underground\u2014in Animal Crossing: Wild World, he can be found sipping coffee at the Roost if you go at a certain time on a certain day. In the Japanese-only \"e+\" version, he works at a so-called \"Resetti Observation Center\" where you can pop in for a visit.In Super Smash Bros. Wii U/3DS  Mr. Resetti no longer appears as an Assist Trophy, however, is briefly referenced in Super Smash Bros. Wii U during Palutena's guidance conversation regarding the villager. Trophy Information Be sure to save your game before you turn it off, or this guy will show up screaming \"AAAAAAARGH!\" Sonny Resetti and his favorite brother, Don, keep an eye out for sudden game resets, and they aren't shy about reminding you to save often. Best not to aggravate them needlessly...In Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate  Capcom revealed outfits based on Isabelle and\u00a0Mr. Resetti\u00a0via its Unity blog, and confirmed that Felines' meow sound will be altered accordingly when they are equipped.In Mario Kart 8  In Mario Kart 8, Mr. Resetti appears as an obstacle in the Animal Crossing race course, included with the Animal Crossing \u00d7 Mario Kart 8 downloadable content package. He appears in every season with the exception of winter, and he plays a role similar to the Monty Mole, occasionally popping out of the ground to pose an obstacle for racers.Coffee preference  Mr. Resetti likes Blue Mountain coffee with no sugar or milk. Mr. Resetti's preference of coffee with no sugar or milk is a reflection of his bitter personality.Quotes and Dialogues  The following is a full list of Resetti's dialogues and quotes.Mario Maker  Resetti appears as an unlockable amiibo costume in the intermediate 100 Mario Challenge.Trivia Gracie  Gracie (\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30b9, Gur\u0113su?, Grace) is a celebrity fashion designer in the Animal Crossing series who occasionally passes through the undeveloped towns of the country, impacting the lives of fashion-conscious villagers. As a giraffe, Gracie is very tall compared to the player. Gracie is the \"number one name\" in fashion in the Animal Crossing universe, and has no known rivals. Gracie is a male in the original Japanese version of the game, Animal Forest. Gracie is the face of Ms. Nintendique, but it is unknown if Gracie is connected with Fauna Magazine as well. Snooty villagers will sometimes call her outfits \"trash\" and her car a rusty heap, disgusted at the motives and ideals of Gracie's style. Gracie has appeared in every Animal Crossing series game to date, but was not featured in the film adaptation, D\u014dbutsu no Mori.Appearance  Gracie is a giraffe with pale yellow and dark brown hooves, brown spots on the skin, short brown hair, and purple eyeshadow. She wears a purple scarf and brown pantyhose on her legs. One of Gracie's notable apparel is the tank shirt. The shirt has her personal design consisting of a blue fill and two circles colored green and orange. This is also used in all of Gracie's furniture involving cloth. In New Leaf, Gracie wears round rimmed shades on her forehead colored the same as her signature tank top, although her appearance stays the same otherwise.Personality  Gracie is highly pampered and it can be assumed that Gracie lives a glamorous lifestyle. Gracie drives an expensive looking car, which is the only personal vehicle to appear in the games so far. Gracie has an abrupt manner and doesn't hold back from saying any opinions. Whenever Gracie's car becomes dirty, Gracie demands a nearby villager cleans it up. Gracie is often thought of as bossy and arrogant amongst the villagers, but will reward those who help or happen to strike the right fashion style.Professional Life Gracie's Fashion Line  Gracie works in the fashion industry. Gracie's designs are so well known that the name \"Gracie\" is synonymous with fashion (and, naturally, the magazine she stars in). However, rather than be intimidated by the city, Gracie has used the hustle and bustle to become famous. She owns a store in the city in City Folk and in T&T Emporium in New Leaf.In Animal Crossing  In the GCN games, Gracie will appear on a random week day. The player must wash Gracie's Car by quickly tapping \"A\". If the car isn't washed enough the player will not receive a reward. If the car is somewhat clean (indicated by small sparkles), the player will receive a normal shirt. If the car sparkles and shines, the player will obtain a special Gracie brand shirt. An odd coincidence that occurs is that every time Copper and Booker hold a Bust Illegal Parkers campaign, Gracie appears.In Wild World  In Wild World, Gracie will come on a random weekday by car on the same spot Redd sets up his tent. Gracie will make a quiz for the player, and will then give them a letter with clothing attached. If talked to enough, Gracie will ask the player to make an offer (in Bells) on how badly they want to achieve style. The player will not be able to obtain anything else from Gracie after they have both completed the quiz and received the style until the next time Gracie visits.In City Folk  Gracie has a store called \"GracieGrace\". The only other known staff member is Labelle. Here she sells unique furniture, shirts, and accessories at high prices. Gracie will appear in this store during the first day of every month, and sometimes at other dates. Gracie offers judgements of the player's fashion sense. The items considered are the player's clothes, accessories, haircut, hair color, and shoes. However, if wearing a helmet the hair style is not considered. If the player wears a wig, the color of the wig is considered rather than the hairstyle. Below is a guide to pass her 'fashion checks'. Do: Don't: If the player's ensemble is sufficiently coordinated, Gracie will give a 10% discount on GracieGrace purchases while within the store, though it expires when exiting the store.In New Leaf  After the player has expanded the Nookling store in their town to\u00a0 T.I.Y.\u00a0and spent 70,000 bells or more there, Gracie will start to visit the town's Plaza on completely random days. However, she may rarely appear for some players, making it more difficult to get the T&T Emporium. But, if you know the exact date Gracie once came, there is a proven way to see her. Time travel to that day, save and quit, and time travel a day forward. Then save and quit again and time travel a day backwards. Gracie should appear at the event plaza. While in the plaza, she expresses an interest in opening a shop, but in order to do so Gracie must check if the fashion sense of the town's people meets her fashion standards. Gracie will then give the player the chance to complete a fashion check. Gracie selects a style theme and will ask the player to dress appropriately for that theme. The Player can only pass the fashion check by wearing an outfit with most components matching the theme and no components clashing with the theme. If the fashion check is failed three times or it is not passed before midnight, the player will have to wait until Gracie's next visit to the town before they can ask for another check. However, if the player passes, they will receive a piece of furniture or clothing from Gracie's shop; depending on how well they scored in said fashion check (clothing is given for 'so-so' grades). After four successful fashion checks (whether the result is \"so-so\" or \"exceptional\" does not matter), Gracie will decide to open a shop in the town. Once T&T Emporium is built, Gracie's shop can be found on the third floor and fashion checks will no longer be available.Effect on the Town  Whenever Gracie visits the town, the snooty female villagers take note. Occasionally, Gracie will create an outfit for villagers who do favors or pay money. As a result, Gracie\u2019s designs have become coveted among female villagers. Peppy villagers sincerely hope that the reason they have not experienced much success in their performing careers is because they do not have fancy clothes, and see Gracie\u2019s fashions as a way to correct the issue. The lazy villagers have been known to admit crushes on Gracie, as people of beauty do not often visit the town. If the jocks wear one of the player's patterns in Wild World, they'll say something like, \"Man, that's UNCANNY. Are you Gracie's apprentice, [catchphrase]?\"Trivia Animal Crossing: Jump Out Peppy  Peppy villagers (also called \u5143\u6c17 genki, or \u30a2\u30bf\u30a4 atai) (sometimes called perky) are female characters in the Animal Crossing series. They are incessantly friendly and excitable, making them very quick to apologize for anything they regret doing, even if they had not done anything particularly wrong. As of now, there are 65 peppy villagers. The Japanese name Genki comes from Wild World, where it is referenced in the game's files. It has not been mentioned outside of the game by Nintendo.Characteristics  They speak with chipper, bouncy voices and enjoy cheering when talking with player/players and other villagers; they are rarely discouraged from doing anything. They come out of their homes often. In the original Animal Crossing, they go to sleep at 11:30 PM and wake up at 7:00. In Wild World and City Folk they usually go to sleep at 2:30 AM and wake up at 7:00 AM. In New Leaf, they wake up at 9:00 A.M. and go to sleep at 1:00 A.M. They are always excited to see the player. They have short attention spans and wild imaginations. They express a number of aspirations which they will often share with the player such as their numerous claims to stardom as a pop star or diva. They have a tendency to say stereotypical valley girl words and phrases like \"ohmigosh!!!\" and \"like\" (as in, \"That is, like, so cool!\"). When they are describing certain things, they often use \"SOOOO!\" and \"totally!\" They commonly say a long, drawn-out \"Yaaaay!\" to show excitement and tend to claim they are hyper because they eat candy frequently. Peppy villagers are considered the female equivalents of Jock villagers, who are also energetic and very young and somewhat immature. They find it easy to get along with other villagers, but may become the center of jokes and gossip created by snooty and cranky villagers, and when either of two are rude, peppy villagers are rude back to them. They get along with normal, lazy, and jock villagers, who naturally avoid making rude comments and share similar lifestyles with them, such as; food with lazy villagers, activities with jock villagers and typical, 'girly' discussions with normal villagers. They do not hesitate to talk to snooty and cranky villagers, but may annoy them and make them angry with their conflicting habits, such as jumpiness, which conflicts with their refined stature.Quotes  Below are some (not all) quotes made by peppy villagers.Trivia Cranky  Cranky villagers (\u30b3\u30ef\u30a4 Kowai, or \u30aa\u30ec Ore) (also called Grumpy villagers), are male villagers in the Animal Crossing series. The name is a direct reference to the meaning of cranky; someone who is irritated or annoyed easily. As of now, there are 63 cranky villagers.Characteristics  The cranky characters can seem quite bitter and out-of-touch with social trends, making them generally unpopular with the peppy villagers. They have the deepest voice of all the characters except Joan, and many have frowns on their faces. In Animal Crossing they go to sleep at 5:00 AM and wake up at 10:00 AM. In Wild World and City Folk they go to sleep at 4:30 am and wake up at 10:00 am each day. In New Leaf, they go to bed at 4:00 am, and get up at 10:00 am. When trying to enter the house of a cranky villager before they wake up, the letter explaining that they are asleep is much angrier than other personalities. They usually spend a small amount of their day in their houses, and most of the day out. They are very self-centered and often enjoy gossiping about lifestyles of other villagers, making them snobby as well as grouchy. They will act protective of the player when the player becomes friends with them and they will seem to disagree with most of the things that other villagers say. They find it easy to get along with snooty, jock, and other cranky villagers, usually discussing trivial things such as food and the problems with unhealthy food. They find it difficult to get along with\u00a0peppy, smug, and uchi villagers, who cranky villagers claim are mucking around. Thus, conversations between a cranky villager and a villager of one of these types will result in one of them depressed and occasionally cranky villagers will tell the player that things are getting boring so they are considering spreading rumors about another animal and 'watching the fun.' The usual response from either of the personalities is to call them an 'old man' or 'grandpa.' They also get along with lazy\u00a0and normal villagers most of the time, but can directly offend them when anything wrong has been said. Although they may appear unfriendly, if the player talks to them, does errands for them and sends them letters for long enough, they will eventually begin to open up and will be more friendly with the player. In Animal Crossing, a cranky character will often speak to the player about their niece after becoming friends, they also may give requests relating to their nieces, such wanting a ball for their niece or a bug to give to them. While dialogue in earlier games suggests that their niece is coming to visit them, said niece never actually appears. Also, in City Folk, they may say this to another cranky villager. When a cranky villager becomes sad, he will say something along the lines of how he 'lives in a cold world.' They can usually grow to be close friends if the player meets them often and sends them letters with presents attached. Many of their picture quotes are a variant of \"I'm watching you.\" Cranky villagers are often the ones that give the player an invitation to Crazy Redd's, though they do warn them about how sly he can be. When a player gets closer to a cranky villager, the villager may appear more gentleman-like than the other villagers, because while the player is getting to know them, they may refer to themselves as more mature or like an old man. In Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer they state to follow ukulele lessons and show their knack for everything related to Hawaii.Quotes  Below are some (not all) quotes made by cranky villagers.Trivia Villager  Villagers are the main NPCs in the Animal Crossing series, and there are currently around 460 of them. They live simple, quiet lives scattered around the player's town. On the release of Wild World, villagers started to specialize in hobbies, such as fishing, finding fossils, collecting insects - to name but a few. They are all animals, as the title of the series, Animal Crossing, suggests, and they come in a variety of species, from mice to elephants. In Animal Crossing: New Leaf villagers are more interactive. They occasionally plant flowers, shake trees or even buy items from the shop. Villagers move into the town at random, and there is no way to determine who will move in next until their house is set, they have convinced a villager from another town to move in, or the player has convinced the villager to move in from the Campsite. Players with The New Leaf Welcome amiibo update can contact Wisp which allows them to move in any villager using their amiibo card. Each villager initially comes with a unique interior house design, which will gradually change over time depending on what furniture they request (as well as insects, fish, fossils, and clothes) or they obtain by either buying it or getting it from the player. When villagers talk to other villagers clothing change is a frequent occurrence. The villager's house can usually only be entered if they are inside. Villagers have varying \"sleep cycles\", and the house remains locked while they are sleeping. The player cannot see inside chests, wardrobes, or any other type of storage units inside a villager's home; when the player opens one, a specific message will appear relating to each wardrobe, some references to other Nintendo games. The player also cannot turn lights off inside of a villager's home. Sometimes, at random, the villager will offer a furniture item when the player looks in a storage unit.Appearance  As aforementioned, villagers appear as animals within each game in the series. Being of anthropomorphic nature, they stand on two feet with the same posture and poise as the human playable characters do. They also wear clothes and makeup, giving them a human appearance. They are capable of acting out different perceived, human emotions from crying to rejoicing, which are considered impossible in most animal species. The playable character can learn these emotions from Dr. Shrunk and Frillard (City Folk).Personalities  This section briefly underlines the key notes about each personality trait. For more information, check out the individual personality pages:Male Female  There are different personalities and characteristics found in villagers. All villagers share the same interests and hobbies, but some are more apparent in individual personalities than others. There are several personalities: Cranky, Jock, Lazy and Smug, which are male villager personalities, and Snooty, Peppy, Normal and Uchi, which are female personalities. The different personalities share similar traits, especially the male and female equivalents. There are many common characteristics of villagers. For instance, Snooty and Cranky villagers can come off quite mature, snobbish, arrogant, and somewhat hostile towards others and the player and will soon warm up, but still appearing arrogant. Uchi and Smug villagers will come off as concerning and caring towards the player and other villagers, almost as parental-like figures. Normal and Lazy villagers appear very calm for the majority, but are also very kind and caring and will usually get along with the player and other villagers for the most part. Peppy and Jock villagers are typically friendly as well, but will show a competitive side and somewhat child-like traits.Starting Villagers  The starting villagers are the first villagers the player has in their town when they start a new game. The amount of Starting Villagers differs in each game. In Animal Crossing there were 6, in Wild World there were 3, in City Folk the amount was reverted to 6, and in New Leaf, the amount of starting villagers is 5.Role in Animal Crossing  Initially in original Animal Crossing, there are 6 villagers in the town when the player moves in. The maximum number is 15. Once 15 villagers have moved in, one of the already existing villagers will attempt to move out to allow a new villager to move in. Villagers have a unique role in Animal Crossing that is not so apparent in Wild World. During town events, they gather and celebrate in different areas of the town to partake in different events. Most noted is during the New Year's Eve celebrations, where they gather around the town pond (in future releases, they are simply scattered around town, and have special conversations revolving around the festivities). During Summer and Winter, a random villager may appear in the town and live inside a tent or an igloo for the day, where they will offer to play games with the player and give the chance to obtain unique items. In future game releases, they are not a source of rare, unique furniture, but become a means of gaining furniture through trades. They also do not camp out, and only live in their homes.Role in Wild World  Initially in Wild World, there are 3 villagers in the town when the player moves in, out of a possible 8. Once 8 villagers have moved in, one of the already existing villagers may move out, to allow another new villager to move in, lowering the number to 7 until the new villager moves in. Although villagers do have a similar role as they do in Animal Crossing, they do have a few new features. When the playable character befriends them, they are likely to give the player a picture of themselves, as proof of their friendship. Each picture has a unique quote for each villager, which can be read when the picture is placed in the player's house and clicked. There are no tents or igloos in Wild World. They are also competitive in Wild World, a feature unique to the game. During some conversations, they may ask the player if they want to see who can catch the biggest fish or find the rarest insect. These are games which are similar to the Fishing Tourney and Bug-Off. During these events, when two villagers meet they will not talk. Another new feature were the rumors that some villagers were dating. This could be discovered by talking to some of the villagers in the town, who would either be gossiping about the two villagers, or one of the two villagers in the relationship. Usually, it is snooty villagers who gossip. There was no proof, however, of the two villagers dating, other than through conversation. Unlike the first game, the villagers walk at a much slower pace than the player, which is continued through City Folk.Role in City Folk  Initially in City Folk, there are 6 villagers in the town when the player moves in. The maximum number is 10. Once 10 villagers have moved in, one of the already existing villagers will attempt to move out to allow a new villager to move in. Villagers have a slightly different role than in Wild World. They no longer compete against the player, as this feature was the prominent feature within the Bug-Off and Fishing Tourney events. They do, however, have a new feature which is playing Hide-and-Seek, where a group of up to 3 villagers hide around the town; behind trees, signs and buildings (but never in them). They no longer give out pictures of themselves when they become friends with the player. Villagers now talk about the glamour and style found within the city, a new area found in the game. It is the only place in any of the games to find villagers who are not residents in the player's town.Role in New Leaf  In New Leaf, the maximum number of villagers in total is ten, though the tenth can only be accessed by either having one move in from a friend's town, using the amiibo cards, or the campsite. Villagers can now both water and plant flowers, shake trees, read the bulletin board and sit on benches and stumps, and in addition pictures and dating gossip are brought back. Other events are also gossiped about, such as when other villagers are planning to move or are ill. Past villagers that have moved out may periodically appear on Main Street. Though these villagers can't be recruited back to the player town from these interactions, they will speak about their time there among other topics. Villagers who have left may return to the town, but only after sixteen other villagers have moved in and then moved out of the town.Agent S  Agent S (2\u3054\u3046, Ni G\u014d?, #2) is a peppy squirrel villager from the Animal Crossing series. She was introduced in the 2003 Japanese exclusive Animal Forest e+, and reappeared in later games in the series. The \"S\" in her name most likely refers to her species, giving her the full title of Agent Squirrel. It is also possible that the \"S\" stands for sidekick, supporting the theory that she is Kid Cat's sidekick, also supported by her catchphrase and Japanese name. She is the second of the five superhero-themed villagers along with\u00a0Kid Cat, Big Top, Rocket, and\u00a0Filly.Appearance  Agent S wears a blue helmet emblazoned with two vertical white stripes that has the number two between them. Her arms and legs appear to be blue with white markings, while her tail is white with a gray swirl. She has half closed circle shaped eyes. Her initial clothing is the No. 2 shirt.Personality  Peppy villagers appear to be in a good mood often, and are easy to become friends with. As a peppy villager, Agent S will have the tendency to over-react in conversations about trivial subjects, and will usually be over-excited to see the player or other villagers. This villager, like other peppy villagers, will rarely be discouraged from doing anything, including the usual hobbies. Peppy villagers dream of becoming famous in the future and read Ms. Nintendique, an unseen magazine read by snooty, normal, and other peppy villagers in the Animal Crossing Series. Peppy villagers will also have a very short attention span, which means they soon forget some arguments or tasks given to the player which were not completed. Agent S may easily get upset in conversation when wrong things are said. She will get along well with other villagers, particularly the lazy, normal, jock, uchi, other peppy villagers, but she may annoy and upset cranky and snooty villagers, whose personalities differ. Due to the nature of peppy villagers, she may mention how \"old\" or \"boring\" cranky villagers are compared to her opposing, upbeat personality.House  In\u00a0Animal Forest e+, Agent S has the same furniture styling as Rhoda's house, only that she has changed the wallpaper to the tree wallpaper and the flooring to stone tile. There is a dice stereo by the left window that plays either K.K. Cruisin' or K.K. Western. She owns many econo chairs which are placed all around the house. In the bottom right, there is a regal vanity by a ruby-econo chair. In Wild World, Agent S owns many items from the Cabana Series, including the lamp, the bookcase, and the bed, the latter of which being situated in the middle of the room. She also owns a Classic Clock, a harp, and a birdcage. She also owns a High-End Stereo, which plays the song K.K. Cruisin'. Her choice of wallpaper is the Cityscape Wall, and her flooring is the Mosaic Tile. In City Folk, Agent S' house is extremely similar to her Wild World house, with the only difference being that most of the furniture has been moved around. In New Leaf, Agent S' house has more of a jock theme to it. She has the default basement wallpaper and flooring. In addition to this, she also owns a few boxing themed items, some examples being the boxing mat and the blue corner. She also owns a claw-foot bathtub, a drip pail, and a clothes closet. Agent S also owns a CD Player, which plays DJ K.K., unlike her previous two appearances, where she had K.K. Cruisin'.Normal  Normal villagers (\u666e\u901a Futs\u016b, or \u79c1\u00a0Watashi) (sometimes called sweet or sweetie villagers) are female characters in the Animal Crossing series. The name comes from their neutral opinion on things such as hobbies and other characters such as the player, villagers, and special visitors. They are often kind to the player. As of now, there are 71 normal villagers, making them the most common female personality.Characteristics  Normal villagers, despite being called \"normal,\" have a lack of self-worth, where they feel self-depreciative. They also appear slightly obsessive with cleanliness and hygiene - a trait also found in peppy villagers. They do not, however, appear to show any concern for their physical appearance, making them happy with what they have. In Wild World, they talk about a friend called Moppina, a non-present mop which reflects on their clean-obsessive nature. They can also have a conversation with a peppy villager about Moppina, which the peppy villager may find funny. They get along very well with every villager and will usually talk about other villagers instead of talking about themselves and their problems. However, They will occasionally talk about themselves and their personal issues. If a normal villager stays in the player's town for a long period of time, she will get rid of all her furniture and when she does leave, she will announce to leave \"empty handed, and without anything.\" Normal villagers have the easiest time getting along with smug, lazy and other normal villagers, and sometimes even snooty villagers. However, they make each other sad or even angry during a conversation. They may conflict with cranky villagers due to their rude, arrogant, and sour nature. The male equivalent of normal villagers are lazy villagers, who display many similar characteristics to them, including their caring and friendly nature that both personalities share. They are the mother-like characters in the town, appearing friendly, sweet, and hospitable towards the player and other villagers. They like to use French expressions, too. In the original Animal Crossing, the normal villagers will wake up at 5:00 A.M. and go to sleep at 9:00 P.M. In Wild World, and City Folk, they wake at 5:00 A.M and go to sleep at 1:00 A.M. In New Leaf, they wake up at 6:00 A.M. and go to sleep at 12:00 A.M. They are very rarely (if at all) angry and tend to take insults and disappointment personally, but will apologize even though they may not have done anything. They also seem to enjoy cooking and will often ask the player about food. In Happy Home Designer, normal villagers got more focused on fashion and style, reading a lot of books about, they got also sillier than before, resembling the peppy personality.Quotes  Below are some (not all) quotes made by normal villagers.Trivia Redd  Redd (\u3064\u306d\u304d\u3061, Tsunekichi?), also known as Crazy Redd, is an untrustworthy kitsune, or fox. He runs Crazy Redd's, an illicit furniture store in the Animal Crossing series, where he is known to sell counterfeit paintings and over-priced items. Certain items sold are considered \"special\" Redd items, which have an HRA bonus. He has a sneaky, sleazy, crafty, and sarcastic personality. When the player leaves his store without buying anything, he will say 'thanks a lot...' in a sarcastic way. But if the player does buy something, he will give them a sincere thank you. He is thought to be 35 in Wild World, as two passwords state Redd is that age. He considers Tom Nook as competition, referring to him as \"that raccoon in an apron.\"Profession  Through the Animal Crossing series, Redd owns small businesses that makes most of its profits by over-charging its customers. Unlike Tom Nook, Redd charges for admission into some of his shops and on an invite-only basis. He tends to pressure players into buying his wares by concocting stories and lying about his products.Role In Animal Crossing  In Animal Crossing, Crazy Redd owns a tent suspiciously labelled the \"Black Market\" - the \"Black\" being crossed out clumsily in red marker. His name could be a reference to this, making it the \"Redd\" Market. When he shows up in town, Redd sends the player a letter telling them the date at which he will arrive. On this date, the player will have to wander around town until finding him in a random spot. He will occasionally sell paintings. Unlike in other games, Redd has a \"B\" (possibly standing for \"black\", as in \"black market\") on his apron.  Redd also runs a stand during the Fireworks Show, where he sells novelty items, such as balloons and pinwheels.Wild World  In Wild World, Redd appears once a week on a specific day (which the player can choose by speaking with Lyle) and sets his tent up outside the Town Hall. On the first week of his arrival, the player will not know the password required to enter, and so will have to ask the villagers. A random villager will have the password, not necessarily the closest friend of the player. After reciting the password correctly to Redd, the tent will open and allow the player in. The player will then be asked to pay 3,000 Bells in order to use his store. If they do not agree to this, the player will not be allowed to purchase anything, and will have to inquire with the villagers next week for another password. Once the player becomes a member of his \"family\", Redd will send them a weekly letter, received on the day before he arrives, with a new password. It is believed that Redd is in cahoots with an Lyle who offers forgery insurance. Insurance can only be bought weekly at a price which does not cover for the cost of buying a forged painting, meaning both Lyle and Redd have made a profit at the expense of the player. This belief is also upheld by how Redd knows the day of the week on which he should come to the town, which matches with the day the player selected when talking to Lyle. Redd's age is implied by a password to be 35, though this is never verified.City Folk  In City Folk, Redd owns a small shop on the left of the city, in what villagers call a \"dark alley\". To get into his shop, a villager or friend would need to send an invitation to the player. This replaces the secret password in Wild World. After buying something, Redd will give the player an invitation to send to other players - If they visit Redd's, he would give 1,000 Bells to the player. The entry fee is 3,000 Bells. Redd changes his inventory every Wednesday. He appears to have no connection with Lyle, who now runs the Happy Room Academy in the city. Therefore, insurance does not exist and any forgeries cannot be refunded at all. Most of the time when he guarantees its value, it's real.New Leaf  In New Leaf, Redd returns to the tent business, setting up in the Event Plaza. He specializes in the art department now, only selling paintings and the newly added statues. Some paintings and statues are always genuine, but most can be forgeries. However, forgeries now have noticeable cosmetic differences from the real version to make it less luck-based. The fake versions of the normal items are a separate collectable item. Unlike the statues there are certain paintings which are now always genuine. His store runs on a \"one-a-day\" policy, where he only allows customers to buy one item per day. To prevent loopholes, any item purchased from Redd in one town counts in all others, therefore ensuring that a single player can only purchase a single item from him each day. He also mails purchases to the player's mailbox the following day, rather than giving the purchases to the player straightaway (marking purchased artwork with a special note).\u00a0 He also appears at New Year's Eve and Fireworks Show at the plaza, where he sells hats for 300 Bells at the former and Redd's Cookies for 500 bells at the latter.In Animal Crossing The Movie  Redd appears in D\u014dbutsu no Mori, where he tricks Yu and Alfonso into buying a fake Golden Slingshot during the Fireworks Show, for which he charged them 3,500 bells. Redd insists that the Golden Slingshot is one of a kind, while in reality he had an entire box filled with them in his tent.Super Smash Bros. Brawl  In Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Redd can both be seen as a trophy, and as a spectator in Smashville.Trophy Information  The owner and proprietor of Crazy Redd's Emporium, which sells furniture acquired on the black market. It's said he's famous in the underworld. He drops by once a week and sets up his tent in front of the town hall. His shop's full of rare items, but the prices are high. It's open until midnight, an hour longer than Tom Nook's place, which pleases night players.Trivia Coelacanth  The coelacanth (\u30b7\u30fc\u30e9\u30ab\u30f3\u30b9, Sh\u012brakansu?) (pronunciation: /\u02c8si\u02d0.l\u0259.k\u00e6n\u03b8/ 'seel-uh-canth') is an extremely rare saltwater fish that has appeared in every main Animal Crossing series game. In Animal Forest, this was the only fish to appear in the ocean. Unlike any other fish in the series, the coelacanth can only appear when it is raining or snowing, and it is the only fish to spawn in this unique manner. Despite the fact that it can rain on the island in New Leaf, it cannot be caught there, though it can be caught on the island in Animal Crossing. In Animal Forest e+, the coelacanth can only be encountered once per play session, even if it isn't caught.Donation To The museum  As with all fish caught in Animal Crossing series, the coelacanth can be donated to the museum by talking to Blathers.In Animal Crossing  Blathers will say: \"Hoo, my goodness! Glorious! Seen in this light, of course, it's quite a grotesque beast. And yet, it does have a certain peculiar allure, wot? You may rest assured that we shall treat it with much affection and respect, wot! My word as a gentleowl.\"In Wild World  Blathers will comment: \"It was once thought that the coelacanth had gone extinct, eh wot? Indeed, right up until a scholar saw them lined up in a market. Hoo hoo! That would clearly suggest that they are edible, don't you agree? Though I must admit, they don't look like they would taste very good...\"In City Folk  Blathers will say the following when given the coelacanth: \"Many years ago, the theory was that the coelacanth had gone extinct...But as it turns out, it still exists and has been living deep in the ocean this whole time, wot? Imagine! This fish has known the world since the dinosaurs... Perhaps it's the true master of the sea!\"In New Leaf  The description plate in the museum will say the following: \"Coelacanths are ancient fish once believed to be extinct but recently discovered around South Africa. Called \"living fossils,\" they have apparently changed very little over the past 400 million years. They can live for over 60 years and reach lengths of six feet but have rather small brains, even for fish. They have more fins and harder scales than the average fish, making them a rather resilient breed. Their flavor is very different from most fish, and they contain a fat that is indigestible by humans. It's for that second reason that eating them really isn't highly recommended.\"Further information  The coelacanth is a type of fish that was thought to have gone extinct long ago until it was rediscovered in 1938 off the coast of South Africa. It is considered to have evolved into its current form over 400 million years ago. They are large fish that can grow up to 1.8m in length. They are mostly active at night, between the depths of 100 and 500m, and feed mostly on fish that they come across. Whilst little remains known about the life of the coelacanth, they have been observed to have shark bite scars, suggesting they are prey to the large predators of the deep ocean.Trivia GracieGrace  GracieGrace is a high-end furniture store in City Folk and New Leaf, owned by Gracie, the giraffe fashionista. It is located in the city in City Folk, where it is run by the estranged Able sister, Labelle, and in T&T Emporium in New Leaf, where Gracie herself runs it, as Labelle works at the Able Sisters. All of the furniture that Gracie sells are many times more expensive than those in Tom Nook's store or the Nookling stores, with many items selling for over 200,000 Bells each. In addition to furniture, Gracie also sells clothing and accessories, which are not as expensive as the furniture. Villagers are often seen in GracieGrace, where they will complain about the high prices.Furniture  GracieGrace's furniture and clothes change seasonally, unlike Tom Nook's or the Able Sisters, which change daily.Sales  There is a sale at the end of every season. They are as follows:In City Folk  During the sales period, items may disappear and be replaced with a \"sold out\" sign, much like at Tom Nook's Store. This suggests that some villagers have bought things, though this cannot be seen by the player. The player is also able to obtain a further 10% discount by presenting to Gracie a complete look. The discount is available for as long as the player is in the store.In New Leaf  In New Leaf items can still sell out, but various other items will appear like the wedding cake or furniture from the Card Series. Additionally, the clothing sections will be replaced with similar exclusives. These items are all new to New Leaf and can only be found during the end of season sales.Trivia ", "Dead Rising Wiki": "Dead Rising Wiki Dead Rising 2 Recipes  In certain locations, Chuck Greene can find Blenders. Combine two food items in the Blender and Chuck will get a special type of juice back. There are nine varieties of Juices, and each has a \"special\" or \"power-up\" effect on Chuck. These effects range from useful effects such as making Chuck temporarily invincible to oddball abilities, such as allowing Chuck to spit fire (Spitfire). All of these Juices restore large amounts of health in addition to providing certain effects, and Chuck can use any of them as an ingredient in the Blender to make another type of juice. NOTE: All recipe combinations are found here: Dead Rising 2 Recipes/AllHow to mix two items in a blender  In order to mix two items together in a blender Chuck must first switch items in his inventory until he gets to the first ingredient. With the ingredient in hand go to the blender, and when the yellow indicator is highlighted and tells you to \"Examine\" the blender. This puts Chuck's first item in the blender. Chuck cannot get the item back out once he puts it in. To add the second food item switch to the food item and Examine the blender again. The blender will whirl, then spit out a colored thermos-looking container. The color is indicative of the Juice Chuck made, and it will have the name in parenthesis when Chuck walks close enough to it.Two mixed drinks  Chuck can use two drinks at the same time.Number of available combinations  Below is the number of available mixed juice combinations:Recipes  NOTE: All recipe combinations are found here: Dead Rising 2 Recipes/All By combining two items in a blender, Chuck can create mixtures that will give him special abilities for a short time.See also Vehicles (Dead Rising 2)  Vehicles are transportation in Dead Rising 2. Traditional vehicles: Non-traditional transport or pushable objects: Anything that Chuck can push makes him travel faster than usual. Stand behind these pushable items and a push command will appear. Chuck travels quickly through groups of zombies when pushing weapons.Vehicle key locations  Chuck needs to locate special keys to unlock and start most cars and bikes.Vehicle modifications  After defeating the psychopath Leon Bell in the Meet the Contestants mission Chuck acquires a key to Leon's Combo Bay and a green motorbike. The motorbike, located in the Combo Bay on the Silver Strip\u2019s north end, will respawn every time Chuck enters another area with a load screen. The motorbike is the only vehicle that Chuck can customize with new paint jobs. Chuck can't paint the Chopper. The following is a list of every item which Chuck can combine with the bike.External links  Water GunDead Rising 2 Clothing  Chuck has several clothing options in Still Creek and Fortune City. Clothing found in the game does not give Chuck any extra benefits. Except, however, if one equips the full Knight's Armor set, granting extra health. Pre-Order Bonus (ninja outfit and sports fan outfit) and Dead Rising 2 High Stakes Edition (psycho costume) clothing does give Chuck extra abilities.List of clothes  Gray means also in Case Zero.Trivia Clothing with the same name  There is at least one clothing itemwith the same name as in Dead Rising:Dead Rising 2  Dead Rising 2 is a survival horror video game with action adventure and role-playing game elements. The game is the sequel to the 2006 video game Dead Rising. It is being developed, in partnership with Dead Rising developer Capcom, by Blue Castle Games and will be distributed by Capcom. The Original Dead Rising team members will return to create the game, including Keiji Inafune, head of Research & Development at Capcom. Originally set to be released in the beginning of 2010, the game's release has been pushed back to September 28th in North America and October 1st in Europe.Plot  The game is set 5 years after the events of the original Dead Rising. The zombie parasite that originated in Santa Cabeza and caused the Willamette outbreak has spread all over the United States. This is due to the 50 orphans scattered throughout the United States who had been injected with the parasite; subjecting them to zombification and infecting the rest of the US (This can be told through Overtime Mode upon achieving the A-Rank ending in Dead Rising 1). The game will take place in the fictional setting of Fortune City, which is modeled after the real-life city of Las Vegas, Nevada. Chuck Greene, a former national motocross champion, is somehow caught in the middle of the zombie apocalypse in Fortune City. Just like Frank West (the player-character from the original Dead Rising), Chuck will face a number of zombie hordes as well as surviving psychopaths, and surviving civilians whom he may choose to save. Among the survivors in Fortune City is Chuck's own daughter, Katey Greene, who was infected by her mother in the Vegas outbreak. Katey serves as Chuck's primary motivation for battling the undead. He tries to earn money to keep his daughter on the infection supressant \"Zombrex\" introduced in the original Dead Rising as the synthetic Frank West was using. Inafune mentioned in an interview that part of Chuck's quest will force him to participate in the violent game show, \"Terror is Reality\".Gameplay  The gameplay remains similar to Dead Rising with the player controlling protagonist Chuck Greene as he fights off hordes of zombies while accomplishing specific missions. The game will include several new objects that can be used to attack the zombies. The number of zombies which can be seen onscreen at any one time has also been dramatically increased from 800 in the original to roughly 6,000. According to Inafune, the new protagonist will be more \"interesting\" than the previous hero, Frank West. There will also be a greater variety of missions for the player to undertake, and the sequel will retain the original's time management mechanic. However, the original game's photography mechanic will not be present in Dead Rising 2. Instead, Dead rising 2 will feature a brand new mechanic that allows players to manufacture their own custom weapons at various points in the game. The player will also be able to purchase 'cards', that will reveal item combinations that could prove deadly after being built. Such combinations include:Cooperative  It has been confirmed during Captivate '10 that cooperative gameplay in the story campaign will be available. An online cooperative mode will be available, but according to Blue Castle Games, there will be no offline co-op mode. Both players will play as the main character, Chuck Greene, and will be able to earn experience and keep the items they collected throughout the game, but only the host player will be able to save the game's progress. A host can invite a friend to join in the current game progress by sending out an invitation, if the friend accepts a confirmation icon will be displayed and the host can allow the player to join in. Non-host players can drop in/out of a co-op game anytime they want. When both players are separated in different directions, a tiny animated Chuck Greene icon will appear at the bottom of the game screen. The icon will show what the other player is up to, whether it be attacking or being assaulted by zombies. If a player is taken down by zombies, he/she will be able to call the other for help to revive them. The player will use food to revive the dying partner before his/her health bar runs out.Multiplayer  Online Co-Op features 2 players working together. Terror is Reality mode can host 4 players online. Speaking at Captivate '09, Keiji Inafune confirmed that Dead Rising 2 will include multiplayer, but refused to state what the mode would entail. \"We're at a point in game history that you need to have some form of multiplayer component in a game. Single-player alone is not going to cut it. So rest assured we are going to put multiplayer in the game, but I can\u2019t go into specifics about what type of multiplayer as that directly relates to some of the game systems that we don\u2019t want to talk about at this event. It will be online multiplayer, so keep that in mind.\" During the 2009 Tokyo Game Show, Capcom revealed that the multiplayer of Dead Rising 2 will take the form of a reality TV show called \"Terror is Reality\" in which players will act as contestants in a fictitious gameshow. Up to four players are available in multiplayer, where they compete against each other for the most kills inside an arena full of undead. Players will be able to use weapons and vehicles including human-sized hamster balls and chainsaw-equipped motorcycles. They also will be able to prevent other players from scoring by using various forms of \"dirty\" tactics. The multiplayer mode has been compared to the television show American Gladiators. Recently, Blue Castle Games and Capcom revealed that the game would feature a free roaming Co-op mode. However, little information has been released. This might be one of the causes of the game being delayed up to late 2010s.Endings Ending F  Method 1: Method 2:Ending D  Method 1: Method 2:Ending C Ending B Ending A Ending S Development  The sequel was announced on February 9, 2009, confirming earlier rumors of the game's existence, as well as a viral video for the game. The developers Blue Castle Games worked with Keiji Inafune, the game's producer and Capcom's global head of research and development, along with other Dead Rising team members. The technology behind Dead Rising 2 was written from scratch by Blue Castle Games, with no code porting from the previous game.Marketing  Capcom has created a variety of websites before the release of this game. These include TapeorDie.Com, visitfortunecity.com, and deadrising-2.com. In August 2010, Keiji Inafune released an eight part video series entitled Zombrex: Dead Rising Sun. Capcom is set to sponsor a gathering of zombies at the London House of Parliament on August 30 - and the best dressed will win a games console. Attendees will also receive a limited edition, one-of-a-kind t-shirt. The inaugural General Election campaign will be attended by Citizens for Undead Rights and Equality (CURE), an equal rights group campaigning for the rights of zombies.Collectible editions  There are several collectible retail copies. The standard edition includes the game and a manual and will be available for the Xbox 360, PS3, and PC only. The Zombrex Edition is only available for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 consoles, and includes a fake syringe of the Zombrex medicine featured in the game plot, along with an accompanying safety information card, a Zombrex-labeled steelcase, a sales brochure, and a prescription pad. The Xbox 360 version comes with the Zombrex Dead Rising Sun movie whereas the PlayStation 3 version contains a voucher for a Dead Rising 2 XrossMediaBar dynamic theme and a behind the scenes featurette. The Outbreak Pack, available for any system, but exclusive to Europe, features a red box and contains a zombie figurine and some accessories for the figurine. A limited run of 700 copies was also announced for Australia.Case Zero  Case Zero will be an Xbox 360-exclusive download. It will be available on the Xbox Live Marketplace priced at 400 Microsoft Points. It will develop the plot in between the two main games and will act as the demo for Dead Rising 2. The story takes place three years before the events of Dead Rising 2 and involves Chuck and Katey's first large-scale adventure against the horde of zombies after escaping Las Vegas. The player can reach up to level five in Case Zero, after which the player may carry over his experience and cash earned into Dead Rising 2. The release date for Case Zero is set for August 31st, 2010 in North America and September 3rd in Europe.Reception  Dead Rising 2 has been met with generally positive reviews. Both the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 versions of the game received ratings of 80 by the review compiler Metacritic. IGN, Eurogamer, and GamesRadar have given the game an 8 out of 10, praising the story, combat, and huge numbers of enemies on screen, while complaining about long loading times. Platform Nation wrote, \"What I love about Dead Rising 2 is that it feels more Smoother.\" In regards to the games difficulty, the Telegraph newspaper wrote, \"I found myself having to restart the game a few times, and it was only when I hit level 20 that I could start to do all the missions comfortably, with plenty of time for the optional quests as well as the main story. For some perspective, I never had to restart the original game due to failing the story on my first playthrough, so if anything Dead Rising 2 is less forgiving, the time limits tighter, and the amount of objectives greater.\"PC system requirements  Minimum PC System RequirementsSee also External links  Template:D2Dead Rising 2 Mods  Dead Rising 2 Mods, short for modifications, is software for the PC version of Dead Rising 2 which adds in extra options.

No longer do survivors stand around like cretins, advertising themselves as free lunch. In Dead Rising 2 they put up a fight. They're basically invincible, at least until you thwack them accidentally (and repeatedly) over the head with a wrench. If zombies grab them, they'll fight them off. They'll push their way through the crowd. And most relieving of all, they can actually follow Chuck in a competent manner, instead of getting stuck on walls, signs, or discarded Servebot (sic) heads. Their pathfinding is excellent, and other than occasionally being left in the previous area and forcing you to navigate two lengthy loading screens to get them back, they provide none of the headaches that the Willamette survivors induced.\"External links Missions  Missions appear in Dead Rising 2 and Dead Rising 2: Case Zero. They are equivalent to Dead Rising Scoops. Missions are side quests which are not required to complete the game. As with cases, missions are time based. Usually a time gauge appears along the right side of the screen when a mission is uncovered. Most missions require Chuck Greene to find and rescue survivors and return them to a safe house. In return Chuck receives prestige points and sometimes money from the survivors.Dead Rising 2 missions  There are 50 missions available in Dead Rising 2.

It costs $25,000 for Chuck to play . Each time a player loses all of their cash, they also remove a piece of clothing.Trivia  It has to be noted this mission is the only way to get an unlockable piece of clothing, Arthur's helmet. To get it you first need to save Jack Ellis during the mission \"Welcome to the family\". Then when you beat every player during the poker game, the helmet will be unlocked and appear in your wardrobe.External links  Template:D2Combo Weapons  Combo weapons are Dead Rising 2 and Dead Rising 2: Case Zero weapons that are created by combining two items with copious amounts of duct tape. They can only be created in Maintenance Rooms. Combo weapons can also be purchased from pawnshops such as Still Creek Pawnshop, Just in Time Payday Loans, or Moe's Maginations. Combo Cards are most commonly acquired by leveling up, they identify how to make the weapon, unlock special more damaging attacks, and give Chuck more prestige points when killing zombies. When a combo weapon is created without the combo card being unlocked, a scratch card is obtained instead. The scratch card will record how the weapon is made, but the special attacks and extra prestige points are not available.Tips Zombrex  Ambuzol Vaspilatin which is commercially marketed as Zombrex, is a medicine in both Dead Rising and Dead Rising 2 that retards the process of becoming undead. In Dead Rising 2: Case Zero it should be taken every 12 hours but in the main Dead Rising 2, three years later, Zombrex's development has advanced, giving it a 24 hour effectiveness. By Dead Rising 2, the pill can be taken orally in 200 mg doses. Zombrex is a subsidiary of Phenotrans. Zombrex is expensive. This is because phenotrans has and continues to have high research and development costs. This cost is passed on to the pharmacies, which is passed on to the consumer. The government subsides this cost. Zombrex also does not require a prescription which leads to hoarding. People have been known to feed their pets Zombrex to stop zombification.Zombrex locations  See #Video below for a walk through of hidden Zombrex.Background  The drug that Frank helped Isabela make in overtime in Dead Rising is actually Zombrex.

A series of cinematics make it clear that Chuck is a contestant on Terror Is Reality XVII: Payback, competing for money towards his daughter's much-needed doses of Zombrex. The player must finish a round of TIR before advancing on towards the open world of Fortune City. Whether the player come in first or last only affects the amount of reward money they receive. In either case, characters still remain \"disappointed\" in Chuck's performance, as they all know he does not enjoy competing. After he washes up and changes, Chuck goes looking for his daughter as well as some more Zombrex. The elevator is disabled from a sudden explosion and Chuck crawls out into the zombie-infested hallways behind the arena. The player must find Katey, who is hiding in a locker in the Green Room, and escape the arena in search of the Safe Room. After leaving the arena, a cutscene follows of Chuck and Katey making it to the Safe Room and meeting some key characters of the game, including Stacey Forsythe and Raymond Sullivan. Chuck quickly realizes that he has no Zombrex, as there is no supply in the Safe Room, and Katey will need some soon.Zombrex 1  Tips\u00a0: For killing looters, Sledgehammer is proving to be best weapon. Grab one when entering Royal Flush Plaza. Katey has been infected since the outbreak in Las Vegas and she needs a dose of Zombrex every 24 hours to stay alive. Without any in hand, Chuck must venture out into the zombie-infested Fortune City. There is a pharmacy in Roy's Mart, at the east side of Royal Flush Plaza, which may have Zombrex. The player must travel to Roy's Mart, find Zombrex, and return it to Katey between 7:00 and 8:00am. Identical to all days, this task is split into two parts, Find Katey Zombrex and once the Zombrex is found, Katey will need Zombrex. At Roy's Mart, a cutscene shows three Looters ransacking the place for valuables and terrorizing the pharmacist for a safe. Chuck interrupts them asking for Zombrex. The looters close in on him asking him for money. The player must kill all three looters in order to find the Pharmacy Key, which unlocks the room behind the counter, where a dose of Zombrex is on the table. From here, the player has the option of whether or not to save Denyce, the pharmacist. Chuck will receive a 5,000 PP Join Bonus and if she makes it back to the Safe Room alive, an additional 10,000 PP Escort Bonus. A cutscene follows of Sullivan asking Chuck where he found the survivor(s) and Chuck tells him that there are more. Sullivan tells Chuck he doesn't want any infected getting into the Safe Room. After this, depending on how much time the player spent out of the Safe Room, Katey may be due for her next dose of Zombrex. After she is given the injection, Case 1-1: Big News begins.Case 1 Case 1-1: Big News  After giving Katey her daily dose of Zombrex, a cinematic follows of Chuck as he grabs himself a cup of coffee. Stacey Forsythe is watching the news as reporter Rebecca Chang broadcasts live from the Fortune City Hotel. She speculates that the outbreak occurred inside the Fortune City Arena during last night's TIR show. Security footage plays of a man wiring explosives to a gate holding back zombies, the gate exploding, and the zombies pouring into the hallways behind the arena. She says that the suspect is reported to be Chuck Greene, member of the zombie rights portest group CURE. Chuck is shocked by the report, as is Stacey. He tries to calm her and assure her that he is innocent and if he can find Rebecca Chang, he can prove it.Case 1-2: Alive on Location  As Chuck is leaving the safe house, Sullivan gives him the maintenance room key. As Chuck is walking down the hallway between the Safe House and Royal Flush Plaza, another cutscene shows with zombies in the corridor. In a cutscene, the game shows Chuck how to build his first combo weapon, the Spiked Bat.Case 1-3: Insecurity  Full walkthrough with cutscenes Case 1-3: Insecurity. Chuck follows Rebecca Chang to the security room to see the security tapes there. In the security room, the staff has been killed and any evidence destroyed. Stacey calls to tell Chuck that he needs to return to the Safe House. Sullivan has seen Chuck on television and is threatening to kick Katey out of the safe house.Case 1-4: Alliance  Full walkthrough with cutscenes Case 1-4: Alliance. Return to the safe house from the security room Rebecca showed Chuck in Case 1-3. Sullivan is concerned about Chuck and CURE's involvement in the zombie outbreak. Rebecca enters the safe house. After Sullivan leaves Stacey, Chuck, and Rebecca enter an alliance. Stacey will continue to monitor the cameras, while Rebecca and Chuck will attempt to find out how the zombie breach occurred.Case 2 Case 2-1: Sign of Life  Stacey calls Chuck and asks him to come back to the security room, because Stacey is a worried about Katey. Chuck returns to check on Katey, who is asleep on the couch. As Stacey and Chuck are talking, Stacey notices movement on the security camera. Several organized men appear to be moving equipment in the underground tunnels. Chuck says, \"It's a lead - the only one we've got. It could be whoever's doing this to us,\" and decides to examine it further.Case 2-2: Ticket to Ride  Chuck arrives just as Tyrone King is exiting a train. Tyrone orders his three mercenaries to take care of Chuck and closes a metal gate. After Chuck defeats the three mercenaries, he throws a fourth mercenary off his bike. The bike breaks through the gate. Chuck retrieves the bike and chases after Tyrone's train. Chuck takes a ramp and jumps onto the train. He battles several more mercenaries. At the head of the train Chuck confronts Tyrone. Tyrone admits to framing Chuck. He then unlatches the engine from the rest of the train, and beginnings shooting at Chuck. The unlatched wagons comes to a stop and Stacey calls, asking Chuck's status. He explains that Tyrone framed him. Stacey responds that his concern should be Katey's daily Zombrex dose. Chuck finds a key on the ground next to the train wagon.Zombrex 2  Zombrex can also be obtained from the Side Mission Code Blue where Chuck finds Sven Blaaborg at One Little Duck Bingo trying to give CPR to Tim Duggan. After getting him to the bunker, he will give Chuck one zombrex dose. Other hidden zombrex locations can be found on the Zombrex page, which includes a video.Case 3  Case 3 is where things really start to heat up in Dead Rising 2. You'll need to take out TK's Mercenaries before they rob the vaults of the main casinos. Below are key points in finding the mercenaries, and helpful tips on quick ways of getting them out of the way. Remember, you need to destroy the drills!Case 3-1: Boom Town  This is a big mission and you'll Definitely want to get it As SOON as possible. Note that it is basically a background mission that you can do in parts, so pick it up quickly and try and finish it throughout the day of gameplay. You also have enough time to save some citizens in the mean time.Case 3-2: Run for the Money  Pretty simple in concept and in execution. There are mercenaries trying to break into the casino vaults across Fortune City. You need to kill the mercenaries and destroy their drilling machines. Remember you really need to try and do these throughout the day. Don\u2019t wait until the last minute, because you will receive a fourth heist once you destroy the third. You will not recieve any extension to your time. So don't wait! get it done and out of the way. The actual process is pretty clear. There are mercenaries set up in the Cashier\u2019s Rooms in the Yucatan, Slots Ranch and the Americana.You\u2019ll be able to spot the mercenaries by looking for and/or hearing their gunfire. The two door guards will have to hold off the nearby zombies. Each Cashier room should have two door guards and at least Three to Five guards inside. They all have mercenary assault rifles, (Which is amazing for survivor 'Left 4 Dead' groups, Esp with the Leadership magazine.)  The best way to destroy and get mercenaries out of the way, because we all know, they're annoying! If you have gotten the combo card (Or haven't) grab a fire axe and a sledge hammer. Fire axe can be found inside the safe house near the control room, and the sledgehammer can be find close to the first maintenance room, It creates the Defiler which is an AMAZING two-hander, kind of slow, but extremely powerful. It can One-shot the mercenaries and it gets them out of the way, It is also Wonderful for destroying the drill extremely quickly.Case 4  Case 4 in DR2 just boils down to a unique psychopath fight. You will need to kill the Katana wielding twins in the Shoal Nightclub above the Yucatan in order to save Rebecca Chang from her \"Source.\" IF you need help killing the twins, Just look below!Case 4-1: The Source  This is basically just a psychopath fight and less of a story mission. You will need to prepare for it, since I've heard most people are having trouble killing the Twins. It's actually really easy to kill Amber and Crystal Bailey if you know what you're doing. Mix up a few 'Painkillers' before the fight (I say about 2) if you want to make things easy you can do this at Juggz on the Platinum strip or the Americana casino. But honestly, you could probably get by just drinking all the alcohol around the Shoal club during the fight. (Remember though, 3 beers for Chuck equals Puking Party.) Bring Shotguns, Shotguns do amazing damage to the girls, you're also next to the Palisades Mall, so if you need shotguns, there is the Open range gun store. Bring a Decent melee weapon as well. A nail bat or knife gloves should be fine. If you can, find the LMG (along with a zombrex) in the middle of the Yucatan Casino (the location is shown in a video in Zombrex 2.) Then find the Robot bear inside the Yucatan Casino, go find the Maintenance room and create 'Freedom Bear!' Freedom Bear is Godly to this fight, place it in a corner, while looking at Rebecca (you'll know what I mean) and just run around rebecca all day if you want, just careful, those twins are Kong Fu crazy! Killing the twins: They only have on real attack, They both use Katanas and attack in unison (Or.. try to do so). The two run around in opposite directions around the club and try to meet in the center for an attack run. If you don't roll or jump out of the way, then they will knock Chuck down and take away a block or two of health. They'll also run away before you can get up. And sometimes, they'll step on his Crotch. You only need to kill one of the twins, Which makes it even easier! You just need to Tunnel vision one target! Hurray! Remember, Freedom bear is extremely amazing in this fight, just place it properly and it's an easy win.Zombrex 3  Already a video on the Zombrex location on the Zombrex page. But besides that you can buy zombrex from the Pawn shops, they cost a hefty amount. There is a magazine called \"Bargaining 1\" which reduces the cost of the Pawn shop items by 10%.Case 5  Case 5 is the quick wrap-up to the normal mode of DR2. Completing case 5 will complete the first section of the story and unlock the first major part of overtime mode. if you need help stopping TK's helicopter, just look below for useful tips.Case 5-1: Stake Out  Need to get to the Safehouse rooftop to see where TK's helicopter lands, All you need to do is show up on time, extremely easy. Don't be late!Case 5-2: The Getaway  TK is trying to get away in a helicopter and we need to stop him. This is a really quick fight once you have the tactics down. Go ahead and make a few painkillers at Juggz on the Platinum Strip if you don't already have some. It's good to be able to heal in case you make a mistake in the helicopter battle. The helicopter battle is actually REALLY easy as soon as you get the rhythm. The helicopter starts out right next to the winch and it's at your level. It will overpower the winch with a little effort and swing around in front so that the machine gunner will fire at you. It will also sometimes curve over to the side of the rooftop. The only way to damage the helicopter is by throwing things at it. There's plenty of stuff on the rooftop so you should be fine. Aim for the rotor to be sure that you hit it. Hitting the button on the winch will reel the helicopter back down to your level for some easy and free damage. It is STILL possible to hit the rotor while the helicopter is free though. If you need health, there is some food near Rebecca Chang.Zombrex 4  On the Sub mission Mail Order Zombrex, you defeat a psychopath and gain a zombrex which adds to the collection. Video to show how to defeat him if you're having problems.The Facts  Sullivan has escaped the Safe House and is fleeing Fortune City with the evidence that can clear Chuck's name. As the player enters the maintenance area in Royal Flush Plaza a countdown shows up on screen labeled: TIME UNTIL FIRE BOMB. A cutscene after the player exits the maintenance hallway shows Chuck running out into Royal Flush Plaza, calling Stacey, and telling her that he's lost Sullivan. Stacey replies negatively, but tells Chuck she'll keep looking. An urgent message from Stacey eventually comes in on the transceiver, telling Chuck that she saw Sullivan heading for Fortune Park. If the player is beyond this, a message comes in, telling Chuck that Sullivan is trying to break open the locked elevators in the Yucatan Casino. Chuck must travel to the Yucatan if he is not already there, find the open elevator located in the back near the restrooms, and take it to the roof. Exiting the elevator, Chuck is just below the rooftop where Sullivan is escaping. The player must move through the zombie infested room, up the stairs, and outside. A cutscene follows of Chuck confronting Sullivan, who is suiting up for a surface-to-air recovery or a Skyhook. Sullivan explains what the purpose of the Fortune City operation was. It becomes clear that Phenotrans, in order to keep a constant supply of Zombrex, plans on purposely causing outbreaks in order to harvest Queens. Chuck examines the ironic nature of this, as while they are attempting to save lives, they are killing just as many in the process. It is also explained that Tyrone King's heist was out of his own greed and his only task in the operation was to pinpoint a scapegoat. At the end of the cutscene, Chuck realizes that Phenotrans was also responsible for the Las Vegas outbreak and the death of his wife, as well as the infection of his daughter. In response Sullivan exclaims, \"Everything that we have done has been absolutely necessary!\" After the cutscene, the player must defeat Sullivan, who stays on top of the scaffolding and throws down flares which serve as targets for the plane's missiles. Sullivan also has a handgun, which he will draw when Chuck is near. If Chuck is on the scaffolding, Sullivan will fight and charge him with his bare hands. If the player attempts to attack Sullivan with a melee weapon, Sullivan will grab Chuck slam him to the ground. The equipped weapon will fall out of Chuck's hand and off of the scaffolding as well. Upon defeating Sullivan, a cinematic shows the plane firing upon Chuck, who falls down next to Sullivan on the scaffolding. Sullivan grabs his briefcase and deploys the balloon. He tells Chuck, \"We're the good guys, Chuck. Not You.\" As Sullivan stands, Chuck attaches a carabiner, which is mounted to a railing, to Sullivan's belt. The plane hooks the balloon and Sullivan is mangled upon the scaffolding. Chuck uses Sullivan's phone to call Channel 6 Action News. He tells them who he is and offers \"the scoop of a lifetime\" as long as they send rescue helicopters. The helicopter comes and regardless of how many survivors the player has managed to rescue, only two of the original survivors in the Safe Room board the helicopter. Chuck asks the two survivors if they have seen his daughter, but they haven't. He tells the pilot to leave, because he has to find Katey. Chuck enters the deserted Safe Room and only finds Katey's backpack. 72 hour mode ends and the credits roll.Overtime  Overtime Mode is unlocked by giving Tyrone King Zombrex during 72 Hour Mode. It is a continuation of the story in 72 Hour Mode. Chuck cannot find Katey as the survivors are leaving on a helicopter. He lets the helicopter leave, and returns to the Safe House. As Chuck realizes Katey and Stacey missing, he receives a call from Tyrone, and the game goes into Overtime and extra 24 game hours of game play. If Chuck wants to see Katey and Stacey again, he needs to run a series of fetch-quests for Tyrone around Fortune City. This mode culminates in a boss-fight with Tyrone himself. After collecting all the items, Chuck must go to the Arena. He is knocked out, and wakes up faced with fighting Tyrone, unarmed, while Stacey and Katey are being winched down to a crowd of zombies. Defeating Tyrone results in the best ending, Ending S.Trivia  Frank West is mentioned many times throughout the game.Notes Dead Rising 2: Case Zero Walkthrough  Between Dead Rising and Dead Rising 2 Chuck Greene, flees Vegas with his daughter Katey.

The Brockett Gas Station is a safe house where the game can be saved, where Chuck can escort survivors too, and create combo weapons with the maintenance bench. Katey will wait here the entire game. There are several weapons in this room.Chuck's first Combo Weapon  Chuck has the opportunity to make a Combo Weapon immediately. As the game starts, in front of Chuck is a door. To the left of the door is a Box of Nails and a Baseball Bat. Pick up both the Box of Nails and the Baseball Bat. Walk to the brown maintenance bench.

This room has Orange Juice (to the left on the garage door) and Snacks. Pick up at least one orange juice.Roof of the Safe House  On the roof is a sniper rifle near the front of the store. The roof is reached by a ladder behind the main entrance room counter.Car Scrap Yard  After creating the Spiked Bat and picking up at least one orange juice, exit the garage. The exit Chuck will use is in the garage Katey is in, next to the maintenance bench. The door exits into a car scrap yard, turn left and walk around the derelict cars.Save Game shack  There is a small blue shack at the edge of the Auto Scrap Yard. Enter this shack. A Explanation screen appears explaining saving. In this shack are two doors, one to the left and one directly in front of Chuck. Open the door directly in front of Chuck with the bathroom sign above the door. Here is a bathroom which is a save point. This is one of three save points in Still Creek.Save the game. Switch Chuck to a weapon (using  and ). The other door is to Still Creek. Open the door.Case 0-2: Find Zombrex Information screen  As this case begins an information screen appears which states:Save game  At this point the case file appears and an opportunity to save the game. Save the game.Traveling through the quarantine zone  To avoid zombies, Chuck can jump from car to car in the traffic jam. Jump down and head towards the brown tents and ambulance. The ambulance is on the left.Ambulance cutscene  Open the ambulance door and a cutscene begins.

It explains that:Preparing to return to Still Creek  After the Bike Parts screen, Chuck starts in the garage. You can now look at the Bike Screen on the pause menu to see the parts needed to finish the bike. Create another Spiked Bat if needed and pick up another Orange Juice in the store.Location of five bike part items Bike parts as weapons  Chris' Fine FoodsQueen cutscene  As Chuck leaves the Gas Station Safe House, there is a queen cutscene. The queen acts the same as queens in Dead Rising, the queen violently kills all nearby zombies when it is killed.Wheel: Save Dick Jones  After the cutscene, a survivor, Dick Jones, is trapped on top of a van, surrounded by zombies.Kill zombies and talk to Dick Jones  Kill most of the zombies around the van. One well placed queen can kill all of the zombies around the van. After most of the zombies are killed, jump on top the van and speak to Dick.Follow Dick Jones to the pawnshop and speak to him  Follow Dick up the street to his pawnshop.In Still Creek Pawnshop  There are 8 items for sale in the Still Creek Pawnshop. Chuck should buy the wheel now. If Chuck does not yet have enough money to buy the wheel, see the next section below. If you want to complete the game and rescue all survivors, Save money and only buy the wheel then the Zombrex.Not enough money to buy the wheel  Chuck begins the game with $2000. If Chuck does not have enough money to purchase the $5,000 wheel yet, walk across the street to the Still Creek Casino. Outside the casino doors is $300 on the ground. Chuck can acquire around $10,200 every trip into Still Creek Casino, which is the fastest way to make money. Play the Barnyard Bonanza clusters 5 times each (each play costs $100) for 5 guaranteed wins (pays out $300; total net gain of $1000 per cluster). This does not work on the Trouble With Turkeys slot machines, and Chuck will lose your money if he plays them. After playing those slot machines, break the slot machines, cash registers, and ATMs. Keep in mind that all of the money inside and outside respawns (reappears again) when there is a load screen with a picture. So for example, if Chuck were to return to the safe house, which has a load screen with a picture, then return to the Casino, all of the money and items would have returned.Purchase the wheel and return to the safe house  After purchasing the wheel return to the safe house. On the way Chuck can pickup the gas canister which is just outside of Brockett Gas Station.Gasoline Canister  The Gasoline Canister is the easiest bike part to acquire. Chuck can acquire it as he is carrying the wheel back to the Brockett Gas Station safe house. It is in front of the Brockett Gas Station safe house, near a gas pump.Checking the Bike part screen  You can check the bike part screen to see Chuck's progress thus far.Engine  Sub-case name: Treasure in the Alley The engine is found in an alleyway adjacent to the Still Creek Movie Theater. Although the engine is found in an alley open to the street, the easiest way to explain how to reach this engine is through the theater. Travel through the concession stand. Travel through the movie theater itself. On the right side is a door. When Chuck opens the door he unlocks it, satisfying one portion of the Lockmith achievement. Turn to the right. Half way down the alley way is the engine. Pick it up and return to the Brockett Gas Station safe house. Remember that all items except for the gas canister must be carried with two hands, and Chuck drops the item if he attempts to switch to another item in his inventory.Bike Forks  The bike forks are acquired in a small shed on the south side of two between the Quarantine Zone and Big Buck Hardware, next to the ugly tire monument. But first, the key must be taken from the second floor of Still Creek Hotel.Travel to the Still Creek Hotel  The shed key is found in the Still Creek Hotel.

If Chuck does not have enough money to purchase the $5,000 wheel yet, walk across the street to the Still Creek Casino. Outside the casino doors is $300 on the ground. Chuck can acquire around $10,200 every trip into Still Creek Casino, which is the fastest way to make money. Play the Barnyard Bonanza clusters 5 times each (each play costs $100) for 5 guaranteed wins (pays out $300; total net gain of $1000 per cluster). This does not work on the Trouble With Turkeys slot machines, and Chuck will lose your money if he plays them. After playing those slot machines, break the slot machines, cash registers, and ATMs. Keep in mind that all of the money inside and outside respawns (reappears again) when there is a load screen with a picture.

Originally developed as an exclusive title for the Xbox 360 video game console, a Wii console remake was released in February 2009 titled Dead Rising: Chop Till You Drop.Dead Rising was released on August 8, 2006 in North America and in Japan on September 28, 2006. The game was a commercial success. It has been introduced into the Xbox 360 \" Platinum Hits \" lineup, and a cell phone version has recently been released. A sequel, entitled  Dead Rising 2, was developed by Blue Castle Games alongside many of the previous developers of Dead Rising and released in September 2010. Dead Rising's story centers on Frank West, a photojournalist who, in September 2006, ends up trapped in a shopping mall in the fictional town of Willamette, Colorado, that is infested with zombies. Frank must defend himself from zombie attacks, rescue survivors, contend with crazed psychopaths, and stay alive while still attempting to uncover the truth behind the incident. The player controls Frank as he explores the Willamette Parkview Mall, using any available object as a weapon. The player can complete several main and optional missions to earn Prestige Points (PP) and gain special abilities. The game is designed as a sandbox game and features several endings, depending on the decisions the player makes along the way.Development  The game was mainly inspired by zombie films from the 1960s and 1970s, especially those of George A. Romero. Despite its similarities to Dawn of the Dead, Capcom has assured that the game is in no way related to it. On the cover it states that that the game is in no way related to or authorized by George A. Romero. Keiji Inafune wanted to show a more comical view of zombies rather than the serious view portrayed in the Resident Evil series. A playable demo was released on the Xbox Live Marketplace for download on the Xbox 360 on August 4, 2006. On March 30, 2007, a Dead Rising Original Soundtrack featuring music written by Hideki Okugawa and Marika Suzuki, was released in a 2,000-copy limited edition. It was packaged with a T-shirt that showcased Frank, Isabela, and an outline of the mall.Character design  Keiji Inafune, designer of Mega Man and Dead Rising, wanted the main character Frank West to be different from the usual Japanese main character. Instead of having a young and beautiful protagonist, he wanted an everyman that looked average rather than beautiful or ugly. Frank's default attire includes a brown jacket with a white button-up shirt, green khaki pants, and brown loafers. Frank's appearance can be altered throughout the game by visiting the various stores of the mall. These range from changing into business suits and dresses to donning different glasses and even children's masks. Many of Dead Rising's costumes are references to other Capcom games such as Frank's unlockable Arthur's boxers from Ghosts 'n Goblins, Mega Man X\u2013style armor, and a Servbot head.Gameplay  The main objective of the game is to remain alive inside the zombie-infested mall for at least three days, after which help will arrive via chartered helicopter. Time in the game passes twelve times faster than real-time (i.e. one day in-game is two hours in real time); therefore, the game automatically concludes after six hours of gameplay when time runs out. In addition to this primary objective, the player is free to choose whether or not to pursue any of the game's secondary objectives such as rescuing survivors or defeating psychopaths. As Frank West, the player attempts to uncover the truth behind the zombie epidemic by completing \"case files\" that reveal the central game plot as they are completed. Completing case files by accomplishing specific tasks or by being \"in the right place at the right time\" to reveal cutscenes. Dead Rising does not prevent players from ignoring all missions, since missions are not the sole focus of the game. Once players have passed a certain point at the beginning of the game, they have complete free rein and can do whatever they please\u2014save or kill other survivors; wander aimlessly through the mall, sampling food and trying on clothes; or simply kill zombies\u2014just so long as, by the end of the game, they have reached the helipad in order to be able to catch the exit helicopter. Several of the game's 50 Achievements even reward this method of play. The setting of Dead Rising, the fictional Willamette Parkview Mall, is modeled after a stereotypical American mall with multiple floors and several themed sections. The mall includes a roller coaster, supermarket, movie theater, park, and an underground maintenance tunnel system (all filled with zombies). There are six main sections to the mall, each with a variety of shops, each filled with objects which can be used as weapons or to improve Frank's health. Electronic Gaming Monthly reported that there can be up to 800 zombies on the screen at once. During the day the zombies are sluggish and weak, but at night they become more active, gain a significant increase in toughness, sport glowing red eyes and increase in numbers. This was also used in the Mall stage of Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Ultimate All-Stars the zombies in the back get glowing red eyes when the stage gets dark. however if the players performs well, you will notice the zombies start to taking pictures of the fight.Encounters with surviving human characters  Scoops serve as optional side quests for the game. They are different from Cases, which are the main storyline quests, and are linear (meaning that if the player fails to complete a certain Case in time, they will be unable to complete all subsequent cases). Scoops are non-linear, though most to all are timed, and completely optional. They are assigned to the player by answering transceiver calls from Otis the Janitor, who is watching the mall via security cameras. Scoops will usually direct the player to a location in the mall to investigate another survivor of the zombie attack. These people are either Innocent Victims, whom Frank can escort to the security room for points, or Psychopaths, who are insane and must be killed. Eventually, all survivors, innocent and psychotic, will disappear from the game, presumably because they were overpowered by zombies (this does not include people that the player has saved, or characters essential to the storyline).Survivors  There are 49 survivors that can be located throughout the mall. There is no penalty for ignoring their pleas for help, or killing them. Saving them earns the player prestige points, and if they are killed, either by the player, zombies, or a psychopath, a picture of their corpse may be taken for additional points.Psychopaths  Most of the psychopaths are either hiding out in the mall after committing some villainous deed, or were driven insane by the horrors of the zombie outbreak. They include: Some are found by chance, others by Otis notifying Frank of some type of disturbance. After a certain part in the game, escaped convicts in a military jeep patrol the park, making passage through it more dangerous. Out of all of the psychopaths only one (or two if you spare him) will show remorse for what they did.Experience system  Dead Rising incorporates an experience system that allows Frank to improve his offensive and defensive capabilities as the game progresses. By taking photographs of different situations in gameplay the player can earn \"Prestige Points\", a form of experience points that allows the player to increase Frank's combat abilities. Those include upgrades to attack power, running speed, throw distance, health, and how many items Frank can carry at one time in his inventory. New moves are also unlocked but they only boost Franks effectiveness with hand to hand combat. Frank only earns one upgrade to one of these six categories per level. Photos are automatically evaluated and assigned a genre: either, horror, outtakes, erotica, or drama (although some photos are assigned no genre). The main source these experience points are gained is by helping survivors, killing zombies, or other minor actions within the game, such as riding the mall's roller coaster. Certain milestones may also be rewarded, such as \"1000 zombies killed\" or \"Perfect Photo\". Many attacks that Frank can learn are based on those used in professional wrestling. Should the player start a new game, all experience progression the player has already made can be carried over to the new game. In that way, the player may choose to ignore the plot completely and gain more Prestige Points to level up and use in a later game.Weapons  Dead Rising is notable for the hundreds of weapons that the player can find in the mall and use against the zombies. There are over 250 items that can be used as weapons, ranging from powerful to near-useless. Weapons will break down or run out of ammunition with use and be discarded, though certain weapons can be reused after breaking down. For example, a push broom can break in two, leaving the wooden staff to be used as a spear, or mannequins break into their component parts (arms, legs, and torso). Others can be changed by the environment, such as the frying pan, which can be heated on a stove to both increase damage and gain access to a special move. The player can also lift larger items like benches or cash registers that can be used to smash foes or be thrown at them. These items are not considered part of the player's inventory, as the player cannot store the item and it will be dropped if the player selects a different weapon from his/her inventory. Many of the more useless weapons in the game exist purely for humorous effect, such as a Toy Mega buster, from Capcom's Megaman X, that shoots tennis balls, or a glowing plastic Light Sword that the player can acquire in the mall's toy store in paradise plaza. Upon completing certain hidden objectives, lethal versions of these weapons become available for the player's use. Other comical weapons such as traffic cones and servbot novelty masks can be placed on zombie's heads and watch as they stumble, move about blinded. While such items are on their heads, the zombies are also unable to attack the player. Some strategic elements are present in the game. Certain books from the mall's bookstores will increase the durability of a weapon or the effectiveness of a health item in the player's inventory. Certain foods can be cooked by various appliances found in the mall to increase their effectiveness, and players may also combine two food or food-related items in blenders found throughout the mall to produce one of seven different \"Juices\", which provide temporary effects like invulnerability and boosts in speed. The best weapons to use are guns, katanas, long swords, sledgehammers, cleavers, knives, and outdoor weapons like hedge cutters and chainsaws. Foods that heal fairly well would be orange juice, wine, meat (uncooked and cooked), coffee creamer, mixed drinks, milk, and yogurt.Game modes and save system  Dead Rising features three modes of play: Dead Rising has an unusual save system: only one game-in-progress can be saved per memory device per Xbox 360 profile. Whenever the player is killed Dead Rising allows players to either load from their last save or to save their current level and abilities, then restart the game with their level and abilities applied from the beginning. (This option is offered due to one of the factors that when the player is in the early stages of leveling Frank, some of the challenges and bosses may be proven too difficult to complete till a higher level is reached, the difficulty of this depends on the player's own skill level.) This system is a deliberate game mechanic, borrowed from the Capcom RPG Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter; the two games share some development team members. The save system was implemented to give players a sense of responsibility for their actions when making various decisions throughout the game.Plot Introduction  The game focuses on the exploits of Frank West, a photojournalist investigating why the fictional town of Willamette, Colorado has been sealed off by the Colorado Army National Guard. Frank is dropped on top of the city's mall by helicopter; he tells the pilot, Ed DeLuca, to return in 72 hours. Upon entering the mall, Frank finds a group of survivors barricading the front entrance to the mall. The zombies are eventually let in by a panicked old woman named Lindsay Harris looking for her dog, a toy poodle named Madonna. A United States Department of Homeland Security officer named Brad urges everyone to retreat to the security room. Frank is the only one to reach the room with Brad and upon entering, the janitor, Otis Washington, welds the door shut. If the player fails to make it to the stairs Frank falls unconscious and is rescued by Otis and brought to the security room. Part of the same cut scene plays upon exiting the room. Brad then leaves the security room via the air ducts. Jessie, also of Homeland Security, recognizes an old man she identifies as Dr. Barnaby in one of Frank's photos, but neither Brad nor Jessie are willing to share what they know. After receiving a transceiver and map from Otis in order to be kept informed of the mall's events, Frank returns to the mall through the air ducts. He encounters survivors who need his assistance to the security room, as well as other people driven to madness by the zombie infestation, known as Psychopaths. As the story unfolds, Frank runs into Jessie who suffered from a sprained ankle when she falls backwards trying to avoid Frank almost hitting her with a fire extinguisher after he mistakes Jessie as a zombie sneaking up from behind. She then tells Frank she was on her way to help Brad who is being gunned down by a mysterious man named Carlito. To make up for his accident he asks Jessie for her gun and proposes to go in her place to help Brad, she eventually agrees. Upon defeating him Carlito retreats through the air vents. Brad then thanks Frank for assisting him, Frank then asked him what he knows about the whole incident but Brad refused to tell him anything, but upon Frank bribing Brad with the picture of Dr. Barnaby, Brad then reveals that he and Jessie are United States Department of Homeland Security agents and that they were looking for Dr. Barnaby. Frank then reveals that he took the photo at the Entrance Plaza. Brad and Frank then travel back to the Entrance Plaza to find Barnaby who locked himself inside a store and tells Brad he will not leave until he guarantees safe passage out of the mall. They then go back to the security room where later on the monitors they see Carlito tying Dr. Barnaby above a crowd of zombies. Upon his defeat Carlito then turns and shoots Brad hitting him in the leg but Brad shoots back hitting Carlito in the chest, Carlito then escaped by jumping off the 2nd floor balcony, Frank then rescues Barnaby and they return to the security room. Later in the security room Jessie questions Dr. Barnaby while Frank goes out to get medicine for Brad's gunshot wound. At the pharmacy he runs into a psychotic store manager named Steven who is holding a girl hostage in his modified shopping cart. (The girl who Frank encountered earlier at the Entrance Plaza) Upon defeating the psychopath the woman runs away before Frank could talk to her. He returns to the security room with the medicine and starts watching the security monitors. When seeing the woman again he goes after her, but upon finding her she hops on her motorcycle and begins to attack Frank. Upon defeating her she explains that the man shooting at them was her brother and tells Frank that she would bring Carlito with her once his wounds have healed and the three would meet in an unfinished store in the Northern Plaza at midnight. Upon waiting at the rendezvous point Isabela comes bursting inside being attacked by zombies, after killing the zombie that had Isabela pinned she tells Frank that Carlito refused to come and shot Isabela in the shoulder. Frank then carries her back to the security room, where she fell unconscious from her gunshot wound. Upon awakening, Isabela reveals that Barnaby was the head of an American research laboratory in the fictional Central American city of Santa Cabeza, the hometown of Carlito and Isabela. When Frank questions him, he confesses that the research facility was attempting to find methods of mass-producing cattle, but instead, Barnaby and his team genetically engineered a wasplike insect that would turn living organisms into zombies by stinging to inject a number of eggs, which quickly hatch into parasitic larvae, into the victim's bloodstream; \"zombification\" occurs when one such larva fully develops within the brainstem, killing the host and taking control of its body. After one of the Queen insects escaped and infected the town of Santa Cabeza, the US government sent a special forces team in to wipe out the entire city. The massacre was covered up under the pretenses that it was a raid on drug trade operations. Enraged over the slaughter of his people and home, Carlito released these insects in Willamette to obtain revenge and blackmailed Dr. Barnaby into coming to the mall. After Barnaby reveals the true nature of the infection he becomes a zombie himself and attacks Jessie, but is shot in the head by Brad before he can harm Frank. The zombie outbreak in Willamette is only the tip of the iceberg; as Isabela later explains, Carlito has much bigger plans. Hidden beneath the mall are five bombs that when detonated will propel immature queen larvae into the stratosphere, making a worldwide zombie pandemic a possibility. While Frank is trying to grab the bombs he is attacked by Carlito. Upon Carlito's defeat another cut scene plays where his van crashes and Carlito flees from the scene with Brad in hot pursuit. Frank then rounds up the remaining bombs, puts them in a shopping cart and runs them out of the maintenance tunnels. Meanwhile Brad and Carlito have their last showdown in a room located next door to the maintenance tunnels, which ends with Carlito getting shot in the chest again by Brad and Carlito knifing Brad in the shoulder. While stunned Brad is knocked outside into the maintenance tunnels and is faced with a large zombie Horde approaching him. Upon completing the mission if the player returns to the maintenance tunnels and goes to a certain area, a secret cut scene will play, Frank talks to Brad one last time who became infected by bites to his stomach by the zombies, Brad becomes zombified after the cut scene finishes. Frank and the remaining survivors turn their attention towards escaping to safety. Isabela reveals that Carlito has a hideout in the mall containing a laptop full of information, as well as a jamming device preventing Jessie from calling for outside help. Frank then escorts Isabela back to the Northern Plaza where Carlito's hideout is located, where she begins to try and crack the password to Carlito's laptop. Frank then receives a call from Jessie on his transceiver to return to the security room so she can show him something. Upon making his way back, Jessie shows recorded footage of Carlito being dragged into the meat processing plant by an unknown person. Upon arriving to the meat processing plant Frank finds Carlito being hung on a meat hook by Larry, the mall's butcher that gone insane. Mistaking Frank as a potential customer he prepares to turn Carlito into ground meat for Frank, Frank then tries to persuade Larry, saying he had other ideas in mind and just wanted Carlito, which failed and Frank had to fight and kill Larry. Upon getting Carlito down from the meat hook, Frank tried to get Carlito to tell him the password. Carlito never told Frank the password but he did say that his plan was not over and he gave Frank his locket and told him to give it to Isabela, Carlito died shortly after from his wounds. Upon making it back to Carlito's hideout, Isabela was still unable to crack the password. Frank then breaks the news to Isabela of her brother's passing, and upon Carlito's request gives her his locket. The locket then helped her think of the correct password, which was Pachamama. (Which you heard Carlito say a few times throughout the game.) She then gains access to the computer and shuts down the jamming array. Jessie places a call for help, only to be told that another cleanup mission has been authorized instead; special forces soldiers arrive in the mall shortly thereafter. Shortly after, two special forces officers arrive to the security room before the operation began and one of them offers to spare Jessie's life if she signs a written agreement to keep quiet about the zombie outbreak, at that moment Jessie is now zombified from Dr. Barnaby's earlier bite and attacks the officer. The second officer walks in after hearing noises to find zombie Jessie consuming the corpse of the other officer. Frank makes his way back to the security room, to find it is empty except for the now two dead officers and zombie Jessie wandering around the security room. A note reveals that Otis has commandeered a helicopter and flown himself and the remaining survivors to safety. After avoiding capture by the special forces soldiers, Frank makes his way back to Carlito's hideout and remained there till the special forces did their job and wiped out the mall of zombies. By 10:00 AM, two hours before the helicopters arrival, the mall is wiped clean of all zombies and a cut scene plays showing the Special Forces making their grand exit, Frank then asks Isabela to come with him to the helipad; she tells Frank to forget about her and save himself. Frank then makes his way through the now completely empty mall and made his way back to the helipad to meet Ed. The helicopter arrives on time, but as Ed prepares to land a stowaway zombie aboard the helicopter attacks him, causing Ed to lose control of the helicopter and crash into the clock tower in Leisure Park at the center of the mall. The game seemingly ends as Frank slumps to his knees in defeat, doing nothing to avoid the small group of zombies approaching him.Overtime mode  Still on the helipad, Frank is saved by Isabela, who shoots a zombie just as it is about to bite him. Frank passes out; he comes to in Carlito's hideout, where Isabela tells him that he may be infected, giving Frank just 24 hours before he becomes a zombie. However, Isabela believes she may be able to manufacture a cure from various items found in the mall, prompting Frank to scavenge for them. With the items Frank finds Isabela is unable to manufacture a cure, but instead comes up with a symptomatic treatment which will temporarily prevent Frank from becoming a zombie. While accessing Carlito's laptop they discover documents pointing to a theory that he has placed 50 similarly treated, larvae-infected children with foster parents across the country, which Frank calls \"The Ticking Time Bomb\" plan. Once all the items have been collected Isabela sends Frank to the Clock Tower in Leisure Park to retrieve another generator, when Frank reaches the tower he discovered a hole in the Clock tower made by the helicopter crash that revealed a tunnel. The tunnel is packed with zombies, but with some of the items leftover, Isabela is able to create a pheromone which repels them. Frank overpowers two Special Forces soldiers guarding the end of the tunnel and commandeers their vehicle to escape. They are intercepted by a tank which overturns their vehicle, but Frank disables the tank in process. The special forces leader, Brock, emerges from the tank and points its cannon at Frank and he then reveals that he was behind the original cleanup operation in Santa Cabeza. The tanks cannon then stops focusing on Frank and turns toward an incoming Horde of zombies, while Brock was distracted Frank jumps atop the tank, engages Brock in hand-to-hand combat and eventually knocks him into a mob of zombies on the ground below. With Isabela still trapped on top of the overturned vehicle, Frank turns and screams into the sky. The epilogue states that Frank managed to escape Willamette and reported on the incident, forcing the government to admit partial responsibility for the livestock research program. Isabela's fate is unclear, but she could have possibly survived due to the fact that a drug named Zombex is later created which only Isabela knew how to make at the time. Zombex is a drug Chuck Greene, the main character in Dead Rising 2 quests for and tries to obtain. The information about Carlito's Ticking Time Bomb plan was never proven.(By the game Dead Rising 2 released August 31, 2010, could prove this plan to be real and that it caused the infection to spread across the United States.) The game ends on the quote: \"And yet he complained that his belly was not full.\" (This is a slight misquotation from the English nursery rhyme Robin the Bobbin, a poem about a glutton who eats people.)Characters Survivors  The citizens of Willamette who were not initially killed or rendered undead by the zombie outbreak are referred to as \"survivors.\" Many survivors can be escorted safely to the security room, and will often provide Frank with competent cover if given firearms or other weapons; others may be injured, cowardly, traumatized, hostages, or even drunk, requiring Frank to lead them directly to the exit point and possibly rendering him unable to use his weapons. Otis will periodically update Frank with information on certain survivors and their locations, though some survivors must be found without assistance. Certain missions or \"unannounced\" survivors are time-sensitive: if Frank takes too long to begin a scoop their health will decrease, and in some cases of large rescues from certain psychopaths they may die off one by one. The player may also choose to leave the survivors to die, or kill them himself. Successful rescues will earn PP for Frank, with the rescue of certain survivors new missions which are either mutiny or personal requests asked by the survivors. Mutiny missions takes place when a previously rescued survivor begins trying to persuade the other survivors that are in the same room to come with them and leave the security room to reach a goal or destination, if Frank fails to avert the mutiny, all survivors that were in that room in the security area will leave the security room and most likely to face a grim fate. If Frank averts the mutiny, the survivors are spared and Frank is awarded some PP points. What actions you must do to avert a mutiny varies from survivor to survivor. The second type of mission is \"personal request\" missions. A previously rescued survivor may ask Frank for a favor that can vary from bringing them certain items such as weapons or performing certain actions, the player is not penalized if they choose to ignore doing personal request missions but completing them does give PP points.Psychopaths  In addition to battling thousands of zombies, Frank West must also deal with psychopaths: humans who have either gone mad due to the zombie outbreak or are otherwise corrupt or evil, and who serve as the game's bosses. In addition to granting access to certain areas, routes, or further advancing the plot, many psychopaths leave behind unique weapons which remain available at their specific location throughout the rest of the game. About half of the psychopaths the player can fight are optional encounters and can be avoided with no penalty. However, there are also some that must be encountered and defeated in order for the games story plot to progress.Soundtrack  Dead Rising Original Soundtrack was released in Japan on March 30, 2007 as a limited edition, bundled with a T-shirt. A non-limited edition of the same soundtrack was released on June 20, 2007Reception  Dead Rising has earned generally positive reviews. All the reviewers commended the game's \"sandbox\" style mall to explore and the sheer amount of ways to kill the thousands of zombies. Most reviewers also agreed the save system, as well as the survivors' AI detracted from the game's enjoyment. IGN stated the game needed \"a better save system, more intelligent NPCs, a more forgiving story progression, and tighter controls,\" but still called Dead Rising \"one of the more unique and entertaining titles on the Xbox 360.\"GameSpot said, \"It's zombie action for people who want zombie action, and it's simply a great piece of entertainment.\" A point of contention was the operation of the game's transceiver, specifically how persistent it is when ringing, and how vulnerable Frank is while answering any calls on it. While using the transceiver Frank is unable to jump, attack, switch weapons, or pick up or use any item. Furthermore, if the call is somehow interrupted (such as being attacked), the call will end abruptly, only for the transceiver to ring a few seconds later. If Frank answers, Otis will scold the player for being rude, then start the previous call over from the very beginning. Numerous gamer-oriented webcomics and blogs attacked the use of the transceiver within Dead Rising. The Australian video game talk show Good Game's two reviewers gave the game a 6/10 and 7/10. Dead Rising has won several awards. IGN awarded the title \"Most Innovative Design for Xbox 360\" in its Best of 2006. GameSpot's Best and Worst of 2006 awarded the game honors for \"Best Action Adventure Game\", \"Best Sound Effects\", and \"Best Use of Xbox 360 Achievement Points\". Additionally, the game won \"Action Game of the Year\" at the 2006 Spike TV Video Game Awards. It ranked #2 in gaming magazine Gamesmaster's Top 50 of 2006. It also won \"Best Original Game\" of 2006 on X-Play. According to Capcom, Dead Rising had shipped 500,000 copies in the first month after its release, and one million copies worldwide by the end of 2006.Reaction in Germany  Due to its graphic violence and thus obvious fulfilment of at least one of German BPjM's indexing criteria, the Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle, Germany's board responsible for rating entertainment software, has refused to rate the game. Microsoft does not allow unrated games to be published for the Xbox 360 in Germany, effectively halting the production of a German version of the game. Right from the start, the game has been indexed by the BPjM as a document that glorifies violence, but has been available as an import to players of legal age. Following a decision of Hamburg's county court in June 2007, the game has been prohibited in late August 2007. Therefore, selling this game in Germany is a criminal offense punishable by imprisonment or monetary penalty according to \u00a7131 of the German criminal code. It was confiscated by the police from all stores in Germany. Owning and playing the game is still legal for private use.Legal issues  The MKR Group, who holds the copyright to both the 1978 Dawn of the Dead film and its 2004 remake, sent letters on February 6, 2008 to Capcom, Microsoft, and Best Buy, claiming that Dead Rising infringes on the copyrights and trademarks of these films. In a complaint filed February 12, 2008 to seek an injunction that would pre-emptively counter an anticipated complaint from MKR, Capcom asserted that \"humans battling zombies in a shopping mall\" is a \"wholly unprotectible idea\" under today's copyright laws; Capcom further pointed to the warning \"label\" on the box cover as a preemptive measure that was intended to separate the game from the films and avoid any customer confusion. The MKR Group subsequently filed a lawsuit in February 2008 after failing to reach an agreement with Capcom over the dispute. The lawsuit was dismissed in October 2008, with United States Magistrate Judge Richard G. Seeborg stating that MKR failed to demonstrate the similarity of any protected element of Dawn of the Dead to that of Dead Rising, with many of the elements MKR claimed were similar being part of the \"wholly unprotectable concept of humans battling zombies in a mall during a zombie outbreak\".Text-size issues  Dead Rising has drawn complaints from gamers that have standard definition sets and smaller high definition sets for having difficulty reading the on-screen text. This is due to Capcom's decision to develop exclusively for high-definition televisions, as the game had been touted as one of the first truly \"next generation\" titles available for the Xbox 360. On August 10, 2006, a Capcom representative posted the following on Xbox.com: A week later, Capcom released a statement saying they would not be fixing the problem and suggested some DIY solutions: Using a computer monitor is also a solution to the problem, as the Xbox 360 supports a number of common monitor resolutions high enough to render the text readable. While the small text within Dead Rising cannot be fixed, Capcom responded quickly to avoid similar criticism on the same issue for their next major Xbox 360 game, Lost Planet: Extreme Condition. When the demo was released in late 2006, it also had significant amounts of small text, and responding to these complaints, Capcom adjusted the game prior to release to detect the use of a standard TV and increased the font size as needed.Limited Edition  A Limited Edition was available on release within the UK which featured steel case packaging and a store guide map of Willamette Shopping Mall.Future development Downloadable content  Many costumes are made available to the player once completing certain tasks, such as a Special Forces uniform, wrestling boots, even Jason Voorhees' hockey mask and Mega Man's armor. Soon after Dead Rising was released in the United States, Capcom released nine downloadable \"keys\" to Xbox Live Marketplace that would unlock different lockers in the Security Room, providing the player with nine new outfit options. On May 31, 2007, three more keys were made available over Xbox Live.Dead Rising: Chop Till You Drop  A port of Dead Rising for the Wii, named Dead Rising: Chop Till You Drop, was released in February 2009. This version of the game came about after the positive reception of the Wii version of Resident Evil 4. The game is built on the RE 4 Wii engine, and includes additional features from that game including an over-the-shoulder camera approach and motion controls utilizing the Wii Remote. However it lacks some of the features of the Xbox 360 version, such as the large number of zombies on screen at any time or the photo system.Mobile phone version  In 2008, Capcom released a version of the game for mobile phones. The game stays true to the sandbox design and plot of the Xbox 360 version, despite being pared down for the smaller screen and platform. The mobile version of Dead Rising was generally well received by reviewers, earning a B+ from 1UP.com and a 7.3/10 from IGN.Sequel  A sequel to Dead Rising for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Personal computer, is currently under development by Blue Castle Games, confirming earlier rumors and a viral video of the game's existence. The game is stated to take place several years after the events of Dead Rising with the outbreak taking over much of America. The game will be set in a former gambling paradise known as \"Fortune City\". The trailer which was released was first leaked and then later released officially.Other appearances  Frank West appeared as a playable character in the fighting game Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Ultimate All-Stars. His main special moves revolve around using zombies and the various makeshift weapons from the game, whilst his hyper combos involve wearing the Mega Man X costume and using a Servbot helmet on his opponent. Also, Frank West is a playable character in Capcom's Lost Planet: Colonies. He is able to be selected as a character in the online multiplayer after achieving level 100. He appears in the game with only his blue boxer shorts. He seems to appear in the sequel of Lost Planet, along with Albert Wesker from Capcom's Resident Evil series and two characters from Gears of War. In Valve Corporation's add-on content, \"The Passing\", in Left 4 Dead 2, a message from Frank directed to Otis appears among other messages left by anonymous others on the wall of a safehouse.This could mean Deadrising is related to Left 4 Dead but seems unlikely due to the other cameos. It is rumored that West will appear in the upcoming release Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds due to the fact that there is a silhouette strongly resembling him. However, no official word from Capcom has been released if he is in the game or not. Capcom has stated in a recent interview with Destructoid they wish to put Frank West in as many Capcom games as possible. Frank West has been placed 3rd in ScrewAttack's Top 20 list for the \"Manliest Men in Video Games\"External links Walkthroughs Forums  Bold textCombo Weapons (Dead Rising 2)  Combo Weapons are weapons that are made from a combination of two weapons created in Maintenance Rooms\u00a0in\u00a0Fortune City, Still Creek\u00a0and\u00a0the Phenotrans Facility. Chuck Greene can discover how to make combo weapons through the use of special construction recipes called Combo Cards which will tell\u00a0the player how to make certain combo weapons. These cards can be obtained by examining various fixtures around Fortune City, rescuing survivors, defeating psychopaths and by purchasing with money. Some combo weapons can be purchased from pawnshops and from other survivors. Combo weapons can also be created by trial and error. When a combo weapon is created without first identifying a combo card, a scratch card is obtained instead. This will record how the weapon is made. However, a combo weapon created without a combo card cannot perform its heavy attack and gains less PP from killing zombies. In Dead Rising 2: Case West and Dead Rising 2: Off the Record, Frank West returns to the action and he also gains the ability to make combo weapons. Frank even gains a few of his own unique combo cards which only he can master to full effect.Dead Rising 2 Case Zero  Case Zero includes the Spiked Bat, Air Horn, Molotov, Electric Rake, Boomstick, Beer Hat, Paddlesaw, I.E.D.,\u00a0and Drill Bucket. There are no unique combo weapons that are special to Case Zero.Case West Off the Record Combo Bikes  Combo Bikes are combo weapons that are made by combining a Dirtbike with another weapon. These bikes can't be created unless Chuck completes the mission \"Meet the Contestants\" and unlocks the trailer that can be used to create the combo bikes.\u00a0The combo bikes don't require Combo Cards for their points. Combo Bikes can only be made in Dead Rising 2.Notes Trivia Gallery  Cite error:  tags exist, but no  tag was foundDead Rising 2 Combo Weapons Dead Rising 2: Off the Record Dead Rising 2 Weapons  Below is a list of weapons found in Dead Rising 2.Psychopaths  ? The psychopaths in the Dead Rising series are humans who have either gone criminally insane due to the sheer stress and chaos of the zombie outbreak and/or seeing friends, family, and others being slaughtered by the undead, or are otherwise evil and see the outbreak as an opportunity to do whatever they wish. They serve as the game's \"bosses\", but players only come by most of them if they go to certain areas. Defeating them usually has a beneficial side-effect such as access to new areas, rescuing certain survivors, and/or unique weapon drops. Incidentally, not all of the \"psychopaths\" are genuinely insane; some are either corrupt, morally deprived individuals using the outbreak as a chance to engage in criminal activities (such as looting and violence against survivors) or at the least, are extremely paranoid of others. For example, the Convicts are a trio of criminals who escaped prison, commandeered a military Humvee and are simply taking advantage of the outbreak by causing chaos without having to worry about the police. At times, the game considers normal people to be psychopaths until defeated for the storyline. Isabela Keyes, for example, is entirely sane, but must be defeated by Frank in combat to get her to listen to him. Afterwards, she becomes an ally and plays a major role in the story. Diego Martinez went into shock after discovering the zombie that was believed to have started an outbreak in the town of Smithville had a number 4 tattooed onto his neck, just like himself. Others, like Kent Swanson and Kenny Dermot, appear to be friendly at first, but later become hostile. Some psychopaths, such Kenny or Paul Carson, can be saved as a survivor after defeating them after they see the fault in their ways. In Dead Rising 4, the psychopaths are replaced by the maniacs, although with the same purpose.Dead Rising Psychopaths Dead Rising: Chop Till You Drop Psychopaths Dead Rising 2: Case Zero Psychopaths Dead Rising 2 Psychopaths Dead Rising 2: Case West Psychopaths Dead Rising 2: Off the Record Psychopaths Dead Rising 3 Psychopaths Dead Rising 4 Maniacs  In Dead Rising 4, the term \"psychopath\" has been replaced with \"maniac.\" There are significantly fewer maniacs than the previous installments.Psychopath Groups Machines Others Notes Combo Cards  There are two cards available for each combination-weapon available in Dead Rising 2: an inferior Scratch Card\u00a0and a superior Combo Card. Both cards indicate the two weapons required to build the combo weapon. Possessing the Combo Card grants the player a PP bonus when using that weapon and also allows the player to employ that weapon's secondary attack. Unlike Scratch Cards, which are only obtained by combining eligapons into a Combo Weapon (or buying items from a pawnshop), Combo Cards can be earned through a variety of ways, examples:List of Combo Cards Obtained in Case Zero  The following Combo Cards can be obtained in Dead Rising 2: Case Zero and will get carried over into Dead Rising 2:Case West combo cards  Three combo cards are exclusive to Chuck and three are exclusive to Frank. Whenever a character uses a certain weapon, that is not exclusive to him, no matter if he has the combo card or not, that character will not receive the full prestige point amount and that character will not be able to perform all weapon moves. For example, a player must play as Frank to perform the Reaper's alternate attack and gain full prestige point value per zombie kill with that weapon. Frank will gain 1,000 PP per zombie with the Sterilizer while Chuck only gets 500 prestige point per kill also.Trivia References Dead Rising 2 Characters  Characters from Dead Rising 2.Characters  This category lists all the character subcategories in the Dead Rising series. Also in this category are the characters for Zombrex: Dead Rising Sun and Tape it or Die. Click a link for pages that fall into that category. For an easy list of characters, seeGames  The following are games in the Dead Rising series:Snowflake Dead Rising 2 Survivors  In Dead Rising 2, there are over a hundred survivors that can be found throughout Fortune City. However, not all manage to survive the outbreak, as dozens die, even after the initial chaos. They can be escorted to the Safe House, although Chuck has the option to kill them, let them die, leave them, etc. without being penalized. Successfully escorting survivors or at least getting them to join Chuck's party will award him a hefty PP bonus. Some survivors also give Chuck rewards when successfully escorting them to safety, such as money, Zombrex, Combo Cards, etc.List of survivors  The following is a list of survivors in order of rescue followed by introduction.Types of Survivors  Survivors have much-improved AI which allow them to comply to movement and battle. Zombies will focus more on Chuck rather than the survivors, but will still attack them if Chuck doesn't attend to them, or if he is somewhere the zombies cannot get to. Some survivors have unique AIs and must be escorted under certain conditions. While escorting survivors, be careful that survivors are close to Chuck when he changes zones, otherwise the survivors will not come into the new area with Chuck. This can be frustrating, as it is somewhat time consuming to go back to recover them, and most of the time the doors to the exit are crowded with zombies who will attack while Chuck waits for them to catch up.Normal  These survivors are the most common, they can be equipped with almost any weapon in the game with the exception of combo weapons and heavy weapons, which if the player tries to equip them with, they will reply with an insult or a refusal. Survivors also comment on what Chuck equip them with. Giving them an unsuitable weapon will result in them complaining, and giving them an acceptable weapon will result in them thanking Chuck. Examples: Vikki Taylor, Denyce Calloway, Danni Bodine.Advanced Unarmed Combat  Very few survivors met around Fortune City can actually kill zombies very effectivley without the need of a weapon. These survivors can perform punches and kicks that can kill a zombie with one or two blows. When surrounded by a group a zombies the survivor with perform a punch while rotating in place knocking any zombies around them to the floor or dead. Examples: Cora Russel, Nina Suhr, Summer Chavez.Refuse Weapons  Few survivors use weapons (most commonly a metal briefcase) containing winnings they have won during their stay in Fortune City or stolen money before or during the outbreak. They will not let go of their item or accept food/healing items due to them already holding something and not giving it up. This means Chuck should be careful when escorting these survivors. Examples: Royce St. John, Walter Morris, Woodrow Rutherford.Carry an Item  Few survivors will request Chuck to carry an item for them. If Chuck drops the item, the survivor(s) may act erratically, running all over the place and ignoring orders. The only way to stop them is to pick up the item as soon as possible. When reaching the Safe House, the item Chuck was requested to hold will not be on him anymore. Examples: Bessie Kent, Erica Mayes, Rosa Collins.Unable to Walk  Some survivors are injured, drunk, too scared, etc. and will ask Chuck to carry them or hold them over his shoulder. They also will not accept a weapon but they will accept food. The Leadership magazine affects these survivors so they don't have to be carried and they will run like everyone else, but they still will not accept a weapon. Examples: Kristin Harris, Esther Alwin, Tammy Blaine.Fulfilling Requests  There are some survivors who will request something or want Chuck to do something for them before they will join Chuck. This can range from having to possess a certain item, requesting a drink, or having to pay them a certain sum of money. After these requests are completed, the survivors will join Chuck and can be escorted back to the Safe House. Examples: Janus Razo, Bill Montagu, Linette Watkins.Escorting Survivors  Survivor AI in Dead Rising 2 is much improved over its predecessor, and Chuck is not required to keep a constant eye on their progress. This is partly due to the fact that if Chuck is nearby, zombies will focus on him rather than survivors. Unlike the first game, they will follow Chuck's commands easily, and also follow him everywhere, rather than stopping for no reason and opening themselves to attack.Escorting Survivors tutorial  When a survivor first joins Chuck, a tutorial screen appears. v \u00b7 d \u00b7 eRecruiting Survivors  Upon finding a survivor, simply press the  /  button or E key near them to begin the dialogue sequence. In the process of a conversation, Chuck may have to reply multiple times to convince them to follow him. Some missions also require Chuck to carry out certain actions, such as having a certain weapon in his inventory, deliver food/drink, administer Zombrex, or have a particular survivor in his party. Once the survivor is convinced, they will join Chuck's party.Giving Commands  Tapping the  /  button will have Chuck shout out random commands to keep up to any survivors in his party. This command has the effect of causing the survivors to stop their current actions and head towards Chuck. Using this command will cause any existing waypoints to be deactivated. Tapping the  /  button while aiming with the R2 / RT will have Chuck direct any survivors in his party to a waypoint. Setting a new waypoint will cause the previous one to be deactivated.Under Attack  If a survivor is under attack, he or she will call out for help, while fending off the zombie. He or she will eventually be able to escape its grasp and continue following Chuck, but they may have lost some health.Health  The current health level of survivors is indicated on the green name bar. The proportion of the health bar that is green represents remaining health. When survivors have less than full health, Chuck can give them a food item to restore their health. Leaving an area which requires a loading screen without the survivor(s) close to Chuck will cause their health to slowly decrease until Chuck returns for them.Defection  Survivors will defect from Chuck's party if he harms them repeatedly. Survivors that are recruited in groups will defect together if one of their own defects. Also, certain rescued survivors will defect from the Safe House if Chuck allows a mutiny to proceed. Defected survivors will be hostile towards Chuck.Unnamed Victims  Many survivors survived the initial outbreak but were soon killed by the zombies. Here are some:Similarities Models  There are several survivors in Dead Rising 2: Case Zero and Dead Rising 2 that share the same character model with another character in the opposite game or within the game.Names  There are several survivors in both games that share name similarities in Dead Rising and Dead Rising 2. Some have a similar name in the other game, while some names are used more than once in one game.Trivia References External links Isabela Keyes Katey Greene Zombies (Dead Rising)  Zombies are people infected by mutated wasps or other zombies, either through stings or bites, appearing in all games in the Dead Rising series. Their only purpose is to find, infect, and devour humans. They were previously human beings who were infected with the parasitic larvae of an unknown experimental wasp. Zombies are rather fragile and easier to kill than uninfected humans. When bitten by a zombie it takes on average around 24 hours to become one, though it varies greatly from person to person, and can sometimes depend on where the person is bit (for example, a person bit in the neck will transform within seconds and this is shown in Dead Rising 2, while an arm bite may take longer). However, if a person is bitten by more than one zombie multiple times, then this may quicken the process. The only exceptions are perhaps Frank West and Chuck Greene, who both sustains many bites from zombies over the course of the game and never become a zombie, and Nick Ramos, who is immune to the infection. This is meant for gameplay purposes, but Isabela notes that Frank does have a high resistance to the infection. Gretchen Peregrine explained that a bite needs to be somewhat deep to infect a person.Physiology  A fully infected Zombie is significantly different from what it was as a human, the larvae fully develops and renders its host incurable. The physical appearance of zombies is drastically altered, their skin is rapidly drained of color, leaving all zombies with a pale bluish-grey hue. Their eyes also lose a significant amount of color, possibly as a result of dehydration. Large wounds are commonly found on zombies, although it is not known if they are an effect of the infection, accidental wounds brought on by lack of sensitivity to pain, or where the infected was initially bitten. Zombies display a complete lack of pain sensitivity, being able to function with gaping wounds and missing limbs, only succumbing when fatally wounded or from bleeding out. As a result of the infection, zombies are incredibly fragile, being susceptible to attacks that would barely affect a healthy human. Zombies are also incredibly slow, only increasing their movement speed mildly while hunting prey. They are also quite weak, and are unable to efficiently use weapons, though some use weapons they had experience with prior to infection, though in a very ineffective way. As a result of their brains functionally dying, Zombies lack any semblance of human intelligence, acting more akin to mosquitoes searching out new prey than a regular human. They have no sense of strategy, frequently killing themselves in pursuit of prey. Zombies lose the ability to speak, lacking the intelligence, and only retain the ability to mindlessly grunt, which does not appear to be communicative, to humans or fellow zombies.Types of Zombies  There are several types of zombies that are different than the normal ones.Dead Rising Dead Rising: Chop Till You Drop Zombie Models Dead Rising zombies  There are less than thirty different zombies in Dead Rising. It is not uncommon for Frank to be attacked by quadruplets (the same zombie generated four times together). Below is an attempt to photograph all of the zombies in Dead Rising, with unofficial nicknames.Dead Rising Zombie Qualities Aggressiveness  At night, zombies become more aggressive. This can easily be observed in any zombie due to its glowing red eyes during this time or by looking at zombies near a Queen that has its eyes red as well. Zombies can also take much more punishment at night. For example, a Level 50 Frank can jump kick a normal zombie, killing it in one hit. At night, however, it takes two kicks. Between 7pm to around 7am daily, zombies are aggressive with more endurance and red eyes. If Frank stays on one load screen, the zombies never lose their red eyes and evening aggression. Unlike Dead Rising, zombies in Chop Till You Drop are weaker at night.Endurance  Using a Rat Stick at level 1, one of the weakest weapons in the game, a player can determine precisely how strong zombies are in comparison to each other. Frank at level 50 kills the zombies much faster. For example, it takes 6 hits to kill a fat man with a rat stick at level 50, and 15 times at level 1. Nighttime is at 7:00 pm every day, when the zombies eyes become red, making them \"stronger, faster, and much more violent\"Zombies Killed Bonus  After completing the game, Frank can earn more Prestige Points depending on the number of zombies killed over the course of 72 hours in the mall: v \u00b7 d \u00b7 eSurvivor Lookalikes  Sometimes Frank may see a zombie that looks like a survivor but recolored and zombified. Zombies who look similar to survivors include:Survivor Death Scenes  If a survivor's health is fully depleted from attacks by zombies, one of death scenes is triggered showing him/her being killed by the zombies in a gruesome manner. If you go to where he/she dies, you can see that he/she has risen as a zombie and will behave accordingly. The notebook\u00a0will also list him/her as . This works for all survivors and psychopaths. If the survivor's health reaches zero for any reason other than being attacked by zombies, then he/she will simply lie there, not rise up, and be marked as  in the notebook.

There is a chance that a survivor's death scene from a zombie attack will include them carrying a pistol (even if they're not carrying one when they die) and committing suicide rather than being eaten, they then appear as dead instead of undead.

Includes stage appearances as well as in-text cameos.The King of Fighters XIII  The King of Fighters XIII is the thirteenth installment in The King of Fighters series and the final chapter of \"Tales of Ash\" Saga, started in The King of Fighters 2003. The theme for this title is \"KOF-ism\" or getting back to the heart of the series. The main objective of the game's new features is to appeal to the audience that prefers quick combos. Mobile versions of the game were released on July 7, 2011 and a downloadable application for social networks was released on October 17, 2011. Additionally, an iOS version of the game, titled The King of Fighters-i-, feauring a reduced character roster, was released on July 7, 2011; an update of this version that includes six more characters was released on September 8, 2011. This same version was later ported to the Android platform on March 22, 2012, as The King of Fighters Android. An updated version featuring 12 new characters and other modes was released on iOS-based devices on May 3, 2012, called The King of Fighters-i 2012. This same version was released on Android on September 3, 2013 as The King of Fighters-A 2012. A new version of the game, including the characters introduced on the console ports as well as new revisions, was released in Japanese arcades on April 26, 2012, under the name The King of Fighters XIII Climax.

Then other members of the group Heidern was tracking suddenly appeared and vanished, as if to mock Heidern and his team. Who are \"Those From the Distant Land,\" and why are they so persistent in their pursuit of the power of Orochi? Meanwhile, Ash Crimson, having obtained Kagura's power, chose to ignore Elisabeth's cautions and took on Iori Yagami's power. Yata was defeated, and Yasakani has fallen. Only one of the Three Sacred Treasures remains: the Sword of Kusanagi. However, Kyo Kusanagi suffered a major injury at the hands of Yagami, who had been overtaken by the power of the revitalized Orochi. Time has passed... With these recent incidents, it was feared that the next King of Fighters tournament would never happen. However, thanks to an unheard-of amount of promotion by a mysterious party, the KoF will be held on an unprecedented scale. The new mixed martial arts tournament is on the world stage, and the mass media has been giving it coverage like never before. Fighters all across the world begin to receive invitations... all sent from \"R\"!Gameplay Characters  The entire roster from The King of Fighters XII (including the two console exclusive characters) return in The King of Fighters XIII, arranged in the usual teams of three people. Both Mukai and Botan return. Rose Bernstein returns and is also the sponsor of this year's tournament. All the remaining members from Those from the Past group have their faces revealed and are being led by Saiki. When the game designer was asked about his personal thoughts for this new cast in an interview, he remarked that he isn't always looking forward to adding popular characters from other series. As before with KOF XII, the overall goal for the cast is to create contrasts and variations between each character for an interesting balance between teams. Whenever possible, he believes the characters in The King of Fighters should be reenacting a classic fist-to-fist battle rather than one that relies too much on additional weaponry. Lately, the desire to stay true to this theme in an interesting manner has decided who gets to appear in KOF.Elisabeth Team Japan Team Fatal Fury Team Art of Fighting Team Ikari Warriors Team Psycho Soldier Team Women Fighters Team Kim Team Yagami Team K' Team Mid-Boss Bosses Sub-Boss Final Boss Console/PC/Climax Exclusive Characters DLC/EX Characters Cosplay  Several alternate colors for the cast are homages to characters in other games or media.

He was first introduced in The King of Fighters '94 as the leader of the Japan team. He is the rival of Iori Yagami. He was first introduced as a cocky delinquent high school student who is the heir of the Kusanagi clan, one of the three clans that sealed the legendary snake entity, Orochi, 1,800 years ago. His clan wields pyrokinetic powers, an inherited power that few members obtain. They, along with the Yasakani and Yata clans, keep one of the three sacred treasures used to contain Orochi long ago. His family's treasure is the Kusanagi Sword (\u8349\u8599\u306e\u5263, Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi), and his family crest is the sun, represented in a stylized halo of fire. His official nickname is Scion of the Flame (\u708e \u306e \u8cb4\u516c\u5b50, Honoo no Kikoushi)  or The cleansing exorcising flame (\u706b\u708e \u7953 \u6fef, Kaen Harau Yusu). Aside from the main series, Kyo also has a spin-off manga story based on his adventure in The King of Fighters '96, entitled The King of Fighters: Kyo. A video game under the same name was also created to further expand his character. In addition, a number of image songs and audio dramas featuring Kyo's character have been released, including the contents of his own character image album consisting of all of his theme songs. He is a member of SNK's character image band, The Band of Fighters and also co-star alongside Iori in one of SNK's promotional series, Part Time Stories: Kyo & Iori. At Vigamus, a museum of videogames sponsored by the municipality of Rome, a special illustration lists Kyo as the mascot of the mid-90's era of Neo Geo.Development  When designing characters for the first The King of Fighters, developers wanted a new hip hero who would easily rival the Fatal Fury and Art of Fighting characters in style. Through most of his development, Kyo was meant to be called Syo Kirishima, and was dressed in martial arts clothing common with fighting games at the time. But late in production, his name became Kyo Kusanagi, likely due to the KOF story's change in direction towards the Yamata no Orochi legend. When designing Syo, Shinichi Morioka (Kyo and Iori's creator) used Shotaro Kaneda from the Akira manga as inspiration. When Syo appears as a striker in KOF 2000, he would be voiced by Mitsuo Iwata who also voiced Kaneda.  The idea for his flames -as well as the other elemental powers for the rest of the Japan team- was derived from the anime Getter Robo; in the show, there were three featured heroes who served as the inspiration for the KOF trio: the protagonist had a \"fiery\" persona, his friend was \"edgy and daring\", and the third hero was the \"down-to-earth giant\". It is also a homage to a Japanese phrase of giving birth to fire (roughly translated as \"lighting strikes the earth which sparks the flame\"). Other influences include Jo Yabuki and Akira Fudo from the respectively series Ashita no Joe and Devilman. His change in fighting style was also made as a part of the series's overhaul in The King of Fighters '96. To appease all fans, they also included an older version of Kyo from The King of Fighters '94 into The King of Fighters '97 and placed the '95 version of Kyo in '98, which made both versions of Kyo popular during location tests. The idea of having two versions of Kyo at once lead to the concept of his clones; during the early development stages of The King of Fighters '99, SNK planned to avoid adding any version of Kyo altogether, or Iori, to the game, as the story's focus was meant to center on the new protagonist, K'. However, they retracted this decision, as \"they couldn't leave these popular characters in limbo\". Since then, veteran developers for the series admit that Kyo's repeated appearances in the series is due to the marketers and the main planners' insistence to add him, Iori, and other SNK regulars in every game, making it a challenge to decide the story for each title. Kyo's voice actor, Masahiro Nonaka, related greatly with his character as being young and reckless until he \"grew up\" in his later appearances. He then expressed some difficulty accepting Kyo on the same level. According to Nobuyuki Kuroki, the staff wanted to provide a new design that would captivate new fans.  Despite Kyo being the main character, they decided to drastically change his hair and outfit. Despite fearing fans would not like Kyo's new appearance, the staff commented they aimed it as a challenge, commenting old players from the series would understand he is still the same character despite cosmetic changes. This new design, alongside Iori's, provoked major controversy during the time it was revealed. However in an interview, The King of Fighters XIV director Yasuyuki Oda said the team wanted the characters to carry a new look due to the game being set in a new story arc. Kyo, along with his rival, Iori, has been noted by several of the series's designers as being one of the most difficult characters to illustrate because of his popularity amongst fans. In Gamest's 1997 Heroes Collection, Kyo was voted as the staff's second favorite character. In the Neo Geo Freak's 1997 Volume 8 character poll, he was voted as the favourite character overall, with a total of 2,160 votes.  620 votes from the male fans and 1,540 votes from the female fans. In a 2005 poll made by SNK-Playmore USA, he was voted as the sixth fan favorite character with a total of 176 votes. In the character popularity poll on Neo Geo Freak's website, he was voted as the third favorite character with a total of 2,574 votes. In an interview with one of the manhua artist and authors, Wing Yan, he replies that Kyo is his favorite original character in the series. Garou: Mark of the Wolves planner and The King of Fighters XIV producer Yasuyuki Oda states that Kyo and Leona are his favourite characters in The King of Fighters series.Story Clan Background  660 years ago, the Kusanagi and Yasakani clans were once allies. However, due to a horrible misunderstanding, the Yasakani struck a blood pact with Orochi for more power. They renamed their family name to Yagami, and their flames, previously red like their former allies, changed to violet from Orochi's taint. Since then, the clans have waged a generation long grudge with casualties made from both sides. It continues in The King of Fighters series with Kyo and Iori Yagami.Orochi Saga  The Orochi saga takes place between The King of Fighters '94 and '97. Kyo surpassed his father at the age of fifteen and was designated as the clan's leader. Shortly after the completion of his training, Kyo competes in a preliminary held in Japan to determine the members of the country's representative team in the King of Fighters tournament. He bests Goro Daimon and Benimaru Nikaido to become the leader of the team, the two becoming his teammates and eventual friends. They reach the finals, where they met the host of the tournament, a powerful fighter named Rugal Bernstein. Rugal boasts his desire to fight powerful opponents and challenges them. After his defeat, he self-destructs his ship in attempt to bring them with him, but the team escapes unharmed. Afterwards, Kyo decides to travel abroad in order to train. In the following year, Daimon and Benimaru were waiting for Kyo's ship to dock, when they were attacked by a masked assailant. Kyo returns and throws a fireball at the mysterious person, only to destroy her mask and reveal her to be Rugal's secretary. She hands over an invitation letter to another King of Fighters tournament, organized once again by Rugal, who survived his craft's self-destruction. This time, Rugal also brainwashed Kyo's missing father, Saisyu, into attacking his son. Kyo's father regains his senses after he was subdued by the team. To counter the team's strength, Rugal challenges them with power sapped from Orochi. However, Rugal's body was overwhelmed by the power's immensity and he was vaporized after his defeat. Pleased with his son's prowess, Saisyu leaves unnoticed, insinuating that he entrusts the clan's duty to Kyo. Prior to the events of The King of Fighters '96, a mysterious man -later revealed to be one of the \"Four Heavenly Kings\" of Orochi, Goenitz- challenges Kyo to a fight. Kyo arrives, powered by his overwhelming confidence in his fists, only to be defeated soundly by his challenger and sent to the hospital. In spite of his injuries, his anger and spirit from his loss drove him to invent powerful new techniques (this is the canon explanation for Kyo trading his projectile attack-based technique set for his now trademark flame-laced melee attack strings). He enters the year's tournament to prove his strength to his unknown attacker. In the tournament's finals, he meets the host of the tournament and the younger heiress of the Yata clan, Chizuru Kagura. At the tournament's end, he vanquishes Goenitz with Iori and Chizuru's help. Though he is warned by Chizuru of his clan's destiny with Orochi, Kyo ignores her and promptly departs. Before The King of Fighters '97 takes place, he is pestered by fellow high school student, Shingo Yabuki, to teach him how to create his flames. Though annoyed and flustered by his persistence, Kyo partially agrees to mentor him as a means of gaining free meals. He also experiences nightmares of a strange man defeating him at the King of Fighters tournament, but continues to participate. Before the tournament, his girlfriend, Yuki was kidnapped by the Hakkesshu, in order to be used as the last of the sacrificial maidens for Orochi's revival. Though it's ambiguous as to which team he enters during the tournament, it is canonly accepted that Kyo joins with Iori and Chizuru for its conclusion. He advances into the finals, where he confronts the remaining \"Four Heavenly Kings\" of Orochi, Yashiro Nanakase, Shermie, and Chris. The Hakkesshu also mention the plan to sacrifice Yuki in order to revive Orochi. Fueled by these turn of events, Kyo fights an emotional and heroic battle. When they are beaten, Orochi possesses Chris' body and attempts to destroy the three clans at once. As was done in the legends of their clans, the trio successfully defeat him. In a last-ditch effort, Orochi (manifested in Chris' body) causes Iori to enter the berserk Riot of the Blood state, expecting him to turn on Kyo and Chizuru. Instead, Iori snares Orochi by the neck, and Kyo obliged his rival by crippling the great demon with one last deathblow, allowing Chizuru to reseal Orochi. Exhausted, Kyo passes out. The last thing he sees is Yuki, saying that she will wait for him.NESTS Saga  The King of Fighters '99 took place immediately after the events of The King of Fighters '97. Still knocked out from his previous battle with the godlike Orochi, Kyo was taken by the NESTS syndicate and his DNA was used to make various beings for their purposes. He awoke one day to find himself surrounded by bizarre gadgets and needles. Deciding to search for answers, Kyo broke out of captivity and managed to escape the hidden fortress despite the sedatives. While escaping, he constantly heard references to the NESTS cartel. He tries to personally gain answers from his captors, but is forced to retreat when the base around him begins to collapse. He decides not to come back home before NESTS is taken down and attempts to investigate privately again the following year but learns very little. As the fiasco of South Town's destruction ensued, Iori confronts him and they fight to an unknown outcome. In The King of Fighters 2001, Kyo reunites with his old teammates and Shingo to make a comeback in the Japan Team. They join the now NESTS-sponsored KoF tournament to relive their time together as a team and to fight NESTS. They disband as soon as the tournament is over, leaving Shingo to muse about life. In the official novel, Japan Team makes it to the semi-finals, however he and Iori separate from their teammates and fight elsewhere. Like the fight in 2000, the outcome is unknown.Tales of Ash  In The King of Fighters 2003, Chizuru appeared to both Kyo and Iori, requesting that they form a team and investigate suspicious activities concerning the Orochi. Kyo initially protested allying with Iori (though Iori apparently did not do likewise), but relented to form the Sacred Treasures team. After the defeat of Mukai, the team then investigated the weakening Orochi seal that they had been transported to after Mukai's defeat, but were ambushed by Ash Crimson, who stole the Yata Mirror from Chizuru, promising to go after Iori next. Ash escaped, and Kyo swore vengeance. In The King of Fighters XI, Shingo has volunteered to join Kyo and Iori, in Chizuru's name. After several attempts, Kyo abides to Shingo's requests and joins forces with his groupie and his rival, in order to stop Ash. However, after he and his team defeat Magaki, the growing presence of the Orochi, caused Iori to snap and enter the Riot of the Blood state, and he trashed Kyo and Shingo in a berserk fit. Ash appeared thereafter and stole the Yasakani no Magatama within Iori's body, along with his flames. The Rival Team (Benimaru, Duo Lon, and Elisabeth Blanctorche) arrived after the incident, to whom Ash tells them that Kyo will be next. The incident had Kyo hospitalized, but he escapes rather than wait for his recovery. As he wanders the city, he encounters a mysterious boy and his female partner, who try to attack him. Showing them his flames, they hand him the \"R\" invitation before taking their leave. Soon after the encounter, Benimaru and Daimon find him. Seeing no need to visit the hospitalized Shingo or Chizuru, he reunites with his old team members to relive his past glory days together with them. After Ash disappears and Kyo's team won another tournament, Iori appears and challenges Kyo to a fight. Kyo accepts and the rivals fight to an undecided outcome.XIV Arc  When the tournament was announced, Saisyu informs Kyo of a new threat which will cause untold chaos. At his father request, Kyo enters the tournament once again with his old teammates. After the tournament's conclusion, Kyo advices Shun'ei to keep training to control his power. At the airport, after sending his teammates off, he heads to Hungary. Chizuru had called him there for his assistance in dealing with a revived, yet weakened Orochi, whom Iori found earlier.Personality  Kyo is the over-confident but well meaning protagonist of the series, more interested in enjoying life than having to partake in any particular responsibilities. He is quick to dismiss subjects that don't interest him and will often carry out his actions with a devil-may-care attitude. Despite his seemingly arrogant and rude demeanor, he treasures his friends and family, enjoying their presence and particularly doting on his girlfriend, Yuki. His extreme disinterest in studies has led to his chronic inability to graduate from high school (which has become subject to in-jokes). Although he is confident in his poetic talent, most of his poems aren't considered to be good by his listeners. Kyo takes his clan's responsibilities on a more personal level, disregarding ancient legends and predestined events as any reason for his actions. His strong sense of justice and his zeal to fight stronger opponents are what he believes to drive him to carry out his destiny. His rivalry with Iori is one of mutual hatred and was hardly spurred by their clans' history. When Kyo and Iori join forces, it is often begrudgingly and as a last resort solution to the conflict at hand.Powers Skills Fighting Style  Kyo fights using the Kusanagi style of ancient martial arts, a Japanese style of empty handed combat taught only to the Kusanagi clan members. Like most of the clan members in modern times, these are labeled as Method/Style with numbers; numbers that actually use alternate kanji different from their originals. These examples are 108 Shiki: Yami Barai (Method 108: Darkness Sweeper), etc. with \"Reverse Methods\" being stronger versions of other attacks such as Kyo's signature DM, Ura 108 Shiki: Orochinagi (Reverse Method 108: Great Serpent Mower) being an example. In some sources, this even applies to his \"unnamed\" normal attacks. Kyo also knows Kenpo, and uses it in most of his normal attacks. Kyo's moveset emphasizes Kenpo from KOF '96 onwards, discarding his 108 Shiki: Yami Barai and 101 Shiki: Oboroguruma (Method 101: Hazy Wheel), making way for a series of completely new techniques which are a series of chain punches (the 114 Shiki: Aragami/Method 114: Wild Bite and 115 Shiki: Dokugami/Method 115: Poison Bite) with several different followups, and thus adds a varying amount of kicks and elbow dropping attacks which are also types of notable moves in Kenpo. The names of Kyo's new moves are anything but vague and simple names (such as 402 Shiki: Batsu Yomi/Method 402: Punish Recital and 125 Shiki: Nanase/Method 125: Seven Rapids), possibly due to Kyo's taste for poetry. Thus, Kyo is a strong combo character that takes a while to master as his moveset from KOF '96 and following games explodes to ridiculous levels. Mastering it though allowed players to more easily adapt to use other characters that had more diverse movesets. Kyo made way for archetypes with moves that not only had multiple inputs, but each followup had its own unique features. This would also pave way for powerful mixups and combos if pressure was well-setup. Story-wise, this was possibly due to his initial defeat by Goenitz, Kyo reformed his style into a more-offensive focus. In the original games (especially in KOF '95), Kyo followed the \"Ryu and Ken\" archetype with Iori, as Kyo's moves differ slightly from game to game in the same manner as Iori, mainly their Desperation Moves. Changes in KOF '96 and onwards made them vastly different from each other. Alternate versions of Kyo would retain his old movesets from older games for nostalgia's sake, though each alternate version would be notably different from game to game. The 100 Shiki: Oniyaki (Method 100: Ogre Baker) is the one technique both Kyo and Iori still share to this day. In KOF 99 onwards, Kyo even applies personal touches derived from his father's techniques of the Kusanagi style, via his Hikigane (Plowing Iron) mimicking Saisyu's Kamukakari (Divine Consult) and even adapting his father's Nata Guruma (Hatchet Wheel) attack in KOF: Maximum Impact 2. In KOF 2003, Kyo, Iori, and Chizuru's LDM's are all named the San Shingi (Three Divine Arts), taking after their clans, destinies, and treasures. Kyo's San Shingi no Ichi (Three Divine Arts No. 1) however, is his SDM version Saishuu Kessen Ougi: Mu Shiki (Final Play-Off Secret Skill: No Method), as opposed to Iori and Chizuru's versions being original attacks. In The King of Fighters XII and XIII, his default self switches back to his old KOF '94/'95 moveset. His Neo Max in XIII, the Ama-No-Murakumo (Gathering Clouds of Heaven) is a reference to the original name of his heirloom. His NESTS-Style version uses his traditional \"Kenpo chain punch\" moveset, and is given a Neo Max named Saishuu Kessen Hiougi: Totsuka (Final Play-Off Hidden Secret Skill: Ten Fists), a nod to the famous Totsuka-no-Tsurugi (Sword of Ten Fists). Another possible nod is his 182 Shiki/Method 182, a powerful flaming punch attack, which may be the finishing blow dealt by Kyo to Orochi in the Orochi Saga's end (though in some other games, the 182 has a different animation, while its SDM version in XIV is a combination of its two different animations). Also, two other new moves in XIV that compliment his poetic taste are an overhead finishing move to his new low-attacking Munotsuchi (Six Mallets) followup from Aragami, and his Climax DM; they are respectively known as Tsurube Otoshi (Well Bucket Fall; a term for sinking quickly) and Yaegaki (Double Fences; a term for fences over fences). A notable trait that makes Kyo stand out in the Maximum Impact games is that while the input windows are fairly tight, some of his Stylish Arts are styled akin to a majority of crouching light kick-to-light punch normal attacks in the original 2D games.Music Image Songs Voice Actors Live Action Actors Game Appearances Mobile Appearances Cameo Appearances Anime Appearances Similar Characters See also Trivia References Iori Yagami  Iori Yagami (\u516b\u795e \u5eb5, Yagami Iori) is a character who made his first appearance in The King of Fighters '95. He is a central recurring character, and the initial enemy (and eventual rival) of Kyo Kusanagi. He is the heir to one of the three clans that sealed the legendary snake entity, Orochi, 1,800 years ago. His clan, formerly known as the Yasakani (\u516b\u5c3a\u74ca, Yasakani), wields pyrokinetic powers. They keep the seal over Orochi intact with help from the Kusanagi and Yata clans using three ancient artifacts. His family's treasure is the Yasakani Jewel (\u516b\u5c3a\u74ca\u66f2\u7389, Yasakani no Magatama) and his family crest is the crescent moon, which he wears on the back of his old jacket. He also wears a plain silver ring around his left middle finger; the significance of the ring, if any, is unknown. His official nickname is Flame of the End (\u7d42\u7109\u306e\u708e, Sh\u016ben no hon\u014d) . In XII and XIII it's Unbridled Instinct (\u89e3\u304d\u653e\u305f\u308c\u3057 \u672c\u80fd, Tokihanatareshi Honnou) and with his flames; Iori who has recovered his flames (\u708e \u3092 \u53d6\u308a\u623b\u3057\u305f \u5eb5, Honoo wo Tomoridoshita Iori). . Aside from the main body of the King of Fighters series, Iori features his own drama CD and character image album. His character is also a member of SNK's character image band, Band of Fighters and he also appears as a regular antagonist in the spin-off manga, The King of Fighters: Kyo. Part Time Stories: Kyo & Iori also co-star him and Kyo working together at SNK for the promotion of the company's merchandise.Development  One of the main objectives planned for The King of Fighters '95 was to properly introduce Iori as Kyo's rival. Creators have stated Iori's personality and other aspects to his character \"broke the mold for characters in fighting games at that time\". In several interviews for their official anniversary site for the series, several creators and developers\u2014such as C.A.C Yamasaki and Mr. Marito\u2014predicted that Iori would be popular on his release, which they admit happened during their observations of initial location testing for The King of Fighters '95. Because of his popularity amongst fans, some of the main designers for the series have stated that he is \"difficult to draw for\". Illustrator Shinkiro thought Iori as one of the series's most wild characters because of his hairstyle , with similar sentiments being made by Last Blade illustrator, TONKO and manhua artists Wing Yan and King Tung. Additionally, KOF: Maximum Impact producer, Falcoon, stated that attempting to change an \"untouchable\" design such as Iori's put him under severe pressure. He stated that designing Iori's alternate (or \"Another\", as it is stated in the Maximum Impact games) outfit almost felt \"unforgivable\", unsure of fans' reaction to the change. In an interview with a group of the series's voice actors, Kunihiko Yasui, Iori's voice actor, explains that the staff for the games treat their characters as normal people, and are constantly changing their character line-up to reflect this. He adds that he feels responsible as a voice actor for his performances as Iori, taking care to sound different in each instalment as a means of developing, as well as \"protecting\", his character's humanity. Another minor development to his character was his ever changing \"most valued possession/valued treasure\" information. His bios from KoF '95 until KoF '98 listed various items such as a vintage guitar and chains. A girlfriend was also listed more than once, specifically in KoF '95, KoF '99, and KoF 2000. However, starting in The King of Fighters 2001 and every entry onwards, the space is listed as \"None\". This has led to several fan theories as to why this is, many of which surrounds his girlfriend's possible death or disappearance. The issue is briefly touched upon years before in Iori's drama CD, The Sun and The Moon ~ Prologue, though a concise answer concerning this shade to his profile hasn't been made by SNK. According to Nobuyuki Kuroki, Iori was one of the characters he wanted to change, however he wanted the hair to remain untouched. He had the designer Eisuke Ogura create his new outfit and the end result impressed him. Additionally, he asked the modeller to have the character exude a masculine sex appeal and to also pay close attention to the details of his eyes. This new design, alongside Kyo's, provoked major controversy during the time it was revealed. However in an interview, The King of Fighters XIV director Yasuyuki Oda said the team wanted the characters to carry a new look due to the game being set in a new story arc. In the Neo Geo Freak's 1997 Volume 8 character poll, he was voted as the sixth favourite character with a total of 1,292 votes. 209 votes from the male fans and 1,083 votes from the female fans. In Gamest's 1997 Heroes Collection, Iori was voted as the staff's favorite character, claiming 1st place out of fifty other characters. He also received the same rank on Neo Geo Freak's website with a total of 3,792 votes. In a 2005 poll made by SNK-Playmore USA, he was voted as the eighth fan favorite character with 145 votes.Story Legend of Yasakani  660 years before the game takes place, Orochi's seal began to weaken. The three clans decided to move its vessel into another location. Wanting to disrupt their unity, one of the Hakkesshu killed the leader of the Yasakani's wife. Under a disguise, the murderer then approached the Yasakani head and reported that the Kusanagi clan was responsible, saying that it was \"atonement\" for letting the seal weaken. To add more fuel to the fire, the corpse of his wife was found in the Kusanagi homeland. Angered by the revelation, the Yasakani made a blood pact with Orochi to gain the necessary means for revenge. Gaining a forbidden technique called \"Kin Sen Hyaku Juuichi Shiki: Ya Otome\" (Forbidden Method 1211: Eight Maidens), the Yasakani renamed themselves as the Yagami clan. As a side-effect of the Orochi's curse, the once crimson flames of the Yagami have a bluish tint. The curse also causes each heir to die young and each mother to die in childbirth.Orochi Saga  Before the events of The King of Fighters '95 tournament, Billy Kane and Eiji Kisaragi end a sudden duel in a draw. Billy then introduces Eiji to Iori who comes in dragging the body of one of Geese's assassins. Overwhelmed by Iori's strength, Billy invites both Eiji and Iori to form the Rival team to enter the tournament. Iori joins them as a means to meet his rival. At the finals, he helps the hero team defeat Rugal Bernstein. Before Rugal dies, Iori mocks him for trying to use the power of Orochi. Claiming that such power could only belong to him, Iori severely injuries his fellow team members. He then declares Kyo and his clan will be next. Before the King of Fighters '96 tournament, Iori is visited by two mysterious women who introduce themselves as Vice and Mature. They tell him of Kyo's entry in the tournament and try to coerce him to join as well. After a brief fight, he agrees to enter once the two submit to be his servants, intending to use them to help him kill his rival. When he leaves, Vice and Mature contact their employer, Goenitz, ensuring him everything was going to their plan. During the finals of the tournament, he helps his rival and Chizuru Kagura, heir to the Yata clan, to defeat Goenitz. The former dies leaving a warning to not underestimate the power of Orochi or Yagami. Vice and Mature are left shaken by the ill omen. It is then when Iori suddenly undergoes symptoms of the Riot of the Blood. Unable to control this surge of Orochi power, Iori violently kills his companions. Before the events of the King of Fighters '97 tournament, Iori learns of his rival's entry from the local news. Later that night, he has a nightmare of two women mocking his inability to defeat Kyo. The women disappear with the promise of meeting him again soon. When he awakes, he coughs up blood. Filled with a sudden hate and rage, he declares to defeat his rival. However, at the tournament's conclusion, he joins both Kyo and Chizuru again. He advances into the finals, where he confronts the remaining \"Four Heavenly Kings\" of Orochi, Yashiro Nanakase, Shermie, and Chris. When they are beaten, Orochi possesses Chris' body and attempts to destroy the three clans at once. As was done in the legends of their clans, the trio successfully defeat him. In a last-ditch effort, Orochi causes Iori to enter the Riot of Blood, expecting him to turn on Kyo and Chizuru. Instead, Iori snares Orochi by the neck, and Kyo obliges his rival by crippling the great demon with one last deathblow, allowing Chizuru to reseal Orochi.NESTS Saga  Shortly after discovering the creation of clones of Kyo, Iori gained word of another King of Fighters tournament, and he began to suspect that the person responsible for cloning Kyo might be there. Iori followed the battles from the shadows, and eventually found an abandoned warehouse where Krizalid had fought the New Hero Team. The whereabouts of Iori were unknown after KOF '99, and it is assumed he cared little about Southtown and the events of KOF 2000, instead focusing on the opportunity for a fight against his rival. The next year, an agent named Seth invited Iori to join his team for the next King of Fighters tournament, under the presumption that he would get his shot against Kyo if he entered. Iori made it clear from the beginning of the tournament that teamwork was irrelevant, as he could take on whole teams by himself. In the official novel, during the time of the semi-finals, he and Kyo separate from their teams and fight elsewhere.Tales of Ash  In The King of Fighters 2003, Iori reluctantly teamed up again with Kyo and Chizuru Kagura at the latter's request, as it seemed that the current tournament might be linked to the Orochi. Before they could seal Orochi, Ash Crimson stole Chizuru's powers. He then made an offer of servitude to Iori, who answered with a fiery attack, which prompted Ash to disappear while Kyo swore revenge. With the defeat of Chizuru and the crippled Orochi seal spelling possible catastrophe, it seemed that the Yagami clan would soon be changed forever. In The King of Fighters XI, Iori agrees on Chizuru's request to team up with Kyo and Shingo Yabuki in hopes of opposing Ash. Iori and Kyo defeat Magaki, however the strengthening presence of Orochi caused Iori to enter the Riot of Blood, in which he trashed Kyo and Shingo before Ash Crimson appeared and stole Iori's sacred treasure, the Yasakani Jewel, and his power. Before the KOF XIII tournament, Iori pays a visit to Chizuru to see if she needs her treasure to use her power. Realizing that his predictions are true, she presents Iori with the prospect of ridding the Orochi curse from his bloodline since he is no longer hindered by his treasure. Uninterested in rectifying his family's mistake, he remarks that Chizuru's mirror will return in due time and leaves. With Mature and Vice haunting him to join the tournament with them, they perk his interest to settle matters with Ash. At the tournament's climax, Iori regains his treasure once Ash disappears. Mature and Vice remark that he can still choose to refuse the treasure, saving himself from the Orochi curse once and for all. He questions what will happen to his teammates if he should accept the treasure again, but they voice that he should choose whatever he thinks is right. He decides to reclaim his flames, his teammates disappear and he challenges Kyo to an undecided outcome.XIV Arc  Mature and Vice warn him of a new threat. During Verse's invasion, Iori senses the souls trapped within Verse. Once Verse is defeated, Iori tracks down Orochi's weakened soul in Hungary and helps to reseal it with Chizuru and Kyo.Personality  Iori is a serious, blunt and rude character. He is not interested in making friends or enemies, only showing investment in getting results that appeal to him. In various drama CDs, Iori is frequently tormented by an Orochi identity that resides within him, which mocks and belittles him as its \"master\". Iori can be sympathetic to other people, but his Orochi persona often threatens to take over and harm them. Iori tries to ignore it until it angers him, causing him to physically snap in a usually violent manner. In his KOF XII profile, he seems to have trouble knowing which identity is actually his and suffers from a slight identity crisis. It's due to this personal trait that he doesn't like to associate with others and he lives as a lone wolf. He still retains pride for his humanity and won't let himself die under any circumstances. The matter of losing his flames has not personally scarred or affected him in any way. Regarding his family duties and his ancient family feud, Iori doesn't care much for them. If the Orochi seal is threatened, however, Iori doesn't back down from the challenge of re-sealing it. His participation often provokes Kyo's pride enough to begrudgingly bring the Three Sacred Treasures together. Iori seems to want to clash with his rival whenever they meet; he can't recall the reasons why he hates Kyo. Like his rival, Iori just seems to instinctively hate him. Despite Iori's violent and sadistic personality, killing people in both Orochi Saga and NESTS Saga, he still follows his own moral code which was touched upon in The King of Fighters '97 \uff5e660nen Hi no Futari~. After brutally beating Shingo who challenged him to a fight, he tells Shingo that he isn't low enough to take pleasure in bullying the weak and promptly leaves. In regards to whomever he is partnered with, at best, he can be dismissive, distant and blunt but cooperative, and apathetic and treacherous at worst. Eiji Kisaragi and Billy Kane have seen the worst of Iori, while Kyo, Chizuru and Shingo has seen reasonably civil treatment from him despite being distant. He is notably dismissive, confrontational and even borderline traitorous when it comes to Vice and Mature, being his natural enemy; however, Vice and Mature have ironically shown some concern and care for his welfare.Powers Skills Fighting Style  Iori fights with the Yasakani style of ancient martial arts, which is a violent offensive style incorporating use of claws. He uses his instincts to fight as well. Like the other two clans, Iori's moves/clan techniques are numbered in a personal \"style/method\" order with alternate kanji used for the numbers. The only moves Iori has ever shared with Kyo are the 108 Shiki: Yami Barai (Method 108: Darkness Sweeper), and the 100 Shiki: Oniyaki (Method 100: Ogre Baker); the latter being the move they both share to this day. However, Kyo later discards the Darkness Sweeper in favor of his Kenpo chain punching style, making the two vastly different from each other. Like a few select characters, the naming even applies to his \"unnamed\" normal attacks in other sources. Iori's \"Riot of the Blood\" super in Neo Geo Battle Coliseum looks identical to the scene shown in his KoF '96 ending when he killed Mature and Vice. A majority of his clan's techniques have nods to the legends of Orochi as a possible foil to Kyo: In terms of gameplay, Iori is a powerful rushdown character with highly damaging combos. Players would need to be careful as failing to master Iori would prevent using him to his full potential. His most popular command normal, Geshiki: Yuri Ori (Outer Method: Lily Snapper), is a backwards kick that is meant only for crossing up making Iori unique in this aspect. In most games as of KoF '98, Iori can use it in a backdash for a quick getaway. From there, Iori conned the discovery of certain midair attacks being available during a backdash (which was presumed to be a bug at the time), such as Kyo's Geshiki: Naraku Otoshi (Outer Method: Abyssal Drop) and Robert's Hien Ryuujin Kyaku (Flying Swallow Dragon God Leg). Iori is surprisingly an avid zoning-type character, as his Yami Barai gives him an advantage in keep-away due to the movement styles in KoF. His Kuzukaze (Scum Wind, affectionately mistranslated as \"Scum Gale\") was also a unique kind of attack during its time as it was a throw that did no damage, and allowed Iori for a quick combo and provided massive pressure setups via tick throwing. It was originally his kick throw back in KOF95 before being repurposed as a command throw, being replaced by a variant of his punch throw, called Gyaku Saka Hagi. His moveset was fairly limited compared to Kyo's, but much easier to access. Because of his high potential overshadowing most of his weaknesses if played right, Iori is generally seen as top-tier in several of his appearances, and through his status as top-tier character, Iori can canonically in-universe be regarded as one of the most powerful fighters in the series, as so far any mention of him losing in the preliminaries is a rarity. His flame-less fighting style appears somewhat faster (albeit less mobile) in KoF XII; his combos seem to have become easier to chain with a slightly higher priority. His old \"With Flames\" version appears again on the console versions of KoF XIII, though some of this version's original touches have been stripped off for somewhat better balance compared to his default, flame-less version. His Neo Max in KoF XIII is called Kin 1218 Shiki: Yatagarasu (Forbidden Method 1218: Eight-Span Crow), a reference to the legendary creature of the same name; during this, Iori enters a brief feral state (with the screen darkening). With this in mind, it is assumed that Iori without his flames or his clan's curse hindering him, his true fighting instinct is unleashed and can be easily sensed by others (as noted by Takuma). In XIV however, Iori akin to other moves such as his SDM Ya Otome in older games and his Homura Hotogi (as either an HSDM/MAX2DM or Neo Max), undergoes a slight transformation into a crazed state more akin to the Riot of Blood when he uses the Yatagarasu. Also, Iori's San Shingi no Ni (The Divine Arts No. Two) is the very attack used to pin down Orochi in which Kyo manages to followup the finishing blow in the Sacred Treasures Team's ending of The King of Fighters '97. The very sequence is seen in Kyo and Iori's Special D-Assault in Neo Geo Battle Coliseum. Also, the technique is often named \"?????\" in Orochi Iori's moveset. Iori's (in)famous dropkick sweep attack is also notable for an oddity; while it is treated like a low-hitting attack when blocking it normally, it is instead treated as a mid-hitting attack when countered/reversed or against anything with low-level invincibility.Music Image Songs Voice Actors Live Action Actors Game Appearances Mobile Appearances Cameo Appearances Anime Appearances Similar Characters See also Trivia References Mai Shiranui  Mai Shiranui (\u4e0d\u77e5\u706b \u821e, Shiranui Mai) is a character from both the Fatal Fury and The King of Fighters series of fighting games by SNK. Her official nickname is The Alluring Ninja Girl (\u9b45\u60d1 \u306e \u5973\u5fcd\u8005, Miwaku no Kunoichi). She was originally not planned to be included in Fatal Fury at all, as her fighting style was created for a different male ninja. When developers shifted their focus to including an idol character into the series, they decided to scrap the Shiranui man for Mai. Her characteristic \"bounce\" was loosely modified from a kunoichi (female ninja) method of assassination: to be sensual to their unassuming prey before they strike. According to an issue of Neo Geo Freak, her breasts were modeled after Fumie Hosokawa and her bottom is modeled after the late-Ai Iijima; both women were famous idols at the time. Due to Mai's vast popularity among fans; she has been in most promotional art, game art, themes, and merchandise out of any character making her the female mascot and sex symbol of SNK. Mai was rated #4 in GameSpy.com's \"Top Ten Babes in Games\" feature and #5 in Game Informer's \"Top Ten Hottest Girls of the 16-Bit era.\" In the Neo Geo Freak's 1997 Volume 8 character poll, she was voted as the third favourite character with a total of 1,604 votes. 199 votes from the male fans and 1,405 votes from the female fans. In the character popularity poll on Neo Geo Freak's website, she was voted as the fifth favorite character with a total of 2,380 votes. On Falcoon's SNK 40th anniversary page he states that both Mai and Terry are his favourite SNK characters. Along with the many figures and merchandise that have been made in her image, she has made an outside game appearance in the spin off series Queens Gate.History Fatal Fury  Mai Shiranui is the granddaughter of Hanzo Shiranui, master of ninjitsu and Koppo-ken. Mai learned from her father the secrets of Ninjitsu. She had met Andy Bogard, during this time, who had come to train under her grandfather. Mai then had to take alternate courses from her grandfather's friend, Jubei Yamada in ninjitsu. At first, Mai was uninterested in Andy and only thought of him as another callous man only interested in his training. It wasn't until he gave her a present on her birthday that she saw him in another light and eventually fell in love with him. She spends much of the series endlessly pursuing Andy and fantasizing various daydreams about their wedding. When developers were asked about her whereabouts during Mark of the Wolves, they chose not to answer the question directly. However, they did divulge that she still loves Andy \u2014 as she always has \u2014 ten years later.The King of Fighters  During nearly every King of Fighters tournament, Mai pesters Andy to enter and form a team with her. Upset at his refusals and choice to join a separate team, she forms an all women team with the help of Yuri and King. In the following years her teammates change, but she remains firm to enter the tournament to help encourage King and her fellow team members and to prove to Andy the error of his ways. In King of Fighters 99, she is finally able to join the tournament in the same team as Andy. However, in the following tournament was asked to step out to allow Blue Mary investigate a case. Denied again, she is angered by the request and joins the Women's team again and has remained a reoccurring member ever since. In the various team endings, she is often celebrating the team's victory at King's bar or fantasizing about Andy. Mai did not participate in the KOF XI to search for Andy, who was busy at training his disiple, Hokutomaru. Later, Mai decides to enter the KOF XIII with her first KOF teammates, King and Yuri, as she felt that the KOF tournament isn't complete without her. She isn't upset at Andy while making her choice, content to enter a tournament with both her and him in it once more.Personality  Mai is a very cheerful and temperamental girl. She tends to also be somewhat of an airhead and admires any kind of beauty or attractiveness, which sometimes comes across as being vain. She also at times compares attractive boys who flirt with her or acknowledge her beauty to Andy, acknowledging their attractiveness but ending with a comment saying they're 'not as cute as Andy'. Like many girls, she has dreams of getting married to\u00a0her Prince Charming. She found that same Prince Charming in Andy and self-proclaimed herself his fianc\u00e9, which at times, has\u00a0creeped out Andy himself. A notable example of this is her intro with Andy in KOF97, proposing to Andy outright in a wedding dress, or scaring Andy with a mock child doll in KOF '99 and 2001. Despite this, Andy mutually acknowledges her love, but prefers to keep quiet about it. Although her peppy fighting persona suggests otherwise, Mai is actually a traditional and ideal Japanese beauty. However, her pride as a Shiranui ninja and infatuation with Andy usually keeps her from fitting the mold 100% of the time.Powers Skills Fighting Style  Mai uses the Shiranui-ryuu form of ninjutsu combined with her fire powers to fight. Her style resembles normal ninjutsu with more graceful and majestic moves, somewhat in reference to traditional Japanese dance. She also uses paper fans as weapons, integrating them into her combat technique and using them to perform several combinations and moves. Her clothing, specifically, the tassle on her ninja garb, is also used to attack the opponent. She's also exceptional in hand to hand combat using different throws and techniques to gain the upper hand. Mai has shown great Strength as well being strong enough to throw enemies heavier than her and using her strong elbow strike capable of breaking through her enemies defense's incapacitating them.Music Image Songs Voice Actors Live Action Actors Game Appearances Mobile Appearances Cameo Appearances Anime Appearances See also References Samurai Shodown (series)  Samurai Shodown, known in Japan as Samurai Spirits (\u30b5\u30e0\u30e9\u30a4\u30b9\u30d4\u30ea\u30c3\u30c4) is the name of a versus fighting game series by SNK. It is considered to be the premier 2D weapons fighter, and is one of the best-known video games created by SNK. Despite the name of the series, most of the characters are not samurai in the true sense of the word. In Japan, the name of the series is officially in katakana, but is alternately written in kanji (\u4f8d\u9b42, Samurai Damashii), with the second character pronounced supiritsu, \"spirits\", to better reflect the game's setting. The earlier arcade games are also notorious for their \"Engrish\", such as the word 'victoly' which appears at the end of each match. In fact, even the title is misspelled, although the recent additions of the series have since fixed this error. As with many game titles developed in Japan, Samurai Spirits had its name changed for other regions.Overview  The stories in the series takes place in 18th century Japan, during the Sakoku or seclusion period of Japan, (the first four games run across 1788 and 1789) with great artistic license so that foreign-born characters (including some from places that didn't exist as such in 1788) and fictional monsters can also be part of the story. The plot of each game is quite different, but they circle a central group of characters and a region in Japan. Samurai Shodown consequently portrays snippets of the Japanese culture and language internationally with little edits. For instance, unlike most American versions of Japanese video games, the characters in the series (including the announcer) generally speak only in Japanese, with dialects ranging from archaic formalities and theatricalism to modern-day slang. Win quotes and other cut scenes provide subtitles in several languages, including but not limited to English, Portuguese, and German. Much of the music includes traditional Japanese instruments (predominately the shakuhachi) and later enka. Several characters are loosely based on real people from Japanese history. There are two main artists responsible for the character designs and illustrations. For the early games (Part 1 to 4), the characters are created and illustrated by Shiroi Eiji. His illustrations featured a distinctive, traditional Japanese calligraphy style. While he continues to design for a few of the later games, they are illustrated by another artist named Kita Senri until the fifth title. The Samurai Shodown games are most famous for their \"POW\" or \"rage\" gauge, a super combo gauge that only increases as a player receives damage. Earlier games also have a referee in the background, officiating the match.Plot  Here is the official timeline taken from the official Samurai Shodown V website: The series begins during the Tenmei famine in Japan, which lead to a severe depression and near chaos throughout the country. Upset by his country men's lamentations and the shogun's indifference to their plight, former Tokugawa general, Kyogoku Hinowanokami Gaoh, stages a rebellion in his land, Hinowa, against the reigning Tokugawa. He also hopes that his revolt will make the next shogun in line, Yoshitora Tokugawa, realize his responsibilities to his country. The war caused by the conflict gains the interest from several warriors. At the war's end, Gaoh is defeated and Yoshitora is made the next shogun. More than a decade before the series begins, Shiro Tokisada Amakusa (loosely based on the historical figure), once the leader of a Christian rebellion, made a pact with an evil entity named Ambrosia moments before his execution. Using the body of Shinzo, one of Hanzo Hattori's sons, he resurrects himself two years after the events of Hinowa. He plans to get revenge on those who reigned against him, intending to resurrect Ambrosia into the mortal realm upon his release. He steals the sacred item, the Palenke Stone, from Green Hell to gain the necessary power he needs for the ritual. The sorcerer's activity stirs evil phenomena across the globe, stretching from Japan to China to Europe and America, drawing several brave warriors to their calamities' source. Amongst these warriors is Haohmaru, a ronin, who recently left his tutelage from his master, Caffine Nicotine. He sees the foe as a chance to sharpen his swordsmanship. An Ainu priestess, Nakoruru, though a pacifist, takes up her blade to save Mother Nature from further pain. Though several fighters attempt to slay the fiend, these two are successful in defeating him, apparently killing him in the process. Months later, another \"demon\" rises in Japan. However, he is not related to Amakusa or Ambrosia. He is a man named Zankuro Minazuki, a powerful warrior who has earned the label \"demon\" for his merciless slaughter of innocent people, village after village. Zankuro eventually finds the error of his ways and retires to hermitage, only agreeing to kill skillful warriors in duels. One of the victims he spared was a child whom Haohmaru finds and raises. The child's name is Shizumaru Hisame, who seeks revenge for his family's murder under Zankuro's hands. He sets out with Haohmaru to test their strength against Zankuro, challenging other fighters along the way. Eventually, they meet and duel, Shizumaru being the victor. Though Zankuro was heavily wounded, he tries to deliver a final blow only to be struck down by the heavens. He dies complementing the victor and his body is entombed. The grave doesn't last long, as Amakusa revives his efforts for revenge and steals the fallen warrior as an implement for destruction. This time, Amakusa's spirit is split into two halves; the original, good and just; the other, corrupt and ambitious. As the evil half brings destruction to Japan from Shimbara, the good half struggles to restores it. The evil Amakusa kidnaps a young kunoichi named Hazuki from the Kazuma ninja clan. Hazuki, adapt with ki and welding a special life force inside her, is used by the sorcerer to control Zankuro's bloodlust. Her brothers, Kazuki and Sougetsu, race to her rescue. Though several outcomes of this battle are interpreted, Kazuki is officially successful in slaying the evil Amakusa and Zankuro is finally put to rest by Sougetsu. Labeled nukenin, or rogue ninja, by their clan, Hazuki and Kazuki go into hiding while Sougetsu lets them escape. Six months after this conflict, a priestess possessed by the evil demon, Mizuki Rashojin, emerges to send the world into chaos again. Mizuki, as a loyal servant to Ambrosia from 1000 years ago, is awakened by evil from Amakusa's malevolent half. Her awakening causes several worldwide disasters, and though her spirit is awake, she has yet to ascend to the human realm. She preys on unlucky warrior's souls and uses the fallen to strengthen her and Ambrosia's powers. The good Amakusa saves Haohmaru and other virtuous souls but he too falls to her bane. Warriors travel to Hell itself to battle her soul before it resurrects. Haohmaru and Nakoruru are able to make the journey to Hell and stop Mizuki, sealing her into the Makai (demon world) after her defeat. Yuga the Destroyer, another being originating from the Makai realm, moves to conquer the world half a year after Mizuki's defeat. Twenty years prior to Amakusa's resurrection, it enters the human realm and steals various babies from mother's wombs and using its power, bestows superhuman abilities upon them. It silently re-inserts the unborn children, and waits for them to grow into superhuman warriors. Upon their adulthood, it appears before all of them and brainwashed all of them to become its loyal slaves through a magical puppet show. One of its victims is a mysterious woman named Shiki, the perfect female counterpart for Yuga's vessel. Yuga orders Shiki to find the perfect male counterpart, intending to merge the two for its eventual resurrection. Haohmaru is selected but Yuga underestimates him in their battle. Haohmaru defeats it and frees Shiki from its mind-control. A year passes, and Yuga, better prepared, revives itself. With its second appearance, Asura, a destructive being (which wreaks havoc in order to bring about \"the unification of this world and the Netherworld...\") escapes from his prison from the Netherworld. Yuga, realizing the strength of Asura, clones him and creates its loyal servant Hanmen no Asura. His orders are to reclaim Shiki and return to Yuga with her. However, he falls in love with Shiki and turns against his master. Both Asuras defeat Yuga entirely and merge together, leaving Shiki with a child. She leaves the child to Haohmaru's care, feeling unworthy of motherhood. Twenty years pass, with the age of samurai and swordsmen drawing to a close. Those not abiding to the peaceful change of era are outlawed to a prisoner island. Zealous inhabitants rise up and try to create a \"new world exclusively for the chosen ones\", whom are intent on destroying the shogunate. The group they form is called the \"League of the Three Blades of Domination\" and the island becomes known as Ritenkyo. Their leader is an old man named Oboro. A member of the shogunate, Seishiro Kuki, is ordered by his superiors to assassinate the ones responsible for the uprising. An older Haohmaru goes to find his \"niece\", Mikoto, and to free her from her torn past.Games In Other Media Anime/Manga  Additionally, various manhua have been printed for the series. One of them is currently being released in Hong Kong.Drama CDs Pachinko/Pachislot Games Card Game  In December 2006, Sabertooth Games released a Samurai Shodown V collectable card game set along with King of Fighters 2006 for it's Universal Fighting System (UFS) game. UFS is meant to be a universal system, as other games like Street Fighter and Soul Calibur III are also included into the series. Featured character starter decks were also released for Haohmaru and Ukyo Tachibana. STG staff favorites from the Samurai Shodown side tend to favor towards characters Nakoruru and Hanzo Hattori. The series also had a hanafuda deck printed with the series's characters.Characters Introduced in Samurai Shodown II Introduced in Samurai Shodown III Introduced in Samurai Shodown IV Introduced in Samurai Shodown RPG Introduced in Samurai Shodown 64 Introduced in Samurai Shodown 64-2 External Links Terry Bogard  Terry Bogard (\u30c6\u30ea\u30fc\u30fb\u30dc\u30ac\u30fc\u30c9, Ter\u012b Bog\u0101do) is the main protagonist of the Fatal Fury series. He has appeared in every Fatal Fury and King of Fighters game, and is one of the characters of choice to symbolize the company in crossover games, merchandise and publicity. He appears to fit many Japanese stereotypes for an American character in appearance, personality and speech (his in-game vocabulary is usually limited to American colloquialisms, such as \"Okay!\" and \"Hey, c'mon, c'mon.\"). Terry Bogard is the brother of Andy Bogard. Both of them were orphans adopted by Jeff Bogard. He is often referred to as the Legendary Hungry Wolf (from Garou Densetsu, meaning \"Legend of the Hungry Wolf\"). He has a pet monkey named Ukee (the previous mascot of SNK before Terry). He has a knack for scoring in basketball, which explains the creation of his Power Dunk move. In Gamest's 1997 Heroes Collection, Terry was voted as the staff's eighth favorite character. In Neo Geo Freak's 1997 Volume 8 character poll, he was voted as the fifteenth favourite character with a total of 690 votes. 270 votes from the male fans and 420 votes from the female fans. In a 2005 poll made by SNK Playmore USA, he was voted as the number one fan favorite character with a total of 10014 votes. He was voted as the second most favorite character at the time of Garou: Mark of the Wolves with one commenter saying that \"Terry's the eternal hero\". In the character popularity poll on Neo Geo Freak's website, he was voted as the fourth favorite character with a total of 2,479 votes. At Vigamus, a museum of videogames sponsored by the municipality of Rome, a special illustration lists Terry as the mascot of the early 90's era of Neo Geo.  On Falcoon's SNK 40th anniversary page he states that both Terry and Mai are his favourite SNK characters.Story Fatal Fury The Geese Howard Era  Terry and Andy were orphans who raised themselves on the streets. They were soon adopted by Jeff Bogard and eventually lived in Southtown. When Terry was 10, he witnessed the death of his father at the hands of Geese Howard. Knowing that they needed more training to confront Geese, the brothers made an oath to spend a decade to fine tune their martial arts before trying to avenge their father. Unlike his brother Andy, who left Southtown to train in Japan, Terry chose to wander in his home country, combining the skills learned from his father, his father's mentor Tung Fu Rue, and abilities gained from the streets. A decade later, the crime lord Geese Howard organized a tournament, dubbed The King of Fighters. Terry, Andy and Muay Thai Kickboxing champion Joe Higashi would enter with the purpose of facing Geese. The battle that followed would eventually see Terry defeating Geese, and for some time, it was thought that Geese perished in the battle. The next year saw Geese's half-brother Wolfgang Krauser take control of The King of Fighters, and bringing the once Southtown-only tournament onto the world stage. The finals of this new tournament would again see Terry fighting the sponsor and him ultimately defeating Krauser. During this event, he befriended many of the contestants and became a hero of Southtown. Some time later it was revealed that Geese had survived his encounter with Terry. The Bogards and friends learned of Geese's intentions to retrieve the legendary Jin scrolls, Terry once again challenged and defeated him. Afterwards, Geese fled. Terry faced\u00a0Yamazaki, then challenged the Jin brothers. Standing now as the victor, Terry once again was the champion. However, Geese had escaped with the scrolls. During the next game, Real Bout Fatal Fury, Terry managed to get all the way through the tournament to Geese for one final conflict. At the end of the fight, he knocked Geese off the edge of Geese Tower, but grabbed hold of Geese's hand and tried to keep him from falling. But this was not to be, as Geese knocked Terry's hand away, plummeting to what is believed to be his permanent death. Sometime after their final conflict, Terry encountered a boy by the name of Rock Howard (Geese's son). Taking him in, he would teach him how to fight as they travel together around the world.The Rock Howard Era  After the events of the Real Bout series of Fatal Fury, the story shifts to Second Southtown. Kain R. Heinlein, who was raised in Second South, claimed the city as his own and threatened to throw populace into chaos once more so that people could \"enjoy living\" once more. About 10 years after the events in Real Bout Fatal Fury, the King of Fighters: Maximum Mayhem (hosted and sponsored by Kain) would go underway, and Terry and Rock were invited to take part of the tournament. In Rock Howard's ending, Terry approaches the ruins of a mansion and finds out that Rock is now Kain's partner, and knows that he must trust Rock's decision to stick with Kain for a while. Terry then leaves the vicinity, knowing that Rock has finally left his den. After this, it is presumed Terry resumed his life of the lone wolf, leaving an uncertain future ahead. It is unknown whether Rock's ending is the canon ending, however. In his own ending he wanders Second Southtown thinking about what Kain told him about the nature of humanity. He decides that life is \"all about heart\" and Kain was wrong. Sometime after the Maximum Mayhem tournament, Terry is approached on an off day by Blue Mary on her motorcycle. Discussing over the whereabouts of Rock and the rumors that persist around him regarding the rise of Second Southtown as a city state, he is offered a ride by her to the Pao Pao Cafe, to gloss over the current case she is working on. In his development blog for KOF: Maximum Impact 2, Ureshino states that he doesn't know about Rock's mother or the true inheritor of Geese's legacy but hints that it would most likely conflict with Terry.The King of Fighters  The King of Fighters series reuses the Fatal Fury storyline wherein he receives an invitation to enter a new team fighting tournament called The King of Fighters '94. Since then, Terry has been in many installments as team captain of Team Fatal Fury. Though the team's roster has changed through the years, Terry has always been present. He also has a rivalry with Ryo which is mostly exclusive to this series. His reasons for joining each tournament in the early entries tends to center on Terry's concerns with Geese's possible involvement. His possible death was played on during The King of Fighters '99 where he stayed behind in the collapsing NESTS's base. He didn't contact with any of his friends or loved ones until a year later. In his time of absence, Terry tracked down NESTS's men who were targeting Mary. He decides to help her out in her job by teaming up with her in the 2000 and 2001 tournaments. He organizes his teams with various members in the following years, being the one to ask Tizoc in 2003 and Duck King into the team for KOF XI. To catch up and to reunite the legendary trio of Southtown, he joins up with his brother and Joe once more in KOF XIII. Before their meeting, he had to endure a long journey back to the city and fell asleep at the station. He calls up Mary to give him a ride to Paopao Cafe, and he cheerfully arrives over 30 minutes late. His tardiness and usual attitude for any tournament upsets Joe, who knows that he and Andy have their own responsibilities besides the tournament. Although Terry doesn't understand why his friend is upset, he has a sparring match with him in Paopao Cafe. Knowing that his fan, Alice, and Geese will be participating the new tournament, Terry joins to oversee her progress along with taking his usual vigilance regarding Geese.SNK Heroines  Terry's female appearance in the game is implied to be all a nightmare, including one scene where Rock Howard kicks him off the Geese Tower in a reimagined ending scene from Real Bout Fatal Fury. All these dissipates as Rock wakes him up for breakfast.Personality  Terry Bogard is an incredibly charismatic, cheerful and friendly man with everyone around him. He bears no ill will towards anyone other than Geese Howard, the killer of his adoptive father. His relationship with Andy is that of respect, recognizing his younger brother as his fiercest rival. He feels a sense of kinship with Blue Mary for her loss, and the two developed a long time relationship. He treats Rock as his son, but allows him to choose his own path in life. He teasingly calls Rock, \"Rookie\". Terry is also well-informed of what goes on in the streets.Powers Skills Fighting Style  Terry uses a mixture of boxing, karate, kung fu, kickboxing and street fighting moves to create a very unique fighting style, mixed in with chi techniques learned from his Hakkyokuseiken master, Tung Fu Rue. He had also learned martial arts directly from his adoptive father, Jeff Bogard. Other sources state his fighting experience was also gained from brawling on the streets for years to hone proper techniques for himself, where he tested out varying methods of fighting to his tastes. Terry is an all-around fighter, with extensive knowledge of many martial arts techniques. He uses many variations of punches, such as hooks and uppercuts and can also kick with ease. A majority of his techniques have a \"power naming\" motif, via Power Wave, Power Drive, Power Shoot and Power Geyser. Two of his signature moves, the Crack Shoot and Power Dunk, were inspired by Terry's love for basketball, in which the latter move was enhanced in The King of Fighters XIV and was renamed the \"Star Dunk Volcano\". In later years, Terry also developed a technique that ties into his wolf motif, named the Buster Wolf. He also in a few instances, creates a technique that has the same input scheme as Geese's Deadly Rave (as a possible tribute), known as the Rising Beat, which first debuted in SvC Chaos. Terry also pays tribute to Geese's son Rock by having his own version of his stronger-version Shine Knuckle, the Rising Force (which acts as his HSDM/MAX2DM). His well-rounded style also carries onward into his playstyle, where he has very well-rounded normal attacks and is a very basic character to play. However, one notable downside is that his special moves are all very laggy, forcing him to play a bit carefully when it comes to trying to land big damage.Music Image Songs Voice Actors Live Action Actors Game Appearances Mobile Appearances Cameo Appearances Anime Appearances Similar Characters See also Trivia References Ash Crimson  Ash Crimson (\u30a2\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30fb\u30af\u30ea\u30e0\u30be\u30f3, Asshu Kurimuzon) is the protagonist of the Ash Saga; his first appearance is in The King of Fighters 2003 as the leader of the New Hero Team. His official nickname is Sneering Firelight (\u5632\u7b11\u3046 \u706b\u5f71, Azawarau Hokage)  or The Sneering Blaze.Development  Ash was designed with the intent of creating an \"attractive evil character\" with little changes done to him since conception. During the initial planning stage for Ash, developers wanted to create a protagonist that has never been done for the franchise. Following this idea, they decided to create a feminine-looking and unheroic character to contrast the impact from the previous protagonists. Falcoon adds that the main goal for Ash was to make him an ambiguous hero that purposely makes players \"feel bad\" for cheering for him. Ash's character design was not made by Falcoon \u2014some of the development sketches for Ash's final design look closer to Nona's style. However, Falcoon did add extra details to Ash while illustrating him to better fit his character. KOF Maximum Impact: Regulation A earned its title for three reasons: arcade, arrange, and Ash. In a later interview, Falcoon relates that he asked permission from the 2D team to borrow Ash for the game.Story Tales of Ash  Ash is the descendant of Saiki. When he was living in France, he spent his childhood years with Elisabeth Blanctorche. For reasons still not entirely divulged, he left her household and the Blanctorche teachings. He enters the 2003 edition of The King of Fighters tournament alongside Duo Lon and Shen Woo. While his teammates leave him to solve their own vendettas, Ash goes to the Orochi seal where Kyo, Chizuru, and Iori are investigating. Ash ambushes a weakened Chizuru, robs her powers, and leaves her unconscious. He taunts that Iori will be next before fleeing from the scene. For KOF XI, he enters the next tournament with Shen and Oswald. After the tournament's events, he reveals to Oswald that Shen is the target he has been contracted to assassinate, a set up that Ash had in place before the tournament occurred. After leaving his teammates to fight amongst themselves, Ash takes advantage of Iori's unstable Riot of the Blood state to steal the Yasakani Jewel. Before he leaves the tournament grounds, Elisabeth Blanctorche and her team appears before him. She accuses Ash of abandoning \"their mission\" and fighting for personal gain. To intimidate her, he unleashes his new purple flames and disappears using the Yata Mirror. He warns them that Kyo is next. Prior to the KOF XIII tournament, Ash openly joins forces with Those from the Past and works for their master. During the tournament finals, his true motives are revealed: his previous actions were done to earn Saiki's trust and to gain enough power to rob Saiki's soul. He wants to end their bloodline. Ash carries out his true plan when Saiki finally lowers his guard, but Saiki's essence overwhelms him. After being defeated again by the winning team, Ash regains control of his body. Saiki insists that Ash enter the Time Gate, which will allow them to return to a previous era and begin their entire plan over again. Since Ash likes the current world, he allows the gate to close. His inaction erases both him and Saiki from time. Ash has a few moments to apologize to Elisabeth before disappearing. He leaves the stolen sacred treasures behind for Iori and Chizuru to reclaim.XIV Arc  Ash Crimson's act of erasing Saiki (and consequentially, his own self) from existence by orchestrating a temporal paradox (by trapping Saiki in the present time) sets up the events in the game, and resulted in the appearance of the entity known as Verse. After Verse's defeat, Ash's soul is released and is found by Kukri and Elisabeth on Carpathian Mountains in Ukraine. It is then highly implied, if not outright confirmed, that Ash is alive again.Personality  Ash is a cunning, self righteous, and flamboyant individual. Confident in his own powers, he doesn't take things too seriously and considers things that are of no interest bothersome. Even when faced with serious situations, he is calm and somewhat blas\u00e9. He isn't one who considers working with others, but instead uses others to achieve his goals. He tends to flaunt the superiority of his halfhearted effort and speaks in a playful and condescending manner, which often irritates the characters he is speaking to. He views Elisabeth as his older sister figure, and notes that she is \"too serious\". He feels that Duo Lon and Shen Woo are his good friends, although he appeared to them with mysterious intentions. He also has a habit of calling people pet names such as \"Betty\" for Elisabeth, and \"Ozzy\" for Oswald. His personality seems to slightly change when actively using the power of the Yasakani jewel. Usually calm and composed, when using his Fructidor move, Ash will laugh maniacally while making his opponent burn with the purple flames of the Yasakani. This behaviour is similar to Iori, and it may be interpreted as Orochi's taint affecting his mind.Powers Fighting Style  Ash fights using an acrobatic style combined with fire abilities to give a graceful fighting style. Despite his stature, he is extremely powerful. He is a good character for people who like to zone and poke their opponents, but he also has many other tools at the player's disposal that can be used to rush down efficiently, all while keeping the pressure on them. In KoF13, he also employs Iori's and Chizuru's powers into his moveset. Most of his moves refer to the French Revolution; they are named after months of the French Republican Calendar. His fighting style in general is similar to the French martial art of Savate.\u00a0Music Voice Actors Game Appearances Mobile Appearances Cameo Appearances Anime Appearances Similar Characters See also Trivia References The King of Fighters  The King of Fighters (\u30b6\u30fb\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u30fb\u30aa\u30d6\u30fb\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u30ba, Za Kingu Obu Fait\u0101zu), officially abbreviated KOF, is the most prominent series of fighting games by SNK. Its claim to fame is the large cast of characters and the innovative \"team\" system, with both original designs and characters from other SNK games. The series was originally developed for SNK's Neo Geo video game systems, which would continue until SNK retired the Neo Geo completely in 2004. For the next few games, the Atomiswave would be used, and later the Taito Type X2. Aside from this, ports of the arcade games and original The King of Fighters games have been released for the various consoles of then and now, such as SNK's own Neo Geo Pocket, the Game Boy and Game Boy Advance, the Sega Saturn and the Dreamcast, the PlayStation and Xbox series of consoles, and even the N-Gage, among others. The latest main game in the series, The King of Fighters XIV, was released on August 23, 2016 for PlayStation 4, and on June 15, 2017 for Steam.Overview  The first game in the series, The King of Fighters '94, was released by SNK in 1994. The game was designed to be a dream match of characters from the company's various arcade titles, particularly Fatal Fury, Art of Fighting, Ikari Warriors, and Psycho Soldier. The success of the game lead to SNK to release yearly installments of the series and numbered the games for the year they were released. With yearly sports games, each new version is meant to be an \"update\"; SNK did differently, making each year unique with new rules and a constantly changing character rosters even to this day. By 2004, SNK abandoned yearly releases of the series and usually numbered future games in a more traditional manner: the first main series game released as such was The King of Fighters XI. In 2004, SNK produced the first 3D installment of the series, KOF: Maximum Impact. The game and its two sequels use an alternate story for characters and settings from previous games of the series, leaning more towards the South Town-based series like FF and AOF. The producer of the Maximum Impact series, Falcoon, stated that the Maximum Impact games are in a different canon from the original series of games. The King of Fighters tournament, the namesake of this series, actually originated in Fatal Fury, a classic SNK fighting game that predated the KOF series. The later Art of Fighting was centered around an earlier iteration, featuring typical sponsor Geese Howard in a younger self. The King of Fighters games have had a number of villains as their individual end bosses. The first of these was Rugal Bernstein in  '94  who had a tendency to submerge his defeated foes in liquid metal, turning them into grisly trophies commemorating his victories. During the Orochi saga, Orochi is introduced as an ominous force from ancient times bent on revenge on those who imprisoned it and was aided by his four heralds. In later games, a mysterious organization called NESTS attempts to kidnap and succeeds in cloning Kyo Kusanagi in hopes of using his power to take over the world. The leader of NESTS, who called himself Igniz, hoped to amass enough power to become a god. Other villains in later games include Mukai and \"Those from the Past\" that he affiliates himself with, including Magaki, as well as the Mephistopheles group (Maximum Impact series). In order to preserve their characters' images, SNK ceased to age their characters since The King of Fighters '95 and they have remained the same ages since then. This means that characters introduced in The King of Fighters '94 have only aged one year in the series. To stay true to this theme, newer characters following this year also keep the same age they have when introduced. Some concessions to age and the passing of time exist, though, such as Terry's switch to his Garou outfit, or Kyo no longer being in high school since 1998. Ages have stopped being officially listed since KOF XI, likely to avoid confusion amongst fans.Games Other Media Comics Drama CDs Film and Animation Card Game  In December 2006, Sabertooth Games released a King of Fighters 2006 collectible card game set along with Samurai Shodown V for it's Universal Fighting System (UFS) game. Other games like Street Fighter and Soul Calibur III are also included into the series. Character started packs were released for Terry Bogard, Mai Shiranui, and eventually Rock Howard. Another trading card game was printed by the company Weib Shwarz on June 28, 2009. It's part of a campaign that allows collectors to exchange premium points for CDs and other collectibles.Pachinko Games  Three pachinko slot games were developed for the series. One follows the Orochi saga (The King of Fighters) and the other follows the NESTS saga (The King of Fighters 2). The newest one (Maximum Impact) focuses on the series's 3D titles. A fourth slot game (The King of Fighters III) covers the Ash saga. These machines remain exclusive to Japan.Mobile Games Characters Introduced in The King of Fighters '94  Brought from other games:Introduced in The King of Fighters '95  Brought from other games:Introduced in The King of Fighters '96  Brought from other games:Introduced in The King of Fighters '97  Brought from other games:Introduced in The King of Fighters: Kyo Introduced in The King of Fighters '99  Brought from other games:Introduced in The King of Fighters '99 Evolution Introduced in The King of Fighters EX Introduced in The King of Fighters 2000  Brought from other games:Introduced in The King of Fighters EX2 Introduced in The King of Fighters 2001 Introduced in The King of Fighters 2002 Introduced in The King of Fighters 2003  Brought from other games:Introduced in KOF: Maximum Impact  Brought from other games:Introduced in KOF: Maximum Impact 2  Brought from other games:Introduced in KOF Maximum Impact Regulation A  Brought from other games:Introduced in The King of Fighters 2002 Unlimited Match Introduced in The King of Fighters XII  Brought from other games:Introduced in The King of Fighters XIII  Brought from other games:Introduced in The King of Fighters XIV  Brought from other games:External Links K'  K' (K' (\u30b1\u30a4\u30fb\u30c0\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5), Kei Dasshu, pronounced as \"K Dash\"), sometimes known as \"K Prime\", is a character who debuted as the leader of the Hero Team in The King of Fighters '99. He stars as the reluctant hero in the NESTS saga of the series, often letting his partner Maxima handle any social necessities in his stead. To contrast the previous protagonist of the series, K' was made to be the \"dark hero\". His official nickname is He who surpasses K (K \u3092 \u8d85\u3048\u308b \u3082\u306e, K wo Koeru mono). In a 2005 poll made by SNK-Playmore USA, he was voted as the fourth fan favorite character with a total of 338 votes. In an interview with one of the manhua artist and authors, King Tung, he replies that K' is his favorite original character in the series.Development  The origins of both K\u2032 and Maxima can be found in the Psikyo arcade game The Fallen Angels (\u5815\u843d\u5929\u4f7f, Daraku Tenshi in Japan). This obscure 1998 release stars an emaciated goth in tight leather pants named Cool, along with a brawny, cybernetically enhanced US Marine named Harry Ness. The man responsible for the design of both characters, Shin'ichi Morioka, migrated to SNK shortly after The Fallen Angels was released, and elements of Cool and Harry Ness' design were used in the creation of K\u2032 and Maxima. The end result is that K\u2032 looks nearly identical to Cool. The idea of K' wearing shades was taken by another Fallen Angel character named Haiji Mibu. His namesake was taken from a clone character in the light novel Blue Knight Berserga Monogatari (\u9752\u306e\u9a0e\u58eb\u30d9\u30eb\u30bc\u30eb\u30ac\u7269\u8a9e), which is set in the same universe as the anime series Armored Trooper Votoms. During the early phases of development of The King of Fighters '99, K\u2032's introduction to the series was meant to remove popular characters Kyo Kusanagi and Iori Yagami from the roster, though this idea was later scrapped. C.A.C Yamasaki predicted that K' would be popular on his release, however this prediction never came true, in an interview he comments that K' was \"a little too plain.\" K' would later receive a slight redesign on his hair due to the protagonist of Garou: Mark of the Wolves looking just like K'. This caused the supervising designer to panic after realizing this.Story NESTS Saga  K' (real name unknown) was a normal child who lived happily with his sister, Seirah. One day, they were captured by NESTS, a crime syndicate who dealt with drugs, genetics, robotics and biotechnology. K' was kept under NESTS and trained to be some kind of weapon. In 1998, K' was made to participate in the Kusanagi cloning program. He was infused with Kyo Kusanagi's DNA, which gave him the power of pyrokinesis. During the program, K's memory was tinkered with, and he was made to believe that he was Krizalid's clone. Any real memories from his past has either been erased by NESTS, forgotten, or repressed. Under NESTS orders, he and Maxima joined the King of Fighters tournament with Benimaru Nikaido and Shingo Yabuki. The team makes it to the finals and are sent to a place where Krizalid waits for them. He poses as the tournament's host and fights them to gather their battle data energy. He hoped to use the data to activate the thousands of listless Kyo clones around the globe. However, K' defeats him and the team learns that Krizalid was merely a pawn for NESTS. Shortly afterward, Krizalid is executed by his superior. When the base collapses, K' and Maxima are divided from their team and hunted down by the Ikari squad. They survive the ambush and continue their resistance by leaving the organization. K's personal reason for doing so is find a way to regain his lost memories. The next year, K' and Maxima were joined by mercenaries Vanessa and Ramon. They entered the tournament to discover NESTS scheme, but Vanessa and Ramon were there to capture K' and Maxima at the end of the tournament, since they were working for Ling and Heidern. Their team makes it to the finals where they encounter Zero. Although K' defeats the traitor, they are unable to stop the Zero Cannon from firing. Unknown to them, Kula Diamond and her team destroy it and save the world from further damage. K' and Maxima are once again separated from their teammates after the tournament's climax. Whip finds them, reveals her relation to K', and joins their resistance effort. They spend the remainder of the year hunting down NESTS's bases around the globe. Though they have stumped some of the syndicate's plans, none of the bases were the main headquarters they were hoping for. K' and company enter the 2001 tournament with Lin, who tracked their movements in his personal hunt for Ron. Once his team makes it to the finals, they are lifted into a spaceship and are confronted by the real Zero. He reveals to the frustrated K' that they are on their way to the syndicate's main headquarters and will meet the real leader to NESTS. Once they reach the satellite, they meet Nests, Misty, and Igniz. Although Nests requests their neutral cooperation, he is quickly killed by Igniz. There, they learn that they are merely cyborgs (or clones) purely created for Igniz's personal entertainment (i.e. to become a new god). K' faces the villain and with some assistance from his team defeats him, which motivates Igniz to kamikaze the satellite to Earth. It harmlessly falls in the ocean - apparently thanks to Ron - with most of its passengers safe. Emerging from the wreck, K' forms an alliance with Kula and Diana. Both of them want to make their own future and make up for the time lost in their lives.Ash Saga  In 2003, Chin Gentsai visits K' and Maxima and requests that they enter the tournament. Chin, feeling a dark wave of energy around KOF that year, wants them to investigate it in his place. K' and company locate and face Mukai. K' Team defeats him, but K' was bothered by his taunts about regaining his memories, as well as reaching his true potential. Mukai's words continue to haunt him in the following tournament, leading K' to wonder if he can surpass his fate as \"the second Kusanagi flame\". At the end of the XI tournament, K' and his teammates were invited by Heidern to attend a lecture about the mysterious group known as Those from the Past. Heidern said he had Magaki's body, but they were attacked by two children who took the body away. K' had absolutely no interest in entering the KOF XIII tournament, and is upset when Chin calls him once more at his apartment with Maxima. Since he soon learns from Chin and Kula that they're in the newest tournament, K' is forced to enter against his own will. In their ending, the team spend their vacation on a cruise ship; Maxima told K' to enjoy the fun, but the latter didn't seem interested, while Kula seems to have more fun, making a giant splash around the pool, washing other people ashore. Maxima orders a big ice cream treat in a giant glass cup with many cones around, despite his eatery for sweets, and manages to finish it off. After that, agents appear out nowhere in the cruise, and the 3 prepare to fight the agents with the power of NESTS.XIV Arc  After the events of the previous tournament, the majority of their wanted posters had now been taken down in exchange for their strategic aid to Heidern and his forces. While this ended their status as suspected terrorist fugitives, it did not put an end to the shadowy organizations pursuing them. After K' and Maxima dealt with the pursuers, Kula contacts the duo, passing on a message related to former members of NESTS participating in the upcoming KOF tournament. In their ending, they were ordered to attend Heiderns meeting to pass on information related to Verse. Once K', Maxima and Kula board the helicopter Maxima informs his partner that several bodies have emerged from the fragments of Verse and that some of those bodies have records from previous competitions while some have no records at all.Personality  K' has a very serious and arrogant\u00a0personality but is very easy to enrage due to his more high-strung side. He is starting to treat Whip as a big sister and Kula as a little sister. He often calls Maxima names - like \"stupid\", \"idiot\", etc. - but he actually trusts his partner's reliability. He is hardly polite and is always gruff, even to those close to him. Because K' usually expresses his concerns in a \"tough guy\" manner, Maxima jokingly calls him dishonest or stiff. He sees Kyo as a rival and wants to prove he is better than him, not as only a clone. In KOF XIII, several fighters often point out K's rather immature personality (\"whiny\", lazy, anti-social and constantly rude to others) in their pre-fight dialogues against him. It is also pointed out he feels trapped in his life and is also rather very lazy and hates involving himself in most things he finds trivial, making him not unlike Iori Yagami in terms of nihilistic mindset (and the two ironically very much hate each other and are prone to nasty dialogue between one another for little reason). He, of course, despite his disinterest to partake in the KOF tournaments, at times often boasts about his abilities to take on anyone anytime, anywhere, which is something not quite far off from his capabilities as he also finds engaging in tasks with expected results to be yet another chore.Powers Fighting Style  K's fighting style is said to be \"Pure Violence\", but it has several similarities with Bruce Lee's Jeet Kune Do. He even uses some of his famous moves, such as the One inch punch and Flying Kicks. As a nod to hinting of said \"violence\", K's moves tend to show very brutal mannerisms due to his high-strung nature. This ranges from violent elbow strikes, enraged battle cries, and even resorting to throw his sunglasses at his foe and following up with a beatdown, no holds barred. Most of his mannerisms are either somewhat lazy (due to his disinterest in fighting), even to dozing off in battle via his idle stance when a certain amount of time passes; some/most of his flames tend to come from his right hand due to his limitations, but K' can work around this handicap in combat regardless, and is regarded as one of the best fighters in the KOF universe (as well as a high/top tier character in terms of gameplay in more later installments of the series). Despite his laziness, K' is shown to also be rather flexible (evidenced by his pre-KOF XI blowback attack, Second Shell, Minutes Spike, and Crow Bites Plus/classic jumping strong kick). His HSDM/MAX2DM, Crimson Star Road, is named after an episode of the anime series Legend of Galactic Heroes.Music Voice Actors Game Appearances Mobile Appearances Cameo Appearances Anime Appearances Similar Characters See Also Trivia References Athena Asamiya  Athena Asamiya (\u9ebb\u5bae \u30a2\u30c6\u30ca, Asamiya Atena) is a character originally from Psycho Soldier and a distant relative and modern-day counterpart of Princess Athena from Athena. She later appears as a regular fighter in The King of Fighters series; she is perhaps best known for changing her outfit and hair style for virtually every main installment. She stars in her own ADV game Athena: Awakening from the Ordinary Life that was only released in Japan for the Sony PlayStation in 1999. Athena was a highly anticipated character for the King of Fighters lineup and developers relate that they are constantly working to keep her in the series. Throughout the years, her sailor uniform outfit was a frequent request from Japanese fans that was denied due to the belief that it wouldn't translate well with the overseas audience (this kept up until recent installments). Her official nickname is The Psychic-Powered Idol.Nona, one of the series designers, reply that Athena is his favorite original character in the series. In the Neo Geo Freak's 1997 Volume 8 character poll, she was voted as the eighth favourite character with a total of 1,139 votes. 833 votes from the male fans and 306 votes from the female fans. In the character popularity poll on Neo Geo Freak's website, she was voted as the tenth favorite character with a total of 1,020 votes.Story  Athena is a modern day high school girl in Japan. She teamed up with her friend, Sie Kensou, to fight in the name of justice. In Psycho Soldiers, she was one of the \"heroes of light\" who defended the world from the Shiguma forces. Her psychic powers are believed to be transmigrated to her rather than inherited by her family. As such, she is sometimes referred to as the resurrected Athena who is gifted with esper-like powers.Orochi Saga  In the King of Fighters series, she is a student of Kensou's Kenpo teacher, Chin Gentsai. She has spent most of her life secluded in China's mountains training. Her team participates in the tournaments as a form of training and to save the populace from an apparent future threat. Other times, they enter to disrupt any evil forces they may feel at the time. In the 1996 tournament, Chin seemed perturbed by the energy he sensed and didn't want his students to be involved with it. However, they surprise him by redoubling their enthusiasm for the event and they enter. Their success in the tournament is shown in the following year where they receive a mountain of adoring fan letters. Athena in particular had a boost in popularity and stardom. However, Chin rejects their proposal to enter King of Fighters since he doesn't want his students to forget the purpose of their training. Determined to change his mind, Athena presents him with an inspirational letter from Kaoru Watabe. The contents in the letter helps her argument that their publicity moves people to do better things, which is essentially another way of saving people. Convinced that his students are improving, he allows them to enter once more. In the aftermath of KOF '97, the Psycho Soldiers meet Kaoru, who now travels with them to most of their engagements and was even a striker in KOF 2000.NESTS Saga  By this time in the series, Athena becomes a famous pop-star who is rising the charts with her concerts. She welcomes the new recruit, Bao, warmly and hopes that he does his best. Additionally, she grows concerned for Kensou once he lost his powers though she remains optimistic that they might return during the tournament on a spur-of-the-moment notice. Her team's backstory in The King of Fighters 99 reveals that the team was there during the collapse of NESTS's base in the finals. During that time, Athena was caught underneath the falling rubble and passed out. Though he has no memory of it, Kensou saved her with a formidable latent energy. Ever since then, Bao suffered from a mysterious fatigue and illness. This same energy is later revealed to be the \"Dragon's Spirit\". Though she has her doubts with her master's methods, she wearily agrees to join the tournaments in this saga to treat Bao and Kensou's predicament. In the team's story in The King of Fighters 2000 she, Chin and Kaoru Watabe witness Bao's near heroic sacrifice as he takes a the NESTS satellite's energy beam to protect them, and how this leads to Kensou recovering his powers when he absorbs the rest of the energy.Ash Saga  For the first time since the beginning of KOF, the Psycho Soldiers did not enter the tournament in KOF 2003 since Kensou and Bao went on a year long training mission with Chin to master Kensou's unreliable \"Dragon's Spirit\". Not wanting to miss out on her annual fix of tournament competition, Athena joined forces with Hinako Shijou and Malin to form the High School Girls team, a strange but rather successful partnership. For KOF XI, Athena reunites with Kensou after his year of training, and Momoko, one of Athena's fans with psychic capabilities.Personality  Athena is very outgoing, polite, and friendly. A happy girl with righteous virtues and well-meaning morals, she treasures her fans and those who are helpless\u00a0and\u00a0strives to\u00a0do her best to fight for them, though she can be a bit of a crybaby at times.\u00a0 Athena often chides Kensou for slacking off in his training. She either is well aware of his crush on her, but usually chooses to ignore his romantic advances since he seems to embarrass her, or she is oblivious about his romantic interest in her.\u00a0Powers Skills Fighting Style  Athena was taught Kung Fu by Chin Gentsai, probably the style of Wing Chun. Her stance was loosely based on Liuhebafa. While Athena is a capable hand-to-hand fighter, she mostly relies on her psychic powers to fight. Athena is not feared for her martial arts training, but she is respected and can somewhat hold her own against some fighters. Athena's fighting style revolves mostly around simple yet effective strikes, and around speed and acrobacies, rather than strength. She uses her psychic powers to full effectiveness when in combat, improving her martial capabilities, controlling the battlefield and getting the enemy off guard with several surprise tactics.Music Image Songs Voice Actors Live Action Actors Game Appearances Mobile Appearances Cameo Appearances Anime Appearances Similar Characters See also References Kula Diamond  Kula Diamond (\u30af\u30fc\u30e9\u30fb\u30c0\u30a4\u30a2\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9, K\u016bra Daiamondo) first appeared as the sub-boss in The King of Fighters 2000.

Her original hair color is strawberry blonde (confirmed after the game's release), but changes to a light blue when she activates her powers. She's often seen with her companions, Diana, Foxy and Candy Diamond. Her official nickname is Ice Doll (\u30a2\u30a4\u30b9 \u30c9\u30fc\u30eb, Aisu d\u014dru). At Vigamus, a museum of videogames sponsored by the municipality of Rome, a special illustration lists Kula as the mascot of the new millennium era of Neo Geo.Development  She was designed to be the antagonistic foil to K', in an attempt to better develop characteristics of the NESTS cartel. She was specially made with attempts to depict a 14-year-old girl with \"appropriately girlish\" gestures with help from the newly hired female staff. Her actual design was left to the veteran supervising designer.Story  Kula Diamond is a being created with the codename Anti-K by NESTS to exterminate the cartel's traitor, K'. She possesses the same design as K', and her clothes are almost identical to K's, with DNA altered to use ice powers instead. As a side effect of her surgery, her mental state has been turned back to that of a child. Despite the fact that their subject was a mindless puppet with no sign of emotions (aside from being an innocent young girl), the NESTS cartel was not willing to repeat the same mistake they made with K'. Therefore, NESTS created an android called Candy Diamond, who would monitor Kula's behavior and assure that Kula would accomplish her missions, providing assistance in battle if she was needed. NESTS also assigned two of their top agents (Diana and Foxy) to supervise and prevent any sort of betrayal by Kula. She is often ordered by either Diana or Foxy to exterminate other traitors to NESTS -such as Zero or Igniz- but has been known to disobey her orders for the sake of others, such as the destruction of the Zero Cannon. After NESTS's destruction, she allies herself on friendly terms with her target, K' and his companions, understanding that both their lives were ruined by NESTS. Whip affectionately refers to her as the \"little sister\" of the group. Prior to the KOF XIII tournament, she was staying with K' and Maxima at their apartment. She became cellphone buddies with Chin Gentsai, who promised that she would get a lot of ice cream if she entered the tournament with her comrades. With Whip asking her to do the same, she entered herself and her teammates in the KOF XIII tournament. In the Maximum Impact series, Kula accepts to enter in the tournament to search for Dr. Makishima under the orders of Heidern, as the doctor is needed to repair Maxima's failing nuclear core. During the tournament, she finds a rival in the form of Nagase, and defeats her, with the latter swearing revenge for the humiliation she suffered. Kula eventually discovers that the doctor had been taken elsewhere, and leaves the tournament.Personality  Before being a killer, Kula is a child. While working for NESTS or for Diana and Foxy, she would not fail to kill anyone she finds unworthy. During her time with NESTS, her feelings were repressed, as she was portrayed as a cold girl executing her mission. She has since been defrosted into being more childish as of late. Kula is trying hard to establish herself as a humane person, so people don't look at her as if she is some kind of weapon, she doesn't use her powers to full extend so she doesn't kill anyone by accident, because she fears that it would make her go back to her previous ways, so she prefers close combat instead. After beating her opponents Kula is usually worried about them. Despite being this sweet innocent girl, Kula has some anger management issues. They are mostly the results of people either talking down to her, underestimating her, or reminding her of her origins and calling her a weapon. She also gets angry when she sees flames.Powers Fighting Style  As the Anti-K', her fighting style is primarily based on K's (with her sharing his One-inch punch being a prime example), but adapted to her ice-based powers. She also fights using her ice skates, which are able to cut easily through flesh. She has high flexibility, which allows her to kick high and with ease, so she can use her skates to their full extent. Kula is very acrobatic and agile, mostly relying on her speed and ice powers rather than brutal strength, though she still can concentrate her strength on a single hit. Some of her moves (such as One Inch Punch) can send characters as big as Chang Koehan flying across the stage. Some of her moves also resemble ice dancing. She also employs the help of her friends, Foxy, Candy and Diana, primarily the latter.Music Voice Actors Game Appearances Mobile Appearances Cameo Appearances Anime Appearances See also Trivia References Leona  Leona (\u30ec\u30aa\u30ca, Reona), also known under her codename Leona Heidern (\u30ec\u30aa\u30ca\u30fb\u30cf\u30a4\u30c7\u30eb\u30f3, Reona Haiderun), is a character introduced in The King of Fighters '96 as the new member to the Ikari Team. Before production for her debut game began, developers wanted to create a suitable replacement for Heidern as a part of the game's overhaul. Leona was conceived to be an Orochi descendant by the time of her debut and her designers took special care to let their interests at the time reflect in her actions.  Her official nickname is The Silent Soldier (\u30b5\u30a4\u30ec\u30f3\u30c8 \u30bd\u30eb\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc). In an interview with one of the series designers, Shinkiro, he replies that Leona is his favorite original character in the series. Logo and character designer Nao Q also has Leona as his favourite character, he comments on his soft spot for ice maidens.Garou: Mark of the Wolves planner and The King of Fighters XIV producer Yasuyuki Oda states that Leona and Kyo are his favourite characters in The King of Fighters series. In the Neo Geo Freak's 1997 Volume 8 character poll, she was voted as the fourth favourite character with a total of 1,458 votes. 187 votes from the male fans and 1,271 votes from the female fans. Aside from the main body of the King of Fighters series, Leona is also featured in a one-shot chapter in the spin-off manga, The King of Fighters: Kyo and has her own character image album.Story Orochi Saga  Leona was born in an unnamed village, residing with her family. When she was a child, Goenitz arrived at her home and demanded to talk with Gaidel, the leader of the village. He requested that Gaidel join him in their duties to serve Orochi, as everyone in the village were Orochi bloodline members. However, Gaidel refused as he and his family liked peace and not the violent tendencies created by the Orochi blood. Enraged, Goenitz leaves; the same night, Leona underwent the Riot of Blood and slaughtered everyone in the village. Goenitz, pleased by the results, puts her blood lust to rest for another time \"when he needs her again\". Dazed and shocked, she loses her memories and wanders aimlessly until she is found and later adopted by Heidern. Surprised by her natural fighting ability, he decides to raise her as a Ikari warrior under his command. In 1996, she receives her first official mission to enter the King of Fighters tournament with Ralf and Clark. Their mission was to investigate Geese Howard who had entered the tournament in search of an unknown goal. During the events of the '96 finals, Goenitz confronts her and reminds her of her Orochi lineage, causing her to worry about the future. Her troubled state carried over to the battlefield, which eventually lead to her and her partners' suspension from military service. Wanting to cheer her up, Ralf enlists them again in the the next year's tournament. She eventually remembers her past fully during the events of King of Fighters '97. Towards the tournament finals, Leona undergoes the Riot of the Blood induced by Orochi. By the tournament's end, she is successfully subdued and Orochi is sealed away. Even so, Leona regrets her actions and attempts to end her life. Ralf stops her, and encourages her to continue living.NESTS Saga  Leona stays as a member of Ikari team for each and every King of Fighters tournaments during the NESTS saga. It was assumed she partook in her normal duties with Heidern during this time frame.Ash Saga  At the end of the tournament in 2003, Orochi's seal is broken. She enters the Riot of the Blood and attacks Ralf and Clark, badly injuring them. She is pulled out of the team by Heidern in The King of Fighters XI due to the emotional trauma she suffered after the incident. Overcoming the shock, she is designated to join the KOF XIII tournament with her old teammates, determined to live with whatever flaws the Orochi blood invokes. After the tournament's climax, she loses consciousness and sleeps for several days. Her teammates were worried for her and stay beside her until she awakens. Comforted by their concerns, she laughs for the first time in the series.Personality  Leona is a reticent individual who has trouble expressing herself outside of combat or a mission. Due to her past, she often keeps her emotions in check as she is afraid of losing control and hurting her friends because of her Orochi blood. Aside from Ralf, Whip, Clark and Commander Heidern, Leona does not talk to anyone. She often feels lonely, but is comforted with the new family she has found with the Ikari mercenaries. Ever since the attempted suicide, Leona resolves to take control of her own Orochi blood, using it only when the situation calls for it, something that she tells her opponents in her own pre-fight dialogues.Powers Fighting Style  She shares several moves with her adoptive father, Heidern, and she also seems to emulate Ralf's moves. For example; her CD/Blowback attack is almost akin to Ralf's. Also as the games progress, her moves seem to become more explosive much like Ralf's and her style of running changing from being like Heidern's to like Ralf's, but at the same time still maintaining her more agile techniques taught by Heidern; unlike Heidern however, she has more apparent differences in her techniques via extra variations that focus more on speed and acrobatics. The V-shaped slashmarks that appear at the end of her V-Slasher DM and SDM are an homage to Choudenji Machine Voltes V -- the titular giant robot had an attack in which it made a V-shaped slash through the enemy, leaving a glowing V for a few dramatic moments before it is destroyed. Her Rebel Spark Desperation Move and Super Desperation Move where she plants an explosive on her opponent then moving away from the opponent while making a pose, is actually a homage to Kamen Rider Black RX -- a Japanese tokusatsu show where the hero impaled his enemy with his sword, Revolcane, and proceed to do the same pose as sparks came out from his opponent's belly and eventually exploded. Also, her jumping CD/Blowback attack resembles Kamen Rider Black's version of the Rider Kick, owing to the sudden, unexplained glow of reddish energy around her foot, and being performed while in the air. Another sentai homage includes her exploding earrings (Himitsu Sentai Goranger). The air throw\u00a0she shares with Heidern\u00a0(Heidern/Leona Inferno)\u00a0takes its name and appearance from Kinnikuman Zebra's \"Muscle Inferno\" attack\u00a0in Kinnikuman. Two of her moves are\u00a0references to JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Her other moves take their namesakes from Grendizer.Music Voice Actors Game Appearances Mobile Appearances Cameo Appearances Anime Appearances Similar Characters See also Trivia References Yuri Sakazaki  Yuri Sakazaki (\u30e6\u30ea\u30fb\u30b5\u30ab\u30b6\u30ad or \u5742\u5d0e \u767e\u5408, Sakazaki Yuri) is a character introduced in the Art of Fighting series as a damsel in distress and eventually as a playable character. Since then, she has appeared in many SNK fighting games, alongside her older brother, Ryo Sakazaki. She is the first female practitioner of Kyokugenryu Karate. Her official nickname is Wild Flying Swallow. In the Neo Geo Freak's 1997 Volume 8 character poll, she was voted as the tenth favourite character with a total of 944 votes. In the character popularity poll on Neo Geo Freak's website, she was voted as the nineteenth favorite character with a total of 726 votes.History Art of Fighting  As a child, Takuma dedicated more time training Ryo to be next family heir rather than raising Yuri. When she was six years old, her mother died in a tragic car accident. Sensing his family was being targeted, their father leaves in order to protect them. With the loss of both parents, she becomes fearful and heavily dependent on Ryo for the rest of their childhood. When she first meets Robert, she does not trust him but eventually warms up to him. When she was 17, Yuri was kidnapped by Mr. Big on behalf of Geese Howard as part of a ploy to blackmail her father. Ryo and Robert search Southtown to find her whereabouts and rescue her. While held hostage, she finds out the identity of Mr. Karate. When Ryo defeats her captors, she reveals it to her brother and the family is reunited. In order to protect herself in the future, Takuma teaches her how to fight much to Ryo and Robert's chagrin. He trained Yuri in secret, but only taught her enough to defend herself. She becomes worried about Robert when he doesn't appear for their date before Art of Fighting 3. Setting out with her brother, they search for him in Glasshill. During their trip, she is wounded by Sinclair and briefly hospitalized. If the player plays through Robert's story, a strained Yuri appears to assist his plight against Wyler. She is healthy enough to leave with Robert by the end of the game's events. According to Ryo, she and Robert are still single by the time Buriki One takes place. She likely stayed at home to help the family business, as she is close enough to her brother to tell him to shave off the hair from his chin.The King of Fighters  Yuri, now confident in her fighting prowess, decides to enter the tournament, but is denied to enter by her brother. She defies his wishes and enters with King and Mai. It isn't until the 1996 tournament that they finally form a team together to represent the prestige of Kyokugenryu to the world. She is forced to join when Takuma gives her an ultimatum to either enter with Ryo or leave the house. After the 1999 King of Fighters tournament, Yuri wanted to once again show her independence. She begs King to take her place for the year and joins the Women's Team. In 2001, Robert reveals to the family that his family business is in trouble. They decide to all enter together to win the prize money and help out Robert's situation. Since 2001, Yuri then has been a regular for the Art of Fighting team alongside Ryo and Robert. In The King of Fighters XI, Yuri has a rival in the form of Malin. She stuns her father with her whimsical haircut before KOF XIII and is upset by her family's eccentric reactions. Since the rising skill of martial artists in the tournaments outclasses her basic training, Robert informs her of her brother and father's wishes to quit Karate for her own safety. Optimistic in her attempts to improve herself, however, she teams with Mai and King for the newest tournament. By the time of The King of Fighters XIV, the Sakazaki family has opened a Kyokugen BBQ restaurant with the help of Richard Meyer.Personality  Yuri Sakazaki is a friendly young girl who always cares about her family and friends. She is a strong believer of innovation and trends, constantly finding ways to improve herself through change. She is often arguing with her father and Ryo over matters regarding her newfound sense of independence. In the Art of Fighting series, it is heavily implied that she has a romantic interest in Robert after her kidnapping. As of Art of Fighting 3, she is confirmed to be in a relationship with Robert. Thought still present to a certain degree, this attraction and relationship is downplayed in the King of Fighters series.Powers Fighting Style  Yuri uses the lowest-grade version of the Kyokugenryu Karate discipline, and is taught only the basic and low-level moves. To prove her own worth, she personally arranges the style to better fit her physique and persona. Among her own moves are the Slipstream Handslap/Hyakuretsu Binta (Hundred Rending Face Slaps), the Big Butt Press/En'yoku (Swallow Wing), Hien Hou'ou Kyaku (Flying Swallow Fenghuang Leg), and the more popular Yuri Chou Upper (Yuri Super Upper) with its added variations. Later in KOF 2002 UM, she even manages to create her own version of the Kyokugen-style's signature Ryuuko Ranbu (Dragon Tiger Wild Dance). Several of her techniques also have a flying swallow-naming motif. Yuri's moveset is a running parody of various special moves from the Street Fighter series. This is very noticeable in The King of Fighters '96, when she received her Yuri Chou Mawashi Geri (Yuri Super Spin Kick), which was similar to Sakura's Shunpuu Kyaku. Yuri has since then received various moves and other mannerisms that are parodies of these (both Capcom and SNK alike): It is notable that KOF '96 came out exactly one year after Street Fighter Alpha, where Dan Hibiki (a character that parodies both Ryo and Robert) was introduced. It is because of this that Yuri can sometimes be taken as the counter-parody character from SNK to Capcom, given the impression \"even a basic level Kyokugenryu Karate can perform\u00a0Ansatsuken techniques\". Likewise, her classic attacks also have alternate character readings which may or may not parallel the original Kyokugenryu's existing techniques; Yuri Chou Knuckle's literal kanji reading is \"Hien Shippuu Ken\" (Flying Swallow Hurricane Fist), Yuri Chou Upper's literal reading is \"Kuuga\" (Air Fang; the followup is Ura Kuuga/Reverse Air Fang, read by Yuri as \"Double Chou Upper\"), the Yuri Chou Mawashi Geri her own version of the Hien Shippuu Kyaku (Flying Swallow Hurricane Leg) and so forth. In some games, when Yuri is knocked out with a special move, the top of her costume is torn off, exposing her bra. This happens in Art of Fighting 2, The King of Fighters '94, The King of Fighters '95, The King of Fighters XIII and The King of Fighters XIV, though in the latter case, her bra is not fully exposed. In Capcom vs. SNK 2, when Yuri finishes a fight with a \"Finest KO\" (finish with a super move as a counter to an opponent's special or super move), she will attempt to tie her gi tighter. However, the belt becomes completely undone and her top opens, revealing a semi sheer undershirt. Yuri will then blush in total embarrassment and immediately cover herself. This victory pose first appeared in Art of Fighting 2 when Yuri scores a Perfect victory.Music Image Songs Voice Actors Live Action Actors Game Appearances Mobile Appearances Cameo Appearances Anime Appearances See also Trivia King  King (\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0, Kingu) is a character in both Art of Fighting and The King of Fighters series. She debuted in the original Art of Fighting as the sole playable female character. Her official nickname is The Beautiful Kick's Illusion (\u7f8e\u3057\u304d \u8e74\u6483 \u306e \u30a4\u30eb\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3, Utsukushiki Ketsu no Illusion). King's appearance in the first game was made to hide her gender, with the game's flyer even using he to refer the character. According to an interview  with her designer, King was primarily inspired and modeled after Jamaican singer, Grace Jones. During the concept stage they took additional inspiration from the henchwoman character in the Hong Kong film China White , performed by Dutch Muay Thai action actress Saskia Van Rijswijk. In the Neo Geo Freak's 1997 Volume 8 character poll, she was voted as the sixteenth favourite character with a total of 616 votes.Story Art of Fighting  King is a skilled fighter who earned fame early in her career by defeating a famous Muay Thai champ. For various reasons - such as to hide her true identity, to present herself as a reliable fighter, and other issues with her gender - she made efforts to portray herself as a man to defend herself from the dangers of Southtown. Five years before Art of Fighting takes place, she suffers a humiliating defeat to Jack Turner and his gang. It is unclear of how, but she ends up working for Mr. Big as the (male) bouncer at the L'Amor Restaurant. Her secret is exposed when she is defeated by Ryo Sakazaki, who is searching for his sister Yuri. King agrees to help him save his sister and guides Ryo and Robert to Mr. Big's hideout. In the following game, she tries to make an honest living, but resurfaces on the streets. She enters the King of Fighters tournament with hopes to win the prize money to pay for a surgery her younger brother needs to gain the use of his legs. In her ending, she is surprised to see Jan walking on his own two feet. Both Ryo and Robert paid for the operation as thanks for her help with finding Yuri. According to Ryo, she is still well by the time Buriki One takes place. Running the Illusion bar, Ryo occasionally stops by to see her and catch up. Since he considers her a \"good friend\", their relationship probably isn't on the romantic track.The King of Fighters  Like all of the Art of Fighting characters to appear in King of Fighters, King's history is largely unchanged, but continues in an alternate continuity (Art of Fighting appears to take place in 1978-1979). During the series, King acts as the consistent member of the reoccurring Womens' Team. She also opens up her own bar in England (and later South Town), the \"Illusion\", and hires two waitresses named Sally and Elizabeth to assist her. She generally acquiesces to her teammates' whims as she wants to participate to make Jan proud. She agrees to join the Art of Fighting team in The King of Fighters 2000 when Yuri begs her to be her replacement. When Robert doubts her credibility, King is able to prove her worth in an extensive kicking contest. The series also emphasized her possible infatuation with Ryo, which is heavily hinted at in 2000 and The King of Fighters XI. Although she suggested other candidates for her position, King enters the KOF XIII tournament since she doesn't want to lose to the other teams.Personality  King is a kind, trustworthy, but violent woman. She is unquestionably loyal to her friends, but relentlessly unforgiving towards her enemies. Although King is very passionate, she rarely shows a sensitive side to her friends (and when she does, things just seem to go wrong). She often dresses in men's clothing (although her attire has become more feminine with time) and has a great affinity for fine wine. She also tends to obsess over money so she can pay Jean's medical bills. Though King was once at war with her own sex, she appears to have never been so with her sexuality and seems to be quite attracted to Ryo Sakazaki. (They even have special starting poses to imply this.) Although King acts rather masculine at the best of times, traces of femininity can't help but show themselves every now and then. For her KOF XIII team story, she expresses a desire to a wear a dress for her teams' victory party.Powers Skills Fighting Style  King uses a very distinct Muay Thai. She employs several acrobatic jumping and high kicks which are not used as much by Muay Thai kickboxers. Her fighting style is very much like the Korean style of kickboxing known as Kun Gek Do. Being French, it is more than likely that she employs Savate techniques in her fighting, as well. When King is knocked out with a special move in Art of Fighting, the top of her costume flies off. This continues to happen in Art of Fighting 2, The King of Fighters '94, and The King of Fighters '95 but doesn't happen again until KOF XIII. If this is done during AOF's story mode, King will say different quotes after her defeat. The same occurrence happens again in KOF XIV, only this time, the top layer of the top of her costume flies off, leaving the under layer of said costume unbuttoned.Music Image Song Voice Actors Game Appearances Mobile Appearances Cameo Appearances Anime Appearances See also References Geese Howard  Geese Howard (\u30ae\u30fc\u30b9\u30fb\u30cf\u30ef\u30fc\u30c9, G\u012bsu Haw\u0101do) is the chief antagonist of the Fatal Fury series and a secondary villain in the Art of Fighting series. His role varies in the The King of Fighters storyline, but he is always either in the position of a villain or an anti-hero. Geese also appears in many CD dramas and stars in his own character image album. He also sings in a number of image songs. In addition to appearing in manga adaptations of the Fatal Fury, Art of Fighting and The King of Fighters games published in Japan, Geese Howard was also the subject of a single-volume manga published in 1996 titled The Geese Howard Story by Etsuya Amajishi, adapting the character's fictional history from the Art of Fighting and Fatal Fury games. It was followed by a single-volume sequel in 1997 titled Geese in the Dark, by the same author. In the Neo Geo Freak's 1997 Volume 8 character poll, he was voted as the nineteenth favourite character with a total of 507 votes. 232 votes from the male fans and 275 votes from the female fans. In the character popularity poll on Neo Geo Freak's website, he was voted as the thirteenth favorite character with a total of 903 votes.History  The fate of Geese Howard is one of the major differences between the continuities. In the Fatal Fury series, he is dead. In The King of Fighters series, however, he is alive (excluding the KOF: Maximum Impact series). He is sometimes known for using his \"Nightmare\" mode for games where he is dead, such as in Real Bout Fatal Fury Special.Pre-Art of Fighting  Geese comes from a poor American woman and an Austrian terrorist. His father abandoned them after Geese was born in Southtown. Working for both of their sakes to surpass his father, he took up odd jobs around the city. Despite his efforts, his mother eventually died from poor health and hunger. Rather than dwelling in sadness, Geese tracks down his father in Europe and learns his father's real name is Rudolph Krauser Von Stroheim. He tries to assassinate him when he was 15 but fails due to his half-brother, Wolfgang Krauser, effortlessly stopping him (this same scene is later re-enacted in The Fatal Fury 2 anime). He tried to rid of his anger through religion but couldn't shake the humiliation of his loss. Learning at a young age that power grants results, Geese trained in the school of Hakkyokuseiken with Jeff Bogard and Cheng Sinzan, under Tung Fu Rue's tutelage. Other games imply that Geese had also studied with other martial arts teachers, including the grandfather of \"Blue\" Mary Ryan and Toji Sakata - mainly Japanese martial arts styles. During this time of their prime, the three were once renowned as the \"Three Brothers of Godly Battle\". However, at the same time, he also started to build his network with the Southtown local mafia through intimidation and personal bribes. This is where he also gained the services of Ripper and Hopper. Sensing that Geese would not use the sacred techniques of the school selflessly, Tung passes the secrets of the school to Jeff. He had hoped to tame Geese's spirit afterward but he departed from the place enraged, and saw the end of the school's relations with him. He focuses his efforts in overthrowing a kingpin named Mr. Big and he eventually becomes the reigning crime lord of Southtown. To separate his business with his mafia and to find a place to properly train, he also commissioned the building of his own headquarters, Geese Tower. As time passed, he also used the tower as one of the main operating stations for his own business, Howard Connection.Art of Fighting 2  Art of Fighting 2 reveals that it is Geese who orders Mr. Big to kidnap Yuri Sakazaki in the original Art of Fighting game. Yuri is kidnapped to keep in line Mr. Karate (Takuma Sakazaki), who is being forced to work for Geese - the SNES version of AoF states his orders included killing Jeff, but this may not be entirely canonical. It is Geese who orders Mr. Karate to fight his son, Ryo Sakazaki. Although he was powerful, Geese had still not completely conquered Southtown yet. Hoping to gain more men for his cause, he hosts the first known King of Fighters tournament. Unfortunately, he came out of the event empty-handed and was defeated by Ryo. He was able to escape and successfully defended his turf from the jealous Mr. Big.Fatal Fury series  In 1981, Geese Howard kills Jeff Bogard in front of his son Terry's eyes (revealed in Fatal Fury: Wild Ambition) and hires Billy Kane as his personal bodyguard. He sets up Billy as his champion in his King of Fighters tournaments. Ten years after Jeff's death, Terry, his brother Andy Bogard, and their friend Joe Higashi enter Geese's King of Fighters tournament. Terry faces him on top of Geese Tower and defeats him by knocking him out the window. While the town presumes him to be dead, Geese was actually alive, apparently thanks to the secrets of a Chinese scroll in his possession. The scroll, called the \"Phoenix Scroll\", was later discovered in Geese Tower; it allows the user to speed up their recovery rate. During Fatal Fury Special,\u00a0Geese hears that the scrolls grant immortality, so he discreetly searches for them. The story in Real Bout Fatal Fury explains that Geese obtained all three scrolls from Jin Chonshu and Jin Chonrei. However, he strategically wants them destroyed so that they would never be used against him. In the same game, he finally announces his presence to the public and organizes another King of Fighters tournament to settle his differences with the Bogard brothers. In the tournament's climax, he faces Terry and is once again thrown from the tower. Although Terry caught hold of his nemesis' hand, Geese refused his help and wrenched his arm away from Terry's grasp, laughing while falling to his own death, for good. Though there was speculation that he survived his second encounter, the story in Garou: Mark of the Wolves depicts that Geese had fatally fell from Geese Tower. The Real Bout series alluded to this fact with his nightmare form that appeared as a difficult secret boss. He is survived in the games by his son Rock Howard.Fatal Fury anime series  Geese's fate in the Fatal Fury anime trilogy differs from that of the game series. After suffering defeat from Terry in the first OVA, his appearances in the later two films are minimal. In Fatal Fury 2: The New Battle, he goes into hiding and is found by Krauser. The long scar across Geese's left eye was made by Krauser during his failed assassination attempt for his father. In the movie, Geese is seen only briefly as Billy Kane informs him of the Bogards' activities.The King of Fighters  The major difference from this series's continuity than others is the fact that Geese is still alive. An interview with Neo Geo Freak reveals that this is mostly due to the fact that The King of Fighters development team wasn't initially aware about Geese's fate in the Real Bout series. Once they heard about it, the developers from Real Bout team approved his appearance in the series due to their desires to create the Boss Team. Additionally, Geese's profile statistics during this series are the same ones for Fatal Fury Special (excluding his age). Having manipulated Mr. Big and Wolfgang Krauser's interests in his activities, Geese enters the 1996 King of Fighters tournament to entertain himself. His goal was to minimize his rivals' power and investigate the things surrounding Orochi's power, as well as to settle the score with Terry. In his team's ending, Billy shields him from an assassination attempt from one of Big's men and the crime lords part ways. Since then, Geese plays a minor role by hiring Billy to investigate oddities in the tournaments. He often plans for Billy's teammates in advance by offering them various personal awards. So far, he has been keeping tabs on Orochi and seems to have taken an interest in Gato's father. Geese was included as a bonus character for the Playstation 2 port of The King of Fighters XI. In it, Geese's win quote after defeating Terry shows him wondering why Terry is so surprised to see him, claiming that he already told him that he's immortal. After many years of his absence from The King of Fighters tournaments, Geese decides to return to participate, together with Billy and Hein, Geese's butler. It's later revealed that Geese has not unlocked the secrets of the Jin scrolls yet, but they prophesied the events within the story (Verse's appearance and warriors thought to be lost coming back to life), which is the reason why he entered the tournament. In the series's alternate universe, KOF: Maximum Impact, Geese is presumed dead once more since the game's setting hardly mentions his presence. However, his \"Nightmare\" form makes an appearance in the sequel. Ureshino alludes that this was done mainly due to Rock and Billy's appearances in the game.Personality  Geese is a proud man who considers himself a mighty warrior and as such thinks highly of himself. He craves power in all of its forms: from money to immortality, a desire influenced by various tragedies in his childhood, from losing his mother to being estranged as a stepson. He can be quite vengeful as well, as he holds grudges against Krauser and Jeff, whom he later killed. Despite appearing to be heartlessly evil however, he has his own code of honor and there are lines that even he will not cross; never underestimating his opponents, especially after suffering defeat from Terry. He will crush anyone who stands in his way and reward those he deems worthy of his respect, or in the case of Billy, whoever he sympathizes with. He appears to show respect to Tung Fu Rue despite their histories, even if he is sometimes sarcastic about it, as seen in Neo Geo Battle Coliseum, and more recently in KOF XIV. He has a fascination with Japan, often adorning the Japanese decorum on the Geese Tower rooftop with American flags, and has assimilated some Nipponese culture as a result. Whether because of ambition or to simply keep them from possible harm, he was apparently distant from his personal family, ignoring Rock's pleas to help Marie in her sickness until she reportedly passed away. As a result, this earned him Rock's indignation and the latter's devotion to stay away from his shadow.Powers Skills Fighting Style  Geese uses Aikijutsu as his primary fighting style. Aikijutsu is a style with several throws, counter throws and locks. However, it is a style that normally lacks striking attacks, and Geese's strikes seem to come from various disciplines of Japanese martial arts, mainly karate; though he also knows traditional and older schools of Japanese martial arts. While Geese is from the USA, his extensive practice of such martial arts has lead nearly all of his techniques to be written and spoken out in Japanese. Via his codifying 2/3-way counter throws, some games may or may not allow Geese to even reverse physical supers/DM's. Many official sources state that his fighting style is Hakkyokuseiken, but this is disputed. It can be assumed that Hakkyokuseiken only teaches the way of the chi and not fighting techniques, as Terry Bogard, Tung Fu Rue and Geese Howard, students of this school, employ different fighting styles. Through his chi control, many of Geese's attacks possess a wind-based motif, mainly through techniques such as the Reppuuken (Gale Fist), Shippuuken (Hurricane Fist) and Raging Storm; as he develops his style, he also adds some electricity-based touches, such as his popular Raimei Gouha Nage (Thunderclap Strong Crushing Throw), and the stronger version of his Raging Storm, the Thunder Break. KOF '96 was also the game that debuted the alternate \"wind slashing\" variation of his Reppuuken, which also converts his Shippuuken to turn into a short range energy shot instead that negates projectiles. His Double Reppuuken was also unique in that via Geese tossing out an energy mass prior to form a bigger projectile afterward, it would vary between games if the said energy mass would dissipate or not upon contact with either the opponent or another projectile (if so, it would cause Geese to toss a normal Reppuuken instead of the bigger one). Another one of his inconsistencies his is one of his many unique throw attacks, the Shinkuu Nage (Vacuum Throw); a unique technique he Geese tosses his opponent overhead then waves his arms while ending in a focused stance. In some games, it is a normal throw, while in others, it is a command throw instead; either way, its command has often varied, and ironically Geese's son has found more use for his version of it due to his ability to break it. His younger-self however, has used an old technique named the Explosion Ball, and also favored a more rigid boxing style mixed with karate. However, as he ages to his more popular present-self, he employs many new attacks and has a more upright stance that allows him to focus on his reversals and various throws. Though in tribute to his younger-self, one technique present-Geese has retained in some titles from Art of Fighting 2 is his Hishou Nichirin Zan (Flying Day Ring Slash). His Rashoumon (Thin Life Gate) technique which debuted in Real Bout Fatal Fury 2 also references the castle gate location of the same name. The command input of Geese's Raging Storm has remained mostly untouched in his game appearances due to its popularity with fans in Japan (coined the \"Pretzel Command\" by the fandom). It is one of the few moves from Fatal Fury to not undergo a command rearrangement in The King of Fighters series. In some games, such as Neo Geo Battle Coliseum, SVC Chaos, and KOF '98 UM, the command input is lax thus gamers can find a way to execute it with a simpler command that overlaps. Regarding its name, many different sources have romanized it as Raising Storm, Raging Storm or Rising Storm (the second naming variation which his son stays consistent with). However, its command so far has been notably the most strict in The King of Fighters Neowave via his younger self, in that messing up the input may have him activate Deadly Rave instead. Though prior to that via, Real Bout Fatal Fury 2, its command input instead was that of the Haou Shoukou Ken (while still fairly tight); in The King of Fighters XIV, its motion instead changes to that of the Ura 108 Shiki: Orochinagi (a quarter-circle backward-to-half-circle forward) motion and is instead his only strongest move via acting as his Climax DM (with the removal of the Deadly Rave), which simplifies his character somewhat and also resembles the \"windy\" version his son uses. Geese's CD attack while it had a name in more in-depth movelists in the Japanese scripts (known as the Fudou Kassatsu Uraken, lit. Motionless Life-or-Death Backfist), was one of the few along with some others had that its name brought to light as a command normal in the vs. Capcom crossovers. However, via his ripped SvC Chaos incarnation that appears in the console versions of 2002, his default CD/Blowback Attack (along with Goenitz, Shingo and King's) inflicts no damage via a programming error, while the aforementioned command normal version of it does. His Deadly Rave technique was created via Geese taking interest of the Kyokugen style's Ryuuko Ranbu technique, in games barring Art of Fighting 2, The King of Fighters '98 Ultimate Match and The King of Fighters Neowave where the DM was an automatic super, the DM was also famous for having a special sequenced command that could lead into finisher (a series of weaker-to-stronger normal attack inputs followed by a quarter-circle-back finishing input), but also required consistent timing and rhythm (which could be purposely dropped at the very end to extend combos). Via Daisuke Ishiwatari's departure from SNK to Arc System Works and when referenced in The Last Blade beforehand, a number of other video game titles have referenced this very attack's unique input sequence. While Geese has been balanced in terms of gameplay in many titles barring ones where he is intentionally overpowered, his younger version in Neowave was viable even in competitive play, despite some attributes being hard to counter such as his Deadly Rave having a notable amount of invincibility with a great hitbox; Geese even in his debut was rather considered to be a notably powerful boss in SNK titles, as his counter throws even worked when no incoming attacks triggered it. Younger Geese in Neowave also lacked a properly-programmed HSDM/MAX2DM. Ironically via Real Bout 2, Geese was notably toned down, with almost half of his classic moveset being removed along with a few new moves added. This version of him combined with his \"Nightmare\" version was brought back in a more balanced composite version in '98 Ultimate Match. His SvC Chaos incarnation which was reused for the later ports of KOF 2002 also had touches from his Nightmare-self as well, despite being his normal self that is still alive. In Neo Geo Battle Coliseum, a unique form of his Raging Storm is used as a stronger version whenever he manages to land one of his counter throws. This is a reference to this very version of the said move when used in Fatal Fury 3, where his Raging Storm will turn red during a unique combination of attacks and deal more damage. In KOF XIV, Geese instead is slightly reworked with some of his attacks removed once more, along with having new moves up his arsenal; his Ja'ei Ken (Wicked Shadow Fist) being removed and gaining a command throw mainly exclusive to Nightmare Geese. In prior games, Geese was lacking in offensive mixup; this is remedied with his new Fudou Ken (Motionless Fist), a move where Geese rushes forward with a palm strike (and was originally a command normal with auto-guard in the Maximum Impact series) with three followups, A (Flatter), Ba (Name) and Un (Growl), which respectively hit mid, low and overhead (but don't act as a true combo outside of counter hit/juggle hit for the latter two). Other new techniques in XIV are the DM's Raigou Reppuuken (Thunder Booming Gale Fist), a lightning-laced variant of his signature projectile, and the Oni Hanmon (Ogre Agony), a brand new DM counter throw that will still waste a stock if not triggered properly; if triggered, Geese will thrust his palm into the opponent then smash their face in to the ground.Music Voice Actors Live Action Actors Game Appearances Mobile Appearances Cameo Appearances Anime Appearances Similar Characters See also Trivia References The King of Fighters XII  The King of Fighters XII (\u30b6\u30fb\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u30fb\u30aa\u30d6\u30fb\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u30ba\u3000\u30c8\u30a5\u30a8\u30eb\u30d6; Za Kingu obu Fait\u0101zu T\u016berubu; KOF XII) is the twelfth installment in the King of Fighters series. SNK Playmore has announced that it is abandoning the Atomiswave system and is moving its most popular game franchises to the Taito Type X2 arcade system. In addition to KOF XII, KOF Maximum Impact: Regulation A and a new Samurai Shodown game in 3D were released on the new arcade system. KOF XII has no story and the Ash Saga concludes in The King of Fighters XIII. The main illustrations were done by Eisuke Ogura.Development  The game underwent a complete graphical overhaul, confirmed by Nona, artist in charge of the art in the The King of Fighters XI endings. All the sprites used in previous games for over 10 years were to be dropped and replaced with new high definition sprites. The programmers have stated their intention was to create the \"ultimate 2D fighting game\". Nona reaffirmed this once again in The King of Fighters Year End Party 2006 in Tokyo. SNK Overseas Manager Yoshihito Koyama revealed that the game was going to be \"3D mixed with 2D\"; this led to speculation that the game could use cel-shading to give the game a 2D look, but it was later revealed at AOU 2008 that KOF XII would use newly-drawn 2D sprites on detailed 2D backgrounds. Producer Masaaki Kukino informed Kotaku that the game is one hundred percent hand drawn, there being zero cell shading in the game. He has also stated that the main goal of the game is to give a new \"rebirth\" to the series. They have no intention of changing the main series into 3D in the future. The staff decided to create the new graphics during 2005 and 2006, and commented that they spent triple the amount of time developing it than the previous game. In an interview with Fighters Front Line, Kukino replies that each character took 16~17 months to complete with a team of 10 different designers. Additionally, the sprites were personally checked by Nona for quality. Due to the time demands of drawing such detailed frames of animation, as well as the decision not to incorporate older assets as previous games in the series have, there are only 20 playable characters, the lowest number ever in a game from this series. An interview with Kukino revealed that there would be console exclusive characters. On February 14, 2008, the first gameplay footage was revealed to the world showcasing the new, much larger, higher-resolution pixel art sprites at the Arcade Operators Union Amusement Expo (AOU) 2008. The footage also revealed the presences of Benimaru Nikaido, Terry Bogard (reverting to his original Fatal Fury outfit), Athena Asamiya and Kim Kaphwan in KOF XII. A location test was scheduled in Japan for April 18-20, 2008, but was canceled for unknown reasons. Kukino later stated in an interview this was done because the staff felt they should show a more polished product than the beta they had at the time. There was also a recruiting ad for part-time positions on SNK's Japanese website, asking particularly for a game graphic designer with experience in animation and color design. A playable demo was available to the public at the 46th AOU on September 18, 2008 and the 2008 Tokyo Game Show on October 9, 2008. The January location test featured a new visual layout unlike those seen in the past. Macha Yusa stated that the last location test would take place on February 27~March 4 this year. However, news of another location test popped up for March 6~8.Game Mechanics  KOF XII uses the usual 3-on-3 team system with each fight consisting of 5 rounds. The Tactical Shift System from The King of Fighters 2003 has been removed. Since there is no story for this installment, there are no default teams or team endings in the roster, so players are free to make whatever teams they desire. The game returned to its standard four button layout. Players can still dash, backstep, and perform rolls as their evade. Recovery rolls can be done with any button and throws are now performed by holding a direction and tapping A+C when close. The C+D attacks are still present but the Guard Breaks from previous games (pressing C+D while blocking with a block of super energy) can now be done at any time. Super special moves will now be executed in real-time and in a similar manner as The King of Fighters '94, meaning that there's a single level superbar that gradually drains once it is maxed. The newest addition to the game system are \"Critical Counters\". When the Super Gauge is at its Maximum stage, the player can time their attack to clash with their opponent's blow and leave them open for a devastating attack. After a successful counter, the player with the advantage can dash, combo, and even perform a special finisher attack with their character's desperation move. The time frame for this effect lasts as long as the green colored ripple from the clash is on screen; once it dissipates, the damage boost from the Critical Counter will end. Counters can be done on the ground or while airbone. The clashes of Critical Counters will only occur when strong attacks (or certain moves performed with strong attacks) connect simultaneously. Each stage has two types of themes played for it. Depending on the stage, the themes can work with the depicted stage ambiance or play a standard musical riff. The music staff from the previous title were in charge of overseeing the production but were not the ones conducting the music. As a side note, the music played during the trailer is included as a track in the game.Console Exclusive Characters Related Media  To promote the game, SNK announced a cellphone series called KOFXII Tokusetsu Corner for the Yahoo and imode Japanese networks on August 1, 2008. Each volume features an original story and bio information for three characters that will be in the game's lineup (revealed to be Ash, Kyo, and Terry). The style that these are presented in is similar to the in-game profiles of KOF: Maximum Impact 2. These novelizations were later added to the character profiles on the official website. On April 23, the series also had a collaboration event with the Japanese artsite, pixiv. For people who have a pivix account, the entries can be seen here.Stages External Links Trivia The King of Fighters XI  The King of Fighters XI (KOF XI) is the eleventh installment of The King of Fighters series. This game continues the \"Tales of Ash\" Saga, started in The King of Fighters 2003. Its tentative title was The King of Fighters 2004 though this name was debunked by the end of 2004. The numerical distinction for the series is based primarily on SNK Playmore wanting to avoid being locked into a rigorous yearly schedule of releases.Storyline  Mukai, a member of a mysterious group, stole the Orochi seal in the last tournament and broke it, causing confusion and destruction to happen from within sight. Taking advantage of the situation at hand, Ash stole the Yata Mirror from Chizuru and drained her powers in the process. In the advent of a new KOF tournament, new faces are handed invitations, while old faces, such as Eiji Kisaragi, return to the ring. Among the new KOF participants are Oswald, Duck King (a South Town veteran fighter himself), Momoko, and Elisabeth. All these fighters will find themselves in a tournament full of mysteries and secrets started by motives that they\u2019d ignored. Behind this healthy competitive tournament hides a hidden force called \"People from the Past\" with a mysterious goal.Game Mechanics  Aside from the already known gameplay maneuvers that add much depth to the gameplay, Runs, Rolls, Short Jumps, Guard Cancel CDs and Rolls, Empty Cancels, and the returning Quick Emergency Roll, the four largest innovations KOF XI brings to the franchise are the Quick Shift, the Saving Shift, the Skill Gauge and the Dream Cancel. The Skill Stocks significantly complicate the gameplay of KOF. The Power Stocks that existed previously are still present, and are filled in the usual fashion. Nevertheless, there are now Skill Stocks as well, which gradually build up over time. Each team begins a match holding the maximum of two Skill Stocks. Offensive maneuvers, such as Desperation Moves, Guard Cancels, and Tag Attacks, continue to use Power Stocks. However, more defensive or tactical maneuvers, such as Guard Evasion, Saving Shift, and Quick Shift, use Skill Stocks. KOF XI utilizes the Tactical Shift System from KOF 2003, but makes very important changes. The Quick Shift allows you to change into another character in the middle of any combo, prolonging it, or in the middle of any attack, no matter if it was blocked or not, canceling the frames of animation of the attack, if it's needed. The Saving Shift allows the player to take out a character when he is being hit as soon as he is hit, or in any moment, at the cost of both skill bars. This effectively cuts many combos that otherwise would do a lot of damage, eliminates the possibility of infinities by repeating chains of attacks on the ground (excluding aerial juggles) and brings an element of balance to the game. While it is possible to escape from any combination of attacks on the ground, it is not possible to use Saving Shift to get out from a Desperation or Leader Desperation move. The last new feature of KOF XI is the Dream Cancel. Like the Super Cancel that first appeared in KOF '99, Dream Cancel allows players to use stocks to interrupt a move in the midst of its execution with a more powerful move, allowing devastating combos; however, the Dream Cancel is more deadly than ever, allowing a DM to be canceled into an LDM, at the expensive price of two Power Stocks and one Skill Stock. Should the timer run down in a match, the winner is no longer decided based upon who has the most life remaining. Instead, the judgment bar, a new bar of circular shape composed of two colors, each one representing one player (red or blue, which are the colors displayed in the portraits of the characters of each side) acts as a quantifier of the skill of each player. Whichever player has the judgment bar towards his side will be the victor if none of the teams win defeating all three characters from the opposite team; rarely, if the bar is exactly in the center, the match will end in a draw and both sides will lose. The bar is affected by each attack that the players get in, combos affect progressively more, and when a character of the opposing team is defeated, the bar suffers a big change against that player. This makes taking care of keeping one's characters alive pretty important, giving strategy to the tags system.Characters Hero Team Rivals Team Fatal Fury Team Art of Fighting Team Ikari Warriors Team Psycho Soldier Team Mark of the Wolves Team Agents Team Anti-Kyokugenryu Team K' Team Kusanagi-Yagami Team Mid-Bosses Bosses Sub-Boss Boss PlayStation 2 Exclusive Hidden Characters PS2 Special Edit Teams Unrequited Love (?)

His name is frequently written in katakana; earlier games used to write his name in kanji (\u5742\u5d0e \u4eae, Sakazaki Ry\u014d). In Gamest's 1997 Heroes Collection, Ryo was voted as the staff's twenty-fourth favorite character. He shared the spot with Sie Kensou and Toru Kurosawa, a character from Sega's Last Bronx. In the Neo Geo Freak's 1997 Volume 8 character poll, he was voted as the seventeenth favourite character with a total of 602 votes. And In a 2005 poll made by SNK-Playmore USA, he was voted as the fifth fan favorite character with a total of 193 votes. Both Nobuyuki Kuroki and Youichiro Soeda have Ryo is their favorite character from the Art of Fighting series.Development  In an interview Takashi Nishiyama states that Ryo was created as a homage to Ryu from Street Fighter.  Artist Shinkiro has expressed he had no problems with designing Ryo in contrast to Robert Garcia due to Ryo's poor state.  SNK staff members Youichiro Soeda said that Ryo and Robert's debut was unique to other games based on the company because it did not focus on fighting tournaments but instead of the duo's quest to save Yuri Sakazaki.Story  Ryo is the son of Takuma Sakazaki and Ronnet Sakazaki and the older brother of Yuri Sakazaki. As Ryo was deemed to be Takuma's successor, he began his martial arts training at an early age. His father instilled him with the difficult principle of self-reliance, where a person's own strength can form their worth in the world. He eventually gained a sparring partner and friend when Robert Garcia was admitted into the dojo. On Ryo's 10th birthday, his mother died in a tragic car accident. His father left their home and left Ryo to take care of Yuri. Ryo did this by partaking in construction work and tirelessly strived to defend his family's dojo. Remembering his father's lessons during his training, he also took up street fighting. At first, he did poorly but, after many years of persistence, he eventually established himself as a fearsome and renowned fighter.Art of Fighting  In the first Art of Fighting, Yuri is kidnapped by Mr. Big, a local criminal mastermind of the dangerous city, Southtown on behalf of Geese Howard. During his journey, he met a bouncer named King, who guides them to Mr. Big's location. With Robert and King's help, Ryo confronts and defeats the kingpin. His pursuit for Mr. Big leads him to a karate dojo where a mysterious man challenges him. When Ryo prevailed, he threatens to finish Mr. Karate unless he told them information about Yuri's safety. Before he deals the final blow, Yuri reveals the man's identity as their father. After eleven years of separation, the whole family is reunited. Before the events of the second game, Ryo went to the mountains for training. He received an invite for a King of Fighters tournament and accepted it to test his strength. When he reaches the finals, the tournament's host, Geese Howard, expresses his desires to recruit Ryo into his services. Ryo refuses and subsequently fight him atop his office in Geese Tower, and defeats him with tremendous effort. Unfortunately, Geese manages to escape and later enacts the beginning of the Fatal Fury story. Ryo's role in the following game is reduced to being a supporting character for Robert. In his ending for the game, he hands his sister a ticket for Robert's flight back home and wishes the best for both of them. Additionally, he gains two new rivals: Kasumi Todoh and Jin Fu-Ha. Presumably, after the Art of Fighting series ended, Takuma retired from fighting and entrusts the Kyokugenryu dojos to Ryo. At least two dojos are in operation, one near Southtown and one is later entrusted to Ryo's student, Marco Rodriguez. This is supported by the fact that Ryo takes over the Mr. Karate mantle that his father once held in Fatal Fury: Wild Ambition and Buriki One.The King of Fighters  The appearance of Ryo in Fatal Fury Special as a secret final boss was perhaps inspiration to SNK's most notable fighting game series, The King of Fighters. Indeed, much of the appeal of the first KOF game, The King of Fighters '94, was that characters from Art of Fighting and Fatal Fury could fight alongside and against each other. Many details were originally retconned to allow the characters of Art of Fighting and Fatal Fury look around the same age though it's currently accepted that the KOF timeline is separate from their respective series. Although both protagonists would only play supporting roles in the series, Ryo and Terry share a friendly rivalry with one another. This is sometimes implied through special intros, official art, and game openings in select KOF titles. Throughout the series, the Kyokugen style is depicted as a struggling family business, funded almost entirely by prize money earned from KOF and Robert's vast wealth. Each year, at the conclusion of KOF, the Kyokugen dojo would often have many applicants due to the strong performance of the team. Despite their hard fought success, most of these applicants would later quit, due to either the strenuous training regime or mysterious people who appear and trash the dojo. The family manages to keep two gyms running, one in South Town and a second in Mexico. Ryo usually teams up with Robert, Yuri, or Takuma to continue spreading the fame of the Kyokugen style. He usually tries his best to keep his sister away from the tournaments and relents to his father's demands. In The King of Fighters 2000, he welcomed King into the team, even through his best friend's protests. Takuma apparently noticed (and somewhat mistook) the respect the young fighters had for one another and presses his wishes for her to join whenever the time calls for it. In The King of Fighters XI, Ryo indicates that Marco is currently a green belt. By the time of The King of Fighters XIV, the Sakazaki family has opened a Kyokugen BBQ restaurant with the help of Richard Meyer. Ryo, displeasing with his family attitude regarding their training, is determined to leave South Town and is accompanied by his student, Khushnood Butt.Personality  Ryo is very serious about fighting and loyal to his friends and family. He has been given discipline through his Karate training by his father, Takuma. He treats Robert as his rival, but they are best friends. He is a little old fashioned and blunt, which sometimes alienates him from his trendier sister and stylish rival. He's also admits to not being very smart\u00a0or talented but he believes that these are obstacles for him to overcome. Compared to Yuri and Robert's ideology on training, Ryo believes he can attain greatness in his art through hard work and experience. Having raised both himself and Yuri during their childhood, he struggles with his own wishes to protect his sister and his own wishes to see her grow up. He accepts her growing maturity with bittersweet acquiescence. It has been implied that there is some romantic tension between him and King. He apparently thinks her to be a good friend though she may think more of him since he contributed to her brother's recovery in Art of Fighting 2. Their relationship is referred to various times during The King of Fighters series. In King of Fighters XIII's story mode, Yuri specifically mentions Ryo and King dating.Powers Fighting Style  Ryo was taught to be the \"tiger\" of Kyokugenryu Karate, ironic since his nickname calls him the dragon. In Buriki One, he seems to use ordinary Karate. His main strength relies on his fierce punching attacks, which is closer to his father's style. His (in)famous Tenchi Haou Ken (Heaven & Earth Supreme Sparkle Fist) is a good result of this type of style as such a punch often was able to automatically put opponents in stun upon impact, despite the low damage it did compared to other DM's (KOF XIII amps this up with a stronger version of this technique as his Neo Max). His Art of Fighting and KOF incarnations tend to differ from one another such as his fighting stance. His Kohou (Tiger Roar) often either faces towards the screen (KOF) or the background (Art of Fighting). In KOF '96 onwards, his signature Ko'ou Ken (Tiger Sparkle Fist) turned into a close range attack afterwards though his Capcom crossovers beg to differ. Ryo during the NESTS Saga adds defensive touches to his style. His Joudan and Gedan Uke (High-Level and Low-Level Reception) parrying command normals enable him to shave off attacks and press the offensive as Ryo is able to cancel into attacks should he block via this method. Both of these types of parries are based on traditional types of basic blocking seen in most martial arts dojos. His Joudan Uke however, has varied in terms of animation, ranging from a rushing cover block or an outward single arm block depending on the game; and in KOF XIII, his Gedan Uke also gets a change in animation.Music Voice Actors Live Action Actors Game Appearances Mobile Appearances Cameo Appearances Anime Appearances Similar Characters See also Trivia References Blue Mary  Blue Mary (\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u30fb\u30de\u30ea\u30fc), whose real name is Mary Ryan (\u30de\u30ea\u30fc\u30fb\u30e9\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3), is a character from both the Fatal Fury and King of Fighters series of fighting games. Blue Mary's first appearance was in Fatal Fury 3: Road to the Final Victory as a private detective. According to Neo Geo Freak, she is modeled after Android 18 from the Dragon Ball series. Her official nickname is Woman in S class (S\u30af\u30e9\u30b9\u306e\u5973, Esukurasu no on'na).

And In the character popularity poll on Neo Geo Freak's website, she was voted as the fifteenth favourite character with a total of 857 votes.History Fatal Fury  Her former lover, Butch, and her father had worked together as fellow colleagues in the secret service. While on a mission protecting the president, they were both shot and killed by terrorists. Devastated by the loss, it is said she has never smiled again since the incident. The leather jacket she wears is a keepsake given to her as a gift from Butch. Having been taught by her former lover how to fight, she becomes a freelancer. Throughout the series, she takes on various odd jobs to investigate mysterious cases. During this time, she meets Terry and the two become good friends.The King of Fighters  In this series, her work was far from over. One day, a mysterious benefactor requested her services to enter the King of Fighters tournament, along with Billy Kane and Ryuji Yamazaki. During the outcome of the tournament, it was discovered that Yamazaki had become more and more insane due to the Orochi blood coursing through his veins and that Billy was sent by Geese to keep an eye on him in order to learn the secret of the Orochi power. However, during a moment of confusion, Yamazaki escaped and Mary was left to ponder on Geese's motives and the root of the situation. Following its conclusion, Terry Bogard informs her of the NESTS cartel and their actions occurring in Southtown. With a new goal in mind to stop the organization, Mary joins the Women's Team along with King, Kasumi Todoh, and Li Xiangfei, and the \"Lonely Wolves\" in 2000 and 2001 to assist in stopping NESTS in the following tournaments, eventually leading to its demise. In 2003, she joins the tournament to investigate the movements of Those from the Past and teams up with former teammate King, as well as another Fatal Fury Team alumna Mai Shiranui. In KOF XI, Mary teamed up with Vanessa and Ramon to continue her case.Personality  Blue Mary is very friendly towards everyone, but she knows (or thinks) that her job must come first before everything else. Mary developed a strong bond with Terry, they seem to have a genuine care and fondness with each other.Powers Skills Fighting Style  Blue Mary employs the fighting art of Combat\u00a0Sambo. This Martial art uses striking and grappling techniques. Some moves resemble those found in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.Music Voice Actors Image Songs Game Appearances Mobile Appearances Cameo Appearances Anime Appearances Similar Characters See also Trivia References Samurai Shodown VI  Samurai Shodown VI (\u30b5\u30e0\u30e9\u30a4\u30b9\u30d4\u30ea\u30c3\u30c4\u5929\u4e0b\u4e00\u5263\u5ba2\u4f1d, Samurai Supirittsu Tenkaichi Kenkakuden, Tale of the World's Greatest Swordsmen), is the tenth iteration in the Samurai Shodown series of fighting games. This game features all characters from the 2D games and is a dream match installment. The game's storyline is a standalone parallel world based on the events of Samurai Shodown V and previous games in the series (ie: Gaira is bald, Genan has his children from his second ending). The producer gives it the nickname \"festival game\". Set in an unknown year, Yoshitora makes a proclamation to decide the strongest fighter in the world. Each battle takes place at various festivals from countries all over the world. Every stage represents a different festival or holiday, for example Halloween in Ireland, or the Lunar New Years in China.Overview  Samurai Shodown VI is the next installment to the Samurai Shodown series after Samurai Shodown V Special. The game features new backgrounds with 2D and 3D elements, as well as a returning cast of all 28 characters from Samurai Shodown V Special, as well as all 7 characters from Samurai Shodown and Samurai Shodown II that didn't appear in later games, and 4 new characters. It also features a \"spirit select\" system, which allows players to choose between six different fighting styles based on all previous installments. Despite normal Samurai Shodown releases and distribution outside of Japan, the game has been released outside of the country on the Atomiswave system sponsored in the United States by Sega but had limited distribution. The game was released for the Playstation 2 in Japan on January 25th, 2006. The PS2 release added even more playable characters, and three more spirit select systems to go along with them. With the PS2 release, virtually every character to have ever appeared in the 2D Neo Geo games, including the referee, Kuroko, and the animal characters, are all playable. The sole exception is the courier man Hikyaku. Due to the controversy surrounding the graphic nature of its predecessor and Sega sponsorship, the violence is toned down. The ability to perform fatalities is removed from the game, and blood effects are replaced with fireworks. In addition, more controversy came about with the fact that all of the voice actors were replaced with new ones, causing massive fan outcry. The character Iroha was well-received by fans in Japan and stars in several mobile games.Character Roster Returning from Samurai Shodown I & II Newcomers Mascots Alternative Versions External Links ", "Sonic Wiki": "Sonic Wiki ", "Sonny Wiki": "Sonny Wiki Sonny 2  Sonny 2 is the sequel to the popular flash game Sonny, and continues the storyline where Sonny left off. It, like Sonny, was made by Krin and published through Armor Games. It was first released on December 19, 2008. The game has seven zones; five story zones and two bonus zones. The bonus zones can only be accessed on Challenging difficulty or higher, and Zone 7, Sho'Tul Shelf, can only be accessed if the Legend achievement has been completed. Sonny 2 is set in the same universe as Sonny, a world with a vast array of technology and mental disciplines. Characters use a variety of clubs, swords, rifles, staffs, magic, and more in combat, as well as utilizing a great number of specialized physical and mental attacks. Much of the world seems to be overrun with zombies, which is probably the reason that the ZPCI (Zombie Pest Control Incorporated) was formed. The ZPCI are the main antagonists of the series; they will stop at nothing to remain in business, killing everyone involved in any research designed to find a cure for zombification. Sonny frequently runs into ZPCI soldiers, as they attempt to kill him on sight (due to the fact that he is a zombie). The ZPCI have a potent presence in many places, particularly in large cities such as Hew.Gameplay Single-player  Sonny 2 is primarily a single-player RPG, and is very similar to the first Sonny game. Gameplay is divided into three main interfaces: 1. The World Map, which shows all discovered locations (see Zones). From this screen the player can travel to zones that they have been to before. 2. The Roaming-Mode screen, in which the player can prepare for their next battle by organizing their inventory, their equipment, their skills (see Attributes and Abilities), saving the game, and visiting shops. This is the main screen, and players can engage in training battles, or primary battles to move further into the zone. 3. The Battle screen, where the player's team fights turn-based battles against the opposing team. On the player's turn, they may only control their own character (Sonny) directly by selecting abilities to use on a particular target of choice.Abilities  Sonny gains experience along with party members after every fight. Sonny levels up after gaining sufficient experience. Every level-up grants Sonny Ability Points and Attribute Points, which can be used to activate upgrades. Ability Points are used to unlock or improve Abilities, which are based on Sonny's class (see Classes). Abilities are used for powerful attacks, healing, or to temporarily improve/reduce a character's Attributes. Unlike Sonny 1, in Sonny 2 the ability tree is different for each class (Psychological, Biological or Hydraulic). Players have a wide range of different Abilities to unlock, that enable the creation of different \"builds\". For example, the Hydraulic class contains abilities for a \"Hot Hydraulic\" build, which focuses on attack, and a \"Cold Hydraulic\" build which focuses on defense. Attribute Points are used to improve Sonny's 4 basic Attributes, consisting of Vitality, Strength, Instinct and Speed. The fifth Attribute, Focus, cannot be improved with Attribute Points. The importance of attributes various depending on Sonny's class. Sonny also has a range of Piercing and Defense attributes, such as Lighting, Fire, Ice, and so on. Some special equipment contain bonuses for such attributes, that improves attacks of that type. Sonny can wear/wield different kinds of equipment. Before a fight, players can modify the equipment configuration, or visit the Zone Shop to trade equipment. Also, certain enemies drop rare equipment that cannot be purchased at shops. Before a fight, players can select a ring of 8 Abilities (the \"Combat Action Bar\") that can be used during a fight. Certain powerful abilities can be added twice to the ring, allowing for usage in successive turns. During a fight, the player can only control Sonny directly. The player can choose an enemy to attack, as well as an ability from the ring to attack/defend with. Certain abilities affect Sonny and party members (such as healing abilities) and certain can only be used on enemies (defensive and offensive abilities).Multi-player  Sonny 2, unlike Sonny, includes the PVP feature. It is possible to export characters from separate or similar clients and then import them into the one game in order for them to battle each other, controlled by the players. There is no time limit for turns, regardless of whether either of the teams play in heroic mode normally. However, it is evident that the game was not designed with PVP in mind, as the various character classes are highly imbalanced when it comes to PVP. It is possible for a Biological speed character, for example, to equip a certain combination of abilities that allows him to start an unpreventable one-shot-kill setup on any of the opposing team's members as soon as the match begins. Second to this character in terms of overpoweredness is the cold Hydraulic character, which can prevent the opposing team's \"Sonny\" from acting half the time, and from using focus the rest of the time, making most opposing characters next to useless.Classes  The following is a list of the classes for Sonny. Players can only select a class at the beginning of the game. Click on a class to learn more about the Abilities it offers.Psychological  Main article: Psychological Players that use the Psychological classes use abilities that deal either lightning or shadow damage, using instinct as almost their only co-efficient (only three shadow abilities are based on strength, namely corruption, nerve shock and dark infusion).Biological  Main article: Biological The Biological class focuses on mainly offensive physical and poison attacks to deal damage, and therefore its main co-efficients are strength and speed. Defensive capabilities are supportive and focus on keeping the team alive. This class is neutral for both offensive and defensive.Hydraulic  Main article: Hydraulic The Hydraulic class provides extensive diversity, allowing for much greater flexibility than the other two classes. The two main trees within the class are the hot and cold trees. Hot Hydraulic abilities are designed to maximize damage output using strength as the only co-efficient, while cold abilities tend to focus more on defensive and disabling abilities. Unlike other two classes, this class is exclusive to the game client in Armor Games.Plot  Sonny 2 starts with a cutscene showing Sonny waking suddenly from a dream. It has been a month since the events of Sonny. He and Veradux are camping around a fire, and start to discuss the tape given to Sonny by Louis the Blind in the previous game. Though they have traveled a long way, Sonny still has not found a way to play the tape. Soon, a mysterious zombie named Felicity arrives on a motorcycle, snatches the tape from Sonny and stabs Veradux in the face. Sonny and Veradux chase her to New Alcatraz prison. They fight off many guards and human experiments, formerly the prisoners. They also re-encounter soldiers from the ZPCI. When the two finally track down Felicity, they find her trying to escape in a car. Veradux shuts down the car's battery with an electro-bolt, and Sonny asks Felicity what's so valuable about the tape. She replies, \"It's the key to... Utopia.\" A battle ensues, and once they have defeated Felicity, she throws them a tape (be it the real one or a replacement) and makes her escape on foot, stabbing Veradux in the face again as she leaves. They play the tape in her car's tape player. Anticlimactically, however, it just plays the song: \"You Are My Sunshine.\" They remember Felicity mentioning a Utopia, and finding a map in the car, start to drive there. The car soon breaks down, however, as Veradux's Electro Bolt had permanently damaged the car's battery. They stop at the village Oberursel, which is covered in snow and ice. Within the village there are two main factions:a cult that practices human sacrifice and a group of insurgents. The village is also infested with zombies and other ice monsters. Sonny and Veradux are soon attacked by a couple of insurgents who mistake them for common zombies. However, they soon realize their mistake and one of them, Roald, makes a deal with them. He enlists Sonny's help in overthrowing the cult in the village in return for Roald taking them to the Utopia. Roald joins Sonny and together they fight through zombies, frost monsters and the Knights, Mages and Priests that made up the cult's fighting force. They eventually encounter the Cult Leader, and immediately attack him. However, during the battle, Sonny's head starts to hurt, the same way it did on the Great Plains in the previous game. As the battle draws to a close, the Cult Leader suddenly transforms into his true form, that of Baron Brixius, whom they met and fought in the previous game. The Baron reveals that he started the cult, apparently mostly for fun. it is likely that he had engineered all the conflict within the village, driving the cultists to destroy the insurgents while at the same time controlling the zombies within the area to attack both the insurgents and the cultists. Sonny, Veradux and Roald defeat him for a second time, and the cultists, seeing their master in his true form, are disillusioned and the cult disintegrates. The next cutscene shows several ZPCI helicopters flying in on the village. Gunshots are heard in the background, and the cutscene ends with the screen turning off. Sonny and company are attacked by a ZPCI Elite and two armored hounds. After defeating them, they run into the leader of the operation, Captain Hunt, and his entourage, a sniper and a medic. They kill the sniper and the medic and, leaving Captain Hunt lying wounded on the ground, escape the village by train. As they leave, they hear Hunt ordering his men to follow them. As they escape by train on the Ivory Line, they realize that the train does not have enough fuel to last the whole trip. Therefore they decide to go to the back of the train for more coal. On the way they meet a collector named Ed Spencer, who offers to sell his goods to them, advising them not to go into the other carriages as Clemons the Deceiver had been through there. They go anyway, and are forced to fight through ZPCI, hobos, spectres and other monstrosities to get to the back of the train. In the last carriage, they meet Clemons the Deceiver, a former magician skilled in illusionary magic. He has now, however, gone insane, and proceeds to attack the party. They defeat him, but the train soon crashes in the Tunnel of Illusions due to the fact that no-one was actually driving it. The Tunnel of Illusions, or Labyrinth, is a network of tunnels near the city of Hew. The Ivory Line runs through it to Hew, which Sonny must follow to get there. The tunnels are filled with green slime and a strange form of gas, the nature of which is unknown but causes decreased brain activity, increased levels of dopamine, severe hallucinations and ultimately death. Some sort of substance in the tunnels also seems to cause powerful mutations in some lifeforms, creating a vast array of extremely strange creatures that inhabit the Labyrinth. Sonny, Veradux and Roald fight through many of these creatures until they reach the end of the tunnel. There they encounter another mutation, the Hydra. It is unclear whether it is made up of several different creatures, or if it is the one creature with the rest of its body trapped underground with just the three heads sticking out. They slay it, and are soon met by some tunnel workers from Hew. The workers give them gas masks, saying that if they breathe in any more of the gas they would most likely die. As they rest in a nearby building, the workers hold a meeting in an adjacent room. They start to argue, saying that the taxes they pay are extremely high due to the ZPCI's protection fees, which they do not believe they even need to pay anymore as they have not seen any zombies in a long time. Suddenly, a bloody body comes crashing through the skylight and onto the table. One of the workers identifies him as his brother, and in their rebellious state of mind the workers blame his death on the ZPCI. A dark figure (the same shape as Felicity) appears in the skylight before leaving quickly, though no one sees her. The workers, in a frenzy, start chanting \"Down with the Mayor!\". A group of police walk in on them and order them to return to their homes. It is around this point that a revolt is set fully in motion, and mobs of workers start marching towards the Mayor's office. Sonny, Veradux, and Roald join the revolt and fight their way through various soldiers attempting to police the streets. Along the way, they meet Felicity again. She expresses her desire to join them, as she has her own reasons for wanting the Mayor deposed. Sonny and Felicity soon encounter the mayor across a wide fissure in the ground, which prevents them from attacking him. They do, however, overhear a ZPCI ambassador telling the Mayor that plans are already in motion to subdue the masses once again. The Mayor then sees Felicity and exclaims that he thought she was dead. He implores the ambassador to protect him from her before departing. Sonny, Felicity, Roald, and Veradux continue their push to the Mayor's office, slaughtering everyone who stand in their way, including the city council and their secret police. The ZPCI, however, are not seen: they had apparently decided not to get involved just yet, leaving Hew to its own devices. When they reach the Mayor's office, they find him ready for battle. After defeating him, some of the rest of the workers catch up. As Sonny wipes the slime from himself from the tunnel of illusions, the workers see that he is not, as they had thought, a man covered in slime, but rather a zombie covered in slime. Some show hostility and mistrust, but are soon convinced by the others to accept Sonny, based on the fact that he helped them to overthrow the Mayor. The workers regard Sonny as a hero for helping overthrow the corrupt government of Hew. In the aftermath, Felicity explains the situation with the ZPCI. They are an organization devoted to protecting the general population from zombies - sometimes defensively, sometimes aggressively. However, threats to their organization's well-being began to arise in the form of scientists attempting to find a cure for zombification, the success of which would render the ZPCI useless as a service. Therefore, they destroyed such groups of scientists undercover wherever they found them, shutting down their operations and killing everyone involved. Though they are elated after their victory, Roald reminds them of the ambassador's words earlier, and remarks that the ZPCI probably have a plan to put down the rebellion. Sonny decides to track down the ambassador in order to find out more information. The final scene shows a conference of five high-level ZPCI officials, deciding what to do about the revolt. One suggests calling down a nuclear strike, but this is rejected by the leader. He states that they will be using \"the seed\", which is met by general gasps of shock and fear. What \"the seed\" is is currently unknown, but this will likely be revealed in Sonny 3.Credits Soundtrack  Battle: Roaming Mode: Cutscenes: Both the 3rd and 6th cutscenes have unnamed background music.Baron Brixius  Baron Brixius is one of the major antagonists in the series, and a mini-boss in both Sonny and Sonny 2. In the first game, he is fought with the assistance of Galiant the Paladin, a temporary follower. Baron Brixius is a powerful zombie overlord who uses mind control to bend hordes of zombies to his will. He is manipulative and psychotic, enjoying engineering pointless conflict for no purpose other than his own personal enjoyment (as evidenced by his activities in Oberursel). In battle, he mostly uses a combination of shadow-based psychological attacks and wields a two-handed sword.Involvement Sonny 1  In the first game, the Baron appears in Gadi'Kala. As Sonny and Veradux fight their way across the plains, their heads feel more and more painful due to Brixius' attempts at mind control, particularly Sonny's, whenever they fight creatures called Devourers (slaves of the Baron). After the Shamans have been eradicated, they encounter a Zombie Ambassador, sent to tell them that they would submit to the Baron. After killing it and a few ZPCI soldiers, Sonny and Veradux arrive at a battle between the Baron and Galiant the Paladin, a high-ranking ZPCI officer. With his help, the Baron is defeated, but Veradux convinces Sonny that they should attack and kill the Paladin on the grounds that he is a ZPCI officer and therefore their enemy.Sonny 2  In the second game, Baron Brixius is encountered again in the village of Oberursel. It appears that he was not in fact killed, and is now the leader of a cult within the village. When Sonny and Veradux entered the village, they were met by a band of insurgents, rebelling against the cult's destructive influence. Roald, one of the insurgents, promised to take the two of them to the Utopia if they helped destroy the cult. Sonny and Veradux agreed and, despite having to fight through many monsters, undead, and cult members, they eventually reach the leader. After a battle with him, he reveals his true form as that of Baron Brixius; he battles them again, this time using his full power. He is defeated anyway, and the discovery of his true identity disgusts and disappoints the remains of the cult, causing them to disperse. Under normal circumstances, the Baron's death would be considered almost certain; however, bearing in mind that he has managed to cheat death once before, at this point it is by no means certain that he is permanently dead.Theory  Multiple parties have been shown to be trying to find a cure for zombification; namely the crew of the White November and the Insurgents. Louis the Blind made a partially successful attempt at a cure, resulting in Sonny, while Veradux and Felicity provide evidence that at least two other partial cures were undertaken by parties unknown. It is possible that the Baron is a similarly-revived zombie. In this case, he may serve as an evil counterpart to Sonny, fully embracing his monstrous nature rather than regaining some of his former humanity.Boss (Sonny) Tactics  The Baron is proficient in all four types of attributes (Vitality, Strength, Magic, and Speed), making him one of the most dangerous opponents in the game. His general attacks can result in substantial damage, especially for the classes with low health such as Assassins and Gunslingers. He also uses Decay, which not only has exceptionally high damage, but also applies a stacking Damage-Over-Time debuff. The Baron\u2019s most deadly abilities are his Shadow Blend which draws his maximum damage, and his stun with a 4-turn duration. Perhaps the most daunting characteristic about the Baron is his overwhelmingly high health, which, at a glance, seems too much for the player and Veradux alone to handle. In order to defeat the Baron, the player should take the full advantage of Galiant the Paladin. Because of the immense amount of the Baron\u2019s health, the player\u2019s strongest attacks such as Master Strike and Coup De Grace are completely useless. Instead, the player should use abilities that will either immobilize the Baron or aid the Paladin in combat. By stunning the Baron, the team will be able to buy some time for the Paladin\u2019s attacks and to heal. In order to amplify the Paladin\u2019s damage, the player can use abilities such as Wound, Sunder, Magic Bolt, and Void to lower the Baron\u2019s defense against the Paladin\u2019s attacks. Alternately, the player can simply choose to heal his allies and provide buffs when necessary. To counter against the Baron\u2019s attack, classes with low health are advised to use defensive abilities such as Block, Suppression, Intervention, or Iron Skin to mollify or nullify the Baron\u2019s attack.Cult Leader Tactics Boss (Sonny 2) Tactics  The Sonny 2 Baron battle plays out in 2 distinct stages. Until he reaches 50% HP, the Baron can be easily damaged by draining his Focus, as when he runs out of Focus, he will use Deep Burning, which deals very high damage to him. Watch out while draining his Focus, as he may occasionally use the ability Electrical Storm, which also restores Focus. Dux Electro, Disrupt, and Shock Therapy can dispel the Energized buff he gains from it. Abilities effective at draining the Baron's Focus, by class: Hydraulic: Biological: Psychological: It is recommended that you set Roald and Veradux to Phalanx mode when fighting the Baron, as healing is an effective way to survive the Baron's ability that causes the buff Tick Tock. However, Roald's healing spell aren't very useful, so if you have given him high strength, you'd better keep him attacking, as when he dies the Baron will have low health already, and you will \"use\" Veradux only on you. Once the Baron's health gets lower than 50%, he will occasionally use the skill Holy Scars. When this happens, set your team to relentless A.I. and attack him, as all damage to him receives a massive multiplier. You can also continue to drain his Focus, as if Deep Burning and Holy Scars stack the Baron can take a lot of damage (over 100000). Although in this stage he will preferentially use Electrical Storm, draining his Focus again immediately after he does so will force him to use Deep Burning. A Hydraulic character can use Mind Freeze and Flash Freeze together in this stage to prevent him from using any Focus skills. This will leave him only able to use Electrical Storm and Holy Scars, and he will frequently skip his turn, although he will be regenerating too much focus to use Deep Burning, so keep an eye on him.Trivia Abilities  Abilities are the means by which characters fight and defend themselves in battle. There are many different abilities that do many different things, providing the flexibility required to adjust to almost any playing style. Whenever Sonny levels up, he gains one ability point to spend in the ability tree. Ability points can be reset through re-specing, which either costs in-game money or can only be done a limited amount per real-time day, depending on the game in question.Types of Abilities  There are two different types of abilities: active and passive. Active abilities are abilities that require activation within the battle, requiring a cost in focus, health, or neither. Passive abilities are abilities that are always \"on\" in combat. So, they don't need to be activated manually and will always be active. Also, they don't take up space on your actions ring. Both types of abilities can be obtained through the skill tree.Sonny Abilities  In Sonny, there is only one ability tree across all four character classes, and it is possible to Re-spec for free up to five times per real-time day. Click on any icon in the ability tree to be taken to its page.Sonny 2 Abilities  In Sonny 2, each of the three classes has its own separate ability tree. Re-specing costs money (in game), with the price increasing with your increasing level; however, it can be performed as many times as you want. The player also starts the game with 5 ability points while at Level 1, unlike in the first game. Click on any icon in one of three ability trees below to be taken to its page.Tutorial  Sonny has access to two additional skills during the tutorial:A.I Exclusive Abilities  In Sonny and Sonny 2, there are many abilities that can be used by the teammates and enemies that Sonny himself is not able to use. See the page, A.I. Exclusive Abilities for the complete list.Trivia Felicity  Felicity is an enemy in Sonny 2, and toward the end of the game she joins Sonny's party and becomes a playable character. She is a Blade Dancer, and she joins Sonny's party after the player completes stage 5 at Hew.Background  Felicity is a female zombie that first appears as an antagonist at the beginning of Sonny 2 when she steals the tape from Sonny. She later reappears as the boss of New Alcatraz, fiercely determined to keep the tape from returning to Sonny. However, when she is losing in combat, she tosses the tape back to Sonny and escapes, but not before hurling a knife into Veradux's face (for the second time). She then escapes, carrying a body of an unknown individual and bidding farewell to the duo. She can ride a motorbike well and has a fondness for using throwing knives in combat. The fact that she consistently ends up throwing a knife into Veradux's face almost every time they encounter her is a recurring joke throughout Sonny 2. Felicity reappears in Hew at Stage 5, offering her skills as she also wishes to see the Mayor overthrown. Later on in the stage, a cutscene between Felicity and the Mayor reveals that the Mayor knew Felicity when she was alive (not as a zombie), and is immensely afraid of Felicity.Theory  No evidence has currently been given for how Veradux and Felicity became zombies. The only known groups trying to find a cure for zombification were the Insurgents and the crew of White November, both of whom were attacked by the ZPCI. However, due to the existence of intelligent zombies such as Felicity, Baron Brixius, Sonny, and Veradux, one of the research teams must have been able to revive zombies at some point. It is possible that Felicity, Veradux, and Baron Brixius were revived by one of these teams. At the end of Stage 4, a silhouette that looks like Felicity rescinds back after a body was dropped in during a worker's meeting. This final spark lit the fire that started the riots in Hew. Though it is not confirmed whether Felicity was actually the one who instigated the riot, it does coincide with her desire to see the Mayor of Hew overthrown. Back when Felicity wasn't a zombie, she has been acquainted with the Mayor of Hew. At some point, the Mayor thought she was dead and did not expect her to return in Hew as a zombie. The Mayor is extremely afraid of Felicity, frantically calling for the ZPCI Ambassador to 'keep her away from me'.Tactics  Felicity always begins her boss battle with the Blade Dance ability, which shields her. A physical attacker should focus on rushing her shield down, as breaking it prematurely will lower Felicity's physical defense. Felicity's most common attack is Black Metal, which cuts down healing by 95%. This heavily impacts Veradux's ability to heal in combat. It is recommended for players to set Veradux's team command to be offensive so as to not let him waste heals. When Felicity reaches 50% health or below, she uses Serious Business which halves damage taken and increases the damage she does. A player with burst or combo damage can choose to unleash their arsenal at when Felicity is somewhere above 50% health, so she would be easier to deal with after Serious Business. After using Serious Business, Felicity will also begin to use other abilities like Garrote (silences) and Shadow Blend (boosts speed). However, if stunned when she is supposed to use Serious Business, she will be forced to wait until the stun ends before using Serious Business, and if the player can deal enough damage to push her HP into the next phase, where she uses Shadow Blend, a glitch occurs in which she completely skips using Serious Business, which makes the fight a lot easier. It is rather tricky to execute this procedure, and can usually only be done after beating the boss fight once and gathering some more powerful equipment. It is recommended for players to use attacks that can't be evaded when Felicity uses Shadow Blend, as it can be difficult to hit her in that form. The battle ends prematurely when Felicity reaches 10% health, though it is possible to outright kill her before that happens.Trivia Hydraulic  Hydraulic (German: Hydraulic) is a class in Sonny 2. Unlike other two classes, this class is exclusive to the game client in Armor Games. The Hydraulic class provides extensive diversity, allowing for much greater flexibility than the other two classes. The two main trees within the class are the hot and cold trees. Hot Hydraulic abilities are designed to maximize damage output using Strength as the only co-efficient, while cold abilities tend to focus more on defensive and disabling abilities.Builds Hot Hydraulic (Avenger)  Most of the hot abilities are unlocked through the passive ability 'Hot Blooded', which increases Strength by 50% but also causes Sonny to lose 10 Focus per turn. As most of the attacks scale with the amount of Focus (though don't require any), a Hot Hydraulic character must constantly keep his Focus up for his attacks to be effective. However, Regulate at max can counteract this and if needed, you can use Vapour Cannon to gain Focus. Most hot Hydraulic abilities are physical element.Cold Hydraulic (Guardian)  The Guardian build uses both Instinct and Strength as a co-efficient. Cold Hydraulic uses almost entirely ice abilities, which will scale more with Instinct than Strength at higher levels. Some, like Shatter, will be based only on Instinct. The \"Guardian\"'s attacks tend to weaken and disable the opponent, such as Glacier and Flash Freeze. The Guardian tends to have a lot of health, and abilities are available to resist damage and guard allies, such as Cold Neurology and Safe Guard. The Cold Hydraulic tends to control how the battle works and use it to keep allies alive and enemies unable to attack properly, similar to the Psychological class. The Cold Hydraulic's abilities don't cost any focus at high levels. The Cold Hydraulic can easily recover with Restore or Vapour Cannon if needed.Abilities Visual Map  Click on any icon in the ability tree to be taken to its page.Listing  Abilities are listed in chains based on their dependence.Veradux  Veradux is a deuteragonist character from Sonny, Sonny 2, and Sonny (2017). He, like all the male characters, is voiced by Andrew Dennis. In the first two games, Veradux is an intelligent zombie with the Combat Medic class. He is the only ally with this class. In the third game, Sonny (2017), there are no classes, but Veradux continues with his traditional role as a combat medic; this time as a human.Personality  Though Veradux is portrayed as somewhat of a joker, he has shown a serious side, such as when convincing Sonny to turn against the Paladin in Sonny 1. In Sonny 2, Veradux continues being a companion to Sonny, sometimes offering advice, but mostly offering humor. In Sonny (2017), Veradux stays as joking veteran, occasionally acting serious or poking fun at others.History Sonny  Sonny first meets Veradux on Ishiguro's Rest in the first game. Sonny finds him as he tries to fight three ZPCI hunters, and helps him take them down. Veradux has stolen a set of ZPCI Combat Medic armor and can efficiently heal and shoot using their equipment. At Gadi'Kala,Veradux says that he will be with Sonny until \"death do [them] part.\" Throughout Gadi'Kala he supports Sonny and helps Sonny to disguise as the Galiant the Paladin's helpers to defeat the Baron.Sonny 2  At the start of Sonny 2, Veradux and Sonny were resting at a camp sight until Felicity suddenly attacked them for the tape Louis the Blind gave to Sonny. Felicity threw a knife to stagger Veradux. This caused Sonny and Veradux to chase Felicity, leading them to New Alcatraz.Sonny (2017)  In the remake of Sonny, Veradux is a human and a former military medic who became a paraplegic after taking a bullet to the spine, which resulted in the Army removing him from active duty. He signed up to trial the new InfectAid Medic Suit, which allowed him to walk again and protect the locals. Unfortunately, everyone else who tried the suit were eventually killed, leaving him the sole survivor. As he makes a last stand in The Silver Strand, he is found by a wandering Sonny; together they overcome the swarm of zombies and monsters and thereon stick together.Theory (Sonny 1 & 2)  No evidence has currently been given for how Veradux and Felicity became zombies. The only known groups trying to find a cure for zombification were the Insurgents and the crew of White November, and both were attacked by the ZPCI. However, due to the existence of intelligent zombies such as Felicity, Baron Brixius, Sonny, and Veradux, one of the research teams must have been able to revive zombies at some point. It's possible that Felicity, Veradux, and Baron Brixius were revived by one of these teams.Sonny (2017)  Veradux is met in The Silver Strand as a Lvl 4; after the battle he levels up to 5. Starting Equipment: Infectaid gear & gun [please add details]Abilities  Attack: Physical | Basic Attack | Deals [formula unknown] damage. Electro Bolt: Electric | 3? Cooldown | Deals [formula unknown damage and dispels a random buff from the target. Heal: Nature | 2? Cooldown | Heals an ally for [formula unknown] HP. Area Heal: Nature | 3? Cooldown | Heals all allies for [formula unknown] HP.Strategies  Veradux mainly serves as a heavy duty healer in this game, and should be treated as such. Thus, he should mainly be used on a team that lacks healing abilities. However, it should be kept in mind that Electro Bolt can be used to 1) remove a buff from an enemy and 2) change an adaptive defense passive to defend against electric attacks, thereby rendering the enemy vulnerable to other types of attacks. Note that Veradux's healing abilities scale with his Power; it is advised that Veradux at minimum always has enough power to fully heal allies with his Heal ability. That being said, it is also advised that his other stats are also not neglected; make sure that he has enough Vitality and Defense to be able to tank a few hits without immediately dying, as well as enough Speed to allow him to heal whenever necessary. TDLR: Power should be high enough to heal allies to full HP in one heal. Vitality and Defense should be high enough to ensure he he can take a few hits. Speed should be high enough to heal allies often. Anything extra should always go to increase his Speed.Tactics  As Veradux's abilities scale with every attribute, it is best to give him balanced armor. At the end of Sonny, it is wise to give Veradux Paladin's Armor. At end of Sonny 2, it is wise to give him Surgeon's Armor. A player who wants a more damaging Veradux should give him equipment that improves Strength, as it improves his Dux Leading Strike and Dux Electro. A player who wants a more supportive Veradux should give Instinct equipment, which his heal scales heavily off. In Sonny 2, Veradux's abilities allow him to be a strong damage-dealer at the start. However, his combat capabilities wane in contrast to other companions like Roald and Felicity. He makes up for this with his powerful heal.Trivia Sithu Aye  Hi, I'm DartHolderX. You can call me Dart, Holder, DHX, or whatever is convenient as long as recognizable and appropriate. I like to play RPG flash games, like Arcuz I/II and Sonny I/II. I am a frequent editor in Bakugan Wikia, one of the top ten anime Wiki, so I have ideas of what the pages are supposed to look like. I am not very good with making my own templates though. I am also a reticent member of the Wikia Community Council, and an adoptive Bureaucrat of the eXceed Wiki. My edits are both trivial and sometimes constructive. I am also moderately knowledgable about both of the Sonny games. I created a few essential templates here and there, but I can't comprehend most of the code myself. It is nice to see more users coming to the Wiki and contribute. But as it rows along so, I think an order is needed to be structure on here in certain way for an adequate control. There are many pages that are missing content or information, which leaves more users more room to contribute. The head Administrator/Bureaucrat of this Wiki is ShadowenX. I myself is yet another Administrator of the Wiki. Keep in mind that I'm not a Bureaucrat though. Since I am more active, it would be best to contact me if any issue that involve administrative concerns arises. The two other active users here are Dark123456789 and Firecrow91. Besides me, they are probably the best to contact if any general question ponders. Also, Firecrow has access to the source code of the game, so if you have any questions about it, he is the best to ask.

Like all the male characters, he is voiced by Andrew Dennis. Sonny is an intelligent zombie, with the capacity to speak and behave like a normal human being. He is one of the few known zombies to be intelligent, including Veradux and Felicity, being able to live and interact like normal humans.Background  Details about his life before he was zombified are almost totally unknown. Both his zombification and death probably happened on the research ship White November, which is also the place where he was revived by Louis the Blind or Louis. The reason of his death is unknown, but it could have been from being attacked by the Zombies and Metabiis on the ship. His identity before his zombification and death is also kept totally untold, and Sonny himself doesn't have any memory of his life or about himself before these events. The possibilities of his identity are vast, as he could have been anyone on and off the ship - one of the crew, a passenger, a researcher, or someone else. It's possible that he and Louis knew each other before Sonny lost his memory, possibly as friends, as Louis had told Sonny that he was a friend when Sonny asked who he was.Involvement  Once Sonny is brought back to life by Louis, the two of them attempt to escape White November together on a speedboat. They fight their way to the speedboat hangar, but as they are about to reach it, they encounter a team of ZPCI soldiers, sent to eradicate everything to do with the research on White November. One of them shoots Louis, and in a vengeful frenzy Sonny kills them all. As Louis lies dying in Sonny's arms, he hands him a tape, telling him: \"It's a tape. Maybe it can help you.\" He then breathes his last breath, and Sonny escapes alone on a speedboat as ZPCI helicopters search the ship. He then lands on a coastline named\u00a0Ishiguro's Rest and fights numerous zombies as well as ZPCI operatives. He meets Veradux, another intelligent zombie,\u00a0there after helping him fight off ZPCI hunters. The two of them continue onwards with Sonny in search of answers and Veradux deciding to tag along, and make their way to\u00a0Gadi'Kala, the Great Plains. There, they encounter an aggressive shaman tribe that refuses to allow them to pass. While mowing their way through the tribe, they experience headaches and disorientation, Sonny in particular, while fighting zombies named Devourers;\u00a0the cause soon reveals itself as\u00a0a\u00a0Zombie Ambassador\u00a0approaches them, stating that he is a servant of the zombie overlord Baron Brixius, who requests they submit to his control. The duo refuse and kill the ambassador then proceed forward, running into a trio of specialised ZPCI soldiers who are on their way to assist their leader in his battle against the Baron. Sonny and Veradux kill them and take their place in the battle between\u00a0Galiant The Paladin\u00a0and Baron Brixius, with Verdux urging Sonny to go along with pretending to be the Paladin's backup. After defeating the Baron, Veradux turns on the Paladin knowing the ZPCI's stark opinion on zombies and pressures Sonny into it for that reason, as Sonny is conflicted about doing so since the ZPCI leader helped them. Sonny eventually gives in and takes down the Paladin together with Veradux. In Sonny 2, the duo is shown to be travelling on aimlessly, as Sonny tries to find something to play the tape with. When the two are camping out, they were suddenly attacked by a female motorcyclist, who slams her bike on Sonny and throws a knife in Veradux's face. Their assailant, Felicity, then grabs Sonny's tape and rides into a nearby prison, New Alcatraz. The duo pursues her and enters the facility. In New Alcatraz, a riot has broken out between the guards and the prisoners, and the duo fights through both. It is revealed that the prison is grounds for a ZPCI operation that involves cruel experiments on prisoners, turning them into bloodthirsty monsters under the control of scientists. The duo takes down ZPCI Elites, the prison's Head Warden, guards and scientists before finding Felicity, who is trying to escape in a car. Veradux disables the car with an electric shot from his rifle, and Sonny demands the tape back. Felicity challenges his claimed ownership of the tape, and says that the tape is 'the key to Utopia'. Sonny doesn't understand, and initiates combat. When Felicity is close to being defeated, she stabs Veradux in the face again, tossing the tape and distracting Sonny before she flees in an elevator, carrying an unknown body. The duo then enters Felicity's car, which has a tape player. To Sonny's dismay, the tape only plays the song \"You are my Sunshine\", and infuriates him. Veradux jokes that maybe Felicity just really loves that song. Sonny then finds a map (with a trail leading to a big X), and then begun driving the car to find the Utopia that Felicity mentioned. The car breaks down at Oberursel, and the duo is forced to continue on foot. There, they encounter zombies, insurgents and members of a cult. After exchanging blows with some insurgents, the insurgents realize that Sonny and Veradux are 'not like the others' and are intelligent zombies, and says that they are not enemies. The Insurgents, one of them Roald, explains that they came from Utopia, where they were trying to search for a cure for zombification, but were disrupted by random kidnappings and killings, and fled to Oberursel. In the area instead they find a cult who sacrifices innocent people. Sonny asks for the location of Utopia, and Roald bargains that if they help to take down the cult, he would join the duo and lead them there. The trio then begin pushing into the cult's stronghold, eventually reaching the leader. When fighting the leader, Sonny begun experiencing pain in his head - pain which is very familiar to both Sonny and Veradux. The Cult Leader then reveals himself to be Baron Brixius from Gadi'Kala, who has somehow escaped death and set up another point of conflict for his own enjoyment. The trio then takes down Baron Brixius, who is still suffering from injuries that he sustained in their previous battle. The cult members, seeing that their leader is a zombie, become disillusioned and abandon the cult. Then, ZPCI helciopters begin entering Oberursel, and started firing on the various entities in the area. The trio then fights some ZPCI units before facing a Captain Hunt and his team, who orders everyone in the area to be killed. After an extended battle, Roald brings the group into the Ivory Line to evade the ZPCI.Personality  Sonny's personality is a bit difficult to pin down due to the nature of the Sonny series, but the following can be inferred from the information given. Sonny is shown to be somewhat of a joker, but easily shifts to his more serious side when his friends are in danger. This causes his allies to place great faith in him as he always will act in their defense if he is angered and they are in danger. This trait seems to give him some romantic sway over Felicity, who describes him to be a sort of knight like figure in battle, who always comes to his friends' rescue and follows his heart no matter what. She sums up her view of him as being \"a sort of undead Sir Lancelot\". He is often heard having an exasperated tone of voice even in fights, and even jokes about his enemies as a way of relieving his tension. Sonny also finds some serious events as fodder for humor. An example of this is when Felicity is encountered in Hew. Remembering that in their previous encounter, Veradux was hit in the cheek with a knife, Sonny replies, \"Quick! Cover your face!!\" Sonny is quite the conflicted character outside of battle due to his confusion about his identity and history, causing him to take drastic action at times for the possibility of getting answers. This also manifests as a somewhat stronger, compared to Veradux, weakness to mind control. Sonny can also be rather fatalistic sometimes when people are in his and his friends way, showing disregard for their lives if they try to cause him problems.Gameplay  Sonny is the primary protagonist in the Sonny RPG series, and he gains experience along with party members after every fight. Sonny levels up after gaining sufficient experience. Every level-up grants Sonny Ability Points and Attribute Points, which can be used to activate upgrades. Ability Points are used to unlock or improve Abilities, which are based on Sonny's class (see Classes). Abilities are used for powerful attacks, healing, or to temporarily improve/reduce a character's Attributes. Players have a wide range of different Abilities to unlock, that enable the creation of different \"builds\". For example in Sonny 2, the Hydraulic class contains abilities for a \"Hot Hydraulic\" build, which focuses on attack, and a \"Cold Hydraulic\" build which focuses on defense. Attribute Points are used to improve Sonny's 4 basic Attributes, consisting of Vitality, Strength, Instinct, Speed. The fifth Attribute, Focus, cannot be improved with Attribute Points in any game. The importance of attributes various depending on Sonny's class. Sonny also has a range of Piercing and Defense attributes, such as Lighting, Fire, Ice, and so on. Some special equipment contain bonuses for such attributes, that improves attacks of that type. Sonny can wear/wield different kinds of equipment. Before a fight, players can modify the equipment configuration, or visit the Zone Shop to trade equipment. Also, certain enemies drop rare equipment that cannot be purchased at shops. Before a fight, players can select a ring of 8 Abilities (the \"Combat Action Bar\") that can be used during a fight. Certain powerful abilities can be added multiple times to the ring, allowing for usage in successive turns. During a fight, the player can only control Sonny directly. The player can choose an enemy to attack, as well as an ability from the ring to attack/defend with. Certain abilities affect Sonny and party members (such as healing abilities) and certain can only be used on enemies (defensive and offensive abilities).Classes in Sonny 1  The following is a list of the classes for Sonny, in Sonny 1. Players can only select a class at the beginning of the game.

Players can only select a class at the beginning of the game. Click on a class to learn more about the Abilities it offers.Strains in Sonny (2017)  The following is a list of strains in Sonny (2017). Strains replaced classes in the game and Sonny is stuck with the physical strain until a certain point of the game where the player can choose their desired strain.Trivia Boris Livingstone  The Mayor/Boris Livingstone appears during Sonny 2 during Hew. He and Guardian Cannon are the final bosses of the zone.Background  Boris Livingstone was the appointed Mayor of Hew, before his death during the revolt at the hands of Sonny and his party. Not much is known about the Mayor's background, though it is evident that at some point he killed Felicity, or ordered her to be killed. He is surprised and horrified, therefore, when he sees her risen as a zombie during the revolt, and implores the ZPCI to protect him from her.Trivia Louis the Blind  Louis the Blind, or Louis, is a man Sonny gets to know at the very beginning of Sonny. He teaches the player how to fight and defend themselves to survive on the battlefield.Background  Not much is known about him. He probably was one of the passengers, or a part of the crew on-board the ship. From the way he talks to Sonny after he revives him, it is likely that he was Sonny's friend before death. Even though he is blind he somehow manages to \"see\" and explain to Sonny what to do in certain situation. He may have a link to Veradux, as he is in the same zombified state as Sonny is. He may be an Insurgent, like Roald, as they were trying to \"find a cure to the condition.\"Death  At the last battle of Zone 1, he gets shot and mortally wounded by the ZPCI team and (though his body disappears in-game) lies bleeding on the ground. His last action is to transfer the Tape to Sonny, an object that becomes the focus of the second game. His body is presumably burned along with the White November as Sonny escapes on a speedboat.Trivia ZPCI  ZPCI (Zombie Pest Control Incorporated) is a fictional organization in Sonny and Sonny 2. Its members are dedicated to keeping the zombie population under control. They do this mainly by protecting the general public from zombies and by hunting down and killing as many as possible. They are the main antagonistic faction of the game. Undercover, however, the ZPCI will resort to any measures to keep in business, including murdering and/or kidnapping anyone involved in research of a cure for zombification. An example of this is their extermination of everyone on the White November research ship at the beginning of Sonny. It is also implied that they experimented on people in order to create stronger zombies. At the same time, they also seem to rule the citizen with an iron fist and force them to pay unnecessary high tax as well as setting puppet government to do their dirty work in this case is Boris Livingstone. They are also extremely ruthless in crushing rebellion from the citizen when one of the high-ranking official suggests to initiate a nuclear strike against the rebels to set the example for anyone dare to oppose them. Almost all ZPCI soldiers use rifles of one kind or another. The two exceptions to this are the ZPCI Captain, whom Sonny encounters while attempting to escape from the White November research ship and Galiant the Paladin, both of whom used two-handed swords, but can somehow both fire ranged attacks, possibly lasers.Known Units Confirmed ZPCI Associated Units Possible Members of ZPCI  \u00a0Sonny (Game)  Sonny is a role-playing flash game created by Krin and published under Armor Games. It was first released on December 28, 2007. Its storyline is continued in Sonny 2. The game has four zones: three story zones and one bonus zone. Sonny 2 is set in the same universe as Sonny, a world with a vast array of technology and mental disciplines. Characters and NPCs use a variety of clubs, swords, rifles, staffs, magic, and more in combat, as well as utilizing a great number of specialized physical and mental attacks. Much of the world seems to be overrun with zombies, which is probably the reason that the ZPCI (Zombie Pest Control Incorporated) was formed. The ZPCI are the main antagonists of the series; they will stop at nothing to remain in business, killing everyone involved in any research designed to find a cure for zombification. Sonny frequently runs into ZPCI soldiers, as they attempt to kill him on sight (due to the fact that he is a zombie). The ZPCI have a large presence in many places, particularly in large cities such as Hew. The plot of Sonny focuses on the Tape, an object given to Sonny by his mentor Louis the Blind. Sonny passes through the haunted beach (Ishiguro's Rest) and attempts to reach the city of Hew. His party must battle various enemies that reside on the \"great plains\" (Gadi'Kala) between them and Hew.Gameplay  The gameplay of Sonny is entirely single-player. Gameplay is divided into three main interfaces: 1. The World Map, which shows all discovered locations (see Zones). From this screen the player can travel to zones that they have been to before. 2. The Roaming-Mode screen, in which the player can prepare for their next battle by organizing their inventory, their equipment, their skills (see Attributes and Abilities), saving the game, and visiting shops. This is the main screen, and players can engage in training battles, or primary battles to move further into the zone. 3. The Battle screen, where the player's team fights turn-based battles against the opposing team. On the player's turn, they may only control their own character (Sonny) directly by selecting abilities to use on a particular target of choice.Abilities  Sonny gains experience along with party members after every fight. Sonny levels up after gaining sufficient experience. Every level-up grants Sonny Ability Points and Attribute Points, which can be used to activate upgrades. Ability Points are used to unlock or improve Abilities. Abilities are used for powerful attacks, healing, or to temporarily improve/reduce a character's Attributes. Unlike Sonny 2\u00a0and Sonny (2017), in Sonny 1 the ability tree is the same for all Classes. Attribute Points are used to improve Sonny's 4 basic Attributes, consisting of Vitality, Strength, Instinct, Speed. The fifth Attribute, Focus, cannot be improved with Attribute Points. The importance of attributes various depending on Sonny's class. Sonny also has a range of Piercing and Defense attributes, such as Lighting, Fire, Ice, and so on. Some special equipment contain bonuses for such attributes, that improves attacks of that type. Sonny can wear/wield different kinds of equipment. Before a fight, players can modify the equipment configuration, or visit the Zone Shop to trade equipment. Also, certain enemies drop rare equipment that cannot be purchased at shops. Before a fight, players can select a ring of 8 Abilities (the \"Combat Action Bar\") that can be used during a fight. Certain powerful abilities can be added twice to the ring, allowing for usage in successive turns. During a fight, the player can only control Sonny directly. The player can choose an enemy to attack, as well as an ability from the ring to attack/defend with. Certain abilities affect Sonny and party members (such as healing abilities) and certain can only be used on enemies (defensive and offensive abilities).Classes  The following is a list of the classes for Sonny. Players can only select a class at the beginning of the game. Click on a class to learn more about the Abilities it offers.Characters Plot  The story begins with a cutscene where Sonny explains that he has died on a ship and has somehow been brought back to life as a zombie by Louis the Blind. However, he suffers from major amnesia, having forgotten everything before his \"death\". Louis calls him Sonny and the two of them try to find a way off the ship. He teaches Sonny how to defend himself and advises him on what to do to survive on the battlefield. After Sonny has fought through several metabiis and zombies, they meet a ZPCI team, sent to exterminate everyone on board the ship because of the research that they had been doing. Louis is shot and lies bleeding on the ground. They attack Sonny, yet he destroys them, and another cutscene plays as Louis dies in Sonny's arms. As Louis dies, he gives Sonny a tape saying: \"It's a tape. Maybe it can help you.\" Sonny escapes the ship via a motor boat and arrives at a haunted beach, known as Ishiguro's Rest. There, Sonny confronts more ZPCI Soldiers, zombies, ghost samurai and assassins. On the way, he meets his first partner Veradux, who is a combat medic and also a zombie, who helps him to fight against some ZPCI soldiers. The two of them fight their way through more samurai, assassins and ZPCI hunters to the end of the beach, where they encounter and slay Sensei Ishiguro. Once they get off the beach, they must cross Gadi'Kala, the Great Plains, a wide, flat expanse surrounded by mountains. Living in the area are various tribes, but by far the most dominant and hostile in the region is that of the Shamans. Once Sonny and Veradux have destroyed the Shaman tribe, they begin encountering zombie-like creatures known as devourers. Whenever they fight them, their heads start hurting, especially Sonny's. Veradux concludes that someone is playing with their minds. They also run into more ZPCI soldiers, but it is clear that they are not on the same side as the devourers as the ZPCI are also killing them. Sonny and Veradux fight on, their heads hurting more and more. They kill a unit of ZPCI that were talking about going to help the Paladin kill the Baron; they meet the Paladin shortly afterwards, who is just about to attack Baron Brixius. Baron Brixius is an extremely powerful zombie overlord. He uses mind control to bring other zombies under his control, then uses them to further his own ends. Sonny and Veradux' heads had been hurting because of the influence of the Baron, whose servants were the devourers. They had presumably resisted thus far because of their unusual intelligence and willpower among zombies. Posing as the reinforcements that the Paladin was expecting, Sonny and Veradux join him in his attempt to take down the Baron. However, after slaying the Baron, the two heroes turn on the Paladin and cut him down as well. They travel on, and the story ends, to be continued in Sonny 2.Credits Soundtrack  The Music in Sonny was created by David Orr and Martijn Vranken. Battle: Roaming Mode: Cutscenes: In addition, the first and third cutscenes have unnamed background music.See Also Shunny  Shunny is an enemy from Labyrinth in Sonny 2. Also he looks exactly like Sonny at the start of the tutorial.Battle Abilities  He also has Disrupt (Enemy Skill) coded, but is unable to use it due to a glitch preventing AI characters from using Focus-modifying Offensive skills on enemies.Tactics  Poison Bio: Occasionally Crystallizing him, using Anesthetic to reduce his focus and damage output and Envenom to deal some decent Damage Over Time can work well against this enemy. After his focus reaches 0, he can only start hitting you with Glacial Chills. You will tell when it is preparing to use Withdrawal because it wil luse Leading strike on the turn before. Crystallize after the Leading Strike and keep it locked. Every time it wakes up, it will suffer damage due to DOT effects from Envenoms and Anesthetics. Continue until you win.Trivia See Also Galiant the Paladin  Galiant the Paladin is the final boss of Gadi'Kala in Sonny. He is also a temporary teammate of the player in the battle against the Baron Brixius in the previous stage. Galiant the Paladin is a ZPCI Officer, apparently with the rank of Paladin. He is a powerful ally and enemy with 4000 Focus Points and the ability to heal his entire health in a single turn.Involvement As an Ally  When Sonny first encounters him, he is about to begin his battle with Baron Brixus, a powerful zombie overlord. The Paladin mistakes Sonny and Veradux for his reinforcements, whom the protagonists had defeated just before. Sonny and Veradux decide to play along in order to more easily defeat the Baron. However, during the fight, Galiant begins to question whether they are really his reinforcements, as his real reinforcements consisted of a group of three.As an Enemy  After Brixius has been defeated, Veradux persuades Sonny to attack the Paladin, much to the Paladin's surprise. Veradux says humans view Sonny and Veradux as \"monsters\", and that they can either be \"alive monsters\" or \"dead monsters\". Sonny is reluctant to do so, since the Paladin helped them defeat the Baron, but he does it anyway.Tactics  In order to defeat Galiant the Paladin is to weaken him so he heals. Because his heal requires quarter of his total Focus, he should quickly run out of Focus to the point that he will no longer be able to heal himself. Another method is to attack him to point of when he would heal, then using Subversion. The player can also choose to exterminate the Paladin before he can even attempt so heal, but this option is hardly viable as the Paladin's healing has zero cooldown duration, and the attempt itself will cost too much Health and Focus in response. While fighting the Paladin, the player should also ensure that he and Veradux are able to survive until the Paladin's Focus is depleted. His damage input is fairly high and he can also use Electro-Bolt to nullify the player's buff. It is thus advised that the player prepare some additional defensive abilities beforehand to counter the Paladin's attacks, all the while having the good balance of the offensive abilities to force the Paladin to heal. Alternatively, as a Gunslinger, having very high magic(~175) magic, using the combination 'Magic Bolt, Shatter Bolt, Magic Bolt, Magic Bolt' is almost guaranteed to kill the Paladin with very low damage being taken, even if you only put 1 point into those skills.Trivia Psychological  Psychological (German: Psychologisch) is a class in Sonny 2. Players that use the Psychological class use abilities that deal either Lightning or Shadow damage, using Instinct as almost their only co-efficient.\u00a0Only three Shadow abilities are based on Strength, namely Dark Infusion, Corruption\u00a0and Nerve Shock.Builds  The Psychological Ability Tree focuses on Shadow or Lightning abilities sans\u00a0two Physical,\u00a0ally-buffing skills, like Destruction\u00a0and Salvation,\u00a0which increase your teammates damage and healing outputs respectively.Shadow Tree (Psychopath)  The Shadow build focuses on lowering enemy defenses and maximizing the use of debuffs that give Damage-Over-Time (DOT). It is mostly indirect, and takes several turns to\u00a0deliver maximum damage output. Once at peak, however, it becomes threateningly high. Builds that focus on this tree are known in the community as \"shadow psycho\" builds.Lightning Tree (Wraith)  The Wraith is a notable contrast to that of the Psychopath; it centers on high and direct damage output and immediate Focus\u00a0regeneration. It is important however, to note that some of these skills consequentially empower opponents, giving them an opportunity to retaliate. Builds that focus on this tree are known in the community as \"shock\" or \"shocker psycho\" builds.Abilities Visual Map  Click on any icon in the ability tree to be taken to its page.  \u200bListing  Abilities are listed in chains based on their dependence.Ice Strike  Ice Strike is an A.I. exclusive ability in Sonny.Details  Deals damage to a target with 150% of the caster's Magic and Strength and places a buff on it for 3 turns.Buff  Cold Soul: This unit's Speed is lowered by 15%.Users Trivia Primary Arms (Sonny) Moon-Struck Horrors  \u00a0It is related to the Sun-Struck Horrors from SONNY 2.Piercing and Defense  Piercing and Defense are minor attributes in Sonny. Although they cannot be directly increased by leveling up, certain passive abilities, items, and buffs affect them. The different colors stand for different elements: red is Physical, pink is Magic or Cosmic, blue is Ice, orange is Fire, yellow is Lightning, brown is Earth, purple is Shadow, and green is Poison.Piercing  There are eight different types of Piercing, one for each element. Piercing increases the chance that an attack of its associated element will have a critical hit, and adds to the damage of any such attack. Note that piercing bonuses applied through skills affect critical chance, but do not add to the skill's base damage.Defense  There are eight different types of Defense, one for each element. Defense decreases the chance that an attack of its associated element will hit the user critically, and decreases the damage of any such attack.Elements  There are eight elements in Sonny, and every attack has an element. The element serves little purpose other than the calculations involving Piercing and Defense. Buffs also have an element, which may affect whether certain abilities can dispel them.  This is a very common element, and is the element of standard physical attacks. In every ability tree except the Psychological one, Physical skills are the most common.  The Magic element was commonly used in Sonny, although Sonny only had a few moves that used it. As of Sonny 2, the element was renamed Cosmic, and it only appears used by enemies, as Sonny doesn't have any ability using it.  The Ice element is a rather passive element, typically associated with spells that debuff the target, rather than dealing large amounts of damage. It is heavily associated with the Hydraulic class. In Sonny 1, Shatter Bolt was the only move available to Sonny with this element.  Despite being the antithesis of Ice, the Fire element is similar, although it is somewhat more active. Sonny had a few Fire skills in Sonny, but in Sonny 2, Sonny cannot deal fire damage, only other characters like Roald or ZPCI Elites can.  A moderately common element. Somewhat associated with Focus regeneration, used frequently by the Psychological class and includes Veradux's signature spell, Electro Bolt Med/Dux Electro. It focuses on immediate focus regeneration and high direct damage.  Earth is a rather rare element, as neither Sonny nor any of his allies has ever been able to use an Earth skill. In fact, only two skills scaling with Earth piercing currently exist: Sonny's Earth Smash and Sonny 2's Spire. No equipment has ever offered Earth Piercing, although the survivor's armor in Sonny 1 gives Earth Defense. The only 4 moves that use the earth element in Sonny 2 are the Mayor's enrage, Spire, Nostalgia's Earth Titan, and the Twin Guardian's Guardian Shield.  Shadow is the most common element in the Psychological tree, and tends to be associated with power at a price. The only offensive ability in the skill tree in Sonny that uses this element is Void. The Shadow element contains abilities with very low focus cost that tend to debuff the opponent. It is mostly indirect but once the opponent has been set up, its damage output becomes threateningly high  The Biological tree is the only one to contain any Poison spells. The skills tend to focus on damage over time rather than direct damage. In Sonny, equipping Galiant the Paladin's armor on Veradux would massively boost his Poison Piercing, allowing him to deal extreme damage with his Zombie Poison skill.  It is also possible to deal critical healing. Healing skills have elements just like Damage skills do, although this is not apparent in-game. Healing critical hits are not affected by the target's Defense.Ally Skills  The following table shows which skills belonging to each ally benefit from each type of piercing.Trivia  \u00a0Labyrinth  Labyrinth: Tunnel of Illusions is the fourth zone in Sonny 2. Its Zone bosses are The Hydra and two Fire Claws. Sonny, Roald, and Veradux are trapped in a series of tunnels known as the Labyrinth of Illusions after crashing the Ivory Line train. Covered in a green slime that makes humans indistinguishable from zombies, they go further into the tunnels, slowly succumbing to the effect of the hallucinogenic gases in the tunnel. They encounter all kinds of strange beasts and zombies. After defeating several monsters (it is unknown if these were hallucinations or actual enemies), they are rescued by a group of miners from the Hew and taken back to the miners' camp. The miners mistake them to be humans and provide clothing and helmets to save them from the toxic fumes.Training Fights  All training fights are 2 levels below Sonny\u00a0(Maximum 18).Shop  \"I'm fine, I'm fine! My nose is bleeding a little but I'll be alright. You need any more gear? I've got another suitcase of things for you to buy.\"Roaming Mode Text Trivia Biological  Biological (German: Biologisch) is a class in Sonny 2. It focuses on physical attacks to deal damage; therefore, its main co-efficients are strength and speed.Builds Physical tree (Predator)  Predators are very much like Assassin class of the original Sonny. They mainly focus their attributes into speed, and prefer dealing maximum instant damage with modest strength, buffed with a large critical chance due to high speed and physical piercing. Most of their attacks scale with their Strength and Speed. Because of this, are builds that focus on this tree are known in the community as \"speed bio\".Poison tree (Toxicant)  Toxicants have much higher health, resistance, and usually higher instinct than their Predator counterparts. Their abilities are more based on dealing high DOT. Toxicant attacks usually scales with two stat coefficients - The direct attack is generally based on INSTINCT+STRENGTH, with the DOT dealing STRENGTH damage. Builds that focus on this tree are known in the community as \"poison bio\". There is a mix of both Predators and Toxicants: the \"survival type\". This kind of way of fighting involves much higher health, and players usually employ it for helping their team mates. The Survivalist way of playing involves very developed, low level attacks and most healing abilities.Abilities Visual Map  Click on any icon in the ability tree to be taken to its page.Listing  Abilities are listed in chains based on their dependence.Roald  Roald is a playable character in Sonny 2. He is an Insurgent, and he joins your party after you complete stage 2 at Oberursel.Background  He is a human whom Sonny meets in the village of Oberursel. He and his fellow insurgents were rebelling against a violent cult in the village, which Sonny helps him to destroy. He was formerly a member of a group of researchers in the Utopia trying to find a cure for zombification. However, members of the group started disappearing: some were found dead, some were simply taken. In hindsight, it was likely the work of the ZPCI, but Roald and the others weren't aware of it at the time. Those that had survived fled from the Utopia to Oberursel. Unfortunately, it was not much better there; between the cult and the marauding zombies in the area, their lives were almost in as much danger at the village as they were in the Utopia. In Oberursel, Roald and another Insurgent chanced upon Sonny and Veradux, and briefly exchanged combat before realizing that they were not enemies. Sonny requests for a road to Utopia, and Roald counteroffers that if the two helped to take down the cult in the area, he would lead them to Utopia himself. Roald then joins the party.Battle  He has the same abilities both as an enemy and as an ally.Tactics Drops  Roald drops nothing, but after adding him to your party you can use his equipment.Trivia The Tape  The Tape is a major part of the main plot in Sonny and Sonny 2. It is given to Sonny by Louis the Blind, saying: \"It's a tape. Maybe it can help you.\"Part in Sonny  When Sonny gets off the White November he is looking for something to play the tape. He needs to fight his way through the Zone to hopefully find some way to play it. However, he never gets to actually play it in Sonny.Part in Sonny 2  The Tape is shown in the starting scene as the main plot device. Felicity steals the tape from Sonny and Veradux while they are sitting around a campfire and escapes into the nearby prison. They hurry after Felicity to get it back. They need to fight through the Zone 1 New Alcatraz to fight Felicity as the boss at the end of the Zone. Felicity commented that the tape is \"the key to Utopia\" before Sonny and Veradux engage in the fight with her. In a car they get to play the tape. It however only plays the song \"You are my Sunshine\" and does not explain anything. They have no other choice than to follow other leads for the time being. It is possible that when Felicity had The Tape in her possession, she switched it with the one that she threw to Sonny in the cut-scene at the end of Zone 1 in order to avoid giving him the actual tape. On the other hand, she may have been happy to hand over the real tape if she had already listened to it.Trivia Versu the Corruptor  Versu the Corruptor is an enemy from Sho'Tul Shelf in Sonny 2. It's allied with Orb of Restraint and Orb of Sanctuary. She is the final non-plot-related boss in Sonny 2.Tactics Psychological Biological Hydraulic Trivia Attributes  Attributes appear in Sonny and Sonny 2 and can affect a character in a wide variety of ways. These include effectiveness of abilities, life, piercing, accuracy, and evasiveness. Each attribute can be increased by equipping a character with an equipment, by applying Attribute points earned by leveling up, or by simply leveling up. In Sonny, you earn 1 Attribute point per level. In Sonny 2, you earn various amount of Attribute points per level. Re-spec can be used to redistribute Attribute points. In Sonny, you should take caution in using Re-spec. At the beginning of the game, two extra points are already given to both of Sonny's Strength and Speed regardless of class; using Re-spec will cause you to lose those extra points. In Sonny 2, using Re-spec will grant you 19 extra Attribute points to distribute regardless of class; this only happens once in each game. After each level up, the game grants you 4 attribute points that you can spend in\u00a0Sonny 2\u00a0. It's recommended to spend them when you level up.Vitality  Vitality determines the character's total health or life points. It is also used by some abilities. In Sonny, a character's health points are equal to 8 times their vitality points and in Sonny 2, it is 33 times.Strength  Strength has no passive effect. It acts as a co-efficient for certain abilities, normally melee-themed ones.Magic/Instinct Magic  Magic appears in Sonny and has no passive effect. It acts as a co-efficient for certain abilities, mostly magic-themed ones.Instinct  Instinct appears in Sonny 2 and entirely replaces the 'Magic' attribute seen in Sonny. The only difference between the two is their names.Speed  Speed determines the character's accuracy and evasiveness. It is a factor in determining the chance that the character will score a critical hit and provides a small damage increase, as all elemental piercings are passively increased by 50% of a unit's Speed. It is also a co-efficient in some abilities, such as Master Strike.Focus  Focus is a stat in Sonny and Sonny 2. It is used by most abilities, such as Smash, and scales with others, such as Demolish. Some items can increase and abilities can increase max focus, and some abilities can decrease max focus. Focus is the equivalent of MP (Magic Points) in most other RPGs, and is spent when Sonny uses a powerful offensive or defensive ability. Some abilities use no focus. Some abilities can decrease use of focus with each upgrade, and others can passively give Sonny Focus regeneration (such as Integrity).Piercing and Defense  There are a number of minor Piercings and Defenses attributes in the games.", "Marvel's Spider-Man Wiki": "Marvel's Spider-Man Wiki ", "SpongeBob Moves In Wiki": "SpongeBob Moves In Wiki ", "State of Decay Wiki": "State of Decay Wiki ", "Stranded Deep Wiki": "Stranded Deep Wiki ", "Street Fighter Wiki": "Street Fighter Wiki Characters  This is a list of characters from the Street Fighter fighting game series. It contains many characters, some of which originate from other series, and some of which have appeared in games outside this series. Here is a list of characters that have appeared with any capacity in the various Street Fighter games.Akuma  Akuma (\u60aa\u9b54, Akuma, \"Devil\"), known in Japan as Gouki (\u30b4\u30a6\u30ad(\u8c6a\u9b3c), G\u014dki, \"Fortitude\", \"Great Demon\", \"Great Devil\" or \"Great Ogre\"), is a video game character and recurring antagonist of the Street Fighter series, first appearing in Super Street Fighter II Turbo as a hidden boss. He is an emotionless and powerful warrior fixated on mastering the Satsui no Hado.Backstory Appearance  Akuma usually wears a dark-colored gi with the sleeves removed (similar to Ken and Ryu); it is often blue, black, or gray, but varies depending on the series or artwork. He has red hair, sharp, pointed teeth, and is often bare-footed, though some games have him wearing brown sandals. Depending on the game or piece of art, he either wears a black belt at his waist or a length of rope. Over his hands he either wears brown training gauntlets or wraps his hands with rope as well (again, depending on the source). He has tanned skin and crimson eyes, and wears his deceased master Goutetsu's prayer beads around his neck, with a visible black \"heaven\" (\u5929, ten) kanji on the center bead in some video games. In Street Fighter Alpha: Generations, he was seen having eyebrows when he was young. This kanji is featured frequently in Akuma's appearances, most often at the end of a Raging Demon attack, where it burns itself onto the back of Akuma's gi top. It takes on a slightly different shape between the original Street Fighter IV\u00a0and Super\u00a0Street Fighter IV; the top stroke of the kanji is more narrow in Super Street Fighter IV than in the original, and may have taken this shape due to Akuma's 2nd alternate costume using exactly the same new shape on the back. In his artwork for his Street Fighter V profile, Akuma's hair is completely white, and has grown out; he wears a dark yellow loincloth with a white sash on each side, going shirtless while retaining his gray karate pants. This is designed as a contrast to his older brother Gouken's outfit. In his full appearance in Street Fighter V, his hair has grown out considerably, resembling a lion's mane, though he retains his familiar clothing. He also has the hair on top of his head tied into a pigtail. He also wears his prayer beads like a sash. The \u795e\u4eba \"shin\" kanji used by Shin Akuma in Capcom vs. SNK 2 is seen on his back when performing the Shun Goku Satsu. His first alternate costume is similar to Ryu's alternate costume in Super Street Fighter IV; where his tattered karate gi is hanging loose on his waist and his karate pants are also in tatters. His second alternate costume is his outfit in Street Fighter V artwork and his third and last outfit is his classic appearance in the Street Fighter games. In the Street Fighter III series his hair is slightly grayed, hinting that Akuma, while seemingly inhuman, is still physically aging.Concept  Akuma's creation (and, indirectly, Gouken's) was inspired by an April Fools' joke published by the gaming magazine Electronic Gaming Monthly. Said hoax involved a \"secret trick\" for the original version of Street Fighter II that would allow players to fight Ryu and Ken's supposed master, Sheng Long (based on Ryu's mistranslated win quote.) Akuma's appearance resembles that of a Nio, one of a pair of guardians that symbolically protects Buddhist temples and other establishments against negative influences. Akuma's belligerence is a direct, and likely deliberate, contrast to the purpose of the Nio. Both Ibuki's and Yun's winquotes against him in Second Impact reference the Nio; Ibuki is reminded of the similarly-themed Shishi lions, while Yun jokingly attempts to recall if he saw Akuma at a temple before the match. For his guest appearance in Tekken 7: Fated Retribution, his unique stage is adorned with Nio statues in the background to reinforce his connection to them. His design may also borrow elements from another being of Buddhist origin, the Asura; Asura are demigod-like beings known for their indulgence in violence, and are cursed to live in a world of never-ending conflict. In SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos, Akuma and Shin Akuma make numerous references to the Asura in their intro battle dialogues. The rope garments he starts wearing from Street Fighter III onwards is possibly a reference to the Japanese gods who wear rope belts to keep their powers in check. It may be a nod to the fact that he handicaps himself in combat to give his opponents a fighting chance.Name Change  Capcom USA initially claimed Akuma was possessed by a demon, a detail that has not been reused since his first appearance; the character's name change from Gouki to Akuma for localization reflects Capcom USA's attempt to accentuate the demonic nature, as the word akuma (\u60aa\u9b54) means \"devil\" in Japanese. However, the appearance of Oni can be considered a revisiting of this, as he finally loses control of the 'demonic force' that is the Satsui no Hado in this form.Personality  Akuma is a cold and extremely powerful warrior whose sole reason for being is to hone his fighting skills by battling and destroying strong foes. He rarely displays any sign of emotions, aside from occasional bursts of anger, and rarely smiles. He takes his training very seriously and deals brutally with those who dare interrupt him, as seen in his Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike ending. Occasionally, he likes to test himself against worthy rivals (e.g. Gen, Oro). In later games, Akuma often refers to himself as a \"denizen of hell\" and \"evil incarnate\", and is seen as such by many. This may be a result of the Satsui no Hado (\"Surge of Murderous Intent\") taking a toll on his mind. In line with his martial arts philosophy, Akuma also believes in a certain principle of self-worth. Specifically, Akuma despises hubris (i.e. a perceived excess of self-worth), foolish behavior, and those who rely on means other than their fists to fight or gain power (both of which would indicate a lack of the same), as his various win quotes in the Street Fighter IV games indicate. He is also somewhat nihilistic by principle, as his search for worthy opponents often includes someone who would be able to kill him. Akuma detests his brother Gouken for not giving in to the dark side of their arts which is, according to Akuma, the way they were intended to be used. He also blames Gouken for sealing off the darkness within Ryu, thus preventing Ryu from reaching his true potential. This forces Akuma to give up on his planned duel with Ryu, as he believes that only a fellow practitioner of Satsui no Hado can one day hope to defeat him.Moral Code  Most of the time, Akuma abides by the code of the warrior. He fights to improve his skills and defeat powerful foes - though on rare occasion, he does so to gauge the other's abilities. Although he killed his teacher and believed he did the same with his brother (Gouken), Akuma did so in combat, and thus can be said to have not transgressed on his principles. In combat, Akuma almost never resorts to his true strength, especially if testing another fighter; he only fights warriors that he deems worthy, or the ones he believes have the potential to become such. During the events of Street Fighter Alpha 2, Akuma fought Ryu only to gain insight on Ryu's abilities, while in 3rd Strike, he faced Oro in order to test his own strength. Although Akuma usually prefers an even bout (as he backed out of a duel with Gen once he found out that Gen was fatally ill), it is not uncommon for him to deliver a lethal sneak attack to an unprepared opponent (as he did with Bison, Gill, and Adon's unnamed rival). While the evil nature of Satsui no Hado itself may have corrupted Akuma's ways, it is worth noting that Akuma considers Bison a much more abhorrent type of evil. His win quotes in 3rd Strike also imply Akuma has become much bloodthirstier and perhaps may have discarded his moral code, very much like Evil Ryu; it is possible that at this point, the Satsui no Hado's hold on Akuma has strengthened, being close to completely overtaking his mind and body, and that said win quotes reflect this state.Relationships  Due to his single-minded quest for strength, he has made enemies over time, though he actively does not seek to antagonize without provocation. Surprisingly, there are a few personalities that he has a vague sense of respect for.Enemies Gouken  Akuma is Gouken's younger brother and nemesis. Gouken greatly despises him for embracing the Satsui no Hado and murdering Goutetsu. Because of this, he does all he can to protect Ryu and Ken from him, to the point where he willingly fought Akuma in a battle to the death so that he won't come after them.Ryu  Akuma is one of Ryu's most hated enemies, as he was the one who tried to kill his master, Gouken. Akuma also attempts to lure Ryu into succumbing to the Satsui no Hado, therefore casting aside his humanity, in hopes of finally finding a worthy opponent for the ultimate fight to the death that he seeks. Ryu knows this is a trap of temptation planned by Akuma, as Ryu has tried his best to find a way to get rid of the Satsui no Hado while refusing to succumb to that kind of power. Akuma ceases tempting him (or at the least, respects his choice) after finally conquering the dark power and mastering his own Hado power in Street Fighter V.Ken  Like Ryu, Ken is aware of the threat Akuma possesses over humanity.Adon  Because Akuma killed a Muay Thai master that Adon was supposed to fight, he seeks to defeat him to prove himself. In Alpha 3, he finds him and loses to him. Akuma doesn't kill him, however, due to him deeming Adon unworthy of death.Gen  Gen saw Akuma as a skilled opponent who could finally kill him, a morbid desire amplified by his own terminal sickness. However, their skills often clash, giving each other challenges. Akuma however backed down upon learning Gen is fatally ill, but would engage him again after seeing he can still fight. Akuma emerges victorious and is implied to have killed him for good in Street Fighter V in their last fight to the death.M. Bison  Akuma has no particular grudge against Bison apart from being an even more abhorrent kind of evil using shortcuts to power. Because of this, he has no problem killing him on a whim. Bison on the other hand wants Akuma's Satsui no Hado as a means to increase his own power. His disdain for Bison persists even when he becomes Oni.Oro  Oro is among one of the only men who have matched Akuma in combat. The two have fought each other to a draw, as the fight was called off due to the two fighters sensing that if they fought each other seriously, it would result in a mutual kill. Both have earned each other's respect and contempt on a personal basis.Gill  Upon hearing about his powers, Akuma desired to fight Gill. Akuma killed Gill with the Raging Demon, but left without realizing that Gill could resurrect himself.Kazuya Mishima  Kazumi's son, corrupted by his own Devil Gene inherited by her. Akuma is tasked by Kazumi in destroying him to prevent his malevolent power from growing and becoming a proper threat. Akuma fights Kazuya at G Corporation Tower and pushes him to transform, but the fight was unsettled as Heihachi blew up the tower with a satellite laser in an attempt to end Kazuya and Akuma's lives. However, Akuma is revealed to have survived and tries to terminate Kazuya again after his victory against Heihachi in a post-story bonus chapter. Upon seeing him, Kazuya transforms into his Devil form again and Akuma answers by becoming Shin Akuma. The fight ends in a cutscene where both fire their respective projectiles to each other. The outcome of the battle is left unknown as the volcano bursts with lava.Heihachi Mishima  Kazumi's husband, whose ambition has caused a plethora of problems. Akuma is also tasked by Kazumi to destroy him as well, but fought together momentarily against Kazuya's Jack-6s. He waited for Heihachi to establish his own strength before engaging in him, one of many instances of his moral code being followed. Heihachi proved to be a challenge for Akuma but he ultimately defeated him as he blew up the Mishima dojo. Later revealed Heihachi actually survived, buried under his own dojo. This allowed him to fake his death and reveal Kazuya's Devil form to the world and got revenge on Akuma by attempting to kill him with a satellite laser while he was battling Devil Kazuya on the G Corporation tower.Asura  Asura is perhaps Akuma's greatest rival. After Asura defeated Ryu, he then fought Akuma for over 500 years.Necalli  Necalli is an ancient spirit that seeks to devour Akuma's soul. When Necalli successfully absorbs it, Akuma escapes his stomach using the Mudo Tensho.Neutral-to-Friendly Elena  Thus far, the only one that has given Akuma the first-ever smiling face, though whether it is a genuine smile remains debatable.Goutetsu  Akuma's master, who trained both him and his brother in the martial arts of Ansatsuken. He left their dojo to refine his killing technique in the Satsui no Hado. He also did not agree to the concept of balance between light and dark, and wanted to use the martial art the way it was originally intended. Akuma then challenged Goutetsu to a fight to the death, which pushed him to turn into Shin Akuma for the first and only time in the canon series. Akuma came out victorious by killing his master with the Raging Demon, and took his signature prayer beads and placed them on his neck. It should be noted Akuma and Goutetsu's fight had no hostility and hatred, very similar to Guy and Zeku's fight; Akuma, while disagreeing to his concept of balance between dark and light, wanted to show his master the fruits of his labor, while Goutetsu died a proud and happy teacher, knowing his student has mastered the technique.Kazumi Mishima  Kazumi saved Akuma from an unspecified circumstance sometime before the Tekken storyline began. In return, Akuma promised to carry out Kazumi's request of killing Kazuya and Heihachi due to being corrupted by their own power. However, it is not known if Akuma was aware of Kazumi's own devil gene or the malevolent traits of her own maiden family. He presumably was not, as even he was taken aback by Kazuya's Devil transformation.Story Martial arts career and killing his master and brother Pre-Alpha  Akuma and his brother Gouken were students of Goutetsu. Goutetsu taught a nameless life-threatening martial art, which incorporates elements of Karate, Judo, and Kempo. He also taught the Shun Goku Satsu (literally Instant Hell Murder), a lethal technique which, although incredibly powerful, puts the user in considerable danger. As the brothers progressed under Goutetsu's tutelage, a dispute arose on the true nature of their fighting style and the path to master it. Gouken, unable to accept the violent nature and the Satsui no Hado of his fighting style, left Goutetsu to begin his own dojo, which Goutetsu did not oppose. Akuma continued Goutetsu's teachings, and vowed to use their fighting style as it was intended. In order to learn Shun Goku Satsu, Akuma embraced the principle of Satsui no Hado, and was forced to give up any compassion he held towards other human beings. In addition, Akuma realized his limits as a martial artist could be expanded, and left Goutetsu's guidance of enlightenment to train alone to gain more power. However, due to embracing the Satsui no Hado to its fullest extent, he developed a lust to fight to the death, unlike Goutetsu, who had been able to use the Satsui no Hado without giving in to its dark side. After coming back from his island, Akuma went back to Goutetsu, and fought him in a death match to prove that he had surpassed him. Akuma killed his master\u00a0with the Shun Goku Satsu, who died happy to see his student surpass him,\u00a0and Akuma, believing that he was the true master of the Art, took the prayer beads of his dead master and placed it on his neck. Gouken came to visit his former master to see how he was doing, only to find his lifeless body and his brother, now no longer human. Gouken, shocked to see that his younger brother took the life of their master, berated Akuma, who said nothing and left for the woods. Many years later, Akuma fought Gouken, while the then-young duo of Ryu and Ken watched. Akuma told Gouken that he was not strong enough to face him without giving in the killing intent; Gouken retorted that the art was much more than just death and destruction, accusing Akuma of dishonoring their master's name. Akuma told his brother that Goutetsu did not truly understand the art, and that he was a fool for not using the Satsui no Hado to its fullest extent. The fight continued, and Gouken won. Akuma told his brother to kill him, but Gouken had no intention of murdering his own kin, prompting Akuma to call him weak for sparing the life of a strong opponent and declare that he would return. A couple of years later, Akuma came back to Gouken's dojo and fought him in battle, using the Shun Goku Satsu on him. Akuma believed him dead, not knowing that Gouken had somehow lived through the attack by emptying his soul, and was only in a coma. Ken saw the flash of the attack while running to the dojo, but arrived only to find Gouken on the floor. Knowing who was behind this, Ken confronted Akuma in the woods and fought him, only to be defeated. After defeating Ken, Akuma disappeared without a trace.First World Warrior Tournament and fighting Gen, Ryu and Bison Main Articles: Street Fighter Alpha, Street Fighter Alpha 2 and Street Fighter Alpha 3  Akuma only appears as a secret character only playable via random fighter at the character selection screen. He shares his moveset with Ryu and Ken. An artwork shows that, at some point, he helps a child who got lost in his cave. In his retconned ending, he defeats Bison claiming his quest was complete, though he feels empty. Gouken is seen in the background of his ending, as one of the people who fear and oppose him. Akuma begins to search the globe looking for worthy fighters to challenge. Secluding himself in the shadows, he watches small tournaments and street fights, desperately seeking someone who might be able to match his strength. He is eventually challenged by a man named Gen. Gen fights a vicious battle, even surviving the Shun Goku Satsu by emptying his soul in time. Just as Akuma begins to wonder whether this man is the worthy opponent he's searching for, he begins to sense not all is as it seems. When Gen's mouth begins to bleed, Akuma's suspicions are confirmed: his opponent is sick, and the fight is not fair. After being knocked to the ground, Gen tells Akuma to kill him. Not wanting to carry the fight on any longer, Akuma leaves, infuriating Gen. After the fight, Akuma becomes obsessed with Ryu, hoping to awaken the Satsui no Hado within his prey. Ryu eventually finds Akuma's island (known as Onigami Isle or the Gokuentou) and challenges him. The intense battle ended with Ryu gaining the upper hand; in truth, Akuma was only testing him. Akuma regains composure and tells Ryu to find him again when he has embraced the Satsui no Hado, before striking the ground with a powerful blow and disappearing. The island falls apart around Ryu, who is left in the ocean to contemplate Akuma's words. Leaving his destroyed abode, Akuma thinks about all the fighters he has encountered, and wonders with excitement if one day he will fight someone strong enough to kill him in battle. This thought drives him on; finding a desolate cavern (also known as Kiga Cave), he begins to train anew and await the day when he will fight Ryu again. At some point, he defeats and kills a Muay Thai fighter who was about to challenge the champion, Adon. Adon sees this as a challenge and sets out to find Akuma, to fight him and prove that he is stronger. In his ending, he comes to the realization that worthy opponents have challenged him during his journey. He decides that he could stay on Earth to perfect his killing power, knowing that there are opponents that Akuma can consider worthy. While thinking about the opponents he challenged, there are visions of Gen, M. Bison and Ryu on the moon. He then comments that he will be the next to die. While waiting for Ryu to embrace the Satsui no Hado, Akuma wanders the globe in search of worthy opposition. He is confronted by Adon, who wishes to establish his fighting style as supreme. Akuma easily wins but, instead of killing Adon, he just leaves, apparently deeming his defeated foe as unworthy. Sometime later, Akuma is intercepted by Guy, who refuses to allow him to see M.Bison; Akuma ignores Guy's pleas and engages him in combat, the two than decided to end the fight after they realized their primary objective was the same: defeat M.Bison. He then confronts Bison,\u00a0who tells Akuma that he won't be able to defeat him as long as the Psycho Drive exists. Akuma berates the dictator for not relying solely upon his fists, and they fight. As Akuma emerges victorious, he completely terminates Bison with the Raging Demon, causing him to suffer horribly as\u00a0the attack\u00a0kills him. In his ending, Akuma\u00a0is then challenged by\u00a0Gen once more and they\u00a0fight a second battle, the results of which are unknown. Unbeknownst to Akuma, Ryu rejected the Satsui no Hado during his own battle with the Shadaloo leader, M. Bison, declaring that a true warrior does not rely on violent intent.Second World Warrior Tournament and waiting for a worthy opponent Main Article:Super Street Fighter II Turbo  Akuma did not officially enter the second World Warrior tournament, but did monitor the events that took place during it in hope of finding an adequate challenge. He also challenged Bison, though whether or not Bison accepted this challenge, and if the result of the fight if the former did happen is left ambiguous. Akuma then left as multiple participants engage Bison. In a retconned and non-canon event, he ambushed the host, M. Bison, and made short work of him with the Shun Goku Satsu. Bison is obliterated in an instant. Akuma then engages in combat with the second finalist, but the identity of this warrior, as well as the outcome of the bout, remains unknown. In both the original Super Street Fighter II Turbo and its HD remake, Akuma has two different endings, depending on who the final opponent is. If it is M. Bison, Akuma will muse on the fact that he did not master the Psycho Power and let it control him. If it is Shin Akuma, he will reflect on his victory over his own darkness, and consider death beneath him. Super Street Fighter II Turbo Revival combines both endings into a whole one, while Ultra removes the second ending, thus causing the first ending to always play regardless if Akuma beats M. Bison or Shin Akuma.Street Fighter IV series  Sometime before the third World Warrior Tournament, Ryu and Akuma would duel, with Akuma dominating the fight, as he rebukes Ryu about his rejection of the Dark Hado, Ryu finds the strength to recover and fight back. However, Ken would interrupt the fight, forcing Akuma to leave. During the events of Seth's tournament, he continues his training, and senses the Satsui no Hado reemerging within Ryu. Immediately, he sets off to find Ryu and help him realize this power so he can try to kill him in battle. Like the other tournaments, Akuma does not officially enter, but stays in the shadows. Later, he finds an unconscious Ryu in the care of his brother Gouken. Akuma noticed that his brother has perfected the Power of Nothingness. The two brothers fought, with Ryu being the prize. Both survived their fight, and Ryu was saved by Gouken. Akuma then continued his training and his search for a worthy opponent to match his own, razing an entire forest with his power. In Elena's ending in Ultra Street Fighter IV, she is shown to have befriended him in one of her flashbacks.Street Fighter V  Akuma is revealed to be the first of the second wave of the DLC characters and his teaser has revealed on the Capcom Cup 2016 trailer on November 7, 2016 where he was briefly seen performing the Raging Demon and the kanji burned mark \"heaven\" on his back has been replaced with a \"godlike person\" mark. Akuma's reveal trailer has been released on December 4, 2016 where he was seen fighting against Ryu and later became playable in December 20, 2016. His hair is now longer, and more like a lion's mane. Prologue - 'Mudo Tensho' In Akuma's story, he and Gen fight once again. Akuma becomes victorious in the battle, but was criticized by Gen for leading to the path of discarding humanity. He then finishes and seemingly kills Gen off for good. He then sees a vision of Ryu rejecting the Satsui no Hado, much to his frustration. Necalli appears and challenges Akuma for his soul. Not only did Necalli lose to Akuma, but he attempts to devour Akuma and\u00a0Akuma does the Mudo Tensho to escape Necalli's stomach. He then seeks Ryu and battles him, in a Satsui no Hado Vs. Mu no Ken clash. Akuma defeats Ryu in battle, but does not kill him. Instead, he questions if there is no one that can match him. Ryu, smiling while laying on the ground, asks questions to Akuma, claiming that his fists will continue to communicate with Akuma on opposite ends. Akuma then flees, letting fate determine when those two will meet again.Street Fighter III: 2nd Impact  As with the third World Warrior tournament, Akuma did not enter the fourth World Warrior tournament, but once more lurked in the shadows. He was challenged by Sean who mistook him for Ryu, only for Akuma to beat him easily. He successfully pulled off a Shun Goku Satsu on the tournament sponsor Gill, although he left without realizing that Gill had resurrected himself. He then faces Ryu, asking him to show him his full power, but Ryu replies that malicious intent is not the way of the warrior. In this game, he appears as a secret boss. Using the Raging Demon on whoever the player is facing, he battles the player afterwards. If Akuma is felled, the scenery will darken, the ground will shake and he will get back up and unleash his true power for a second fight. Over this time-span, Akuma had trained relentlessly, harnessing his power and learning several new techniques; some were meant to create tidal waves, others were described as strong enough to split Uluru (Ayers Rock) in half, and one could kill an opponent with a single strike. One such self-taught technique is called the Kongou Kokuretsuzan, in which Akuma channels all his power into one hand and smashes it into the ground, creating a vortex of energy upward around him. It is supposedly this technique that was used to destroy his original training ground, the Onigami Isle Gokuentou. The same technique is also said to have the power to make the Earth itself crumble beneath him.Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike  Akuma continued to develop his now-incredible fighting skill, and even fought with Oro in a simple, inconclusive battle, with each other sensing the other's massive chi and testing their powers. Though mutually impressed by each other's power, both men expressed some contempt for the other on a personal basis. It is also revealed that Akuma has now demonstrated the ability to remain underwater under massive pressure for extended periods of time, and has even managed to make his Tenshou Kaireki Jin technique powerful enough to destroy the massive sunken ruins of a modern liner ship.Crossover appearances Cyberbots: Fullmetal Madness  In Cyberbots Fullmetal Madness releashed only in Japan, Akuma is a playable character but as giant mecha Z-Akuma or Z-Gouki (Zero-Akuma or Zero Gouki for short). This incarnation is significant in that its Raging Demon is fully visible to the player.SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos  Akuma's ending in the storyline depends on his final opponent; if Akuma faced Athena, his ending shows him ascending to the Heavens. As he has not found a worthy foe on the mortal plane of existence, he proceeds to challenge God himself, although he is surprised to find him in the form of an old man, drinking tea in his living room. If Akuma's final opponent was Red Arremer, his ending shows him using a variation of the Kongou Kokuretsuzan to create a massive fissure on the earth, and leaps in to the depths of Hell, defeating all of the denizens and eventually reaching and defeating Astaroth from the Ghosts n' Goblins series.SNK vs. Capcom: The Match of the Millennium  He appears in this game as a secret character, and rival to Iori Yagami. A supposed clone of him appears as one of Geese Howard and M. Bison's guards along with clones of Morrigan and Zangief. In his ending, after Billy Kane is defeated by Iori, he says to Akuma he will take care of him once he kills Kyo Kusanagi before leaving. Akuma replies he'll be waiting; confident that Iori's Riot of the Blood is no match for his Satsui no Hado.Capcom vs. SNK  He appears as a secret final boss. On the Capcom Groove, if the player as accumulated enough points, the player will first think they are fighting M. Bison, only for Akuma to kill Bison in a surprise attack. He then challenges the player.Capcom vs. SNK 2  Akuma appears as a boss. He is shown on a roof in Osaka fighting Rugal if the player has a high enough score, and defeated the Last Stage's opponent(s) with a Super Combo Finish If it is normal Akuma, he will appear by himself, wondering who emitted a great war cry. Akuma then deducts that it was the player's character/team, and proceeds to challenge them directly. When he is defeated, he states that he will never give up, and then says that a real challenger has appeared at last, which is none other than Rugal himself, and the two proceed to battle at once. If he is the one speaking to Rugal on the roof, he states that\u00a0he will remember\u00a0Rugal's name, and performs the Shun Goku Satsu on Rugal. However, Rugal then grabs Akuma by the chest, commenting on how much the Satsui no Hado impressed him, and forcibly gives the Orochi power to Akuma before his death. He will then transform into Shin Akuma (also known as God Akuma in this game, due to the different kanji that appears on his back. If defeated, he is left clinging to life, until black entities revive him and take him away, ordering him to go on and become stronger. However, if Rugal is the one speaking to Akuma, he states that he enjoyed the Satsui no Hado, and comments that Akuma is not worthy of it. Deciding that it requires a new possessor, he then kills Akuma outright, and absorbs his Satsui no Hado to become Ultimate Rugal. However, Akuma takes possession of Rugal's body, as his mind isn't strong enough to contain his power. He then dissapears after Rugal's defeat, stating he has no name, and is 'nothing and everything'. If the game is cleared with Akuma, the following text scrolls: \"Though he has beat the Evil Powers, Akuma isn't satisfied. He is not satisfied by power, energy, or victories. Nobody can realise what Akuma longs for...\"Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix  In his prologue, Akuma leaves his island, Gokuentou, because it is overrun by tourists, and the place is becoming an exclusive leisure resort. Traveling by boat with his belongings, he searches for a new training ground. In his ending, he defeated Hsien-ko after she had promised to lead him to the perfect place to train. After Hsien-ko berates Akuma if anyone ever taught him to hold back his punches, she keeps her promise, leading him deep within a forest to an area where zombies dwell at night. Akuma accepts this as his new training ground, seeing them as the perfect targets to brush up his killing techniques, and engages the zombies as he continues his quest to become the world's mightiest warrior.Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds  Akuma appears as one of the four characters working alongside Galactus as his Heralds, though his motivation is the same as in most appearances. In his ending, he is shown to have defeated Galactus as well as many others from the \"other dimension\" that stood in his path. Seeing as how the \"Planet Eater\" himself could not defeat him, Akuma decides not to wait for strong opponents to appear, but rather to seek them out. in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, he also appears in Dormammu's ending, as one of the Capcom villains opposing the dimensional overlord's advances on the Capcom universe. He also shows up in Ryu's ending where Ryu, who has recently been appointed as Iron Fist's successor, defeats him.Street Fighter X Tekken  He appears in one of the trailers of the game, where he confronts Ogre while the meteorite falls, calling him a \"pathetic whelp\". The places they are standing on elevates in the air during the crash. At the end, they both charge at each other. Akuma appears in Street Fighter X Tekken as a playable character and as one of the final bosses, with his Tekken counterpart being Ogre. In his story, he senses the meteorite before it actually comes crashing into the Antarctic. When it finally impacts, he reappears at the Antarctic, seeing the Pandora as a \"new era of chaos\" as fighters from all over the world are gathering together to find it. His Swap Costume is Heihachi Mishima's infamous outfit from Tekken 4. In his boss cutscene, Pandora is seen for a few seconds, and then the camera pans out, showing Akuma descending to the ground from the sky from an unknown location. He then lands while punching the ground in the process, creating huge pillars of snow. Akuma then walks towards the player's characters menacingly, declaring that he will bring a new era of chaos with his fists, and then the fight begins. In his rival cutscene, Ogre appears before him and Akuma calls him \"pitiful creature\" and tells him to prove his worth. Ogre launches a wave scream that Akuma completely shrugs off before taking his fighting stance. The fight then begins. In Ogre's rival cutscene, before he gets to the box, Akuma sends him a Zanku Hadoken that he stops but gets pushed back in the process. The fight then begins. In his ending, Akuma approaches Pandora, but when it opens, it manifests a Pandora version of Oni before him. Recognizing this form as a raging shadow of himself, he moves in to attack. He also appears in Steve and Hwoarang's ending, where Pandora spawns 100 Akumas (1 Akuma and 99 Shin Akumas) in response to Hwoarang's overconfidence, all of them attacking at once with the Raging Demon. In his epilogue, Akuma engaging Pandora Oni causes a storm that lasts several days. All organizations seeking the box are forced to return home due to the storm. But as they leave, a huge crack running along the ground swallows the box. Eyewitness claim to have seen a human-like creature in the middle of the storm but it was dismissed as an ephemeral mass of energy. To the outside, those events still remain a mystery.Asura's Wrath  Akuma, along with Ryu, both made appearances in Capcom and CyberConnect2's collaborative beat-'em-up title, Asura's Wrath. Akuma appears as a DLC-only character with his own fleshed out episode, titled The Strongest vs. The Angriest. Much like Ryu's episode, it uses the Super Street Fighter IV engine while shifting to the traditional battle system for the second half. The story picks up after Ryu's episode, where Akuma suddenly appears. To prevent distractions, Akuma immediately executes the Demon Armageddon on Ryu, but instead of piercing him, he launches him so hard it forces Ryu through a wormhole back to his original timeline. When Akuma learns of Asura's name, he reveals himself to be familiar with the deity's background as a being of wrath and challenges him. Akuma retains his moves from Super Street Fighter IV, and switches Ultras between matches. The Wrath of the Raging Demon can be countered through a Quick Time Event. At the end of the first half, he transforms into Oni, starting the second half. At the end of the battle, Asura and Akuma (reverting from Oni somehow) continue to fight, with the fight apparently lasting for 500 years. In the timeskip, both combatants are still facing each other in a standstill and have turned to stone with developing moss. Eventually, both statues begin to move at last to finally finish the fight, ending in a cliffhanger.Street Fighter \u00d7 Mega Man  Akuma is one of two hidden bosses of Street Fighter \u00d7 Mega Man. To face him, the player must have 4 or more perfect wins over the previous eight bosses. When the player faces M. Bison, Akuma will appear, performing a Misogi on him and sending Mega Man to his stage for the final boss fight.Tekken 7  At the 2015 \"King of Iron Fist\" Tekken 7 tournament, Tekken series executive producer Katsuhiro Harada announced that Akuma is officially included in Tekken 7's \"Fated Retribution\" update.\u00a0 In the game's debut trailer, he is called upon by Heihachi Mishima's estranged wife, Kazumi, to kill Heihachi, and also her son Kazuya, after he's gone too far on his ambition for absolute power. This later reveals in Story Mode that she was talking to him after recovering from a \"fever\" and attacking her husband, Heihachi in her devil form while trying to tend her sickness. Akuma has standing debt between him and Kazumi and she was responsible for saving him for unexplained reasons. Sometime after Heihachi reclaimed the Mishima Zaibatsu, Akuma confronted him at the Mishima dojo, but their battle was interrupted by a Jack-6 army sent by Kazuya. The two of them temporarily joined forces to defeat the onslaught of robots. Afterwards, Akuma introduced himself to Heihachi and explained that he was sent by the late Kazumi to kill both her husband and son. Upon asked by Heihachi about why he waited so long to fulfill the promise, Akuma replied that he was waiting until Heihachi had become stronger. Emerging victorious, Akuma seemingly killed Heihachi and destroyed the Mishima dojo. He later goes to the top of G Corporation tower to fight and kill Kazuya. Gaining the upper hand in the fight, Akuma forced Kazuya into a corner, prompting him to transform into Devil. However, before there was a victor, their fight was interrupted by Heihachi, who had survived and faked his death. The Mishima Zaibatsu CEO fired a power laser from a space satellite, destroying G Corporation tower. Akuma survived the attack, and confronted Kazuya once more in the volcanic pit after Kazuya killed Heihachi. With his opponent quickly transforms to his devil form, Akuma found himself locked in an intense fight. The battle reached its climax when Akuma fired a Hadoken at Kazuya's laser attack, destroying the volcanic surroundings. The final outcome of the fight is unknown. Akuma retains the core elements of his fighting style in Tekken 7: Fated Retribution (Gohadoken, Shakunetsu Hadoken, Zanku Hadoken, Gou Shoryuken, Tatsumaki Zankukyaku, and Ashura Senku). The Shin Shun Goku Satsu also appears as his Rage Art. During his victory sequence, he slams his palm into the ground similar to the Kongou Kokuretsuzan. Unlike other characters in the Tekken franchise, some of Akuma's moves like his special moves are governed by an EX/Super meter similar to his native series (although it is separated into two segments as opposed to four) and the Messatsu Gou Hadou is his Super move in place on Rage Attack. His Power Crush attack mimics the animation of his Focus Attack from Street Fighter IV, as they serve similar functions in each game. In Arcade Mode of Tekken 7: Fated Retribution, Akuma serves as the secret final boss of the game instead of Kazumi. When the player defeats him, Akuma glows in purple miasma due to the power of the Satsui no Hado is getting out of control and he unleashes his massive power in a flash of light before the start of the credits. In the Kiwami Campaign event when all of the Tekken characters gain their costumes for their customization, Akuma's own costume from one of his customizations is one of his disguised forms in Pocket Fighter. He also gains his Swap Costume in Street Fighter X Tekken as part of his customization but without his footwraps and the white streaks on his hair.Tekken (Mobile)  Akuma became a playable guest character in the update in Tekken (Mobile) on May 1, 2018 as his teaser trailer showcasing Akuma to demonstrate his fighting techniques against Jin Kazama as the last scene of the trailer shows both of them clashed with their Rage Arts in whoever gets hit first. His main appearance is from his crossover appearances in the games as both his 1-Star up to his 4-Star appearances is a reference to the color pallete change when the player would choose any characters in the Street Fighter main games. His featured act is the Demon's Path is a reference to his role in the main games for taking a path of a demon. His demon path was later shared by Street Fighter EX series and Fighting EX Layer character, Kairi who also utilizes his moveset (excluding his Shinki Hatsudo). In every modes, this will gain some bronze, silver, gold and crystal Akuma tokens to gain 1 to 3 pieces of 1-Star to 4-Star fragments in order to unlock him.Power Rangers Legacy Wars  Akuma is a playable character in this game. As Rita Repulsa's hold on the Morphin Grid stretches across multiverses, Akuma is among the warriors who are sucked into the Grid, pitted against those from the Power Rangers multiverse.Animation and movies Street Fighter Alpha: The Animation  Akuma first appears in Ryu's mind when Ryu is suddenly overcome by the energy of the Satsui no Hado for a short time with Akuma telling him to \"open his eyes to the Evil Hado\". He reappears later when Ryu and Chun-Li visit his island, in the middle of a field of wooden statues. He says that \"the true fighter must walk into the arena with all his powers at the ready\" and if Ryu is a pupil of Gouken, he must walk the same path as him and fight him with his true power or leave. His own Dark Hado influences Ryu's, the latter struggling against it. However Ryu only asks a question: If he has a family or a son, to which Akuma responds \"When I walk, I walk alone, when I fight, I fight alone\" before walking away. In the movie's ending, he reappears to fight Ryu who seeks to prove he is nothing like him, much to Akuma's dismay. The movie ends with them both charging at each other.Street Fighter Alpha: Generations  This movie gives Akuma a more personal backstory; he is also called Gouki. He is lying against a tree and is woken up by Sayaka, Goutetsu's daughter. Gouken tells him that he had no choice since Gouki used the Dark Hado when his master forbid it while Sayaka tends to his wounds. During sunset, he has an argument with Goutetsu at the dojo which Sayaka eavesdrop, asking why he forbids the Dark Hado and his master answering that he cannot use it. Gouki responds by saying that he does not want to follow a laid out path like his predecessors' teachings are absolute. He also says that a true martial arts master will have the courage to follow a thorny trail to which Goutetsu responds that what Gouki is describing is not courage but arrogance. He then leaves the room, followed angrily by his pupil who finds Sayaka eavesdropping. She tells him that although it's hard to believe, her father wants what's best for him. Gouki replies that he knows that but wanted his master to understand that he had his own path to follow. But as he leaves, he start to cramp up again but tells Sayaka to stay away when she tries to help him before walking away. He is seen again in the evening, in the process of transforming into a demon while Goutetsu confronts him, saying that seeing him like this was a great dissapointment. Then starts a battle of cataclysmic proportions between the two. During that time, Gouken and Sayaka rush to the scene but Sayaka stops and shows nausea, implying that Gouki impregnated her. When Gouken gets there, Gouki defeated Goutetsu with the Shun Goku Satsu. Gouken then berates his brother for this act and tells him that his happiness was right there within his reach and yells for an answer. But Gouki just takes his master's prayer beads and walks away without saying anything. He appears again in the present day in Ryu's memories. In their first meeting, and the day where he came to the dojo to kill Gouken, causing Ryu's Satsui no Hado to awaken. He reappears in the flesh at the climax of the movie where he fights Ryu. Gouki completely dominates the bout, while saying to Gouken that he was right to walk down this path and the fact that Ryu is here proves it. Cornered, Ryu gives in to the Satsui no Hado and manages to actually hurt Gouki, much to the latter's excitement. Their fight calls the spirits of former Satsui users from Ryu and Gouki's bloodline. But as they trade punches, Ryu sees a vision of Fuuka which causes him to stop using the Dark Hado. Gouki scolds Ryu, saying to him that his path to a great warrior had been clouded and that through his teachings, he has forsaken his natural thirst to be strong to which Ryu replies that on the contrary, it made him strong, angering Gouki. Ryu tries to attack from above while Gouki sends a Messatsu Gou Hadou. Gouki's attack connects but Ryu strikes his chest with his Hado which results in purifying the entire forest along with the spirits in a light blue explosion. Gouki's chest becomes clearer due to this and he walks away with visions of Gouken and Sayaka treating his wounds. After this, Gouki gets back up saying \"My name is Gouki! The one who became strong! Someday, someday I intend to fight you again\" to Ryu. As he says this, his eyes and appearance returned to human-looking, probably due to Ryu's attack making him momentarily regain part of his humanity. During this time, the monk's speech to Ken implies that Gouki is Ryu's father. However, this entire movie is non-canon.Street Fighter IV: The Ties That Bind  Akuma appears in the beginning of the movie, where he enters Ryu's mind and torments him. He inquires about why and how long Ryu intends to resist the Satsui no Hado to which he responds \"Until my last breath!\" and that he aims for something higher than power. But Akuma dismisses this as foolishness of the highest order, given that Ryu doesn't know exactly what he seeks. Akuma goes on by saying that Ryu's blood is calling out to him and that he must answer it with his life. But Ryu keeps refusing sternly, prompting Akuma to tell him that he will murder him himself and states that this mundane world is of no concern to them as they grow stronger by consuming human life. Having had enough, Ryu tells him off by unconsciously using the Satsui no Hado, causing Akuma to burst in laughter before vanishing.Other Appearances Street Fighter (UDON)  In the UDON comics, Akuma's storyline is alternate universe story then in the video games; however, it does provide a few interesting twists. Akuma is still presented as one of the mightiest characters in the Street Fighter, though a few fighters were shown being capable of taking him out or at least able to stand their ground against him. Gouken has managed to defeat Akuma the first time he appeared to challenge his brother. However, the second time around, he was not so lucky, as the Satsui no Hado-fueled Akuma proved to be too powerful. Gen is also one of the selected few that managed to repeat Gouken's feat; in a duel where fighters both powered by the Satsui no Hado, Gen's experience proved to be a deciding factor as he struck down Akuma with one of his deadliest techniques. Akuma survives, but is badly injured and at Gen's mercy. Intrigued by the level of skill displayed by his opponent, Gen spares his life and agrees to a rematch once Akuma has fully mastered the Dark Hado. This event causes Akuma to grow an utmost respect for Gen's fighting abilities. Their second bout, however, is in the shadow of Gen's illness, and after a single, deadly clash, Akuma and Gen forever part their ways while paying respect to each other. Soon afterwards, as a result of this brief encounter, Gen collapses and dies. In the World Warrior tournament's finals, Akuma faces M. Bison, but neither is able to gain the upper hand until the Psycho Drive, the device that powers Bison, is destroyed by other street fighters. In the true final battle, Akuma is defeated by a Satsui no Hado-consumed Ryu, who manages to regain his senses in time to spare Akuma's life, refusing to dishonor the memory of his late master by giving in to the darkness. Enraged, Akuma is then apparently stopped by Gouken; however, Gouken's appearance can be attributed to Ryu having hallucinations caused by the smoke and toxic vapors, courtesy of Shadaloo's island disappearing in the eruption of a volcano. Later, in Super Street Fighter, Akuma manipulates Sakura into embracing the Satsui no Hado, stating that Ryu's teachings only held her back and this is what led to the Illuminati kidnapping him. When she sets out to rescue Ryu, he absorbs the Satsui no Hado from her and asks her and Dan to kill him to prevent the Satsui no Hado from taking over him, but Akuma intervenes, triggering the awakening of Evil Ryu. Seeing him unrestrained, Akuma also unleashes his full power, turning into Oni, and they fight until Gill arrives and effortlessly keeps both fighters at bay, managing to depower them forcibly. In Street Fighter Unlimited, at the conclusion of the new World Warrior Tournament, once Ryu manages to find the balance between the good and evil within himself thanks to Oro's tutelage and finish Gill for good, he goes after Akuma to finish their duel. While the bout starts off intense and even, Ryu manages to eventually overpower Oni and deal him a humiliating defeat.Street Fighter Origins: Akuma  Created by UDON, this comic is another interpretation of his backstory. In this iteration, Akuma does not use the Raging Demon on Goutetsu as he did in the games' canon, but instead uses the Demon Armageddon\u00a0from Super Streeet Fighter IV. His motivation for killing Goutetsu is different from what his actual story establishes, with the reason being that Akuma learned from a thug who survived his onslaught on a remote cottage that Goutetsu was the one who revealed his father's location to some thugs that destroyed his home years prior, causing Akuma to attack with extreme fury.Street Fighter EX series Background  Akuma, rather surprisingly, appears only in the first Street Fighter EX tournament. It is unknown exactly what transpired during the tournament, but two events are rumored. Already aware of Ryu's capacity to tap into the Satsui no Hado (or \"Surge of Killing Intent\"), he may have been drawn to the tournament to witness Ryu's progress in either accepting the murderous intent, or rejecting it. However, once he arrived, another fighter may have intrigued Akuma more than Ryu. Kairi was another martial artist who showed the same level of capacity for Satsui no Hado as Ryu, but with the potential to twist it for the purposes of life instead of death. Before finding Kairi, Akuma stalked Ryu until he was alone. He approached Ryu and examined him who demanded to know what he wanted. Akuma, a little disgusted with what he sensed, simply stated that he was the man who killed Ryu's master, and Ryu was not ready to fight him. Ryu's eyes opened wide, but Akuma did not remain, just as he left, M. Bison approached Ryu and prevented him from following Akuma. Akuma finally tracked down Kairi. A man with a sword was rushing towards him. Not wanting to be interupted, he warped to the location in front of the swordsman and instantly knocked him out with one blow. When Akuma initiated a battle with Kairi, Kairi was beaten within an inch of his life, and lost the use of one eye when Akuma grazed his face with a Shoryuken. Just as Akuma was about to finish Kairi off, Kairi retaliated with a burst of power that was beyond his control, which actually succeeding in stunning Akuma, before Kairi disappeared from the fight. It is these events that may have had a hand in attracting the demon Garuda to the Street Fighter EX tournament. Garuda tracked down Akuma, believing that he was the source of power that Garuda had noticed, and attacked him. As the living embodiment of Satsui no Hado, the more that Akuma tapped into his murderous intent, the stronger Garuda became until Garuda succeeding in defeating Akuma, nearly killing him. Garuda then realized that Akuma was not the source of the power, and immediately left in search of the true source, leaving Akuma to suffer his fate alone. Knowing that he could never win against such a demon, Akuma remained hidden until Garuda could be wiped off the face of the earth by another...Endings Street Fighter EX  \"At that precise moment, I walked away! For my name is Akuma! Master of the Fist!\"Street Fighter EX Plus \u03b1  \"My name is Akuma! Master of the Fist!\" When the Satsui no Hadou strucks the earth, a mountain of corpses is left behind. Goutetsu, Gouken, Bison and now... Can a man become a fierce god by abandoning his humanity...?Cameos  Akuma appears in the Marvel-licensed Capcom fighting game, X-Men: Children of the Atom as a secret character, as well as Marvel Super Heroes as a cameo in one of Anita's (of Darkstalkers series) special moves. An original variation called Cyber-Akuma (Mech Gouki in Japan) appears in Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter as the game's final boss. Like the Shin Akuma version of the character, Cyber-Akuma is more powerful than the regular Akuma, possesses the greatest attack and defense of any character in the game, and is extremely fast. He can used after beating the game without using continues on the home consoles. Highlight Akuma on the Character Select screen, press the Select button six times, and press the high punch button, Cyber-Akuma will now be playable. He can't use a partner, but is so powerful that he can easily win without one. All of Cyber-Akuma's super moves are Level 1, including the Shining Gou Shock.Street Fighter vs. Darkstalkers  Akuma and his evolved form Oni appears in UDON's comic book crossover Street Fighter vs. Darkstalkers. Continuing from his previous encounter with Gill, Akuma loses his power as a result and loses his form as Oni. He desperately seeks a way to restore his demon form. Just then, Donovan appears and seeks to end his existence due to wielding powers comparable to a Darkstalker, but when he sends Dhylec to finish him, Akuma intercepts the great sword and restores his power, becoming Oni again. Before Oni could finish Donovan off, Anita intervenes and threatened Oni. Impressed by the duo's power, Oni tells Donovan to heal himself and seek him out again when he is ready. After Morrigan and Lilith convinces Donovan to help them fight Jedah, Donovan suggests seeing Akuma to gather the necessary power to open a portal to the Makai Realm. Akuma is ready to engage Donovan in a fight to the death, but only Morrigan's intervention convinces Akuma to cooperate with them. Akuma's plays an important role in fighting Jedah and the Fetus of God. After the abomination and the Darkstalker is defeated, Akuma stays behind in Makai to further his skills, stating he will find his way back to the human realm on his own.Gameplay and fighting style  Having mastered the original form of the unnamed \"Shotokan\" art, Akuma's fighting style is based in the same vein as the all-around characters, with a much more offense-oriented design. Akuma's overall style focuses on completely dominating the opponent and preventing counterattacks. His mix of raw attack power, combined with moves that can control the air and keep him mobile, allow him to maintain a fierce onslaught offensive that can end matches quickly. However, Akuma's power is offset by very low stamina and stun, meaning that any whiffed attack or defensive opening could irreversibly tip the scales against him and lead to a massive punishing; as a result, heavy investment on the player's part is required to properly utilize his full potential. Akuma's hard-to-match combo ability via his various command attacks or special attacks (e.g. Zanku Hadoken or Hyakkishu) can easily create pressure, especially against a downed opponent, and take advantage of wake-up based and/or cross-up based setups that often lead to some of the more high-damage combos in the series. In titles prior to Street Fighter III and prior to his 3D appearances, Akuma like Ryu and Ken, is also somewhat hindered by subpar physical range, making his footsies game rather difficult to manage in the neutral game, and often forces him to zone more with his projectiles (though he unlike the two of them can take more risks getting in due to more tools and damage on hand to do so). However, his poor range comes back to hurt him like so in Marvel vs. Capcom 3, where out of his chosen normal attacks to be used in the game, most of them are somewhat short in nature compared to Ryu's.Techniques  Akuma's Gohadoken can be used in midair as well, while his Tatsumaki Zankukyaku can floor the opponent and can also juggle, and his Goshoryuken can floor his opponent with one hit; it can lands up to 3 hits up close, and can also juggle with a single use in certain instances. Due to embracing the Satsui no Hado, Akuma has other special moves that Ryu and Ken normally lack. The Ashura Senku is a fast teleport move that allows him to escape or position himself almost at will. The Tenmakujinkyaku is a fast downwards-angled kick that he can use at the peak of his jumps. The Hyakkishu is a flip attack, similar to Cammy's Hooligan Combination, that allows Akuma to either attack or grab an opponent while moving forward. He also has the Zenpou Tenshin in the Alpha games, which makes him hop and roll forward a short distance. In Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix, Akuma retains all of his moves as both his Gohadoken and Tatsumaki Zankukyaku are embedded with poison and his Shakunetsu Hadoken can petrify his opponents when they get hit. He has a special attack that can headbutt his opponent similar to E. Honda's Sumo Headbutt. His Shun Goku Satsu, Tenma Gozanku, Messatsu Go Hadou and his Messatsu-Goshoryu serve as his Mighty Combos and has the most Mighty Combos with the total of four. He has four disguises serve as his special attacks. (Eg. a swimmer, a Japanese construction worker wields both a hammer and a long lumber, a fortune teller and a warlock gladiator) During the Tenma Gozanku, Akuma sometimes disguises as a swimmer to dive into the ground similar to Nagare's Plunge after executing the move. In Street Fighter V, Akuma maintains his moves and gains additional moves to his arsenal. His battle style changes to become more brutal fighting when he pulls off his combo to his opponent or seriously damaging his opponent with his moves. Akuma has a V-Skill callled Rakan where he strikes a defensive stance similar to Ryu\u2019s Mind\u2019s Eye that can parry an incoming attack. He can follow-up the move with an upward kick or a long reaching palm strike. His V-Trigger is the Dohatsu Shoten where he can unleashes his Gohadoken in two hits even mid-air. He can also make a deadly combo to his opponent with an ability similar to Messatsu Goshoryu and his Misogi. While using this ability, Akuma is able to unleash his Raging Demon during his Critical Art. In his appearance in Tekken (Mobile), Akuma's primary basic combo launcher is his Tenmakujinkyaku as his Gohadoken, Goshoryuken, Shakunetsu Hadoken, Zanku Hadoken, Tatsumaki Zankukyaku, Messatsu Gohado and Messatsu Goshoryu appear as his Special Waza Cards which shows an exclamation point in front of its cards as other of his basic techniques serving as his Strike, Stun and Combo Starter Waza Cards. In both 3-Star and 4-Star appearances, he will gain his Wrath of the Raging Demon Ultra Combo in Street Fighter IV series as his Rage Art. Both his Messatsu Gohado and Messatsu Goshoryu were labeled as both Gohadoken and Goshoryuken respectively in his 4-Star moves as Akuma immediately defeats his/her opponent in a single move, dealing massive damage.Super Combos  Akuma's Super Combos, introduced in the Alpha series (for reasons explained below) consist of a high-powered Gohadoken, a powered-up Zanku Hadoken, a Shoryuken-based move similar to Ken's Shoryureppa without the scorching effect, and an upward-spiraling Tatsumaki that can also be used in midair. Akuma's most well known Super Combo is the Shun Goku Satsu, also known as the Raging Demon; it is traditionally one of the strongest attacks in any game Akuma appears in. Two more moves are introduced in Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike and the Capcom vs. SNK series: the Kongou Kokuretsuzan has Akuma strike the ground hard, generating lightning and waves of energy, and the Misogi has him perform a homing teleport directly above the opponent and deliver a fierce descending strike. In 3rd Strike, Akuma is the only other character to possess more than 3 Super Arts AND have 3 of them usable during a match. Ibuki has four Super Arts in total, due only to having two of them swapped between Second Impact and Third Strike; Gill can also use his three Arts in a single match, though the other two are rendered unusable after Resurrection.\u00a0Akuma is also one of two characters without any EX Specials in the series, with the other being Gill. In Street Fighter IV, he has the Wrath of the Raging Demon as his Ultra Combo. In Super Street Fighter IV, Akuma's second Ultra Combo is an extremely powerful Tatsumaki-based move known as Demon Armageddon. Its Japanese name, Tenshou Kaireki Jin, reveals it to be the attack that Akuma would perfect into the literal sea-splitting and explosively ascending technique shown in 3rd Strike. In his appearance in Street Fighter X Tekken, unlike other characters, he has two Super Arts; his signature 'hidden' Raging Demon and the Misogi, which returns from the Capcom vs. SNK games. His Cross Art also uses the Tenma Shurettou, also making its return from the Capcom vs. SNK games. In Street Fighter V, Akuma gains a new move called Sekia Kuretsuha as his Critical Art where he creates a glowing red orb on his hand, and then slams on the ground, creating a huge blast of fire in front of him. If Dohatsu Shoten is active, performing the well known sequence of buttons activates the Raging Demon, a barrage of punch which ends with the opponent downed, and with Akuma with the kanji \u795e\u4eba glowing on the back of his gi and in the screen.As a Boss  As a computer-controlled boss in most games (e.g. Super Street Fighter II Turbo), Akuma is even more powerful, faster, and more durable in comparison, usually only appearing as a final or hidden boss. This reflects his personality, as Akuma often holds back his power so as to give his opponents a fighting chance; when fought as a secret boss, Akuma effectively deems the player's character worthy, and 'powers up' accordingly. In Super Street Fighter IV, Akuma is presented once again as a new boss. He is faster, uses Akuma's 7th color scheme (purple gi, red hair and darker skin tone) and can input two Zanku Hadokens without using any of the Super Combo Gauge, which is similar to Shin Akuma in Street Fighter III: 2nd Impact. Compared to the playable version, the true form of Akuma has higher stamina and stun. His Ashura Senku barely has any startup and recovery, allowing him to dictate the pace of the match. By closely inspecting his frame data, the greater priority, faster startup and recovery of his specials becomes obvious. His Super and Ultra Raging Demons both travel farther and much faster (although they can still be jumped over) and are under most circumstances invulnerable to attacks, including other Ultra Combos that would normally cancel out the Raging Demon. Compared to the playable version, his second Ultra Combo, the Demon Armageddon, requires about half the frames to activate, making it much easier to connect with. In contrast to the other secret bosses (Gouken, Oni and Evil Ryu), who have an extremely aggressive but predictable AI, Shin Akuma relies on the player to make mistakes, reacting just a split second after the player's move(s). Although this version of Akuma was confirmed to be the new boss version fought in Arcade Mode, he is indeed Akuma using the full extent of his abilities.Balance Issues  In Super Street Fighter II Turbo, Akuma is banned in U.S. tournaments, and soft-banned (i.e. not used on 'principle' as opposed to being officially unusable) in Japanese tournaments. This is a result of the fact that Akuma was initially designed to be extremely powerful; such power is potentially reflected in his lack of a Super Combo at that point. As explained previously,\u00a0Turbo\u00a0HD Remix\u00a0attempted to make this version of Akuma more playable by lowering his stamina, giving the Zanku Hadoken a 'blowback' effect, and adding a much weaker Shun Goku Satsu as his Super Combo. Despite these efforts, Akuma has remained banned in HD Remix for the large majority of tournaments, as the changes made to his character did not offset his overreaching power compared to the rest of the cast, and in some cases made it worse. Due to the steep angle of the Zanku Hadoken (inherited from his later appearances), it is possible to perform cross-up combos that could not be done originally, and with the 'blowback' effect, he can gain extra air time to avoid a projectile the opponent throws at him. In addition, due to a bug and the move's speed, the Raging Demon cannot be interrupted at close range, making it near impossible to avoid when cornered.Trivia See also Movelists Wikia Links References Ryu  Ryu (\u30ea\u30e5\u30a6(\u9686), Ry\u016b, \"Prosperous\", \"Plentiful\", \"Abundant\") is the main protagonist of the Street Fighter series, first appearing in the original Street Fighter. He is an experienced martial artist, highly focused on his training, aiming to become the strongest he can.Biography Concept  In the early days of most Street Fighter media, Ryu often had a more \"rough and tumble\" personality, as well as a bit of a goofy and lighthearted side to him. He was also shown to be quite irritable when hungry. In his short story in the manga Street Fighter Gaiden, he was shown to be a rather happy individual, a trait common among shounen main characters, such as Son Goku from the Dragon Ball series and Luffy from the One Piece series. Some of these traits are preserved in modern portrayals.Appearance  Ryu's most recognizable attire consists of a white karate gi with the sleeves torn off, medium length hair, a long red headband, a black martial arts belt and bare feet (a choice he makes of his own, believing it to be more comfortable). In many of his appearances, Ryu carries around a large, white duffel bag containing items important to his travels, such as clothing, plane tickets, passports, and local currency. In the first Street Fighter, Ryu wore a white headband and red shoes. Over the course of time, he has grown taller and more muscular; his karate gi has grown more tattered, his gloves have changed from brown to red and his headband has changed from white to red. Most notably, his hair color has darkened over time; his original Street Fighter appearance gave him red hair, brown in Street Fighter Alpha, dark brown in Street Fighter II, and black in Street Fighter III, Street Fighter IV and Street Fighter V. In the Street Fighter III series, Ryu\u2019s black hair has a blue tint. The red headband Ryu wears was originally worn by Ken. Ryu gave his white headband to Sakura before getting his red headband. From Street Fighter IV onwards, the red gloves worn by Ryu have started to bear stylized writing, which resembles the F\u016brinkazan characters on his belt. In some official Street Fighter II artwork, Ryu's belt has four kanji emblazoned upon the right end: wind (\u98a8, Kaze), forest (\u6797, Hayashi), fire (\u706b, Hi) and mountain (\u5c71, Yama); these four kanji make up the F\u016brinkazan. The same four kanji can be seen on a sign on the left-hand side of Ryu's stage in Street Fighter II, and are also visible on his belt in Street Fighter IV. The four words are based on chapter seven of Sun Tzu's Art of War, which dictates how one should conduct battle: \"as fast as the wind, as quiet as the forest, as daring as fire, and immovable as the mountain.\" In Street Fighter II V, Ryu wears some casual outfits throughout the episodes; his primary appearance is a white short sleeve shirt, blue denim jeans and red and white sneakers. He also has a black watch on his left wrist. Ryu is not wearing his red headband. When he wears his white karate gi, he only wears brown prayer bead bracelet on his left wrist. He is also more tanned than in the games. His second alternate costume in Street Fighter V consist of\u00a0only his white karate pants with a black belt to his waist and\u00a0tatters in the edge of his pants, gray shoulder bands in each sides and hand wraps on his hands. He also has a black facial beard.Personality  Ryu is a silent, meek, humble, submissive, self-deprecating, and respectful individual; which is often juxtaposed against the light-hearted, fiery persona of his childhood friend, Ken. He wanders the world with the desire for complete mastery of his martial art, and takes both his travels and training seriously. For Ryu, the training and the mastery that comes from the fight are all that he requires for satisfaction, declining the more material trappings of his various accomplishments as a warrior, simply moving on to his next challenge once he is victorious without delay, unless he is offered food or if he wants to converse with his friendly rivals. Though he does not actively seek the role of a hero, he possesses a strong sense of justice as well; protecting the innocent against the predations of bullies and tyrants is the one of the few things that Ryu will prioritize over a satisfying fight. Because of this \"wandering warrior\" persona and also being\u00a0trained far away from modern-day culture, Ryu often appears detached to others. Despite this, he is a kind, authentic, good-hearted, and demonstrative\u00a0warrior who readily helps those less fortunate than himself, is protective and gentle towards children, and on rare occasions, shows a sense of humor (albeit a bad one). He also respects others with skills equal to his own; in the Marvel vs. Capcom series, he seems to\u00a0hold superheroes\u00a0like\u00a0Captain America, Spider-Man, Cyclops, and Wolverine\u00a0in high respect. To those who he is able to beat and is on friendly terms with, he compliments or encourages them to continue training and get stronger, sometimes offering help first hand (e.g. Dan). In his appearances in the manga adaptation of Street Fighter II, the anime series Street Fighter II V and the UDON Entertainment comics, Ryu would intake large amounts of food if the opportunity presented itself. There is, however, a dark side to Ryu: His drive to improve himself, no matter the difficulty, risks developing into a drive to win and to be the best at any cost. This darker drive is fed by (and in turn feeds) the Satsui no Hado within his soul, an influence which Ryu must constantly fight to suppress from killing (at least until the time of Street Fighter III). In times when his inner darkness threatens to overcome his humanity, Ryu relies on his friends and rivals - primarily Ken, Gouken, Chun-Li, Sagat, and Sakura - to keep him grounded and\u00a0help him\u00a0overcome\u00a0out of it. By the time of Street Fighter III, Ryu is somewhat more friendly; while still very quiet and reserved, but is willing to greet people with a smile and some kind advice, very much like his master Gouken.Character Relationships  Over his many travels, Ryu has made many allies and friends, but he also has a few enemies, including his dark half.Allies Ken  Ken is Ryu's best friend from his childhood, as the two have trained in the same art of Ansatsuken for a long time. They share a very close bond to each other and will help out each other no matter the cost. Both of them have also trained together under Gouken. One can see that they care for each other and never quarrel. Although Ryu spends his time training, Ken will go as far as inviting him to his wedding and Ryu will answer the call (seen in Ken's ending in Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix). The two usually greet each other by exchanging fist bumps, usually before starting a friendly sparring match.Guile  Guile greatly respects Ryu and vice-versa. It is noted that they are friends since Ryu and Guile have eaten Natoo and they get along very well.Chun-Li  Chun-Li deeply admires Ryu for his strong determination and will to never give up in his fights and goals. Ryu seems to respect Chun-Li as well for her great fighting abilities.Cammy  Cammy has a strong admiration for Ryu due to his great strength, fighting skills and heroic traits. They share a common enemy, M. Bison, against who they have worked together several times.Dan  Despite Dan's faults and behavior, Ryu does consider him a friend.Oro  While Ryu is weirded out by his eccentric personality, he still respects him as a master martial artist.Sakura  Sakura is Ryu's fan and a close friend of his. She has always tried to get Ryu to train her in hopes of becoming a better fighter. While Ryu does not believe that he is ready to take her as a student, they will sometimes have a match to see her improvement in fighting.Fei Long  Fei Long and Ryu share a mutual respect.Sean  Being Ken's student, Sean is a friend of Ryu. Ryu and Sean usually engage in sparring to improve Sean's beginner skills.Gouken  Gouken is Ryu's master who raised him since he was a boy. Ryu also views him as a father and was inspired by him to become a martial artist.Hugo  Ryu is impressed by Hugo's ability to withstand his Shin Souryuken and became his tag team partner for a while.Rose  Rose is a close friend of Ryu. Like himself, she detests the Satsui no Hado too, and will often help him to overcome its influence.Nash  Ryu and Charlie both respect each others skill after they fought in China.Sagat  Sagat is one of Ryu's most respected rivals, as he was the one to bring out the Satsui no Hado out of him during the first World Warrior Tournament. At first, Sagat had a grudge against Ryu for stripping away his pride as a warrior. Later on, though, Sagat began to respect Ryu for his brave will and sportsmanship, and the two have become great rivals afterwards.Gen  Having encountered him during his time as a restaurant operator, he became fascinated with Ryu. Gen would eventually test Ryu's strength in combat and held him in high regard.Elena  Ryu and Elena respects each other's fighting style and have respect for each other.Dhalsim  In Street Fighter V, Dhalsim mentors Ryu in his attempts to control the Satsui No Hado and defended him from Necalli.Birdie  Ryu first encountered Birdie during the first World Warrior tournament and has fought against him sporadically over time. He becomes an uneasy ally during a raid on Shadaloo's base in Street Fighter V, despite Birdie formerly working for Shadaloo.Alex  Alex considers Ryu as his ultimate rival, after being momentarily caught off guard by his attacks. They engage in a fight with a currently unknown outcome.Jin Kazama  Ryu has a positive relationship with Jin from Namco's Tekken series, as both fighters have an evil power they seek to overcome.Wolverine  Ryu's crossover rival from the X-Men franchise. Both Ryu and Wolverine respect and acknowledge each other's fighting skills and techniques in battle.Neutral Juri  While they have little interaction, Juri is especially attracted to Ryu's strength and power, and very much enjoys fighting the Ansatsuken style and even berates Ryu for trying to find a purpose in fighting, saying he should live for the pleasure of it. Upon fighting Evil Ryu, Juri gets \"overly excited\" saying if Ryu keeps glaring at her like that, she'll start getting \"frisky\". Despite her attraction, Juri dislikes Satsui no Hado, saying it's too abhorrent even for her. Despite their shared interests in fighting, Ryu and Juri don't really mesh.Kazuya Mishima  Because of the Tekken character's truly evil nature and complete embracement of the Devil Gene power, Kazuya is a great rival of Ryu. Despite their opposing personalities and their clashes in Street Fighter x Tekken and Namco x Capcom, Ryu and Kazuya occasionally team up in Project x Zone 2, so it can be assume that there is a neutral relationship between the two protagonists of the two series.Enemies M. Bison  One of Ryu's mortal enemies, Bison has repeatedly tried to capture Ryu in hopes of using him as a host body or brainwash him into being a member of Shadaloo. Due to Ryu having the Satsui no Hado sealed in him, this is part of M. Bison's plan to control that dark power for himself. Ultimately, it is Ryu who is the one to finally defeat Bison once and for all.Seth  One of Ryu's greatest enemies, Ryu despises Seth and vice versa due to their different philosophies on power and on how to acquire it.Gill  Gill is one of Ryu's enemies. Ryu finds Gill to be no better than Bison due to his actions and the lengths he has gone to achieve them.Akuma  Akuma is one of Ryu's most hated enemies, as he was the one who tried to kill his master, Gouken. Akuma also attempts to lure Ryu into succumbing to the Satsui no Hado, therefore casting aside his humanity, in hopes of finally finding a worthy opponent for the ultimate fight to the death that he seeks. Ryu knows this is a trap of temptation planned by Akuma, as Ryu has tried his best to find a way to get rid of the Satsui no Hado while refusing to succumb to that kind of power.Evil Ryu  Ryu is aware of how dangerous his other half is and tries his best to keep him under control.Adon  Adon seeks to defeat Ryu in order to prove that he has surpassed his former master Sagat.Necalli  Necalli is an ancient spirit that wants to devour Ryu's soul as part of a prophecy. Necalli constantly attacks Ryu during A Shadow Falls until he is finally beaten by Ryu.Story Early Life Pre-Street Fighter  As a very young child, Ryu was orphaned and left with no memories about his parents, and whether they were still alive. He was found and adopted by a man named Gouken who raised Ryu in his secluded dojo and trained Ryu in the ways of his martial arts. Shortly afterwards, Gouken would later train his best friend's spoiled son, Ken Masters. Ken served not only as a sparring partner, but also gave Ryu a friend in the form of a boy his own age. Ryu looked up to Gouken as a father figure, and regards Ken as his best friend and surrogate brother, a relationship which remains to this day. When Ryu turned 23 years old, Gouken believed that Ryu was ready to travel the world in order to test and hone his martial skills against the best fighters from around the world. With this, Ryu left Gouken's dojo, and headed to fight in the World Warrior tournament.The first World Warrior tournament Main Article: Street Fighter  Ryu is one of the participants of the World Warrior tournament. After defeating all challengers, Ryu's skills earn him the right to fight its host, Sagat. Sagat nearly beats Ryu into unconsciousness and, thinking he had won, drops his guard to help Ryu up. Ryu, however, allows himself to be engulfed by the Satsui no Hado and strikes Sagat with a nearly-fatal Metsu Shoryuken that not only knocks Sagat unconscious, but also marks his chest with a great scar. After regaining consciousness and discovering what had happened, Sagat swears vengeance on Ryu. While it wasn't revealed at the time, when Ryu scarred Sagat, some of his Hado passed to Sagat.Beginning the battles against Akuma and Bison Main Article: Street Fighter Alpha series  Ryu leaves Sagat behind and returns to his home, only to find that Gouken, his master and adoptive father, has apparently been murdered. Learning that Akuma had fought and supposedly killed his master, Ryu began to travel the world to find this man. He encounters and fights Akuma on a secluded island known as Gokuentou, and wins; however, Akuma was only testing him, and senses that Ryu has the same powers as he does. He proceeds to tell Ryu about the Satsui no Hado - a power that consumes the practitioners of their shared fighting style, driving them to win even when it means killing the opponent. Akuma then uses his fist to smash the island, leaving Ryu stranded. Sometime after escaping the island, Ryu battles Ken and loses. Ken realizes Ryu is not himself, as he has been deeply troubled since his last victory over Sagat. Ken gives him his red hairband as a reminder to stay focused, which Ryu was sincerely grateful for. Soon thereafter, a fan of his, named Sakura, comes up and expresses her desire to train under him. Ryu replies that he himself still has much to learn, but allows Sakura to take a picture of him for now. At some point, Ryu is found by Sagat, who is out for a grudge match. Ryu protests that Sagat hasn't fully recovered from their last bout, but Sagat persists. Ryu lets Sagat win rather than do any further damage, and Sagat leaves. Only later, upon reflection, does Sagat realize that Ryu held back, vowing to fight him again. Two years later, Ryu continues to be troubled by what Akuma had told him, compounded by his encounter with Rose, who has intricate ties to M. Bison. She tells him that he cannot defeat Bison unless he fights him at the cost of his soul. True to form, when Ryu confronts Bison, he is defeated despite putting up a valiant fight. Bison takes the semi-conscious Ryu and begins brainwashing him, using the revelation that the Satsui no Hado - the dark power Ryu struggles to avoid using - is akin to Bison's own Psycho Power. This scene is interrupted by the entrance of Sagat, Ken, and Sakura, each of them having followed Ryu for their own reasons. While Ken and Sakura distract Bison, Sagat fights the brainwashed Ryu, quickly noticing the effects Bison's brainwashing has had on him. At Sagat's urging, Ryu comes to his senses to confront and defeat Bison, destroying him temporarily.Second world warrior tournament and Bison's return Main Article: Street Fighter II series  During the World Warrior tournament, Ryu enters to test his skills, and defeats many of the new warriors. He encourages Ken to re-enter as well. During the tournament, he helps Guile, Ken, Chun-Li and Cammy defeat Bison. However, Bison refused Guile's offer to surrender himself to the military before unleashing all of his Psycho Power to commit suicide and it is unknown how far Ryu himself progressed in the tournament, although it is implied he may have lost to Ken. Other sources on the other hand support the idea that he's the tournament winner. In his non-canon ending, he shortly leaves the tournament after he wins against Bison, and revisits his master's grave to tell about his victory and the experiences he had with the other fighters. Ryu then states that the ultimate battle is out there waiting for him and departs, stating that the fight is everything. In HD Remix, Ryu appears in Ken's ending, appearing in a somewhat blurry photo with Guile wearing a tuxedo but still wearing his red headband. This is the first time Ryu is seen wearing anything other than his gi.S.I.N tournament and battle against Seth Main Article:Street Fighter IV series  After the second World Warrior tournament, Ryu continued his journey and wound up in an isolated desert where he trained. Ryu then remembers his argument with Akuma, with Akuma urging Ryu to give in to the Dark Hado or else he will kill him. Ryu then leaves a desert and goes to a bar where he meets a biker. The biker then tells him a story about an American Martial Arts Champion who abandoned his family. Believing it to be Ken, Ryu visits the house of the said champion but is ambushed by C. Viper. During the fight, Ryu tries to fight off the secret agent but was no match for her. Suddenly, the Delta Red agent Cammy then attempts to ambush C. Viper. However, Cammy was also no match for Viper and Viper then tortures Cammy, in which the Dark Hado then takes over Ryu and engages C. Viper but would easily defeat her. Luckily for Viper, she manages to escape the possessed Ryu. Angered, Ryu then slaughters multiple S.I.N scientists who witnessed the fight until Ken, Chun-Li, Guile, and Sakura arrive to save Ryu and help Cammy. Sakura would then restrain the possessed Ryu as Ken calls the hospital to help Cammy. Ryu would then regain his consciousness and realize what he has done. After being sent to Ken's mansion, Ryu realizes he is being targeted by S.I.N and its leader Seth for their evil plans. With Guile's plan to infiltrate Seth's cruise ship to incarcerate him, Ryu then tags along, knowing that Seth would be waiting for him. After traveling to the base, Ryu and Ken then dispatch multiple S.I.N thugs before Ryu encounters Seth himself. Ryu and Seth then engage, with Seth easily overpowering Ryu and giving him his twisted philosophy of power. Ryu then admits that he never understood what power is and that he understands Seth's philosophy fore stating that the power he describes is not what he's after. Seth, unamused, continues beating up Ryu before Ryu awakens a new power and nearly kills Seth with it. Ryu then collapses from this power, and senses it in Ken. A few days later, Ryu and Ken then part ways, with Ryu stating that they will meet again. Ryu then enters into a new tournament to further master his skills as well as reunite with his longtime friend Ken for another rematch. During his journey, he meets up with Sakura whom he encourages to train harder. Meanwhile Ryu also meets up with Sagat once more; the two fight, and while the result of the fight is unknown, it is implied that Ryu won. During the final round with the tournament host Seth (actually a copy of him), he defeats him in the S.I.N. headquarters. During and after this battle the building fell around them as Ryu unleashed the Satsui no Hado on the BLECE machine, a weapon of mass destruction developed by S.I.N. that harnessed the energy in the human body. During this, Sakura - who has been searching for Ryu - finds him and the BLECE machine, and a pulse of energy from it knocks her into a wall. Ryu defends her by unleashing a Shoryuken on the machine, and they leave the building together, the weapon destroyed. He then encounters Gouken, who has in fact survived his last battle with Akuma, and Gouken uses the \"Power of Nothingness\" to seal the Satsui no Hado which is eating at Ryu, knocking him unconscious. Akuma then arrives on the scene to challenge his brother for a death duel, the winner of which will claim \"the cub\" (meaning Ryu). The outcome of the duel is unknown but, since Ryu is later seen free of Dark Hado's influence, it is very likely that either Gouken won or the battle ended in a draw (possibly interrupted). Later, Ryu and Ken chase their long-lost master along a cliff face, with Ken wanting Gouken to stick around while Ryu wishes him well. Afterwards, he and Ken are walking through the desert while Rufus mocks them on his motorcycle, though it later breaks down and he is left pushing it while Ryu and Ken drives by (in Ken's jeep). Ryu later bids Sakura farewell as she, Dan and Blanka leave for home on a cruise ship. Some time later, having decided that his battles have made him stronger, he meets a now-older Sakura. What happens next is unknown, although Gouken might have taught Ryu the Shin Shoryuken and Denjin Hadoken at some point before Street Fighter III.Final Battle with Shadoloo Story  Prologue - 'Finding True Strength' In his dream, he is fighting against his evil self, claiming to him that the power to kill will make him stronger, which Ryu ultimately rejects it. Gouken is in a sparring match during the incident. Ryu charges himself in the Satsui no Hado and attempts to hit his master with a single Hadoken. It explodes in a flash of light. Ryu wakes up from his dream with Gouken telling him that the Satsui no Hado almost consumed him. Rashid and Azam find Ryu, introducing himself as a hero who travels the world. Gouken questions Rashid why he comes to see Ryu. Rashid states he wants to challenge Ryu in a match which is to test his mettle. Ryu doesn't immediately get up to fight, worrying about the Satsui no Hado, which confuses Rashid and has Gouken questioning him why he didn't do it, citing Ryu's quote \"The answer lies in the heart of battle\". Ryu eventually gets up and spars with Rashid, resulting in a victory. Rashid learns from the fight about himself. He thanks Ryu for the lesson and leaves. Ryu decides that he should leave, too, and better understand his power. Gouken tells Ryu to meet Ken, who has been concerned about him. Ryu and Ken finally meet in Brazil. Ken was told by Gouken about Ryu's struggles with the Satsui no Hado and thinks a good match can solve it, so they fight. Afterwards, Ryu still worries about the Satsui no Hado. Ken reassures Ryu that if Ryu falls over to the dark side, he'll take him down and stop it. Ken tells Ryu to just relax and fight. Ryu goes to China and gets ambushed by a Shadaloo soldier. Nash comes in and takes down the soldier. Nash expected to see Ryu, which triggers a bit of Satsui no Hado within him. Nash says they have to fight so he can understand the power and know its limits. The fight ultimately ends in a draw. Nash is surprised by the power, having it surpass his expectations. Ryu tells him that he tries to suppress the power and struggles with it, but has decided to not let it take him over, which Nash respects. Ryu thanks him for the fight and Nash leaves. Other Prologue Appearances:A Shadow Falls  Ryu meets with Dhalsim, training Mahesh, and says he is still struggling with the Satsui no Hado and needs help. They decide to have a spar. After the spar, Dhalsim tells him that suppressing the power will eventually lead to the power consuming him. He tells him that he needs to face the Hado and conquer it. Necalli drops down from above, looking to consume fighters' souls. Dhalsim defends Mahesh while Ryu fights Necalli. Necalli overpowers Ryu, which almost triggers his dark power. Dhalsim takes Ryu's punch, proclaiming that he can't let the Hado take him over. Dhalsim fights off Necalli. Ryu notices a Black Moon veering over and blocking the sun, which gives him visions of M. Bison. Necalli eventually melts away temporarily. He is told about Necalli by Dhalsim, telling him that Necalli is an ancient being that consumes warriors' souls and only appears when many warriors are needed in a crisis. Ryu concludes that the world is in crisis because of the Black Moons. Ryu finally joins up with Ken, Chun-Li and Karin as they team up to make a final assault against Shadaloo. As Chun-Li defeats F.A.N.G. while rescuing Li-Fen, Ryu finally faces off Bison, who is ready to challenge him, and Ryu states that his strength was to push foward and he is ready to fight him. After an epic long battle, Bison isn't giving up yet, until Ryu hits him with a Hadoken, infused with the Power of Nothingness, seemingly hinting at Ryu's mastery of the power and a sublimation of the Satsui No Hado. Bison's body begins to crack as it dissipates in a flash of light, defeating the madman. As the base is about to destroyed, Ryu, Guile, Chun-Li and Li-Fen escape; Chun-Li is slow to catch up, so Ryu uses his Denjin Hadoken to stop the fires from the explosion. After the incident, Ryu is meditating as Ken visits him for the second time. He challenges him for a friendly sparring match as he tells Ryu to prove if he already found his answer. Ryu is able to defeat Ken as Ken also manages to knock Ryu's red headband. As it falls on the ground, Ryu realizes that he already found his answer of his true strength. As he gets his headband, Ken is happy to see his friend has grown, and Ryu also says that he still needs his headband for the battle. The two are later seen having a friendly fist bump with each other.Third World Warrior Tournament and battle against the Illuminati Main Article: Street Fighter III  Years later, Ryu enters the third World Warrior tournament to further advance his fighting abilities. His most notable fight during the tournament is against Hugo, who is able to withstand his Shin Shoryuken and hold his own. He continues his travels afterward, meeting Oro along the way. Ryu ends up being defeated by Oro who likes him to be his successor. He was later seen in Oro's ending, being trained by him but Ryu is unaware of Oro's presence as he only heard his voice. Shortly after the tournament, Ryu meets up with Ken for a friendly match in the latter's storyline, from which he emerges the victor. Ryu later fights against\u00a0Sean who has been asked by Ken to fight him. Ryu easily defeats him from time to time with just a single Hadoken as he noticed his actions. Ryu also serves as Hugo's pro-wrestling tag-team partner for a brief period of time before moving on, also shown in Hugo's storyline. At some point, he encounters Alex, whom he solidly defeats. Ryu encourages the young wrestler to continue honing his abilities against strong opponents. Fascinated by Ryu's skill and determined to become stronger, Alex soon sets out to find Ryu for a rematch. In his ending, Ryu is under a waterfall practicing his mind and body. He mumbles about the meaning of a true warrior, why he needs to be strong and reminisces his youthful days. A single leaf falls over him and he crushes the leaf with his left hand. Ryu believes that as long as his strong opponents and some fierce battles will excite him, he will possess the strength to move even one of his fingers and decides to keep on fighting.Crossover appearances SNK vs. Capcom series  Ryu has appeared as a playable character in every installment of the SNK vs. Capcom series. His personality is depicted as having a slightly sarcastic demeanor to some foes, but is praised by a few other characters.SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos  His ending has two variations, both his, and an extended version seen when the game is cleared with Red Arremer. In Ryu's ending, he states that his experiences tell that there are plenty more worthy opponents in the world, and Ryu sets out once again in his journey. In the extended version, after Ryu's statement, an extra scene is shown with Akuma observing Ryu from a long distance, stating that he will continue to monitor his progress.Marvel vs. Capcom series X-Men vs. Street Fighter  Ryu is a playable character in X-Men vs. Street Fighter and appears in Wolverine's ending.Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter  Ryu is a playable character in Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter. When Ryu was asked by Captain America and other superheroes if he wanted to join the Avengers, he told them that he must continue to follow his own path to mastery. The others respect his wish and bade him their luck on his adventures.Marvel vs. Capcom series  Ryu appeared as a playable character in the Marvel vs. Capcom series.Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds/Ultimate  In his ending, Ryu is shown to continue his journey in search for strong challengers. This leads him to a confrontation with Iron Fist, and Wolverine in a team up with the X-Men against Docter Doom, he appears in the expansion released later the same year, Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3. In Ultimate, Ryu's ending was changed to show that Iron Fist chose him to be his successor to the Iron Fist legacy. Ryu is shown using the mystic arts of K'un-Lun to fight off Akuma, stating it is the perfect counter and alternative to the Satsui no Hado.Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite  Ryu appears playable character in the Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite. In the Story mode, unlike the Street Fighter V, Marvel villain Thanos actually use a gauntlet like device from Abel City's technology in order to take Ryu's Satsui no Hado for himself.Namco's X series Namco \u00d7 Capcom  Ryu is a main character in Namco X Capcom as a central character.Project \u00d7 Zone  Ryu is a playable character in Project X Zone as he, Juri and Jin Kazama are a target for Seth who wanted to use his Satsui no Hado, Juri's Feng Shui Engine, and Jin's Devil Gene for his own purposes.Project \u00d7 Zone 2  Ryu is a playable character in Project X Zone 2, alongside Ken (as a Pair Unit). They join the party midway into the story while following a robotic version of Axel Stone from a martial arts tournament in New York to an area where the party find themselves cornered by M. Bison and Juri. Ryu's role in the story is somewhat important; Bison, having taken an interest in Ryu's Satsui no Hado (along with Kazuya's and Jin's Devil Gene), often crosses paths with the party in Ryu's pursuit. Although Bison doesn't find an opportunity to capture Ryu and the Satsui no Hado, he manages to brainwash Ken instead later on, forcing Ryu and Ken to fight. Ryu uses the power summoned by the Satsui no Hado to beat the Psycho Power out of Ken using a Metsu Hadoken, freeing Ken and allowing the two to return to the party; despite being non-canon, this is one of the very few instances where Ryu is shown to be able to control the Satsui no Hado at will.Street Fighter X Tekken  Ryu appears in Street Fighter X Tekken, with Ken as his tag partner. In their ending, Ryu begins to succumb to the Satsui no Hado as the Pandora's box is about to open. As the blinding light disappears, Ryu is nowhere to be found. Only his red headband was left on the ground, which Ken picks up as he wonders where he disappeared to. Ryu's text ending suggests that two things could have happened when he vanished: that he either succumbed to Pandora's power and disappeared with it, or he sacrificed himself to protect the world from the box. There is no certain answer given, but it suggests that Ryu will not be gone for too long. Their Tekken rivals are Kazuya Mishima and Nina Williams.Other Crossovers Tatsunoko vs. Capcom  Ryu appeared playable in Tatsunoko vs. Capcom, along with Chun-Li and Alex.Rival Schools: United By Fate  Ryu is briefly seen in Sakura's ending.Asura's Wrath  In Capcom's 3D beat 'em up game, Asura's Wrath, Ryu appears in a special post-launch DLC mode for the game as a boss opponent with the player using the eponymous character in the \"Lost Episodes\" series. The story starts with Ryu being suddenly warped to Asura's world through a dimensional rip and is suddenly challenged by the god wherein he is challenged to two 1-round matches in the vein of Super Street Fighter IV. In between matches however, Ryu will switch Ultras. The player character, Asura, uses a Burst gauge much like in his native gameplay. The battle draws to a close when Asura uppercuts Ryu straight off of the Earth and lands on the moon, inadvertedly bringing about Evil Ryu. The episode ends when Akuma also manages to appear, wanting to challenge Asura personally.Street Fighter \u00d7 Mega Man  Ryu is one of the bosses of Street Fighter \u00d7 Mega Man. His stage is designed after an old Japanese castle. The background where the player battle him is reminiscent of that of Ryu's original arena in Street Fighter II.Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U  Ryu appears as a downloadable content character in the Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U. He comes with an arena based on his classic Suzaku Castle stage from Street Fighter II. His appearance marks the first time a Super Smash Bros. game has two third-party characters from the same company, as fellow Capcom hero Mega Man is also playable. Ryu is also the first DLC third-party character in the Super Smash Bros. series as well as the only character to have two Final Smash attacks when in possession of a Smash Ball (explained below). Ryu's Special attacks consist of his usual signature moves (the Hadoken, Shoryuken, Tatsumaki Senpu Kyaku, and a Focus Attack) as well as some of his standard basic moves. Much like his home series, each of Ryu's attacks has three levels based off of his light, medium and heavy attacks: performing the attacks with a simple button tap (like most other characters in the game) is the weakest, but good for combos, while holding the button for a second makes the attack slightly stronger, and slamming the button and D-pad in the desired direction will do the most damage. Using the directional commands from the Street Fighter series (as opposed to the standard Smash Bros. input) will give Ryu an even more enhanced version of the attacks, and also allows him to do the Shakunetsu Hadoken. His normal moveset uses his normals, but features different attacks based on either tapping or holding down the attack button, has his Collarbone Breaker as his standard side attack and has his Joudan Sokutogeri as his forward Smash. He is essentially a truly combo-oriented character who can be played either like a traditional Smash Bros. character or a Street Fighter one. For his Final Smash attacks, he uses either the Shinku Hadoken if the enemy is in the air or far away, or the Shin Shoryuken if the opponent is on the ground in front of him.Blood Brothers 2  Ryu, M.

The Jodan Sanrengeki delivers a one-two punch before delivering a powerful kick. The Sokuto Rush allows Ryu deliver a dashing kick that can blow back his opponents. The Hadoken is now red and yellow and bears a hawk-like image and the Tatsumaki Senpukyaku has been modified into the basic Tatsumaki, trapping opponents in a whirlwind kick. His Shoryuken has been left untouched. The Hadoken and Tatsumaki also has super attack variants - the Taka Tatsumaki increases Ryu's reach with the Tatsumaki while the Taka Hadoken has Ryu fire a larger fireball with the form of a hawk, which can strike and lift up an opponent for extra damage.Comics Street Fighter II manga  Ryu has been training in with his best friend Ken under Gouken to become a better fighter.

One day, during a sparring match with his friend Ken, Ryu is soundly defeated by his rival, with the latter revealing that he discovered the secret to becoming a true fighter shortly after having defeated Gill. From this point on in the story, Ryu decides to travel throughout the world to find out exactly how to become a true fighter.

In the chapters, Ryu is chosen by the \"Capcom Association\" to face Tokita Ohma of the Kengan Association in a battle to determine which association was stronger. Briefly prior to entering the arena, Ryu talks with the \"Fang of Metsudo\" who asks him which one would be fighting, but Ryu merely avoids the question and states he fights for the power to win rather than the power to destroy. In their fight, despite initially seeming to match Ohma blow-for-blow, Ryu was taken down after having his Metsu Shoryuken redirected and getting punched in the chest. However, this merely caused the Dark Hado to awaken within him, bringing forth Evil Ryu. Quickly overwhelming Ohma in his augmented state, Evil Ryu floors his opponent after hitting him with a point-blank Metsu Hadoken. Acknowledging that his opponent still had more left, Ohma returns to his feet after taking out an \"advance\". With Ohma racing towards him, Evil Ryu then launched another Metsu Hadoken but Ohma skilfully avoided it and launched a flurry of hits before knocking out Ryu for good. Ohma then woke up alongside his manager Yamashita Kazuo, realising his encounter with Ryu had only been a dream.Live Action Films Street Fighter  In the live action movie adaptation of the games, Ryu's place as the main character of the series is replaced by Guile as the military leader of the Allied Nations Shadaloo branch. Ryu (with the last name of Hoshi), along with Ken, are two con artists who love to take money from rich crime lords through their schemes. This time, however, they unwittingly become entangled in the war to free the country of Shadaloo. Unlike in the games, comics and animes, Ryu is the most inaccurate representation in every aspect of the character in the film, he is no more than a simple street brawler with no secretly tapped abilities. The only visual representation of what may be the Hadoken is during a side-story fight with Vega nearing the climax to the film. It is represented by the screen going white for a brief moment as Ryu screams with his hands in the traditional Hadoken stance. In that regard, it is shown in the film that Vega, not Sagat, is Ryu's rival. His name is pronounced \"Rai-you\" instead of its traditional and more accurately pronounced \"Ree-you\". His name is pronounced correctly only twice out of the 14+ times it is spoken; once by M. Bison when ordering that he and Ken be given clean clothing after they are welcomed into the Shadaloo base, and once by Guile when commanding Chun-Li and Balrog to find Ryu and Ken during the final battle.Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li  While Ryu doesn't make a physical appearance in the film, he is mentioned by Gen at the end as a potential recruit for the Order of the Web.

Ryu was found as a young boy wandering in the forest near Gouken's dojo, unable or unwilling to speak, and was brought to Gouken to be raised. Usually emotionally closed off due to whatever traumatic experience led him to wander the forest, Ryu spontaneously taps into the Satsui no Hado during a bout with Ken; Gouken sends both students away to travel the world in the hopes of keeping Akuma from finding Ryu. A minor story about the origins of Ryu's theme is included.Street Fighter: Resurrection  Moh reprised his role as Ryu in Street Fighter: Resurrection.Street Fighter: World Warrior  Moh will reprise his role as Ryu in the second season, Street Fighter: World Warrior.Animations and movies Street Fighter  His story in the western\u00a0animated series is basically a loose combination of the two stories in the games and in the live-action film. Ryu, once again given the last name of Hoshi and replaced by Guile as the main character, is still a con man, as well as Ken, but despite this, he is still dedicated to his training. Unlike the film, Ryu has a rivalry with Sagat. During Fei Long's episode, Ryu has a cousin named Sachi who is being held captive along with her friend at Bison's hands before Guile and his group rescues them.Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie  Ryu trained with his best friend Ken as a teenager, rescuing him when the latter almost falls into a pit. Sometime after their training, Ryu said his farewells to Ken as he leaves in order to become a master of Ansatsuken.\u00a0A few\u00a0years later, Ryu battles against Sagat on a dark and stormy night; unbeknownst to them, they were being watched by a Shadoloo Drone. As the two appeared to be evenly matched, Sagat began to overpower Ryu, and went for a finishing blow; Ryu then charged up and unleashed a powerful Shoruken that catches Sagat in midair and floors him, leaving him scarred. Ryu then finally defeated Sagat with a Hadoken. Sometime after the battle, Ryu is at a tournament in Hong Kong, where he is hassled by everyone around him without apparent reason. He is forced into the tournament ring, where he quickly defeats his cocky opponent with a headbutt to the face. This is enough to impress one of the spectators - Fei Long, who entered the ring to test Ryu. Upon Ryu's victory, Fei Long began to tell him about the terrorist company known as Shadaloo and the man who had recently joined them - Sagat. Ryu ponders Sagat's fall from grace as he travels to India, where he watches a match between Dhalsim and E. Honda. The former suddenly sensed an unknown power coming from Ryu, occupying him long enough for Honda to get the upper hand. Dhalsim loses interest in the fight, however, and quits, still keen on learning of Ryu's power. As Ryu left, a young girl accidentally bumped into him; he then picked up a spilled milk bottle and, taking responsibility for it, gave her some money from his bag. When the girl returns and tries to give him his change, however, she was attacked by a group of thugs, prompting Ryu to retaliate and defeat them. As the goons were arrested, an officer informed Ryu that they were Shadaloo members. Ryu then checks on the little girl, who is in better condition, and tells her to keep the change; E. Honda claims half of the money, and then offers Ryu a chance to train with him. While the two train in Thailand, they are met by Guile via helicopter; the military officer tells them that Ken has been kidnapped by Bison. At this point, the Shadaloo mastermind, who was actually tracking them the entire time, arrives in his jet, accompanied by a brainwashed Ken. As Ryu is attacked by his friend-turned-foe, he refuses to fight back, causing Ken to fight back against bison's influence. Sensing this, Bison teleports behind Ken and tosses him off the side of the mountain. Bison then impedes Ryu's rescue attempt, belittling his morality and compassion and claiming that Ken may not even be alive. As the enraged Ryu then attacks, Bison tries to recruit him to Shadaloo, desiring to use his power to take over the world, but Ryu adamantly refuses despite the fighting slowly turning in the dictator's favor. Out of nowhere, Ken reappears and joins Ryu in the fight against Bison; the duo are able to weaken him and defeat him with a combined Hadoken, reducing Bison to a sphere of Psycho Power which is then hit by his Shadaloo jet, causing it to explode. Sometime later, Ryu says his goodbyes to Ken once more as he prepares to leave to another adventure, but he is surprised by the reappearance of Bison, who attempt to run Ryu down with a truck.

She asked him about where he was going, and he told her that he was going to pay his respects to his master. As he remembered how the dojo has change, he has a dream about Akuma. Thinking that Akuma has come to fight him, Ryu started to get into a fighting pose. He woke up from the nightmare, realizing that it was just a dream. He is later on tested by a monk would saw his fighting potential. Ryu eventually loses the match against the monk, which was impressed by him and invited him to dinner at his own home. As they ate, the monk told Ryu about Akuma, and Ryu told that he saw Akuma when he was still a child. As the talk continued, Ryu saw the same woman that he witness from before. At some point, he came across Sakura who was looking for him. Ryu was asked by Sakura to have a match with her, he did so in hopes of improving himself. After the matched, Sakura thanked him for it. Feeling that he was ready to face Akuma for his wrongdoings, Ryu is told by the monk where to find him. When he finally sees Akuma and begins to challenged him, as they fought, Ryu realizes this skills are not going well against Akuma. He then starts to fail into the influence of the Satsui no Hado and attacks Akuma, as he begins to perform the Raging Demon. He is then stopped by a flower wich reminds him of Fuka. Akuma told him that he has lost his desire to be powerful due to his love that he has for his master, Ryu told him that it has made him powerful. Akuma then attacked him, but Ryu is able to block it with his own ki, which begins to purify him of his Satsui no Hado, and giving back some of Akuma's humanity. The movie ends as Ryu continues to travel around the world.Street Fighter II V  Here, Ryu appears as a 17 year old who travels with Ken for the early part of the series, and has yet to learn the Hadoken as part of his original fighting style. After being trounced in a bar fight with Guile, he and Ken decide to travel the world, teaming up with Chun-Li. In the climax of the anime, Ryu is the one who defeated Bison who eventually learns more of his techniques such as Shoryuken and the Tatsumaki before he finish him off with a single Hadoken. In the end of the anime, Ryu leaves by ship as he departs from America to Japan. Unlike his game counterpart, Ryu has blood relatives in the anime which he has a younger sister named Rinko and an unnamed grandfather. Some of his attacks from his fighting style throughout the anime are not yet learned in each episodes until he masters Hadoken at Dhalsim's tutelage and later both his Shinku Tatsumaki and his Shoryuken during the climax fight against Bison after Ken unleashes his own Shoryuken.Cameos Wreck-It Ralph  Ryu makes three cameo appearances in Disney's 52nd Animated film, Wreck-It Ralph, with Kyle Hebert reprising his voice role in the film. First, a 16-bit Ryu and Ken notice that the arcade is closed and decide to take a break and head off to the Tapper bar. Later, a computer-animated Ryu can be spotted as one of the customers the Root Beer Tapper has to serve. Then, Ryu can be seen passing by Ralph for a couple of seconds as Ralph is looking for a medal. Finally, he is seen in the credits in the car-breaking bonus stage alongside Wreck-It Ralph. Ironically, in the Japanese version of the movie, he is voiced by Taketora, the current Japanese voice actor of Akuma.Other appearances Street Fighter EX series Background  After having defeating Sagat in the original Street Fighter tournament, Ryu's first official tournament ever, Ryu wondered about the strange sensation that overcame him in the final moments of the battle. Unsatisfied with the loss of control over his own emotions, he began to think long and hard about what it meant to be a fighter. He wandered around Asia, training in solitude, and encountering a few fighters. He heard about the EX tournament, and wondered if he was truly disciplined enough to enter another tournament. Shortly before making his decision, he met another roaming fighter. He was mild-mannered, and seemed to be just as troubled as Ryu. His name was Kairi, and Ryu suggested that they spar. They sparred for a long period of time, and Ryu began to feel enthusiastic about the chance to compete again. Ryu thanked Kairi for the sparring session and suggested that Kairi consider entering the tournament as well, in hopes that they might be able to face off for real. When Ryu arrived at the tournament, he watched every match that he could, and remained as focused and disciplined as ever throughout his own fights. Between one of his matches, he sensed a presence approach him. He turned around to gaze into the red eyes of a man in a dark gi and equally red hair. Ryu demanded to know what he wanted. The man paused, examining Ryu as if sizing him up. He let out a sigh of disappointment, and announced that his name was Akuma, he killed Ryu's master, and Ryu was not ready to confront him. Without giving Ryu a chance to respond, he disappeared almost as quickly as he came. Overcome with anger at the thought of his master's murder, he was filled with rage and began to seek Akuma's whereabouts. But before he could leave the arena, he was confronted by the tournament's host, M. Bison. Bison wanted to know if Ryu would like to join his Shadaloo army. Ryu had no interest in joining anyone's army and simply wished to pursue Akuma. Bison would not permit his refusal or his exit. With anger in his heart and no alternative, he attacked Bison with ferocity. Bison, intrigued by the young fighter's rising energy levels, teased and inflicted pain on the fighter to encourage a reaction. It did not take long for Ryu's murderous intent to overtake him, and soon Ryu was more monster than fighter. Bison halted the match, and promised this altered Ryu that if Ryu accepted Bison's offer, he would have the opportunity to destroy the man who killed his master. Fueled by anger and revenge, Ryu accepted. Bison decided to test Ryu's resolve, and knew that the man Ryu was assigned to fight next was the man he trained with as a boy for many years and who he considered to be his one true friend, Ken. Ken was enthusiastic about the opportunity to fight against his best friend and rival Ryu, but when he stepped in the ring, he noticed immediately that Ryu was not himself, and that he was possessed by some anger that overtook his mind. Ken tried to snap Ryu out of it, but nothing Ken tried would work. Eventually Ken announced that he would no longer fight Ryu, but Ryu continued to press his attack. With every strike, Ken shouted to Ryu in an effort to wake him up. Over a period of time, memories of Ken flooded Ryu's mind, and he slowly returned to normal. Realizing what had happened, he apologized to Ken, and was ashamed of himself for losing control over his mind. Ken forgave him, but before they could enjoy their reunion, M. Bison appeared. Disgusted with Ryu's lack of commitment, he decided to destroy both of the fighters. They attacked Bison in unison and succeeded in beating Bison into submission. Just as the match seemed to be over, Chun-Li and Guile burst into the arena, and Bison pressed a switch that caused him to disappear below the floor. Ryu had gained a better understanding of the power that lay within him, and decided to train harder to keep it under control. He joined the second EX tournament, where he was able to rematch Sagat. He did not win the bout, but he considered it a success because he did not tap into Satsui no Hadou in order to beat Sagat. When the third tournament was announced, Ken quickly contacted Ryu and asked him to be his partner. He accepted, but not before the little school girl name Sakura that he met in the first tournament begged him to be her partner instead. Sorry to disappoint the little girl, he accepted Ken's offer.Endings Street Fighter EX  The eternal challenger, Ryu. Will his battle ever end?

I will come to see you when the time comes\" \"Umm... But I don't like to wait!\" Suddenly Sakura starts to run...Street Fighter: The Storytelling Game  Ryu has a secret love for Chun Li, but he tries to forget it in order to devote more of their training. In this game's backstory, Ryu was originally trained in Karate by his mother, who taught him the basics and then enrolled him in Gouken's dojo.Gameplay Fighting style  Ryu's fighting style is generally referred to as Shotokan, despite the relative lack of resemblance to the real-life martial art. His normal attacks however, seem to resemble the martial art somewhat, especially with some aspects of Hapkido via the in-depth names of his normals in most Japanese sources. His take on the unnamed Ansatsuken style added with his own take on Shotokan, focuses on powerful singular strikes that usually knock the foe down, and is centered around his trademark Hadoken.Moveset  Ryu is available in every single Street Fighter game as the quintessential \"basic\" character of the series: an all-around fighter with an intuitive array of punches and kicks and basic special moves that are easy to pick up. Though this simplicity grants a lot of offensive mobility, it hampers his combo ability quite a bit, especially when compared to characters such as Ken, and renders him fairly predictable against more advanced players. Many of his attacks are reliable if a bit slow, and they are generally safe (or at least neutral) on block. The relative lack of changes to his moves compared to various other characters make him a solid choice for learning a given game's ins and outs. With fairly 'straightforward', easy-to-use moves at his disposal, he can even become a viable option in high-level play in the hands of a player able to read their opponent well. Ryu's fighting style is also known to be similar to how he works in the games; a reliable tool-set that barely changes bit by bit each time. It is often in Ryu's nature to stick to the fundamentals, playing to his more consistent techniques he's refined throughout the years, and often seeks to master while tweaking it by small bits. This categorizes him in the \"boring, but practical\" group of things, but his knowledge of all of his basic techniques makes him confident in any fight. Another notable weakness tends to be Ryu's lack of physical range, making it difficult for him to safely poke out other characters with footsies due to the range of his normals, often forcing him to rely on zoning with his Hadoken or to use his slow-startup Senpukyaku command normal to approach and stuff attacks. However, in later games, this problem seems to be mitigated, especially in games where he's aged and in most of his current 3D appearances. Ryu seems to retain his role as the balanced fighter in Street Fighter V, and his fighting stats reflect this;Techniques  Ryu's standard special attacks are the Hadoken, generally referred to as the Fireball; the Shoryuken, or Dragon Punch; and the Tatsumaki Senpukyaku or Hurricane Kick. In later versions of Street Fighter II, Ryu is able to perform the Tatsumaki Senpukyaku in the air, and gains the ability to use a more powerful Hadoken that is an actual fireball. In the Alpha series, he has a tactic known as the Hado no Kamae, a false Hadoken stance designed for fooling the opponent. In the Street Fighter III series, Ryu gains the Joudan Sokutogeri, a powerful side kick that shoves opponents away with great force. In the Street Fighter EX series, his Tatsumaki Senpukyaku is replaced with a flying kick attack which can be done in succession by inputting the same command twice or three times. In Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, he gains the Ren Hadoken (a compact Hadoken which can be rapid fired 5 times), the Baku Hadoken (an exploding Hadoken that causes the opponent to wall bounce), and the Hado Shoryuken (a Shoryuken infused with a Hadoken that hits 2-4 times). In Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix, Ryu's special attacks take on electrical properties when his Shoryuken are embedded with electricity, and feature the fewest and least drastic costume changes in the game (as he only equipped with single blue boxing glove and a geta sandals to either knock his opponent or taking his opponent down in a powerful assault). He also has a Mighty Combo called the Reppuu Jinrai Shou, a multi-hitting punch combo that ends with a Shoryuken. His other Mighty Combo is a powerful Shinku Tatsumaki as he was embedded with a thunder storm during execution. He also retains his Shinku Hadoken serving as one of his Mighty Combos. In Street Fighter V, Ryu retains most of his moves in the previous games. His V-Trigger is the Denjin Renki where Ryu powers himself up as both of his fists are embedded with electricity as he can shoot his Hadoken in electric properties and can stun his opponent with his Shoryuken in electric damage.Super Combos  Many of Ryu's Super Combos are more powerful versions of his normal moves. His trademark Shinku Hadoken is a five-hit Hadoken, and the first Super Combo in the series. The Shin Shoryuken is a close-range high-powered uppercut, and the Shinku Tatsumaki Senpukyaku is a multi-hitting kick. In Street Fighter III, Ryu can use the Denjin Hadoken Super Art, a ball of pure energy that can be charged to deal more damage, hits and stun damage. The Shinku Tatsumaki Senpukyaku is now his EX Tatsumaki. Ryu has a unique ability in Marvel vs. Capcom, where he is able to change his fighting style (and outfit) to those of Ken and Akuma (to compensate for the lack of the two characters in the game). In Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, Ryu gains the ability to temporarily enhance his fighting power through a Hyper Combo called Hado Kakusei which not only increases his speed by 15%, but also upgrades his other Hyper Combos as well. In Street Fighter V, Ryu's Shinku Hadoken serves as his Critical Art while his Denjin Hadoken also serves as his second Critical Art when his Denjin Renki V-Trigger was activated.Popular Culture  Ryu/Pop CultureTrivia Sprites  Ryu/SpritesSee also External links References Chun-Li  Chun-Li (\u6625\u9e97 or \u30c1\u30e5\u30f3\u30ea\u30fc, Shunrei or Chunr\u012b, Simplified Chinese: \u6625\u4e3d) is a video game character from the Street Fighter series, originally debuting in Street Fighter II. The first female fighter in the series, she is an expert martial artist and Interpol officer who relentlessly seeks revenge for the death of her father at the hands of M. Bison.Biography Name  Chun-Li's name is Mandarin for \"spring beauty\" (\u6625 ch\u016bn, \"spring\"; \u9e97 l\u00ec, \"beautiful\"). It is properly romanized as Chunli in pinyin and pronounced \"Chuen-lee\", despite westerners commonly pronouncing it as \"Chuhn-lee\". The Japanese on'yomi reading of the name is Shunrei. Older official sources from the early 90's indicate Chung was Chun-Li's surname, although it is worth noting this could very well not be the case anymore. In the live-action Street Fighter movie, Chun-Li was given the surname Zang/Xiang, but Capcom has not officially recognized it. Several Japanese drama CDs and novels created based on the series have given her surname as both \"Feng\" (\u6953, \"Feng\") and \"Wang\" (\u738b, \"Wang\"), though these are also not officially recognized by Capcom.Appearance  Chun-Li's appearance has differed several times in the Street Fighter series, as well as in official art and cameos she has made in other works. She is known for her very muscular thighs.Clothing  Chun-Li wears a qipao, a Chinese dress imported over from Manchuria that became popular among girls during the early 20th century. Her outfit is modified to allow a far wider range of movement than a normal qipao. She also wears white combat/boxing boots of varying height (around calf-length in games such as the Street Fighter II series and older vs. Capcom titles, or around knee-high in games based around her 3rd Strike sprite) and a blue leotard with dark brown sheer pantyhose and a blue thong underneath with her qipao. Her qipao is blue with golden accents. She was originally supposed to wear a peach-colored qipao, as seen in her in-game profile and ending in the original Street Fighter II. Large spiked bracelets, whose ring is black steel and spikes are white/chrome polished steel are worn on both arms. According to supplementary materials, she wears the qipao in honor of her late mother, who passed away in her early childhood and whose only photo showed her in a qipao similar to her daughter's. The spiked metal bracelets she is known to wear are made of iron, and weigh approximately 7-10 kg (15-22 lbs) each. Chun-Li also wears them to help tone and exercise her body; the qipao is fitted with weights to help build body strength and finesse, while her bracelets are for the purpose of balancing her body when performing her kicking moves, including helping stabilize her center of gravity during a Hyakuretsukyaku and limit her during supers such as the Senretsukyaku to avoid overexerting her muscles. The spikes are also used for the purpose of intimidation. During the period covered in Street Fighter Alpha, she wore an embroidered vest, unitard and athletic shoes, as well as studded wristbands. It is somewhat unclear why she chose to stop using this outfit and switch to the qipao in subsequent Street Fighter games; materials state that this was worn during her days as an active detective for comfort. In the Street Fighter Alpha: The Animation movie, her vest has changed to red instead of blue. Her Alpha costume became her \"Nostalgia\" costume in Street Fighter V. In Street Fighter II V, Chun-Li has seen wearing casual outfits throughout the episodes, including a red sleeveless v-neck qipao with a blue obi and it's ribbons are hanging loose at the right side, red Chinese pants, black Chinese shoes, her hair is tied in a high ponytail adorned with a long blue laced ribbon and a yellow formal sleeveless short dress adorned with orange lined ribbons (which resembles a skirt at the back), pink panties underneath and yellow open toed flats. When she was brainwashed, she wore her primary outfit but with minor changes, the color of her qipao is light blue with white accents, the front and back skirt are short instead of long, her brown pantyhose is replaced with blue kneepads and her hair is let loose. In Street Fighter IV, Chun-Li's alternate outfit consists of a black sleeveless evening gown with gold accents at the bottom. She wears a black and gold sash held by a red rope-like belt. The outfit is completed with red shoes, gold earrings and black and gold bracelets. The outfit resembles the clothes she wore in one of the episodes in the cartoon series. In various official art, she has also been shown in her police outfit, as well as (presumably) her favorite casual attire: a varsity-style jacket, T-shirt, jeans and white tennis shoes. It has been shown in some official art that when wearing her casual attire she also wears her Alpha wristbands. In Street Fighter V, her first alternate costume\u00a0is the\u00a0sleeveless evening gown from Street Fighter IV and her hair is now loose.\u00a0Her second is\u00a0her police uniform, which is also paired with white featureless boots akin to her prior signature ones. She gains new alterations of her main outfit and her police uniform; Her main outfit is similar to the one she wore in Street Fighter II V but in a sleeveless modified qipao with gold decorations and she wears black thigh-high socks and sneakers instead of kneepads and boots. Her police uniform is her disguise form in Pocket Fighter as color of her outfit is indigo and her top now shows her midriff with the black mini vest and the sign \"Police\" on front and her pants and boots are black. She no longer wears a beret and her hair is tied in unadorned ox-horns.Hairstyle  Her hairstyle is called \"ox horns\", a typical style in which Chinese children dress their hair; depictions of girls in Chinese paintings frequently show girls in ox horns. During the Alpha series, she chose to wear them unadorned, while in the remaining games, she uses silk brocades and ribbons to cover them, colored white to signify the mourning of her father. These silk brocades and ribbons that cover them are sometimes called bao. In Street Fighter IV, when wearing her alternate costume, she wears her ox horns unadorned, just like in her Alpha appearance, only this time it's held by red ropes with golden balls at the tip, and it's not braided. This style of ox-horns is also called as odango in Japanese. In Street Fighter II V, Chun-Li wore her hair up in one in a bun or sometimes in a ponytail. Later, when Bison brainwashed her, Chun-Li's hair was let loose.Personality  Chun-Li is a resourceful and dedicated\u00a0officer\u00a0of the law\u00a0with a strong sense of justice that rivals that of her father, as she strongly believes in protecting the innocent and saving\u00a0the lives of others. She is a highly disciplined, seasoned, and courageous woman, and is often the voice of reason. As an\u00a0official of Interpol, she takes her work as a cop with pride (showing pride at what she does when she saves another), outside of her duty as a cop,\u00a0she has an elegant, sweet, and feminine personality. Chun-Li, however, is\u00a0not without her flaws,\u00a0as she\u00a0has\u00a0shown to get\u00a0very competitive with\u00a0criminals\u00a0in Street Fighter\u00a0media, and does not take kindly to those who insult her pride as a cop. There are also times she is shown to have a fairly dense side to her personality, as shown in her ending of Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix. As pointed out by Nash and Guile, Chun Li tends to let her emotions get the best of her while on duty, this has at least on one occasion almost caused her demise at the hands of Bison. As shown in her story mode and in Shadowfalls Chun Li has been told this and she has promised not to do it again while it keeps happening. Because of her devotion to justice, she often becomes allies and friends\u00a0with other soldiers and cops. Additionally, she has shown great resilience and determination in pursuing intense crime organizations, such as Shadaloo.Character Relationships Allies Ryu  Ryu is one of Chun-Li's most trusted allies and closest friends. Chun-Li deeply admires Ryu for his strong determination and will to never give up in his fights and goals. Ryu seems to respect Chun-Li as well for her great fighting abilities.Cammy  Cammy and Chun-Li are great friends and usually stay in contact with each other. They mention each others' names frequently and usually team up with Guile when it comes to fighting Shadaloo. Chun-Li is also the one whom Cammy normally asks about \"normal\" life, such as when she asks Chun-Li about whether the bond between Laura and Sean can be considered a typical sibling relationship. She also consults Cammy about why Ken was fighting for his family instead of staying behind and protecting them. Chun-Li states that there are some that cannot be avoided, especially when you must protect someone, similar to how her father. In Street Fighter x Tekken, Chun-Li and Cammy are unique partner. The two of them worked together to discover the secrets of the Pandora Box, as well as investigate why Shadaloo and the Mishima Zaibatsu are attempting to secure it.Gen  \ufeffHer old teacher, and her father's friend. He was the person that hinted at Bison killing her father. However, in SFIV he didn't want to give her more answers. She tries to force him to tell her, but is unable. She is currently unaware of what seems to be his death at Akuma's hands during the events of\u00a0A Shadow Falls.Guile  Her longtime friend and partner. Both share a mutual hatred towards M. Bison.Karin  Karin and Chun-Li are good friends. In a win quote against her, Karin states that some of her moves were inspired by Chun-Li. Chun-Li takes part in Karin's plan to destroy Shadaloo and take down M. Bison.Enemies Crimson Viper  Crimson Viper is one of Chun-Li's rivals, mostly because C. Viper \"impeded\" Chun-Li's investigation on Shadaloo and S.I.N. Chun-Li almost blew C. Viper's cover (her working for S.I.N.) and tried to take her in. It is unknown who won the battle between C. Viper and Chun-Li, but\u00a0it is known that Chun-Li recovered data linking to Shadaloo and S.I.N.\ufeffJuri  Chun-Li failed to arrest her twice for brutalizing the Dolls, the first being during the SSFIV OVA, and the second being in Chun-Li's rival cusctene in SSFIV. As much as she sees Chun-Li hating her, Juri enjoys mocking her more, even suggesting that Chun-Li has a \"schoolgirl crush\" on her.Balrog  Even though Balrog has a thing for women, Chun-Li is one exception. As a member of Shadaloo and one of Bison's top subordinates, Chun-Li hates him as well.Vega  Vega enjoys her beauty and mocking her. In\u00a0SFIV\u00a0he calls her a persistent wench and tries to play her mind calling himself a ghost. In\u00a0SFV, he and Chun-Li battle off trying to learn more about her father but Vega escapes, he has even threatened to kill her.M.Bison  Chun-Li has a huge hatred for Bison, mostly because he killed her father.Akuma  Chun-Li is aware of the threat Akuma possesses.Gill  Gill is among Chun-Li's most hated enemies.F.A.N.G  As the second-in-command of Shadaloo, F.A.N.G is one of Chun-li's greatest enemies.Urien  Chun-Li despises Urien for kidnapping a girl from her orphanage to experiment on her.Gameplay  Chun-Li is the original fast character in the Street Fighter series, utilizing multiple rapid attacks rather than the slow damaging strikes of larger characters like Zangief. Her agile and swift movements are a favorite amongst game-players. It is interesting to note that in the early days of arcade fighting games, many other female characters played in a similarly speedy style, following the example set by Chun-Li. In previous games (mainly\u00a0Street Fighter II) she was basically a charge character along with Guile and E. Honda but her style was changed in later games to give her a more technical feel as well as her trademark \"speed\" granted to the player. Much of her basic moves involved brute force mixed with agility for a mixed fighting style in many cases, while also focusing on Chun-Li's thigh-build giving her various types of kicking attacks. However, as the games progressed as of Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike, Chun-Li's animations began to deviate from her original ones, and she adopts a more graceful approach to her martial arts (with some versions of her crouching stance instead making assume a lotus position of sorts). Another notable trait of Chun-Li's was her various unique attacks that often varied from iteration to iteration, with only a few iconic ones being consistent in her arsenal.Techniques  In almost every game, Chun-Li's signature move is the Hyakuretsukyaku, which was her ability to throw multiple kicks in one sitting. Its easy accessibility (bluntly pressing a kick button rapidly) has become a staple in many games. Her Spinning Bird Kick acts like Ryu's and Ken's own Tatsumaki Senpukyaku. Chun-Li can also wall-jump, meaning that pressing in the opposite direction after touching the wall during a jump will allow her to bounce off of it. While jumping, she can perform a Stomp Kick on top of her opponent's heads. Beginning with Street Fighter Alpha, this move was replaced by the Sen'enshu, which was an overhead drop kick which knocked the opponent down. This, in itself, was replaced by the Hazanshu in Street Fighter III, which was a similar move where Chun-Li flipped in the air before attacking with her overhead kick. She also regained her Spinning Bird Kick in that game. Her Kakukyakuraku was basically a move where she flips in the air and drop kicks her opponents on the head, causing them to fall down. This was replaced in Street Fighter III with the \"Tenshin Shuu Kyaku\" which requires her to jump all the way behind the opponent to attack, but also lets her combo afterward. Her trademark projectile is called the Kikoken, and has alternately been a motion attack and a charge attack depending on the game. Her Tenshokyaku enabled her to jump in the air and perform 3-4 consecutive kicks that can damage air born opponents. Other notable moves that have appeared include the Sou Hakkei, a powerful palm strike that Chun-Li can do in her X-ISM mode in Street Fighter Alpha 3; the Reishiki Kikou Ken, a toned-down version of the Kikosho as it appeared in the Alpha games that Chun-Li can do at any time in the Marvel vs. Capcom\u00a0series; and the Tenshin Embu in SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos, a command grab similar to Yun and Yang's Zenpou Tenshin that does no damage but leaves the opponent open to a combo. In Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix, Chun-Li retains most of her moves as both Kikosho and Hazan Tensho Kyaku serve as her Mighty Combos and has five disguises serve as her special attacks but one of those moves makes herself recoiled. (Eg: a summer school uniform while wielding a golf club and a love letter, a cheerleader wielding pom-poms and a baton stick, a circus performer, cosplaying as Jill Valentine in her first outfit in Resident Evil wielding heavy firearms and a traffic enforcer) One of her special attacks has to bump her opponent by sliding into the ground. She later wears a black sleeveless formal chinese qipao serving as one of her taunts. One of her Mighty Combos has her to slam the opponent with a traffic sign while disguising as a traffic enforcer to make the bikers from the Alpha games to hit and run the opponent for a heavy damage.Super Attacks  Chun-Li's first Super Combo, the Senretsukyaku, was an extended Hyakuretsukyaku that moved Chun-Li forward and could go through fireballs. Her Kikosho, which she received in Street Fighter Alpha, was a stationary ball of energy that could hit attacks coming from above and in front. Her Hazan Tenshou Kyaku was a powered-up version of the Tenshokyaku. These moves received typical power increases in the Marvel vs. Capcom series. Her appearance in Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike saw her retain only one Super Combo from before, the Kikosho, in a version that more resembled the Vs. version than the original Alpha version. Her two new Super Arts were the Houyoku Sen, a re-imagined Senretsukyaku that was made up of two flurries of rapid kicks followed by a final kick that sent the opponent upward; and the Tensei Ranka, an aerial flip-kick that ended with a final kick crashing straight downward. In Street Fighter IV, Chun-Li gains a new Ultra Combo called Hosenka. It is very much like Houyoku Sen, except instead of kicking the opponent away after the Hyakuretsukyaku, she kicks the opponent upwards and does a powered-up Spinning Bird Kick, which causes a tornado and does significant damage. She then kicks the opponent up into the air with a lot of force, landing gracefully after the opponent falls back on to the floor. In Super Street Fighter IV, the Kikosho returns as Chun-Li's second Ultra Combo. The Kikosho animation is nearly identical to what is depicted in Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike. In crossover games, Chun-Li gains a Hyper Combo called Shichisei Senkuu Kyaku. Chun-Li passes through the opponent with a powerful kick. As the two are momentarily paused mid-air, the screen turns black and the kanji of the Hyper Combo's name appears on the screen, with the screen flashing afterwards.Story Early Life  At the age of five, Chun-Li saw her first classical Chinese play, Peking Opera, and her first Bruce Lee movie,  which fascinated her and also became part of the reasons why she started practicing martial arts. She began by learning Tai Chi. However, Tai Chi was much different from the gorgeous movements she remembered from Peking Opera. Soon afterwards, her father taught her Hongquan as well as various basic exercises from then on. With that, Chun-Li\u2019s skills in Chinese martial arts improved rapidly. Chun-Li used mostly kicks when fighting. This was something she picked up from her father, who was also said to have \"legendary legs.\" Chun-Li continued to develop her kick attacks, embracing techniques from a variety of fighting styles, such as Chinese martial arts, capoeira, battle karate, and taekwondo, thus eventually creating her own style. Chun-Li would later become a detective at the age of eighteen in hopes of finding her missing father. She later followed in her father's footsteps and become a narcotics investigator at the I.C.P.O (International Criminal Police Organization), also known as Interpol, working as the organization's anti-Shadaloo investigator. Chun-Li was known as the \"black sheep of the I.C.P.O.\", as she was investigating Shadaloo for the illegal sales of narcotics and weapons when said evil organization got their hold of the high-ups of Interpol.Street Fighter Alpha 2  Chun-Li was an Interpol investigator who had been searching for clues to the recent disappearance of her father. Getting into a friendly spar with an old teacher of hers and friend of her father, Gen, he gives her a lead into who may have killed her father\u2014the mysterious crime syndicate Shadaloo. Finding its leader, M. Bison, she demands he tell her what happened to her father. To her surprise, Bison attacks and basically makes quick work of her, then flies away, laughing at her and telling her if she attacks him again he will kill her just like he did her father. With tears in her eyes (the last she swore to ever shed), Chun-Li swore vengeance.Street Fighter Alpha 3  Chun-Li teamed up with a United States Air Force member, Charlie Nash, to try to track and take down Shadaloo. She then ran into someone she would not have expected at all. It was Charlie's good friend and fellow lieutenant, Guile. Telling Guile he should not get in over his head and to leave the two be, Chun-Li learns he has orders to bring Charlie back. Attempting to use force to stop him, Guile immediately appears and holds her in his arms telling her that she can't force Charlie to not make what is right and for good intentions; nonetheless, she insists that she and her partner be left alone, to which Guile replies that he will never abandon friends in need. After eventually learning that Bison tricked the Air Force into canceling the planned bombing of the main Shadaloo base, Chun-Li rushed over to the two soldiers to tell them they were tricked and would have to destroy the base on their own. Chun-Li with Charlie and Guile proceeded to the Shadaloo base located in Thailand to plant bombs around the base as Charlie and Guile headed inside to destroy the Psycho Drive, but Guile then came rushing out, grabbing Chun-Li and telling her Charlie had urged both of them to get away. Meanwhile, Ryu was fighting with M. Bison. Along the way Chun-Li saw a young girl escaping with several others (who turned out to be Cammy) and she found Ryu and escaped with him. Later Guile told her that Charlie was inside of the Shadaloo base during the explosion marking his apparent death in the process. Despite being distraught over the initial lack of evidence to prove Shadaloo's crimes, Chun-Li managed to shut down the operations of the Shadaloo evil empire.Street Fighter II  Chun-Li received an invitation to the second World Warrior tournament, and discovered that Bison had apparently survived the Thailand base's destruction. With this, she had the clear motive of destroying Shadaloo and avenging her father once again. During the tournament, Chun-Li and her allies manage to reach Bison and engage him in combat that reaches the forest. During their fight with Bison, They managed to overpower the Shadaloo dictator with Chun-Li weakening Bison with a powerful Kikosho that destroys part of the forest. When Guile urges Bison to surrender, Bison refuses and instead commits suicide by using all of his Psycho Power to make a huge explosion that blasted away, but didn't kill, Chun-Li and the other fighters who attempted to stop the dictator. With Bison's apparent suicide, the government exhaustively investigated Shadaloo's base and concluded that Bison and the other bosses had also died, despite no evidence being shown to prove that the cataclysm happened.Pre-Super Street Fighter IV  Some time after the fall of Shadaloo, Chun-Li, Guile and Cammy are summoned to a theme park to stop the rampage of Juri (a operative from Shadaloo's weapon division S.I.N.) who is wreaking extreme havoc. While Guile and Cammy try to evacuate the civilians still trapped, Chun-Li faces Juri just as she executes a rogue S.I.N agent and a woman. Juri seriously injures Chun-Li but before she can execute her, she is forced to flee when Guile and Cammy arrive due to her artificial eye malfunctioning. Guile later informs Chun-Li about their failure to apprehend Juri.Street Fighter IV series  Donning her outfit, she returns to Interpol and teams up with Guile and Cammy to take down S.I.N. and discover what really happened to M. Bison. After she recovers from being defeated by Juri Han, she enters the new international fighting tournament to take down S.I.N once and for all. On her way, she is approached by Abel, who is searching for any leads on the Shadaloo organization. During the tournament, she also pursues Gen, who is also participating, for more answers about her father's death; Gen refuses and she is unable to force him. She then confronts C.Viper and almost blows her cover because Viper was \"impeding\" her investigation. \u00a0Later she encounters Juri once more, who she tries to arrest and although she is able to defeat her she is unable to bring her into custody. Infiltrating the S.I.N. dam facility, she is trapped when Vega activates the base's self-destruct sequence. She is protected from the ensuing collapse by Gen, and is eventually rescued by Guile and Abel.Street Fighter V  As expected, Chun-Li returns in Street Fighter V.Prologue  The prologue takes place after A Shadow Falls, where Chun-Li successfully rescues Li-Fen from Shadaloo. While caring for Li-Fen, she finds Chun-Li's old gear from the Alpha series. Chun-Li recounts her past events while tying ox-horns on Li-Fen's hair. The past shows Chun-Li trying to arrest Vega in China. During a fight, she gets scratched by his claw. Vega says her kicks remind her of someone who practiced the same art. Chun-Li recognizes that person as her father and asks Vega about him, but he flees. She continues her search in Russia, where she meets Guile and Nash while in a rush. They tell her she needs to be more patient. She insists that she has reasons to go alone, but Nash wants to test her to see if she's ready, so they spar. Nash gets up after the fight, surprising her. Guile tells Chun-Li that if she's finding Vega, that he and Nash should come with her. They return to China and find Vega, who has an entourage of Shadaloo soldiers and Birdie. Guile and Nash fight off the attackers while Chun-Li fights Vega again. When she finally beats down Vega and tries to arrest him for questioning, he gets away on a helicopter and escapes, promising they'll meet again. She learns a lesson about not going alone and thank Guile and Nash for coming. Back in the present and Chun-Li has finished Li-Fen's ox-horns. Li-Fen wishes to be just as strong as Chun-Li and they start training.A Shadow Falls  In the main story, Chun-Li teams up with Guile in his investigation about the blackout in New York due to the activation of the Black Moons created by M. Bison. When she and Guile confront M. Bison along with the other Heavenly Kings, she recklessly fights against Bison over her vendetta. When she almost gets killed, Cammy comes in to save her just on time and retreats with her and Guile. They start discussing the possible connections of the missing hackers and believe the chess pieces are connected. Cammy gives Chun-Li one of them, but gets taken shortly after by Rashid after Guile tries to fight off Nash, now resurrected and also trying to grab the chess piece. Chun-Li is enlisted by Karin Kanzuki and find out the chess pieces are actually the keys to the Black Moons and to stopping Shadaloo's plan. She teams up with Ken Masters and Cammy to find Laura at Brazil. Once Ken fights off F.A.N.G, Chun-Li recognizes Sean as being part of the Matsuda Family and questions him about the chess piece he received, which he gave to Laura. After Ken spars with Laura and gets the piece, Decapre lingers to them and falls unconscious. Police show up to arrest Decapre. Ken and Chun-Li try to diffuse the situation, but Cammy attacks the officers to protect Decapre and escapes with Juri on her motorcycle now that she's a fugitive. In their first infiltration at Shadaloo, Chun-Li finds Li-Fen, one of the kidnapped hackers. She and Karin eventually succeed in shutting down the Black Moons, but F.A.N.G uses Li-Fen to make a back up by restarting the Moons and setting them to detonate and explode, causing her and Karin to escape with Nash. Ryu arrives after defeating Necalli and Chun-Li is happy to see him. He joins with them to make a final assault against Shadaloo. Rashid sucessfully aborts the detonation and Chun-Li and Guile find Nash and are forced to watch Charlie fight Bison until Charlie sacrifices himself to weaken Bison. She stops Guile from nearing the blast as Nash kills himself. She fights F.A.N.G after he survived Marz's attempt to kill him. She manages to knock him out to save Li-Fen. After Ryu ultimately defeats Bison, they escape the base with Li-Fen and Guile. Chun-Li tries her best to catch up to them. When the blast starts catching up, Ryu throws a Denjin Hadoken to stop the fires from the explosion allowing Chun-Li and Li-Fen to escape. Chun-Li is last seen watching the destruction of Shadaloo, finally avenging her father's death.Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike  After the events of Street Fighter V and Shadaloo's fall, Chun-Li finally makes her peace and retires from street fighting to teach martial arts to orphans while still doing police work. Urien kidnaps a young girl, Li-Fen, for his scientific projects, which prompts Chun-Li to go out in the world again and find her. She challenges him once she finds him and gets Li-Fen back. She goes back to China and goes back to teaching martial arts.Crossover appearances  Over the years, Chun-Li has appeared in almost all of Capcom's fighting games. With the release of Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike, she became the only character besides Ryu, Ken and Akuma to appear in all three major Street Fighter incarnations (Street Fighter II, Street Fighter Alpha and Street Fighter III). Chun-Li is a regularly-used cameo character in Capcom games. She makes a cameo appearance in Mega Man 9 as a television news reporter during a prologue scene where Mega Man and Dr. Light are watching a breaking-news report. She appears as a boss in the semi-official crossover Street Fighter X Mega Man. Mega Man can obtain the Hyakuretsukyaku as a weapon by defeating her. She is also seen during the ending of the DLC expansion Nirvana of Asura's Wrath, apprehending a reincarnated Kalrow; the game refers to her simply as \"Policewoman\".Crossovers  Chun-Li has appeared in all crossovers involving the series (i.e. Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes, SVC Chaos: SNK vs. Capcom, and Tatsunoko vs. Capcom). She is a playable character in the crossover RPG Namco x Capcom, eventually pairing up with Cammy. Chun-Li was also confirmed as a playable character for Street Fighter IV on December 7, 2007.

She has also made numerous appearances as playable characters in mobile games such as Granblue Fantasy, Shadowverse, and Power Rangers Legacy WarsShadow Lady  In Chun-Li's Marvel vs. Capcom ending, she is transformed into Shadow Lady, a playable boss who was easily recognized as a sprite swap for Chun-Li. Beyond the basic appearance, Shadow Lady had many unique moves in addition to Chun-Li's, due to being a cyborg. This includes transforming her hands into a spinning drill, firing rockets and zapping enemies with electricity.Pocket Fighter  Chun-Li hears of an escaped zoo animal.

As Rita Repulsa's hold on the Morphin Grid stretches across multiverses, Chun-Li is among the warriors who are sucked into the Grid, pitted against those from the Power Rangers multiverse.Live Action Movies and Series Street Fighter  Chun-Li was featured in the live-action film Street Fighter (1994). Her character was portrayed by Chinese-American Ming-Na Wen (who would later voice Mulan in the Disney film). Rather than being an INTERPOL officer, however, Chun-Li Zang is depicted here as a news reporter\u00a0working for GNT News, in pursuit to seek revenge on M. Bison for causing her father's death. Other than her change of occupation, her personality remains the same.The Legend Of Chun-Li  In October 2006, Hyde Park Entertainment and Capcom announced its intention to produce another film adaptation with the storyline to focus on Chun-Li. This film will be more character-centered and story-based rather than following a \"nebulous plot.\"[1] Also, apparently it won't be just a Street Fighter movie with Chun-Li as the main character, along the lines of Guile in the first one, but it will be an actual Chun-Li film.[1] Screenwriter Justin Marks was attached to write a script for the adaptation. Street Fighter is set for a 2008 release for the 20th anniversary of the fighting game series.[2] The film adaptation was part of Capcom's multi-platform launch for 2008 that also launched video games and a potential TV series in 2008. Canadian actress Kristin Kreuk known for Smallville stepped down from the show to accept the role of Chun-Li in the 2009 adaptation.Resurrection  Chun-Li was mentioned in Street Fighter: Resurrection episodes \"New Challenger\" and \"Fight & Flight\".Street Fighter: World Warrior  Chun-Li will appear in the second season of Street Fighter: Assassin's Fist called Street Fighter: World Warrior.Animations Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie  Chun-Li was featured as a main character of the Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie. As an Interpol agent, she requests to work with Guile to investigate Bison's organization. Guile at first doesn't want to work with her, more eager to pursue Bison himself, but Chun-Li remains persistent and she teases him into openly attacking her to get the frustration out of his system and showcase her martial art abilities. She convinces Guile that it is more important to put personal feelings of revenge aside and instead be practical and focus on how to work together. The two remain essentially inseparable afterwards until Bison becomes aware of their activities. Despite her importance to the games, Chun-Li does not meet either Ryu or Ken or participate in the final battle against Bison in this movie, as she is ambushed in her apartment by Vega, Shadaloo's top assassin. After an intense battle, she manages to defeat him, but her injuries overwhelm her and she slips into a coma. A distraught Guile promises her he will bring Bison down and pursues the investigation without her, successfully tracking down Ryu minutes before Bison arrives. Following Bison's defeat at the hands of Ryu and Ken, Interpol tracks down Shadaloo and destroys its central headquarters. Chun-Li eventually awakens from her coma, and pulls a comical and cruel prank on Guile by making it appear she has died, before surprising him with a newspaper headline announcing the downfall of Bison's operations. The two celebrate with an embrace. In the original version Chun-Li was given a shower scene before her fight with Vega, which has been censored to varying degrees in all American releases. The recent re-release of the film by Manga Entertainment now offers both the \"uncut\" UK and original JP versions of the film.Street Fighter II V  In the 29-episode anime series, Chun-Li appears as the spirited tour guide to Ken and Ryu. Her character in this adaption is a far cry from the world's strongest woman since she is only 15 in this series, and is a Kung-Fu student under the guidance of her father, the highest-ranked police chief in Hong Kong. Chun-Li plays a sizable role in the finale when she is brainwashed by Bison's psycho power. She and Ken become something of an item during the Vega arc. She also challenges Bison to a fight and is defeated by him. Following this, she becomes one of Bison's brainwashed soldiers. It is not until after Bison is defeated by both Ryu and Ken that she regains consciousness again and reunites with the two fighters.Street Fighter (Animated Series)  In the American Street Fighter animated series, Chun-Li was a regular character and was voiced by Donna Yamamoto. Like in the games, she seeks to avenge her father's death, who was killed by Bison and like her movie counterpart, she also works as a news reporter instead of working at INTERPOL. She first appears in the first episode \"The Adventure Begins\" where she meets up with Guile, Ryu and Ken in Brazil to fight against M. Bison who was causing trouble with Lucinda and some other scientists who were trying to find a cure a disease that was plaguing the area. In \"The Strongest Woman in the World\" we learn that Chun-Li saw her father killed by Bison when he was the only person to stay and defend their village. Chun-Li is then put with the dilemma of either allowing Bison to escape or have a nuclear plant destroy many innocent people in her home country China and is forced to let him go so the innocent people can be protected. In \"Getting to Guile\" Chun-Li fought off El Fideo's best men in a street fight in order to obtain some information she needed but while waiting in her hotel room for the information she was called to save Guile from Bison's mind control.Street Fighter Alpha: The Animation  In Street Fighter Alpha: The Animation, Chun-Li is still an agent working for Interpol. She recently discovers that Shadaloo has a new leader called Professor Sadler. Chun-Li decides to team up with Ryu and Ken to get information about Sadler and the disappearance of her father. The story begins with Chun-Li encounting Ryu when she and Wallace her partner were fighting Shadaloo's henchmen. Ryu joins in to help them in their fight. Chun-Li, amazed by Ryu's strength and power, decides to seek information about him. She came across an old article on the internet about Ryu defeating Sagat the Muay Thai Emperor. \u00a0Wallace then reveals to her, that Shadaloo has a new leader called Professor Sadler who is coming to Japan to hold a street fighter tournament. Curious about this, Chun-Li decides to investigate this.Luckily she meets with Ryu again on the streets with his long lost brother Shun.Chun-Li introduces herself as they enter an elevator inside a building heading into the tournament. Chun-Li, Ryu and Ken watch on the side lines while Shun enters the tournament to show Ryu how powerful he is. Shun's opponent was Zangief, who he got beaten up badly by. In the process, Shun reveals that he also has the Dark Hado just like Ryu. Chun-Li has never seen this kind of power before, and became very curious about this strange, evil power. Ryu runs in to stop the fight, only to be beaten up by Zangief as well. Enraged, Ryu taps into the Dark Hado and was about to unleash it on Zangief, but stops when he came to his senses, missing Zangief and blowing up the building accidently. Later, Shun was kidnapped by Shadaloo,Chun-Li and Wallace try stopping them, but they got away. Chun-Li tells Ryu that Shun was abducted by Shadaloo. She then carries Ryu to Interpol Headquarters to question him about Shun and the Dark Hado. Wallace wonders where Shadaloo has taken Shun. Chun-li believes he's been taken to Sadler's lab, Ryu decides to find Shun with Chun-Li tagging along. Later, they meet with Ken to go to Sadler's second tournament for first class street fighters.While there, Ken realize that all the winners of the tournament are secretly being lead into Sadler's hideout by his henchmen. Curious, they investigate only to find out that the street fighters are being captured to have their data extracted. In the end, they discover that Sadler's goal is to become the strongest fighter alive by collecting different types of data from street fighters from around the world. However, his main goal was to extract the Dark Hado from Ryu. Sadler sent Shun to receive any useful information about Ryu, having Shun pretend to be Ryu's long lost brother to fool him. Though Chun-Li and Ken were beaten when they faced Sadler, Sadler met his demise at the hands of Ryu. After the ordeal was over, Ryu, Ken and Chun-Li went back to their separate ways, continuing to fight to become stronger. In the end, Chun-li still hasn't received any information about her father's disappearance.Street Fighter (Korean animation)  In the unofficial Korean animation made by Daiwon Animation, Chun Li appears as a supporter to the teenage protagonists Soryong Yi and Saeng Yegal.Wreck-It Ralph  In the 2012 Disney film, Wreck-It Ralph, Chun-Li makes a cameo appearance in the film, along with Ryu, Ken Masters, Zangief, M. Bison, Cammy, and Blanka.Comics and Manga Street Fighter II manga  In a Street Fighter II manga published in the early 1990s (written by Masaomi Kanzaki), Chun-Li remains in her established role of an interpol agent investigating Bison, but she constantly references and reflects a desire to earn the critical praise of Ryu as a fighter, she is also portrayed as a more emotional and light-hearted\u00a0person. As the manga progresses, she eventually participates in a tournament arranged by Shadaloo, and outlasts many of the other warriors, eventually coming up against Vega, portrayed here as her father's killer. Chun-Li defeats Vega, but as in the SF II movie, she cannot continue, and she is pulled from the tournament. Her injuries prevent her from doing much when Ryu and Bison confront one another, except call off an air strike by Interpol as the two fight. Chun-Li appears one final time in the closing pages of the final issue of the Manga in a panel illustration depicting her arrest of a drug peddler, she remains eager to prove herself to Ryu, and sends him a letter conveying that determination. Much like the anime SF II movie, the story stands alone from the established canon. Chun-Li's hero worship of Ryu was likely later used for the character of Sakura in the Alpha games.Street Fighter Alpha (manga)  In the manga based on Street Fighter Alpha, Chun-Li is again an agent of Interpol (as she is in almost all iterations save for the live action film). In the manga, she encounters Ryu, who has fallen from grace when he began to give in to the Satsui no Hado, and had hired himself out as a bodyguard to some drug smugglers. She winds up befriending Ryu and Birdie as well as Ken; and Chun-Li, Ken, and Ryu begin trying to deal with the Satsui No Hado, though Chun-Li plays mostly a minor role in that regard. However, the three friends encounter members of Shadaloo, and Chun-Li, at the end of the first volume of the manga, rescues Cammy from being captured (or possibly killed, the manga doesn't say which, only that losers are 'stored' somewhere) after having her hand apparently crushed or at least injured in some way by Sodom. Shadaloo in the manga is once again responsible for the death of her father, though the exact identity of the killer has yet to be revealed.Sakura Ganbaru!  Chun-LI makes an appearance in the second volume of the manga.Street Fighter III: Ryu Final  Although not a part of a story, Chun-LI makes a cameo appearance in the manga.Street Fighter Gaiden  In the manga, Chun-Li has her own short story on the first volume, based on the events of Super Street Fighter II Turbo. Her story begins in San Francisco, where she managed to defeat a group of drug dealers and was detaining them. Eliza stopped by and picked Chun-Li up as she was staying in the Masters residence during her investigation of a new drug created by Shadaloo called \"Spider\". She said Ken was away, participating in a Martial Arts tournament in Japan. Teaming up with the San Francisco Police Department, they discovered that one of the drug dealers they detained revealed the distribution routes of the drug. Chun-Li immediately jumped at the chance to capture the distributors and headed out of the station until she met an officer named Cain Zenigaya. The two found the hideout, which was, ironically, next door to Ken's house. As they went inside the house, they had noticed that the hideout was not heavily secured. They managed to go to the basement and were suddenly ambushed. Chun-Li easily subdued the thugs and found the creators of the \"Spider\" drug. She called Cain for some assistance until she suddenly felt pain. Cain revealed himself as a double agent for Shadaloo, calling himself the drug ring leader named \"Spider\" to lure Chun-Li into a trap and kill her. Using the drug in needles, Cain also said he had memorized her fighting style and purposely brought her to the basement to limit her abilities, which Chun-Li noticed that she was having some disadvantages in the fight. As this was going on, Eliza was watering her plants and saw Chun-Li heading inside her neighbor's home. As time passed, she began to worry and immediately went next door to check on her. She heard noises coming from the basement and went downstairs, calling for Chun-Li and found her fighting against Cain. She almost slipped as Cain directly threw his needles at her. Sensed that Eliza is in danger, Chun-Li slipped through the needles and attacked Cain with her Senretsukyaku and finished him off with Tenshoukyaku. At the end, Ken returned home, heard what had happened and berated Chun-Li that if Eliza was in danger again, she will never step foot into his home again. Eliza, however reassured him that the incident gave her more confidence on being a wife of a martial artist, which Ken was in a state of shocked. Chun-Li also appear on Cammy's second short story on the second volume. On both volumes, Chun-Li's personality is more lively and girly in which the author apologized to fans in her notes.Malibu Series  In the 1990s, Malibu Comics produced a short-lived series of Street Fighter comics, which featured Chun-Li as having known Ryu and Ken since at least their later teens, along with her having either a romantic involvement with or interest in Ryu. So far, it's the only comic or manga known to have shown Chun-Li with her hair down. The comic primarily focused not on Chun-Li or Ryu in particular, but rather on the reaction of several of the characters to the murder of Ken Masters. As this comic was never finished (it was canceled after only three issues), the storyline was never resolved, and no mention was made of Chun-Li's father or of her connections to Interpol. This series was apparently produced sometime before the release of Super Street Fighter II, as none of the characters introduced in that game appeared in it.Udon comics  Chun-Li becomes once again involved in the hunt for Shadaloo at her first year at Interpol with her father, However, it is not Bison who is the killer of Chun-Li's father personally by himself, but rather Killer Bee who was controling, prior to her being freed from Bison's control. Chun-Li battles Cammy when they meet face to face for the first time. Chun-Li winds up forgiving Cammy for her actions due to the fact that as she was a brainwashed servant of Bison's at that time, she was not responsible for the murder of Chun-Li's father, Bison was. As a result, she has turned her sights onto Bison in the hopes of attaining her revenge. Chun-Li's mode of dress changes several times throughout the series, from outfits worn in Street Fighter Alpha, to her more traditional qipao from the Street Fighter II games. She has received an invitation from Shadaloo to enter a tournament being held by Bison. After Bison's defeat, Chun-Li decited to take the role of a teacher like Gen, inspiring other kids to do what is right, much like her father did with her during her eairly years, at some point she discovered a secret Shadaloo base and was captured by VegaWorlds Unite  Chun-Li, along with various other Capcom and SEGA characters, is set to appear in the second Sonic the Hedgehog/MegaMan crossover comic, Worlds Unite. She is the first Street Fighter character to appear after being informed by Sticks that her would be taken over by a monsterous that known as Sigma and goes to help them out. However, at the end of the crossover, the events of this story was altered due to time being changed by Phane, making every character return back to their home world not and having no memeroy of Sigma nor the events of the story.Street Fighter X G.I. Joe  Chun-Li fights against an opponent who appears to be Dan who defeats her and is later revealed to be Zartan.Other appearances Street Fighter EX series Background  Since the storyline of Street Fighter EX is an alternate storyline, it takes place around the time that the event depicted in Street Fighter Alpha would have occurred. As such, M. Bison is very much at large, and in the process of building up his Shadaloo army. Freshly initiated into the interpol ranks, Chun-Li is in pursuit of M. Bison and all of the information that she can obtain about his army's whereabouts. However, many of Chun-Li's efforts are thwarted and she makes little progress in locating Bison throughout the tournament. Bison's attentions are on a particular martial artist known as Ryu. The situation is complicated further when Chun-Li is asked to return to the second EX tournament. She does not wish to go since it seems that M. Bison is not the one hosting the tournament, but rather a strange and unusual dictator named Shadowgeist. Her department wants her to investigate his activity, but her luck pays off when M. Bison returns, upset by the audacity that Geist displays in usurping Bison's tournament. Chun-Li manages to catch M. Bison and challenges him to a fight to avenge her father's death. Unbeknownst to her, Bison's Psycho Power had been enhanced by an attempted attack from Garuda, and she challenged him while he was in an unstable state, allowing him to defeat her quickly. She returned in the third EX tournament. This time, she was persuaded by Guile to be his partner in the search for M. Bison and Guile's missing commander, Charlie.Endings Street Fighter EX  \"How are you my father? I am fine myself.

Similiar to his friend Ryu, Ken's goal is to test his power against many different fighters and strives to become stronger, but holds more restraint due to not wanting to jeopardize his family life.Biography Appearance  Ken is most easily recognized by his brown sparring gloves (yellow in the Alpha series and red in the EX series) and bright red gi with the sleeves neatly removed, similar to Ryu's (Capcom has said that a red gi was chosen to stand out and to reflect his more flashy style of fighting[citation needed]) and it is usually seen in better shape than Ryu's (except for in the Street Fighter III series), since he can easily afford to keep up with and/or own spares. He has blonde hair and long black eyebrows. He wears a black belt at his waist and trains barefooted. In the Street Fighter Alpha series, he had longer hair tied into a ponytail with a red ribbon. The official explanation for the loss of the ribbon is that he gave it to Ryu to wear during the events of Street Fighter Alpha 2 (as stated in Ken's own ending); Ryu was distracted during his fight with Ken because he had just fought Sagat, and ended up losing. Ken gave Ryu the headband to remind him of their fight. In Street Fighter II V, Ken has red-hair similar to the live-action movie and the animated series along with fighting barehanded. Ken usually wears casual outfits throughout the episodes; for example, a yellow formal suit jacket with a red tank top, matching white pants with a black belt to his waist and black shoes. By the time of Street Fighter V, Ken's appearance has undergone the first major design change in the character's history. Ken's gi top now hangs around his waist and he wears a black v-neck training shirt with several red linings in its place. He sports black sparring gloves and his hair is now tied in a topknot. Most likely due to events yet undisclosed instead of hanging loose which it was grown into medium length after the events of Street Fighter IV series and now wears black ankle wraps with red linings instead of barefoot. His second alternate costume is one of his disguised forms in Pocket Fighter but updated; he wears a black leather jacket with maroon outlines and a white tank top underneath, red denim pants with a black belt, a neon yellow buckle on his waist and black leather shoes. His sunglasses are hanging loose on his tank top. His medium-length hair is shorter.Concept  Though unconfirmed, it is possible that Ken could have been inspired by real-life Karate world champion, Joe Lewis. Like Ken, Lewis was a blonde American who trained a traditional style in Japan, then went back to the U.S to become a famous champion. Lewis also founded Full Contact Karate and became a world champion at that as well. In addition to his similar looks, Lewis was also known (as were many American Karate fighters of his time) for using colored Karate uniforms, including a red one. He was challenging of traditional Karate ways and modified much of his original \"Shorin Ryu\" style, similar to Ken's modifications that distinguish him from Ryu, a traditional fighter. Originally only called \"Ken\", he gained his last name when toy company Hasbro got the license to add the characters from Street Fighter II to their G.I. Joe toyline. It is widely believed, though never confirmed, that the name was given to avoid copyright confusion with the character of the same name from Mattel's Barbie toyline.Personality  While Ryu is the more serious and stoic of the two, Ken is the complete opposite - stylish, unorthodox and unpredictable, as well as being much more violent and aggressive than Ryu. He is an alpha male with a giant ego and constantly reminds his opponents about his greatness. While he can be brash, egotistical, and arrogant at times, his heart is pure. He is generally kind, friendly, a good person, and very easygoing which led him into starting a family of his own. He never backs down from a fight no matter how difficult it looks. Like Ryu, he believes in honor, hard work, endurance, and discipline. He always gives his opponents (who are friendly rivals) the utmost respect, whether it is his master Gouken, his best friend Ryu, or his Capcom vs. SNK rival, Terry Bogard. He is also a worrywart when it comes to his family, nearly missing the tournament in Street Fighter IV because he didn't want to leave Eliza so close to her due date, and only entered when she assured him she'd be fine. He still called her to check in and tell her to be careful using stairs.Character Relationships Ryu  Ryu is Ken's best friend from his childhood, as the two have trained in the same art of Ansatsuken for a long time. They share a very close bond to each other and will help out each other no matter the cost. Both of them have also trained together under Gouken.Gouken  Like Ryu, Ken has immense respect for Gouken.Rufus  Rufus constantly fights Ken, but Ken keeps forgetting who he is.Sean  Ken highly respects Sean's abilities, enough to make him his personal disciple. Sometimes they can be sarcastic at each other and trade jabs but are at very good terms.Guile  He is Guile's brother-in-law, because his wife Eliza is the younger sister of Guile's wife Julia. He may or may not be aware that there's parts of him that Guile has reservations of, which doesn't stop both Ken and Guile from getting along though. Ken knows what Guile likes and frequently gives him interesting information, such as Yanagiya's J-GEL hair gel.M. Bison  Ken is aware of Bison's villainy and seeks to defeat him. During the events of Street Fighter II, Bison brainwashed Ken into Violent Ken.Akuma  Like Ryu, Ken is aware of the threat Akuma possesses over humanity.Dan  Ken is possibly aware that Dan was once their master's student, but due to Dan's jealousy arrogant and showboating nature, Ken doesn't think highly of him and considers him a nuisance to beat up. Even his wife doesn't have good things to say about Dan. Indirectly, this may have caused Sean to look down upon Dan too.Story Background  When Ken was about 12 years old, his father, a rich hotel tycoon owner, thought that his son needed to learn about discipline, or his son would become a spoiled brat all of his life and try to leech onto the Masters' family fortune. In order to do so, the elder Masters sent Ken to Japan to train under his best friend, the mysterious karate master Gouken. At first, Ken was very hesitant to learn from Gouken, wanting to go back to the United States, but later began to respect his master. He even enjoyed the company of Gouken's adopted son, Ryu, since he had a foil to finally pull pranks on, although this got Ken into a lot of trouble. Ryu and Ken would later become best friends and each other's principal rivals. When Ryu was 23, Gouken decided that both of his pupils had grown up to be fine fighters and decided that their training was over and could now leave the dojo. Ryu decided to travel the world in order to continue his training, whereas Ken was finally happy to be going back home to the United States after his years of straining his back for his master, Gouken, and finally learning the meaning of humility. After coming home, Ken competed in many different Martial Arts tournaments held in the United States, winning most of them.Winning the U.S. Tournament and fighting Shadaloo Main Article: Street Fighter Alpha  Ken did not participate in the first World Warrior tournament; instead, he fought in (and won) the premiere U.S. Martial Arts tournament that had been previously won by Charlie Nash, as well as meeting a very attractive girl named Eliza, who became his girlfriend. After winning the U.S. martial arts tournament, Ken returned to his training ground to tell his master Gouken the good news. There, he witnessed his master's death at the hands of Akuma. Enraged and grief-stricken, he attacked Akuma, only to be knocked to the ground by a single blow. Ken began wandering the world in search of Akuma, and his friend and fellow student Ryu; he wanted to tell Ryu what happened to their master, and also hoped to win a match against him. He eventually finds Ryu in seclusion. Ryu is dejected upon seeing his long-time friend, but Ken makes him go try out a spar anyway. After winning, Ken realizes how stressed out his best friend is since his fight with Sagat. Ryu explains to Ken that deep within him there is a burning rage - a power trying to overcome him. Giving Ryu his red headband, Ken tells him to stay focused, which greatly cheers Ryu up. Ken returns home and, with Eliza's support, begins training harder, knowing even with his recent feelings, that Ryu is always stronger than he looks. Ken begins to wonder about his own life. Ryu seemed to be on the right track again, but what of him? Along the road to proving himself again, he encounters Karin, who tells him she has followed his career and is trying to best her rival Sakura to prove she is superior. Ken advises her it's good to have a rival, not for supremacy, but to keep on training harder and focusing. With this, Ken finds himself again and is focused once more. Going off to meet up with Sakura, they have a friendly match, and Ken finally realizes that Ryu has the right idea all along. Both he and Sakura begin to travel to find Ryu, but their path crosses with that of Shadaloo dictator M. Bison. Ken confronts him but is easily defeated and placed under Bison's hypnosis. Bison then uses brainwashed Ken to lure Ryu out of hiding. Once Ryu shows up, Bison makes Ken fight him. Ryu wins and manages to release Ken of Bison's mind control. Ryu then proceeds to fight Bison but loses and, just like Ken before him, is turned into a slave of Bison's Psycho Power. Sagat appears and, enraged by Bison's actions, engages Ryu in an attempt to break Bison's mental grip on him. Ken, now free and aided by Sakura, attacks Bison. This intervention, along with Sagat's presence, makes Ryu come to his senses. Recovered, Ryu takes on Bison once more. Bison senses Ryu's dark power (which Bison describes as \"The ultimate form of Psycho Power\") and attempts to manipulate Ryu's mind once again. At his friends urging, Ryu resists and defeats Bison with a powerful Hadoken. Ken is happy to see his old friend again. With a promise of a new duel, the two part their ways.The Second World Warrior Tournament, marrying Eliza and becoming Violent Ken Main Article: Street Fighter II  Ken received an invitation to the second World Warrior tournament; however, since his last U.S. Martial Arts tournament, he had let himself spend too much time with his girlfriend, Eliza, rather than training. Only Ryu's personal challenge rekindled Ken's fighting spirit and persuaded him to enter the second World Warrior tournament. After the events of Street Fighter II, Ken is married to Eliza, something he had apparently vowed only to do after winning a decisive victory against Ryu. However it is unknown if the two fought during the tournament, or if Ken actually won if they even did. No details have been stated, although it is heavily implied that they indeed did fight, and Ken won. During the tournament, he became brainwashed by Bison and becomes Violent Ken.Fighting Seth and becoming a father Main Article: Super Street Fighter IV  When a new tournament is announced, Ken is unsure whether to compete, as Eliza is now far along in pregnancy and he doesn't want to leave her. Sensing his inner conflict, Eliza assures him that she'll be fine and that the baby isn't due for a while yet, so he should go meet up with Ryu and tell him she says hi. Ken enters, and in the absence of gas stations near the location for the final, he parks his SUV in a convenient spot, calls Eliza to check on her, and continues the rest of the way on foot. Over the course of the tournament, he encounters his self-appointed rival, Rufus, although the results of that match are unknown. It is later implied that Ken may have defeated M. Bison in the tournament. After the tournament, it is discovered that Gouken is still alive, and Ken and Ryu pursue him as he leaves. Ken is upset that Gouken has not said anything to them, but Gouken counters that they no longer need a master. Ken and Ryu head home on foot, and Rufus passes them by on his motorbike, calling them losers. Soon however, Rufus' bike runs out of gas, and Ken and Ryu reach the SUV; Ken offers Rufus and his girlfriend Candy a lift, but Rufus refuses. Upon arriving home afterwards, he tells Eliza that although he did indeed get to fight Ryu, they had been so busy with the rest of the unfolding events that they hadn't been able to give it their all. Soon afterwards, their son is born  and they name him Mel.Street Fighter V  As expected, Ken returned in Street Fighter V as of July 9, 2015. In the game, he has a different outfit and hairstyle, and his moves have been altered to further distance him from Ryu.Character story  Ken, Eliza and Mel are invited to a party hosted by Karin. During the party, Ken reflects on the various sparring matches between him and Ryu. The family gets lost on the way to the party and encounter Birdie, who thinks they\u2019re trespassing, resulting in a fight with Ken. Karin arrives and offers Ken a pre-meal fight as an apology for Birdie attacking him, which Ken accepts. Afterwards, he and Eliza wonder about why Ryu isn't at the party.A Shadow Falls  In the main story, Ken came to visit Ryu, who was in the middle of meditating. After beating him in a sparring match, Ryu tells him that he will join them when his training is complete. Later, Ken arrives with the rest of the fighters called by Karin to the Kanzuki Estate, where they plan their first infiltration of the Shadaloo base.  Ken, Chun-Li and Cammy travel to Brazil to search for the first missing chess piece, held by Laura Matsuda. While there, he saves Sean from F.A.N.G, but is then attacked by his older sister Laura, who mistakes him for an enemy. After the fight, Sean sorts out the misunderstanding by indicating the unconscious Shadaloo soldiers. Laura then decides to join them, but on the condition that Ken add Matsuda Jiu-Jitsu to his selection of online karate classes, which he agress to. Chun-Li then leaves to assist Karin in the group's first infiltration. Ken remains with Laura, and the duo fend off more Shadaloo soldiers, with Ken taking out three with a single Shinryuken.\u00a0 Ken reunites with Ryu just before the group begins the final assault against Shadaloo. After Bison's final defeat at Ryu's hands and Shadaloo's destruction, Ken finds Ryu alone and meditating, and decide to have another friendly sparring match to see if Ryu had found his 'true answer'. Ryu manages to defeat Ken, but drops his red headband; Ken hands it back to him, figuring he might still need it. The two are later seen sharing a friendly fist bump.Street Fighter III  Sometime before the series, Ken and his family move to southern California from Washington State. Ken then entered the third World Warrior tournament. By this time, a Brazilian teenager named Sean had been pestering him to become his student, and Ken reluctantly accepted, beginning to train him. He fought Sean in the tournament and won against him; however, he drops out upon realizing Ryu was defeated by Oro. Ken begins to train his son Mel in rudimentary fighting techniques. He also told Sean to go find Ryu and challenge him, giving him some free time with Eliza. Though bored, Ken hears about a mysterious organization and goes to investigate, and he may have confronted Urien. He learned that Ryu had sought him out and traveled all the way to New York from Oakland for their long-awaited rematch. Tossing some friendly jabs at each other, both have a good fight, ultimately won by Ryu. Since then, Ken has continued to train Sean and Mel, handle his family and business, and keep up with his old friend Ryu. In Sean's ending, Ken wakes up Sean who was beaten unconscious after being knocked down by his opponent in the first round. In Ken's ending, he wins his third straight U.S. Martial Arts tournament, which is a new record, and offers the trophy to Sean who turns the offer down, wanting to earn it for himself.Crossover appearances Marvel vs. Capcom series  Ken appears as a playable character in several games in the series: Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter, X-Men vs. Street Fighter and Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes.

Three versions of his Street Fighter II theme, including a new remix made for the game, is included in the Wii U version. In Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Ken made his playable debut; he is an \"Echo Fighter\" (a cosmetically unique character with different attack animations and voice clips but functionally similar in gameplay and attack data to another character) to Ryu. He was first leaked on September 21st, 2018, and later officially confirmed on November 1 the same year. As the original echo fighter within fighting game history, Ken is based primarily on his Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers (most further one is from Turbo) onwards, such as the multiple hit specials (excluding Hadoken) and \"crazy kicks\", with one of the latter\u2019s moves being his Focus Attack from Street Fighter IV, and the Roundhouse Kicks instead of Ryu\u2019s Shakunetsu Hadoken. His Final Smash changes depending on the distance to the nearest opponent, so if no one is directly in front of and close to Ken, he performs the a Marvel vs. Capcom-styled Shinryuken. If there is an enemy within melee range, he instead performs the Shippu Jinraikyaku, which has few spinning kick-based essences based on his Guren Senpukyaku and Guren Enjinkyaku from post-Street Fighter III games.Animations Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie  In this film, Ken Masters is Ryu's long time friend and sparring partner; a flashback reveals that Ken gave Ryu his ponytail wrapping to use as a headband after the latter had hit his head falling down some stairs.

Ken is captured, brainwashed, and sent to fight against Ryu, keeping them preoccupied while Bison tracks down Guile. When Ryu undoes the brainwashing, Bison uses his Psycho Power to cast Ken before turning his attention to Ryu, who defends himself against Bison, initially with little success. Fortunately, Ken uses his master's teachings to mend his body, and joins the fight. With their combined forces, Ryu and Ken eventually pummel Bison into submission, and seem to finish off the dictator for good with a combined Hadoken. After defeating Bison, Ken and Ryu part and go their separate ways, with Ryu starting his journey anew.Street Fighter (TV series)  Ken appears as a major character in the TV series, voiced by Scott McNeil. Unlike his main incarnation, Ken is shown to be greedy and adventurous, looking for all kinds of treasure, keeping up with his role as a con man in the live-action Street Fighter film; Guile even states that Ken views the duties and responsibilities of being on his team as simply meaning he has to \"party less\". In the series, Ken has red hair instead of his usual blond color. This version of Ken is also stated to be even stronger than Ryu, defeating Akuma during their battle.Street Fighter II V  In this series, Ken and Ryu are best friends who trained under the same master; he is the 17-year-old son of the extremely rich Masters family.

After returning to the United States for the first time since he left as a child to begin his training in Japan, he has been an unstoppable force in the American fighting circuit, although he never earned the opportunity to fight the reigning champion, Allen Snider. Much to Ken's delight, it turned out that he would get such an opportunity in the first round of the first EX tournament. The match turned out to be a bit of a let down for Ken, achieving an easy victory over Allen, who used a variant form of Ken's own fighting style. Astounded by the ferocity of Ken's attacks, Allen was overwhelmed and asked where Ken trained. Ken informed him of his life in Japan, and from that point on, Allen vowed to travel all over the world to become not only America's greatest fighter, but the world's as well. Ken advanced several rounds in the tournament until he got what he had wished for: a match with Ryu. When the match started, Ryu didn't seem overly thrilled to see Ken. In fact, Ken wasn't sure if Ryu knew who he was at all. As the match progressed, Ken realized that Ryu was not himself, and his technique had changed. Ken stopped fighting Ryu and refused to strike back, insisting that Ryu regain his senses. Struggling against Ryu, Ken held his ground and the sight of Ken struggling caused Ryu to snap back to his former self. When Ryu returned to normal, the sound of laughter could be heard. They both turned to face the man that had cause Ryu to lose his mind, M. Bison. Together, they launched an attack on him that sent M. Bison reeling. Right about that time, Guile and Chun-Li burst through the door together, but Bison hit a switch that allowed him to escape capture. Ryu thanked Ken for his efforts and said that he needed to travel more to better understand himself and the Satsui no Hadou inside him. Ken understood. They had a friendly rematch in the second tournament, and entered the third tournament as partners.Endings Street Fighter EX  \"See, I knew I was strong! If you truly want to beat me, then you might as well bring a tank with you next time. I better get lost now or Eliza will be mad at me. Ryu, next time we'll meet things will be different\"Street Fighter EX Plus \u03b1  \"I won, just like usual!\" Polishing his unique skills, Ken is a man whose fighting spirit burns for a match with his eternal rival Ryu. Will Ken be the victor this time? Or else...? The battle of this fighting genius continues.Street Fighter EX2  His beloved wife Eliza told him a story about none other than his brother-in-law Guile.\n\"Guile's one tough fellow, even if our fighting styles are different. He would definitely make a worthy sparring partner. Alright Eliza, make arrangements for my trip!\"\nKen, a man who was raised as a carefree martial artist. It's only a matter of time before this soaring dragon reaches the skies before us.Street Fighter EX2 Plus  \"The winner, Ken Masters!\"\nThe hall was overflown with the voice of great joy. Ken befriended his opponent and smiled.\n\"You were a good sport! But that's no reason to laugh at him.\"Street Fighter EX3  Ken sits inside a rainbow by a waterfall and reflects up his past, \"Nothing has changed at all since then...\" As he thinks about the days when he trained with his friend, he can't remeber all of the defeat, but he can clearly see each and every victory. He thinks, \"Yes. We must challenge again. I'll find ypu again. my friend... And this time, there will be only one winner!\"Street Fighter EX3 (in team with Ryu)  Ken laid his hand on Ryu's shoulder and says, \"Do you remember the days we fought against our master together?\" In a rare mood Ryu jockingly replies, \"...I could be more confident about our win than before.\" Surpirsed Ken remarks, \"Humph! Don't forget that I see you not as the most reliable partner but as the toughest rival. Keep that in mind, buddy.\"Gameplay Fighting style  Ken Masters, like Ryu, is a student of the unnamed Ansatsuken art referred to as Shotokan, though this only applies to his normal attacks with slight traces of Hapkido (as stated in the in-depth Japanese sources for his normal attacks' names). In the original Street Fighter and the first iteration of Street Fighter II, Ken was a clone of Ryu, with only one attack (a throw) appearing to be aesthetically different. In later Street Fighter II editions, Ken's character was modified to focus on style and attack speed, along with a notable focus on more brutal judo throws (such as his trademark knee striking grapple) and with some aspects of Kyokushin Karate. As a foil to Ryu, Ken's trademark technique is instead his Shoryuken.Moveset  Ken's entire moveset would continue to develop around the Shoryuken and multi-hit combos as the series progressed. His overall style of gameplay revolves around a rushdown strategy that executes powerful combos off of quick hit-confirms while maintaining mobility; Ken's moves generally come out fast, and can be used fluidly to create several such combos. However, this requires him to stay dangerously close to his opponents; in addition to having limited ranged tools, many of his moves can also leave him open for an easy counter if properly defended. This also ties into a weakness he shares with Ryu, which tends to be his mediocre physical range that causes him to rely more on zoning with his Hadoken as opposed to playing footsies in the neutral game; though unlike Ryu, most of Ken's moves are geared towards multi-hits as aforementioned, which on top of his mixups make him much more geared towards safe pressure and being able to get in. Ken's playstyle makes him quite easy to pick up and learn, to the point that he is one of the most used characters in the Street Fighter III and IV series. At one point, this resulted in the emergence of \"Flowchart Ken\" - a strategy for beginner and intermediate Ken players that was literally outlined in a flowchart style. Said strategy would go on to dominate a large portion of high-level play in Street Fighter IV. One of Ken's winning quotes even makes a jabbing reference to this in Super Street Fighter IV. In Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix Ken retains most of his moves, his Tatsumaki Sempukyaku are embedded with fire and enables him to shoot a Shakunetsu Hadoken. His Shoryureppa enables him to hit three times and his Shinryuken is much like his appearance in the Alpha games but Ken can be seen being burned up during the execution and his Shippu Jinraikyaku as well as all of his Super Combos serves as his Mighty Combos. He carries a large broken mallet consist of 100 tons to flatten his opponent to deal damage and has three disguises serving as his special attacks (Eg. a soccer player, a cowboy outfit while using a horse to knock his opponents and his casual outfit). During his Shippu Jinraikyaku Mighty Combo, Ken can sometimes be seen wearing his casual outfit during the execution of his kicks. Street Fighter V promised to put a new spin on Ken's playstyle, featuring a more \"in-your-face\" approach, much more akin to a rushdown character. Of particular note are the changes made to his Tatsumaki Senpukyaku (all three versions will now cause a knockdown and his hard kick variation now travels in an arc as opposed to horizontally across the arena). His EX Tatsumaki attacks are also revamped (his ground version traveling upwards diagonally and his airborne variation shooting down diagonally). His V-Skill, Quick Step, enables faster advancing movement against a foe and his V-Trigger, Heat Rush, imbues all of his special moves with fire and giving them enhanced properties (such as guaranteed knockdown when a Hadoken connects). His Shinryuken Super Combo returns as his second V-Trigger. Compared to Ryu, Ken is often seen as a more flashier foil, often coming up with several new deviating moves on the spot as opposed to sticking to the fundamentals as often as Ryu does. His creative mind allows his fighting style to always stay fresh for new arts on the fly at any given time.Techniques  As mentioned before, Ken uses the same moves as Ryu: he possesses a slightly weaker Hadoken, a more horizontal Shoryuken that can hit up to three times and set opponents ablaze, and a Tatsumaki Senpukyaku that can land up to five hits without knockdown. He also gained a series of command normal kicks; in the Street Fighter Alpha series only, these would be incorporated into his standard movelist with his other special attacks.Super/Ultra Combos  Ken's Super Combo in Super Street Fighter II Turbo is the Shoryureppa, a string of consecutive Shoryukens. In the Street Fighter Alpha series, he would gain another Shoryuken-based Super Combo in the Shinryuken, a vertical spinning Shoryuken with a 'vortex' effect that can be used (sometimes exclusively) in midair. The Street Fighter III series would reuse those moves as Super Arts; Ken also gains the Shippu Jinraikyaku, a powerful series of kicks followed by a rising Tatsumaki. The move would later appear as a Level 3 Super Combo in Street Fighter Alpha 3. In the Street Fighter EX series, Ken gains a Meteor Combo known as the Kuzuryu Reppa, which effectively combines the three aforementioned Super Combos; it leads with Shippu Jinraikyaku's kicks and instead of a Tatsumaki, Ken follows with three Shoryukens (the same as his Level 3 Shoryureppa in the Alpha series) and finishes with a Shinryuken. Kuzuryu Reppa would be seen again in SVC Chaos: SNK vs. Capcom, also appearing as one of Violent Ken's Super Combos. In the Street Fighter IV series, Ken uses the Shoryureppa as his Super Combo; his first Ultra Combo is the Shinryuken, and his 2nd Ultra is a new move known as the Guren Senpukyaku, a flaming horizontal Tatsumaki that adds a final finisher kick at the end \"for good measure\". In Street Fighter V, Ken uses a powerful version of Guren Senpukyaku known as Guren Enjinkyaku as his Critical Art (where he launches himself at his opponent with a fierce kick that sends them airborne then follows them up with a flaming Tatsumaki to the face before kicking them away). The Shoryureppa returns as well, acting as his EX Shoryuken.Violent Ken  Violent Ken is an alternate version of Ken that mades his debut in SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos. He is the result of Ken being brainwashed and controlled by M. Bison's Psycho Power. He returned in Ultra Street Fighter II: The Final Challengers as a new character alongside Evil Ryu. He is faster then Ken and has two new moves; a teleport, dash move, the Rasetsu Kyaku, and his super combo, the Shinbu Messatsu, where Violent Ken does a series of punches and kicks and ends with a fiery Shoryuken. In SVC Chaos, he automatically teleports, making it more similar to the Raging Demon. But in The Final Challengers, he simply does the move, however it is possible to do the Shinbu Messatsu out of a Rasetu Kyaku immediately.Actors  While his original voice was a re-use of the Ryu audio samples, beginning with Super Street Fighter II Ken's voice was performed by Kenji Haga, who also did his voice in the Street Fighter II anime movie. Tetsuya Iwanaga did Ken's voice in the Street Fighter Alpha series, and Koji Tobe did Ken's voice in the Street Fighter III games. In SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos, he was voiced by Atsushi \"Monster\" Maezuka, who voiced a number of SNK characters. He was voiced by Scott McNeil in the Street Fighter animated series. He was voiced by Kazuya Ichijo in Japanese and Steven Blum in the dub for the Street Fighter Alpha movie. In Street Fighter II V, he was voiced by Jimmy Theodore and in Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie, he was voiced by Eddie Frierson. In Street Fighter IV, he is voiced by Reuben Langdon in the English version, who also voices Dante from the Devil May Cry series. Langdon also voices Ken in Disney's 2012 film, Wreck-It Ralph. Damian Chapa portrayed Ken in the 1994 Street Fighter movie, where he is a con artist alongside Ryu. After the two unsuccessfully try to scam Shadaloo Tong leader, Sagat, they are arrested by Allied Nations forces. Guile offers them their freedom in exchange for infiltrating Bison's base (to whom Sagat runs guns) and revealing its location so that the AN can make a military strike and free the hostages captured earlier in the film. Ken and Ryu are forced to betray the vengeful GNT news-crew (Chun Li, Balrog and Honda) in order to gain Bison's trust, but later try to free them and are captured. When Guile eventually infiltrates Bison's base and chaos ensues Ryu and Ken try to help free the hostages but split up when the AN forces arrive (according to Ken the soldiers get paid and that they should not risk their lives). Ken later comes to Ryu's aid when he is ambushed by Vega and Sagat. While Ryu defeats Vega, Ken defeats Sagat and drops a heavy golden statue on his hands before delivering a parting line: \"If I hadn't met you, I might have become you.\". Interestingly, Ken and Sagat are portrayed as rivals, switching the usual scenario from the games, with Ryu's rivalry switched to Vega. Christian Howard played Ken in Street Fighter: Legacy, which was co-directed by Joey Ansah and Owen Trevor. Howard reprised his role as Ken in Street Fighter: Assassin's Fist, Street Fighter: Resurrection and Street Fighter: World Warrior.Trivia See also References Cammy  Cammy White (\u30ad\u30e3\u30df\u30a3\u30fb\u30db\u30ef\u30a4\u30c8, Kyam\u012b Howaito), also known by the codename Killer Bee (\u30ad\u30e9\u30fc\u30d3\u30fc, Kir\u0101 B\u012b), is a video game character from the Street Fighter series, first appearing in Super Street Fighter II. The second female fighter in the series, she was once a deadly clone assassin working for Shadaloo before breaking free and becoming an MI6 operative for the British government.Biography Appearance  Cammy has blue eyes and blonde hair, tightly slicked back, with long braided pigtails, large forelock, and a scar on her left cheek. She has a muscular body and wears her signature outfit, a sleeveless green thong leotard. During her time under Shadaloo she wore a blue thong leotard with a blue garrison cap, decorated with blue camouflage paint. The leotard also had an opening in the upper back portion to reveal her upper back, just below her shoulder blades. In Super Street Fighter II and Super Street Fighter II Turbo, Cammy wore her green thong leotard that consisted of a Delta Red triangle insignia on either the right or left breast (some promo art has it on the right while other instances, including her endings in SSFII, have it on the left), a red beret, red socks and black calf-high combat boots, and red gauntlets. Her legs were sparsely decorated with green camouflage paint. This classic incarnation is known as \"Delta Red Cammy.\" One of the earlier drafts of Cammy's character design has her wearing harnesses and a gun holster, details which were eventually incorporated into her Street Fighter V default design. In Cannon Spike, Cammy is wearing an outfit similar to her SSFII incarnation, except she has kneepads and inline skates, as well as two sub-machine guns. In her right hand, she holds a standard Uzi sub-machine gun, and in her left, a Skorpion vz. 61. Both guns are depicted as comically larger in size compared their real counterparts. In X-Men vs. Street Fighter, Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold, and every subsequent game in which she appeared in her \"Killer Bee\" or \"Shadaloo\" persona, Cammy wore her light blue thong leotard and a small yellow tie attached to the front of her turtleneck, a small blue garrison cap, knee-high brown boots, and red gauntlets similar to her classic incarnation. Her legs were lightly adorned with a blue lightning bolt design. This uniform is a lighter version of the Shadaloo Doll uniform, and swaps the standard tights for the bare legged, lightning bolt design. The lightning bolts could be symbolic of speed; they are often attributed to real world military forces, known for conducting raids. This was probably adoptive of lightning bolt symbols that were used in the Roman empire. Shadaloo Cammy's pre-fight intro has her wearing an over sized red cloak (the same seen in Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie), which she quickly discards, revealing her previously hidden identity. In the anime series Street Fighter II V, Cammy's hair is styled in a high ponytail instead of the braids (though she is seen in her original pigtails in a photograph in episode 17). She wears a black leather tank top, matching black leather tights, and a choker decorated with a crucifix, the latter which she used to conceal a deadly garotte to assassinate her victims. In the series, she usually works as a contract assassin. In Final Fight: Streetwise, her attire reflects the game's urban aesthetics while retaining her trademark pigtails and red cap. In this game she sports a sleeveless sweater top, silver and red gauntlets, and baggy fatigued cargo pants that sag slightly. In Street Fighter IV, Cammy appears in her classic Delta Red attire. Her alternate attire, available as DLC, resembles her Killer Bee attire with key differences. The top is a padded, collared, tight fitting 'winter' jacket with fur trim, and a Delta Red symbol on the chest. Cammy has a matching hat and tall knee lace-up boots as well, and retains her signature gauntlets; a variation of this outfit appears as her \"nostalgia\" costume in Street Fighter V. She appears to be wearing her thong leotard under the jacket while her legs are still painted with fatigue strips. Her third Super Street Fighter IV alternate costume resemble M. Bison's attire, and her new alternate costume resembles DC Comics character Catwoman's suit with military touches. In the SSFIV OVA, she wears her Delta Gear, though her gauntlets are dark blue instead of red. Her Swap Attire in Street Fighter X Tekken is based on Tekken character, King, which also alludes to her fondness for cats. Adding pro wrestling gear inspired by King, the most distinct feature is a jaguar hood with cat ears - similar to her own catsuit in SSFIV. She also has jaguar fur on her lower body. Her alternate attire is inspired by her apparent interest in punk rock music; this is probably attributed to her being British; punk originally having stemmed from those islands. She wears a leather skirt, leather vest with a pink midriff top underneath, black gauntlets and armbands, and knee-high black boots with red socks. Cammy's appearance in Street Fighter V is mostly unaltered from her appearance in the Street Fighter IV series. She loses the camouflage markings on her legs, but gains a shoulder and thigh gun holster each and she has a significant larger bust. Her fighting stance has also changed, resembling that of Evil Ryu's in SNK vs. Capcom: Match of the Millennium. She has seven alternate costumes in Street Fighter V. Her first outfit is a green military coat, a white long sleeve button shirt with a yellow tie, black panties underneath her coat and black knee-high military boots. She retains her classic red beret and delta red gloves. The second is a blue long sleeve thong leotard with white thigh-high socks, black knee pads, and a matching pair of black boots. She gains a black nylon utility belt on her waist, a matching pair of black mid-arm gloves, and a green backpack. She also has brown camouflage markings on her legs and face. Her long blonde hair is loose, with red rider goggles on her forehead. The third costume is a Halloween costume, with Cammy dressed as a zombie bride, complete with a tattered wedding dress and veil, along with roses with thorns across her waist and right arm, as well as a tiara atop her head. The fourth costume is a school-themed costume, with Cammy dressed as an English boarding school student, donning a school jacket with vest and button-up shirt and tie underneath the vest, dark grey stockings and Mary Jane shoes. Her long blond hair is tied back into a ponytail with this school costume.Incarnation history  In Super Street Fighter II, and Super Street Fighter II Turbo, Cammy was a member of a British special forces team known as Delta Red. This classic incarnation is known as \"Delta Red Cammy.\" In the later games X-Men vs. Street Fighter and Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold (Cammy is a secret character in the latter), Cammy appears as her younger version featured in the prequel storyline of Street Fighter Alpha, detailing the time when she was affiliated with Shadaloo. Therefore, this version of Cammy is known as \"Shadaloo Cammy\", or \"Doll Cammy\". She is also referred to by her codename, \"Killer Bee.\" Since Shadaloo Cammy didn't have a storyline in Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold (until the re-release version of the arcade port in Street Fighter Alpha Anthology for the PS2; in SFA2 Gold she was only playable in the VS. and Training modes), and X-Men vs. Street Fighter is not considered a true part of the Street Fighter storyline, the Killer Bee's only canonical appearance is Street Fighter Alpha 3. Shadaloo Cammy also appeared as a playable character in Marvel vs. Capcom 2, Capcom vs. SNK, and Capcom vs. SNK 2, and made appearances in the endings of certain Street Fighter III 3rd Strike characters. Since the Shadaloo Cammy sprite was designed more recently than the Delta Red Cammy sprite, the former was larger and more detailed, therefore making it an obvious choice to use in other games; the sprite was also recycled in a similar fashion for use in the non-canon Capcom vs. SNK series. The most blatantly anachronistic appearance is in the 3rd Strike endings, where there was no reason to portray Shadaloo Cammy in a time far beyond Street Fighter Alpha 3, because in this appearance she is rendered in a drawing, rather than a re-used sprite. It seems it was done purely as a joke. In the futuristic 3D shooter Cannon Spike, Cammy is depicted as Delta Red for player 1, and Shadaloo for player 2. Therefore, although the \"Delta Red Cammy\" appeared first, \"Shadaloo Cammy\" predates the Delta Red version in the Street Fighter canon (besides having more in-game appearances).Personality  Cammy is a strong, forceful, determined, and pertinacious young woman with a firm sense of justice, who is extremely polite, friendly, respectful, and enthusiastic towards those whom she knows and cares about including Delta Red, Chun-Li or Guile, but can be very brutal and sometimes condescending to those whom she dislikes such as M. Bison or Vega. She refuses to go down without a fight, using her extensive training from both Delta Red and Shadaloo to her advantage in defeating her enemies. Though she does not believe in doing any more harm than necessary to her opponents, she employs some rather deadly techniques when they are needed. Overall, Cammy is not really fiery, impatient or obstreperous, she is just contemptuous, dismissive, and irritable. She is also rather relentless and harsh on herself when she makes mistakes. She could be a girl that's torn between childhood and adulthood, struggling with the resultant stresses. Cammy is also fond of cats, especially street cats. She can also be rude, obnoxious, argumentative, and irritating towards comic relief characters. Cammy doesn't believe people with loved ones should fight, after seeing seeing Ken with his son Mel but Chun-Li, remembering her own father, stated it was the reason he was fighting. Cammy claimed families \"confuse her\"\u00a0and upon seeing Laura and Sean mess with each other, she asked whether that was a normal sibling relationship.\u00a0\u00a0 Due to her connection with the Dolls she is unwilling to hurt them (especially Decapre) and can break ties with her friends in order to protect Bison's assassins, as Cammy attacked police officers and abandoned Chun-Li by fleeing with Juri and Decapre on a motorcycle when the latter were being detained by the authorities. Though Cammy quickly returned to Kanzuki estate (homebase) when Decapre was brought back to her senses. Cammy also has a strong sense of military discipline and stern honor, to the point where even the more powerful fighters in the series ask her to \"ease up\" when they meet her, as she is a very driven person. It's because of this warfare mindset that she respects soldiers like Guile and Charlie so much. Her hatred for Bison drives her though much of her appearances, but at the end of Street Fighter V Cammy mellows out and no longer pursues vengeance against Shadaloo and mainly focuses on the survival of her \"sisters\", the Dolls.Character Relationships Allies Chun-Li  Cammy and Chun-Li are close friends and stay in contact with each other. They mention each others' names frequently and usually team up with Guile when it comes to fighting Shadaloo. Chun-Li is also the one whom Cammy consults about \"normal\" life, such as when she asks Chun-Li about whether the bond between Laura and Sean can be considered a typical sibling relationship and asking why Ken was fighting for his family instead of staying behind and protecting them. \ufeffRyu  Cammy has a strong admiration for Ryu due to his great strength, fighting skills and heroic traits. They share a common enemy, M.Bison, against whom they have worked together several times. Cammy being knocked unconscious by C. Viper in Street Fighter IV: The Ties That Bind triggers Ryu's Satsui no Hado, resulting in Viper's retreat. Ryu's inspiring words of fighting is one of the few things that keeps Cammy going forward and never giving up.Guile  Cammy and Guile are friends and often team up together with Chun-Li for missions (mostly involving Shadaloo). Closer to the end of Street Fighter IV: The Ties That Bind, a bandaged Cammy is seen with Guile, implying that he was the one overseeing her recovery. \ufeffDhalsim  Dhalsim was the one who made her self-aware of her mind control by Shadaloo after she was sent to assassinate him in Street Fighter Alpha 3. They, along with others, teamed up to defeat Shadaloo in Street Fighter V.Karin  Karin and Cammy share a mutual respect for one another. Karin also recognizes Cammy as one of the top ranked fighters in the world. In Street Fighter V, Cammy is one of many fighters Karin has contacted to help stop Shadaloo's plan for global domination. While assembling the other fighters, Cammy shares the information she has gathered with Karin regarding the Black Moons, stating that they were created by Shadaloo using the hackers they had supposedly kidnapped. Cammy also points out that the control 'pieces' were also made by the hackers. She also mentions that Guile is keeping in touch with someone who infiltrated Shadaloo. Later on when the Kanzuki Estate was being infiltrated by Decapre and Marz, Cammy and Karin worked together to fight them off.Decapre  Decapre is an imperfect product of the Shadaloo cloning experiments that created Cammy. In Decapre's Ultra Street Fighter IV intro, Decapre tries to comfort Cammy and calls herself \"big sister\". Years later, Decapre, under a mental crisis and trying to break free from Bison's mind control, hates Cammy due to re-adjustment of her thoughts. When they fight in Ultra Street Fighter IV, she becomes incapacitated in the fight and has been outside of her stasis pod for too long so M. Bison tells Cammy that the only way to save her is to take her back into her stasis pod, in mind control. Cammy reluctantly accepts and Decapre is returned to full mind control. Later, she encounters Decapre in Street Fighter V when she attacks the Kanzuki estate and again in Brazil, where she becomes incapacitated again, but this time, Cammy runs with her and Juri. After a brief struggle during which Cammy knocks Decapre unconscious, Decapre eventually breaks free of M. Bison's mind control, even before the other Dolls.Juni  Cammy considers Juni as one of her \"sisters\". In\u00a0Super Street Fighter IV, Juni awakens from her coma, only to find a cat starring at her. Cammy removes the kitten off of her and asks Juni if she's feeling any pain or discomfort. She reassures Juni that she's here for her, since is still recovering from amnesia. Juni recognizes Cammy, who ensures that she is here to help her, as well as the kitten, ending with the two exchanging smiles. In Street Fighter V, Cammy and Juni are seen in Cammy's story mode, where Juni looks recovered and happy; Cammy would also defend Juni from Shadaloo, who sought to recapture her presumably for use in F.A.N.G's Operation C.H.A.I.N.S alongside the other Dolls. Juni is also seen to be working as a Delta Blue agent in the UDON comics.Juli  Juli is one of Cammy's \"sisters\" and was brainwashed by Shadaloo, which turned her to an assassin. Cammy managed to free her from M.Bison's mind control in 'A Shadow Falls'.Enemies M. Bison  Cammy was one of M. Bison's replacement bodies and her most hated foe. M. Bison is the leader of Shadaloo and is believed that when M. Bison dies, Cammy either dies too or her body becomes taken over by M. Bison, none of which has happened since his possible death in A Shadow Falls.Juri  \ufeffCammy and Juri consider themselves enemies, mostly because of what they have done to each other in the past. In the SSFIV Juri OVA, Juri brutalizes the dolls and Chun-Li, with her wanting to get revenge. In her Super Street Fighter IV rival cut scene with Juri, Cammy claims she came to get revenge for what Juri has done to the dolls, while Juri claims Cammy used her \"brainwashing\" to avoid responsibility of what she has done in the past with Shadaloo. However in Street Fighter V, after Cammy becomes a fugitive by assaulting police officers when they were trying to detain Decapre, Juri helps Cammy escape with Decapre on her motorcycle. She brings Cammy to Russia where Helen and others have been meeting, but then comes back to the Kanzuki Estate with Karin and the other fighters. While still cautious over Juri, she definitely acknowledged her help. It is assumed Juri no longer bothered her 'sisters' since the collapse of Shadaloo, with the dolls being free of the brainwashing.C. Viper  Cammy and C. Viper are only rivals; Cammy sees her as an enemy because she works for the S.I.N. but is unaware of the fact that C. Viper is a CIA agent secretly trying to take down S.I.N. and Shadaloo. After Cammy defeats Viper for standing in her way, Viper then appears in her Street Fighter IV ending, holding her at gunpoint trying to get the BLECE files, but Cammy deletes them, not wanting to hurt anyone, and then Viper flees disappointed that her mission failed. In Street Fighter IV: The Ties That Bind, Cammy is brutally tortured by Viper, and later reappears with Guile and Chun-Li, with a broken arm and a broken leg as well.\ufeffVega  Cammy hates Vega since he is a part of Shadaloo and is obsessive of her and her beauty (in one comic he is the one who scars her cheek). In Street Fighter Alpha 3, Cammy goes rogue, and Vega is sent by M. Bison to find her and to take her back to Shadaloo. When he finds her, he goes into a fight with her, calling her a \"guinea pig\", which confuses Cammy, unaware of the situation. Cammy wins and wonders what is going on and goes to M. Bison, who explains that she's a clone of him with his DNA. When she defeats him, he is killed and his original body disappears. When the Psycho Drive is blown up, she is near the explosion, but is saved by Vega; she doesn't know he saved her. He still shows interest in her in Street Fighter V, following her around during her character story. When Vega attacks her, Cammy fights back while protecting Juni. After defeating Vega, he falls back, but not before warning Cammy of the potential danger of the path she has chosen. In A Shadow Falls, Vega watches as Cammy rides away with Juri on her motorbike, while carrying an unconscious Decapre. He follows them, still intrigued and obsessed of Cammy and her beauty. After Cammy knocks out Decapre again at Union Station, Vega arrives and confronts her. Noticing the unconscious Doll, he chuckles and claims that Decapre still has a role to play, despite considering her to be an 'ugly' Doll. He attacks and defeats Cammy, while flattering over her beauty. During his fight against Juri, Cammy reawakens and quickly kicks Vega's mask off of his face, causing him to retreat. Upon seeing Cammy coming to Decapre's defense, he leaves. Later on after Cammy defeated Juli at the Shadaloo Base, Vega attacks Cammy once again. Just when he's about to finish her off, Cammy is saved by Decapre. When the Shadaloo base blows up, he throws his mask into the explosion, possibly deciding to abandon her.Story Street Fighter Alpha series  Cammy's actual birthplace and early history are unknown; her first appearance in the Street Fighter chronology was in\u00a0Street Fighter Alpha 2\u00a0Gold, where she was a soulless Doll who seemingly broke free of her brainwashing and traveled the world to find out the truth. Eventually, she faced M. Bison and she asked him what her purpose was in life, in which he tells Cammy that she was to serve him, he also realized that Cammy became much stronger during her journey. Cammy wins her battle against M. Bison, but is hit by a bolt of electric current and knocked down. Once again she is brainwashed to erase her memories of whatever discovery she made during her journey.\u00a0 In Street Fighter Alpha 3, Cammy was sent to assassinate Dhalsim. Dhalsim used his spiritual powers to make her self-aware, and she realized that Shadaloo was controlling her. M. Bison sent Vega to observe her. When Vega confronted her, he revealed to her that she was an \"experiment\" and was no longer needed. As revealed in his own storyline Vega started having doubts about killing Cammy, asking himself if he really only cared about worthy foes, and after a fight where he admitted having underestimated Cammy he allowed her to go. Vega also threatened Cammy by revealing that Shadaloo's hit squads were coming for her. Cammy wondered why Shadaloo wanted to destroy her, since she had never committed any altercations against them. She later encountered Juli and Juni, two other Shadaloo Dolls, who lacked the benefit of self-awareness. When Cammy confronted Bison, he told her that she was meant to become his next body, after his current physical manifestation was destroyed by his own Psycho Power. Cammy managed to break the twelve Dolls free from Shadaloo's mind control, and they confronted Bison together. He explained to Cammy that she was a clone of himself who possessed a small portion of his Psycho Power, and that if he were to die, she would die as well. Cammy fought against his psychic probing and rescued the Dolls from Bison's control with the Psycho Drive. Cammy got the Dolls out of the Shadaloo base and then fell unconscious, no longer a clone, but an independent human. Vega rescued her before the base was destroyed, not wanting to allow a beautiful human to die. He deposited her on the doorstep of the British paramilitary government organization Delta Red.Super Street Fighter II  Cammy awoke with amnesia, and Delta Red took her in. While she could not remember her past, she retained nearly all the fighting capabilities that were implanted in her during her tenure with Shadaloo. This made her a very valuable asset to the team. The second World Warrior tournament was announced and, discovering that Bison was part of it, Cammy felt a strange connection to him, and entered the tournament. She confronted Bison, who told her that she is a copy of him, that she killed for him, that he planted her in Delta Red (but didn't count on her losing her memories), and that he had no further use for her. She later joined in the battle against Bison along her allies when the tournament ended. After Bison was defeated, her Delta Red teammates told her that she didn't need to live in the past; she had a new life to live. The Delta Red team consists of the leader, Colonel Keith Wolfman, ranged weapons expert Matthew McCoy, melee weapons expert Lita Luwanda, and young computer expert George Ginzu.Street Fighter IV series Super Street Fighter IV: OVA  Some time later, Cammy, Guile and Chun-Li continue to investigate S.I.N. when they run afoul of Juri, one of S.I.N.'s operatives. Juri hospitalizes Chun-Li but runs when Guile and Cammy arrive. Soon after, the three start to receive anonymous tips (unbeknownst to them, the tips are from Viper) which gives them info about Juri. They use the info they obtain to catch up to Juri as she assaults a secret facility which houses the twelve Dolls for Shadaloo. By the time Guile and Cammy arrive, Juri has already defeated all twelve Dolls and is carrying the final two, Juni and Juli, unconscious, to her jet. A fight ensues and Guile is incapacitated, and as Cammy rushes to his aid, Juri escapes with the Dolls to her jet. Cammy catches up just as it takes off, and after a brief skirmish, Juri pushes a gurney carrying Juni into Cammy and off the plane. However, the two fall into a deep snow drift and survive.Super/Ultra Street Fighter IV  Juni falls into a coma, and Colonel Wolfman informs her that S.I.N. has recently built a dam in India, cutting off the water supply to a nearby village where Dhalsim lives. Surveillance photos reveal S.I.N. operatives in the area bearing Shadaloo's insignia. Dispatched to investigate, Cammy then enters the recently announced S.I.N tournament, where she swears to get revenge on Juri for the dolls who she considers her \"sisters.\" She does encounter Juri again, although the winner of the rematch remains unknown. Later during the tournament she infiltrates the S.I.N dam base. When she does, she discovers computer files on a \"BLECE Project\" in the process. While reading the files, Crimson Viper surprises her and holds her at gunpoint, wanting the BLECE files for herself. Not wanting the data to be used to hurt anyone, Cammy deletes the files instead, and Viper puts away her weapon and escapes, lamenting years of investigation wasted. During her infiltration of the base she encounters Decapre, who collapses while raving about how she hates Cammy and her face. Bison appears and informs Cammy that Decapre is dying, but that a bargain could be made. Cammy allows Bison to take Decapre in exchange for saving her life. When Cammy informs Colonel Wolfman of her failure to retrieve the files, Wolfman informs her that he's already aware, and congratulates her on a job well done. Cammy returns home and soon Juni wakes from her coma with some amnesia. Cammy greets her comfortably and promises to help Juni recover.Street Fighter V  Cammy appears as a playable character in Street Fighter V. She was confirmed, along with Birdie, on June 15 at the E3 2015.Character Story  Cammy remembers her encounter with Decapre, who angrily attacked\u00a0her due to her strong hatred. Then, she also remembers that she had hurt everyone in the past and now wants to protect. She is later contacted by her superior, informing her that Shadaloo is on the move. As she travels through India, she encounters Birdie. After defeating him, he recognizes Cammy as one of Bison's dolls from the time that he was a Shadaloo member as the police arrive. Birdie escapes, which Cammy fails to. Arriving at the Shadaloo base, she is attacked by F.A.N.G, who seeks to terminate her due to defecting from Shadaloo. During their battle, Cammy asks him about Decapre's whereabouts, then soon changes her question to be about all of Bison's dolls. F.A.N.G mocks Cammy over her desire to protect the dolls, and then alludes to Cammy's history as a killer. Before she can press further however, she is swarmed by Shadaloo soldiers as F.A.N.G mentions \"Operation C.H.A.I.N.S.\" and warns her that if she interferes, he will kill her with no mercy, causing Cammy to flee. When Cammy returns to London, she is reunited with Juni, noticing she has a permission to go out. As the two are talking about cats, they are cornered by Shadaloo. Vega attacks her, when Juni begins to recognizes the claw that Vega wields is much like Decapre's, and Cammy is forced to fight Vega while protecting Juni. After defeating Vega, he falls back, noticing Cammy's dangerous actions. Juni worries for Cammy as she remembers how F.A.N.G told her about the operation. Cammy decides to stop Shadaloo and to save her fellow dolls. Juni encourages her and tells her to come back after she saves them. As Cammy leaves the scene, Juri is revealed to have been observing the whole event while spying on her.A Shadow Falls  In the main's story, Cammy manages to save Chun-Li when Bison is about to unleash his final blow towards her which makes her, Guile and Chun-Li to retreat. That night, the three reconvene at another devastated part of the city, with some cars on fire. She informs Guile that she has been after Shadaloo ever since the Black Moons appeared, also confirming that they are involved in New York's destruction. Cammy briefly chastises Chun-Li, who's still injured, for completely losing her head in the earlier fight. According to her information, the control keys for the Black Moons were stolen from Shadaloo so they can't activate all of them. Cammy wonders if the control keys were stolen by someone who betrayed Bison, or if a spy infiltrated Shadaloo. Guile and Chun-Li mention it might be connected to the earlier-referenced hackers incident, involving hackers of varying ages, genders, and nationalities all going missing around the same time, which they'd been investigating for a long time even before the moons appeared. Cammy questions if the missing hackers were coerced to build the Black Moons for Shadaloo. As Chun-Li recovers, Cammy then pulls out a package another Interpol agent had tried to send to Chun-Li, before attacked by Shadaloo. Taking the package, Chun-Li opens it, and Guile recognizes it as being \"the same\" as one that he has in his pocket. Just then, they notice the mutilated-and-stitched-together form of Charlie Nash walking ominously towards them. Rashid and his butler Azam cheerfully emerge from the other side. As Guile confronts Charlie, Rashid steps forward and introduces himself, engaging Chun-Li with intent to take the piece. Cammy tries to help, but Azam intervenes. After Rashid defeats Chun-Li's and takes her piece, he and Azam leave via mini-tornado. Cammy shields her face as the two escape. Later, Cammy arrives at the Kanzuki Estate. According to Karin's resources, she and Shibasaki were able to acquire a master list of the people that pieces were sent to, as well as who else may have access to that list. Cammy shares the information she's gathered as well, stating that the Black Moons were created by Shadaloo using by the hackers they supposedly kidnapped. She believes that the pieces were made by the hackers. Cammy reports that Guile is been in contact with a spy who infiltrated Shadaloo in hopes of acquiring more information. Cammy and Karin are soon confronted by Marz and Decapre along with Shadaloo soldiers. As Karin subdues Marz, Cammy defeats Decapre. As she tries to help her 'sister', Decapre's head begins to hurt. She escapes, leaving Cammy feeling guilty. As everyone are gathered to get the missing chess pieces, Cammy aids Chun-Li and Ken to go to Brazil. Before departing, she and Chun-Li watches as Ken plays with his son, Mel. Cammy thinks that Ken shouldn't have to come along with them, stating that he should stay and protect his family. Chun-Li argues that there are some battles aren't he can't avoid, especially when he has someone to protect; just like her father. Cammy apologizes to Chun-Li for reminding her of her father's passing. However, the concept of 'family' confuses her, since she does not have one. Karin soon arrives and informs Cammy and Chun-Li that the others have left. At Brazil, Cammy arrives with Chun-Li after Ken rescues Sean Matsuda from F.A.N.G. Ken tells Sean that they are looking for one of the pieces and asks Sean if they can have it, which he agrees. But as he retrieves the piece, Cammy spots a Shadaloo guard's body flying toward Sean. Ken and Chun-Li kick the guard's body out of harm's way, just as Laura arrives. Cammy watches interestingly at the Matsuda siblings as Laura greets her brother with submission holds Cammy asks Chun-Li whether the bond between the Matsuda siblings is considered to be a typical relationship between siblings. After Laura fights Ken and decides to join the others in the fight, they are confronted by Decapre who is under control of its Psycho Power. Cammy gazes to see Decapre has been controlled. She recalls the pain the Doll has suffered. Before Laura can volunteer to take on Decapre, Cammy steps in to fight her to be certain if she is an enemy or not. Cammy manages to defeat Decapre who finally lost consciousness. Unfortunately, Sean returns with the police, who have arrive to arrest Decapre. Cammy gazes at Decapre which reveals a flashback between her and Decapre to be separated when they are little as she heard Decapre's voice who calls her as her sister. When the police orders Cammy to give them Decapre, her protective nature of the Dolls kicks in, causing her Cammy to knock down a police officer. One of the officers fires his gun at Cammy for retaliation, but Cammy quickly carries Decapre out of harms way. Determined to save her, Cammy fights and defeats the officer. Before another officer can shoot her, Juri arrives to knock the policemen with her motorbike. She offers Cammy a ride, stating that she can repay her with Decapre. Juri removes Decapre's mask, exposing her burned face to everyone. Juri laughs at how Cammy's nature to the Dolls have turned her and Decapre to fugitives. Cammy eventually decides to go along with Juri. She carries Decapre and hops on the motorbike. As they rode away from Chun-li and the others, Vega watches with amusement and follows them, still obsessed with Cammy's beauty. At Union Station, Juri crashes her motorbike through the windows, relieved that they have lost the police. Cammy noticed Decapre is awakened. However, she attacks her on purpose because of her extreme hatred towards her causing both of them to have a catfight. As Decapre tries to choke Cammy, Juri watches on, amused that Cammy has given up everything to save her, despite the fact that she's trying to kill her. Cammy demands Decapre to stop attacking as she mounts on top of her. Decapre continues to fight and begins punching Cammy in the face. Juri believes that Decapre will never be cured and that Cammy should just kill her instead. Just when Decapre is about to hit her with her infused daggers, Cammy is catches the attack and knocks her out with a hard punch to the face. Juri laughs, impressed for her actions as Cammy gazes at Decapre with remorse. Suddenly, Vega arrives and confronts Cammy, who gets up from Decapre so she can fight him. Vega notices the unconscious Doll and chuckles, much to the chagrin of Cammy. Vega claims that Decapre may be an 'ugly' Doll, but she still has a role to play. He then attacks her. As Cammy defends herself, Vega is impressed at how Cammy's beauty is brought out with conflicts of her past memories, believing that such things were lost. Vega fights Cammy, wanting to see this new beauty of hers. After defeating Cammy, he flatters over her. But Vega's obsession of Cammy is interrupted by Juri., who calls him a pervert. Juri claims that Cammy belongs to her, since she picked her up first. Vega accuses Juri of lacking delicacy, which Juri expresses no concern. The two fight each other as Cammy wakes up. Seeing Vega is standing close to Decapre, Cammy quickly kicks Vega's mask off of his face, causing him to retreat. Upon seeing Cammy coming to Decapre's defense, he leaves. Cammy briefly stays in Helen's side because of Decapre's sake. She overhears a voice message from Li-Fen, stating that she has a way to a command to stop the Black Moons. When Charlie admits that he is unable to defeat Bison, Helen becomes upset, desperately demanding that he must kill him. Helen reminds Charlie that he doesn't have much time left, which he acknowledges before leaving. Later on, Cammy arrives in the final assault against Shadaloo. To her horrible shock, she finds all of the Dolls are controlled by F.A.N.G. Cammy confronts Juli, who has become infused with Psycho Power. She fights and eventually defeats Juli. As she approaches her unconscious body, Vega appears and attacks Cammy again. She was later attacked again by Vega which he was still obsessed from her beauty. Cammy drops in her stance as Vega compliments on her eyes and that he'll fill them with despair. Vega fights and once again defeats Cammy, managing to hit her stomach with his claw. As he demands to see more of her beauty, he goes in for the kill. But before he could finish her, Cammy is saved by Decapre, who blocks Vega's claw. He is impressed how she is finally free from control. Suddenly, Juri arrives, almost crashing her motorbike into the group. As the vehicle explodes, Juri challenges Vega since everyone is having a lot of fun. Cammy glances at Decapre, wondering why she has saved her. Juri claims that Decapre wants to help her, feeling a bit of jealousy. Vega attacks Juri and the two of them fight. Meanwhile, Cammy and Decapre are surrounded by the other Dolls. They prepare to fight their 'sisters' who are still controlled by F.A.N.G. When confronted by Rashid, the device that controls the Dolls is destroyed during their fight. After Cammy and Decapre defeat the other Dolls, Cammy notices that the Psycho Power surrounding them has disappeared. As the Dolls awaken, Shadaloo guards charge toward Cammy. However, because they have broke free from its control, the Dolls assist Cammy and Decapre, reuniting with their 'sisters' once again. Cammy is last seen with Juri and the other Dolls watching Shadaloo's destruction.Other appearances Marvel vs. Capcom games  Cammy is one of the playable characters in the first game of the Marvel vs. Capcom series, X-Men vs. Street Fighter.

Guile's Allied Nations strike force to take down Shadaloo. Cammy's rank is Sergeant. Australian singer and actress Kylie Minogue played Cammy, and reprises her role in the movie based games.Animations Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie  Cammy appears in Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie in a scene early in the movie, where she assassinates the British Minister of Justice, Albert Sellers, after being brainwashed by Shadaloo. She is then subdued by bodyguards and taken in for questioning by Interpol. She is later shown on a Shadaloo surveillance video being interrogated by Chun-Li, but by now, her brainwashing has worn off and she does not remember anything about the assassination. Bison later sends Sagat to kill both Cammy and Vega, but Cammy's fate is left unrevealed. For whatever reason, like all the characters portrayed in the anime, Cammy speaks with an American accent.Street Fighter II V  Cammy also makes an appearance in Street Fighter II V, again with an American accent but this time as a more honorable freelance assassin rather than a Shadaloo minion. She is hired by Interpol agent Balrog (actually a spy for Bison) to assassinate Inspector Dorai (Chun-Li's father) for destroying the Ashura syndicate, a branch of Shadaloo, although she is unaware that Balrog is working with Shadaloo and instead believes the Chief of Interpol, Barrack, has ordered the hit upon realizing Dorai is supposedly with Shadaloo. Cammy hangs Dorai from his balcony in Barcelona but fails to kill him and he is hospitalized. Cammy is later informed and goes to the hospital to finish the job, but is intercepted by Fei-Long, Dorai's star pupil. Cammy and Fei-Long fight brutally and appear to be even, until Fei-Long blurts out his intention to make both her and Shadaloo pay for their crimes. Realizing that she has been set up, Cammy enlists Fei-Long and Barrack's help in exposing Balrog, and makes sure to beat Balrog severely before leaving him for the authorities. Following this, she flees the scene, vowing to fight Shadaloo her own way.The Ties That Bind  After the fall of Bison and Shadaloo, Cammy enjoyed relative peace. However, while investigating strange energy readings coming from the Amazon River basin, she discovered dead animals everywhere and the shallow graves of various martial artists who have recently disappeared from around the world. Forensic analysis determined that the cells inside the animals were heated to boiling point, at which point they exploded. She called Guile to share the information as he and Chun-Li began investigating the disappearances. Together, the three found and exposed a lab that had been experimenting on further kidnapped martial artists. They discovered from the lab's data that the experiments were authorized by an arms manufacturer called S.I.N., and that the unusual energy readings and boiled cells were part of a project called BLECE, which could harness ki energy and weaponize it. They also discovered that Ryu - whose ki potential is incomparable - was the prime target for the project. When they finally located Ryu, Cammy rushed to warn him of the danger but failed to reach him before Crimson Viper, who at the time was believed to be an S.I.N. agent. Cammy arrived soon afterwards and warned Ryu not to use his power, as it would enable S.I.N. to capture its data, and confronted Viper instead. However, Viper surprised her with the abilities of her Battle Suit. Cammy attacks Viper, despite Ryu's warning. Viper easily catches Cammy's kick and delivers a devastating punch to her midsection, knocking the air out of her. After giving a kick to her face, Viper hoists Cammy up, places a hand on her chest and electrocutes her. Cammy falls to the ground, in a lot of pain. Viper brutally torture her in an attempt to force Ryu to unleash the Satsui no Hado. After finishing Cammy off with a Burning kick, she succeeded. However, the power surge destroys the monitoring equipment, and she was forced to flee. Cammy was evacuated for treatment, and later appeared alongside Guile and the US Coast Guard as they surrounded Seth's cruise ship, only for Seth to escape via a Shadaloo helicopter.Cameos  Cammy makes a cameo appearance in the 2012 Disney film, Wreck-It Ralph. In the first trailer of the film, Cammy can be seen for a brief second at Game Central Station in the right hand corner of the screen. Later in the actual film as the bad guys head off to Game Central Station, Cammy can be seen chatting with Chun-Li for a couple of seconds as they pass by the villains. Her outfit is nearly identical to her trademark Delta Red attire, except that instead of her usual barelegged appearance with green streaks, she's wearing light green tights. This change was made, most likely to make her outfit more modest, and thus, more appropriate, for a family-friendly setting.Comics Street Fighter Alpha manga  Cammy is seen in the South America underground conducted by Shadaloo, in which she fights Dan Hibiki. Being viewed from a monitor, Vega reveals that she is the result of genetic manipulation, and that she his superior to most fighters in every way despite her young age. Vega orders Cammy to slay Dan after the latter was weakened, but the fight is interrupted by Sodom (as the arena had rules to support multiple fighters joining any battle). After throwing Dan out of the arena, Sodom engages Cammy, easily overpowering her. During the fight, he causes injuries to her that free her from Shadaloo's control, and triggers her sense of pain.Sakura Ganbaru!  Cammy appears in\u00a0volume two of the manga. Having recently defected from Shadaloo, she fights against Gen, who was hired to kill her. Chun-Li, who was nearby with Sakura and Dan, decided to bring Gen into custody. However, Gen was able to quickly incapacitate her, Sakura then steps up to fight Gen. Near the end of their fight, Gen is close to finish the battle for good, but stops just one moment early, by a cherry tree leaf. Cammy asked why he spared Sakura's life when he was never hesitant to kill anybody before, Gen replied that, having found the \"light\", he no longer held the desire to kill. Sakura woke up twelve hours later, in the hospital, with Dan, Chun-Li and Cammy watching over her. Having discovered a lead to Ryu's location in Russia, the group find the national hero Zangief in a cage wrestling match inside a steel mill where he has just defeated Blanka, and subsequently knocks out Dan, who jumped into the ring to avenge his friend, with one blow. Zangief recognizes Cammy, as he had trained her while she was in Shadaloo and remembering how it had played him for a fool, he decides to take out his frustrations on her. Even though she is ready to throw the match if it means restoring Zangief's honor, Sakura enters the ring for a tag match, unwilling to let Cammy get pummeled to death. Zangief accepts to take on both of them, and Sakura's drive to fight to the finish eventually gets to Cammy, and the fight ends on a stalemate. Chun-Li and Cammy decide to part ways with the group there in order to resume investigation on Shadaloo, leaving Dan and Sakura to head for Thailand by themselves. Before they leave, Cammy asks Sakura to keep calling her by this name, even if she manages to remember her real name.Cammy Gaiden  19-years old Cammy, now working with Delta Red, is tasked to stop a hacker who has stolen all of their important data including their identities. His identity is revealed to be Alex Lewis, a hacker for a terrorist organization. Cammy infiltrates the hideout and takes the guards out with ease. Alex watches her from a monitor and compliments her skills in fighting. After the deal with the trade for his client is denied, Alex knocks him out cold with a kick as Cammy comes in. She acknowledges his skill but is caught of guard when he rushes and attacks her. Alex gives a brief speech of how Cammy acts and what she does, and thinks her popularity is overrated.   He has Cammy in a wrestling hold, Alex underestimates Cammy's strength however and she breaks Alex's arm. She mocks the hacker and finishes him off with her signature move \"Cannon Spike\". After his defeat Cammy could not find the missing data, but in return she saved the cat much to her boss's annoyance. However, Cammy's assistant finds the data on the cat's collar and Cammy distressed\u00a0the idea of underwear being in the data. He mentions that the data didn't have anything about Cammy liking cats which added as a benifit in getting the data back.Street Fighter by UDON  Killer Bee first appears sixty days after Gouken's assassination and Charlie Nash's capture. She receives orders from Shadaloo Central Headquarters to locate Ryu, who she tracks down to a restaurant in Chinatown, San Francisco, and continues to follow him and report to M. Bison. That same night, she tracks Ryu, Ken and Eliza to Ken's house, and continues to observe, listening to their conversation and realizing her target was about to leave the country. A flashback from six months prior to that time, Killer Bee is revealed to have been sent to Hong Kong to capture an agent of Interpol that had infiltrated in Shadaloo, Dorai. He is swiftly apprehended by Shadaloo agents as Cammy fight his daughter Chun-Li, before escaping herself. In her next scene, Killer Bee has been captured by Rose, who had sensed in her \"the potential to be human\". Using her powers, she \"killed\" the codenamed agent Killer Bee, freeing her and providing her with the name \"Cammy\". She appears in a flashback of Charlie, who tells Chun-Li how her father was set to fight Shadaloo's 13 Dolls, only to be killed by Killer Bee. In yet another flashback, from about a year before her capture by Rose, Killer Bee is shown fighting Vega as Bison's last test of her abilities, and manages to knock him down in a moment of distraction. Later in the flashback, she is seen in a restricted area, undergoing Shadaloo's Memory Algorithm Delete Program. Back to present day, Cammy wakes up on a bench in front of the British Embassy in Rome, Italy, with a note reading: \"Welcome to your new life, Cammy. Do not waste it.\" Already part of Delta Red, she is shown in a mission in the border between Germany and France, where the team struggles to escort a British cabinet minister from Berlin to home. During the mission, Cammy figures something was off when a wagon from the train they were in is disengaged, and walks into a secret Shadaloo operation, capturing agent Satsuki. Later, in Lieutenant Matthew McCoy's flat in London, Cammy explains her arrival to the British Embassy back in Italy. In the occasion, she walked right into a terrorist attack, and was forced to fight. By the time Delta Red arrived at the location, Cammy had handled the 30 terrorists mentioned to be in the area, and was quickly enlisted in Delta Red's training. Later on, she woke up from a nightmare involving her past as assassin and the genetic experiments from which Killer Bee was born. She called Colonel Wolfman immediately, informing him of her dream, and remarking that she never had one before. Upon interrogating Satsuki by herself, she was saluted as \"Commanding Doll Officer Killer Bee\", and pretended to be under cover so as to win her trust. She is given highlights of a past mission, in which she had assassinated Professor Rodmovic's team for the designs of an experimental weapon, of which the technology was being used to recuperate Bison's health, after his fight with Charlie in Japan. In a reunion in MI-6, she reports everything she learned from Satsuki, while George Ginzu gathered intelligence of Shadaloo's actions, figuring out that almost all of the organization's major cells were focusing operations in Brazil. With the help of Shadaloo agents, Satsuki escapes her cell and, later, the building, saluting Cammy for a last time while being lifted off by a helicopter. When Delta Red is shown dropping off in a dense Brazilian forest, she is seen leading the way, at somepoint, she is invinted to a tourmnent by Gill as she sees it as a way to get\u00a0closer to his plain do to the connection that his company has with Shadallo since Bison's disperanceStreet Fighter \u00d7 G.I. Joe  Cammy along\u00a0with Chun-Li and Guile are helping members of G.I. Joe after finding out that King Cobra has had some kind of an\u00a0alliance with\u00a0M. Bison in an effort to rule the world. In the second issue, Cammy is matched against M. Bison, who has organized a new World Warrior tournament, patrocinated by\u00a0M.A.R.S. She vows to put a stop to whatever he's scheming, as well as bring him to justice, all before the eight finals are over. Later on, Cammy watches Chun-Li as she fights against Zartan, who was disguised as Dan Hibiki. When Zartan revealed himself after defeating her, Cammy is appalled that this tournament has no rules. Guile deduced that someone wanted Zartan to win the match. Cammy promises to defeat M. Bison after what he did to her. Before her match, Chun-Li warns Cammy that M. Bison is big and strong, so she has to get inside to do any damage. Guile also mentions that she needs to be faster than him to stand a chance. However, Cammy states that she will get her hands on M. Bison and make him pay in his own blood. Bison stands from his thrown and punch it to reveal a Psycho Drive. As the Dolls attach the device to his back, Bison declares that this Psycho Drive is fueled by the other combatants and keyed to his specific biosignature, designed by Destro and M.A.R.S Industries. At the start of the fight, Cammy is able to hold her. She hits Bison with her Quick Spin Knuckle and a Neck Twist, furious at how he kidnapped, brainwashed and enslaved her. But when Cammy is on sitting on Bison's shoulders, he regains the upper hand, teleporting behind Cammy and claiming that she looked like she enjoyed being enslaved. He states that since he has all of this power at his disposal, he is going to 'destroy' Cammy, rather than just beat her. M. Bison grabs Cammy's head, lifts her up and throws her down to the ground. Before Cammy can recover, she is hit with Bison's Head Press, right on top of her face. He then grabs her by the head again with both hands, belittling Cammy for talking down to him. He finishes her off by driving the same fist straight into the opponent's stomach, similar to his Psycho Punisher. But sadly, he is far from done with Cammy. Guile, Chun-Li and the others watch helplessly as Bison continues to beat down Cammy with punches to her face, kicks to her legs and knees to her back and chin. Destro finally stops Bison after he is short of killing Cammy, stating that he already has won. As Bison holds the unconscious Cammy up by her hair, he laughs that it is never enough.Gameplay Moveset  Cammy is a quick, impressive, close range fighter. She lacks any projectile or long-reaching attacks, and therefore hurls herself at the enemy relying on speed and priority. For example, her standing hard punch can often cancel an opponent's attack outright, if it connects. Priority such as this makes her one of the easiest characters to use in Capcom vs. SNK 2. Her original incarnation in Super Street Fighter II had trouble evading projectile attacks, so later incarnations involved reworked and additional special moves to evade fireballs with ease. Her move set utilizes many kicks, but she also has several grabs, her trademark being her frankensteiner. At times Cammy also has a more brutal fighting style, such as her second ultra in Super Street Fighter IV. Cammy's overall style revolves around doing sudden and rapid sweeping attacks. Her move set allows the player to attack from almost any given range, and with great agility as a benefit. Her combo ability rivals that of Akuma, and can easily be on the toes of the opponent throughout the battle. However, her moves are a bit awkward to execute, and can make her vulnerable if blocked accordingly since her moves can put the player right in front of the opponent for an easy counterattack. Also, Cammy's offensive power lacks mix up, often requiring frame-traps and/or baits to open up defenses. Due to her fast offense however, she is able to apply solid wake up pressure and vortex mix ups. Overall, Cammy is a very versatile character with a great offensive game, with useful attacks to prevent her from being cornered.Actresses  Cammy fights in England in her first appearance, but her voice actors in the games always have either American or Japanese accents, up until Street Fighter IV where she now sports a proper English accent. She is voiced in the Marvel vs. Capcom series by Susan Hart (not to be confused with the adult film actress of the same name). Cammy appears as one of the heroes in the 1994 movie Street Fighter. She is portrayed by the famous Australian musician Kylie Minogue. In the movie Cammy is a British intelligence agent that is serving as Colonel Guile's intel officer and right-hand woman in the Allied Nations Army. In Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie and Street Fighter II V, Cammy's accent is American and she is voiced by Debra Jean Rogers. In Street Fighter IV: The Ties that Bind, Cammy is finally English again and voiced by Caitlin Glass. Caitlin continues portraying Cammy in Street Fighter\u00a0X Tekken and in Street Fighter V.Pop Culture  Cammy/Pop CultureTrivia Sprites  Cammy/SpritesSee also M. Bison  M. Bison, known as Vega (\u30d9\u30ac, Bega) in Japan, is a video game character and primary antagonist of the Street Fighter series, first appearing as a non-playable boss in Street Fighter II before becoming playable in its update, Street Fighter II: Champion Edition. He is a self-imposed dictator and megalomaniac seeking world domination.Biography Concept  M. Bison and his design were inspired by Washizaki (\u9df2\u5d0e, Washizaki \"Eagle Cape\"), a villain from the manga and anime Riki-Oh; and Yasunori Kato (\u52a0\u85e4\u4fdd\u61b2, Yasunori Kato), the antagonist from the fantasy film, Tokyo: The Last Megalopolis (aka Teito Monogatari (\u5e1d\u90fd\u7269\u8a9e, Teito Monogatari)).Appearance  His general attire consists of a red military uniform with large silver shoulder plates, wrist bands, and shin guards; on his peaked/service cap is the skull insignia of his crime syndicate known as Shadaloo. His clothing highly resembles the uniforms worn by SS officers of Nazi Germany; the winged skull on his visor cap and the first letter of Shadaloo on his belt is shaped as a single Sig rune. He sports a dark-colored cape in the Alpha series, in which he appears with his original body. From Street Fighter II on (and in the Capcom vs SNK series), he appears with a much slimmer body, and removes his cape before battle. M. Bison has neatly cut black hair under his peaked cap, which he is almost never seen without (save for two of his alternate costumes); in the Brazilian Street Fighter comics (Editora Escala), he was instead bald. His eyes were originally red both within and outside the irises (though the irises were still visible); after Street Fighter II: Hyper Fighting, they were changed to a complete ghastly white, a trait shared by other characters such as Sagat and Dhalsim. His eyes will glow pink when his Psycho Power is glowing. As of Street Fighter V, Bison's look has changed slightly, now wearing a trenchcoat over his outfit without the cape. His hair has also turned white due to the effects of the Psycho Power. He has two alternate costumes for this game;\u00a0the first is\u00a0his outfit colored to black and gold motif and the\u00a0second is\u00a0his former red military uniform (without his signature military peaked cap)\u00a0in tatters.Name change  When Street Fighter II was localized in the United States, Capcom was afraid of a lawsuit from Mike Tyson over a character (Balrog) with his likeness as well as a similar sounding name (Balrog's Japanese name being \"Mike Bison\"). Additionally, when the designers presented the game to Capcom USA's marketing department, they believed that the name \"Vega\" did not fit the character it was given to. They decided to rotate the names of three of the four boss characters in the following manner:Personality  M. Bison is an archetypal villain motivated by his own self-seeking interests and lust for absolute power through world domination. He is a megalomaniacal and psychopathic dictator and terrorist who seeks to rule the world with an iron fist whilst also being universally regarded as the greatest and most powerful martial artist of all time (stated in his own pre-boss fight dialogue with Ryu in Street Fighter Alpha 3), and will readily destroy anything or anyone who dares to stand between him and his shady goals. He shows a complimenting side, however, when he states to Karin Kanzuki that he watched her and Sakura fight, stating that they fight very well for girls and, after she defeats his Dolls, that Karin did well and is a qualified fighter. Possessing a vast ego and a god complex, Bison is physically incapable of feeling empathy for others and even takes pleasure in watching people suffer at his hands, never feeling a shred of regret or remorse for the numerous atrocities that he has committed. In many ways, Bison's characterization is comparable to the clinical diagnosis of a real-life psychopath. Bison's malevolence and sadism are reflected in his iconic smile, a very wide grin that exposes not just all of the teeth but even the gums as well. He occasionally refers to himself in the third person and displays a twisted sense of humor, as well as a \"business before pleasure\" attitude. As the founder and leader of Shadaloo, M. Bison uses as many illegal methods as possible to achieve his destructive and barbaric goals, ranging from drug trafficking and arms dealing to terrorism and illegal human experimentation. He is not above using coercion by force (as seen during at least one storyline in Street Fighter Alpha 3) and brainwashing to convert skilled martial artists to his cause, and has even cheated death and returned to wreak havoc not once, but at least twice. While demanding absolute loyalty and obedience from his subordinates, M. Bison considers them as mere pawns rather than human beings, and tolerates his henchmen only as long as they serve his dark ambitions, displaying his complete disregard for human life. For the same reason, he offers to spare others' lives on the condition that they pledge their undying loyalty to him. Unsurprisingly, he has earned the eternal enmity of many other Street Fighter characters for his malevolent and sinister nature. Of course, he usually does not care and tends to consider his numerous enemies as mere nuisances. Throughout various media, M. Bison is shown as an extremely powerful figure, often justifying his arrogance by being able to simultaneously take out multiple opponents through use of his Psycho Power (and often without it). In Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie, M. Bison soundly defeats Guile, and then proceeds to fight and nearly overpower Ken and Ryu, arrogantly relenting in order to prove his superiority. In Street Fighter: The Movie, M. Bison effortlessly kills plenty of AN soldiers in unarmed combat, but is shown to be no match for Guile and is forced to revert to his electromagnetism-powered suit (the film's stand-in for Psycho Power). The UDON comics show him as more than able to defeat several of the fighters he faces, including a Psycho Power-infused Charlie, and he meets his only match in Akuma. In the Street Fighter Zero 2 HK Comic only, when M. Bison faces Akuma, he performs an attack named \"15 Shadows\", in which fifteen shadows based on the characters from Street Fighter Alpha 2 (except Sagat, Akuma and himself) appear to grab and hold his enemy. In most of his appearances in crossover games, M. Bison has been deemed worthy of respect by villainous characters who would join forces with him, such as Magneto, Geese Howard and Rita Repulsa. Namco \u00d7 Capcom and Project X Zone also reveals a curious personality trait - he is hinted to be an extremely provocative and lustful man with an interest for women, as all the opponents he choose to copy using Doppel's powers were attractive girls like Chun-Li, Morrigan and Valkyrie (a fact that is also emphasized by the playable party).Relationships  As the leader of a criminal organization like Shadaloo, Bison has made many enemies.Allies F.A.N.G  F.A.N.G is consistently portrayed as an eternally loyal servant of Bison's who constantly showers his master with compliments and caters to his every whim, almost in a sycophant-esque fashion. Despite this, his loyalty only stems from F.A.N.G's respect of his master's immense power and has little to do with any emotional connections; F.A.N.G strives to be on the \"side that kills, not is killed\" and as such, joins Bison to fulfill this mentality. It should be noted that the character on his qipao can also be interpreted to mean \"To betray\", which may refer to his first interaction with Bison (a betrayal and assassination attempt) or his underhanded and sneaky nature in general. Ironically, this loyalty has led him to find ways in the underworld to bring back and revive Bison and Shadaloo, as it was officially stated that he survived the ultimate destruction of the base.Vega  Vega and Bison have a simple professional relationship. Apart from the usual curious attitude, Vega does not have frictions with Bison. However, the assassin does not seem to be interested in helping the Shadaloo leader conquer the world. Whenever the organization is destroyed, Vega reverts to his old lifestyle, but will not hesitate to join again should it resurface.Balrog  Balrog's personal affiliation with his employer M. Bison is incredibly distant. He cares very little for what Bison's schemes involve and begrudgingly follows his orders as long as he is paid.Enemies Rose  Rose wields the foil to Bison's Psycho Power, the Soul Power. Despite her eccentric nature, Rose is a threat to him and has managed to defeat Bison once before, though she too takes a fall from his hands as well. Due to Rose holding a power similar to his own, her body makes a suitable temporary vessel for Bison whenever his body is destroyed.Juri  Juri hates M. Bison with a passion, as his organization was responsible for the murder of her parents and the loss of her left eye, and she constantly plots to destroy him. Conversely, M. Bison regards Juri as he does many of his usurping 'pawns', if not most of his foes in general: a minor nuisance at worst. In spite of this, Juri and Bison are shown about to engage in another fight in M. Bison's ending, after Juri threatens that Bison should be less worried about where her special eye came from, and more about what she is about to do to him with it. Her contempt for Shadaloo and Bison would make her go as far as willingly work for the Illuminati in Street Fighter V under Helen (a facade of Kolin) and Urien.Seth  Even though Seth had served as both a potential new replacement body for Bison and as the CEO of Shadaloo's S.I.N. weapons division, Seth had personally vowed to not be a mere puppet of Bison via his own personal self-awareness as he seeks to eliminate Bison and take over Shadaloo himself for his own personal plans of world domination.Akuma  Bison seeks to kill Akuma for his attempt on his life and steal his Hado to increase his own power. Conversely, Akuma sees him as an even greater evil than himself that must be exterminated.Oni  As a trait that carries over from Akuma, Oni does not like Bison at all for wielding greater evil through underhanded means and wishes to destroy him as well.Ken Masters  Bison had brainwashed Ken into becoming Violent Ken via his Psycho Power, though the latter was able to break free from his influence in due time.Necalli  Necalli is an ancient evil spirit who seeks to devour strong souls (such as Bison's) as a part of an ancient prophecy.Sagat  Sagat had once served as both Bison's personal bodyguard and as a member of the Four Heavenly Kings of Shadaloo, being promised by Bison in the past that he would be able to get his revenge against Ryu, who had scarred his chest with the Metsu Shoryuken. However, Sagat had soon realized that anger and hatred wasn't the way to avenge and heal his personal pride and after seeing Bison brainwash Ryu with his Psycho Power, Sagat had soon turned against Bison, saving and freeing Ryu from his brainwashing while leaving Shadaloo in the process, with Sagat himself personally vowing to atone for his past actions and to also help stop and prevent Bison from achieving world domination.Secret Society  Unbeknownst even to Bison himself, the equally shady organization had secretly influenced the founding of Shadaloo, but now seeks Bison's destruction due to the dictator's faction becoming extremely uncontrollable, and a more deserving leader at hand. Working through Kolin, and manipulating various people and even deceased people such as Charlie Nash, the Secret Society saw through Bison's predicted destruction, with the exception of Ryu carrying out the prediction instead. Gill, and even his brother, the rebellious and treacherous Urien does not like Bison at all either.Chun-Li  Chun-Li despises M. Bison for his involvement of the murder of her father. She seeks to to take down Shadaloo and will do anything to defeat them. She does so in Street Fighter V and even Urien recognizes this feat.Cammy  Cammy was one of M. Bison's replacement bodies and her most hated enemy. As M. Bison is the leader of Shadaloo, it is believed that when M. Bison dies, Cammy either dies too or her body becomes taken over by M. Bison, none of which has happened or been confirmed quite yet.Ryu  Bison has repeatedly tried to capture Ryu in hopes of using him as a host body or brainwash him into being a member of Shadaloo. Due to Ryu having the Satsui no Hado sealed in him, this is part of M. Bison's plan to control that dark power for himself. Ultimately, it is Ryu who is the one to finally defeat Bison once and for all.Story Background  Almost nothing is known about M. Bison's past prior to his appearance in the mainline games and his country of origin is unknown. The only known details of his past is that he was at one point nothing more than a young martial artist like any other but with overwhelming ambitions, so in order to be the best in the world of martial arts, M. Bison murdered his own master before giving in to complete chaos. M. Bison's master was said to be the only known person in the world who could manipulate the evil power known as \"Psycho Power\" at the time and it is also said that, before his death, M. Bison's master passed the power to only three other students, M. Bison himself being one of them. Shortly afterwards, hoping to seek both knowledge and strength to become the strongest in the world, Bison sought out many practitioners of other fighting styles to defeat and learn of their techniques, in the pursuit of being able to reinforce and keep his title as the strongest martial artist in the world. One of them was Gouken, whom he confronted unsuccessfully to analyze and see for himself the power of Ansatsuken and its principle of Hado.[citation needed] Later on, Bison would somehow come into power over his syndicate of Shadaloo.Street Fighter Alpha 2  M. Bison, leader of the criminal organization known as Shadaloo, hears of a fighter named Ryu who defeated his new henchman, Sagat. Bison decides to recruit Ryu and begins the search for him. In the meantime, he is confronted by Rose, a mysterious woman who wields a power that is in many ways similar to his own. Rose wins the ensuing battle, only to find out that M. Bison has left the battlefield completely unscathed, which is elaborated on during the events of Street Fighter Alpha 3. Afterwards, M. Bison encounters Chun-Li; they have a brief duel, in which he toys around with the girl, before fleeing and letting Chun-Li know that he murdered her father. Bison is then finally able to track down Ryu, and at first attempts to persuade Ryu to join him by promising that he would make him the greatest fighter ever. Ryu refuses, however, and the two engage in combat; M. Bison wins and takes Ryu's body to his scientists for a brainwashing via exposure to Psycho Power, which actually occurs during Street Fighter Alpha 3 as well. During all of this, Bison would eventually encounter Charlie Nash, who is on a mission to defeat Bison. Although Bison wins in the first encounter, he would then be confronted by Charlie again by a waterfall, who informs him that the helicopter will arrive in five minutes, to which Bison retorts to Charlie to enjoy this time, as it will be the very last five minutes of his life. The two would clash, and although Charlie wins, he is then shot in the back by a military helicopter, and Bison finishes off Charlie by punching a hole through his chest (as shown in Bison's prologue story in Street Fighter V) which causes Charlie to drop his dogtags and fall to his possible grave. One of the Air Force soldiers working for Bison asks him if Charlie could survive, but Bison says that even if Charlie did, there was no coming back from it, as Charlie now knows that everything has a price.Street Fighter Alpha 3  By the time of Street Fighter Alpha 3, the Psycho Power begins pushing M. Bison's body to its limits. Having predicted this event, he had his scientists engineer a body that he could transfer his essence into in the form of Cammy: a genetically engineered girl created using M. Bison's DNA as a template, and part of his elite squad of Dolls, brainwashed young women who serve as assassins. However, over the course of Alpha 3, Cammy begins to develop self-awareness and goes rogue. Bison sends Vega to retrieve her, and then Juli, another member of the Dolls, when Vega fails. Considering alternatives for the spare body, M. Bison turns his sights to Ryu, one of the strongest fighters in the world, and the personal nemesis of his right-hand man Sagat. On his journey to find Ryu, M. Bison learns of Akuma, the lone warrior that employs fighting techniques similar to Ryu's, and the evil energy that surrounds him. In his story, when M. Bison defeats Akuma, he claims that the Satsui no Hado is \"less than nothing\", and that is only a matter of time before he claims Ryu\u2019s body. This may explain why, in Adon's storyline, M. Bison knows about the Shun Goku Satsu, and refers to it as a \"pitifully weak move\". In Ryu's storyline, M. Bison then sends Juni, another Doll, to gather data on Ryu. In order to lure him out, M. Bison kidnaps his best friend and rival, Ken Masters, brainwashing and pitting him against Ryu. Enraged by M. Bison's actions, Ryu manages to defeat Ken and free him of M. Bison's evil influence. Ryu then takes on M. Bison, but loses despite giving his all. Once defeated, Ryu is subjected to M. Bison's Psycho Power. Sagat, witnessing these events, objects and M. Bison responds by telling him he can finally have his long desired rematch with Ryu. As Sagat urges Ryu to snap out of M. Bison's hypnosis, Ken and Sakura attack M. Bison and engage him in battle, allowing Ryu to break free of M. Bison's mental grip. Once again, Ryu engages M. Bison in an epic battle. Suddenly, a strange connection is established between M. Bison's Psycho Power and the Satsui no Hado within Ryu. Realizing that the two energies are akin, M. Bison attempts to put Ryu under his control once again. With his friends urging him to prevail, Ryu manages to resist and strikes M. Bison down with a powerful Metsu Shoryuken (as shown during Ryu's ending). Bison is then temporarily incapacitated, and retreats to the Psycho Drive to regenerate himself. Meanwhile, Cammy, now acting on her own, manages to assemble the remaining Dolls and turn them against their master. The refreshed M. Bison appears and decides that the Dolls are no longer of use to him, therefore, they are to be disposed of. All of the Dolls fight back, but M. Bison informs them that if he is to perish, because of the psychic link between the dolls and him, they will experience the same fate. Nevertheless, the Dolls escape the Shadaloo base as their minds slowly begin to deteriorate. Cammy, with little time left, takes advantage of her genetic similarity to M. Bison in order to operate the Psycho Drive. Using it, she removes the psychic fail-safe on the Dolls and saves them. In the retconned event in Guile's ending, US military officers Charlie and Guile enter the base on a mission to stop the dictator, joined by Chun-Li. After learning that the bombardment of Shadaloo was called off due to corruption in Interpol and M. Bison's manipulation, Chun-Li realized that they would have to destroy the base themselves. As Chun-Li and Guile escape the explosive-rigged base, Charlie keeps fighting the resurrected M. Bison, and ultimately seems to sacrifice his own life to allow their escape. After the base was destroyed, Bison's soul, however, ends up surviving the explosion and takes control of Rose. Bison remains inside Rose's body until his Shadaloo scientists forge a new body for him, at which point he releases Rose from his control, and she awakens back at home, with few memories of what happened.Street Fighter II series  Sometime after gaining a new body, Bison uses Shadaloo to establish a base in a temple in Thailand. Bison also subjugated a nearby village to establish crime yet still supplied the village with their needs to keep his establishments and plans ongoing. To lure out Ryu once more, Bison announces the second World Warrior Tournament. During the tournament, Guile, Chun-Li, Ken, Ryu, and Cammy manage to foil Bison's plans and fight him in the wilderness of Thailand. During the fight, Bison was ultimately defeated by the group of fighters and was urged to surrender by Guile. However, Bison ultimately refuses and commits suicide by unleashing all of his Psycho Power to create an explosion that kills himself. Following this event, The government had tirelessly investigated the base and concluded that Bison and the other members of Shadaloo had died. Unbeknownst to them, however, Bison's soul managed to survive and was being transferred to yet another replacement body. Although this event is retconned and therefore, non-canon, M. Bison's plans are foiled by Akuma (who was not a competitor in the tournament) who catches him off guard and performs the Shun Goku Satsu on him, killing the Shadaloo boss in an instant. Akuma then takes M. Bison's place to fight the finalist of the dictator's tournament (it is unknown who the finalist was). Akuma mocks M. Bison for being the slave of his own power, not knowing that he is actually in absolute control of his Psycho Power. If the player wins the tournament as Bison, a non-canon ending will play where he states that there is no one left to oppose him, and alludes to Akuma as, \"The Ancient One\", mentioning that not even Akuma was brave enough to stop him. After the speech, and he successfully rules the world with no more opposition to get in his way. The ending narrator then asks if there is still any hope for defeating Bison.Street Fighter IV series  At some point before the events of Street Fighter II, M. Bison ordered the creation of at least 26 androids by S.I.N., the weapons division of Shadaloo. #15 (i.e. Seth) was chosen to be the new head of S.I.N., demonstrating a higher level of intelligence than the others. #15 was referred to indirectly as \"M. Bison's right hand\". Bison also had a Korean official murdered along with his family; the official's young daughter, Juri, barely survives, and #15 gives her cybernetic enhancements, deciding she can be used as a test subject since she already was a Taekwondo prodigy. After M. Bison's suicide, #15 takes the name Seth and makes his own attempt at world domination, beginning with the announcement of a new tournament. But Juri has a plan of her own and, apparently aware that M. Bison has survived, tries to pit M. Bison and Seth against each other in revenge for her parents' murder. Despite his soul not being transplanted into another body, Bison manages to manipulate events behind the scenes and even ordered both Balrog and Vega to capture Seth but would later drop him off to his headquarters, with Seth revealing that S.I.N has also been manipulating Shadaloo. M. Bison then takes the bait Juri had and returns, his soul transplanted to yet another new body (again not as powerful as the one from his Alpha days). Though his scientists try to dissuade him (their reasoning being that, in time, a new body could be created that could hold the Psycho Power in its entirety), M. Bison chooses the weaker body instead of remaining dead any longer, stating that he never imagined that Seth would go so far and it will only be a matter of time before M. Bison would inhabit his body, anyway. He then takes part in Seth's new World Warrior tournament, completely incapacitating his opponents in the qualifying rounds.\u00a0There, he\u00a0even meets C. Viper and threatens to kill her\u00a0if\u00a0she doesn't give\u00a0him her gadgets,\u00a0Viper declines and the two fight.\u00a0 M. Bison eventually reaches Seth's S.I.N. headquarters at the head of the remaining androids, attacking Seth for renouncing his mindless servitude, which makes him useless. Seth protests that he had almost rebuilt M. Bison's empire, which had fallen into decline since the second World Warrior tournament; however, M. Bison counters by saying that everything that has happened has, in fact, been part of M. Bison's plan. Standing over the helpless Seth, he is suddenly confronted by Juri, whose plan to have the two destroy each other failed, as Seth did not put up enough of a fight. Juri threatens M. Bison, who is unimpressed, and the two clash, and as revealed by Bison's Street Fighter IV ending, Bison prevails. Meanwhile, another android which had been fighting Abel shows signs of also developing self-awareness like Seth, and M. Bison promptly destroys it, remarking that Abel has grown since an unspecified last meeting. His exact relationship with Abel is unknown; however, it is heavily implied that Abel was somehow part of the experiments that created the androids, and may in fact be one of them. On his way out of the facility, M. Bison ambushes Rose, who was also at the S.I.N. headquarters; remarking that she owes him something, M. Bison incapacitates her and threatens to take it back \"with interest\". As he reaches his jet, however, he is confronted by Guy, who threatens to destroy the jet if M. Bison does not hand her over. Apparently in a hurry, Bison acquiesces and relinquishes the unconscious Rose. At some point during all this, M. Bison comes across Cammy and Decapre, and notes that Decapre is dying, but that \"a bargain could be made\". Cammy allows M. Bison to take Decapre in the hopes that he will save her.Street Fighter V  As expected, M. Bison returned in Street Fighter V. He was first teased at the end of Charlie's gameplay trailer in a sillouette unleashing his Psycho Power while laughing maniacally. His official reveal occurred on May 19, 2015.Character story  In his character story, C. Viper is about to infiltrate the rooftop of the Shadaloo base, but before doing so, she recounts what happened to Charlie Nash during his pursuit of M. Bison. Charlie finds Bison and is about to arrest him. He goes into a fight with him, not knowing what Bison is capable of using the Psycho Power. Bison defeats Charlie easily and throws him into a waterfall, leading to his disappearance and alleged death. On the rooftop, as F.A.N.G appears, C. Viper tells about him as well. F.A.N.G was a member of Nguuhao a huge cartel under Shadaloo's umbrella that was at a point obliterated by Bison. F.A.N.G was the only member whom Bison left alive, owing to his power. Following his defeat in a fight with Bison, he swears alliance to him and joins Shadaloo. Back to the present, Bison has a meeting with Vega, Balrog, F.A.N.G, Enero, Xiayu, Jianyu and some of his foot soldiers and wants to know about the status of the operation. F.A.N.G tells him that everything's in place and soon they can carry the operation out, which is to conquer the world. C. Viper is stitching the pieces of information together when she is spotted by Bison. Bison reassures his people that the operation cannot be stopped and soon everything will come to an end.A Shadow Falls  Bison devises a plan which includes a creation of seven Black Moons, a powerful satellites capable of causing havoc via electromagnetic pulse wave. The ensuing terror and chaos would fuel Bison's infamous Psycho Power to a near godlike level. His plan is put to a temporary halt as the pieces of the machinery that controls the Moons are stolen by one of Shadaloo's programmers working on the project. Bison then dispatches his generals to locate the rogue programmer and retrieve the missing pieces. We learn that the programmer has sent seven pieces to various street fighters all over the world. After the one of the pieces is recovered by F.A.N.G, a large city in North America (presumably New York City, although this is never explicitly stated) falls victim to one of Bison's Black Moons. Bison personally appears in the city after its decimation and witnesses the argument between his generals. The conflict in Shadaloo ranks ceases the moment Guile and Chun-Li appear at the scene. Chun-Li, eager to settle the scores with Bison, ignores Guile's warning and rushes headlong into the fight. She is, however, no match for Bison whose powers have now increased drastically due to the panic and fear caused by his weapon in the sky. Chun-Li is badly beaten and about to be killed, but Cammy's well timed intervention saves her. The trio escapes as Bison deems them unworthy of pursuit. Aware of the threat that Bison poses, the Illuminati Secret Society revive the corpse of Charlie Nash in order to make it into a weapon of assassination. His body enhanced through bio-engineering and his mind manipulated into believing that there is nothing left for him out there but the destruction of Bison, Nash embarks on a suicide mission. He manages to locate and infiltrate Shadaloo HQ, but, once confronted with Bison, the man that killed him long ago, he suffers a severe defeat. Realizing that Bison is now way too powerful for anyone to take him on, Charlie only manages to escape due to the appearance of Necalli. The ancient consumer of powerful souls challenges Bison as well, but even he gets overwhelmed by dictator's Psycho Power, now increased hundredfold. Bison manages to avert the ancient prophecy and defeat 'The Soul Consuming Darkness'. After he makes his escape from the Shadaloo base, Charlie is re-united with his friend Guile and the fighters that oppose Bison gathered around Karin Kanzuki. He begins to realize the potential of the Illuminati bio-engineering and the powers bestowed upon him. With the proper utilization, his new body is capable of absorbing and nullifying the Psycho Power. However, it remains to be seen whether it will work on someone as powerful as Bison. In the final attack on the Shadaloo base, determined Charlie faces Bison once more. Bison, now seemingly invincible due to the worldwide panic spread by his Moons, wins again. Nash, however, manages to absorb an enormous amount of Psycho Power before he is obliterated by it. With Rashid working on stopping the remaining Moons from descending, this effort proves to be enough to significantly weaken Bison. Having his special training completed by finally mastering the darkness within and taking out Necalli, Ryu shows up to stop Bison for good. Bison requests that Ryu shows him the power that defeated Necalli, and Ryu responds that it is not a power to defeat - it is the power to push forward. Bison scoffs and tells Ryu that power is just power, that the quest for ultimate power leads to conflict, and the conflict leads to the ultimate battle. He is nearly killed by Ryu but laughs and says \"We're not done.\" he then attempts to perform a Psycho Inferno but Ryu counters it with a Hadoken. Bison merely laughs as he fades away, consumed by the Power of Nothingness. His base soon crumbles into the ground along with his hat. After the events and Shadaloo's ultimate destruction, Bison becomes a mere specter that haunts people, such as his body replacements like Ed and Falke.Street Fighter Alpha: Warriors' Dreams  M. Bison appears as a secret character in Street Fighter Alpha, chosen in the Random Fighter box by either via a special input or by timing the choice correctly on him. Like all other characters, his storyline was retconned by Street Fighter Alpha 2. In his storyline, M. Bison defeats Shadaloo's opposition and confronts Rose, who claims that he has abused his powers and that he must be stopped. Bison insists that Rose stops making speeches and fight him. In his ending, M. Bison emerges victorious, commenting that Rose not only wasted his time, but her own life as well. He leaves while replaying the battle in his mind.Crossover appearances Capcom Fighting Evolution  In Capcom Fighting Evolution, M. Bison's ending shows him fighting and defeating Gill, with the other Four Kings of Shadaloo and the twelve Dolls watching. However, as M. Bison and his followers leave on Shadaloo's plane, Gill performs his resurrection technique, looking completely unscathed from the recent fight.X-Men vs. Street Fighter  In this game, M. Bison teams up with Magneto in pursuit of world domination, opposing Apocalypse. However, M. Bison's ending shows him defeating Magneto, intending to betray the mutant from the very start. Magneto's ending shows that M. Bison has lost the fight. Watching this, the other three Grand Masters (Balrog, Vega and Sagat) side with Magneto, creating the new Four Grand Masters of the Brotherhood of Mutants. Magneto then adapts the rest of M. Bison's technology to use it for mutant supremacy instead.Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter  M. Bison's ending shows him impressed with Apocalypse's technological improvements on Akuma. He uses it to create an enhanced version of Shadow as part of his quest for world conquest.Street Fighter X Tekken  M. Bison was first leaked through a screenshot in the Xbox Live Arcade, confirming his presence although a previous trailer shows the Shadaloo symbol. In the recent CG trailer, he infiltrates the Mishima Zaibatsu HQ by appearing through a liquid wormhole, and confronts its president Jin Kazama, the son of Kazuya Mishima, challenging him to a fight. In the meantime, his servant Juri takes on Ling Xiaoyu and prevents her from trying to protect Jin. For the most part, M. Bison seems to have the upper hand and uses a Psycho Crusher to try and drive him through the skyview window. However, M. Bison is held back as Jin's Devil Gene takes over. M. Bison's partnership with Juri is based on his suggestion that, despite their intense dislike for each other, the two are working together towards a common goal involving the mysterious Pandora. The two of them serve as the sub-boss for Tekken side characters; in the sub-boss cutscene, M. Bison appears through a wormhole, being posessed by the Pandora, stating that the player's characters quest has come to an end. M. Bison and Juri's rivals are Jin and Xiayou; if selected in Arcade Mode, Heihachi Mishima and Kuma will appear as their rivals. In the rival cutscene, M. Bison tries to deliver a sneak Psycho Powered punch in Heihachi while the latter is meditating. However, Heihachi blocks the punch, and push off M. Bison's fist. Heihachi tries to headbutt M. Bison, but he teleports himself near Juri, starting the battle. Both bosses seems to understimate each other, as M. Bison mocks Heihachi's age and Heihachi states that M. Bison is boring him. In their ending, M. Bison anticipates Juri's betrayal, and both trigger the power of Pandora in an attempt to take the other out.Street Fighter \u00d7 Mega Man  M.

Bison is the main antagonist of the 1994 anime film, voiced by Takeshi Kusaka in Japanese and Tom Wyner in English. As in the games, he is the leader of Shadaloo (here named \"Shadowlaw\") and seeks to take control of the world. His primary objective is to locate Ryu, who exhibited spectacular fighting potential during his battle with Sagat, and induct him into the organization as his right-hand man. During his search, he comes across Ken, who displays similar fighting potential and is a childhood friend of Ryu. Bison kidnaps and brainwashes Ken, setting him on Ryu while he personally duels Guile, whom he defeats with ease. When Ken breaks free of M. Bison's influence, M. Bison severely injures him and leaves him for dead while taking on Ryu; he toys around with Ryu for a while until Ken recovers and rejoins the battle. Although M. Bison is clearly a superior fighter, he decides to hold back so that he may fight the two 'on their own level'. This decision eventually turns out to be M. Bison's downfall, as Ryu and Ken finally manage to catch him off guard and deliver a combined Hadoken, which apparently obliterates him. M. Bison, however, reappears alive and well at the film's finale in a truck, attempting to run down Ryu. Ryu notices him just in time and prepares to do battle with him once again.Street Fighter II V  In Street Fighter ll V, Bison and his men are giving the back story that they want to stop all wars and corruption in the Goverments of Earth, seeing that the only way to save the world is to rule over it.Live-action movies Street Fighter: The Movie  M. Bison appears in the 1994 live-action movie as the main antagonist, portrayed by Ra\u00fal Juli\u00e1. In the film, Shadaloo is a small backwards nation in Asia, as opposed to an organization of unknown origin. Here, Bison is both a megalomaniacal former military general and a notorious wealthy drug kingpin who controls not only Shadaloo, but also the whole drug industry with an iron fist. One of his goals in the film is to produce supersoldiers as per his plan for world domination and establish a new order known as \"Pax Bisonica\" using his drug money. His ambitions have led to a war with the Allied Nations (AN), led by Colonel Guile, the movie's main character, in Shadaloo. He is shown as an ordinary human for most of the movie until his final confrontation with Guile, where he is granted lightning powers and the ability to fly, both provided through his tech suit and life support system. However, M. Bison is defeated by Guile and is buried after he hits his gigantic monitor, which violently explodes as the Colonel discovers that the dictator is defenseless while flying towards him. After the end credits, Bison's hand smashes through the rubble of his base, showing that he survived. Although Bison's nationality is not stated in the film, his British accent as well as his plans to conquer England before going after other countries suggests that he may be of English descent. The film was Ra\u00fal Juli\u00e1's final film role before his death shortly, and is dedicated to his memory. Although the film was largely panned by critics and fans, Juli\u00e1's performance was widely praised and he was nominated for a posthumous Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor. Despite being known as \"Vega\" in the Japanese versions of the games, he is still called \"M. Bison\" in the Japanese dub of the live-action film. For the role, Ra\u00fal Juli\u00e1 studied the lives and personalities of various real life dictators and drug lords, and incorporated several elements of them into his portrayal of the M. Bison character. This includes, but is not limited to, Benito Mussolini's hand gestures, Adolf Hitler's love of fine art and Pablo Escobar's elusiveness.Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li  M. Bison appears in this movie as the main antagonist, and is played by Neal McDonough. Here, M. Bison dons a stereotypical business suit, and is presented as a multi-lingual crime boss under the guise of a Bangkok-based Irish businessperson. Being from Ireland, M. Bison was abandoned by his Irish missionary parents in Thailand. \"Shadoloo\" (as it is referred to) is a multi-leveled criminal syndicate comprised of a plutarchy of an unknown number of powerful crime families that have connections ranging from the country's local mafiosos to even factions of the government (in the film's current case, the Department of Commerce). Though M. Bison's full goals are not divulged, his first order of business is to buy up an entire waterfront district and restructure it specifically for the wealthy and elite, thus further adding to the funding of his operations. He first appears as a simple mob head, only to skyrocket through the ranks after killing off a number of allied families and usurping their power for himself. He is depicted as being uncomfortably upbeat about everything, as he usually reveals shortly afterward that he is in control of almost every element of espionage and intrigue he is involved with. In this story, M. Bison has a more supernatural background than there was with his video game and anime counterparts. In a backstory told by Gen, M. Bison sacrificed his pregnant wife in the bowels of a mystic cave, where he imbued his daughter, Rose, with the goodness of his soul, thus ridding himself of any sense of conscience. His raw physical power is seen to borderline on unearthly, as he usually only required one punch or kick to send an opponent hurtling through the air. His power is first exhibited during his introduction, where his spiritual energy was so immense it heralded his arrival by a soft breeze inside Chun-Li's family manor. He is killed at the end of the film in front of his daughter when Chun-Li twists his head around by use of her legs. It is unknown whether or not M. Bison's powers will resurrect him. In a deleted scene where Nash is comforting Rose, her eyes glow with a deep red, indicating that his soul took possession of Rose's body in order to return to the living world.Live-action TV series Street Fighter: Resurrection  M. Bison appears in the final episode observing Ryu, Ken, Laura and Nash through a battered Decapre's eyes and sits down on his throne behind a massive spherical object before burning a chess piece with his Psycho Power and proclaiming that he shall let them come.Comics Street Fighter II manga  Bison appears in all the volumes as his company was responsible for Cho's and Chun-Li's father's murder, he and his\u00a0henchman\u00a0had traveled to japan after finding out that Cho had stolen Shadaloo secrets, they ended up destroying the temple that Cho went in, kidnappeding Ken, and taking out Cho and Gouken.

He and his men come across Ryu, Ken, Guile and Chun-Li as he tells that Sigma has made a mistake for trying to take over the world, he tells them that Shadaloo will be at their side to fight against Sigma and his robot army, he is eventually overpowered by Sigma, but was defeated by Sonic and Mega Man in their Super forms. After the battle, the portals that leads everyone back to their home worlds was beginning to fade into nothingness, as not even Bison could not keep a single one of the portals open. The collapse of reality was put to a stop, thanks to Xander Payne's plan of stopping the virus form of Sigma in another timeline through a Genesis Portal, everybody returned home to their own worlds, as nobody remembers the events of Sigma's plan to rule other worlds.UDON comics  In UDON's Street Fighter\u00a0series, M. Bison had a battle against his master\u00a0as she poses a threat to his plans of world conquest. Afterwards, he\u00a0murders\u00a0everybody\u00a0in her village, and Rose was the only one who lived, due to the positive aspects\u00a0of Soul\u00a0Power inside\u00a0her. Shadaloo had become well known to the\u00a0world as\u00a0the years went by as M. Bison murdered Juri's parents. At\u00a0some point, he had his\u00a0men create clone bodies\u00a0as a back up plain in case\u00a0anything should go wrong, as well as an army of bio androids that can copy any kind of data for Shadaloo. He also had Shadaloo\u00a0kidnap\u00a0young girls and brainwash them with Psycho Power.\u00a0In his quest of absolute power to control the world,\u00a0he had the Dolls\u00a0perform evil deeds, such having Chun-Li's father\u00a0murdered,\u00a0murdering innocent people, and even kidnapping cops, marines, and soldiers from the United States military and Japan. He captures Charlie\u00a0who tries to save a\u00a0cop that works for\u00a0Interpol\u00a0and experiments on him (thinking he could be of use to him) and had him go kill Chun-Li. After he goes after the power inside Ryu after seeing the Satsui no Hado awaken, he loses control\u00a0over Charlie and\u00a0loses his contact\u00a0with Killer Bee. He\u00a0then decided that he would murder\u00a0Charlie, Guile, and Chun-Li personally.\u00a0 As he found\u00a0them,\u00a0he incapacitates Chun Li and Guile without even having to resort to his Psycho Power. He then fights Charlie, who is fueled with M. Bison's Psycho Power (thus making him much more of a challenge than Guile and Chun-Li) and mortally wounds him; a\u00a0weakened Charlie, however, manages to destroy the cliff on which they were fighting, throwing M. Bison into an abyss. Later on,\u00a0his\u00a0Psycho Power goes into a different body and discovers that Killer\u00a0Bee (now\u00a0known as Cammy) has broken free of his control, and plains to bring her back, as Shadaloo found her,\u00a0he\u00a0takes\u00a0out\u00a0T.\u00a0Hawk, Cammy and Rose using only a portion of his vast powers. In the World Warrior tournament,\u00a0as he faces Ryu,\u00a0he faces Akuma. M. Bison then unleashes his full power and, in order to counter, so does Akuma. However, neither of them manage to gain the upper hand until the Psycho Drive is destroyed by Delta Red. This renders M. Bison weak, allowing Akuma to finally finish him off. Rose's\u00a0sprite immobilizes\u00a0him as Akuma delivers a Shun Goku Satsu and leaves M. Bison for dead as the island sinks into the sea. However, his soul escapes and begins to come up with a new plans with the Secret Society. Although M. Bison seemingly reappears in UDON's Super Street Fighter: New Generations and Super Street Fighter Volume 2: Hyper Fighting comics (which are based around the events of the Street Fighter III, Super Street Fighter IV and Street Fighter V) that actually turns out to be Twelve taking the form of the leader\u00a0of\u00a0Shadaloo. However, the real Bison appears in a secret Shadaloo base (in hiding)\u00a0and is told that Chun-Li has been captured by Vega but ends up escaping (not knowing that\u00a0Bison's\u00a0soul\u00a0has been\u00a0around and has\u00a0been planning on getting a new body). During the Street Fighter Legends: Cammy story, it was revealed that Bison had done more then just simply brainwashed the Dolls. He put some of his Psycho Power in each and every one of them,\u00a0even in Abel and\u00a0his prize doll Cammy (who he calls Killer Bee),\u00a0if he ever needed to control them or possess their body in case anything should go wrong.Street Fighter \u00d7 G.I. Joe  Bison is one the main villains in the crossover comic of\u00a0Street\u00a0Fighter x G.I. Joe along with King Cobra\u00a0of the G.I. Joe franchise. The two have allied against their common enemy, the United States government, to stop their interference with the duo's plans for world domination; M. Bison operates in the open alongside Cobra's minions, while King Cobra himself works in the shadows.Street Fighter vs. Darkstalkers  While Bison does not make an appearance in the comic crossover of Street Fighter vs. Darkstalkers, he is referenced by Chun-Li during her talk with Felicia.Other appearances Street Fighter EX series Background  M. Bison is in the process of developing his crime syndicate and underground army called Shadaloo. He is looking for particularly skilled and deadly fighters to join his ranks. After the first Street Fighter tournament, M. Bison recruits Sagat, who is devastated by the loss of his title as champion to Ryu. Bison determines that an efficient way of attracting that kind of talent is to host another worldwide Street Fighting tournament. Bison watches the matches with a keen eye, and he is delighted to see that Ryu has entered the tournament as well. After overhearing a discussion between Ryu and a man in a dark gi, he approaches Ryu and asks him if he would like to join Bison's organization. An angry Ryu passes, seeming only interested in trying to track down the man he just spoke to. Bison is disappointed with his response, and insists that if Ryu does not join Shadowloo of his own free will, Bison will see to it that he perishes. They launch into a fight and Bison uses the information he overheard about the death of Ryu's master to antogonize him. Bison senses a strange reaction in Ryu, and realizes that Ryu's peaceful mind has been replaced with a mind preoccupied by murder and death. Bison uses this to his advantage and assures Ryu that he will have the chance to kill all that stand in his way if he joins Shadowloo. Ryu half heartedly accepts, and Bison decides to test Ryu's will by pitting him against his own friend from childhood, Ken. However, Ken is able to snap Ryu's mind back to his old self. Bison is disappointed that the effect did not last, and decides to kill them both at once. Ken and Ryu fight back and defeat Bison. He sees a member of the US Air Force and an interpol agent enter the room at that time, and he hits a button that allows him to escape through a sink hole in the floor. Months later, Bison is surprised to hear from Sagat that another EX tournament is being held, and even more surprised to find out that Sagat insists on being allowed to rematch Ryu. Bison, furious that someone dared to usurp control of his tournament away from him, sends Cracker Jack and Vega to investigate the circumstances surrounding the tournament. He discovers that a tyrant going by the name Shadowgeist has arranged the tournament. Vega intends to put an end to it. Along the way he learns of a another fighter similar to Ryu who seems to be in the same altered state of mind. Before approaching him, Sagat yet again pleads for a chance for a rematch with Ryu. Bison consents to prevent Sagat from annoying him any further, and advances to meet Kairi. Just as he was about to engage Kairi in a fight, he was knocked out by an attack from a being that he could not sense. He lost consciousness briefly, but when he awoke, he saw Kairi fighting against a rather demonic looking being. Outraged by the being's audacity to interrupt Bison's fight, he used the Psycho Crusher attack on Garuda, and prevented Garuda from completing his fight with Kairi. They fought for some time, and Garuda executed the Soukon Dan attack on Bison. Rather than harming Bison, the souls joined with him and enhanced his Psycho Power. Garuda, not understanding what happened, fled the arena. When Bison looked around, Kairi was gone. At that moment, Chun-Li rushed in. Passionate about the chance to avenge her father's death at Bison's hands, she rushed in to attack. But Bison, in his enhanced state, was far more powerful than Chun-Li anticipated, and she was nearly killed as a consequence. When Bison was informed that Shadow Geist was getting away, he left Chun-Li to her fate and walked away. Still bent on finding new soldiers for his army, he declares the third EX tournament, and changes the rules so that all fighters must enter with a partner. He does this in order to use Vega as a spy while at the same time, making it appear that Vega is simply his partner. He knows that Shadow Geist will be unable to refuse the opportunity to return, and he eagerly awaits the chance to punish Geist once and for all.Endings Street Fighter EX Plus \u03b1  \"Mwhahahaha!\" Justice has been vanquished the moment his evil laughter began to be heard. Everyone who bore presense to him trembled before his Psycho Power. The Demon Bison, is there anyone out there who can stop him?Street Fighter EX2 Plus  \"Hawhahaha. Such worthy experimental materials we got here.\"\n\"With my Psycho Power abilities, I can create a strange power with SH-11... Hehheh, the new Shadaloo has been born!\"Street Fighter EX3  With his goal now completed, the Grand Master M. Bison went into the energy amplifier located in the basement. Stepping into the machine he feels its awesome power and yells, \"Yes!!... I can feel it... the power is pouring into all my vessels and cells...\" With his muscles and blood vessels bulging to new extremes he shouts, \"I didn't expect the energy of such pitiful losers could ever create such intense power!\" Finally M. Bison's eyes turn red, smiling, he proclaims, \"Now I am ready for the world. I shall revel in its destruction! Wha ha ha ha!\"Street Fighter EX3 (in team with Vega)  M. Bison sighed on his throne, \"I thought they would be much stronger... What a disappointment!\" Vega, who was standing beside him, said calmly, \"They are so weak that they could not have been a match for us.\" The room resounds with Vega's unearthly laugh, as M. Bison taunts, \"So, you say you can be a good match for me? You could cut my head off in an unguarded moment.\" Vega licks his claw and says, \"An unguarded moment? Hee Hee Hee... I'll claw you to the death beautifully and quickly... at any moment.\"Other media Street Fighter: The Storytelling Game  In the role-playing game from White Wolf, M. Bison gained psychic powers from an alien meteor. Based on these powers, he created his own fighting style, which he calls Ler Drit.Gameplay Fighting style  In the games, M. Bison fights with a self-taught style using the Psycho Power. In the non-canonical Street Fighter: The Storytelling Game, M. Bison is said to use the martial art developed and taught by himself, Lerdrit. Though in reality, Lerdrit is actually a Thai form of martial arts taught and used by the Royal Thai Army. It should be noted however that while M. Bison's fighting style in the games is original, it may borrow elements from Lerdrit.Moveset  In the games, M. Bison wields his deadly Psycho Power to great effect; he is known for his trademark Psycho Crusher, which sends him flying in the direction of his opponent with a damaging \"torpedo\" spin. The Double Knee Press (or Scissors Kick) allows him to do a forward flip which will knock the opponent away. With the Head Press, M. Bison jumps into the air and homes onto the opponent, bouncing off their heads, he can follow up and smack them with a diving hand thrust called the Somersault Skull Diver. M. Bison also possess the Devil Reverse, wherein he leaps forward like the Head Press, but then flips upside down and chops the enemy with a Psycho Power-charged hand when any punch button is pressed. This acts as both a fake-out version of the Head Press and as a viable attack, fittingly allowing M. Bison to play with his opponent's head. In the Alpha series, his Psycho Crusher is a Super Combo (on A-ISM or Z-ISM) instead of a regular move. He also gained a couple of new moves, such as the Psycho Shot and the ability to teleport and hover in the air. In Street Fighter V, M. Bison has a more aggressive play style than before with air juggles and on/off-the-ground attacks, his crouching Heavy Kick (sweep) knocks opponents into the air and his Head Press can now hit grounded and airborne opponents. M. Bison gains the Psycho Reflect, the move reflects projectiles back at the opponent similar to Rose's Soul Reflect. M. Bison gains Psycho Blast and Psycho Inferno. M. Bison's teleport is incredibly fast where he can teleport just before a project hits unscathed with little recovery time. His EX Scissor Kick now hits multiple times. M. Bison's V-Trigger allow him to warp from the air to the ground and perform a psycho-infused Head Stomp twice.Super Combos  His Super Combos include the Final Psycho Crusher (\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30ca\u30eb\u30b5\u30a4\u30b3\u30af\u30e9\u30c3\u30b7\u30e3\u30fc, Fainaru Saiko Kurassh\u0101) - which is his most powerful attack in Street Fighter Alpha 3, exlusive to his Shadaloo-ISM form, which takes up the whole screen when used - and the Knee Press Nightmare, which is a super version of the Double Knee Press. In Street Fighter IV, he gains the Nightmare Booster Ultra Combo, which is a combination of all of his special moves (two Double Knee Presses, followed by a Psycho Crusher which carries the victim upward, after which he flips upside down similar to the Devil Reverse, smacks the victim to the ground, and ends it with a full-body version of the Head Press). From Super Street Fighter IV onward his second Ultra, Psycho Punisher, sees Bison jump up into the air and deliver a falling stomp with both feet and if the opponent is caught in the stomp's shockwave Bison grabs them by the face and lifts them off their feet, then drives his other fist into their stomach and fires a blast of psycho power into their abdomen. In Street Fighter V, Bison's Critical Art appears to be the Ultimate Psycho Crusher with elements mixed from Street Fighter II V. Upon activating his Critical Art, he releases a large barrier of Psycho Power around him. Anyone hit within the blast, is knocked into the air where Bison is flying while charging up with one hand his Psycho Power and then charging with both hands, then finally performing his signature attack in one hit against his opponent into the wall.As a Final/Hidden Boss  A more powerful form of M. Bison with stronger abilities and fewer weaknesses appears as the final boss of Street Fighter Alpha 3 for every character except Evil Ryu, who fights Shin Akuma, and M. Bison himself. Should the player lose and not continue, an edited version of M. Bison's ending will play, and the game will end. Unlike Akuma's Shin form, this version of M. Bison has no official name and looks identical to the regular version. There are some minor differences with this form aside from damage output. His fierce punch attacks send out a wave of energy and his Psycho Crusher Super Combo fills the whole screen with a devastating streak of blue flames. This improved Psycho Crusher is much faster and stronger than its normal counterpart, cannot be blocked in the air, and inflicts severe damage even when blocked; it is the most powerful move in the game. He also has a different theme song, called \"Brave or Grave\". The player is also able to choose this version of M. Bison as a 4th ISM, dubbed Shadaloo-ISM (or S-ISM), in the console versions of Street Fighter Alpha 3, by choosing Bison with the select button. He also has other forms that appeared in both Street Fighter EX2 Plus (Bison II or Vega II (\u30d9\u30acII, Bega Ts\u016b), and Street Fighter EX3 as a secret computer-only boss character (Shin-Bison or True Vega (\u30c8\u30a5\u30eb\u30fc\u30d9\u30ac, Tur\u016b Bega)). Bison II appears in a black uniform while in Street Fighter EX 3 only, Shin-Bison appears with pale, indigo-tinted skin and a white uniform. In both of these games, these forms have an infinite amount of SC energy. They also tends to be far more aggressive and makes frequent use of his teleporting ability.Trivia Gallery  M. Bison/GallerySprites  M.

It is the first Street Fighter game in the main series released by Capcom since the arcade release of Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike in 1999 and the first game in the IV sub-series. The arcade version was released in Japan on July 18, 2008 and was given a limited release in North American arcades in August. Home versions were released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on February 12, February 16, and February 20 in Japan, North America, and Europe respectively. The Windows version of the game was released on July 2, July 3, and July 7, 2009 in Japan, Europe, and North America respectively. The iOS version of the game was released on March 10, 2010. The latest release of the game is on Android OS, released on January 5, 2012.Gameplay  While Street Fighter IV features fighters and backgrounds rendered in 3D, the gameplay remains on a traditional 2D plane. Producer Yoshinori Ono has stated that he wanted to keep the game closer to Street Fighter II than its sequels, and as such the parry system from Street Fighter III has been dropped. A new system called Focus Attacks (Saving Attack in the Japanese version) has been introduced, as well as Ultra Combos. The traditional six-button control scheme returns, with new features and special moves integrated into the input system, mixing classic gameplay with additional innovations. The game has a very similar feel to Super Street Fighter II Turbo, but also has several natures from Street Fighter III 3rd Strike. Pressing both light attack buttons is still for throwing, and both heavy attack buttons are for the personal action or taunts. Both medium attack buttons are for the newly added Focus Attack. Dashes and quick standing are also in the game. Crimson Viper is the only character who can perform a high jump. Ibuki later joins her in that group when she is added to Super Street Fighter IV. It was intended that the car-smashing bonus rounds from earlier Street Fighter games would return. Ono later stated that the bonus stages would not be in the arcade game, citing the reason to be that the time players spend on bonus stages takes money from arcade operators. This may also explain the option to turn off the bonus stages in the arcade mode on the home console versions of Super Street Fighter IV.Visuals  The characters and environments in the game are rendered as 3D models with polygons but use a stylized effect to give them a hand-drawn look, with certain select attacks displaying ink sprays during the fights. The art director and character designer is Daigo Ikeno, who previously worked on Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike, aims at staying true to the Street Fighter II style.Focus Attacks  Focus Attacks, known as Saving System in the Japanese version, was a new system introduced in Street Fighter IV. The Focus Attack is a move that allows the player to absorb an attack and launch a counterattack, and it is performed by pressing the medium punch and kick buttons simultaneously. The system aims to make ground attacks as viable a way of approaching opponents as jumping was in previous games. The Focus Attack system is a core part of Street Fighter IV gameplay. Ono has stated that this system was incorporated in order to shift the emphasis away from combos and toward a more realistic system he has compared to boxing, in which \"the skill is in reading your opponent's move before he starts moving ... We haven't forgotten about combos and linked moves, but focus makes it so that you have to read your opponent.\" [citation needed]Ultra Combos  Super Combos, the powered-up special moves that have been a series' mainstay since Super Street Fighter II Turbo, return in Street Fighter IV. Similar to Super Turbo, each character has one set super move. The game also features EX Special Moves, the powered-up versions of Special Moves from the the home version of Street Fighter: The Movie. In addition to Super Combos, the game also features Ultra Combos. Ultra Combos are performed similarly to the character's Super Combo but are executed with three attack buttons (much like the Lv. 3 Super Combos in the Street Figher Alpha series and the Meteor Combos in Street Fighter EX3). Ultra Combos are long and cinematic moves usually featuring a lengthy combination of punches, kicks and other moves. Just as there is a Super Combo Gauge, there is also an Ultra Combo gauge (officially known as the Revenge Gauge), but whereas the Super Combo meter fills as the player hits an opponent, the Revenge Gauge fills when one takes damage from the opponent. Along with Super Combos, Ultra Combos are one of the only times the camera breaks from its normal fixed position to show a more dynamic, or cinematic view of the gameplay. Additionally, when the camera shifts to this cinematic view, the opponent's facial expression will change to a look of surprise and panic. This is easier to see on some Ultra Combos than others, especially if the camera pans around the person in some way.Plot  Street Fighter IV takes place several months after the events of Street Fighter II. After Seth's escape, the S.I.N. corporation began another fighting tournament in order to draw out the most powerful fighters on Earth to complete the BLECE project. Each character has their own reasons for entering this tournament, but S.I.N.'s real desire is to lure Ryu to them in order to analyze the Satsui no Hado, believed to be the last piece of data needed to complete BLECE. The tournament is publicly organized by S.I.N., apparently using preliminary matches and a point system to determine who is allowed to enter (as shown by the conversation between Seth and his lackey about how Dan Hibiki was able to \"squeak by with just enough points to qualify\"). It can be assumed that the only participants in the tournament are the playable characters in SFIV not including Seth.Characters Arcade roster  Chronologically set between the Street Fighter II series and the Street Fighter III series, Street Fighter IV was initially meant as a return to the series' roots, i.e. Super Street Fighter II Turbo, which Ono considers to be \"the king of Street Fighter games.\" Thus, the experience provided by Super Street Fighter II Turbo became the main influence for the Street Fighter IV development team, and all its characters were intended to be in the game. However, the four characters introduced in Super Street Fighter II were dropped for the arcade version of the game, so the final playable character roster became that of Street Fighter II' - Champion Edition, along with four additional characters, new to the series. Despite this, Cammy and Fei-Long were later added in the home console version of SFIV, while T. Hawk and Dee Jay were added in Super Street Fighter IV.Home version additions  The home versions of Street Fighter IV feature additional characters not included in the arcade version of the game. They are Cammy (the top voted character suggested for the home version of the game in an online poll posted on Capcom's English site), Fei-Long from Super Street Fighter II, Dan and Rose from Street Fighter Alpha, Sakura from Street Fighter Alpha 2 and Gen from the original Street Fighter and the Street Fighter Alpha series. In addition, the two computer-only boss characters from the arcade version, Seth and Gouken, are also both playable in the home versions, and Akuma is a hidden character.iPhone/iPod additions  Dee Jay Character - Unlockable when Arcade is finished 1 time (in the most recent updates).

Unknown: Training StageDevelopment  Before producer Yoshinori Ono pitched the idea to former Capcom R&D head Keiji Inafune, the prevailing attitude around Capcom was that a new numeric entry to the Street Fighter series would not be made. Initially, there was much resistance to Ono's pitch for a new Street Fighter game so many years after the original. The gap from 2000 to 2008, since Street Fighter EX3, the latest Street Fighter game at that point, represented the longest time the series had gone without a sequel. However, in light of fan demand plus the positive reception to Street Fighter II' Hyper Fighting on Xbox Live Arcade, Inafune eventually allowed the project to begin. This was Ono's first take on a new entry for the Street Fighter series as a producer, although he had previously worked on Street Fighter III 3rd Strike as a \"sound management director\" and previously produced Capcom Fighting Jam. The experience provided by Super Street Fighter II Turbo became the main influence for the Street Fighter IV development team. The original game concept, titled Street Fighter IV Flashback, imagined in part by David Sirlin, the designer of Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix, never made it past the proposal stage. Flashback would likewise feature the 2.5D gameplay and a roster made of classic Street Fighter II characters plus Sakura and a few new characters. The game would have also featured a single-player mode with third-person 3D action (similar to that of Sony's God of War series) that focused on Ryu's backstory, as well as all Street Fighter arcade games in their original forms and a 3D version of Super Turbo. Flashback's proposed easy control system was later used in Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Ultimate All-Stars, minus its titular \"flashback\" gameplay feature. While Street Fighter IV features models and backgrounds rendered in 3D, the gameplay remains on a traditional 2D plane, with the camera having freedom to move in 3D at certain times during fights, for dramatic effect, similar to the Street Fighter EX series Capcom produced with Arika. Initially the title had been developed to use 3D hitboxes, but the testers felt it didn't have the \"pixel perfect\" precision of a Street Fighter game, and the game was therefore changed to use 2D hitboxes. Ono has also cited the arcade version of Arc System Works' Battle Fantasia as the inspiration for the game's three-dimensional art style. Art director and character designer Daigo Ikeno, who previously worked on Street Fighter III 3rd Strike, opted for non-photorealistic rendering to give them a hand-drawn look, with visual effects accented in calligraphic strokes, ink smudges and ink sprays during the fights. The game runs on the Taito Type X arcade board inside a Taito Vewlix cabinet and takes advantage of the Type X's network capabilities and allows players in separate machines within the same LAN to fight each other.Versions Home versions  Street Fighter IV has been released for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Microsoft Windows.

Another update added Elena, Juri and Rose.Reception  Reception for the game has been overwhelmingly positive, with scores appearing in reviewer's top rankings. Joe Juba from Game Informer's stated that the game, \"...is a distillation of everything the genre does right. It delivers the intensity of competition...all through elegant techniques that are easy to learn and difficult to master.\" James Meilke of 1up.com wrote that, \"It's a bold, confident fighter that celebrates its heritage while bringing fresh, new ideas to the table, arriving in a remarkably complete package...\" while Dan Amrich of Official Xbox Magazine stated that, \"If you\u2019re a novice, a training mode and eight levels of difficulty will help you find your way. If you\u2019re a pro, SFIV contains all the depth you\u2019ve ever loved about the series, without compromise.\" In the Plus section of the review, he states that it, \"Does the impossible: Preserves the past, embraces the future.\" Criticism came to the anime-style scenes, \"...these cutscenes are almost a disgrace to anime as they are so poorly animated and tell you almost nothing about the story or the context for each character's participation in the tournament,\" wrote Ryan Clements of IGN. James Mielke also added words about the featured stages in the game, stating that, \"Sure, Drive-in at Night, Crowded Downtown, Pitch-black Jungle, Deserted Temple, Cruise Ship Stern, and Small Airfield are nice enough, but anyone longing for E. Honda's onsen hot spring will be left wanting.\" Street Fighter IV is also rated on Gamestats.com. The Xbox 360 version has an overall score of 9.0 and the PlayStation 3 version has an overall score of 9.1.Merchandise Controllers  MadCatz has released two licensed FightSticks and five wireless GamePads to coincide with the game's release. The Tournament Edition FightStick features a Sanwa joystick and 30mm buttons, as well as various modification abilities. GamePro's official review of the stick(s) state that the Tournament Edition also comes with a compartment to store the sticks' cord, along with rubber feet located on the underside. The Tournament Edition will retail at $150.00 USD, however only 3000 are being produced with MadCatz receiving over 20,000 pre-orders. The basic FightStick is considerably smaller in size, but has been reviewed to be for intermediate players, and has the capability to be rested comfortably on a player's lap. The face of the controller is marked with a graphic displaying the original eight fighters from Street Fighter II, but it is clear the stick can be modded. The model retails at $79.99 USD for the Xbox 360, and $69.98 for the PS3. Both FightSticks position the Start/Select buttons on the rear side of the model. Turbo, Home (PS3) and Guide (360) buttons are located on the upper left corner of the models, as well as a lock switch to keep from accidental initiation during play. Also both FightSticks ships with detachable wires, for easier switching out buttons and joystick. The GamePads features graphics of Ryu, Ken, Chun-Li, Blanka, and Akuma, and retails at $39.99 USD. The pads feature an 8-Way floating D-Pad, along with the trigger (R1 and R2 for PS3) buttons located directly onto the face. The button layout is similar to the FightSticks, with the Guide (Home) button located on the lower area of the controller.Trivia See also Updated versions Other External links Sagat  Sagat (\u30b5\u30ac\u30c3\u30c8, Sagatto, Thai: \u0e2a\u0e01\u0e31\u0e14) is a video game character from the Street Fighter series, first appearing as the non-playable final boss in the original Street Fighter. He later returned as a boss in Street Fighter II before becoming playable in its update, Street Fighter II: Champion Edition. He is the \"Emperor of Muay Thai\" and a former member of Shadaloo, where he acted as a personal bodyguard for M. Bison.Biography Appearance  Sagat is characterized by his intimidating appearance and towering muscular build; he wears Muay Thai trunks with colors varying from purple with yellow trim, to blue with red trim, to blue with yellow. He also wears the hand and feet wraps common to many Muay Thai practitioners. Sagat is the fourth-tallest character in the whole Street Fighter franchise, behind T. Hawk, Hugo and Abigail. According to his various bios, his natural size drove him to become a powerful fighter. There is evidence to suggest that Sagat may have the physical disorder of Gigantism, a disorder that causes abnormally high amounts of physical growth, due to his incredible height. In Street Fighter V, his original outfit became his Nostalgia costume. Sagat is depicted as being totally bald, except for a particular artwork that shows him with a full head of long reddish-brown hair, which has since become the basis for his third alternate costume in Street Fighter IV. A black eye-patch covers his severely damaged right eye (though it does not appear in Street Fighter II V), and the other visible eye is completely white; the lack of depth perception and loss of peripheral vision do not seriously hamper his ability as a powerful fighter, likely due to monocular cues. The massive scar on his chest is a result of a fated fight with Ryu in the original Street Fighter (explained below). Sagat makes no attempt to conceal the disfigurement, and in fact literally draws power from the hateful memory it invokes. Sagat's ending in\u00a0Street Fighter Alpha 2 shows him in a white muscle shirt, grey jeans, and grey fingerless gloves. In the same scene,\u00a0Balrog\u00a0wears the same clothes (while keeping his boxing gloves on), implying that it may have been an official\u00a0Shadaloo\u00a0uniform. In Street Fighter V, Sagat mostly remains unchanged, he now wears a dark blue tattered capris with an orange and yellow belt, and is covered with a short green tattered cloak with matching wraps on his arms and feet. He also have smaller scars around his chest, and covering the limbs too. His first alternate costume is the same as his original outfit being violet and green. His eye patch is replaced with matching pink cloth bandages. His second alternate costume is the same as his current outfit but it is ochre with a gold trim and his tie was capri blue and he wears a gold necklace with a sapphire gem on front adorned with a loose white necklace with rose designs.Graphics Issues  In the Street Fighter II series, Sagat's in-game sprite does not display the highly muscular build of the Street Fighter Alpha series, although even at that time he had been consistently portrayed as such in his Super Street Fighter II Turbo ending, and other Capcom artworks. Later on, the game graphics improved to match those of the comics. Due to a technical limitation in games prior to the 3D Street Fighter EX and Street Fighter IV games, Sagat's eyepatch will appear to switch from eye to eye when Sagat faces another direction, since the left-facing sprite is a mirror-image of the right.Concept  It is generally believed that Sagat is based on a real-life Muay Thai fighter named Sagat Petchyindee (\u0e2a\u0e01\u0e31\u0e14 \u0e40\u0e1e\u0e0a\u0e23\u0e22\u0e34\u0e19\u0e14\u0e35), but Capcom has yet to confirm this.[citation needed] Sagat himself was also said to be inspired by Reiba, the Muay Thai lord from manga Karate Baka Ichidai.Evidence of this shows up in Inafune's original design. Sagat's alternate costume in Street Fighter IV may hint at this, as the costume has matching leggings like Reiba in the manga. According to Street Fighter co-creator Finish Hiroshi, Sagat's style was modeled after dramatic television kickboxing personalities; particularly that of Muay Thai/Thai. The central theme of Sagat's character is \"tiger\"; this is a likely reference to an old Muay Thai tale about the nicknamed Siamese Tiger King, who loved competing in Muay Thai and gained Burmese respect for his country after defeating multiple Burmese soldiers in back to back fights.[citation needed] In the context of East Asian culture, the tiger and the dragon have often been considered as equally strong rivals, and are symbolic of many dualistic traits; the dragon is often associated with the heavens, the concept of spirit, things of yang affinity, and the eastern world, while the tiger is often associated with the earth, the concept of matter, things of yin affinity, and the western world. In addition, in martial arts, the dragon is symbolic of a 'soft' style and internal-based martial arts, whereas the tiger is symbolic of a 'hard' style and external-based martial arts. This makes his rivalry with Ryu (which means \"dragon\" in Japanese) especially notable.Personality  Sagat encompasses a stereotypical \"proud fighter\" personality, since he is very powerful and strong-willed, as well as hard-working; he is dedicated in body and spirit to martial arts life. His uncommon physical appearance makes him menacing and downright unfriendly at first glance, which holds true to a certain extent. In contrast to his initially violent and sometimes cruel nature, Sagat appreciates opponents that are worthy and of strong character, and greatly despises taking unfair or dishonest advantages in combat. His more honorable traits come to the forefront during his storyline development, and his pride gives way to an honesty of sorts similar to Ryu, his purpose now defined by the \"heart of battle\". Sagat also has a lot of regret and bitterness towards his former sins, especially the killing of Go Hibiki (despite the latter taking out his eye). Sagat even spared his son Dan when he came for revenge, seeing how easily hatred can corrupt the soul. Sagat's win quotes show him to be a proud and belittling man; this has long since given way to a more honest, advisory side, that still contains his characteristic straight-to-the-point bluntness, which is present to a fault. Despite his seemingly cruel mannerisms, Sagat has a capacity for goodness, as seen in Street Fighter X Tekken, where he helps Dhalsim find and rescue missing village children. Even when offered the mighty power of Pandora, Sagat refuses saying as \"a king like him doesn't need the power of the Gods\", and makes the children's safety his top propriety.Character relationships  As a former member of Shadaloo, Sagat has made a lot of enemies, including it's members after he defected. Though, after his redemption, he has made friends as well.Allies Ryu  After his defeat at the first World Warrior Tournament, Sagat initially fed on his hatred towards Ryu and his shame, seeking a new chance to challenge and defeat him to restore his title of greatest fighter and his lost 'honor'; although Sagat was technically the winner of the first World Warrior tournament (by pinning Ryu), he considered himself to have lost due to his scarring. His hatred towards Ryu has long since cooled, and the two are now more amiable rivals; in Sagat's Alpha 3 ending, both Sagat and Ryu admit that he was the stronger fighter and that Ryu was not ready to face him. As such, despite enjoying tournaments, he turns most of his attention towards Ryu, the person he now considers \"the only man able to defeat him and worthy to be faced in a life or death battle.\" In Super Street Fighter IV: Arcade Edition, if\u00a0Sagat faces\u00a0Evil Ryu\u00a0as a boss, his win quote against the latter states he is dismayed at Ryu for giving in to the\u00a0Satsui no Hado. As revealed in Street Fighter V: Arcade Edition, ever since his defeat at the hands of Ryu in the first tournament, it turns out the Satsui no Hado which infects Ryu, also infects Sagat too, with Sagat now finally understanding why Ryu found a new quest to purge the Satsui no Hado in order to be a true fighter, inspired by the latter\u2019s path to do a same thing.Dhalsim  Though he disproves of Dhalsim's mercy, Sagat has a strong respect for the yoga master and even trains with him in the Udon comics. In Street Fighter X Tekken, Dhalsim asks a favor of Sagat, telling him of missing children from his own village. The two decide to team up and search for Pandora, believing the power within it may help them find the missing children. Eventually reaching the Antarctic, the two find the missing children, and Pandora opens before them. Dhalsim tells Sagat that Pandora \"is said to be a power to rival the Gods\". Sagat decides that \"a king has no need\" for the box, and the two walk off into the distance, with Pandora closing behind them.Gouken  Gouken has long desired to fight Sagat to see how strong he is and states he is worthy of his title of \"King\". Sagat noted that Gouken's fighting Style and power is similar to Ryu's and wonders if there is a relationship (Master and Apprentice) between them.Enemies Dan  Normally, Sagat regards him as a nuisance, as most other characters do. However, Sagat was responsible for the murder of Go Hibiki during his time as a Shadaloo enforcer (the same incident also resulting in the loss of his right eye), prompting his son Dan to seek revenge. By the time Dan finally encounters him, however, Sagat is in the middle of a spiritual crisis, and throws the ensuing match in order to satisfy Dan's desire for revenge, as Ryu did for him. Dan has since been inhostile to him afterwards. This most likely indicates Dan has moved on for the most part, though he brings up his father's death occasionally to Sagat in a less demanding way.Adon  Adon became\u00a0Sagat's student three years after Sagat became God of Muay Thai. After Sagat was defeated by Ryu, Adon became mad at his former teacher for being unable to uphold Muay Thai's honor (conveniently forgetting how Ryu had bested him during the World Warrior tournament), scorning him as \"a tiger who has lost his fangs\". Sagat himself finds the fact that Adon was once his student \"a source of great shame\".M. Bison and Shadaloo  Originally, Sagat was one of Bison's top enforcers, but left and excommunicated himself from Shadaloo and its activities after Bison attempted to take advantage of his rivalry with Ryu by corrupting the latter with Psycho Power.Story Background  Since a young age, Sagat had an affinity for fighting, but constant brawls on the streets as a child left his right eye with significant injuries that soon made it a weak point. Realizing that learning on the streets was not the way for him to learn fighting, he soon took up the martial art of Muay Thai to discipline himself and grow strong. As he grew up and picked himself back up from a struggle of defeats in his early career, his size eventually became his advantage, and by the age of 15 he was able to fight his way to the top as a worthy champion in the world of Muay Thai. Sagat gained his title of \"The Emperor of Muay Thai\" after defeating Nuakan, a powerful fighter that was also considered an emperor of Muay Thai. Adon witnessed their battle and asked Sagat to take him as his student. Sometime after this, Sagat was challenged by a nameless masked man who refused to give out his name upon confrontation, who was none other than Go Hibiki. Sagat attempted to fight on an even level, but Go noticed Sagat's weak right eye and proceeded to direct all attacks at it. When one of his attacks landed and gouged out Sagat's right eye, Sagat retaliated in anger with countering an oncoming clincher knee kick with a new attack that summoned a great power deep within him, and obliterated Go: the Tiger Shot.Street Fighter  Sagat trained Adon, and held the first World Warrior Tournament to prove that he was not only the strongest Muay Thai fighter, but the strongest fighter in the world. Only one fighter managed to reach Sagat: a young martial artist named Ryu. Initially, Sagat was able to pin Ryu, and was sure that he was the winner of the match, even going to help Ryu up. However, Ryu became desperate to win the fight and was accidentally corrupted by the Satsui no Hado and his dark side and executed the Metsu Shoryuken, grievously wounding Sagat and leaving a massive scar across his chest. Sagat swore revenge on Ryu. While it wasn't revealed at the time, when Ryu scarred Sagat, some of his Hado passed to Sagat.Street Fighter Alpha  In the retconned events of Street Fighter Alpha, Sagat enters the tournament to exact his revenge on Ryu, and succeeds. Although pleased that he got his revenge, he somewhat felt empty after the fight. Sagat realized that Ryu didn't give it his all, and he believes Ryu held back. Sagat eventually gave up this vendetta, considering it to be foolish and pointless. However, Bison's plane arrives at the scene. Bison comments that Sagat had succeeded in defeating Ryu, but suggests that he must master the Psycho Power if he is to be feared.Street Fighter Alpha 2  Sagat dedicated himself to learning a move to rival the one that scarred him, and developed the Tiger Blow. At a later point, Adon mocks his teacher for losing to Ryu and challenged him for the title of God of Muay Thai. Sagat had not recovered from his chest being ripped open, and lost to Adon, but not before beating the younger man so hard that he would be in traction for four months. Consumed with rage and hatred, Sagat eagerly joined the criminal organization known as Shadaloo; M. Bison had offered him Shadaloo resources to find Ryu and provide Sagat with a rematch. Sagat's nearly indomitable power provided him with the position of Bison's personal bodyguard, one of the feared \"Four Heavenly Kings\" of Shadaloo. He then immediately set about tracking Ryu down. Sagat soon caught up to Ryu and challenged him to a fight, with Ryu protesting that Sagat had not fully recovered from their last one. Sagat persisted, and won. Afterwards, he couldn't help but feel that the victory was hollow somehow, and realized that Ryu had let him win; after the match, Ryu had not said a word, and merely gave him a mysterious look. Sagat determined to train even harder and win cleanly the next time. He worked on honing the Tiger Blow, which would later be perfected as the Tiger Uppercut in his ending. Sagat also encountered Dan Hibiki, now an adult seeking revenge for his father's death in the fight with Sagat ten years previously. Sagat, his thoughts still lingering on how Ryu had let him win in their last match, felt a sort of kinship with Dan during the match, and he purposely threw the fight, which allowed Dan to satisfy his anger (although he doesn't know that Sagat deliberately did so).Street Fighter Alpha 3  Sagat realized that his scar was a result of the Satsui no Hado, which possessed Ryu. He understood that true rivals should not be blinded by rage and hatred, nor be seduced by it, and realized Bison's true intentions. However, Bison presented him with a brainwashed Ryu, and told Sagat he could have the rematch he always wanted. Despite his disappointment at fighting a corrupted opponent, Sagat still fought Ryu, but sought to break Bison's mind control. He implored to Ryu that a true warrior would not give in to such treachery. Ryu awakened from Bison's control and, rejecting the Satsui no Hado, defeated and drove away Bison temporarily. Sagat finally realized that rivalries must have their limits. Sagat tells Ryu that he was almost destroyed by the corruption, and is not yet ready to take him on again. Ryu then leaves Sagat, promising to return when he becomes a true master. Sagat realizes that he must defeat Ryu not for revenge, but for his destiny.Super Street Fighter II  While Sagat's goal in the second World Warrior Tournament was a clean rematch with Ryu, his hopes were eclipsed when Ryu was knocked out of the competition; therefore, he dropped out before his next match, finishing third in the tournament. Afterwards, he resigned from his Shadaloo post. Sagat continued to train his body and mind in Thailand, hoping to become the world's strongest fighter once again before he became too old to do so.Super Street Fighter IV  After the second World Warrior Tournament, Sagat lapses into a depression, \"feeling like a loser\". Attending one of Adon's matches in search of \"something to reignite [his] spirit\", he is mocked and challenged to a match by his former pupil. Defeating Adon with his Tiger Destruction as he is cheered on by the fans, Sagat feels reinvigorated, and then enters S.I.N.'s new tournament in the hopes of a rematch with Ryu and discovering the \"ultimate purpose of the fight\". He eventually finds Ryu and battles him. The outcome of the battle is currently unknown. After the tournament, Sagat reflects on his obsession with Ryu, realizing that instead of focusing on victory or defeat, what's truly important is communicating one's soul to the opponent through one's fists. Sagat compares his former self to Seth, whose fists Sagat says were \"mute\", and wonders whether he has changed now. In his ending, as he returns home to his village, he is greeted by Chit, his sister, and a monk (characters who all appear in the second volume of Masahiko Nakahira's Ryu Final manga) who ask how the tournament went. Sagat replies that he \"actually had fun\" because he \"met an old friend\" (presumably Ryu). Meanwhile, Adon watches him as he leaves, vowing to dethrone him and become the new God of Muay Thai. In a recent patch, Sagat has been added to Street Fighter IV for the iPod Touch and iPhone.Street Fighter V series  Before his DLC annoucement, Sagat didn't make a physical appearance in Street Fighter V, the likely reason being to maintain character balance at the time. In Rashid's character story, among the many fighters using social media was Abel, whom stated that he found Sagat hidden deep in the mountains. He questions why the former Shadoloo king was at his present location. In the Lair of the Four Kings stage, F.A.N.G's statue is replaced with one of Sagat in the former's character story fight with M. Bison since it takes place at a time when Sagat had not yet been replaced within Shadaloo. Sagat becomes a playable DLC character in August 6th, alongside G. Sagat has a pet tiger named Willa Maiu (\u30a6\u30a4\u30e9\u30e1\u30fc\u30a6, Uira M\u0113u), whose full name is Phicit Willa Maiu (\u30d4\u30c1\u30c3\u30c8\u30fb\u30a6\u30a4\u30e9\u30fb\u30e1\u30fc\u30a6, Pichitto Uira M\u0113u), meaning \"victorious courageous cat\" in Thai. Sagat found him when he was just a cub, naming him \"Maiu\", simply meaning \"cat\", but as he developed into a fully-grown tiger, calling him \"cat\" didn't feel right, so the children of the village gave him his full name. In his character story, Sagat was training as usual when he is tormented by the Satsui no Hado. Seeing Namupun, in a demonic visage, instilling him to \"kill them\" (possibly refering to other fighters), Sagat manages to overcome this power and his desire to kill by unknowingly tapping into the Power of Nothingness. Then he starts to fight against the evil energy, seeking the same path as Ryu.Crossover appearances Capcom vs. SNK series  Sagat appeared as a playable character in Capcom vs. SNK: Millennium Fight 2000, Mark of the Millennium 2001/EO\u00a0and SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos.Street Fighter X Tekken  Whilst training by a waterfall, Sagat is informed by a villager that the young girl he once saved has gone missing. Listening to the brother of the girl's pleas for help, Dhalsim appears before him and asks a favor of him, telling him of missing children from his own village. The two decide to team up and search for Pandora, believing the power within it may help them find the missing children. Eventually reaching the Antarctic, the two find the missing children, and Pandora opens before them. Dhalsim tells Sagat that Pandora \"is said to be a power to rival the Gods\". Sagat decides that \"A King has no need\" for the box, and the two walk off into the distance, with Pandora closing behind them.Street Fighter \u00d7 Mega Man  Sagat is one of two hidden bosses in Street Fighter \u00d7 Mega Man. He was added in the Version 2 release.Comics Street Fighter Alpha manga  His battle with Ryu is shown in a flashback, where he mocks Ryu for not taking advantage of his weakness. Just as he is about to emerge victorious, Ryu taps into the Satsui no Hadou and scars him. His defeat led to Adon joining Shadaloo to get revenge for \"insulting Muay Thai\" with his defeat. He is last seen about to have his rematch with Ryu.Street Fighter III: Ryu Final  In the Ryu Final manga, flashbacks of Sagat coping with his loss to Ryu are shown. He is distraught due to his loss, and is shown rampaging in grief. Sagat becomes a lost soul, but after protecting two orphans from poachers, he finds new meaning in his life. He is shown to be a hermit in Thailand during the present time, and is often visited by the orphan siblings and a monk he befriended. He is first shown fighting Hugo, who arrogantly claims that he would win, since Ryu (who is famous for beating Sagat) fought him to a draw. Sagat berates him for his ignorance and easily defeats him. Right before his match with Akuma, Ryu seeks Sagat out in order to have a rematch. A fierce battle commences, and though Ryu is the first to be knocked down, Sagat's chest scars reopens as well. Sagat thanks Ryu for the good fight, and tells him to be ready, as he is tired of waiting and will seek Ryu out next time.UDON comics  A younger Sagat is shown during the Chun-Li miniseries as the main antagonist. In this series, he is portrayed as far more evil and ruthless than even his earlier incarnations, serving as Bison's enforcer in secretly stealing priceless artifacts. His portrayal in all other series is a mix of his various incarnations: Though he chooses to remain a member of Shadaloo unlike his Alpha incarnation, he remains honorable. While he wants his rematch with Ryu, he disapproves of his organization's methods, and warns Ryu about Shadaloo. After his loss to Ryu, he began training with Dhalsim and became much more powerful, even shocking Ryu with his new strength and recommending that he should train with the Yoga master as well.\u00a0 During the Street Fighter tournament, he served as the host for the Chinese branch of the preliminary matches, and allows Fei-Long and Chun-Li to enter if they can defeat all the martial artists who passed the preliminaries.\u00a0Near the end of the series, he finally has his much awaited rematch with Ryu, and though he lost, they parted on good terms. He is last seen leaving Shadoloo and training to improve himself ever further.Street Fighter vs. Darkstalkers  In Street Fighter vs. Darkstalkers, he reappears and allies with Felicia, Ken and Chun-Li to fight the monsters that appear.Animations and movies Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie  In SFII: The Animated Movie, Sagat is shown as part of Shadaloo (or Shadow Law, as it is called in the movie) and as one of its main enforcers, along with Vega and Balrog. He is first seen in the infamous fight with Ryu, in which he receives his scar, an event that makes him go berserk and run right into a Hadouken, and lose the match. Later on, he is belittled by Bison for losing, and his rematch with Ryu is denied by the leader of Shadow Law, who instead sends him to fetch Cammy and Vega. After their failures, they are to be eliminated. It is unknown if Sagat completed this mission or not.USA cartoon  Viktor Sagat appears as an ally to M. Bison in the show. For most of the cartoon, his rivalry with Ryu isn't present, however, in the last episodes, a flashback is shown where Ryu scars him with a Shoryuken, before they fight, with Ryu winning. He later joins Guile to take down Shadaloo on the last episode after he finds out M. Bison's plans to take over the world.Street Fighter II V  Sagat appears in episodes 8-10 of Street Fighter II V with both eyes and no scar. He also has no connection to Shadoloo, instead being a former Muay Thai champion who refused to allow his fights to be fixed at the behest of the Ashura crime syndicate. To punish him, Ashura had him framed as a dealer in drugs and imprisoned. He encounters Ryu when Donu, an Ashura agent, pulls a similar trick to get Ryu sent to the prison where Sagat is held. After an initial fight, Sagat recognizes Ryu as a kindred fighting spirit and the two become friends, defending each other against the abusive prison warden Nuchi. After Ryu and Ken defeat Ashura, they are able to present evidence that gets Sagat released from prison, and in gratitude, Sagat tells them to go to India in search of Dhalsim if they wish to master the secrets of Hadou.Wreck-it Ralph  Sagat made a small cameo in Disney's Wreck-it Ralph as one of the portraits in Tapper's.Live-action Street Fighter: The Movie  In the live action movie, Victor Sagat (listed as \"Viktor Sagat\" in the movie's action figure line) is depicted as an underground mob boss in Shadaloo City, and the bodyguard for the insane dictator General Bison. In contrast to his rivalry with Ryu in the games, Sagat was depicted as Ken's rival instead. Sagat was once a cage fighter named Iron Fist; he retired to head the Shadaloo Tong, which controlled the city's criminal operations. Ryu and Ken (a couple of con artists) attempt to sell him fake guns, but Sagat uncovers the plot and orders them killed. Ryu and Ken manage to beat Sagat's men to a pulp, until they are stopped by Sagat's gun-wielding bodyguards. Impressed, Sagat plans for Ryu and Ken to be the next opponents of his cage-fighting champion and best friend, Vega. But just before Ryu and Vega can fight, Colonel Guile crashes into the arena with his tank and arrests them all, including Sagat, Vega, Ryu and Ken, taking them to the AN (Allied Nations) headquarters. In prison, Sagat once again orders Ryu and Ken beaten up by his men, but Ryu and Ken hold them off for a good while until Guile, Cammy and T. Hawk spot them, deciding to recruit them as allies to the AN. Guile outlines a plan with Ryu and Ken to \"escape\" from prison and \"kill\" him in the process, while carrying a homing device which Guile and the AN will use to track Sagat to Bison's lair. The plan goes well, and Sagat accepts Ryu and Ken as his allies, unaware that they are actually spying on him. Sagat and his men all flee to the AN headquarters and seek refuge with Bison at the black market, where they all watch a magic show by the Benbelli Brothers (in reality Chun-Li, Balrog and Honda, all bent on revenge). Here, Sagat shows Bison a sample of the weapons he will be supplying him with, and the crafty Bison attempts to pay him with a trunk of Bison Dollars which he will establish after taking the Earth over. An enraged Sagat refuses, and calls Bison a raving lunatic, prompting them to terminate their partnership until Ryu and Ken (in a desperate attempt to get the homing device to Bison's fortress and call Guile) inform them of a lorry (filled with explosives by Chun-Li, Balrog and Honda) heading straight for them. Allied once again, Bison, Sagat, Vega, Ryu, Ken and the two armies flee the tent just before the explosion. Sagat and his men then go with Bison to the hidden base, where they are \"welcome to stay\". Sagat is also present at Bison's attempt to blow Guile's stealth boat up with mines, where he is horrified to see Guile alive; Bison refers to his eyepatch as the cause of his not knowing of Ryu and Ken's escape plan with Guile. Sagat also witnessed the execution of the fifty-three relief workers Bison had taken hostage. After Guile and his army finally arrive just before the execution, Sagat and Vega deduce Ryu and Ken to have led them there, and plan to ambush and kill them in revenge. Sagat and Vega corner Ryu in the locker room and start to beat him up, until Ryu knocks Vega aside and Sagat himself is punched aside by Ken, who found Ryu after getting separated from him. Ken and Sagat then fight their own battle in the base's gym while Ryu and Vega fight. At first, Sagat appears to have the upper hand, until Ken manages to use some of the gym equipment to hurt Sagat and finally score a knockout, hitting Sagat into a nearby wall. But just before leaving with Ryu, who knocked Vega out, Ken gives Sagat a golden figurine he had stolen as a sarcastic \"thank-you\" present, quipping that had Ken not met Sagat and seen how evil he was, he might have ended up becoming a monster like him. With the base collapsing, Sagat abandons Vega and escapes with Dee Jay through a secret passage to avoid being arrested by the AN. They make it out just before the explosion, and swim through a river to shore with a trunk full of Bison's money, only to find it filled with the now-useless Bison Dollars.Street Fighter: Assassin's Fist  Sagat himself doesn't appear in the Street Fighter: Assassin's Fist series but he is mentioned in a deleted scene as the killer of Dan's father.Other appearances Street Fighter EX series Background  After losing his championship title in the first official Street Fighter tournament, Sagat was devastated. He was at a loss to explain how his victory was stolen away from him by an incomprehensible attack by the young fighter he was about to beat. Seeing that Sagat was saddened and dismayed, M. Bison chose that opportunity to recruit Sagat into the Shadowloo army so he could use his anger and rage to shape incoming soldiers. Sagat accepted the position to fill a void of purpose in his life, but he never stopped thinking about that small fighter who managed to knock him out by ripping his chest apart with an abnormally powerful strike. Sagat wished to know Ryu's secret of how he tapped into such power. Sagat wanted that power for himself. He trained night and day mercilessly with his students, perfecting new techniques and honing his power. He waited for the day when he would have a chance to challenge Ryu to a rematch. Sagat was forbidden by M. Bison from competing in the first EX tournament that Bison hosted. Bison needed Sagat in another part of the world for an operation. When Sagat discovered that a second EX tournament was being held, he would not be refused. He alerted Bison to the tournaments existence, which Bison was bitterly upset about. Sagat pleaded for a chance to fight Ryu, but Bison disregarded Sagat's concerns and sent Vega and Cracker Jack ahead to investigate. When Bison set off to visit the tournament personally, Sagat insisted on coming along, and Bison finally gave in, tired of listening to the giant's begging. Sagat prepared mentally for the challenge ahead of him. Sagat ripped through many of his opponents without a second thought, focused only on the moment when he would fight Ryu. That moment finally came. Ryu and Sagat squared off once more. Ryu was very sure to keep the power of Satsui no Hado in check, vowing never to allow the murderous intent to cloud his mind again. They both fought for a long time, and ultimate Sagat prevailed. By refusing to tap into that dark force, Ryu simply could not muster up the strength needed to topple the kickboxing champion. Having proven to himself what he knew all along, Sagat's victory over Ryu felt hollow. Although he defeated Ryu, the scar on his chest would always remind him of stolen victory. He entered the third tournament to prove to everyone that he was a champion once more.Endings Street Fighter EX2 Plus  ...It seems that same words kept resounding in his mind.\n\"Those stronger than myself...must be defeated!\"\nHe moves forward while believing in himself.\nJust like a true a emperor.Street Fighter EX3  No one knows what is on the mind of the great Emperor Sagat. Now that he is at the height of its power, he is ready to enter the lair of the gods. He thinks about how he will challenge and defeat all who stand in his way of beoming the greatest warrior of all-time. He raises his fist to the calm and quiet sky and screams, \"I surely will...\"Street Fighter EX3 (in team with Ryu)  As Sagat levaes the battlegrounds, he notices that there is no rage or resentment in his fists for his sworn enemy. Does he finally understand what it means to be a warrior? His old wound will not ache anymore. He raises his fist to the sky and screams for he is no longer an emperor, he is now a god of martial arts...Gameplay Fighting style  Sagat fights using Muay Thai, with a heavy focus on his big frame that gives him solid kicks with notable physical range.Moveset  Sagat's overall style plays similarly to Ken and Ryu, with some notable differences. Sagat focuses on his great offensive game, which allows him to effectively do a lot of damage, and he can punish and inflict knockdown with relative ease. However, his great height makes it easy to duck under certain attacks, and many of his moves are not very safe on whiff or block. In addition, his size also presents a much larger target, making efficient defense something of a difficult task for players. His size does have some advantages, as his long legs provide very good range, similar to Dhalsim's long range foot attacks; because of this, footsies are of little problem to achieve with him. Sagat's build gives his moves a longer range, allowing for ideal zoning and ground coverage, as well as approaching from afar. In Capcom vs. SNK 2, Sagat's normal attacks akin to the Alpha series, particularly his crouching fierce punch, have unusually high power and priority for solid pokes, making him one of the easiest characters to use effectively in that game. However, his aforementioned large size is exacerbated further by his somewhat low mobility, as via games such as the Alpha series and in Capcom vs. SNK, Sagat is known for his slightly below-average walk (and/or running) speed, and his low horizontal aerial coverage which leads to more acute jumping arcs; this overall further hampers his ability to effectively position himself movement-wise. However on the flipside, said jumping arcs when Sagat is up-close can lead to some fairly ambiguous angles of cross-up compared to more obtuse-to-normal jumping arcs. Sagat as a result, is a character that must focus on being able to properly condition his opponent at all ranges but comes with notable fundamental rewards for doing so. In Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold, there is a alternate version of Sagat that plays like his Super Street Fighter II counterpart.Techniques  Sagat's Muay Thai focuses on crushing, hard-hitting blows. He is known for his Tiger Shot, which gained a low-aiming variant in the Street Fighter II series. Sagat also uses the Tiger Uppercut (known as the multi-hit Tiger Blow in the Alpha series), an anti-air similar to Ken and Ryu's Shoryuken; throughout his appearances, the move has become a single-hit attack with increased priority. He possesses the Tiger Knee as well, which works as an approach and a longer-distance punish. In Capcom vs. SNK 2, Sagat's scar glows while he charges energy for his S-Groove super meter. Later games introduce this concept in the form of the Angry Charge, which powers up his next Tiger Uppercut. This technique is also his V-Skill in Street Fighter V. In Street Fighter V he retains all of his moves from the previous games and gained more Muay Thai moves. His first V-Trigger is the Tiger Charge, originally one of his unique taunts in the Alpha series. While in that state, Sagat's special attacks can hit his opponent multiple times resembling his Super Combos. His second V-Trigger is Tiger Assault where Sagat's Tiger Knee gains additional damage and his kicks are now embedded with fire.Super Combos  Sagat's first Super Combo is the Tiger Genocide, introduced in the Street Fighter II series; it is a Tiger Knee followed by a Tiger Uppercut. The move has remained his most frequent Super Combo in all of his appearances. The Street Fighter Alpha games introduced two other Super Combos: the Tiger Raid is a barrage of leg and knee blows followed by a flying side kick, and the Tiger Cannon is a supercharged Tiger Shot that hits multiple times; in some games, Sagat can even throw the projectile high or low. In the Street Fighter IV series, the Tiger Genocide returns as Sagat's Super Combo; a more powerful version, the Tiger Destruction, acts as his first Ultra Combo; if landed successfully, Sagat adds a spinning, multi-hitting uppercut imbued with flames. The Tiger Cannon returns as Sagat's second Ultra Combo. In Street Fighter V, his Critical Art is the Tiger Rampage where Sagat knee his opponent followed by three kicks and a spike as the last blow knocks the opponent with a powerful Tiger Uppercut.Controversy  In Street Fighter II, producing an array of alternating high and low fireball attacks can confuse and greatly damage an opponent, to the point where his \"Old Sagat\" incarnation is soft banned in Japan's SSFIIT tournaments; his fireballs combined with the occasional Tiger Uppercut make him overly effective and easy to use. This technique is less viable in later games where projectiles do less damage, or can otherwise be avoided. The soft ban, while violated more frequently than the Akuma ban, has allowed a larger cast of characters to flourish. Additionally, while he is not considered as broken as Akuma, his presence in American tournaments has seen certain characters completely ignored, due to their almost un-winnable match-ups against Sagat.Pop Culture  Sagat/Pop CultureTrivia Quotes  See: Sagat/QuotesSee also References Juri  Juri Han (\u30cf\u30f3\u30fb\u30b8\u30e5\u30ea, Han Juri, Hangul: \ud55c\uc8fc\ub9ac, Hanja: \u97d3\u86db\u4fd0) is a video game character from the Street Fighter series, first appearing in Super Street Fighter IV. She is a brutal South Korean Taekwondo martial artist who derives pleasure from inflicting pain on others.Biography Appearance  Juri wears a purple dudou (a form of Chinese bra top) on her chest supported with eight straps that meet on her back, forming a spider pattern. She wears long, baggy, off-white colored sweat pants and purple tights, and long, fingerless gloves. Her fingernails and toenails are painted bright pink. She has dark hair styled into two horn-like bangs at the top of her head, which appear to be fastened with pink ribbons. She wears Taekwondo foot wraps on her feet. Her left eye was damaged long ago (explained below) and replaced with the Feng Shui Engine which amplifies her abilities. In Street Fighter V, she is wearing a purple and pink collared catsuit with a spider-shaped pattern in the back, with a black high-neck sleeveless top underneath, black fingerless gloves with pink designs, the pants from her catsuit have black inlines with dark purple and pink. She also has a black eyepatch with a magenta pattern on her left eye. Her first alternate costume is a blue-green winter jacket, pink and white pants, black knee-high boots, and matching gloves. She doesn't wear her eye patch in this costume, as her story mode appearance in this outfit occurs before Bison ripped out the Feng Shui Engine. Her second costume is somewhat similar to her primary outfit in Super Street Fighter IV, her dudou is white, her trousers are black with pink and white outlines and wears matching black taekwondo ankle wraps on her feet, her hair is down and her bangs are dyed pink.Personality  Juri fights purely for the thrill of the battle; unlike Ryu, who seeks meaning, her drive is much more vengeful, selfish and ruthless, as she's extremely sadistic, liking to inflict pain on her foes, and she's also extremely hot-tempered, as she can easily lose her temper when she is struck back in retaliation without warning. Juri loves combat to the point where she becomes irritated when it is denied to her like when Rashid refused to fight her seriously Juri said \"he could just die\" if that was the case. She displays several traits of a femme fatale, as she makes provocative and suggestive remarks toward her enemies, as well seen in her win quotes; she is also very cunning, as she is not above leaving her partners to further her own agenda. At times, she appears to be brooding and depressed, Menat claimed she felt a sense of \"loneliness\" from Juri implying all her wiles and cruelty is just a cover for how broken she is on the inside. However, despite her vengeful and ruthless behavior, she still has some vague sense of honor; during her mission (in the Super Street Fighter IV OVA), she left a young boy alive despite many civilians being caught in the crossfire. Juri also appears to detest fighting children, and views Evil Ryu to be a far more abhorrent type of ruthlessness, which somewhat contradicts her opinion on other Ansatsuken users. Juri is also slightly hypocritical, she mocks the suffering of Cammy and Decapre at the hands of Bison despite having gone though similar pain in her childhood. Juri also call Vega a \"pervert\" despite her also taking sexual delight in hurting othersConcept  Super Street Fighter IV's development team was instructed to make a female Korean character in response to many Korean fans who wished for Capcom to add a Korean character in Street Fighter - something already established by SNK and Namco in their respective fighting game franchises. According to Capcom senior staff member Yoshinori Ono, the team had planned to include a Korean character since soon after Street Fighter II became popular in Korea but the Korean government had a strict limitation against the Japanese language and culture, preventing them from including such a character. However, other competitors' fighting games (released some time shortly after Street Fighter II), such as SNK's Fatal Fury and Namco's Tekken, have had Korean characters, so it is unclear if this excuse is accurate. The designers toyed with many different ideas, totaling between 400 and 500 variations of the character's appearance; there were hundreds of concept designs for Juri, including an overweight version and one that used mixed martial arts. Design Director Kami said regarding Juri: \"From the start, we felt like, 'let's make her an evil, sexy character'.\" The creators decided to give Juri a strong, unusual personality to make her a character which people will either love or hate. Juri was designed to be a member of S.I.N. in order to associate her with the Street Fighter IV characters; thus, the Feng Shui Engine was created to give her a strong connection with S.I.N. The creators thought about putting the engine in her abdomen (like Seth's Tanden Engine), but as this looked unattractive, they ended up putting it in her eye. An idea early in development was to have her in a tragic love story, caught up with the wrong people. However, once this was put to Yoshinori Ono, he responded: \"No way, that's no good, she can't be a good girl. Surprise everyone and make her a really evil chick.\" They also chose to make a spider Juri's trademark, explaining the spider-web design on her top and her nickname, Spider. Her behavior and personality are also typically likened to that of a female \"spider\", as many species are known in particular for eating their mates. Taekwondo had not been used by any character in the Street Fighter series before, so they decided that it would be a great chance to make Juri a practitioner. Juri's outfit was designed specifically so that her silhouette would look like a traditional Taekwondo outfit, but they gave her bright colors and unique designs to differentiate her from the rest of the cast. Juri can be interpreted as a \"dark mirror image\" of Chun-Li. Both had their parent(s) killed by M. Bison and, subsequently, swore a vendetta against him. The main difference is that Chun-Li maintains a strong sense of justice even while seeking to punish the Dictator, whereas Juri is willing to hurt anybody and everybody who gets in the way of her quest for revenge. Notably, another character designed after Chun-Li in Capcom's works holds greater similarities to Juri, being that of the character June Lin Milliam of Star Gladiator, whose vendetta was more rooted in vengeance and retribution out of bereavement out of the death of both parents and whose character is themed with a butterfly motif. It should also be noted that aspects of Juri's design, such as her hair and chestwear, seem to resemble Jolyne Kujo from the manga/anime series JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. In addition, Juri has a spider motif and cleaves a butterfly in her official artwork; Jolyne has a butterfly motif (and clothes with a spider-web pattern) and her Stand turns her body into threads and webs. Juri even has the same \"ora ora ora\" battle cry as Jolyne and other members of her family when using Fuharenjin. Coincidentally, Jolyne's voice actress in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure All-Star Battle\u00a0and Eyes of Heaven (licensed games developed by CyberConnect2 and distributed by Bandai Namco Entertainment), Miyuki Sawashiro, also voices Cammy\u00a0in Street Fighter IV and V. Eri Kitamura, Juri's Japanese voice actress, also voices Yasuho Hirose in the same games.Character interactions Chun-Li  Juri and Chun-Li have a strong rivalry. Chun-Li has tried to arrest Juri at least twice, including when Juri captures and brutalizes the Dolls, despite originally expressing disdain at having to fight women. Unlike Chun-Li's hatred for her and all criminals, Juri does not seem to hate Chun-Li as much as she does enjoy toying and mocking her, even suggesting at some point that Chun-Li has a \"schoolgirl crush\" on her. In Project X Zone, Chun-Li sees that Juri still has some good in her. After that, Juri would accept the offer to join the other heroes to save the universe.Cammy  Juri and Cammy have a mutual contempt for each other. Cammy bears a grudge against Juri for what she did to her \"sisters\", the Dolls, while Juri claims that Cammy is sinful because of what she did in the past, before she lost her memory. During the story mode in Street Fighter V, Juri saves Cammy and Decapre from the police and earns the former's thanks, though Cammy still hasn't forgiven her and warns not to hurt her \"sisters\" ever again. Juri is much less hostile, even fighting off Vega for her and helps Cammy and the Dolls in the final battle against Shadaloo. It is assumed she doesn't consider the dolls hostile anymore since the fall of Shadaloo.M. Bison  Juri hates M. Bison with a passion, as his organization was responsible for the murder of her parents and the loss of her left eye, and she constantly plots to destroy him. Conversely, M. Bison regards Juri as he does many of his usurping 'pawns', if not most of his foes in general: a minor nuisance at worst. In spite of this, Juri and Bison are shown about to engage in another fight in M. Bison's ending, after Juri threatens that Bison should be less worried about where her special eye came from, and more about what she is about to do to him with it. Her contempt for Shadaloo and Bison would make her go as far as willingly work for the Illuminati in Street Fighter V under Helen (a facade of Kolin) and Urien.Rashid  Juri met Rashid thanks to Helen bringing him and Charlie to the Illuminati meeting, Juri immediately challenged Rashid to a fight, but Rashid had no interest in fighting her. Disappointed, Juri stated if he didn't take her seriously she'd have to kill him but Helen stopped them before the situation became serious.Ryu  While they have little interaction, Juri is especially impressed by Ryu's strength and power, and very much enjoys fighting the Ansatsuken style and even berates Ryu for trying to find a purpose in fighting, saying he should live for the pleasure of it. Upon fighting Evil Ryu, Juri gets \"overly excited\" saying if Ryu keeps glaring at her like that, she'll start getting \"frisky\". Despite this, Juri dislikes Satsui no Hado, saying it's too abhorrent even for her.Kolin  During Street Fighter V, Helen and Juri seem to have a somewhat professional relationship since they had a common enemy to take down, M. Bison as well as Shadaloo.Seth  Juri sees Seth as a pawn in her attempt to get revenge for the murder of her parents, despite the perverse joy she displays in working for him and brutally dealing with the enemies of S.I.N. Seth is well aware of this as shown in his ending.Vega  Juri sees Vega as a \"pervert\" due to his obsession with beauty, though this is quite hypocritical given her own interactions with other male fighters. Vega on the other hand appears to feel genuinely attracted to Juri's beauty and psychopathic tendencies, calling her the \"personification of evil beauty itself\" in his SSFIV win quote against her, though he dislikes her provocations, saying that she lacks \"delicacy\".Story Early History  At the age of 15, Juri was the preeminent practitioner of Tae Kwon Do. Her father was a lawyer in charge of prosecuting organized crime operations. When he started targeting Shadaloo, her family was kidnapped by the organization. During the ordeal, Juri lost her parents and her left eye was gravely wounded. She undergoes an operation at the S.I.N. laboratory to have the Feng Shui Engine implanted into that eye. The people operating on her note her calmness during the implanting. Juri assassinates operatives in a public area as her first mission in order to test out the Feng Shui Engine. Even with guns, her enemies stand no chance against her, taking them out one by one from behind. Chun-Li was called to the scene to stop the massacre. Chun-Li rushes into the scene to arrest Juri, and arrives just as Juri killed the gunmen using her Feng Shui Engine from the inside of a building. A woman dies in the attack from collateral damage. Juri and Chun-Li battle, ending with Juri unleashing her eye's power and knocking out Chun-Li. As her victim lays on the ground, Juri prepares to deal the finishing blow. However, her Feng Shui Engine malfunctions, forcing her to flee back to the lab. After getting it fixed, Seth assigns Juri her next mission: capturing M. Bison's elite female assassins, the Dolls. Juri flies to the base of the Dolls with several S.I.N. employees. She manages to defeat every single assassin in combat, including Juli and Juni. As she carries the two unconscious assassins away to an S.I.N. plane, Cammy and Guile arrive. They have a heated fight, but Juri comes out on top and manages to incapacitate Guile. She boards her plane and straps Juni and Juli to beds with wheels. As it takes off, Cammy manages to jump and grab onto the open boarding ramp, and confronts Juri for one final time. After an intense conflict, Juri pushes one of the rolling tables (with Juni on it) which collides with Cammy, who both fall off the boarding ramp into mid-air. They survive the fall, with snow breaking their fall.Super Street Fighter IV  During the global tournament hosted by Seth, he sends Juri in to participate; she sees it as a perfect opportunity for some 'fun.' During the tournament, Juri is confronted by Cammy and Chun-Li again; the results of the fights are unknown. Juri continues to tend to her hidden agenda. In her ending, she approaches Seth, who was incapacitated as a result of Bison's brutal beating, and taunts him for \"being nothing more than Bison's spare body.\" Before she is to dispose of him, she reveals that she was to serve S.I.N. for as long as it suited her purposes, since she was merely trying to pit Seth and Bison against each other - a task Seth obviously was not up to. Juri viciously crushes Seth's Tanden Engine by stomping on it, and leaves him for dead.Street Fighter V  On October 2015, a datamining of Street Fighter V's PC beta test revealed fighter data and character meshes of Juri, Dhalsim, Ibuki, Alex, Urien, Guile and Balrog. Juri and the rest of the characters (except for Dhalsim who was confirmed earlier as a default fighter) were later confirmed on December 5th, 2015 at the PlayStation Experience.Character story  Shortly after the fall of S.I.N., Juri faces off against Bison again to avenge her family. However, Bison quickly gets behind her, attacks her with Psycho Power and grabs her head. He rips out her Feng Shui Engine and leaves her for dead. She goes into an abandoned S.I.N. laboratory and finds another eye, the Feng Shui Engine Alpha. Juri meets up with Kolin (under the disguise as Helen). Kolin offers Juri the ability to join her, when they are interrupted by Balrog, who's looking around for S.I.N. agents. Wanting to test out her new eye, Juri fights him, before Ed tells him that they have to get back to base to discuss a plan. Juri later meets C. Viper, who informs her that the only reason she's not in jail is because she is not the primary threat and warns her about Shadaloo's motives. Later at the Shadaloo base, looking around for data on Shadaloo, Juri confronts F.A.N.G., who becomes insulted by her remarks on being Bison's second in command. Their fight ends with F.A.N.G using his poison clouds to make Juri retreat. Juri now realizing their motives, calls Helen by phone and finally accepts her offer to take down Shadaloo.A Shadow Falls  When Rashid and Azam meet Charlie Nash and Helen, Juri arrives by kicking open the door. She eyes the other people in her team and decides to fight Rashid, which he is reluctant about. Juri overwhelms him and he tells her to stop fighting. Juri threatens to kill him if he won't fight her seriously, at which point Azam steps in to defend Rashid. Helen breaks up the conflict and explains the danger of the Black Moons and presents a plan to stop Shadaloo. Juri shows interest in the plan and joins. In Brazil, When Cammy defends Decapre by assaulting police officers, Juri arrives by motorbike and rams an officer. She picks up Cammy and Decapre, finding the situation amusing. Juri later watches with amusement as Cammy and Decapre (who is under the influence of the Psycho Power) fight before Cammy knocks Decapre out. When Vega arrives and defeats Cammy, Juri intervenes, calling Vega a pervert and mocks him. She fights him off and Vega decides to leave temporarily. She brings Cammy back to Russia with her team as they plan their final attack on Shadaloo. During the final assault on Shadaloo, Juri and Decapre arrive to take on Shadaloo's soldiers. Decapre saves Cammy from Vega's claw. They team up to fight the other Dolls, who are still under the influence of the Psycho Power, who are controlled by F.A.N.G.Other character story appearances  Juri appears at the end of Cammy's character story. She is shown to be listening in on a conversation between Cammy and Juni, as Cammy swears to free the other dolls no matter the cost. Juri then comments on how \"things are getting interesting\". In Guile's prologue story, Juri is spotted by Guile and Abel at the abandoned S.I.N. Laboratory, taunting them and stating that they should see what Shadaloo is up to before leaving.Crossover appearances Street Fighter X Tekken  Juri is a playable character in Street Fighter X Tekken. In the fifth CG trailer, she is seen defeating Ling Xiaoyu during Bison's raid on Mishima Zaibatsu. Juri kicks Xiaoyu into Jin Kazama's\u00a0office, where Jin is fighting off Bison. Seeing Xiaoyu being beaten down causes Jin to give in to the power of the Devil Gene, and he quickly grabs Juri by her head, but hesitates to finish her off as he is trying to regain control of his body.\u00a0Juri takes the opportunity to activate her Feng Shui Engine and kick Jin away, and Bison intervenes and strikes Jin down, using his trademark Psycho Crusher to finish him off. However, Jin is finally transformed by his Devil Gene as both stare at him, intimidated by his power. Juri and Bison's ending is similar\u00a0to that of fellow Shadaloo members Vega and Balrog. Bison begins harnessing Pandora and plans to take over the world. While he is seemingly distracted, Juri attempts to strike him down. Bison easily avoids her attack by teleporting above her, and tells her that he knew all along what she was up to, mocking her predictability. As the tension mounts, the power of Pandora awakens within them and the two begin charging at each other. The screen then fades to black. After defeating M. Bison, she falls under the evil influence of Pandora, and goes to fight in many tournaments around the world against other fighters, eventually getting the attention of many tournament hosts around the world to want her to fight for them.[citation needed] Juri's Swap Costume is Zafina's outfit from Tekken 6. Alisa's Swap Costume is a torn, altered version of Juri's costume.Project X Zone  In Namco's crossover RPG for the 3DS, Juri appears along with Seth, Alisa Boscovonitch and Dural as a rival unit, and later switches\u00a0to the hero side to become a solo unit along with Heihachi Mishima and Alisa after Seth planned to use her Feng Shui Engine for his plans of world conquest.Project X Zone 2  Juri also returns in the sequel, once again as a rival unit, this time apparently working for M. Bison. While it is not known whether or not working for Bison was her choice, she remains allied with Bison throughout the story, and thus never fights alongside the party.Comics UDON comics  Juri appears in UDON's Super Street Fighter: New Generations comics. As a teenager, she is not yet a capable Taekwando fighter and is being trained by her instructor during a sparing match. Her parents are present during her defeat and she is lectured by her mother for not showing much improvement. Her father is called by fellow prosecutors relating to the prosecution of Shadaloo and M. Bison. Juri had dinner with her parents where she learns of her father plans to prosecute members of Shadaloo, he tells her that this job is important and it is his duty to convict these criminals just as it is her duty not to let down the Han family. Juri feels pressured by her parents expectation of her during their dinner, she travels with her parents to see her father off at the airport; however, their car is suddenly attacked by Shadaloo at the request of Bison himself. A stray round caught Juri in the left eye and left her comatose for a month. Upon awakening, she found out that her mother was murdered by Shadaloo and her father was taken and ransomed by Bison, and later was murdered by him live on camera after his ransom was not paid by the South Korean government. Five months after the assassination of the Han\u00a0family, Juri fell into a deep depression and developed an immense hatred for Bison. While planning her revenge, she tells her master to teach her everything he knows. Her prowess in later years would catch the interest of Seth and S.I.N. During a mission for Seth, she brings back a necklace related to a company that has been hidden throughout the world for years, and a case; Seth tells her that the necklace belongs to the Secret Society. As he opens the case, he finds out that the Society has been following him by using a tracking device inside the case, and Bison and other members of the Society have come to reclaim what is rightfully theirs. When Seth was defeated, Juri was told that the Society's ruler wants her to join them. Seeing this as the perfect time to achieve her revenge against Bison, she agrees to his side of working for the Society in hopes of taking Bison out at the right time. As Guile, Alex, and Dan are out to stop the Society, Guile is fighting against Bison in hopes of bringing him to justice. Juri attacked Bison as well, with various combo attacks. Before she deals the fatal final blow, Bison's appearance changes into Twelve. He begins to attack her as his hands turn into claws. After the battle, Bison flees. As he escapes, Juri goes after him, and at some point, she is visited by C. Viper, who wished to recruit her. In response, Juri told her that she is done with working for S.I.N., Shadaloo, the\u00a0Secret Society\u00a0or any other organization that has taken a notice to her power. C. Viper told her that her revenge to restore the Han family is still possible. Juri then\u00a0decided to listen to her. She helped her out with her quest in order to find out about the DOLLS and the connection\u00a0between Shadaloo and the Secret Society who used her to their plains, she was going after one of other DOLLS that was with Delta Blue, but was\u00a0knocked out by the Shadaloo member F.A.N.G.

Darkstalkers.Gameplay Fighting style  Juri fights using Taekwondo and like most practitioners of the Korean martial art in fighting games (e.g. Kim Kaphwan from Fatal Fury/The King of Fighters and Hwoarang from Tekken), Juri is an offensive-oriented, general rushdown character whose moveset mostly focuses on various kicks; she is a very flashy fighter who likes to toy with her opponent, and is used best in bursts of aggression or playing footsies.Moveset  Juri \"roughs up\" many traditional Tae Kwon Do moves by putting her own sadistic spin on them, as well as throwing in a few of her own moves. She is designed to be a hectic character with fast attacks that keep her opponents off guard; as such, she is weak defensively, and many of her moves can leave her open if blocked. She was created to be a very hard character to learn, yet very rewarding once fully mastered. Juri has a short-range projectile that she can choose to charge in a method similar to Balrog's Turn Punch or El Fuerte's Quesadilla Bomb. If she chooses to charge it, she does a high kick that leaves a trail of energy which will hit very close opponents or cancel out approaching projectiles if timed correctly. Juri can then unleash her fireball/projectile at any time after that by releasing the button, either immediately or much later in the match. She also possesses an aerial dive kick that moves at several ranges depending on the kick button pressed, and can be followed up with more kicks, unlike most dive kicks. Her most notable technique is her pinwheel kick, which moves her forward as she does a wheel kick similar to Guile's Flash Kick and Chun-Li's Spinning Bird Kick. Juri also has a counter move known as Kasatushi, in which she taunts her enemy into hitting her, and if the opponent strikes, Juri will either move backwards, jump into the air (and optionally react with an air attack), or dart behind her opponent.. Juri's Super Combo, Fuharenjin, has her unleash a flurry of fireballs that juggles the opponent, ending with a fireball that hits the opponent in the air diagonally. Her first Ultra Combo is Feng Shui Engine, which is a time-based move that allows her to chain together combos with her normal moves that ordinarily wouldn't combo together via the power of Juri's eponymous eye. Her second Ultra Combo is Kaisen Dankairaku (chosen more often due to its easier use and direct damage), where Juri kicks the opponent, follows up with a multi-hit helicopter kick, and then kicks her opponent to the ground. Using the Feng Shui Engine's power, she gets to the ground before they land, \"catches\" them with one last kick, and then slams her opponent to the ground. In Street Fighter V, Juri maintains her moves. Her V-Trigger is the Feng Shui Engine (alpha); she chains her combos to her opponent. Her Critical Art is the Sakkai Fuhazan; Juri unleashes a devastating heel drop to inflict multiple hits on her opponent.Trivia Quotes  See also: Juri/QuotesGallery  Juri/GallerySee also References Evil Ryu  Evil Ryu (\u6bba\u610f\u306e\u6ce2\u52d5\u306b\u76ee\u899a\u3081\u305f\u30ea\u30e5\u30a6, Satsui no Had\u014d ni Mezameta Ry\u016b, \"Ryu with the Surge of Killing Intent Awakened\"), also known as Satsui Ryu (\u6bba\u610f\u30ea\u30e5\u30a6, Satsui Ry\u016b, lit. Killing Intent Ryu) or Dark Ryu, is a character from the Street Fighter series who was originally featured in the 1996 Street Fighter Zero manga before appearing as playable fighter in Street Fighter Alpha 2. This is the form Ryu takes if he ever succumbs to the Satsui no Hado.Biography Appearance  Evil Ryu first appeared as a palette swap of Ryu wearing a black or dark purple gi; in his gaming debut, the Alpha series also gives him a black headband. His skin and hair also featured a slightly dark shade. From the SNK vs. Capcom series onward, his eyes been depicted with red irises, although some games have his eyes glow entirely red. Like Akuma, Evil Ryu has a signature kanji that appears when he performs the Raging Demon; in Street Fighter Alpha 3 and Capcom vs. SNK 2, the kanji is \"destruction\" (\u6ec5, metsu), though it only appears in his endings and Super Combo Finishes. In Super Street Fighter IV: Arcade Edition, his design was given an update; he takes on a much more menacing and powerful appearance, with traits taken from Akuma. He now has fangs, his eyes glow, his gi, gloves, and headband are torn, and his hair is spiked upwards with a reddish tint. His voice is also more demonic sounding, and he also constantly emits a dark red aura during fights. Most notable of all is a gaping hole burned into his chest, with a similar scar on his back that bears a glowing \"heaven\" (\u5929, ten) kanji. The scar resembles the effects of being hit up close with Oni's Meido Gohado, and could also be a reference to a scene in the Ryu Final manga, in which Akuma punches through Ryu\u2019s chest in their final battle and almost defeats him. In Ryu's guest appearance in Asura's Wrath, it is Asura who gives him the scar after launching him into the moon from Earth and attempting to impale him with his fist. The scar disappears after he returns to normal.Personality  In the Street Fighter Alpha games, Evil Ryu is cold and conceited, and is obsessed with fighting in order to prove he is the strongest. In Super Street Fighter IV, he is a more demonic and murderous-driven being; while his anger is not mindless, he has purged all traces of his former honorable self. He enjoys absolute power, and lacks any sort of empathy or respect, and despises what he perceives as weakness from all of humanity, such as love, family, justice and vengeance. He is also extremely brutal towards other fighters in general, especially to those that oppose him. Evil Ryu also refers to himself as heartless and nothing more but a demon, and will seek out and murder any opponent in a fight, regardless of their age and condition. He displays a very dangerous blood thirst and a ritualistic belligerence that almost borders on cannibalism, as seen in many of his prefight and win quotes.Relationships Oni  While they have yet to meet each other in canon, Evil Ryu sees Oni as his rival and the only one who can give him a challenge.Sakura  In the Japanese version of Street Fighter Alpha 2 he outright threatens to kill her if she stands in his way, though his appearance is non-canon. This happens again in the Street Fighter IV OVA, albeit being in a temporary state, but as a canon event.Story Background  In the storyline of the original Street Fighter game, Ryu scarred and defeated Sagat with a single Shoryuken. The Street Fighter Alpha series later retconned this to Ryu losing control of himself by rising up fist first, striking Sagat with the Metsu Shoryuken. During Street Fighter Alpha 2, Ryu finally realized that the Satsui no Hado was the culprit behind his cheap victory over Sagat. Ryu vowed to reject the Satsui no Hado, but it wasn't enough to completely eliminate the Satsui no Hado, as it still resided within him; it was not until the end of Street Fighter IV that Gouken was able to seal it away using the \"Power of Nothingness\". Thus, it must be noted that Evil Ryu does not exist as a separate character, though it is naturally possible in some games (such as the home versions of Capcom vs. SNK 2: Mark of the Millennium 2001 and some versions of Street Fighter Alpha 3) for the player to include both normal Ryu and Evil Ryu in a battle, sometimes on the same team. In the home versions of Street Fighter Alpha 3, if the player matches normal Ryu against Evil Ryu, they have a special pre-match introduction that involves normal Ryu attacking first with a rushing elbow, and then Evil Ryu counterattacking, suggesting that the battle is taking place inside his mind, representing his struggle to\u00a0resist the temptation to give in to the Satsui no Hado.Street Fighter Alpha 2  Evil Ryu shares his rivals and ending with Ryu in the English versions. In the Japanese version, Evil Ryu makes a direct threat at Sakura telling her that she was in his way and will show no mercy, and with Akuma, Evil Ryu acknowledges Akuma as his master's enemy, and Akuma taunts him, refering to him as a boy and a beginner, and wonders if Ryu believes his own Satsui no Hado was a match for him. The following text scrolls after he is shown defeating Gouki (the name Akuma is called by in Japanese versions):Street Fighter Alpha 3  Evil Ryu encounters Sagat during his quest to become the ultimate fighter, and challenges him once again. Sagat told him to look at himself as he lost control of his power, and that he is not the same man he wanted to challenge. Annoyed, Evil Ryu tells him to shut up and fight; after defeating Sagat, he asks why Sagat held back, to which Sagat responds: \"Why should I? You are not the Ryu who left a scar on my chest!\" He tells Evil Ryu that a warrior wouldn't allow himself to be tempted by a \"cheap trick\", and that he will wait for his true rival to return and challenge him. After fighting and defeating several more opponents, Evil Ryu faces M. Bison at his true potential. M. Bison told Evil Ryu that he came a long way, but he is only human and cannot resist the evil energy within, and will plunge deeper into the darkness as his power grows. M. Bison considers Evil Ryu powerful enough to be his source of energy; Evil Ryu replies that M. Bison will not succeed, and fights and defeats him. Evil Ryu then travels to Shin Akuma's location. Both fighters used the Shun Goku Satsu on each other, and the attacks canceled out, saving both of their souls. Evil Ryu asks Shin Akuma that if he knows what lies ahead and what this evil energy will bring; Akuma simply replies that \"words do not have any meaning to us...\" and told him to satisfy his rage and anger and attack him, claiming that only the winner will know the truth. Upon finally defeating Shin Akuma, Evil Ryu is temporarily dazed, believing that he had become a true martial artist to experience this incredible power. As he hunched over and clutched his chest, Ryu screamed in excitement and experienced a flashback of him using the fated Metsu Shoryuken against Sagat in black and white. Claiming his fist is stained with \"the blood of death\", his eyes became red and his chest expanded as he screamed again. The last scene in his Story Mode shows Evil Ryu with his back turned, while looking at his fallen opponents, including M. Bison. He screams in excitement one last time and approaches the location of Akuma's stage, deeming himself \"the supreme master of the fist\". As the \"destruction\" (\u6ec5, metsu) kanji appears on the back of his gi, Evil Ryu's final words of the storyline (\"Where...? Where can I find the one who can defeat me?!\") reveal that his 'downfall' is complete, and he has now taken on Akuma's original burden. In the Game Boy Advance version of Street Fighter Alpha 3, Evil Ryu has an alternate ending if he lost to Shin Akuma. Shin Akuma states that while he fought well, he was no match for the Raging Demon, and that he is the embodiment of pure evil. This ending is only present in the aforementioned version.Ultra Street Fighter II: The Final Challengers  Some time after, Evil Ryu entered in the second World Warrior tournament. Once there, he defeats M. Bison in battle. Bison is speechless that his Psycho Power lost to Evil Ryu, to which the latter responded that defeating weaklings is not enough for him, as M. Bison's power does nothing for him to sate his thirst, and that his blood yearns for power. Evil Ryu then feels that his power to destroy everything will take him to new heights and sets out to search for Akuma, as he knows that Akuma is worth a fight to the death.Street Fighter IV series  In the original Street Fighter IV, Evil Ryu appears in Akuma's intro as a vision during his meditation in a remote location in a cave. In his intro for Super Street Fighter IV: Arcade Edition, he is shown in the middle of nowhere, lying down. As he regains consciousness, he has been fully engulfed by the Satsui no Hado, which grants him incredible power. He then sets out, saying that the ultimate power has awakened within him. In his ending, his actions have attracted the attention of Shadaloo, and two grunts intercept him with firearms, saying that M. Bison has summoned him. He pays them no heed and growls in rage, causing the grunts to panic, and murders them before they can react. As they lay on the ground, he says that he is not sated, that his Hado craves more blood and violence - something he claims nothing less than a fight to the death can quench.Street Fighter V  Evil Ryu appears in Ryu's dream from his prologue story who convinces his normal self about the power of destruction to kill and it is the destiny of his own fist. Ryu finally rejects his word and knowing this is not his answer.Crossover appearances Street Fighter EX  In his ending in the first Street Fighter EX, Evil Ryu challenges Akuma, who willingly accepts his challenge. In Street Fighter EX3, his ending mentions him letting out a blood-chilling scream, and that no one knows if that was the sign of Ryu's last bit of humanity fading away, or if it was a cry for help.SNK vs. Capcom: The Match of the Millennium  Evil Ryu appears as the final boss of the game. After being captured and stored in a pod where his power is forcibly awakened, he runs wild following M. Bison and Geese's defeat. Evil Ryu is referred to as, \"The Creature\", by both M. Bison and Geese, who panic when the capsule containing him explodes, leaving the player's team to deal with Evil Ryu himself, and it is not known what happens to Evil Ryu after the battle.Capcom vs. SNK 2  Evil Ryu's ending text after the last battle displays as follows:SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters Clash games  Evil Ryu appears as a collectible character card. He has a special ability called \"Evil Energy\", which is a Triangle-type ability (activated upon playing), and will knock out a frozen character of the player's choosing.Marvel vs. Capcom series  In Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes, when Ryu uses the Akuma style on the \"Complete Change Ryu\" mode, he is very similar to Evil Ryu in both physical aspect and fighting style. In Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, Evil Ryu appears as Ryu's 6th color scheme, and is more akin to his Capcom vs. SNK version, featuring red-tinted skin. In Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite, Evil Ryu appears an alternate costume for Ryu, as one of the four pre-order DLC costumes.Namco \u00d7 Capcom  Evil Ryu appears in this game upon succumbing to the Satsui no Hado after much persistence from Akuma and M. Bison's Psycho Power evolving to higher levels of power. He departs from his allies in search of blood, desiring no less than pure violence where it may exist. His evil form remains in the story until both the events of Rose's soul being cleansed from the mind control of Black Valkyrie and Ken performing the Shin Shoryuken on him in hopes to \"awaken\" him, of which he himself uses on M. Bison to disrupt the Psycho Power's stability, making him vulnerable from then on.Street Fighter X Tekken  While Evil Ryu does not make an appearance in Street Fighter \u00d7 Tekken, the in-game description for Ryu's \"Devil Jin\" swap costume states that a Devil version of him appears after getting unknowingly getting involved with the Mishima Clan turf wars caused by Heihachi Mishima, Kazuya Mishima, Lars Alexanderson, Nina Williams\u00a0and Jin Kazama who exposed him to his\u00a0Devil cells after getting into hated conflict with his origanzation.Asura's Wrath  Evil Ryu appears as the second and final opponent of the Asura's Wrath extra DLC episode \"Lost Episode 1: Finally Someone Angrier Than Me\", and is referred to as \"Hatred Incarnate\". After Asura changes into his six arms form, uppercuts Ryu into the moon and attempts to drive him through the chest with his fist, the Mathra causes the Satsui no \u00a0Satsui no Hado to\u00a0awakens, allowing\u00a0Ryu to transform into Evil Ryu. The previous SSFIV combat style used in the first part of the episode switches to the traditional one used for the game. Evil Ryu retains all of his moves from SSFIV, but they are significantly modified for the style of this game, allowing for a seemingly more accurate portrayal of his power (i.e. larger Hadokens); his Metsu Hadoken, now an energy beam,\u00a0is much stronger than most boss attacks in the game, and he uses it if he receives too many mantra shots from Asura. His Messatsu-Goshoryu lifts Asura way higher if the first two punches land, and the final punch strikes Asura so hard (deforming his face and crashing him to the ground) that it unlevels the part of the moon Augus previously\u00a0leveled in the story of the game. During the battle, he also receives an uppercut from the demigod's six arms, struggles in a headbutt contest and receives a very painful Atomic Drop on his tail bone.\u00a0The battle ends when both Asura and Evil Ryu attempt the Raging Demon on one another, and it ends in a draw, exhausting Ryu's Satsui no Hado, and returning both fighters\u00a0to normal.Tekken X Street Fighter  While Evil Ryu has yet to be fully confirmed to appear in Tekken x Street Fighter, a silhouette resembling him (along with a silhouette resembling Devil Jin) can be seen behind Ryu in the promotional artwork featuring Ryu and Jin.Comics Street Fighter Alpha manga  In this continuity, Evil Ryu appears after he is shot in his chest accidentally by an officer, he begins to go on a killing spree and tries to murder every single person on a ship. Many cops try to kill him with machine guns and pistols, realizing that he is not human and a very dangerous individual, though they stand no chance against him, as he simply just dodges every\u00a0bullet by using his Ashura Senku to move fast. He is held back by Birdie and Chun-Li, however, he begins to overpower them with ease, as they stood no chance against his fighting skills. They try to reason with him, as he refuses to listen to them and fights them relentlessly; he then tries to murder Chun-Li with a Shoryuken, only to be held back by Birdie, who tells her to stop him at any means before he kills more people. After he nearly beats Birdie to death, he attempts to murder a weakened Chun-Li with a Metsu Shoryuken before he holds back as fragments of Ryu's will resurfaces, and returns back to normal. Tired, he falls to the ground and shortly afterwards is taken into custody in order to gather more information about his Satsui no Hado.Street Fighter III: Ryu Final  Although Evil Ryu does not appear in Ryu Final, he is referenced by Akuma during his fight with Ryu.UDON comics  Evil Ryu does not directly appear in the original Street Fighter comics by Udon, but instead acts as a dark \"shadow\" for Ryu's internal struggle with the Satsui no Hado. In issue #0, a metaphorical fight between Ryu and his darker side is portrayed to characterize Ryu's battle within his mind and on certain occasions (such as during the end of the first World Warrior tournament in issue #1's backup story or during his battle with Akuma in issue #6) Ryu succumbs to the Satsui no Hado's influence and begins using more lethal versions of his art. However, Ryu never fully becomes Evil Ryu during the comic series as he is against the darker aspects of the power since it involves killing.\u00a0 Evil Ryu does however appear in volume two of the Super Street Fighter comic series, after absorbing\u00a0the Satsui no Hado from Sakura and Akuma's Hadoken. He transforms into Evil Ryu and fights Oni,\u00a0they are found by Gill who is in interested in this power, he\u00a0engages them in battle, he tells Evil Ryu that\u00a0he is seeking the salvation of the world, he suppresses the Satsui no Hado in Ryu, which in turns him back into his normal state, he tells Ryu that there will be a time when he will be a great use to his world when the time comes as he and his younger brother leave into a helicopter while Gill flies by using his elemental powers to create ice wings behind his back. In the Unlimited series, Ryu's hold on the Satsui no Hado has\u00a0become even harder due to absorbing Sakura and Akuma's Satsui no Hado as he now has\u00a0visions of him murdering his friends and looking less human and more\u00a0like a demon.\u00a0Street Fighter \u00d7 G.I. Joe  Evil Ryu makes an appearence in the crossover story after Ryu is fought by Jinx, with Ryu himself turning back to normal before he had transformed completely into his evil form.Street Fighter: The Novel\u00a0  Evil Ryu appears Street Fighter: The Novel.Daigo The Beast  Evil Ryu is seen in the Daigo The Beast manga.Animation and movies Street Fighter II V  Though not explicitly called as such, an incarnation similar to Evil Ryu appears in Street Fighter II V. This form is brought about by one of Shadaloo's cyber chips being implanted into his forehead in order to control his mind, rather than having glowing white or red eyes, his eyes are pink (this is likely due to the cyber chips being powered by Psycho Power). As shown on one of the brainwave monitors, his mind is shown to be in a state of constant heightened aggression and is unable to use the Hadouken until manually ordered from a console to calm down. This state of Ryu predates the Evil Ryu of the games proper as the episode of his debut was in 1995, a year before the character's introduction in the Street Fighter Alpha manga.Street Fighter Alpha: The Animation  Evil Ryu appears shortly after training in a temple at night as he has thoughts about Akuma killing Gouken by ripping his hand though him, the Satsui no Hado starts to corrupt him as he comes to his master\u2019s grave stone and once again starts to have thoughts of Akuma coming to him, the Satsui no Hado from his body begins to level a part of the forest and Gouken\u2019s gravestone, leaving him unconscious on the ground. After finding out about Shun, Ryu starts to feel the emergence of the Satsui no Hado awaking inside him, he is then possessed by it and walks outside, Ken begins to feel the dark power coming from the outside, and discovers that the dark power is coming from Ryu. As Ken calls out to him, Ryu begins to attack Ken, Ken then realizes that that the dark power that he is sensing is the Satsui no Hado, as Ryu tries to attack him once again, Ken punches him, breaking Ryu from its possession over him. That night, Ryu told Ken that if he cannot break from the Satsui no Hado\u2019s influence, he must stop him from killing other people. The next day, Shun is fighting against Zangief, and he starts fall to the Satsui no Hado, this event causes Ryu to be influenced by Shun\u2019s own Satsui no Hado, as Shun begins to lose against Zangief as he holds him in a bear hug, Ryu breaks free of Shun\u2019s influence over him, he starts to fight against Zangief on his own. Shun\u2019s own Satsui no Hado awakens inside him and starts to influence Ryu\u2019s own Satsui no Hado, turning into Evil Ryu, he starts to perform a Metsu Hadoken, as he is just about to fire it against Zangief, Ken calls out to him, Ryu breaks out of it, he throws his Hadoken at the top of the building, the impact of the attack is so powerful, it begins to level and destroy the entire top of the building. When Ryu asks Shun about how he learned that power, Shun reveals that their father was using the Dark Hado too. Before Ryu could get more answers, a cyborg attacks him in order to gain more data. As Shun takes a hit for Ryu, he becomes angry, and the Satsui no Hado starts waking up inside, as Evil Ryu fires a Hadoken at the cyborg, its whole body is completely destroyed. Ryu slowly begins to wonder if he will end up like Akuma. Later on, he is visited by Rose, she tells him that Shun needs help, and Ryu must keep on going. He then travels to Akuma\u2019s island in order to get some answers, he is then influenced by Akuma\u2019s Satsui no Hado, turning him to Evil Ryu. As Akuma comes near Ryu, he askes Akuma if he has a family, Akuma told him that he walks alone. Evil Ryu appears after he sees Ken being beaten by a cyborg. He turns into Evil Ryu. After freeing Shun, he fights Sadler who had gained all data from all of the other fighters he kidnapped. As Ryu fires another Metsu Hadoken, he is retained by Rose. After Sadler performs a Hadoken at Evil Ryu, Ryu breaks free of the Satsui no Hado once and for all, and destroys Sadler with his own Hadoken.Street Fighter Alpha: Generations  Evil Ryu appears when Ryu desperately decides to discard the meaning of a true warrior as he is put into a dire situation by Akuma, as many spirits of other warriors come to see his fight against Akuma. He starts to attack Akuma by kicking him in the leg, twisting his foot on it for further injury, but Akuma goes back on the offensive, and he is then punched in the face by Akuma and is slammed down. Akuma told him that the Satsui no Hado is the true call of a fighter, declaring that he was right, and that Ryu who now stands before him, proved his point. Evil Ryu then tries to perform a Shun Goku Satsu on Akuma, only to be stopped by a flower, he breaks out of the Satsui no Hado\u2019s influence over him, and realizes that the flower is showing an image of Fukka.Street Fighter IV: The Ties That Bind  Evil Ryu appears during the scene with Ryu in the desert for a split second in response to Akuma's speech about taking lives and getting stronger. He appears later on, just after C. Viper finishes mauling Cammy in front of Ryu's eyes in order to awaken his power. He is then taken over by the Satsui no Hado and loses control of his actions, and he begins fighting C. Viper, who had underestimated the dangerous power of the Satsui no Hado and states that he was too powerful to be captured in his current state. Ken and Sakura suddenly arrived on the scene by car, which then distracted Evil Ryu, allowing C. Viper the chance to retreat back to the S.I.N. HQ via her jet boots by leaping off a cliff. However, Evil Ryu ignored Ken's pleas to stop, and began destroying S.I.N equipment and chasing down the personnel relentlessly. Two of the remaining agents begin firing at Evil Ryu with their handguns, only for their bullets to bounce off him, causing them to panic and run; one of the fleeing agents falls, and sees Evil Ryu quickly approaching him. Sakura grabs Evil Ryu by the arm from behind, and tries to push him back; he raises his arm to attack Sakura, but stops as he gazes at her face, and then reverts back to normal and collapses to his knees, staring in a slightly catatonic state as he was realizing what he was about to do next.Other appearances Street Fighter EX series Background  Very much like Akuma, Ryu's fighting spirit happens to be very compatible with the Satsui no Hado power of murderous intent. While Akuma embraced this power in order to truly become the greatest fighter in the world, Ryu and Ken master, Gouken, worked hard to shield them from such an influence, and taught them a method of fighting that was devoid of assassination techniques. However, Akuma sensed in Ryu the capacity for Satsui no Hadou and awaited the day when Ryu would accept it and become a worthy challenger for combat. Ryu was unaware of this, and first tapped into the power of Satsui no Hadou at the end of the first official Street Fighter tournament during the championship fight against Sagat. Sagat was about the end the match with a crushing blow when Ryu, refusing to lose the match, lost control over his discipline and struck Sagat with a deadly dragon punch that ripped Sagat's chest open, leaving a damaging scar. Trouble by the loss of control, Ryu struggled to understand what caused that to happen, and how he could prevent it from ever happening again. During the first EX tournament, Ryu was confronted by Akuma. Akuma was hoping that after his fight with Sagat, Ryu would have embraced Satsui no Hado and he could fight Akuma in a manner that was worthy of Akuma's power. Disappointed that Ryu had not reached that potential, he announced to Ryu that he murdered Ryu's master in hopes of speeding up the process. Ryu was unable to chase after Akuma to extract revenge, as he was prevented by M. Bison who wanted Ryu to join his Shadowloo army. When he rejected Bison's offer, Bison attacked, watching with great amusement the anger that grew in Ryu and the changes to his physical power that took place as a result. Eventually Bison realized that Ryu was a completely different person, completely consumed by Satsui no Hado, and Ryu complicitly accepted Bison's offer since he believed he would get the chance to kill Akuma as a result. To test Ryu's new capabilities, Bison sent Ryu on to his next match, which happened to be with his old training partner Ken. Ken recognized that Ryu was different, and did all that he could to affect a change in Ryu that would restore Ryu's mind. Ken succeeded in doing so, and after the two defeated Bison in combat, he helped Ryu come to grips with the power that lay inside Ryu. Ryu vowed to never allow Satsui no Hado to take control of his mind ever again. Though many times he has failed that comminment.Endings Street Fighter EX Plus \u03b1  \"An evil chi is rising... Everything has suddenly been destroyed.\" He raised his bloodstained fist to the air, laughed, and suddenly he vanished. Satsui no Hadou... Will the tragedy of a greatly burdened fist be repeated?Street Fighter EX3  Ryu feels nothing but evil for he is now possessed by an urge to kill, which makes him destroy everything, whether he desires it or not. Standing under a bloody moon, Ryu shrieks a frightening howl. Did he scream over his lost soul, or was it for lost joy in finding his true self? Whichever it was, it is all he has left...Gameplay Fighting style  Like his normal form, Evil Ryu fights using the unnamed Ansatsuken fighting style.Moveset  Evil Ryu's moveset combines elements of the original Ryu and Akuma, such as Ryu's simplistic and slightly slow inputs with Akuma's strong combo and power potential, which generally leans slightly towards the former due to the presence of his unique normal attacks (though he also has the latter's Ashura Senku). While he generally strikes stronger and faster, his attacks still come out a bit slower than Akuma's, and their long startup requires the player to maintain a constant rhythm of attacks. Evil Ryu's main strength is the potential to constantly pin the opponent with fierce attacks, and he can deal immense damage with his Target Combos if the opponent makes a mistake. However, his low stamina, while slightly higher than Akuma's, does not allow much room for error. Evil Ryu's play style in general is meant to be a full-on offensive fighter, with only the Ashura Senku to get him out of a tight spot, but nothing to make use for defensive play unlike other characters like Guile, who can make use of both attack and defense. His low stamina seems to hint at his lack of defensive options, and Evil Ryu's movement speed is a bit slow, which can hinder him if a careless player is caught in a combo. In Super Street Fighter IV: Arcade Edition, Evil Ryu has an updated moveset that is much closer to Akuma's, including his unique attacks, and adds a new special move called the Ryusokyaku. Additionally, as a boss character in Arcade Edition, Evil Ryu has the ability to cancel into his Ashura Senku from any of his normal or special attacks, as well as being able to cancel most of his moves into the Raging Demon. This makes it very dangerous to attack him up close.Super/Ultra Combos  Evil Ryu's Super Combos are also a mixture of Ryu and Akuma's; among his Super Combos is the Shun Goku Satsu, which is naturally identical to Akuma's, though it has lower priority and can easily be beaten. In his appearances in the Alpha series, he uses Ryu's Shinku Hadoken and Shinku Tatsumaki Senpukyaku, as well as Akuma's Messatsu-Goshoryu and Shun Goku Satsu (with the latter being a 'hidden' Level 3 Super Combo). In his latest appearance, his first Ultra Combo, the Metsu Hadoken, is functionally the same as Ryu's, though it can now be charged. His second Ultra Combo is the Messatsu-Goshoryu, which works as it did in previous appearances, and now adds an additional attack if the combo connects properly.Pop Culture  Evil Ryu/Pop CultureTrivia Gallery  Evil Ryu/GallerySprites  Evil Ryu/SpritesSee also References Sakura  Sakura Kasugano (\u6625\u65e5\u91ce \u3055\u304f\u3089, Kasugano Sakura) is a video game character from the Street Fighter series, first appearing in Street Fighter Alpha 2. She is a Japanese girl with an intense fixation on Ryu, having copied and learned many of his techniques, and chasing him around the world to prove herself to him.Biography Appearance  Sakura typically fights in her school's uniform - a short-skirted sailor uniform (seifuku) with the collar popped and red bloomers (short shorts) underneath. She also wears red Converse-esque shoes, a midriff-baring red top under her uniform, red\u00a0sparring gloves, a yellow bola tie, and a white headband that was given to her\u00a0by Ryu before the events of\u00a0Street Fighter Alpha 2. She has short brown hair and brown eyes. Her fuku is blue with single white linings in each sides and white socks. In Street Fighter IV and Street Fighter X Tekken, her socks are shorter and the color is navy blue. Her school uniform becomes her \"Nostalgia\" costume in Street Fighter V. In her ending in Super Street Fighter IV, her hair is slighty longer, she wears a red high-neck sporty jacket with a single line at the center, a white short sleeved undershirt, black shorts, white socks and white sneakers with matching designs. She also maintains her white headband. In Street Fighter V, Sakura wears a different outfit that consists of a navy blue vest with a pink trim, a white long sleeve button shirt underneath, a pleated skirt with frills at the edge, black mid-length socks and black short (possibly Docs) boots. Her bolero tie is long and the color are pink and white and is tied at her midriff baring top. Like Ryu's, her headband is red along with matching gloves with a stylized written on the white lines. She also has a head microphone at the left side of her ear. The new outfit that Sakura wears is her college uniform where she studies at the university and during her part-time job in her character story. Her first alternate costume is a blue arcade uniform; a blue short sleeved collared shirt with a yellow trim and collar, a matching ID on her neck, dark blue and black checkered skirt, black socks with red linings and blue sneakers with yellow toe caps. She wears a matching blue cap in place of her headband. She also has a Blanka-Chan doll on her waist. Her second costume is an outfit similar to Ryu's which is a white karate gi with the sleeves ripped into sleeveless, a black karate belt which is tucked into her gi and matching karate pants. Underneath her gi is the red midriff baring top from her school uniform and she wears red footguards.Personality  In many aspects, Sakura is very outgoing and respectful in personality, as she is most of the time happy, energetic, cheerful, positive, hard-working and focused in combat. She has a noble spirit and a very determined attitude, either in studies or in martial arts training. She sees Ryu as an idol and teacher, rather than an opponent, since she always watches him fight and mirrors herself on his philosophies in battle. Although her techniques may seem somewhat \"rustic\" in comparison to Ryu and Ken, she manages to balance her school work with her trainings in hopes of being accepted as Ryu's student and prove herself by fighting worthy adversaries. In a clean match, Sakura is a very patient and disciplined warrior. She is the embodiment of innocence and is acknowledged by many\u00a0fighters to have great potential that may one-day match Ryu and Ken in strength when she gets older.Character Relationships Ryu  Ryu is Sakura's main inspiration for taking up street fighting and deeply admires him like a childhood hero and role model.Ken  Similar to Ryu, Sakura sees Ken as an inspiration for street fighting. Although while she holds Ryu in a much higher regard, she still thinks highly of Ken.Karin  After their first fight in Sakura Ganbaru!, both women have sparked a rivalry (similar to Ryu and Ken's rivalry) because of Karin's first loss in a long lasting winning streak. However once Karin won their rivalry match in Street Fighter Alpha 3 she admitted that Sakura is indeed better than her and that she only won by luck. After that, they became close friends as well as continuing their friendly rivalry, which is noticeable in one of her win quotes in Super Street Fighter IV and all other interactions with her despite having completely opposite personalities. In  Street Fighter V: Arcade Edition, Karin invites Sakura to the Kanzuki Estate to have a match. Sakura wins, but then ask Karin why is she still picking fights, Karin responds with the fact of fighting is the best way to test skill. Sakura then dismisses the idea and ponders if spending time growing in strength is the best way to go about things. Karin then asked Sakura would it be different if she was fighting with Ryu. She calls fighting with Ryu a \"different story\". Karin then calls Ryu and tells him to go to the Kasugano Residence for Sakura's problems.Dan  Since Dan was her \"sensei\", Sakura respects him as both a friend and a teacher. However, this friendship is double-sided, because she often uses him to find Ryu whenever she needs to. In return, Dan boasts her as one of his star students, perhaps helping him give Saikyo-ryu some credibility.Ibuki  Both being high-school girls, Sakura and Ibuki have been able to hold a close relationship with one another. This is mainly because of the latter's interest in boys and that Ibuki had never met someone so \"cool\" that's also within her age group, allowing the two to get to know one another easier than with older fighters. It was thanks to this that Ibuki got the attention of Karin in Street Fighter V.Cammy  Even though there has been no example of an in-game friendship beforehand, Cammy and Sakura have been close friends, as Cammy has been shown to deeply care about her. This started in the second volume of Sakura Ganbaru (roughly before/during the Street Fighter Alpha series), when Cammy was an amnesic after defecting from Shadaloo and Sakura interfered with an assassination attempt on the former. After that, they travelled alongside Chun-Li to Russia where they tag-teamed against Zangief in a cage match before going their separate ways. From then onwards, Cammy and Sakura are still friends and have a friendly rivalry during battle, as shown in her win quotes against each other in Street Fighter IV.Elena  Elena and Sakura are seen as friends due to being roughly the same age and because both girls share a kind-hearted, tomboyish personality. They both share the same views about fighting and combat, making their friendship easygoing without trouble. According to Elena's arcade ending in Ultra Street Fighter IV, it was thanks to Sakura that she got to know more about Japan and planned to go back to meet her again.Kei  Kei Chitose is a close friend of Sakura who attends the same high school, Tamagawa Minami High. She sometimes goes along with Sakura on her adventures but more often than not fails to keep up with the energetic Sakura.Hinata, Natsu and Shoma  Like Kei, Sakura and all three students are high-school friends, though all three students are from separate schools in the same area as Tamagawa Minami High (Taiyo High and Gorin High respectively). When Sakura is challenged by Karin in Street Fighter Legends: Sakura, they help her train as well as catch Karin cheating in the hot-dog eating contest and take out Karin's bodyguards when they fought. Sakura is mostly seen with Hinata and Natsu in some screenshots where they are seen eating desserts at the coffee shop and leaving the school together in the game's ending in Nekketsu Seisyun Nikki 2.Story Background  Not much is known about Sakura's early life other then she is best friends with her fellow classmate, Kei Chitose. Sakura begun to participate in street fighting after watching Ryu win the first World Warrior tournament. This takes place before her role in Rival Schools: United by Fate.Street Fighter Alpha 2  Skipping school to search the world for Ryu, Sakura embarks on a long journey to find him and become his student. Along the way, Sagat notices her techniques are similar to Ryu's and demands she tell him where he is. She doesn't know herself and comments on how rude he is and the two fight. In her individual ending, Sakura remembers when her and Ryu fought each other and requested him to be her master. Ryu refused, saying that he still has much to learn himself. Before he left, Sakura asked if she could at least take a photo of them before he left as a keepsake, which she is seen reminiscing over on her way to school. As she's walking, her best friend Kei shows up and cheers her up before having to dash because they are late.Street Fighter Alpha 3  At age 16, she was still fighting, and decided to travel the world to find Ryu. She started off in her native Japan and fought the sumo wrestler E. Honda, who mentioned Ryu was going off to such places as India and Thailand. She also fought a rematch with her rival Karin Kanzuki, and though Karin won the fight, she admitted Sakura was better and she had learned winning was not everything. Thereafter traveling with her sensei, Dan, she met his friend Blanka along the way and was promised a match with him. She continued to search the world for Ryu, eventually ditching Dan and finding Ryu's friend and rival Ken. She commented to him how she loved to fight to better herself, and finding inspiration in those words himself, Ken and Sakura eventually found Ryu in Thailand, where he was actually being brainwashed by M. Bison. Sagat had come by this time to find the scene as well, and as Sagat took on Ryu, both Ken and Sakura took on Bison. A combination of Sakura screaming for Ryu and Sagat's urgings finally snapped\u00a0Ryu out of the mind control and he defeated Bison, destroying him temporarily. He told Sakura then he was not ready to train her and fight a rematch with her yet, and walked off, with Sakura watching him go. She then realized that there was something really special about Ryu, but she didn't know what.Street Fighter IV  Sakura returns to fight again, still searching for Ryu, Some time after the end of the second World Warrior tournament, she confronts Dan about whether he knows anything about where Ryu might be. Dan, not wanting to appear out of the loop, says that a new tournament is rumored to be about to start, and that Ken will be participating, speculating that Ryu will also be there. Ecstatic, Sakura immediately runs off to enter. She, Dan and Blanka depart on a cruise ship on which she endures a grueling self-imposed training regime. During the tournament, she actively seeks out Ryu, eventually finding him in the S.I.N. building in the midst of destroying the BLECE project. The force of the struggle knocks Sakura unconscious, and she awakes to see a triumphant Ryu standing over her. The two escape from the S.I.N. building in the midst of explosions - which were probably Vega's doing - and run into Dan and Blanka along the way. After the tournament, Sakura and Ryu exchange goodbyes and she leaves for home on the ship. In her ending, a slightly older-looking Sakura is shown walking with her dog in an area near the Overpass when she sees Ryu approaching.Street Fighter V: Arcade Edition  Having graduated high school and now going in university, Sakura now works part-time at an arcade named Plaza Capcom, but wonders what decisions she needs to make in order to be satisfied with her future.Character story  After a match against Karin, Sakura asks why she always picks a fight with her for no reason, to which Karin replies that a fight with Sakura is the best way to test her skills. Sakura states that neither of them are kids anymore and questions not only if their fights are the best way to use of their time but also if becoming stronger is the right way for her to live. Karin wonders if Sakura would say the same thing if Ryu was present, to which Sakura gets excited and asks if Karin has seen him, the latter explains that she saw him during a recent crisis when she summoned a group of fighters from around the world, and that she is certain that Ryu is still training. At her workplace, Sakura thinks about how she wish she could see Ryu again, but realises how she must continue at her part-time job and not travel around the world at a whim like she used to. She goes back to work when one of the customers notifies about someone \"going crazy\" at the arcades. On her way home, Sakura thinks about her life and future when she bumps into Ryu who mentions that Karin summoned him because of Sakura. After a fight to ease Sakura's mind, Ryu praises her for growing stronger and more mature. Sakura asks Ryu about his life, stating that no matter how strong he becomes, he will eventually grow old and die, wondering if that's the right life for him. Ryu asks if she means he should take on a disciple to carry on his skills to the next generation, stating that he is still in training and can't take one. Sakura says she meant having children to create new bonds in life. Ryu replies that he never thought of it but consider it another type of strength. Sakura agrees and thanks Ryu for his answer, now knowing what she wants in life. In a short awkward moment, a slightly embarrassed Sakura quickly corrects herself by saying she is not planning on having children right now.Character story appearances  Sakura appears in the last part of Karin's character story, where she is warmly welcomed by Karin upon her return to the Kanzuki Estate. She says that she was happy to hear from Karin's steward that Karin wanted to see her and fight her in a match as part of a friendly challenge. Sakura states that Karin hasn't changed, as the two girls are ready to fight. Sakura is last seen in Ibuki's character story and the two are seen having a conversation with each other with their cellphones. Sakura informs Ibuki about the party invitation sent by Karin which Ibuki didn't read yet. She also informs her that she can't come to the party because of conflict schedules before hanging up. In Karin's party at the Kanzuki Estate, Karin also mentions Sakura due to Ibuki being as Sakura's friend. In Blanka's character story, which takes place around the same time as her own, Sakura steps in when Blanka accidentally broke the arcade machine. After the battle, Blanka apologizes for breaking the machine. Sakura tells the arcade manager to put Blanka's \"Blanka-chan\" dolls inside the machine.Crossover appearances Marvel vs. Capcom series  Sakura appeared as a playable character in Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter and Marvel vs. Capcom 2.

Later, they find Ryu under the control of the Satsui no Hado after Cammy is both defeated and gravely wounded by Crimson Viper.

At the end, she tells Ken that she's leaving because of the prices for plane tickets have gone down and she couldn't miss the chance to get them since she has to go back to Japan.Other appearances Street Fighter EX series Background  Sakura is a young school girl from Japan. She is a very competitive child, and frequently encounters new hobbies or activities that she would like to become the best in the world at. But no activity captivated her quite as much as street fighting the day she happened to see Ryu fighting in a sparring match. The way that he fought, his ability to harness his inner ki and release it in the form of energy from his hands, fascinated Sakura like nothing else. From that moment on, Sakura was determined to find Ryu and ask him to teach her. Fortunately, Sakura was naturally quite gifted at fighting, and found that she was able to reproduce some of the arts that she saw Ryu perform just by concentrating and imitating him. Her technique wasn't identical to Ryu's as she put her own spin on things, but she still hoped that Ryu could teach her how to perfect her techniques. When she heard that a Street Fighter tournament was being held, she signed up with a moment's hesitation. Dragging her school mate around the world for a summer, she arrived at the competition, and did surprisingly well, but failed to advance far enough to meet and challenge Ryu. She did catch up with him after one of his fights, and he was flattered by her appreciation, but felt that he was not ready to take on any students. When the second tournament was announced, Sakura was completely bummed out by the fact that it was in the middle of the school year, and she was prevented from entering by her parents. When the third tournament rolled around, and it was announced that fighters were to have partners, she was \"sure\" that she could convince Ryu to be her partner. Unfortunately for her, Ryu decided to partner with his long time training partner Ken. Dismayed, she spotted another girl around her age who also seemed disappointed. Her name was Nanase, and she had hoped to fight with her older sister Hokuto, but Hokuto decided to partner with her brother Kairi. Sakura felt that she found a terrific partner and Nanase agreed. However, once it came time to develop a strategy, they bickered quite a lot amongst themselves, and never really came to an agreement about how best to proceed. As a result, they were quickly knocked out in the first round. Angry at one another for the loss, they decided to never speak to each other again.Endings Street Fighter EX Plus \u03b1  \"And that's how justice prevailed! What...?\" \"Huh, you just came back from Thailand, Sakura? Don't tell me... You expect me to swallow that story like that time you told me about the old guy in the pink undergarments.\" Sakura ignored her friend Kei's concern and returned to the battle arena. \"Street fighting and myself. We can't be apart.\"Street Fighter EX3  Dear Mom and Dad\nI hope you are both doing well. I am so sorry that I ran away without a single word. I miss you both dearly.

I'm sure.\nSAKURA: Will you have another fight with me someday?\n(She shakes hands with him strongly.)\nRYU: Sure, why not?Gameplay Fighting style  Sakura fights using an emulated (and thus comparatively weaker) version of Ryu's fighting style; her applications of the moves lead to a unique approach to the \"Shotokan\" fighting style, with a different gameplay style from that of Ryu's.Moveset  Sakura's moveset contains many \"unorthodox\" variants of existing 'Shotokan' moves, including a 'running' Shoryuken, a jumping Tatsumaki, and a less-powerful Hadoken that she can charge, though at the cost of distance. Her moves and combos have high potential to stun opponents and also provide many an opportunity for mix-ups. However, her somewhat low stamina and her lack of other available approaches (particularly her weak projectile) require a certain amount of finesse, leaving little room for error; this ultimately makes Sakura a high-risk, high-reward character. Sakura's combo-heavy playstyle, when supplemented by her normals and special, make her a devastating fighter once she gets an opening. In Street Fighter V, she retains most of her moves in Street Fighter IV and has new moves to her arsenal such as Oukakyaku, Kashinfu and Tengyo Hadoken. Her playstyle is similar to Ken Masters when she executes her Midare Zakura and her Shunpukyaku as part of her EX specials. Her V-Skill is Haru Kaze where Sakura leaps forward at the opponent, and once in the air has three different follow up options. Hitting punch will perform her Sakura Otoshi which can be pressed up to three times to continue the combo by using her two new moves. She has two V-Triggers, the first is Haru Arashi which is similar to Ryu's Denjin Renki as her two Hadokens now gained electricity or utilizing it to make it as a combo. Her second is Sakura Senpu where both arms and feet are embedded with electricity to amplified her special attacks to make increase damage to her opponent.Techniques  She can successfully manipulate ki, and is subsequently able to perform the Hadoken energy attack; however, due to her lack of training, she cannot throw it the full length of the arena like Ken or Ryu can. Unlike Ryu and other\u00a0fighters from the same style, however, she can control the size of her Hadoken and throw larger Hadoken projectiles that sacrifice range and execution speed for size and power (up to 3 times larger). In the Marvel vs. Capcom series, she throws her Hadokens diagonally upwards, though her \"Hiyakeshita\" (literally \"Sunburned\") version still throws them horizontally. In Capcom vs. SNK, she is given an energy spark instead of a traditional projectile (called the \"Hadoushou\") that hits 3 times, but is limited to the area in front of her hands (though her EX version lets her use her special version of the Hadoken). Her other attacks include \"Shunpukyaku\", a short version of the \"Tatsumaki Senpukyaku\" attack that, instead of sailing through the air, rises and falls in an arcing pattern and traditionally only goes about 60% of the screen at its longest range; and \"Shouoken\", a version of the \"Shoryuken\". She performs it by running and throwing body blows ending the combination with an uppercut. Her Super Combos include her own interpretations of the Shinku Hadoken (which, like her regular projectile, will not cover the full length of the screen) and Shoryureppa (\"Midare Zakura\"). Her third Super Combo is a ground-based spinning leg attack (called the \"Haru Ichiban\", literally translated as \"first one of the spring\") that ends with a side kick that knocks her opponent away. In the Marvel vs. Capcom series, the Street Fighter EX series and Rival Schools, she also gains the Raging Demon in her sunburned form, although it has no canonical reference on the Street Fighter series. In Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix, Sakura retains most of her moves but she gains a yellow umbrella when she executes her Shouoken or her Midare Zakura Mighty Combo. Two of her special attacks has her comically beat and later use a motor scooter to hurt the opponent. She also has four disguises to serve as her special attacks (Eg. a tennis player, a soccer outfit, a Playboy bunny girl and her blue one-piece suit while wielding a baseball bat or a long towel to slip her opponents). Her other Mighty Combo has her in a disguised Playboy bunny girl calling two muscular men to drag her opponent to beat them down, the opponents can be seen being brutally beaten or being crazy in love (when her opponents are females). In her appearance in Street Fighter EX3, she gains two unique Meteor Combos: first is the \"Nekketsu Hadoken\", in which she fires a massive, pink Hadoken, which is several times her size, exceptionally fast, and does more damage than any other projectile attack in the game; the second is \"Genki Ichiban\", which can deal about 80% damage to an opponent but is widely telegraphed (she tiptoes toward her opponent and points & laughs; the pointing is unblockable and causes a great deal of knockback). In Street Fighter V, her Critical Art is the Sakura Rain where she shoots Hadoken to knock her opponent. As she strikes her pose, she hits her opponent with a powerful Shunpukyaku and heavily punch to the opponent's groin followed by an uppercut to knock them down. Her punch and uppercut to her opponent nearly resembles a slower version of Ryu's Metsu Shoryuken.Quotes  See: Sakura/QuotesPop Culture  Sakura/Pop CultureTrivia Gallery  Sakura/GallerySprites  Sakura/SpritesSee also References Gouken  Gouken (\u30b4\u30a6\u30b1\u30f3(\u525b\u62f3), G\u014dken, \"Constitutionality\", \"Strong Fist\") is a character from the Street Fighter series who was originally featured in the 1993 manga Street Fighter II: Ryu before appearing as a playable fighter in Street Fighter IV. He is a master martial artist and mentor to Ryu and Ken as well as the older brother of Akuma.Biography Appearance  Gouken is most often depicted as an elderly yet very well-built man with a white beard and prayer beads around his neck. In his most recent Street Fighter IV appearance, Gouken wears a single sleeved, gray-colored karate gi and sports a long, white braid of hair adorned with a single prayer bead.Alternate Costumes  Gouken's first alternate costume has his gi top removed; he now sports bandages on his forearms, and a rope on his back, extremely similar to the one found on Akuma's first alternate costume. Gouken's second alternate costume is an altered gi with a conical hat similar to those once worn by ashigaru, foot soldiers employed by the samurai of feudal Japan. Gouken's third alternate costume is an outfit worn by the Yamabushi, who are Japanese mountain ascetic monks who followed the Shugend\u014d doctrine. Gouken's fourth alternate costume has him imagined as Poseidon, the Greek god of the sea. Gouken's fifth alternate costume has him wearing a red leisurely haori with black pants and a drum hanging off the belt, while accessorized with black wrist guards and brown leather body straps similar to those of the aforementioned yamabushi with wings on the back and a tengu mask. Gouken's Horror themed costume has him imagined as an \"evil\" counterpart; he wears but a brown loincloth and shorts, with chains bound on his right arm and left leg. On his chest is branded his symbolic kanji of \"mu\".Personality  Gouken's personality is naturally that of the archetypical \"master elder\", which is common within media related to martial arts; the \"elder\" personality type is evident in the same type of media (as well as Western media characters such as Pai Mei); despite this, he does have many aspects that do have him stand out as a character. As stern and serious as he can be, Gouken is nonetheless enthusiastic in the nature of competition, being a spirited and modest good sport at heart. His approach is silent and calm, evocative of \"zen\" principles, and he often shares insightful (if not also blunt and critical) advice and wisdoms to that effect. For example, he tells Dan that anger will not help him (fearing it would lead him to a dark place), and he informs Dee Jay that if he is silent, he would be surprised at what he learns. He is on good terms with people like Rose and Dhalsim, who share similar ideals and beliefs. Gouken detests Akuma for killing\u00a0their master, Goutetsu, and embracing the darkness that resides within their arts instead of seeking a more pure form of strength. He also despises Bison for his use of Psycho Power, believing he endangered the world.Concept  While earlier Street Fighter games made references to Ryu and Ken's master, Gouken made his first illustrated appearance in Street Fighter II: Ryu, Masaomi Kanzaki's manga adaptation of Street Fighter II. Since then, Gouken has appeared in several Street Fighter movies and comics, including UDON's Street Fighter line of comics, Akuma's ending in Street Fighter Alpha, and the Street Fighter Alpha: Generations movie. Before his illustration in Street Fighter Alpha, Gouken's appearance would differ vastly between media. Gouken himself was based off Sheng Long, a character that originated from the infamous English mistranslation of Ryu's win quote from the early versions of the Street Fighter II series (\"You must defeat Sheng Long to stand a chance\"), which many speculated was referring to Ryu's master; it was intended to say \"you must defeat my Shoryuken to stand a chance\". April Fools jokes created by EGM in 1992 and 1997 actually provided an appearance for Sheng Long, which in turn directly influenced Gouken's current appearance. It should be noted that, prior to Street Fighter IV, Sheng Long was actually used as Gouken's western name in some media, similar to how his brother is referred to as either Akuma or Gouki depending on the region. Gouken was finally introduced as a playable character in Street Fighter IV in response to fans demanding Sheng Long. One of his obtainable player titles states \"AKA Sheng Long\", and one of his win quotes even references the original quote (\"You must defeat me to stand a chance\"). It's likely that Gouken's personality was based off Morihei Ueshiba.Character Relationships Allies Ryu  Ryu is Gouken's first disciple and adopted son. Gouken inspired him to be a martial artist and views him as a son, but no longer views him as a student, but as a rival, as he has gone far in his journey and is skilled enough to learn his own techniques. He also helped him overcome the Satsui no Hado.Ken  Ken is Gouken's second disciple and the son of his best friend. Gouken trained Ken when he was young, but no longer trains him, as, like Ryu, he is already skilled and views him as a rival due to this.Dan  Gouken has little respect for his former disciple, kicking him out because of his desire for vengeance and his lack of skill; however is also concerned for his former student as he could harbor the Satsui no Hado as a result.Retsu  Retsu is mentioned to be a friend of his.Enemies Akuma  Akuma is Gouken's younger brother and nemesis. Gouken greatly despises him for embracing the Satsui no Hado and murdering Goutetsu. Because of this, he does all he can to protect Ryu and Ken from him, to the point where he willingly fought Akuma in a battle to the death so that he won't come after them.Oni  Oni is the only being that has ever intimidated him, due to the demi-demon wielding fearsome power beyond imagination. It is implied Gouken knows very well this was what Akuma would become. By this time, Gouken considers his brother- or what he sees as formerly his brother, dead.Story Background  According to Capcom's official account of Akuma's backstory, the two brothers were once students of Goutetsu, a practitioner of an art that was originally developed with the intention of killing an opponent, the origins of which are rooted back to Japan's feudal age. Goutetsu taught his skills to Gouken and Akuma. Eventually, the two brothers began to differ in the methods and usage of their fighting style. Akuma became bent on completely mastering the killing and dark aspect of the art and embraced it to the point of succumbing to the Satsui no Hado, or \"Killing Intent\" and wanted to embrace it to his fullest extent to become more powerful. Gouken, on the other hand, developed his own style of the art and wanted to embrace the peaceful and spiritual aspect of the art by removing the Satsui no Hado: turning fatal techniques such as the Hadoken and Shoryuken into tools for self-defense, removing their killing potential. After succumbing to the Satsui no Hado, Akuma fought and murdered Goutetsu for not embracing it to his fullest extent and left behind both his master's dojo and his brother in order to train by himself to grow even more powerful. During this time period, Gouken founded his own dojo, and took Dan Hibiki as his first pupil. However, Gouken learned that the reason Dan wanted to learn this martial art was for revenge, and Gouken rejected him for his motives, fearing that his anger would lead him down a dark path as well as the fact Dan did not possess the skills necessary to learn from him. Later, Gouken found an abandoned orphan baby, Ryu, and took him under his wing. Ryu was joined by a second student, Ken Masters, who was sent from America by his father, a good friend of Gouken's, in order to learn humility and respect for a bright future. After Gouken began to train the two boys, Akuma made a sudden appearance at Gouken's dojo. There, Akuma challenged Gouken to a fight. Akuma was soundly defeated by his brother, but Gouken spared his life even after Akuma's insistence that Gouken should kill him. After Akuma's arrival and departure, Gouken continued to train the two boys. Eventually, time would pass, and as his students matured, Gouken found his two students graduating from his tutelage, adept enough to leave the dojo and travel the world to continue their studies to become better people. Afterwards, Akuma reappeared at Gouken's dojo and challenged his brother to a rematch. This time, Akuma ended up as the victor, supposedly killing him with the Shun Goku Satsu. However, because Gouken used a technique similar to Gen's and emptied his soul of emotions, he was merely left in a deep coma. Because he was unconscious for an extended period of time, Ryu and Ken believed their master to be dead, and put his body in a graveyard.Super Street Fighter IV  After awakening two years later, Gouken leaves his dojo and tailed his students, pleased that they have come so far. However, he was not satisfied with just watching them and he decided to enter the new S.I.N. tournament in order to test their strength himself. Gouken successfully finds Ryu after Seth's defeat, and managed to seal the Satsui no Hado so he would never have to suffer with this power again. Akuma appeared afterwards, furious at Gouken for completing this task; Akuma felt that he would no longer have a chance to kill Ryu in battle. Akuma realizes the power Gouken used to seal it was nothing ordinary, but the Power of Nothingness. The two brothers then face off in another rematch, with control of Ryu's fate as the prize, with Gen witnessing the beginning of the fight in awe. The exact outcome of this fight is unknown, though it is known that both survive and that Ryu does not go to Akuma. Afterwards, Ryu and Ken ask Gouken to stay with them a while, but Gouken tells them that they are both grown men and no longer need a master.Street Fighter V  In Ryu's character story, Gouken fights Ryu in a sparring match, training him to control the Satsui no Hado within him. The two of them are later confronted by Rashid and his servant, Azam, as the former wants to challenge Ryu to test his mettle. Gouken gives Ryu some advice as Ryu silently accepts Rashid's challenge.Gameplay Fighting style  As the preceding master of the martial art that Ryu and Ken practice and wield in the series, Gouken is nonetheless the originator and peerless practitioner of the toned down assassination martial art taught by Goutetsu. As seen in his moveset, Gouken has mastered the martial art to the point that he has grown to create techniques that better suit his own dynamics and philosophies, one that follows the use of both the Hado no Chikara and the Power of Nothingness for an effective and powerful form of self defense, rather than the violent and destructive form of the martial art that his brother wields with the Satsui no Hado. This is most significant in his repertoire's spelling and dynamics; many of their kanji are those with more benevolent and less wrathful interpretations than ones seen in Akuma's, and they are performed in such ways where they are intended for knockout stopping force than maiming and severe injury.Moveset  Gameplay-wise, Gouken's play style is representative of the martial arts concept of katsujinken (lit \"fist/sword that gives life\"), focusing on reading the opponent, being able to react and counter accordingly to their actions, and to react appropriately to an opponent's openings to unleash powerful attacks to the victory of the battle. Compared in metagame to Ryu and Ken, Gouken's play style is rather unorthodox when it comes to Shotokan style characters, lacking punishing anti airs and comboability. While a character of advanced and tricky disposition, he is nevertheless a powerful adversary in the hands of one who knows and can react quickly to the ins and outs of the game and with tools to immediately turn the tide back to their favor. Gouken is powerful enough to be capable of performing a Gohadoken with only one hand, is able to perform a similar Ashura Senku move, but with an offensive twist, the Senkugoshoha, has perfected an anti-aerial vertical Tatsumaki Senpukyaku, the Tatsumaki Gorasen, and has a powerful counter move, Kongoshin, that is able to counter nearly any attack with lightning fast oppressive force. Furthermore, he shares the Airborne Tatsumaki Senpukyaku of his students from the\u00a0Street Fighter II series and the Hyakkishu of his brother with a different variation, and shares his brother's Tenmakujinkyaku. His throw, Ama no Oroshi, is a simple subduing hug before Gouken tosses them into the air, and is useful for starting up aerial juggles. As the master of the toned down assassination art, Gouken appears to have specialized in the usage of the Shoryuken, to the point that they are only available as\u00a0Super Combos and Ultra Combos, in the forms of the Forbidden Shoryuken, while his first Ultra Combo is the Shin Shoryuken, and the Hadoken, as using both hands allows him to perform the Denjin Hadoken with a greater deal of power.As a Boss  His boss counterpart in Super Street Fighter IV, has powered up special moves quite similar to that of playable Gouken's EX moves and sports a light blue-green gi. Gouken's EX Senkugoshoha travels further, faster, and has Super Armor. The Gohadoken projectiles are immediately and fully charged, which means they always land two hits. The Denjin Hadoken is also fully charged upon activation. Gouken's normal counter can react to both high and low hits, eliminating the need to guess.Animations Street Fighter TV series  Gouken also appeared in the Street Fighter episode \"The World's Greatest Warrior\", with his character design being similar to that in prior Street Fighter manga.Street Fighter Alpha: The Animation  Gouken makes a cameo appearance in Ryu's flashback.Street Fighter Alpha: Generations  Gouken and Akuma are training together under Goutetsu's teachings, at some point, Akuma had turned to\u00a0the dark side to grow\u00a0in power and throwing away his humanity for the\u00a0Dark Hado after\u00a0murdering Goutetsu,\u00a0this event causes the two brothers's relationship to strain. At\u00a0some point, he takes in Ryu as a pupil along with Ken, and teaches them the art\u00a0of Ansatsuken, he is eventually\u00a0murdered by Akuma in front of Ryu who\u00a0tried to help\u00a0Gouken.Street Fighter IV: The Ties That Bind  Gouken is seen in Ryu's flashbacks.Live-action series Street Fighter: Assassin's Fist  Gouken appears along with Ryu and Ken in Street Fighter: Assassin's Fist portrayed by Akira Koieyama, and Shogen as young Gouken.Comics UDON comics  Although not exactly canon the comics have been influenced by the games and vice versa. Gouken's role in the UDON series is much the same as his in-game story as he teaches Ryu and Ken in the ways of Ansatsuken. During his younger days, Gouken committed himself to training after seeing his family murdered. The assailants were people who had a hatred for his father, who used the Dark Hado to murder the leader of the bandit gang's father. Gouken came to Goutetsu's temple after seeing his mother's life fade away from an unknown sickness, and Goutetsu agreed to teach him after hearing his reasons for learning Ansatsuken. After passing many trials and tests from Goutetsu's teachings, his final trial was to stay in the mountains with no food or water for days as a mental endurance test. Retsu reveals himself to Gouken and another student of Goutetsu that had stayed in the mountains and tells Gouken that he has been in the mountains for ten days and has reached enlightenment. He leads Gouken to the village of the bandits that murdered his father. Gouken, having no desire for revenge, did not go after them. He asked Retsu about the other student who was in the mountains with that lasted as long as he did. Retsu told him that it was his brother, Gouki. When the village and the bar was on fire due to the attack from Gouki under the influence of the Dark Hado, Gouken found a woman with an infant in the burning bar. He saved the baby from the place before it burned to the ground. Gouken then raised the boy as his son and named him Ryu. He teaches Ryu positive aspects of the art, sparing him from the darkness that would come from teaching him the full range of techniques (the side that embraces the Satsui no Had\u014d, or \"Dark Hado\"). He also would train the son of an American businessman, Ken Masters, much in the same way. At some point, he was visited by Retsu who told him the stories of what became of his brother. He told him Gouki has cast away his humanity and became Akuma. Many villagers and fighters feared Akuma and thought of him as a demon that was cast down from the heavens to destroy everything. After hearing about the people who had lost their lives to Akuma, Gouken sets out on a personal journey to find him near the river, only to find that he brother had truly become a demon after all. Telling Gouken that he would be better off alive if he went with Akuma, Gouken is enraged by Akuma a the two begin to engage in combat. After attack with a ki-charged Shoryuken, Akuma falls near a waterfall. Gouken wanted to save him from failing into the waterfall, but Akuma denies his help and drops in. He surveries the tital wave and climbs out of the river, revealing to Gouken his intention to one day fight against another person who uses the Dark Hado. Gouken maintains a different philosophy then that his brother, his brother believing that the only true path to mastery and perfection can only be gained by throwing away humanity, love, loyality, and compassion. Gouken believes that true mastery can be achive through goodness, peace, and honor, and this eventually leads the brothers to argue over the future of Ryu's destiny. Sometime after that event, Gouken was visited in the middle of the night at his dojo by another unwelcome visitor, whose aura was akin to that of a pure, threatening, empty shadow. Though he did not introduce himself, that entity was that of a younger M. Bison, and he demanded Gouken to show to him the techniques of Ansatsuken, having heard of its reputation through rumors and word of mouth. Forced to duel with the threatening figure, Gouken ultimately lost the fight, but won the battle, having held back and refusing to show Bison any of his techniques. However, Bison made word that he would one day encounter his two students, and ultimately reveal to him the secrets of Ansatsuken and its principles of Hadou; though beaten badly and fallen unconscious shortly afterwards, as if the events were nothing but a bad dream, Gouken knew irrevocably that his students would not be able to resist that fate of encountering Bison, and was driven to teach them to the best of his abilities in turn During Ryu's absence from the dojo to attend the first Street Fighter tournament, Akuma murders Gouken by using the Raging Demon, unaware that Gouken used the Power of Nothingness to protect his soul. As Akuma seeks to have Ryu embrace the Dark Hado for the remainder of the comic series, Gouken remained absent. Ryu forces himself to not show the hatred that wells up within him, adhering to his master's precepts of humanity and respect for one's opponent. However, Ryu also yearns to avenge Gouken's death and honor, and will seek out Akuma at any cost. This all comes to a head at the end of the Shadaloo tournment that Ryu is attending. Akuma intervenes before the final battle of the tournament between Ryu and Bison and destroys Bison's body so he may fight Ryu. The two clash but Akuma still overpowers Ryu. Before he can land the final blow, Gouken (using the Power of Nothingness) returns in time to save Ryu, expressing his pride, and engages a shocked Akuma. The two warriors battle to an unseen conclusion. Gouken told Akuma to give up his persuit on Ryu as he has shown that he is above the Dark Hado's evil. Akuma responds, stating that Ryu is not as pure as Gouken thinks. Akuma teleports to Sakura to prove his point. Shocked that Akuma would go this far to get to Ryu, Gouken told him to keep her out of this. Akuma then teleports away, leaving Gouken in the snow.Trivia Quotes  Gouken/QuotesGallery  Gouken/GallerySprites  Gouken/SpritesSee also References Super Street Fighter IV  Super Street Fighter IV (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30bf\u30fcIV, S\u016bp\u0101 Sutor\u012bto Fait\u0101 F\u014d) is a 2.5-dimensional fighting game, and is an update of Street Fighter IV.

He is a claw-wielding, narcissistic, Spanish ninja, obsessed with beauty and personal bodyguard to M. Bison.Biography Personality  Vega's character archetype is very familiar in Japanese manga and anime: the Narcissist (\u30ca\u30eb\u30b7\u30b9\u30c8, Narushisuto), often depicted as a long-haired, effeminate self-lover. Certain archetypal characters are comparable to Vega, elaborated on his pop culture page. Vega is vain, overconfident, and highly convinced of his own abilities, almost to the point of megalomania. He is also incredibly sadistic and takes great pleasure in seeing the ugly murdered, and preferably mutilated. He often has a stone-cold demeanor, and does not show a wide range of emotions. His narcissism and disdain for anything lacking elegance causes him to clash with fellow Shadaloo member Balrog due to the latter's boorish nature. Vega's vanity is demonstrated in how he uses his mask. He wears the mask not to conceal his identity, but to protect his face from scarring or bruising during battle, so that he can more easily view himself as perfect-looking. Vega often removes it after fights during his win poses, and his face is at least partially, if not fully, exposed in some of his character-select mugshots as well as some of his individual endings. Additionally, many characters are able to recognize Vega even if they never see him without his mask. In some games, he can remove the mask during battle. Vega's unbridled and solipsistic ego is shown even in his taste in interior decor, as his mansion is adorned with portraits, all of himself. Vega is also good at adopting elegant and gentlemanly mannerisms, likely because of his noble background. He has also been described as intelligent and sophisticated. Additionally, he is also attracted to and impressed by the beauty and strength of young women, notably Chun-Li and Cammy; he frequently compliments them on their appearances. At the same time, he seems to derive pleasure from causing pain and despair to both Chun-Li and Cammy, and even enjoys taunting them. With men, on the other hand, Vega tends to completely look down upon them and is seen constantly scolding their fighting abilities and \"ugliness\" in his win quotes, considering his looks and skills to be superior. He also harbors a tragic side. The family trauma he experienced molded his fragile mind to perceive physical unattractiveness not only as repulsive, but also as a threat. With his attractive mother murdered at the hands of his unattractive stepfather, ugliness came to represent evil and cowardice, while beauty represented heroism and strength. This also implies that Vega's hatred of anything \"ugly\" may actually be a manifestation of post-traumatic stress disorder. It has also been said that Vega's love of beauty is at least partially rooted in the way he was raised by his mother. In Super Street Fighter IV, Vega shows a small amount of respect for Guy in his Arcade Mode win quote, saying he expected better of him. While this is surprising considering his personality, it makes sense since both are masters of ninjutsu, and they are arguably the two most agile Street Fighter characters. Additionaly, some, if not all, of Vega's win quotes against other ninja fighters suggest that he judges them based on their skills and abilities with the art of ninjutsu (as well as their appearance).Etymology and name change  Vega is the 5th brightest star in the night sky, and the brightest star of its constellation, Lyra. Several of Vega's moves are named to reflect this, such as the Stardust Drop or Cosmic Heel. When Street Fighter II was localized in the United States, Capcom was afraid of a lawsuit from Mike Tyson over a character (Balrog) with his likeness as well as a similar sounding name (his Japanese name being \"Mike Bison\"). Additionally, when the designers presented the game to Capcom USA's marketing department, they believed that the name \"Vega\" did not fit the character it was given to. Vega is also a common Spanish surname. They decided to rotate the names of three of the four boss characters in the following manner:Appearance  Vega is a tall, strikingly handsome young man with long hair that is braided into a ponytail. His hair has switched between brown and blond through various Street Fighter media. In the Street Fighter II series, Vega's hair is colored brown in the sprites, but colored blond in his endings for the first two updates of the original Street Fighter II. The comics give him blond hair, as do Street Fighter Alpha 3 and Street Fighter V. In Street Fighter IV, Vega has brown hair in both the cutscenes and the gameplay. He wears murrey and yellow ceremonial trousers, a red sash, loafers, and white leggings of a matador, suggesting his involvement with bullfighting. This decorative garb offers matadors ease of movement, and is therefore ideal for Vega's acrobatic maneuvers. Vega also has a purple snake tattoo on his chest which circles his left arm, and on his right arm and both his wrists he wears gold-colored armlets. The tattoo shows him to be a villain to a Japanese audience, where body tattoos are usually worn by Yakuza members. In Capcom vs. SNK 2, as a win pose, Vega will hold his arm out, with the tattoo coming to life and hissing at the opponent. Early sketches suggest that Vega was going to resemble a medieval knight wearing a full suit of armor. This idea was scrapped, as Street Fighter was about fighters from all over the world, not from different time periods. There are a few remnants of this concept in Vega's final design, specifically a mask and a sharp metal claw. A similar type of weapon was used by Geki in the original Street Fighter, which has led to speculation that Vega received some training from Geki. [citation needed] Vega has a white mask that is lacking in facial features or expressions. It is difficult to tell how durable his mask is. On one hand, Vega is able to crush it to dust with one hand if he loses due to a time over in Street Fighter Alpha 3. On the other hand, it takes several hits before the mask falls off and, even then, he can easily pick up and reapply the mask, with no apparent lasting damage. Much like Sagat's eyepatch in earlier games, Vega's claw will always appear on whatever arm matches the direction he is facing (if he is looking to left side of the screen, it will appear on his left arm, and if he's looking right, it will be on his right) due to sprite mirroring. In the Street Fighter EX series, it will always be on his right arm. In Street Fighter IV, however, he changes his claw every time he switches sides, without mirroring; this can be seen in his tattoo, his accessories, and in the mark on his mask. Curiously enough, during the versus screen, his portrait won't be mirroring all the accessories either, with the unique exception of his claws. In Street Fighter V, Vega retains his traditional matador pants and red waist sash but is now wearing a partially opened white shirt. The purple snake tattoo that encircles his torso can still be partially seen. His alternate costume is an altered version of his outfit. The sleeves of his frill shirt are short and his signature mask is replaced with a golden opera mask. His blond hair is tied in a slick back in a ponytail with a long single fringe in the center of his head. His Halloween DLC costume has him wear a long red coat, a black formal suit with a white tie and black boots. He also wears white gloves and a magician hat on his head. While wearing this outfit, Vega can fight with or without his long coat.Character Relationships  Vega's criminal actions and general narcissism have made him many enemies.Allies Balrog  Balrog and Vega greatly despise each other, but are occasionally paired up to accomplish one of Shadaloo's goals. Balrog dislikes Vega for the latter's \"pretty boy\" persona; likewise, Vega dislikes Balrog for the latter's boorishness. Vega tends to annoy, tease and make fun of Balrog whenever he gets the chance.M. Bison  Vega and Bison have a simple professional relationship. Apart from the usual curious attitude, Vega does not have frictions with Bison. However, the assassin does not seem to be interested in helping the Shadaloo leader conquer the world. Whenever the organization is destroyed, Vega reverts to his old lifestyle, but will not hesitate to join again should it resurface.F.A.N.G  Although F.A.N.G initially seemed to show co-worker respect towards Vega, the latter thinks of him as an ugly and pathetic individual because of his deeds towards the improvement of Shadaloo Dolls. Because of this, F.A.N.G sees Vega as a \"contemptuous little bastard\".Rivals Juri  Juri sees Vega as a \"pervert\" due to his obsession with beauty, though this is quite hypocritical given her own interactions with other male fighters. Vega on the other hand appears to feel genuinely attracted to Juri's beauty and psychopathic tendencies, calling her the \"personification of evil beauty itself\" in his SSFIV win quote against her, though he dislikes her provocations, saying that she lacks \"delicacy\".Chun-Li  Vega enjoys mocking Chun-Li. In\u00a0SFIV\u00a0he calls Chun-Li a persistent wench and tries to play mind games with her by calling himself a ghost. In\u00a0SFV, he and Chun-Li battle off trying to learn more about her father but Vega escapes, he has even threatened to kill her.Cammy  Cammy hates Vega since he is a part of Shadaloo and is obsessive of her and her beauty (in one comic he is the one who scars her cheek). In Street Fighter Alpha 3, Cammy goes rogue, and Vega is sent by M. Bison to find her and to take her back to Shadaloo. When he finds her, he goes into a fight with her, calling her a \"guinea pig\", which confuses Cammy, unaware of the situation. Cammy wins and wonders what is going on and goes to M. Bison, who explains that she's a clone of him with his DNA. When she defeats him, he is killed and his original body disappears. When the Psycho Drive is blown up, she is near the explosion, but is saved by Vega; she doesn't know he saved her. He still shows interest in her in Street Fighter V, following her around during her character story and during A Shadow Falls. When the Shadaloo base blows up, he throws his mask into the explosion, possibly deciding to abandon her.\u00a0Story Early life  Vega was born to a privileged noble family in Spain. For reasons undisclosed, their status dwindled, causing Vega's mother to remarry for financial security. Growing up to the arts of hunting, later as he matured, Vega studied bullfighting, a cultural tradition, finding the sport more exciting and honorable in being able to dispatch his prey up close with his own might. Afterward, he went to Japan and learned ninjutsu, a style he believed meshed well with his natural grace and agility. Combining bullfighting with ninjutsu, Vega went into an underground cage fighting circuit, and quickly became one of the best. His ugly stepfather murdered his beautiful mother because he felt she did not respect him, and Vega killed him in return. The incident warped his mind, and he developed a dual personality: honorable nobleman by day, sadistic murderer by night. It also triggered Vega's obsession with beauty as a wonderful trait, as well as his belief that ugliness is something evil that should be purged.Street Fighter Alpha 3  Vega oversaw assassination operations for Shadaloo, and was associated with Cammy and the Shadaloo assassins known as the Dolls. When Cammy went rogue however, Vega was assigned to bring her in and although he failed in that mission, Cammy brought herself in and defeated M. Bison, freeing herself and the other Dolls from Bison's brainwashing. When the strain of undoing the brainwashing (as well as a dead-man's trigger in the brainwashing which was meant to kill them if they betrayed Bison) caused Cammy and the other Dolls to collapse, Vega saved them from the burning Shadaloo base because he didn't believe that anything as beautiful as them should die.Super Street Fighter II Turbo  Vega then participated in the second World Warrior tournament at the behest of Bison. However, when Bison was seemingly killed by an unknown assailant, Vega disappeared back into his old lifestyle.Super Street Fighter IV  It is unknown what Vega was doing since the fall of Shadaloo; he was rumored to have returned to bullfighting, and was believed by several people to be dead. However, Vega was alive, and a subdivision of Shadaloo called S.I.N. attempted to re-recruit him. Vega quickly accepted the subsidiary's offer, as he was intrigued at the idea of creating new bodies for oneself so as to be eternally young, and was otherwise tired of the aristocratic lifestyle, finding money and power to be an \"ugly\" combination. At S.I.N. HQ, while Seth was distracted by several assailants (not least of whom was a newly resurrected Bison), Vega stole valuable data on the project, and when Chun-Li did the same thing, he attempted to kill her by setting off the fire alarm, which released a toxic, fire-retardant spray. He escaped in a helicopter from the exploding base and noticed Chun-Li being rescued from the base along with her copy of the data. Mildly displeased that he did not have the only copy, Vega resolved to correct the situation later.Street Fighter V  On August 3rd, Vega was revealed to return in Street Fighter V. Vega is keeping tabs on the Dolls and thinks that F.A.N.G is foolish for making them loyally follow the commands of Shadaloo.Crossover appearances Cannon Spike  Vega appeared in Cannon Spike as a \"darker\" version of himself, called \"Fallen Balrog\" (the name Balrog being his original name in Japan).Capcom vs. SNK series  Vega appeared as a playable character in Capcom vs. SNK: Millennium Fight 2000, Capcom vs. SNK 2 and SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos. In Capcom vs. SNK 2, if he fights against a female opponent, the narcissist will introduce himself by throwing a rose at her, in appreciation of her beauty. He will do the same for other \"pretty-boy\" characters like Benimaru Nikaido (his SNK rival) and Rival Schools' Kyosuke Kagami, and strangely even M. Bison. When fighting against characters he considers \"ugly\" on the other hand (E. Honda, Raiden, Zangief, Blanka, Dhalsim and Chang Koehan), he shakes his head in disgust.Street Fighter X Tekken  In Street Fighter X Tekken, Vega is sent alongside Balrog to retrieve Pandora. However, the two despise each other and constantly bicker, yet they continue to work as team, if only in order to obtain Pandora for themselves. Their rivals are Yoshimitsu and Raven, who ambush them during their travels. Vega and Balrog's ending depicts Balrog attempting to open the box, but Vega has had enough of his co-worker's belligerence and decides to kill Balrog instead for possession of Pandora. Both become taken over by the influence of Pandora, and proceed to attack each other. After the credits roll, a post-ending shows Vega's fate:Street Fighter \u00d7 Mega Man  Vega is one of the four final bosses of Street Fighter \u00d7 Mega Man.Blood Brothers 2  Vega\u00a0appears in DeNA\u2019s mobile RPG, Blood Brothers 2.Shadowverse  Vega, Ryu, Chun-Li, M. Bison, Karin, Juri, and Cammy all appear as leaders for the classes in Shadowverse. Vega is an optional leader for Bloodcraft decks.Other appearances Street Fighter EX series Background  Vega became a high-ranking henchman for M. Bison in Shadaoo purely on the promise that he would be able to reap his special brand of torture with abandoned delight. Put in charge of Shadaloo's various assassination missions, Vega was never told how to do his job because Bison knew he relished every exquisite pain he inflicted on his targets, and he never failed to find and assassinate them in some artistic fashion. Bison always admired Vega's creativity, but he valued Vega's loyalty even more. When it turned out that someone dared to sponsor the second Street Fighter EX tournament in Bison's place, he suspected that it might actually be a trap to lure Bison out into the open, having narrowly escaped capture by the US Air Force and Interpol at the end of the last tournament. Bison sent Vega ahead to scout the situation out, which Vega was only too happy to do, although he wasn't thrilled about being sent to the tournament with an ugly brute like Cracker Jack. When Vega arrived, he did some research and noted a lot of interesting connections between some of the contestants. Many were long time companions, and some were even family members. He happened to be pit in a match with the beautiful Hokuto. Prizing beauty above everything else, Vega felt that Hokuto was a very worthy opponent for himself. He noticed as he began to fight her that she was struggling with something inside her mind. It became a game to Vega to force Hokuto's focus off whatever she was concerned with holding back. He used his claws to inflict painful slashes along Hokuto's body. Eventually, Vega succeeded in breaking Hokuto's concentration and she was driven mad by a special kind of darkness that consumed her. Knowing that Hokuto was scheduled to fight against the very man she came to the competition with, Vega thought how delightful it would be to watch one friend be struck down by this possessed woman. He threw the match, and allowed Hokuto to advance. Vega relished every moment of the next fight between Hokuto and her lover; the look on his face when he realized she didn't recognize him, the final strike when she inflicted a mortal wound on him, and the look of horror on her face when she woke up and realized what she had done. It could only have been better if Vega had killed the man himself. His work done, he reported to M. Bison everything he had learned and let him take it from there. Vega joined the third tournament as M. Bison's partner, although he was instructed by Bison to perform several covert spying operations for him, to learn more about Shadowgeist and other potential threats to Bison's life.Endings Street Fighter EX2  The spectators had their breath taken away by his appearance... Vega, the seeker of ultimate beauty who interwined blood and madness.\nDespite fighting several new fighters, these matches were nothing more than farces that favored him .\n\"The ugly ones are to be vanquished... The filthy ones are the spoils... Recognize that your only usefullness in life is to be preyed upon by my claw.\"\nToday, Vega's loud shout echoes inside the battle arena.Street Fighter EX2 Plus  Vega administered \"SH-11\", a new experimental drug stolen from Shadaloo, unto himself. But instead of achieving \"ultra-beauty\", the ultimate in strength and beauty, his own mind and pride became ugly distortions.Street Fighter EX3  Suddenly, it began to rain. The cold rain began to hit Vega's maks. Something warm and inviting began to grow inside of Vega. It was like he was actually beginning to feel human emoctions again. From the edge of the cliff, he tried to throw his mask away, but... He couldn't release the mask from his hand. The cry from his soul is lost in the hard...Animations Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie  Vega appeared in the animated film adaptation of Street Fighter II. Like in the game, Vega is an antagonist serving under M. Bison alongside Balrog and Sagat. As Interpol's pursuit of Shadaloo intensifies, M. Bison dispatches Vega to assassinate Chun-Li. He hides in Chun-Li's apartment while she showers, proceeding to ambush her as she sits in her bedroom drying her hair. Though Chun-Li proves to be a formidable opponent, Vega has the upper hand for much of the fight. He sadistically comments on his desire to skin Chun-Li 'like a rabbit', alive, before slowly licking some of her spilt blood from the third blade of his claw. He indicates this is made more pleasurable when the object of his psychopathic desire is as he puts it, 'cute'. Chun-Li responds by catching Vega off guard,\u00a0knocking him to the ground by throwing a couch at him and hitting him with a\u00a0Spinning Bird Kick, before stamping on his face, badly damaging and possibly permanently ruining his left eye. Horrified by the damage dealt to his face, Vega goes ballistic. After a vicious and brutal fight, Chun-Li succeeds in kicking\u00a0Vega through the wall of her apartment after pummeling him good, and sends him plummeting several stories into the darkness of the alley below. It is unknown whether he survives or not, but despite his defeat, Vega's attack takes its toll on Chun-Li, leaving her\u00a0comatose from blood loss\u00a0for the rest of the movie. Disgusted with Vega's failure, M. Bison dispatches Sagat to find Vega and, should he remain alive, finish him.Street Fighter II V  Vega appears as an amorous bullfighter who falls in love with and tries to seduce Chun-Li. Envious and jealous over Ryu and\u00a0Ken's friendship with Chun-Li (especially Ken), Vega invites the three to a party in his castle, which is actually a trap to lure Ryu and Ken to a caged death match with him whom he sees as rivals for her affections. Since Ryu does not attend the party, he subsequently fights only Ken, and is finally defeated after a brutal match. His full name is given as Vega Fabio la Cerda (\u30d0\u30eb\u30ed\u30b0\u30fb\u30d5\u30a1\u30d3\u30aa\u30fb\u30e9\u30fb\u30bb\u30eb\u30c0, Barurogu Fabio ra Seruda) in the series, and is stated to be part of the famous la Cerda family. In the Castilian Spanish dub, his full name is instead Fabio Antonio de la Vega.Street Fighter Alpha: The Animation  Vega made a cameo appearance, briefly shown brutalizing his opponent, Dan, during a fighting tournament.Street Fighter cartoon  Vega is similar to his movie counter part, and appears in two episodes: \"Eye of the Beholder\" and \"Face of Fury\". He is introduced as a former henchman of Bison who was promised eternal youth, and develops a rivalry with Blanka. Vega attempted to capture a young lady in Brazil, but his attempt was stopped by Blanka, enraging him and causing the two to fight. As Blanka wins and prepares to finish off Vega, the lady pleaded for him to stop, allowing Vega to walk away into the shadows.Street Fighter IV: The Ties That Bind  Vega makes a small appearance near the end, when he is seen along with Balrog in a Shadaloo helicopter. As a heavily injured Seth drags himself aboard, he gives him a message from Bison, telling him that while he \"put on a fantastic show\", S.I.N.'s success has only come through the manipulation of Shadaloo working behind the scenes to ensure their good fortune.Live-action films 1994 film  In this movie, Vega (portrayed by Jay Tavare) is the loyal assistant of Sagat, and fight Ryu in a cage match. The match is spectacularly interrupted by Guile, who arrests him, Sagat, Ryu, Ken and the majority of the audience; however, the four of them manage to escape from jail. Later, he and Ryu clash again, and find themselves evenly matched; Ryu tips the scales in his favor by burning Vega's face on an oven. Vega has few lines in the film and only speaks them when he is masked or offscreen. Despite being masked all the time, his face can be seen in some scenes.Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li  Vega (played by Taboo of Black Eyed Peas) appears in the film as a minor antagonist. He is hired by Bison to assassinate Chun-Li. He and Chun-Li engage in a fight wherein the latter gains the upper hand and defeats him; Vega hanging from the side of a building. The movie depicts Vega dressed in black from head to toe and although he retains his claw and mask, the only exception is that the mask is made of metal. Vega wore the mask to conceal his true identity rather than protect his face.Future Cops  In this live stage play, Vega is portrayed as a good guy named Ti Man. He is a member of the future cops and is a part of the group that goes back in time to protect Tai-Hung/Yu Ti Hung from being assassinated and prevent him from becoming president. He pretends to be a fellow student while striking up a romance with Tai Hung's sister Chun May (Chun Li).Matador  A gritty drama film focusing on Vega and the details behind his traumatic upbringing as well as the pivotal sequence of events that made him into the assassin he is today.Comics Udon series  In Vol. 1, Vega is a high ranking member of Shadaloo appointed to find Ryu. He goes to Japan based on Killer Bee's information and after a fight with E. Honda, runs into Ken and Eliza. Vega places a tracking device on a scarf Eliza had bought and later uses that to find her and break into her hotel room to interrogate her about Ryu's location. Ken arrives on the scene and fights Vega. Vega is mildly scarred when Ken kicks him through the window and escapes. In Vol. 2, Vega meets Balrog in the US after the latter told him he had seen Ken and Eliza at his boxing match and plots to have his revenge from the fight he had with Ken. Vega finds where Ken and Eliza are having a party and crashes it with Balrog and several other people. Vega fights Ken again and nearly kills him until Guile intervenes. Guile keeps Vega occupied long enough until the cops show up, but Vega once again escapes when the explosives he had set up cause the lights to go out. Vega has a brief appearance in Vol. 3, where he sends invitations for Shadaloo's World Warrior Tournament. In Vol. 4, Vega makes another brief appearance where it is discovered that (in this series) he was the one who gave Cammy her signature scar after a fight and installed the memory algorithm delete program that helped get rid of Shadaloo's influence on her. In Vol. 5, after Cammy is captured by Shadaloo and brainwashed again Vega reactivates the algorithm, once again giving her back her mind. He later saves her from Decapre and goes to Japan to hold the qualifier for the Tournament there, where he recruits Zangief, E. Honda and Sakura, who does not participate. In Vol. 6, Vega fights Ken in the World Warrior Tournament, and appears to have an advantage for most of the fight. After a move exposes the letter Eliza wrote Ken (which told him they were having a son) Ken performs his Shinryuken and Vega loses the match. His face bruised and in worse condition than their first fight, Vega goes ballistic and attempts to kill Ken. E. Honda intervenes and Vega is knocked out. After Bison's death and the destruction of Shadaloo Island, Vega returns to his old ways organizing cage matches and sadistically butchering his opponents. However, because of his vanity Interpol no longer perceives him as a threat, but they still keep tabs on him. In the new comics Street Fighter Unlimited, Vega kidnaps Chun-Li and he has several Twelve soldiers as clones of himself, who attacks Cammy, Guile, and Alex.Gameplay Fighting style  Vega's fighting style, officially refered as \"Spanish Ninjutsu\", is a blend of ninjutsu and bullfighting, thus earning him the nickname \"Spanish Ninja\".Moveset  Vega is one of the fastest and most agile characters in the Street Fighter series, but also one of the most delicate; his defensive rating is low compared to most of the other characters to balance his incredible speed. Vega is also one of the few weapon users in the series, and the only one that appears in the Street Fighter II series. Vega's overall style uses a mix of a keepaway game and quick lunges at the opponent. Vega has a powerful air game based on his Flying Barcelona Attack and Sky High Claw, and is more than agile enough to get around the opponent's attacks and strike with rapid succession, leading to potentially devastating setups, confusing cross-ups, or long-range poking attacks with the reach advantage provided by his claw. However, his long reach can easily be beaten out with a counterattack at the right moment, and could leave Vega helpless to an aggressive opponent; most of Vega's moves are hard to maintain a position with, and are not too safe on block. In addition to various airborne attacks, Vega is equipped with low ground attacks such as the Scarlet Terror and Rolling Crystal Flash that can be used to keep the foe off-balance, and he can use long and short Back Slashes to backflip around attacks. In Street Fighter V, Vega is no longer a charge character, making nearly all of his moves easier to pull off.Claw and mask mechanics  It takes exactly fourteen blocked hits for Vega to lose his claw. This reduces his attack range (and sometimes power) significantly, and prevents him from using certain Super Combos. Since Super Street Fighter II Turbo, Vega is able to retrieve the claw; in Street Fighter Alpha 3, he can lose his mask as well, though the effect is only cosmetic there. In SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos, Vega cannot lose his claw. In the Street Fighter EX series, Vega may reinforce or recover his claw with a Super Combo. In the Street Fighter IV series, Vega can throw his claw off as a special taunt. He can also throw his mask, at the cost of two bars of the Super Combo Gauge, to increase his attack power by 25% (damage scaling is still accounted for, however). If Vega wins a fight without his mask on, it is revealed that he sticks his tongue out to either lick his claw or taunt his fallen opponent. In Street Fighter V, Vega has access to two distinct fighting styles; clawed or barehanded, and he can choose to sheathe or unsheathe his claw at any point during battle. Barehanded, Vega gains access to a command grab, and vastly different attack properties. In a drastic change from previous recent appearances, once Vega's claw is knocked off, it cannot be picked back up. Depending on the chosen fighting style, possible combos are different. Overall, sheathing the claw is trading range for more combo potential. In Street Fighter V, the claw does not seem to increase damage Vega deals and therefore only provides him extra range for most of his attacks. However, a few of his moves attacks have increased damage with claw on to make up for loss of combo potential (FBA for example, which knocks the opponent down with claw on, denying any combo option). In Street Fighter V, Vega loses his mask after losing around 80 - 85\u00a0% of his health bar. He has a slight increase in damage after losing the mask, but does not seem to have a defense penalty like in previous games.Quotes  See Vega/Quotes.Pop Culture  Vega/Pop CultureTrivia Gallery  Vega/GallerySee also References Street Fighter \u00d7 Tekken  Street Fighter \u00d7 Tekken (\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc \u00d7 \u9244\u62f3, Sutor\u012bto Fait\u0101 Kurosu Tekken, pronounced Street Fighter Cross Tekken) is a crossver fighting game featuring characters from both the Street Fighter series and the Tekken series of 3D fighting games, released on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PC, iOS, and PlayStation Vita. The game is one of a pair of games, with the other being Tekken \u00d7 Street Fighter, in development by Bandai Namco.Street Fighter Tekken uses Street Fighter IV's\u00a0engine; Tekken \u00d7 Street Fighter, on the other hand, will be using Tekken's engine.Gameplay  The game uses a modified Street Fighter IV engine. Gameplay is focused on \"Tag Team combat where players select two fighters to deliver knockout assist attacks and special combos\". The KO system works similarly to Tekken Tag Tournament, where the fight ends when one member of the team has been knocked out. There is also a \"Customize Color\" option and \"Scramble Mode\" battle, where all four chosen characters battle at the same time in their respective teams, reminiscent of the Street Fighter Alpha Dramatic Battles. A new feature is the \"Pandora\" mode, where players can relinquish their partner in order to gain a temporary surge in power. As seen in the trailers, this new mode also ties in to the game's story. Another new feature is the Gem System, where players can add up to three gems to their character in order to enhance their abilities and stats. Most gems are immediately in effect, though some gems will only take effect when certain conditions are met on the battlefield alone. Several other gameplay features are added, including: Color Edit, which was last seen in Capcom vs. SNK 2, has also returned; players are able to color skin, hair, and all layers of clothes, starting with very few colors but being able to download more via the Store.Story  The main story of the game revolves around a strange, cubical object that crash-landed on Earth, somewhere in Antarctica. Nobody knows exactly what the object is, where it came from or what purpose it has, only that it appears to release a powerful energy when beings come into conflict around it. As a result, researchers nickname the strange box \"Pandora\". Several characters from the Tekken and Street Fighter universes form teams of two and search for Pandora, each with their own motivations.Characters  These are the characters that make an appearance in Street Fighter \u00d7 Tekken:Street Fighter Tekken  \u00a0Downloadable characters \u00a0Playable on the\u00a0iOS editionGuest characters (PS3/Vita exclusive) Cameos  The following characters, while not playable, appear or are referred to in various trailers, stages, etc.Street Fighter Tekken Stage Cameos Stages Downloadable Content Swap Costumes  DLC costumes, called \"Swap Costumes\",\u00a0were announced; Street Fighter Swap Costumes are Tekken-inspired, and Tekken Swap Costumes are Street Fighter-inspired.Alternate Costumes  Also present are \"Alternate Costumes\", which see fighters don the costumes of characters from their own series, as well as some-all new outfits.Development  Prior to tournament EVO 2010 at Las Vegas, Nevada, Street Fighter producer Yoshinori Ono was teasing a yet to be announced game which was initially believed to be a new Darkstalkers entry. Before EVO 2010's Super Street Fighter IV finals, Ono was confronted by Tekken producer Katsuhiro Harada on stage after teasing more of the game that would officially be announced at the 2010 Comic-Con. During the Super Street Fighter IV panel at Comic-Con, Harada appeared out of the crowd and went towards the stage while handing out free copies of Tekken 6, which was met with cheers and boos. Ono and Harada then confirmed the existence of Street Fighter \u00d7 Tekken. Both the teaser trailer and early gaming footage of Street Fighter \u00d7 Tekken was also shown at Comic-Con. During the announcement, Harada also revealed that he has a related project under way, which is being developed by Namco and which the gameplay will be similar to that of Tekken. Other Capcom games are referenced in Street Fighter \u00d7 Tekken, such as Dino Crisis, which has a stage based around one of its levels. The PC port of Street Fighter \u00d7 Tekken was developed by Polish studio QLoc. A portable version of the game was announced for the PlayStation Vita at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2011. Downloadable content is cross-compatible between both the PlayStation 3 and Vita versions of the game. Nathan Drake from Naughty Dog's Uncharted series was considered for inclusion as a guest character, but the idea was scrapped during development. Yoshinori Ono stated that there is no exclusive character for the Xbox 360 version, stating: \"We do have the exclusive characters for the Sony platform. We have Cole, the two Sony cats, Kuro and Toro. But basically for the Xbox 360, we were in discussions with them (Microsoft) for which character to put in as an exclusive, but we weren't able to decide on a character because of differences in timing and things like that\".Music  The music featured in cinematic trailers included \"Honest Eyes\" by Black Tide, \"Knock Me Out\" by Street Drum Corps, \"In Love With You\" by Jared Evan, \"My Town\" by Hollywood Undead, and \"From Heads Unworthy\" by Rise Against.Release  Capcom senior VP Christian Svensson stated that there would be no North American retail release for the PC version and that it would instead be sold digitally through Steam. However, Asia and Europe would receive a retail box release of the PC version. Ono stated that the reason is because he does not want an on-disc DLC for the PC version, out of fear that hackers may create mods to crack the game and access the DLC.Special Edition  The Special Edition features a \"build-it-yourself arcade cabinet bank\" (approximately five inches high), prequel comic book by UDON and 36 gems, which includes all pre-order DLC packs (\"World Warrior\", \"Iron Curtain\" and \"Lightning Legs\") plus an exclusive Special Edition DLC pack (\"King of Iron Fist\"). The Special Edition also comes with nine exclusive gems (\"Cross Arts\" DLC) only available as a pre-order bonus for the edition, making it total of 45 gems if the edition is pre-ordered. The Collectors Edition features the \"World Warrior\" DLC, which includes nine gems, all of which provide characters with different attributes and properties. Also included is a 46 track original soundtrack spanning two discs and a 44-page art book. In the Asian market the special edition includes DLC for a complete pack of gems, a two-disc soundtrack, 41 character cards with art on one side and move details on the other, and Bobble Budds bobble heads modeled after Street Fighter producer Yoshinori Ono and Tekken producer Katsuhiro Harada. The three big game retailers in Australia, EB Games, JB Hi-Fi and Game shared three pre-order bonuses. EB Games offers the exclusive Special Edition, JB Hi-Fi offered the standard edition, along with a 60\u00a0cm \u00d7 90\u00a0cm wall scroll featuring Ryu and Kazuya Mishima, while Game offered the standard edition bundled with a Kazuya and Ken T-shirt.Reception  Both console versions of Street Fighter \u00d7 Tekken received positive reviews from most critics, with praise going to the game's modes and tag team gameplay. The PlayStation Vita version however received lesser reviews than its console counterparts, being criticized for the graphics, long loading times, clunky controls and \"poor competitive balance\".Controversy  The most complaints Street Fighter \u00d7 Tekken recieved was the inclusion of characters on the disc that can only be used by paying more, this resulted in heavy criticism by fans and publishers as gamers would pay an additional amount of money for something that was completed before release and on disc. Capcom responded stating they intended to add the characters locked in the retail versions to save hard drive space but the respone was only met with more criticism. The game's DLC scandal led to many online debates and articles about on-disc DLC, and the controversy of game developers having buyers paying more than neccessary for something that is already completed, in the gaming industry. Other subjects of criticism were missing fan favorites in the playable cast, certain aspect of the game mechanics (such as the Gem System which was met with mixed respones) and that online tag-team matches are not available for the Xbox 360 version of the game although the feature was advertised and printed in the manual. Capcom stated this would not be fixed with a patch.Sales  By two months after its release, Street Fighter \u00d7 Tekken sold over 1 million copies. However, this was about 40% short of Capcom's expectations. Initially, as of March 31, 2012, Street Fighter \u00d7 Tekken had sold 1.4 million units worldwide, in contrast to Capcom's expectations that it would sell 2 million units (though sales have since continued to rise to 1.7 million as of March 31, 2014). Capcom believed that the game's poor performance may be in part due to \"cannibalism\" of the fighting game genre, meaning too many fighting games were released in too short a time. The PlayStation 3 version got to number 3 in the UK physical sales charts. The PlayStation Vita version received a lukewarm response, selling only 5,420 copies during its first week in Japan. However, in May 2017, following the release of Tekken 7, this version of the game topped the European download chart.References See also External Links Guile  Guile (\u30ac\u30a4\u30eb, Gairu) is a video game character from the Street Fighter series, first appearing in Street Fighter II. He is a major in the United States Air Force whose goal is to finish the criminal organization Shadaloo, while at the same time investigating the whereabouts of his best friend Charlie Nash.Biography Appearance  Early Street Fighter II sketches and notes suggest that Guile was developed specifically to appeal to American fans. His physical appearance is strikingly different from the many Asian characters in the Street Fighter series, with light blue eyes (green in Street Fighter V) without eyebrows, a chiseled jaw, a permanent expression of bad mood on the face, and his most recognizable feature: a particularly tall flattop haircut. The length of Guile's hair varies greatly from appearance to appearance; it is relatively realistic in Street Fighter II, and impossibly tall in SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos. Capcom source books suggest that Guile's famous hairdo is styled with a special-order army hair spray to keep it up (though he ends up fixing it quickly after a match). Guile's all-American image includes military fatigues and United States flag tattoos on each shoulder; following standard United States military protocol, the stars are on the left hand side to give the illusion that the flag is flying 'towards' battle. The image of the uniformed American Airman is well known in Japan due to the number of United States Armed Forces bases present in that country. Guile wears Charlie's dog tag alongside his own; in Street Fighter IV, one of Guile's alternate costumes resembles Charlie's costume. In Street Fighter V, Guile wears a white military button shirt with dark blue emblems in each sides, a matching dark blue tie on the collar with 'US' emblems in each sides, dark blue military pants with a black belt on his waist and black combat shoes. He wears his signature sports sunglasses as part of his default costume and wears a blue ID with his imprinted full name on the right side and a gold eagle badge on the left. His first alternate costume is his classic attire in Street Fighter II and his second costume has him wearing a brown flak vest with a blue gray army jumpsuit with the sleeves are rolled up into cuffs and a white undershirt. He maintains wearing his sports sunglasses and black combat shoes from his primary outfit and wears Charlie's dogtag and his black watch from his primary outfit.Personality  Guile is a tough man, both physically and mentally, who takes pride in family, and is a loving husband and father to his family. A stoic man at heart, Guile's calm and emotionless exterior actually hides intense feelings, especially the fury after Charlie's death. Although loyal to the Air Force and the United States, Guile is extremely persistent. He always seeks to get the bottom of the matter, especially concerning Shadaloo, M. Bison and what happened with Charlie Nash, which has led to problems with his superiors (although they have high respect and esteem to him) and has caused pain to his family, this hurts him deeply. In Street Fighter X Tekken, it is revealed that he is scared of bears, while he states in his win quote toward Dee Jay in Super Street Fighter IV that he only likes country music. In Street Fighter V, Guile is shown to be a stoic and very focused person, always giving advice to others including Abel about recklessness, bravery and the will to survive the battlefield. He is also seen to be happy when he and Charlie are having a sparring match after both ends up in a draw. However at the present day during the game's story, his friendship with Charlie was damaged when Guile was overpowered by Charlie in the fight.Concept  In an interview with producer Noritaka Funamizu, he reveals that Guile's overall appearance was modeled after Jean Pierre Polnareff, a character from the manga series JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. Guile's page in Street Fighter X Tekken Artworks goes into detail, explaining that early designs included Polnareff's vertical, yet modest hairstyle, but at the time the sprites were being made for Street Fighter II, the pixel artist jokingly stretched Guile's hair out to the sides. The team found it amusing and decided to give him \"the always distinctive Stroheim look\" instead. Noritaka also explains that Guile's name was derived from Polnareff's archenemy, J.Geil, though this was apparently the result of a mix up from the development staff at the time.Character relationships Allies Ryu  Although they do not have such a close relationship, they are friends and have great respect as fighters and people. As an anecdote, Ryu invited him to eat Natto once, and when he tasted it (out of respect) he actually found it disgusting, becoming his most hated food since then, to which Ryu seems to know about, according to one of his win quote towards the former.Ken Masters  Guile gets along well with his brother-in-law, even though he doesn't like Ken's personality, as seen in various winquotes, most evident in SvC Chaos, as per their intro quotes. Ken goes as far as inviting him and his family in SFIV to see his then-about-to-be-born son, and even help him out about his bad hair day.Charlie Nash  Charlie is Guile's superior officer and close friend. Charlie is also the one who taught Guile his current fighting style. He also greatly values Guile; in order to save him and Chun-Li, he sacrificed his own life in a vain effort to end Bison. Despite his warped mental state in Street Fighter V, it is implied that he still sees Guile as a close friend. However, based on both their win quotes against each other, Charlie's change seems to mar their friendship, as Charlie states that he has nothing more to say to him about his revival. This also shows in the game's cinematic story mode, in which Helen instructs him to take a special chess piece from Guile to help him stop Shadaloo. Despite his shock at being told to fight Guile, he later confronts Guile as well as Chun-Li and Cammy coldly without a single word, as the former tells the two to stay back as they fight. Charlie manages to overpower Guile, who still doesn't fully believe this is actually him due to his stitched-together appearance and detached ruthless demeanor. However, in later scenes, the two rekindle their friendship and values after Guile rescues him from being chased from Necalli. At the end of A Shadow Falls, he watches with sadness the Shadaloo base collapse, and with it, what appears to be the second and certain death of his best friend.Abel  When the two first met, Abel, having watched Guile practice his Sonic Boom, asked how Guile could perform it. Knowing that only he and his mentor, Charlie, could do it, Guile asked Abel where he first saw it. Thinking that Guile is a spy (from Guile's POV) he said that he wouldn't tell someone he doesn't know his secrets (from Abel's POV) and refuses to talk, thus the two fight. The result is unknown, but since Abel later shows Guile, Chun-Li and Cammy to the S.I.N base later in the story, it is presumed that either Guile won or that Chun-Li persuaded Abel to take them. In Street Fighter V, Guile already considers Abel as a friend. They both work together and Guile advises and guides him on how to act.Cammy White  Cammy and Guile are good friends and usually team up together with Chun-Li to do missions (mostly involving Shadaloo). Closer to the end of Street Fighter IV: The Ties That Bind, a bandaged Cammy is seen with Guile, implying that he was the one overseeing her recovery.Chun Li  His longtime friend and partner. Despite their opposite attitudes (apparently) they are very similar in their way of thinking and seeing life.Dhalsim  Guile is on good terms with Dhalsim, likely due, in part, to their children's closeness.Enemies M. Bison  Guile despises Bison for his crimes against humanity and has largely held him responsible for the demise of his friend Charlie.Kolin  Because Guile reminded her of soldiers that wrought havoc in her homeland, Kolin does not have a favorable view about Guile due to his occupation, and the same would be true for Charlie Nash, except that the latter is now under her and Illuminati's command.Seth  Due to his atrocious plans, Guile views Seth as no different from Bison and wants to arrest him for it.Doctrine Dark  A former subordinate of his, D. Dark blames Guile for what happened to him and his unit and seeks revenge.Story Background  When Guile was a trainee in the United States Air Force, he befriended his superior officer, Charlie Nash and asked him to teach him in his unique form of fighting, which Charlie agreed to do. Guile learned the style, but his hot temper caused him to lack proficiency in the moves (shown in how Charlie can shoot Sonic Booms with one hand, while Guile needs both).Street Fighter Alpha 3  In the Street Fighter continuity, Guile was not introduced to the series until the events of Street Fighter Alpha 3, where he is addressed as \"Commander\". Guile is sent by the United States Air Force to look for his senior teammate and best friend Charlie, who has gone missing during a secret investigation. Guile's search eventually leads him to the Interpol investigator Chun-Li, who warns him not to follow Charlie due to the danger involved. Guile demonstrates his fighting ability, and assures Chun-Li that he will not let their friend come to harm. He eventually finds the Shadaloo base in Thailand. Guile informs Charlie that they do not need to be there any longer, as an aerial bombardment will begin in an hour. Charlie, however, insists that Shadaloo leader M. Bison will escape, and they come to blows. The sinister and powerful M. Bison appears and attacks the two Airmen, but is no match for their combined prowess. He is forced to retreat, calling a gunship to keep them pinned down and cover his escape. The two give chase, and follow him into the base, deciding that M. Bison's source of power, the Psycho Drive must be destroyed. Chun-Li then appears and informs them that the bombardment has been called off, surmising that Bison has somehow used his influence. She goes on to tell them that she has set explosives in an attempt to destroy the base, but is unsure if they'll be enough. As she rushes to escape, Charlie and Guile decide to set explosives around the Psycho Drive to ensure that if nothing else, it at least will be destroyed. As they set their charges, M. Bison fought with Ryu and his allies in an epic battle. In the end, Ryu defeated him, destroying his body temporarily and forcing M. Bison to regenerate in the Psycho Drive. Bison successfully regenerated his body then Charlie convinces Guile to escape while he holds Bison off, and Guile escaped right before the base explodes, with Charlie and Bison presumably caught in the blast. Chun-Li and Ryu eventually find Guile standing on a mountain, and Chun-Li says that Charlie may perhaps be alive somewhere, just as she believes that her father may be. Guile agrees, and says that he will continue to believe in Charlie.Street Fighter II  Holding Bison responsible for the death of his best friend, Guile was eager to take revenge on M. Bison, who has somehow survived the explosion. A court case against the Shadaloo dictator fails when Bison bribes all the judges to let him go free. Bison by this time wants revenge on Guile, Chun-Li, and many other people who had hindered his syndicate's efforts. To this end, he sets up the second World Warrior tournament to trap them, among other reasons. Guile, for his part, takes the bait, deserting his wife and daughter to pursue the vendetta. Guile's ending in HD Remix and Ultra depicts him having Bison at his mercy and reminding him of Charlie. Bison shows no regret and taunts Guile to kill him. Guile hesitates, but ultimately refuses to kill Bison, stating he is not a murderer like Bison. Guile visits Charlie's grave three days later, saying that he knows now that revenge will not bring Charlie back and says that his obsession for revenge consumed Guile and destroyed his family. This monologue is interrupted by arrival of his wife, Julia (called Jane in SFII series) and daughter, Amy, who persuade him to come back home. Guile hesitates on this, but then embraces Julia, determined to be the best husband and father he can be. In the games prior to HD Remix and Ultra, Guile's hesitation to kill Bison in his ending is instead interrupted by the arrival of Julia and Amy, who then persuade him to give up on his revenge and return home. Guile, refusing to become a murderer like Bison, concludes that he feels like he's waking up from a long nightmare and returns to his family.Pre-Super Street Fighter IV  Some time after the fall of Shadaloo, Chun-Li, Guile and Cammy are summoned to a theme park to stop the rampage of S.I.N. operative Juri, who is wreaking extreme havoc. While Guile and Cammy try to evacuate the civilians still trapped, Chun-Li faces Juri just as she executes a rogue S.I.N agent and a woman. Juri seriously injures Chun-Li but before she can execute her, she is forced to flee when Guile and Cammy arrive due to her artificial eye malfunctioning. Guile and Cammy later act on anonymous intelligence and track Juri down to an old Shadaloo base which houses the former twelve Dolls. When they arrived, Juri had already defeated all twelve dolls and had just finished off Juli and Juni. A fierce fight ensues and Guile is eventually heavily incapitated by Juri, leaving Cammy to face her alone. Guile later informs Chun-Li about their failure to apprehend Juri.Street Fighter IV  Though Shadaloo is seemingly gone, Guile still believes it possible that Charlie may be alive since Charlie's body was never recovered. Guile demands of his superiors to allow him to continue the search. His commanding officer refuses, and Guile tenders his resignation. Guile is surprised when his superior ignores the resignation, assigning Guile to the investigation of S.I.N., an organization with alleged ties to Shadaloo. Guile is at first incredulous that Shadaloo lives on without Bison, but soon takes to his new assignment with zeal. Recruiting Chun-Li to the investigation, the two enter a new tournament organized by S.I.N., in the hopes of infiltrating its headquarters. Over the course of the tournament he encounters a mysterious French fighter named Abel, who seems to recognize Guile's Sonic Boom attack. Since only he and Charlie know this attack, Guile comes to the conclusion that Abel has information on Charlie's ultimate fate, and immediately starts pressing him for answers on where he saw the Sonic Boom before. Abel is completely unwilling to share such sensitive information with a stranger who could easily be a spy, and they exchange blows. It is currently unknown who won the fight, but it is implied that Guile won, as Abel is later seen travelling with Guile and Chun-Li to the S.I.N base, meaning Abel may have led them there. Later, in the S.I.N. headquarters, Guile recovers important data while Chun-Li is trapped by Vega, with the base's self-destruction imminent. En route to rescuing Chun-Li, Guile is ambushed by one of Bison's cyborgs (in the same mold as Seth). Abel arrives and takes on the cyborg instead, telling Guile where Chun-Li is and telling him to hurry. Exactly how Chun-Li is then rescued is unclear - Gen seems to have protected her from a collapse and then broken free from the rubble, but is nowhere to be seen later as Guile and Abel watch the base explode, with an unconscious Chun-Li in Guile's arms. After these events, Guile returns to Charlie's grave, placing a beer bottle on it as a way of buying his old friend a drink. He tells the grave that although S.I.N.'s plans have been foiled, he knows that he hasn't seen the last of Shadaloo just yet..Street Fighter V  On October 2015, a datamining of Street Fighter V's PC beta test revealed fighter data and character meshes of Guile, Dhalsim, Juri, Urien, Alex, Ibuki and Balrog. Guile and the rest of the characters (except for Dhalsim who was confirmed earlier as a default fighter) were later confirmed as DLC at the PlayStation Experience on December 5th, 2015. Guile himself was unveiled on April 18th, 2016, showcasing his V-Skill, V-Trigger and Critical Art, along with some miscellaneous screenshots and his reveal trailer was shown the day after. He has been playable since April 28, 2016.Story  Prologue: 'Those Who Fight On' In the prologue story, he saves Abel (who is undercover) after he is found out by F.A.N.G, disrupting the fight before F.A.N.G has a chance to attack Abel any further. After a brawl, Guile deducts that Shadaloo is behind the missing hackers. F.A.N.G escapes and tells Guile that he will pay for interfering. Guile tells Abel to be patient and that continuing after him will lead him into another trap. In a flashback, Charlie gives him advice not to get so heated knowing of his hot temper. Guile understands and knows to keep the heart hot, but the mind cool as they spar. Back in the present day, Guile and Abel work together to investigate into the missing hackers, noting former S.I.N members are being abducted. They find the abandoned S.I.N laboratory and notice Juri, who is also at the lab. Abel questions Juri about what she's doing there, who taunts him and escapes, telling them there's nothing worth in the lab. Both Guile and Abel discover that Shadaloo's next plan is Operation C.H.A.I.N.S, much to their horrible shock until the lab crumbles. Abel almost gets crushed into the debris, but Guile helps him to escape, stating that he does not want to have his friends die. Back in China, Abel is happy that Guile saves him. He senses that Vega is nearby and fights him. Vega warns him about the \"stage of death\", before escaping. Guile tells Abel that fighting in the battlefield while staying in control means survival and that they're the ones who are going to win until the end.A Shadow Falls  In the game's main story, his superior, General Byron Taylor is investigating the Black Moon which had detonated over New York, causing loss of signal and blackouts. Guile informs Taylor that it might have connection to the missing hackers that have been kidnapped by Shadaloo. Taylor sends him on a mission to New York with Chun-Li joining to come along. In New York, he and Chun-Li find all Four Kings of Shadaloo. He tries to stop Chun-Li from fighting, but fails. Chun-Li is knocked down by M. Bison and is nearly finished off when Cammy saves her and helps her escape with Guile. Later, Cammy talks to Guile about the seven Black Moons and its connection to the missing hackers. She gives Chun-Li one of the keys to the Black Moons. Charlie, now resurrected, confronts Guile and fights him to get the key. Charlie manages to overpower Guile. Guile angrily throws a Sonic Boom, which Charlie absorbs. Charlie takes the key and leaves with Rashid and Azam. Guile is enlisted by Karin Kanzuki to stop Shadaloo and their plans. Zangief, who had received a key, gave it to a friend in India, so Guile and Zangief go to India to get it. When they get the key, they are ambushed by Balrog, Ed, Santamu, and other Shadaloo soldiers. They try to fight off Shadaloo, but Ed gets the key, which was hidden inside Zangief's chest hairs, and leave. Guile pilots an escape helicopter during the first assault on the Shadaloo base and reunites with Charlie. When they return to the Kanzuki Estate, Guile is relieved to see Charlie again. They subdue Abel, who is under the influence of Psycho Power. Charlie uses his absorption power to remove Abel's Psycho Power. As Charlie leaves to regroup with Rashid and Kolin, Guile gives his dogtag back to him. During the final assault against Shadaloo, both Chun-Li and Guile are confronted by Bison. Charlie appears and fights off M. Bison. Charlie sacrifices himself in an attempt to kill Bison as Guile helplessly watches. The sacrifice proves to be fruitless as Bison survives the kamikaze. Rashid eventually shuts down Operation C.H.A.I.N.S as a whole, allowing Ryu to finish off M. Bison. Guile escapes the explosion with Ryu and Chun-Li and reunite with the team. M. Bison was finally gone.Other Prologue Appearances Crossover appearances Marvel vs. Capcom series  Guile makes a brief appearance in Charlie's ending in X-Men vs. Street Fighter, vowing to avenge Charlie's apparent death, though he is named only as \"Charlie's friend\" and his face is obscured by shadows. He appears as a playable character in Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes.Capcom vs. SNK series  Guile appeared as a playable character in Capcom\u00a0vs. SNK: Millennium Fight 2000, Mark of the Millennium 2001/EO, SNK vs. Capcom: The Match of the Millennium\u00a0and SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos. Guile has a special introduction against Rugal Bernstein in the Capcom vs. SNK games where he cuts a statue of himself in half with a Sonic Boom before Rugal destroys the base with a Reppuuken. This is in reference to The King of Fighters '94 where Rugal had a statue the likeness of Guile among his various trophies, and to how one of his most infamous acts was trying to kill Heidern of the Ikari Warriors mercenary group when the latter was in the military. SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos sees that Guile is in possession of vital and confidential information presumably gathered by the US government and the social climate the game's time setting portrays, having extensive knowledge of Geese Howard's intricate Southtown criminal empire, knowing that \"Blue\" Mary Ryan is undercover with Terry Bogard, and Doctor Thomas Light's inventions, especially those related with the \"Mega Man Project\", eventually confronting and mistaking Zero as the titular Mega Man.Capcom Fighting Evolution  Guile also appeared playable in Capcom Fighting Evolution.Street Fighter X Tekken  Guile is a playable character in Street Fighter X Tekken, where he is paired with Abel. He is ordered to secure Pandora, and is called by Abel to get a ride to the South Pole in order to join him. Though Guile allows this, he orders Abel not to blow their cover - which he nearly does on several occasions. During the cutscene before their rival battle against Heihachi and Kuma, Abel makes a \"deal\" with Heihachi, stating that they will take Kuma if they win - a proposition neither Guile nor Kuma particularly approve of. Guile is less than fond of bears, and is in no hurry to compromise his mission; Kuma and Heihachi, on the other hand, assumed Abel intended to eat the former (a running joke throughout the game), when in reality Abel simply wanted to pet him. Once they defeat Ogre and get to Pandora, Abel is mesmerized by Pandora's beauty, while Guile attempts to pull him back, saying they don't know whats inside Pandora, when the box opens and creates several \"alien\" copies of Kuma, which makes Abel come even closer, at which point Guile appears to give up on bringing back Abel and heads back to the U.S. Guile's ending after the credits shows he becomes world famous, and he appears to enjoy it all. However, due to Abel's actions during their journey to Pandora, Guile swears to never work with partners again - coincidentally, Abel's ending has him planning to call on Guile once more.Power Rangers Legacy Wars  Guile is a playable character in this game. As Rita Repulsa's hold on the Morphin Grid stretches across multiverses, Guile is among the warriors who are sucked into the Grid, pitted against those from the Power Rangers multiverse.Super Smash Bros. Ultimate  Guile is a summonable Assist Trophy. When summoned to battle, he will crouch and block enemy projectiles. If an opponent is too close, he will kick the opponent with his Flash Kick. He can also fire his Sonic Boom.Live-action Movies and Series Resurrection  Gulie was mentioned by Ken in the Street Fighter: Resurrection episode \"Fight & Flight\".Street Fighter: World Warrior  Gulie will appear in Street Fighter: World Warrior, Joey Ansah has stated that he would like to have Scott Adkins as Guile.Animations Street Fighter (TV series)  Guile serves as the main protagonist of the Street Fighter animated series, and is depicted as the leader of an organization of Street Fighters consisting of himself, Chun-Li, Blanka, Ryu, Ken, T. Hawk, Cammy, Dee Jay, Fei Long and Dhalsim. M. Bison has survived his battle with Guile following the events of the film, and Guile's sole goal is to destroy Bison once and for all.Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie  Guile is assigned to work together with Chun-Li in order to take down Bison, whose organization Shadaloo (Shadowlaw in the English dub) has been kidnapping several martial artists and brainwashing them to do his evil bidding. Guile is at first far from happy to work with another person on the case, claiming loudly that \"Bison's ass is mine\", but a distinct friendship builds up between him and the Interpol agent. The film follows Guile's plot from the video game in Guile tracking down Bison to avenge Charlie's death, and his vendetta is amplified when Chun-Li is severely beaten by Vega on Bison's orders. Near the end of the film, Guile manages to track Ryu down but is followed by Bison and a brainwashed Ken. Guile engages Bison in combat but is outmatched by the crime lord's overwhelming speed and only manages to damage his cape with a Sonic Boom. Bison then finishes the fight by blasting Guile down a chasm. Guile survives this, although exhausted and bloodied, and when Bison finds Guile, he decides to spare him as an insult, and leaves. Guile is rescued along with Balrog by E. Honda. In his final scene, Guile, fully recovered, is moved to tears when informed that Chun-Li survived Vega's attack.Street Fighter II V  In this TV series, Guile is a Technical Sergeant (E-6) in the U.S. Air Force, who spends most of his time training physically and who has great pride in the Air Force. He faces Ryu in a bar fight after Ryu and Ken beat up some of his men (although it was Guile's men who started the fight in the first place when Ken stole one of their dates). Guile easily defeats Ryu, only to face Ken, who challenges him in an air force base to avenge Ryu. Despite a severe hangover, Guile is able to defeat Ken, which motivates the duo to start a training journey and improve their martial art skills by challenging opponents around the world. While in India, Ryu fights an imaginary Guile during a training session, but stops the fight and acknowledges his respect for the Sergeant for showing them how arrogant they were and inspiring them to travel the world. Later in the series, Guile is recruited by Ken's father along with his friend Charlie (who retains his Japanese name, Nash, in the dub) when Ryu, Ken and Chun-Li are taken captive by Shadaloo. He faces Zangief while infiltrating Bison's base, while Nash confronts Bison himself. Guile knocks Zangief out, but is unable to save Nash from Bison, who pits a brainwashed Chun-Li against the enraged Sergeant. Outside, Guile fights Chun-Li until Bison's demise snaps her out of her brainwashing, and he is last seen showing admiration for Ryu and Ken when they emerge unharmed from the battlefield.Comics and Manga Udon Comics  Guile is given a central role alongside Chun-Li, particularly in the first arc but he also is a frequent cast member in later arcs. Similar to the official story, Guile is chasing after Shadaloo to discover the whereabouts of his Air Force buddy, Charlie Nash. Guile is first introduced to Charlie after his aircraft is shot down and Charlie commands a black-ops mission to rescue him. Like the official story, Charlie teaches Guile to fight. For the first arc of the comics, Guile spends his time looking for Ryu, believing to there to be a connection between him and Shadaloo. He traces him to the US and then back to Japan. While in Japan, he and Chun-Li engage a Shadaloo-controlled Charlie (codenamed \"Agent Shadow\") and fight him off. At the end of the first story arc, Charlie regains his senses and rejoins Chun-Li and Guile before they're attacked by M. Bison. Charlie unleashes his latent Psycho Power abilities and sacrifices himself to take out Bison (Charlie giving his own life to stop Bison echoes Guile's ending in Street Fighter Alpha 3), leaving Guile distraught and swearing vengeance against Shadaloo. Afterwards, Guile continues to assist Chun-Li in looking for Bison (whom they believe survived his encounter with Charlie) but all the while juggling his struggling relationship with his wife, Julia, and their daughter, Amy. Eventually the family reconciles at the end of the comic's second arc. Guile isn't heavily active during the second series of comics (Street Fighter II) but he is given an invitation to Bison's tournament, which he accepts as his final bid for vengeance. The final series (Street Fighter II Turbo) documents Guile's entry into M. Bison's fighting tournament. While on Shadaloo island, he is contacted by Cammy, who needs his help but cannot openly assist him as she is attempting to fool Bison into thinking she is under his control. Through a carefully woven set of scripted matches, Guile and Chun-Li get themselves eliminated from the tournament and successfully free the Delta Red squadron. Together they manage to locate and destroy Bison's Psycho Drive before evacuating the island as it sinks. The aftermath of the tournament show that Guile is satisfied with the results, believing he has successfully avenged Charlie, and is now comfortably living with his family.Other appearances Street Fighter EX series Background  Since the storyline of Street Fighter EX is an alternate storyline, it takes place around the time that the event depicted in Street Fighter Alpha would have occurred. As such, M. Bison is very much at large, and in the process of building up his Shadaloo army. Guile awaits any news about his commander Charlie, who was last sent on a recon mission to discover the whereabouts of M. Bison's secret Shadaloo hideout. When no word is heard from Charlie in over a month, Guile begins to plead for the chance to lead a rescue mission, but his superiors refuse. Then word reaches Guile about an underground Street Fighting tournament being held, reportedly hosted by M. Bison himself. Guile sees this as the opportunity that he's been looking for, and arranges to enter the tournament as a way to investigate the whereabouts of his commander and best friend. During the tournament, Guile meets the interpol agent Chun-Li. At first, he is shocked to meet a woman who is such a competent fighter. Then he learns that she is a member of interpol, and that she is seeking revenge on M. Bison for the death of her father. He sees Chun-Li as a powerful potential ally, and conducts his investigation in cooperation with hers. Seeing the third EX tournament as a chance to take down M. Bison for good, he asks Chun-Li to be his partner, and she accepts.Endings Street Fighter EX  \"My burden is different from yours. For my friend and for Holger, I cannot rest until I have saved their souls. For I am an avenger!\"Street Fighter EX Plus \u03b1  \"Holger, vengeance is not everything!\" Guile, the soldier who once fought to avenge his friend. And he suffered because of it...as his mind was filled with maliciousness and fear.

It was the end of Shadaloo. \"Kill me already!\" said Vega. But just when Guile is about to comply and deliver the finishing blow, a voice begs him to stop.\n\"Vengeance is not what he would have wanted. Look, this is your child. Please give us a chance again!\"\nThe cold heart of a lone military man was warmed by the family he thought he abandoned.Street Fighter EX2 Plus  \"I must endure to protect my friends and family.\"\nThe training of the recruits was becoming extremely intense. \"Sir!\" answered the recruits. Guile murmured quietly in his mind...\n\"Revenge... It's nothing but an act of emptiness.\"Street Fighter EX3  Though Guile won the fight against Bison, he was seriously wounded, and was starting to lose consciousness. With the henchmen of the Shadaloo surrounding him, sounds of metal could be heard as one man snarled, \"...Time to die, hero...\" When Guile realized that this would be his last stand, the memories of his wife and daughter flooded in mind. As he rose to his feet, he thought, \"I won't let this be the end! I will come back to you!\"Gameplay and fighting style  Guile's overall style revolves around patiently anticipating the opponent's next move and attacking. He has a strong mix of solid offense and defense, combined with reliable agility and air grabs. However, if timed improperly, Guile himself could easily be baited into using his moves suddenly and be subject to sweeping and airborne attacks. Guile's moveset has remained fairly consistent throughout his appearances compared to the rest of the cast - his only special moves are the Sonic Boom and Flash Kick. Both moves require a charge motion, thus, he requires a bit of skill and frequent use of certain situations such as jump-ins to make use of trying to integrate them into combos. Due to his more difficult standard offensive use, Guile is more known for trying to space his opponent more than trying to gain an offensive edge, so staying one step ahead and proper execution is vital. In Street Fighter V, while Guile still retains two special moves, he now has three new methods to his battle plan; Faultless Move allows him to keep his charge while moving forward, using his V-Skill, Sonic Blade, Guile spins up energy to create a stationary projectile that can also power up his Sonic Booms, and finally Guile powers up and tosses out continuous Sonic Booms with each button throws when using his V-Trigger, Solid Puncher, he can throw a Sonic Boom at a different speed and it can be used in combos on three or four consecutive hits. Guile is known in particular for his various command normals and combo abilities, and is also one of the most notable characters in fighting games to have a double hitting sweep (though only one can hit unblocked). Overall, his gameplay style is a contrast to Charlie's gameplay style but is also rivaled with Charlie when using two of their special moves such as Sonic Boom and Flash Kick despite the former's Flash Kick ability changed into Sonic Scythe.Super/Ultra Combos  Guile's signature Super Combo has been the Double Flash, sometimes better known as the Somersault/Flash Kick Strike; he performs 2 or 3 consecutive Flash Kicks in a row. Starting in Street Fighter Alpha 3, he also has the Sonic Hurricane, a short-range 'cyclone' projectile that traps the opponents if it hits; some games give it a bit of a vacuum effect. In the Street Fighter EX series, Guile can use the Opening Gambit, which features consecutive punches with a finishing sideways Flash Kick. His Meteor Combo in the EX series is called Sonic Boom Typhoon; he creates a giant Sonic Boom tornado that inflicts a heavy amount of damage. In Capcom vs. SNK he gains another Super Combo called Total Wipeout, which allows him to perform consecutive punches that end with a final backhand punch that knocks the opponent away. His Ultra Combos in Super Street Fighter IV are the Sonic Hurricane and the Flash Explosion, a Double Flash followed by one more Flash Kick to strike the opponent as they fall out of the air. In Street Fighter V, Guile uses the Sonic Hurricane as his Critical Art and has another move called Sonic Tempest which deals slightly more damage than the Sonic Hurricane in which receives a damage and range boost when his V-Trigger is active. This ability is also a contrast to Charlie's Judgement Saber who also deals using Sonic Hurricane in a vertical manner by slamming behind his opponent's head after being engulfed in a dark mist.Trivia See also References Ibuki  Ibuki (\u3044\u3076\u304d, Ibuki) is a video game character from the Street Fighter series, first appearing in Street Fighter III: New Generation. She is a young ninja-in-training from an ancient clan that would rather live a normal life of a modern Japanese teenager.Biography Appearance  Ibuki has a curvy yet athletic build, and her black/brown hair, remarkably divided in long, angular bangs at the front and back, is held back tightly in a topknot that drops well below her waist. Unlike most other female characters in the same genre, Ibuki's outfit is a more traditional type of ninja dogi, consisting of a sleeveless black upper garment, baggy pants, arm guards, and a mask that conceals the lower half of her face. Her footwear consists only of cloth bandages that are wrapped around her shins, ankles, and instep. Her garments are more revealing than normal ninja ones, however. As seen in one of her win animations in Street Fighter III, Ibuki's normal clothes consist of a white sleeveless loose shirt, blue denim pants, and gray and black sneakers. She also carries a yellow backpack. Her school uniform consist of a light blue sleeveless shirt under a white short sleeve button shirt with a red laced ribbon at the center of her collar, light blue skirt, black panties underneath, white socks, and blue and white sneakers. In Street Fighter V, she wears her school uniform and sneakers in battle, similar to Sakura, but also her mask as well as dark brown arm and leg guards with brown straps, matching dark blue long fingerless gloves, knee-high socks beneath the guards and a brown knife holster on her right thigh where she keeps her kunais. Her first alternate costume is a white sleeveless short dress with a red sling bag at the right side and matching white lined heels. Her second alternate costume consist of a purple sleeveless side-tie dress with light pink flower designs at the left side, a red trim with a matching pink obi, a large ribbon on her back complete with white knee-high leg guards, black ninja arm guards and brown lower heeled sandals. Her hair is dark brown and tied in a high ponytail in a full fringe. In her ending in 3rd Strike, she was depicted wearing an outfit similar to her first alternate costume in Street Fighter V but it was shown as her second casual outfit seen in her arcade ending. She wears a salmon pink sleeveless top, gray denim skirt and her white lined heels. She also carries her yellow backpack from her first casual outfit. Ibuki tends to have ninja themed accessories in some of her casual outfits. Her 2nd alternate in Street Fighter IV has a chain of miniaturized toy kunais and a shurikien belt buckle, and has added ninja elements to two of her uniforms and her school swimsuit.Personality  Even though Ibuki is a well-trained ninja, she is still a normal teenage girl, and states on several occasions that she finds her ninja garments ugly and her daily training strange. She also has a typical interest in boys; in several of her win quotes in Super Street Fighter IV, she evaluates her opponents based on their looks, behavior, and clothing, as well as their fighting performance. She regards Guy in particular as quite a hunk, though she also complains about his non-traditional ninja garb. She has also shown slight interest in others like Blanka and Fei Long. Ibuki is also very conscious about her weight, as mentioned in her Street Fighter \u00d7 Tekken winquote against Bob and her Arcade mode ending in Street Fighter V. Ibuki seems to be well in touch with modern pop culture and self awareness. In Street Fighter \u00d7 Tekken her winquotes against some characters, especially those who come from Tekken, seem to reference memes or even her own faults. She references \"Ninjas vs. Pirates\" when defeating Jack-X, hints at Naruto when she defeats Lili, saying \"Forehead protector? I don't need one of those... Maybe you should stop watching anime...\", referencing hairstyles when defeating Paul Phoenix, and lastly references her own low stamina when defeating Marshall Law. Most recently keeping with the trend with her sporty outfit with Sgt. Ashida from th C.R.I. commenting: \"Track and field? Lately it seems the minimalist style is in, and of course Ibuki is hip to the latest trends\". Ibuki also seems to be familiar with live streaming, as her reaction when defeating G has her more surprised she wasn't told their fight was being streamed rather than the fact that it was streamed itself. In Street Fighter V, Ibuki seems to take her ninja training more seriously (although her mirror match quote suggests she still finds it irksome), but still makes mistakes (such as almost falling off a cliff while talking on her cellphone, for example) and has many moments of not using her head. She is also glad to return home when her story mode is completed. In the Street Fighter III series, Alex is the only \"boy\" Ibuki has shown anything resembling a hint of attraction to; however, though she calls him a \"macho stud\" in a win quote, she is mainly expressing her disappointment in his loss of \"power instinct\". In-universe, it seems she is not taken too seriously as a fighter. Many characters tend to mention how she lacks some attributes. Characters like Chun-Li and Ken saying she needs to focus more, Kolin talks about how not worth remembering her fights are with her, Balrog not taking her seriously pre and post fight, and Kazuya Mishima straight up telling her that she is the worst ninja he has ever faced. The only characters who do not verbally accost her are characters who are among the nicer end like Menat, or pre-established friends like Elena and Karin.Character Relationships Guy  Ibuki first met Guy when she was on her ninja class, they fought in a training fight, Ibuki was impressed with Guy's ninjutsu skills and since then the two became some sort of rivals. In her win quotes against Guy, Ibuki displays fondness to Guy but complains about his looks, telling that his outfit does not look like that of a ninja.Zeku  When Ibuki first meet Zeku, in his younger form, she found him to be handsome. He offers her a chance to to join his group. After fighting Zeku he shows his elderly form, much to Ibuki's disappointment, and she turns down his offer.Sakura  Ibuki seems to have begun a friendship with Sakura, based on their rival match in SSFIV and their similar background as high school fighters interested in boys (or at least a particular boy, in Sakura's case). Also, when Ibuki defeats Sakura in a round with a Super Combo Finish, she says \"We should totally hang out sometime!\", with her match victory quote saying \"I never meet anyone cool at my school\". In Street Fighter V, they are seen having a conversation via their cellphones. It is through Sakura that she became acquainted with Karin.Oro  Ibuki was tasked with fighting Oro as her final task as a ninja. While she was unable to defeat him, she is one of the few to wound him. He even thought she would ask him out on a date.Karin  When Sakura calls Ibuki to fill in for the event Karin is hosting, Ibuki accepts. Ibuki heads to the\u00a0Kanzuki Estate and after brawling with Birdie, meets Karin. Karin politely greets Ibuki and challenges her to a match. Afterwards, Ibuki watches a match between two teams composed of R.Mika and Zangief and Laura and Alex. During this match Karin's screen goes out. Ibuki helps Karin as she angrily leaves. She eventually hires Ibuki. The next day, Ibuki and Mika go with Karin to the Shadaloo base. After defeating Balrog, they give Karin a piece. Ibuki was last seen with Karin waiting for Ryu, Chun-Li, and Guile to come out of the Shadaloo base.R. Mika  Though they never fought, Mika and Ibuki usually argue when they see each other, as seen in the latter's character story. Mika consider Ibuki to be rude for not listening to her \"wonderful\" speech about \"muscle spirit\". On the other hand, Ibuki considers Mika to be bossy because what she says is demanding and boring. In\u00a0SFV, after they argue again for supposedly getting lost,\u00a0Ibuki saves\u00a0Mika from an attacking\u00a0soldier, and Mika saves\u00a0Ibuki from Balrog and escapes.\u00a0Whenever Ibuki sees Mika bragging about how awesome Zangief is she thinks that it is gross.Rolento  In Street Fighter X Tekken, Ibuki does not get along well with Rolento due to his constant orders, which she follows reluctantly, and the military titles he bestows on her during their story. Rolento also seems to be one of the few people she was not previously acquainted with who has a low opinion of her fighting skill, as even in Street Fighter IV both of their winquotes against each other still suggest the possibility of Ibuki joining his army due to her skills.Story Background  Ibuki is a young girl from Japan who lives in a village entirely composed of ninjas, hidden from society's watchful eyes, where she has trained in the deadly art of ninjutsu since childhood. After doing the same routine everyday and attending a school for ninjas, she wishes to live like a normal schoolgirl. Her best friend is her classmate, Sarai. Ibuki also has a pet tanuki named Don.Super Street Fighter IV  Ibuki sneaks away from her clan's summer training camp to compete in S.I.N's tournament, in order to meet cool and handsome guys. When the tournament is over, she realizes that she is going to be late for camp and attempts to sneak back in as if nothing had happened. However, she is caught by one of the camp's instructors.Street Fighter V  On October 2015, a datamining of Street Fighter V's PC beta test revealed fighter data and character meshes of Ibuki, Dhalsim, Juri, Urien, Alex, Guile and Balrog. Ibuki and the rest of the characters (except for Dhalsim, who was confirmed earlier as a default fighter) were confirmed on December 5th, 2015 at the PlayStation Experience. On May 29th, 2016, Ibuki's official trailer was released.Character story  Prologue - 'The World Is My Oyster!' In her character story, Ibuki has finally finished her ninja assignment and receives a call from Sakura, whom she met and befriended in Super Street Fighter IV. She informs Ibuki of a party invitation sent from her rival, Karin Kanzuki. Ibuki replies that she hasn't read it yet, because she almost fell through a roof while she was getting home to the ninja village, so Sakura tells her to travel to the Kanzuki Estate by plane. Before hanging up, Sakura tells Ibuki that she can't come due to a scheduling conflict. Ibuki reflects on what she should wear to the party and how she's never met Karin before. After arriving at the Kanzuki Estate, Ibuki is excited to get to the party. However, she is ambushed by Birdie and forced to fight him. After defeating Birdie, Ibuki tells him that she also has an invitation to the party. Karin intervenes and scolds Birdie for his rudeness to her guest. Karin and Ibuki introduce themselves, and both have heard of the other from Sakura's stories. Karin then engages Ibuki in a fight, telling her this will be her introduction. After the fight, Karin informs Ibuki that she is interested in working with Ibuki's ninja clan, and that she had invited her as per the clan's recommendation. Karin states that the contract has already been approved by the Glade of Ninjas, and while Ibuki initially refuses to sign it, she is enticed by Karin's promise that her parties always attract handsome men. After the party, Ibuki reflects on all the people she has encountered since leaving her village, among them R. Mika. She is seen conversing on the phone with her friend, Sarai, as she returns home to her village, satisfied with her experiences.Other story appearances: A Shadow Falls  Ibuki is seen at the Kanzuki Estate with Birdie, watching a tag team match between Zangief and R. Mika against Alex and Laura. The screen suddenly shuts off, a result of the electromagnetic pulse caused by Shadaloo's Black Moons. Karin decides to travel to New York to find out who is responsible for the activation of the Black Moons, and Ibuki goes with her. After returning to the Kanzuki Estate, Ibuki is seen having an argument with R. Mika, while Karin and Cammy discuss the plan to stop Shadaloo. The estate is suddenly attacked by Shadaloo agents, among them Decapre and Marz. After defeating them, Karin threatens Ibuki and Mika with the same punishment unless they stop fighting. During the first infiltration of the Shadaloo base, Ibuki and R. Mika continue to argue, until they are confronted by Balrog and Ed, who managed to get one of the chess pieces that control the Black Moons from Zangief. Ibuki is the first to fight Balrog, her ninjutsu skills are not sufficient to beat him. Mika then engages him, but she also fails. The two then team up and succeed in overpowering him. Ed tries to use his Psycho Power to stop them, and Ibuki uses a smoke bomb to distract both of them. She and Mika take the chess piece and escape, finally being reunited with Karin and her butler, Shibasaki. Karin takes the chess piece and goes on ahead, while Ibuki and R. Mika wait for the rescue helicopter to arrive. Karin returns with Chun-Li, and both are being chased by Abel, who has been brainwashed by Bison's Psycho Power. Zangief appears and knocks Abel out with a Spinning Piledriver, then proudly flexes his muscles. Ibuki is disgusted, yet Mika is amazed. In the final assault against Shadaloo, Ibuki is hesitant about jumping out of a helicopter, as she is afraid of heights. Nevertheless, Dhalsim pushes her out. During the mission, Ibuki and Mika fight off Shadaloo soldiers, and they watch Zangief's fight against Satsuki. Ibuki becomes worried and tells Zangief to watch out for Satsuki's sword, but to her surprise, the blade shatters when it hits Zangief's muscles. Ibuki is last seen with the other fighters, watching Shadaloo's destruction.Street Fighter III series 2nd Impact  Later in 2nd Impact, Ibuki was sent by her clan to procure documents from Gill's organization. These documents concern the \"G-File\" project, which was responsible for creating Necro (before he ran away from the organization) and Twelve. Gill voluntarily gave Ibuki the documents after she defeated him, though the project was already underway by that point. In her ending, Ibuki and Don are laying on the grass, the former thinks about the time she was given the G-Files by Gill. Ibuki suddenly sense someone's presence and throws her kunais at the person, who turns out to be just Sarai, who blocks it with her school bag. Sarai scolds Ibuki for ruining her school bag, Ibuki apologizes.3rd Strike  In 3rd Strike, Ibuki tracks down Oro to fight him for her ninja graduation exam. She fights well enough to pass, and moves on to go to a university. In her ending, Ibuki is excited to make it in Sarusuberi University after a lifetime of training. She explores the campuses, meeting new friends as well as the cool upperclassman in college who convinces her to join his club. However, much to her dismay, the club that she joins turns out to be a hard and dangerous ninja training club. The upperclassman holds her at kunai-point as he warns Ibuki about her carelessness and laughs at her \"love and excitement\" of studying Ninjutsu, much to Ibuki's disappointment.Crossover appearances Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix  Ibuki appeared as a playable character in Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix (also known as Pocket Fighter). Ibuki decides to leave her village for a while, and quietly departs for a trip to a big city, and along the way, she challenges Sakura for the knowledge of the closest ice cream shop. After learning the location of the closest ice cream shop from Sakura after their battle, Ibuki while musing happily about what she wanted to get next, she spots Guy, thinking that he is a spy from another clan, and declares a challenge from him. Guy then tells her to calm down for a second, and gives Ibuki a baked potato. While Ibuki is distracted by the baked potato, Guy tells her that he has errands to run for his master and sneaks away, as Ibuki had now forgotten what she was going to do.Street Fighter X Tekken  Ibuki appeared as a playable character in Street Fighter X Tekken where she is partnered with Rolento, who had sent a request to her village for someone skilled in fighting and infiltration in his search for the Pandora artifact. Due to Rolento's constant orders which she follows reluctantly, Ibuki does not particularly get along well with her new partner, despite the military titles he bestows on her as their story progresses. The Swap Costume of Tekken character Asuka Kazama is based on Ibuki's design.Comics Street Fighter Legends: Ibuki  UDON Entertainment released a four-volume mini-series based on Ibuki and her storyline in Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike, where she is rivals with Makoto. Each volume was also collected into a single book for UDON's Street Fighter Legends series. She appears in volume 3 of this series, preceded by Chun-Li and Sakura. She meets Viper at somepoint after her training with Oro, telling her that Ninjas follow their own way, later she comes across Ryu who told that she still has a long way to go.\u00a0she\u00a0appears on Gill's island with Elena and Makoto as they both fight against Gill to foil his plains of world domination with many other fighters.\u00a0Gameplay Fighting style  As a ninja, Ibuki is skilled in ninjutsu; specifically its curriculum of martial arts. Unlike Guy, her style emphasizes a more traditional depiction, like that of ninjutsu found in the regions of Iga and Koga, utilizing kicks, grabs, speed, agility and accuracy for an aggressive and deadly approach. Ibuki has many mobility options and pre-SFV had many anti projectile options like EX Neckbreaker. She tends to have many multi hitting attacks. While she generally does below average damage a player with good execution can do multiple 1 frame in a combo to match most of the cast. Her Raida tends to have unique properties, being immune to command throws in the IV series, being the only 2 frame non super special in Street Fighter X Tekken, and having anti back technical mechanics of command grabs despite it's hitbox being classified as a strike. As a tradeoff for her advantages she has been a rather frail character throughout her Street Fighter existance. She is usually around the 900 HP mark, 100 less than average.Moveset  Ibuki's fighting style is characterized by her speed and agility. Several of her special moves are useful in both closing distance and evading her foe and/or their attacks: her Hien, for example, is capable of letting her jump over most projectiles while following up with a vaulting kick, and her Kasumi Gake can allow her to pass through opponents entirely, giving her the potential to set up confusing cross-ups (or the potential to just confuse in general). While she may not be as strong as other characters, Ibuki's attacks hit fast, and like other characters from the Street Fighter III series, she possesses Target Combos which allow her to chain several normal moves in less than seconds. These combos are really not easy to perform though, especially her punch combos, where she has very low range in. Her speed and agility also often can be rather confusing for the one who actually plays her. Some of her special moves like the Tsuijigoe basically do no damage alone and put the player into situations where she becomes extremely vulnerable, and these moves have very similar input commands as some of her others, but are only good for totally different situations. Other specials also require good timing and aiming to actually hit something, instead of attacks which just go straight forward. This means to play effectively with her, the player really must be able to play very controlled and have very good reflexes, otherwise the player won't have much success with her. In Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix, Ibuki retains all of her Street Fighter III moves and some of her special attacks like the Kunai and her Kasumi Suzaku Super Combo when she diguises as Rolento. Her unique special attack is when she smacks her opponent in two kicks. She has the most disguise forms than the rest of the characters with a total of seven disguises (Eg. Kendo student, a Japanese marker where she could paint the opponent in black, a Bushido, Traditional Japanese singer, a Japanese magician to make a tornado spin on her opponents, a penguin suit and cosplaying as Rolento). One of her Mighty Combos has her disguise as a Bushido to slash her opponent in one strike to deal heavy damage. If her opponents are obliterated with this move an ocean wave background will be seen. She also wears her casual outfit from one of her Street Fighter III win animations but it was a short sleeved shirt than a sleeveless shirt from her ending while meeting with Guy. In Street Fighter V, she uses a number of new tools, including (among many others) a sort of kite-based float which she uses for flight, bombs, and what appears to be a counter. She can also teleport to dodge her opponent's attack or to countering them with her moves. Unlike in her previous appearances, she can throw a multiple of five kunais to her opponent rather than a single kunai as her projectile even in mid-air. Therefore, she has a limiter to her kunais when using them and she cannot use this ability again once it is emptied, she restores it for another round. Her\u00a0Kazekiri now has additional damage during her EX special in which she throws an explosive kunai to blow her opponents after execution. Her V-Skill is the Tenrai which Ibuki builds up a blue energy and blasts her opponent with her left palm. Her V-Trigger is the Isshaku Horokudama which Ibuki throws a bomb with Don's face or a pirate skull similar to one of Doctrine Dark's special attacks which it explodes in seconds. She uses this as her tactic move where she gives her a chance to make a combo once her bomb is briefly delayed in timing to explode or quickly exploded on her opponent. Her Critical Art is the Kachofugetsu as she trips her opponent with a low sweep while launching them in mid air with a straight kick similar to her Hashinsho Ultra Combo as she teleports while doing ninja hand signs to culminate a burst of blue energy on her left palm similar to her Yoroitoshi Super Art to wipe out her opponent's skull in a deadly explosion.Pop Culture  Ibuki/Pop CultureQuotes  See: Ibuki/QuotesTrivia Gallery  Ibuki/GallerySprites  Ibuki/SpritesSee also References Cody  Cody Travers (\u30b3\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30fc\u30fb\u30c8\u30e9\u30d0\u30fc\u30b9, K\u014dd\u012b Torab\u0101su) is a video game character who debuted in the beat-em-up series Final Fight before appearing as a playable fighter in the Street Fighter series starting with Street Fighter Alpha 3. He was initally a reckless vigilante who fought to survive the harsh slums of Metro City since he was a kid, having gone through a lot, even being imprisoned for his 'good deeds' and trumped-up charges from his enemies. He has since then become the city's new mayor.Biography Appearance  Before being arrested, Cody was clean-shaven, and his outfit consisted of blue jeans, white sneakers, a white t-shirt and blue bandages wrapped around his wrists as well as the lower half of his hands. Cody's hair is dark blond in the original game, its sequel and in Mighty Final Fight, and light blond in all of his Street Fighter appearances, including the comics and the American television series. However, the official artwork for Final Fight suggests that Cody was always intended to be light blond. If that is the case, then his Final Fight sprites may have been subjected to a coloring error on the developers' part. As a jailbird, he had facial stubble and handcuffs which were linked by a long chain. The hand bandages are white and cover the hands completely, leaving only the fingers exposed. The t-shirt and the jeans were replaced by an old-fashioned prison jumpsuit with white and blue stripes. He keep the white sneakers, though. Unlike most convicts, Cody does not mind being in his prison apparel but, as seen in his Street Fighter Alpha 3\u00a0taunt, he can easily remove the handcuffs. In Street Fighter V: Arcade Edition, his jailbird outfit returns as his nostalgia costume, and his original outfit returns as his \"Final Fight\" costume. In Final Fight: Streetwise, he wears his original outfit with an orange prison shirt over the t-shirt. Some of the official artwork for\u00a0Final Fight\u00a0implied that Cody has always worn Adidas Superstars, but it was his Street Fighter Alpha 3 sprite that fully confirmed this idea. Guy wears Nikes, which may be a reference to the competition between the two sports brands in real life. In his Shadaloo C.R.I. profile artwork, Cody wears an orange prison outfit with the sleeves tied on his waist as well as a white tank top. He wears his white sneakers from his outfit in Final Fight. In Street Fighter V, Cody, as a mayor, has a drastically altered appearance; his hair is now shorter and slicked back and he wears a business attire, including a purple formal vest with brown upper outlines, a light blue and white pinstripped long sleeve button-up shirt with the sleeves folded into cuffs and a red neck tie with brown and white linings on the collar, as well as black formal pinstripe pants with a gray belt around his waist which he had holstered his combat knife and black shoes. He notably no longer wears handcuffs. His appearance is similar to Eagle, though without the mustache and the dinner-suit.Alternate Costumes  Cody's first downloadable costume in Super Street Fighter IV is a more stylised take on his attire from Final Fight, with the t-shirt being replaced with a white tank top with black trims. He also has tattoos, jewelery, and hand accessories, none of which were featured in his Final Fight design. His second downloadable costume is a modern prison uniform, which is orange and replaces the sneakers with black sandals. It resembles, to some degree, his outfit from Final Fight: Streetwise. In Street Fighter X Tekken,\u00a0Cody also has two DLC costumes: a police uniform similar to that of\u00a0Edi. E's worn over his default, and a Swap Costume based on Paul Phoenix. In Street Fighter V: Arcade Editon, Cody's story costume is based off Haggar's outfit in the Final Fight series. He wore green baggy pants with a brown belt rapped around the torso. Cody isn't able to fit the pants, so his costume reveals his blue boxers that have a cow graphic on them that only reveals the head of the cow (a reference to Holstein - a cow sprite that could be obtained as a bonus item in several classic Capcom arcade games). Cody's battle costume is a white tuxedo, with a black bow tie and a rose, black formal pants and dark brown loafers. Like other returning characters, Cody's nostalgia costume returns from Super Street Fighter IV which can also be toggled to reveal a tank top underneath it with the upper-half of his prison uniform tied by the sleeves at his waist in a similar fashion his to Shadaloo C.R.I profile picture. Cody's Final Fight attire also makes an appearance in Street Fighter V: Arcade Editon which can also be toggled to show some wear-and-tear.Concept  Cody Travers was likely inspired by the similarly-named Tom Cody, the main protagonist of the 1984 film Streets of Fire. Both are formidable street brawlers that are good with knives, and wage war on the local gang in an attempt to rescue their love interests along the way; in the end, they both walk out on the girl.Personality  In\u00a0Final Fight, Cody is depicted as being a combative, reckless but ultimately positive and good-natured man, having a powerful sense of justice and love for his\u00a0girlfriend, Jessica. However, in his Street Fighter appearances,\u00a0after breaking up with Jessica, losing touch with his friends and spending several years in prison, Cody has become extremely aloof, apathetic and doubtful. He remains pugnacious as ever, occasionally breaking out of prison just to fight and relieve his boredom, and often maintains his generally dismissive air - a major exception being when he finds an opponent that can entertain him. He interprets his imprisonment as punishment for his ultimately good deeds, and even admits that the idea of achieving any constructive goal (such as overcoming rivals or taking care of family) is lost on him. Cody harbors some internal resentment towards the outside world, musing that he fought solely for the sake of Metro City but ended up imprisoned for it. According to his ending in the Street Fighter IV games, he feels at home in prison. Despite this, and as certain dialogue indicates, while Cody appears to have given up on fighting crime, he still retains his old sense of justice and an enduring (albeit subdued and exhausted) desire to oppose evil. In particular, his win quote against M. Bison shows that his true feelings come through when he confronts great evil (\"I don't consider myself a good guy anymore, but I had to take\u00a0you\u00a0down!\"), although he immediately tries to hide it. Cody also gives his respect to people who need to do business. This is shown in his win quote against T. Hawk, in which he tells him to not let him stand in the way of what he has to do and then wishes him good luck (\"Don't let me stand in your way if you got stuff to do. Good luck!\"). During the events of Street Fighter V, his behavior has somewhat changed as the Mayor of Metro City, showing his confidence in fighting his opponents and having more spunk in his step. While his laid-back demeanor is still present and he still misses his simple street fighting days, he has a more positive outlook and secretly enjoys his new position. Similar to Makoto in her rival quote against Fei Long in Super Street Fighter IV, Cody happily laughs after defeating G\u00a0to gain more popularity in their local\u00a0government of Metro City for his victory indicating that he fought him on his open challenge between the mayor and the president.Relationships Allies Marlowe  Marlowe is the one who usually pulls Cody in line when his nostalgia for fighting gets the better of him, and she won't hesitate to scold him if needed. Despite all that, they have a healthy professional relationship, and she is the one who keeps Cody's schedules and tasks in order.Neutral Mike Haggar  When Haggar met Cody, he didn't exactly approve of him. Seeing him more as a troublemaker than anything. Most likely, this initial doubt only grew when Cody started dating Jessica. However, during the events of the first Final Fight, Haggar warmed up to the idea of Cody being a good guy and came to respect him as a man, ultimately approving Cody dating his daughter, mostly because he would also risk his life to rescue her. Cody was often annoyed by his lecturing though. However, after his return to Metro City, Cody started getting into trouble more and more. This made his relationship with Haggar turn sour again. Despite this, Haggar never lost hope of him one day becoming the great man he once found when they fought the Mad Gear Gang together. With this in mind, Haggar once again tried to help Cody out of his bad habits and miserable life. This eventually would end with Cody being elected to be his successor as Mayor of Metro City. While Haggar knew he wouldn't like the job at first, he completely believed Cody was the right man for the job, as he knew his sense of justice was much greater than his internal demons. As for Cody himself, he still rolls his eyes on his naggings, especially from his proxy Marlowe, but ultimately and instinctively finds the right path himself.Guy  Cody and Guy were originally very good friends and rivals who would battle often. Guy is also the only old friend Cody has associated with since he went to jail. In the Arcade Mode of Street Fighter Alpha 3, after defeating Guy, Cody concludes that \"some things never change\", most likely referencing one (or more) of his and Guy's past duels; based on their rival dialogue in both Street Fighter Alpha 3 and Super Street Fighter IV, Cody tends to have the upper hand. Despite their frequent battles, the two have no problem teaming up to achieve a common goal, and Cody even implies at least once that he enjoys doing so. It is implied that he hasn't seen Guy for a while since being released and being elected to office.Zeku  Cody may not be familiar with Zeku, but seems to be aware that he was Guy's master. By the time Cody is elected as the new Metro City mayor in Street Fighter V: Arcade Edition, Cody encounters him, who then offers his service of a new unnamed ninja clan he built, but Cody declines after challenging the old master, knowing he can't have shady work in his position.Jessica Haggar  Jessica and Cody were dating before and by the time of Final Fight, and they were clearly infatuated with each other then. However, Cody's imprisonment and Jessica's departure to study in Europe caused them to break up on a bitter note. It is often assumed their relationship is beyond repair ever since Cody's former incarceration. However, as seen in his Street Fighter V arcade ending, there does not seem to be any indication that Cody holds any grudge against her for their breakup, and actually still values her as a friend, especially in consideration of how he keeps a picture of them four (Jessica, Mike, Guy and himself) from way back in his desk (with some graffiti of his own scribbled).Enemies Edi. E  Edi is a corrupt cop who formerly tries to frame him for additional crimes and the man who usually takes him back to prison when he escapes. Being an enemy from way back, Cody likely has no problem putting him in his place by kicking him out. It's currently unknown where Edi is by the time his enemy is now his superior.Rolento F. Schugerg  Rolento's \"Street Fighter Alpha 3\" profile states that he remembers Cody who was once his enemy and plans to recruit him in his militia after hearing and learning about Cody's escape from jail. However, Rolento became genuinely outraged to see Cody's fall from grace and that the disappointed Rolento had soon cancelled his mission with Cody, moving on to bigger missions alongside his best friend and comrade Sodom. Like Guy, it's likely Rolento's unaware, but presumably relieved if he did, of Cody's current position as of SFV.Poison  A former member of Mad Gear, Poison is an old enemy of Cody's, alongside with Roxy, who has a crush on him, though Cody has stated numerous times that he's not into her.Story Background  Cody has practiced boxing and martial arts since he was 9, he has a girlfriend who has been his \"sweetheart since childhood\", Jessica. Cody also took care of his younger brother Kyle, being something of a father figure to him.Final Fight  In the original Final Fight, Cody teams up with his best friend/rival Guy and the Mayor of Metro City, Mike Haggar, to save Jessica (Haggar's daughter) from Belger, the leader of the Mad Gear gang. Cody takes on many of Mad Gear's worst thugs, including Damnd,\u00a0the first Mad Gear Gang member to kidnap Jessica, and Edi. E, a corrupt police officer who uses a gun and police baton against Cody, making the fight very difficult to win. His penchant for fighting often leaves the others free to pursue the other bosses of Metro City. In the end, Cody confronted Belger on the top floor of his penthouse, and after a tough battle, Cody was able to use an uppercut to knock Belger through a window, sending Belger plummeting from the top floor to his death on the street below. Cody is then celebrated as the hero of Metro City and Jessica herself wants to celebrate with Cody, but Cody tells Jessica that he can't sit still while evil continues to stalk the streets. After sharing a passionate kiss with Jessica, Cody leaves the city for parts unknown.Final Fight Revenge  Cody would soon reappear in Final Fight Revenge, which is chronologically set between the events of Final Fight and Street Fighter Alpha 3. He returned to Metro City from a year of traveling, where he learned that the Mad Gear gang is beginning to reform, and that his girlfriend Jessica has gone missing after a series of riots that occurred in the city following the destruction of Mad Gear. Hoping to prove himself that he is Jessica's hero, Cody tried once more to come to her rescue, battling many thugs along the way. Sadly, Cody wouldn't get the chance to continue his search for Jessica, as he was arrested by Edi. E for crimes that were committed by Mad Gear member Poison and the many street fights that Cody had participated in from his time. Jessica's whereabouts in the game are never resolved in any of the playable characters' endings. However, the design sketches for Cody from Street Fighter Zero 3, as well as the Street Fighter Zero 3 Secret File Book would establish that Haggar was able to rescue Jessica, and that she and Cody had ended their relationship on a bitter note, due to Cody being jailed for his reckless street fighting and that Jessica had decided to take a trip to study abroad in Europe.Street Fighter Alpha 3  Cody broke out of prison after a riot ensued. During his travels, he met up with Edi. E (who is trying to recapture him), Rolento, and even Guy once more. Rolento wanted him to join his militant movement, which Cody refused after a heated argument (though it's unknown if they had actually fought). Guy, meanwhile, wanted to reform Cody and get him back on the good path, but Cody said that he was no hero and basically lived for fighting. The two then had their own battle but after the two calmed down, Guy accepted the fact that his friend had to live his own life. The two separated afterward when Guy asked if Cody would stay in Metro City, but Cody said he still had traveling to do. Guy bade him farewell, realizing that deep down inside, Cody is still a good person.Street Fighter IV series  Apparently bored of prison life, Cody \"casually\" breaks out of prison. Telling the irritated guard that he'll be back soon enough, he ventures outside. While out, Cody sees a familiar face: his old friend and rival Guy, and the two spar. Cody's main motivation seems to be finding a way to alleviate his boredom by participating in S.I.N's tournament. After defeating Seth, Guy confronts Cody again, assuming there's still a bit of good left in him, asking if he \"vanquished a great evil\" for the sake of what's right. While he doesn't directly deny it, Cody claims that he only did it because Seth was in his way, making Guy assume he has no intention of returning. When given the question, Cody states he'll be returning to his prison cell, where he belongs.Street Fighter V  Cody makes his re-appearance in the third season of DLC fighters in Street Fighter V: Arcade Edition. Mike Haggar exonerates Cody of his crimes, which leads to him being the new mayor of Metro City. Now no longer a prisoner, he finds the job tedious and boring, but he secretly finds an opportunity in his new position as mayor to finally clean Metro City of its criminal activities in person (both physically and while at his desk), just like how his immediate predecessor and himself did way back.Character story  Prologue - 'Mayor's Schedule' In a cab, Cody is sitting alongside his assistant Marlowe, who informs him on a delayed appointment. She becomes annoyed that he doesn't seem to listen to her and informs him to fix his behavior as the mayor, explaining how about the previous mayor, Mike Haggar, asked her to support Cody. Cody quickly stops the cab and sees a monster truck illegally parked, he discovers the owner is his former enemy Abigail. After getting into a fight with him, Cody informs Abigail that he illegally parked his truck and the latter immediately recognizes Cody much to his surprise. Cody tells Abigail that he wants to improve the qualities of Metro City and to make everyone smile by taking down \"garbage\" like Abigail. Cody reflects about how he has gone from a vigilante, to a jailbird and now as the mayor of Metro City. He suddenly sensed someone's presence, revealed to be Zeku. Zeku informs him that he could help him manage the local government, Cody challenges him into a fight, wanting to see his skills. After defeating him, Cody turns down the offer, knowing he can't have shady work in his position. Marlowe turns up and scolds Cody for his actions in street fighting, especially since he had damaged one of the street lights during his fight with Zeku.Other appearances Final Fight: Streetwise  In the sequel to the original Final Fight, Cody has long retired from street fighting due to his knees suffering from arthritis, and instead coaches his younger brother Kyle in pit fights, but gets frustrated due to Kyle's lack of focus, which in turn stokes Cody's wish to fight once more. Due to this, Cody started to use a new drug called \"GLOW\", fueling Cody's strength and relieving the pain in his knees, but getting him addicted and out of control in the process. Without telling Kyle, Cody started fighting in Vito Bracca's fight club. However, Vito finds out about his drug use, and Cody is taken by the mob enforcer known as Devin Aranoc, leaving Kyle to search all over Metro City to look for his brother with the help of Guy, Haggar and others. He finds Cody, heavily addicted under Guy's custody, but Cody breaks free once again. Near the end, Cody fights Kyle as the Horseman of Death under the psychotic Father Bella, as revenge for Cody killing Bella's brother - Belger. When the fight is over, Bella holds Kyle at gunpoint, causing Cody to regain his senses and tackle Bella off the church, dropping along with him. After Bella dies and both Kyle and Cody are hospitalized, Cody has beaten his addiction and states (after jokingly asking Kyle for the date of their next match) that due to the massive dosage he received, his knees are feeling \"better than ever\".Cameo appearances  Cody and Jessica make a small stage appearance in Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter and Street Fighter Alpha 2. In the latter, if one or both characters battling on the Metro City stage are female, Cody passes them a naughty glance which results in him being slapped by an envious Jessica. He also has a cameo appearance in Capcom Fighting Jam.Crossover appearances Street Fighter X Tekken  Cody appears in Street Fighter X Tekken along with Guy as a DLC character. Approached by Guy in Metro City, Guy says he wants to stop Shadaloo and the Mishima Zaibatsu from getting their hands on the mysterious box of unknown power in Antarctica, Pandora, and that he needs Cody's help to do it. Cody sighs in response, but says he will do it, saying that the city was boring him anyway. On the way to Antarctica, they are attacked by a psychopathic zombie-cyborg named Bryan Fury and his giant robot, Jack-X, which classifies both of them as AAA rank fighters. Bryan attacks them to weed out the competition for Pandora, despite Cody's warnings. Guy dodges Bryan's attacks, and Cody matches the enormous Jack-X robot in strength. They defeat Bryan and move on. After their final victory against Ogre, they find Pandora in the middle of Antarctic. The wish-giving Pandora's Box senses the just wisdom and selflessness within their souls, and Pandora erases itself from existence before Cody and Guy can destroy it. Guy notes that it was all for the best, since its powers could bring untold chaos to the world, and Cody comments that it's all the same to him. As Cody leaves, Guy mentions how good it was to fight as a team again. Cody concedes and admits that it definitely was not boring. In a rare break from his usual stoicism, Guy smiles and says that's good to hear, and the two go home. In his ending, Cody felt satisfied from all the fighting he did on his journey, and on the way home, he encountered a gang fight. Initially wanting to avoid it, Cody agreed to intervene once the people asked him to. After the fight, Cody comments that he feels more like his old self, remembering how it is to fight for another's sake.Animations Street Fighter cartoon  Cody makes an appearance in the Street Fighter\u00a01995 cartoon where he is in a healthy relationship with Jessica and wears his Final Fight attire. He had some cameos in the episode \"The Medium is the Message\". In the beginning of the episode he was in the mob of people chasing a boy who was accused of stealing a wallet. He was later see alongside Jessica and other Final Fight characters in the crowd watching a Street Fighter tournament. Coincidentally Guy and Sodom were among the fighters in the tournament but both of them would lose to Chun-Li, Guile and Blanka. Cody plays a bigger role in the episode titled \"Final Fight\", which adapts the plot of its namesake. In this episode, Cody and Guy befriend Ryu and Ken, who aid them in fighting the Mad Gear Gang to save Jessica. Cody doesn't trust Ken due to the fact he once flirted with Jessica in front of him and Ken repeatedly teases him for it. Cody would refuse to let Ken and Ryu save Jessica on their own and decides to take matters into his own hands. Guy tries to stop him from blowing Ryu and Ken's cover but it was no use. The two would end up fighting against Rolento which ends with Guy throwing his grenades back at him and defeating him. Cody and Guy break into the Mad Gear gang's hangout which would blow Ryu and Ken's cover. Cody would kick Belger towards the window similar to what he did in the game. Belger fires a missile at Jessica and Haggar but was saved by Guy. Belger fell out of the window but while his chair hit a police van he was left dangling on a pole. Cody thanks Ken for helping him save Jessica which Ken responds \"No problem as long as somebody get's the girl.\"Comics UDON comics  In the Street Fighter II Turbo comic book published by UDON, Cody is presented as one of the toughest fighters around. Haggar has become tired of calling in favors to keep him out of jail while Cody is simply bored of his constant lectures; this causes him to give up, deciding he can't keep Cody out of jail forever. At some point he even lost track of how many times Cody escaped and re-entered jail. Prior to the World Warrior qualifier, he encounters former members of the Mad Gear Gang:\u00a0Hugo, Rolento and Poison. Cody comments that Hugo should have brought his entire freakish family if the Mad Gears planned to stand a chance against him. Apparently intimidated, the trio does not respond. During the qualifier itself, Cody defeats Poison, though she later leaves him cuffed to an elevator. After he manages to break free, Cody faces Ryu in order to claim the last remaining gold ticket for the competition. Ryu, wanting a fair fight, removes Cody's shackles, though Cody warns him that he is accustomed to fighting multiple foes and that, due to this fact, Ryu is already at a major disadvantage. As confirmation, Cody easily knocks Ryu unconscious. Before he manages to leave with the ticket, the\u00a0Satsui no Hado takes control of Ryu, who then defeats Cody. Fortunately, Ryu comes to his senses in time to stop himself from going any further. Cody makes a cameo as one of the inmates that Dan is giving \"therapy\" to, and he is among the fighters invited to Gill's Street Fighter tournament, often seen next to Guy.Gameplay Fighting style  Cody's fighting style, officially referred as \"Underworld brawling\", is street fighting in its \"purest\" form, and he proves to be a powerful opponent, even while restrained; his reason for keeping his handcuffs on is to make his fights more challenging and also because of his experience in the original Final Fight which made him capable of taking on multiple opponents at once, though he can take them off at any time. As such,\u00a0Cody was formerly one of three characters (the others being\u00a0Oro and Akuma) who voluntarily handicaps and restrain themselves due to their power or for a challenge. Cody is also one of the few playable characters in the Street Fighter series to utilize a weapon during fights. Unlike informal punkers and thugs like Abigail or Birdie who both place emphasis on brute strength, heavy hits and overall high damage, Cody's street fighting style is a mix of boxing combined with his black belt level teachings in martial arts such as karate. He is one of a very select group of characters who are \"pure\" street fighters whose fighting styles are a result of a mass accumulation of experience on the streets and adapting moves from watching and getting into fights rather then training from actual styles. As representative of the \"purest\" form of street fighting, this includes carrying on his person concealed weapons, adapting formal martial arts to formidable practical application, and knowledge of how to deal with unfair and extreme odds, including one man gang busting and handling unavoidable potentially consequence dire situations, including mortal risks. Though referred to as \"Underworld brawling\", the methods he picked up while in prison may refer directly to what is known in the US as \"Jailhouse Rock\", being a series of on penitentiary fighting styles developed within penal institutions by inmates. Within the time of his incarceration, his tactics got dirtier; focusing a little more on power, but still retaining some level of technique. As any other prisoner, Cody had to learn how to survive, to assert his dominance in a secured space with murderers and other hardened criminals in order to hold his own. This may explain his newer set of moves, including hurling any heavy object he could get his hands on to obstruct pursuers, using his kicks to trip over or aim heavy blows on the body, and how his knife skills were used akin more like a shank. In turn, he got stronger; strong enough to punch a man-sized hole in a brick wall to join the World Warrior Tournament twice, all the while wearing handcuffs. As of Street Fighter V, he no longer wears cuffs and may have learnt to limit his strength like Akuma, as his style appears to be more innovative and refined with his crude nature still in play. Not only does he use the iconic pipe, Dirty Coach, from Final Fight in new ways such as batting a projectile with it, he is no longer able to pick up his knife, but his knife skills have improved to the point of being able to wield it as an actual combat knife similar to other weapon users, notably Vega with his claw. He trades his technique of throwing rocks impromptu for wind gales he can project to the enemy.Moveset  In the Street Fighter games, Cody is an offense-oriented character with a diverse moveset, powerful normal attacks, and good combo capabilities. His movement speed is relatively slow, and lacks options when it comes to handling rushdowns, as many of his special moves are slow to come out. Cody's move set is mainly based on his Final Fight appearances, similar to other characters from the game, with some 'street fighting' moves added in. Cody possess a sliding kick that can strike at various heights, an uppercut that creates a tornado, which is useful against projectiles,\u00a0and can\u00a0throw sand\u00a0at the foe as a\u00a0reversal.\u00a0Cody can also\u00a0pick up rocks\u00a0and throw them at foes, with the ability to delay the throw in order to confuse the opponent. In the Street Fighter Alpha series,\u00a0his Super Combos\u00a0are\u00a0Dead End Irony and\u00a0Final Destruction, both of which work well at close range. Final Destruction also has unique properties based on the ISM being used, explained below. In V-ISM, Cody has a move called Yoke that can be used to dodge. In Super Street Fighter IV, he gains an additional\u00a0sucker punch\u00a0that can\u00a0break through Super Armor\u00a0(along with the Ruffian Kick). Dead End Irony returns as his Super Combo, and works differently, starting with a Ruffian Kick that depends on the kick button used. Final Destruction returns as his first Ultra Combo, and also works differently, centering instead around a single punch. His second Ultra Combo,\u00a0Last Dread Dust, allows him to strike from a further distance and nullify projectiles by kicking up sand. He follows this with a series of wrench attacks and finishes with a pipe. In\u00a0Street Fighter X Tekken, Final Destruction reappears as his Super Art, where it again works differently; it starts similarly to the Dead End Irony from Super Street Fighter IV, and the Ruffian Kick can be Supercharged into it. In Street Fighter V: Arcade Edition, Cody retains most of his moves from previous entries and gains more street fighting moves in a flashy style to his arsenal. Cody no longer threw rocks on his opponent or unleashing a refined version of his Criminal Upper. He gains a projectile called the Tornado Sweep, where he shoots a swirling gust of wind to his opponent. Much like Ruffian Kick, heavier versions lack range, but have better vertical hitboxes and power. It's also worth noting that EX Ruffian Kick hits twice, the second hit launching Cody's opponent into the air. His V-Skill is the Double Kick where he could land two kicks in mid-air on both sides resembling one of his old special attacks in Final Fight. His first V-Trigger is the Side Arm where Cody relies on hitting his opponent with his combat knife multiple times with Rapid Fire while dealing a combo. His second V-Trigger is the Dirty Coach where Cody relies on hitting the opponent with his pipe. He can execute both Bean Ball and a Gentle Swing once his second V-Trigger activates. He can also throw rocks when unleashing his Gentle Swing to hit his opponent. His Critical Art is the Criminal Punisher, a far more powerful version of his Criminal Upper where he unleashes a powerful giant tornado on his opponent to deal heavy damage.Final Fight-Inspired Moves  Final Fight's use of weapons - a common feature in \"beat 'em up\" games - is referenced in Cody's fighting style. His ever-present knife\u00a0even\u00a0appears in any fight in the middle of the stage where at least one player is using Cody; this is also a common trait of Cody's, which nods to his home series' usage of various objects as weapons, and the knife is his best weapon in the Final Fight games, and only Cody can pick it up and use it as a melee weapon. The knife can be used for fast, damaging attacks, and can also be throw at the foe (which replaces the Bad Stone). Additionally, in Super Street Fighter IV Cody uses a wrench during his Focus Attack, and uses the wrench along with a pipe during Last Dread Dust, as shown above. Cody's A-ISM Final Destruction is\u00a0an homage to a glitch that is well-known in practically almost every beat 'em up game, known as the \"infinite jab combo\", in Final Fight and any specific beat 'em up game in question; a player could deliver two hits from their neutral combo string, then instantly turn around \u2014 instantly canceling the combo \u2014 and then turn back and chain the same two hits; repeated, this could act as an infinite combo attack that can repeatedly frame lock the target(s). Cody mimics the attack, and finishes with another combo of punches and a Criminal Upper. His X-ISM Final Destruction changes the Super Combo Gauge\u00a0to a timer; for a short time, this replaces his moves with the original Final Fight moveset, where tapping any button repeatedly performs his normal combo from Final Fight, and all his air attacks are replaced with the Crack Kick. The Omega Mode in Ultra Street Fighter IV marks the return of several Final Fight mechanics: the \"original\" Final Destruction appears in the form of a command move called Final Combination, and Cody also regains his turn-around punch, named Fake Blow. Cody also regains his invincible spinning kick in the form of Mega Crash, which uses a bar of the Super Combo Gauge (in lieu of health, as in the original game).Quotes  See: Cody/QuotesTrivia Stage Theme  Cody's theme in Super Street Fighter IV and Street Fighter V: Arcade Edition are remixes of the opening music from the original arcade release of Final Fight.Gallery  Cody/GallerySprites  Cody/SpritesSee also References Seth  Seth (\u30bb\u30b9, Sesu) is a video game character from the Street Fighter series, first appearing as the main antagonist of Street Fighter IV. He is the CEO of\u00a0Shadaloo's weapon division, S.I.N., and one of many genetically engineered replacement bodies for M. Bison.Biography Appearance  Bearing silver skin and an extremely muscular physique, Seth is a synthetic human that lacks clothing or hair; whether he is an android or cyborg, or both, is unclear. In his abdomen, enclosed inside a pattern consisting of the Eight Trigrams of Taoist cosmology known as the Taijitu, is an exposed area, which contains a rotating sphere known as the Tanden Engine, which appears to be his source of his power. His eye and skin color changes to yellow and black respectively, when the Tanden Engine is activated. At the height of 6'6\" (198 cm) and weight of 187lbs (85 kg), Seth is abnormally light for someone of his size and musculature, implying whatever material he was constructed from is considerably lighter than human tissue. Seth's appearance is similar to countless other characters with featureless humanoid designs, such as Doctor Manhattan (Watchmen), Silver Surfer (Fantastic Four), Geegus (World Heroes), Tyrant T-103 (Resident Evil 2) and Dural (Virtua Fighter). Perhaps coincidentally, he uses both Dural and Tyrants as minions in his appearances in Project X Zone.Concept  Seth was originally named Cain, in contrast to Abel. Abel and Cain were the first sons of Adam and Eve, and Cain later committed the first murder by killing his brother out of jealousy. Adam and Eve then gave birth to Seth, who was considered a replacement of Abel; the character was then named after Seth Killian, the former senior manager of community at Capcom who ran the website Capcom-Unity.com, preserving the reference and still explaining the correlation between the two (i.e. as replacement bodies for M. Bison). Outside of that, Seth's name and design has other possible inspirations; his name could be a double reference to the Egyptian God of Chaos, Seth. He may have also been inspired by S.E.T.H. from the movie Universal Soldier: The Revenge. In addition to sharing the same name (S.E.T.H. stands for \"Self Evolving Thought Helix\"), S.E.T.H. is originally an orb shaped super computer similar to the Tanden Engine. A miniaturized version is installed in the head of a super 'Universal Soldier' thus giving it a body. After being shot in the chest, S.E.T.H.s shirt has a round hole in it, reminiscent to the round orb in Seths abdomen. Before being destroyed, S.E.T.H. is covered in liquid nitrogen which leaves him looking completely pale and white like Seth. Both Seth and S.E.T.H. are capable of self determination and consider themselves superior to their 25 counterparts (clones and uni-sols respectively). Additionally, Seth's ability to use other fighters' attacks as part of his movelist may be inspired by the Sheng Long rumor, as Sheng Long was said to have moves from every character in the game. This is also similar in concept to the Cycloids and Ace from the Street Fighter EX series. Furthermore, the basis of Seth's design and fighting style could have been based on the Shadaloo Cyborgs from the Street Fighter animated movie game adaptation for the home consoles as he was originally a nude cyborg whose fighting style was constructed from scanning battle data from Ryu. In one of the endings, the cyborg even wears apparel identical to that of Seth.[citation needed]Personality  Seth is just as intelligent as M. Bison himself, with ruthlessness and evil to match. Unlike M. Bison, Seth is generally very calm and concise, though he displays a fair bit of arrogance, often through his annoying-by-design tendency to laugh and gloat when using his more powerful moves. Seth also demonstrates a deep knowledge of the philosophy of human nature and the pursuits of purpose and self-awareness. This unusual trait, coupled with his endless thirst for power, implies that Seth intends to become his own entity entirely and not be bound to M. Bison as his replacement shell. Notably, while Seth appears to be the only \"sentient\" enhanced being, his Arcade Mode win quote against another Seth implies that at least one other clone may have developed self-awareness. However, his desire for power and his philosophical pursuits are a one-sided and neutral affair; he displays very little (if any) morality or respect for life, and values people only for their usefulness to him. Due in part to his ego, Seth will keep his S.I.N. subordinates in the dark in case they plan to betray him - insubordination is something he refuses to tolerate. Seth is of the belief that any power is good power, as indicated during his fight with Ryu in Street Fighter IV: The Ties That Bind. In addition, despite his philosophical leanings, Seth displays some form of disbelief in the mystic arts; his Arcade Mode win quote against Dhalsim states that if the latter's techniques were truly mystic, he could not possibly imitate them. During his fight with Ryu in The Ties That Bind, he opens up about his beliefs while goading him:Character Relationships  Like M. Bison before him, Seth has made many enemies during his time as both CEO of S.I.N. and the tournament's host.Ryu  One of Ryu's greatest enemies, Ryu despises Seth and vice versa due to their different philosophies on power and on how to acquire it.Juri  Juri sees Seth as a pawn in her attempt to get revenge for the murder of her parents, despite the perverse joy she displays in working for him and brutally dealing with the enemies of S.I.N. Seth is well aware of this as shown in his ending.Story Street Fighter IV series  Seth is the 15th of at least 26 enhanced beings that use data collected from the world warriors to create a deadly style of mixed martial arts. Seth claims to be superior as a result of his humanity, while the others are merely puppets. His storyline indicates that he plans to control the remnants of Shadaloo through S.I.N. after M. Bison's\u00a0apparent death at the hands of his own explosion. He also attempts to use Juri Han, a woman who possesses the Feng Shui Engine in her left eye that his company created who has a vendetta against Shadaloo. She confronts him and unexpectedly offers to work for him, to which he agrees. Seth hosts a World Warrior tournament in hopes of luring Ryu\u00a0to him, and then using his Satsui no Hado to complete his BLECE project, but is dismayed at reports that M. Bison has once again returned from death. M. Bison finally encounters Seth and defeats him in combat, and afterwards tells him that in fact everything that has happened has gone according to M. Bison's plan. After M. Bison leaves, Juri tells Seth that she intentionally pitted the two against each other, but is disappointed that Seth was not more of a challenge for M. Bison. She then crushes his Tanden Engine, leaving him dead and twitching on the floor. One of his brethren is found by C. Viper, she then proceeds finishes said brethren off.\u00a0After the tournament, C. Viper informs her superiors that the \"remaining 26\" are in her sights.\u00a0Whether this statement takes the final bosses encountered by all characters into account is not clear; Ryu encounters what appears to be another \"Seth\" and defeats him, destroying the BLECE machine as well. It is possible M. Bison may have commanded the remaining \"puppets\" to wreak havoc on the fighters in and around the S.I.N. compound, but it is also implied that Juri destroyed most of them.Connected story appearances Street Fighter IV: The Ties That Bind  In the movie, Seth is first seen talking to a scientist about the experiment in the Amazon, wanting to make it commercially viable. Later, Seth discusses BLECE with Viper, revealing that BLECE is used to allow access to fighting energy, which is the reason why S.I.N. abducted the fighters, and are now after Ryu. C. Viper suggests that Seth come to see what Ryu is capable of personally. In a cruise ship owned by S.I.N, Ryu is in a struggle with Seth, and losing. Seth speaks in length about obtaining ultimate power. Ryu realizes that the power he was looking for is not what he thought, and, indirectly through Seth's speech, found his purpose of seeking strength - to protect what is good and fight evil. Seth laughs and tells Ryu his speech is pure nonsense and attempts to attack him. Ryu exhibits his new power, a result of rejecting the Satsui no Hado through his enlightenment (the same power Gouken uses and Ken used earlier, but even more powerful, his eyes glowing blue). His power burns the skin off of Seth's hand, and he defeats Seth with an unstoppable Metsu Hadoken, which burns through the android's muscles for a short period of time. After his defeat, Seth is rescued by S.I.N. members. Seth is eventually cornered by Guile, Cammy, and the U.S Coast Guard. however, A Shadaloo helicopter picks up Seth, with Balrog and Vega on board, the latter of whom tells Seth that Shadaloo is the real manipulator.Comics UDON comics  Seth\u00a0appears in UDON's Street Fighter IV comic, which is centered on the original SFIV newcomers. As #15, the C.E.O. of S.I.N., he sends C. Viper to kidnap martial artists from around the globe to further enhance his ultimate weapon, BLECE. After capturing Dan and Sakura, #15 selects the former as his next test subject, believing that the Satsui no Hado lay within his body); however, Sakura escapes and attacks his underlings in an effort to save Dan. #15 defeats her easily, and decides that she will be the next test subject, when he suddenly hears a noise. Investigating the source of the sound leads him to an intruder, who turns out to be Abel. #15 desires to know how Abel is capable of free will, and Abel wants to discover his true identity. As the two fight, #15 tells Abel about his true purpose and his lack of humanity; though he eventually overpowers Abel and defeats him, before #15 can finish him, he feels a power very similar to the Satsui no Hado. This marks the appearance of Akuma, who believes #15 to be a worthy opponent, and challenges him. As the fight continues, Akuma realizes that #15 has no true soul and uses the Raging Demon on him; as a result of the previously mentioned fact, the attack does not kill #15. Suddenly, the BLECE project malfunctions, and #15's program starts to reboot; he realizes that he's free from M. Bison's control, and decides to go by the name of Seth (having seen the name in a \"book\" he was reading at some point in the past). From that point on, the newly christened Seth begins to devise a plan to conquer the world for himself.Crossover appearance Project \u00d7 Zone  Seth appears as an enemy in the crossover game, Project \u00d7 Zone, where he plays a major role in the game. Seth hacked Alisa Boskonovich's systems to make her a weapon; he also took a V-Dural and mass produced it, creating four Dural stones. Seth also intended to destroy KOS-MOS to get her Vector technology (such act caused an enraged T-elos to join the player's party). With the bioweapons of Resident Evil, he created clone capsules, which were Nemesis T-Type to guard it. Seth planned to take down Juri, retrieve the Feng Shui Engine and use her body as a core for Dural; he also sought not only to copy other characters' moves in order to \"become an ultimate weapon\", but also to capture Ryu and Jin Kazama to use their hidden powers (the Satsui no Hado and Devil Gene) in the BLECE. However, he was defeated for good. In the last chapter, he is revived by the Portalstone, only to be beaten once more.Gameplay Fighting style and abilities  Seth's fighting style is officially refered as \"Move duplication\". He has the ability to copy the special attacks and powers of any fighter.Moveset  In Arcade Mode, Seth serves as the default final boss for all characters; as such, he is powerful enough to provide a greater challenge to them. Taunting at any point or defeating him during the first round increases the difficulty of the battle. Conversely, the playable version of Seth (i.e. #15) is significantly less powerful. Seth employs special powers and techniques from various characters, such as the Sonic Boom and Shoryuken. He also possesses a metamorphic body of sorts, being able to stretch his arms like Dhalsim and teleport similarly to him. Seth also puts his own \"original\" spin on many of the copied moves, explained below. Some of his normal techniques are also similar to those of Abel, as well as Urien and Gill from Street Fighter III.Copied Moves  The only uncopied techniques in Seth's arsenal revolve around his Tanden Engine, and seem to center around space.Trivia Gallery  Seth/GallerySee also References Dan  Dan Hibiki (\u706b\u5f15 \u5f3e, Hibiki Dan) is a video game character from the Street Fighter series, first appearing in Street Fighter Alpha. He is an arrogant, overconfident, and feeble self-taught martial artist that runs a failing dojo.Biography Appearance  Dan has a similar outfit to Ryu and Ken, wearing a traditional karate gi with a black undershirt much like SNK fighter Ryo Sakazaki's. His head and face closely resembles Robert Garcia from SNK's Art of Fighting, while his outfit is bright pink as a parallel to Ryo's usual orange. Supplementary materials claim that his gi was turned pink when unintentionally mixed color (per se, red) whilst doing laundry. His fighting stance is similar to Ken and Ryu's, due to originating as a palette-swap of those two; in later games, it is more \"loose\" and animated. As seen below, his appearance in Capcom vs. SNK 2: Mark of the Millennium 2001 is more distinct in that he's lighter on his feet and his arms are positioned differently. In the Street Fighter IV series he abandons the traditional shoto stance entirely, instead slowly performing exaggerated mawashi-uke motions before transitioning to a parody of the stance used by Ryo Sakazaki in The King of Fighters '97 onward (a low shiko-dachi with outstretched arms). Many of his mannerisms directly mirror those of Yuri Sakazaki. In Street Fighter V, Dan has his gi worn loose like Ken Masters' and he is shown wearing a black short sleeve shirt with a white kanji at the left; his gi pants have a single tear on the left leg.Personality  Dan can be best described as being his own worst enemy. Dan refuses to back down from any fight, usually due to overconfidence, though this easily turns to arrogance or sheer stupidity. Although weak, Dan seems to still be somewhat intelligent and knowledgeable, possessing some knowledge of fighting styles; he acknowledges in Super Street Fighter IV that E. Honda uses moves that wouldn't actually be considered legal in Sumo (with the only other persons noting are Rufus and Gouken). Several games (e.g. Street Fighter IV Volt and Street Fighter X Tekken) has Dan instruct the player basic gameplay and give tips on how to beat certain characters. Despite his miserable record of losses, Dan still believes himself to be the superior fighter; his ego is so bloated that he even sometimes tries to steal credit for other people's actions. For instance, in Street Fighter IV, when being rescued by Ryu and Sakura from an engulfing explosion, Dan announces that it was his \"awesome power\" that saved everyone from perishing. Regardless, Dan strives to live up to his father's good name despite falling short of it. Despite being portrayed as a arrogant and cocky man, Dan is ultimately good-natured and thoughtful; as an example, he says in his Super Street Fighter IV win quote against T. Hawk that he can relate to being homeless and \"totally feels his pain\" (despite T. Hawk not minding). Dan sees himself as a fatherly figure and mentor to his friend Sakura, constantly advising her on fighting techniques, though Sakura doesn't take his 'expertise' seriously, seeing him simply as a humorous and fun guy to be with. He also tends to lecture Blanka, his other friend, about \"real manhood\" and the Saikyo arts, much to Blanka's bemusement; both are close friends, strangely enough. Dan has a deep dislike of Ryu and Ken, mostly on the grounds of them being the more revered fighters and Ken's \"ladies man\" persona. He has also been shown to be quite unpopular with the other characters, usually because they tend to have little patience for his antics.Concept  Not long after Street Fighter II was released, rival video game company SNK released a fighting game, called Art of Fighting, starring Ryo Sakazaki and Robert Garcia. Ryo bore a marked similarity in appearance, fighting style, and name to Ryu, and had the same hair color as Ken. In humorous retaliation, Capcom included Dan as a secret character in Street Fighter Alpha, and many of his characteristics in the series and later appearances were developed to reflect those of certain other SNK characters. As mentioned above, Dan's pink clothing is based off Ryo's orange attire, while his hairstyle and facial features is based off Robert's; he also taunts similarly to Art of Fighting character Yuri Sakazaki. Dan's second costume color for his original costume is orange, a reference to Ryo Sakazaki's default costume. Dan can also taunt infinitely like the Art of Fighting games, whereas other characters in the Alpha games could only taunt once per round. In addition, he has four unique taunts - one when he stands up, one crouching down, a short one when jumping, and a taunt exclusive to one of his special moves, Roll Taunt. Each taunt slightly fills up his Super Gauge in his appearances. Dan's fighting style, the Saiky\u014d-ry\u016b, is a parody of Kyokugenryu Karate, the fighting style used by Ryo and Robert. To further the parody, Saiky\u014d-ry\u016b means \"Strongest Style\", based off of Kyokugenryu Karate's \"Extreme Style.\" Instead of using both hands to unleash his Gadoken as most characters do for the Hadoken; he propels it with one hand, like Ryo, Robert and Yuri do for their equivalent technique, the Ko-ou Ken (Ryuu-Geki Ken in Robert's case). In Street Fighter Alpha 2, Dan is Ken's secret challenger (unlocked by finishing several fights in a row with Super Combos) and they exchange dialog, one line of which is Ken asking Dan if he knows the \"art of fighting\". One of Dan's win quotes in Street Fighter Alpha 3 is \"I hate the art of fighting, but I want to be the king of fighters!\", referencing both SNK series.  In Dan's ending in Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter, Dan's sister appears to prevent him finishing off Cyber-Akuma saying \"Don't you know who he is? He's our...\", parodying the ending of the original Art of Fighting where Ryo was about to kill Mr. Karate before being told he is their father by Yuri (who Dan's sister was designed after). In the SNK vs. Capcom series (more specifically in SVC Chaos: SNK vs. Capcom), Dan's moveset borrows even more from Ryo's, and there is a running gag where Dan is often mistaken for Ryo or Robert, even by himself in a mirror match. He also mistook Mr. Karate for his father's ghost; however, in his ending in Neo Geo Pocket's SNK vs. Capcom: The Match of the Millennium, he seems to acknowledge that Takuma and Go are different people. In Ryo's ending for Capcom vs. SNK 2, it is hinted that Dan came to the Sakazaki's Kyokugenryu Karate school to sign up, which serves as the subject of a few comedic illustrations. Dan's fighting stance in Street Fighter IV bears resemblance to Ryo Sakazaki's stance in The King of Fighters series. Outside of his SNK parody origins, Dan's design could have also been inspired by an official Street Fighter II artwork of Sagat holding a defeated opponent's head; this man wears a karate gi similar to Ryu and Ken, and has a hairstyle like Dan's. Furthermore, it's also possible that the man Sagat is holding by the head is Dan's father, Go, as the man has an orange karate gi (in which, Go is mainly seen wearing) and the hairstyle is shared by both Dan and Go. If Ryu and Sagat faces off in Street Fighter Alpha 2 in the latter's native Thailand stage, Sagat is seen doing the exact same pose above (with Dan this time standing in), whom Sagat promptly throws out of the stage as he assumes his stance. This introduction, directly inspired by said artwork, even has a variation in Alpha 3 and is mostly visible in Versus Mode, in a randomized manner.Relationships  According to Dan-specific win quotes in SFIV and SSFIV, most (light-hearted) characters find Dan \"entertaining\", while others (the more serious) \"can't stand him\" or believe he is \"all talk\". Abel in particular even thanks him for the laughs.\"Allies\" Blanka  Blanka is Dan's only true friend, with the plausible exception of Sakura. Its unknown how long they have known each other but Dan was saved by Blanka at some point before the latter's mutation. Dan always addresses Blanka by his true name, \"Jimmy\".Sakura  Dan's only \"student\" and only other friend beside Blanka. Sakura has talent vastly superior to Dan's but Dan is convinced he is the only one who can bring it to fruition.Ryu  Ryu is one of the fighters Dan despises the most, due to Ryu's popularity and reverence among others. Despite being clearly inferior, Dan believes himself greatly superior to Ryu. However Ryu does consider Dan a friend despite being aware of the latter's jealousy and flaws, owing to the fact that they were trained by the same man.Ken  Dan is jealous of Ken for many reasons; his unending supply of money, his good fortune with females, his superior fighting ability and constant good luck. Dan believes Ken to be a spoon fed rich boy and that real men are hard workers like him. Unlike Ryu, Ken happily exploits Dan's jealousy, as he has no qualms beating Dan up for the fun of it. Ken's family has little patience for Dan as well (Eliza Masters, for example, believes him to be an \"obnoxious idiot\").Gouken  Dan's second teacher after his father and his last. Gouken kicked Dan out when Dan planned to use the Anatsuken arts for revenge. Sadly, Gouken believes Dan is a hopeless man who has no business learning the martial arts, much less teaching them. However, he does show a little concern that he too may be tempted by the Satsui no Hado, despite his lack of skill or talent.Chun-Li  Like most other characters, Chun-Li has no patience for Dan and will gladly knock him out without a moments hesitation if he interferes with anyone's business. It's also clear that Dan has no strong like of Chun-Li either. In his SFA3 post-rival fight against her, Chun-Li wonders how she was \"beaten by such a pathetic style\" after she tries to interrogate Dan.Dee Jay  Dee Jay considers Dan a \"Cool Cat\". Dan, however, thinks his music sucks but wants a free CD regardless.Makoto  Dan sympathizes with Makoto, as both have trouble maintaining their respective dojos.\"Enemies\" Sagat  Dan's one-sided mortal enemy. Sagat greatly regrets Go's death and, despite considering him a nuisance feels responsible for Dan. In the Street Fighter Unlimited series, Dan and Sagat face off, with Sagat eventually accepting defeat and kneeling before Dan so that he can allow Dan to exact his revenge. Dan, however, refuses, citing that killing Sagat would not have been what his father wanted. After Dan gets his shot against Sagat, he's been inhostile to him for the most part, even inviting him to try out his Saikyo style (in Sagat's storyline in Alpha 3 however, Dan is still the vengeful son, while in Dan's own storyline, he has since moved on).Sean  It is not exactly known how Sean knows Dan (or if they have even met each other, as of yet) but Sean has openly stated that he considers Dan the epitome of weakness and hates being compared to him.Story Background  According to the Super Street Fighter IV blog, Dan was born on November 25. Dan's father, Go, was a mixed martial artist and a rival of Sagat. Go gouged out Sagat's right eye and Sagat beat him to death in retaliation. Because of this, Dan sought revenge on Sagat, training to become a fighter, but was expelled from Gouken's dojo when his motivations were learned. Dan thus developed his own style of Gouken's martial art merged with Muay Thai elements and called it Saiky\u014d-ry\u016b, or \"Strongest style,\" despite the complete weakness of his techniques. He set on a quest to find Sagat and take vengeance for his father's death.Street Fighter Alpha 2  In Street Fighter Alpha 2, Dan finds Sagat to avenge his father's death. During Dan's travels, he encounters Guy, who calls his moves \"cute\". Guy then explains he is looking to challenge fighters. Dan accepts his challenge and fights Guy. He eventually encounters Sagat. When Dan taunts him on wanting to make the left eye match the right, Sagat comments that the man who took out his right eye paid with his life. Angered, Dan brands Sagat a murderer, knowing the man was his father. Sagat then comments that Dan should join his father, which then leads to their fight. After their fight, Dan wins, although he doesn't know Sagat let him win, realizing how anger makes people do things they will regret. Satisfied that he finally avenged his father's death, Dan returns to Hong Kong and sets up his Saiky\u014d-ry\u016b Dojo.Street Fighter Alpha 3  In Street Fighter Alpha 3 Dan travels the world, promoting Saiky\u014d-ry\u016b, until Chun-Li comes and questions him and asks if he is involved with Shadaloo. Dan fights her, wins and flees. While back in Thailand, he fights Sagat, hoping to take him under his wing, but refuses. After winning, he meets M. Bison, leader of Shadaloo and Sagat's employer. Dan remembers his fight with Chun-Li and blames Bison for it, who then orders Balrog to fight him. He defeats Balrog before fighting Bison himself, emerging victorious and finishing the villain off with his Hisshou Buraiken. In the ending, Dan turns the Psycho Drive Plant into his Saiky\u014d Thailand dojo, where he and his friend Blanka, whom he correctly refers to as Jimmy, learn Rolling Attack. Later, Charlie, who arrived late, comes with a flight squad and bombs the base, and Dan and Blanka escape. In an unknown time, he takes Sakura, the number one fan of Ryu under his wing. However, while Sakura doesn't seem to mind Dan, he is unaware that she's using him to get to Ryu.Street Fighter IV series  In Street Fighter IV, Dan is shown to be annoyed that he wasn't told of the second World Warrior Tournament, asking Blanka whether the crowds were bored to tears without a star like him to provide real action; in reality, Blanka tried to get in contact with him about the tournament, but couldn't, as Dan hadn't paid his phone bill and his phone was disconnected. Sakura also asks Dan whether he's heard anything about Ryu lately, since Dan has claimed that Ryu was an apprentice of his. To keep up this appearance, Dan says that Ken is rumored to be entering the next World Tournament, which makes it likely that Ryu will also show up. Dan enters the new tournament to spread the popularity of his Saiky\u014d style, barely getting enough points to qualify as a last-minute entry. At the end of the tournament, Dan is seen at the S.I.N. base, bumping into Blanka before an explosion threatens to engulf them both. They are saved by Ryu and Sakura, at which point Dan tells them to be more careful, as \"even with [his] awesome powers\" they may not survive the next wave. He then makes his exit to the amazement of all. During Super Street Fighter IV, in an effort to capitalize on his association with great fighters, he broadcasts a commercial advertising the Saiky\u014d-ry\u016b dojo, telling people to drop in to enroll (his phone is still disconnected). However, when no-one turns up, Sakura points out that the ad didn't contain the dojo's address, whereupon Dan realizes his mistake and screams, which is a point that Poison makes in her winquote to him.Street Fighter V  While Dan himself does not appear in Street Fighter V as a playable character, a message from him under the name \"IamSaiKyo\" appears on Rashid's phone during the latter's character story, with Dan expressing excitement about finally paying his phone bill. He also gives summaries of each DLC fighter available in the shop, as well as alternate outfits and stages. He sometimes breaks the fourth wall in these summaries, such as referencing Street Fighter III in the summary for Alex. Dan appears as one of the simulation fighters in Alex's character story, along with E. Honda and Hakan. He also makes an appearance in G's Arcade Mode ending.Crossover appearances Marvel vs. Capcom series  Dan appeared in Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter and Marvel vs. Capcom 2 as a playable character. In Dan's ending, he prepares to finish Cyber-Akuma when he is interruped by the appearance of his sister. Dan also appears in Akuma's ending, wearing some remains of Apocalypse's armor with the claim that it has changed him, seemingly challenging Akuma directly. Not amused by this, Akuma solidly defeats Dan with a single Goshoryuken while Dan yelps in pain. Though Dan didn't appear in X-Men vs. Street Fighter, he briefly make a cameo appearance in Apocalypse's stage. He was apparently captured by Apocalypse, along with Psylocke. Dan also appears in Sentinel's ending from Marvel vs. Capcom 3.Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo  Dan appeared in Puzzle Fighter II as a hidden character. If certain conditions are met during an arcade mode playthrough using a different character, Dan will be caught off guard by Akuma from behind using the Raging Demon, sending him rolling backwards away from the screen as a reference to his secret boss fight in the first Street Fighter Alpha, and then the player will be challenged by Akuma himself.Pocket Fighter  In the unofficial events of Pocket Fighter, Dan's story begins with himself looking to expand his Saiky\u014d-ry\u016b school, and subsequently chooses Sakura as his student. Upon meeting Sakura, he offers to teach her his style, and she accepts after Dan defeats her in a fight. Sakura masters the entire Saiky\u014d-ry\u016b style, after which writing a letter to Dan commenting on how she has purposely forgotten the entire Saiky\u014d-ry\u016b style, calling his moves \"retarded\", thus humiliating Dan.SNK vs. Capcom series SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos  Dan appeared as one of the playable characters in SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos. He is the only person on the roster to not be transformed by the Red Arremer due to his lack of power.Street Fighter X Tekken  In the debut trailer of the crossover game, Street Fighter X Tekken, Dan is badly beaten by Kazuya Mishima from the Tekken series, during which he elaborates on events regarding the plot. He then gets back up in sheer determination to beat Kazuya. This results in Kazuya hurling Dan across a room and him hitting a wall, thus being defeated once again. However, he makes a non-playable appearance as the training mode instructor. He is also shown to be trapped in Pandora in Sakura and Blanka's ending. Tekken character Lei Wulong has also Dan's outfit as his Swap Costume.Street Fighter \u00d7 Mega Man  Dan is one of the characters that appears in Street Fighter \u00d7 Mega Man. He is the only Street Fighter character in the game that does not appear as an enemy; instead, he shows up as a practice target every time Mega Man gains a new weapon. This \"tutorial\" takes place in an area similar to the Street Fighter IV games' Training Stage, which Dan enters while performing many of his signature taunts. Mega Man then demonstrates the power of his new weapon on him, damaging Dan and causing him to flee the same way he entered.Animations Street Fighter Alpha: The Animation  In Street Fighter Alpha: The Animation, Dan is seen fighting Vega, as well as Birdie in another scene. Dan loses and is brutally defeated in both battles.Other Street Fighter IV Volt  Dan isn't playable in the iOS version of Street Fighter IV, but he gives the player tips before the start of a multiplayer battle.Street Fighter: Assassin's Fist  Dan was mentioned in the Street Fighter: Assassin's Fist third episode \"Satsui No Hado\" with his name appearing on a board of previous students of Ansatsuken. Ryu and Ken are unfamiliar with the name, with Ken asking; \"Who the hell is Dan?\". In a deleted scene, Gouken explains who Dan is, stating that he was his first pupil after Sagat killed his father, but Gouken never finished his training since Dan's motives were for revenge.Comics Sakura Ganbaru!  Dan is introduced in the manga as the self-proclaimed teacher for Sakura, showing her the basics for using chi attacks. In contrast with the usual ineptness and weakness shown in other media, he is depicted as being a quite competent and tough fighter, managing to score a series of victories during a street fighting tournament held by Karin Kanzuki before losing against Ken (who was nonetheless impressed by his resilience). In the second volume, Dan goes with Sakura searching for Ryu, but when they reach Thailand and meet Sagat, he challenges him and Sagat accepts, over Sakura's objections; the outcome of the match is however not revealed.UDON  Dan plays an important role throughout UDON's Street Fighter comic series, he wanted to learn about Ansatsuken from Gouken in order to avenge his father, but because of the\u00a0dark nature\u00a0of the Dark Hado and the\u00a0negative effects that it has on people, he had no choice but to reject his wish. Dan created his own art that was a mixture between Ansatsuken and Muay Thai, he eventually goes to Makoto and her dojo as way to help his dojo grow in popularality. In Street Fighter Legends: Sakura, Dan gets possessed by the Satsui no Hado for a moment accidentally. While dueling Sakura, he gets consumed by this power and kanji for \"father\" (\u7236) appears on his back as he tries to deliver an attack reminiscent of Shun Goku Satsu. In a typical Dan manner, while dashing towards Sakura, he trips on her school bag (turning back to his normal senses) allowing the girl to make short work of him. Later on in the UDON SFIV comic, Seth kidnaps Dan for the purposes of BLECE project which harnesses the power of the Satsui no Hado. In the Street Fighter II Turbo comic, Dan attempts to enter the finals of said tournament by stealing Guy's invitation. Guy lets him get away with it but had the last laugh ans\u00a0Dan is unable to make good use of it since he was beaten by Sakura, after believing he was a contender by default. In the Street Fighter Unlimited Dan face against Sagat who nearly kills Dan, but stops and kneel, admiting his wrong doing for killing Dan's father, apologies and accept death at Dan's hand. While Dan intended to kill Sagat, he stops and admits that revenge is not what his father would have wanted and revenge can't give him what he truly wants, his father back. Dan walk away from Sagat with tearful eyes. When Gill show his true colours, Dan joins the other fighters to stop the mad man. However, their efforts prove futile, and they are saved when Ryu realizes his true potential.Gameplay Fighting Style  Dan uses the Saikyo Style (\u30b5\u30a4\u30ad\u30e7\u30fc\u6d41, Saiky\u014d-ry\u016b, \"Strongest Style\"), an \"ultimate\" fighting style that he created by mixing several techniques, mainly his father's fighting style, unprofessional Ansatsuken that he learned during his short training with Gouken, and colorful taunts of his own. By using multiple provocations to show off, Dan can manipulate opponents to break their pace and lower their guard, giving him the opportunity to land \"powerful\" attacks. Dan appears to to be a jack-of-all-trades with knowledge in multiple fields, but the lack of a specialization (other than his taunts) and his overconfidence makes him weak compared to other fighters such as Ryu, Ken, and Sakura. Dan may have inherited some of his father's moves to use as his own as both of their various attacks are greatly similar to each (for example, Dan's Dankukyaku and the kick Go used to gouge out Sagat's eye).Moveset  Due to his somewhat clumsy, slow and short moves, Dan is widely regarded as a joke character, not recommended to be used for any serious competition. Regardless, he is also popular as a handicap to skilled players, as his weakness makes winning matches more difficult and exciting when against notably powerful characters such as Ryu, Ken and Charlie. As such, selecting Dan can in itself be seen as a taunt, since doing so implies high confidence that a player is superior in skill to his or her opponent. Strangely enough, the sheer comedy value made Dan a campy fan favorite of sorts. Although generally inferior to Ryu and Ken, in some areas he is slightly stronger. For instance, the wide arc his Dankukyaku does makes it very difficult to duck under like Ryu and Ken's Tatsumaki Senpukyaku can. His taunt jump allows him to jump higher than Ryu and Ken normally and it can interrupt in-air attacks. Each taunt also increases his super bar whereas Ryu and Ken's do not. He is difficult to use but he can be better than some of the other characters if used properly. Though Dan is a joke character, he is typically not the weakest in physical strength/normal attack power in the games he appears in. In Street Fighter IV, however, although his comical mannerisms remain intact, Dan appears to be somewhat more serious, and his moves have been notably upgraded to do equal damage to the those of the other mid-weight characters. His buffs and updates to his moves in the more recent games have actually allowed Dan to become a legitimate choice in the tournament setting, to the point that players say that Dan's greatest strength is the illusion that he's supposed to be bad. In the patch for Super Street Fighter IV: Arcade Edition, Capcom has again improved Dan, albeit mildly on a basis of comparison to other characters. Capcom stated: \"In a lot of ways, we are aiming to make this the strongest version of Dan ever in a Street Fighter Series, so we have changed many things\". Despite this, he is still considered to be the worst character in the game mentioned. However, because his fireball still has a short range and rapid recovery, he can essentially fire it repeatedly to gain meter on the ground much faster than any other projectile users like Ryu, Akuma, Sagat, and so forth. Only Dan has this benefit, but it has no practical use other than building meter for Dan to use.Techniques  In the games he appears in, Dan is distinguished from Ryu and Ken by his ineffective special moves, such as Gadoken (or Self-Taught Fist), a projectile with a comically short range, and Dankukyaku, a triple-hitting flying kick that is easy to block; both are reminiscent of special attacks in Art of Fighting (if one had no Spirit Power in that game, special attacks become useless). Dan also possesses Koryuken, an anti-air uppercut (initially different, but eventually mimicking Ryu and Ken's Shoryuken) with very little horizontal range, during which he sometimes flashes and becomes completely invincible. He can also perform Premium Sign, where he autographs a portrait and flings it at the opponent. Dan's Gadoken range has noticeably increased since his last canonical appearance in Street Fighter Alpha 3; it is much more reliable, but at the cost of him having a much slower release. The animation is also different: he extends his arm forward while launching the projectile. Dan has a move known as the Hissho Buraiken, which is a standing parody of Ryo's flying Desperation move, the Ryuuko Ranbu. Dan also possesses a \"Shoryureppa\" type move called the Koryu Rekka, which was borrowed from the double uppercut at the end of Ryo's MAX Ryuuko Ranbu (he even imitates Ryo's \"Kyokugen-Ryuu \u014cgi!\"/\"Kyokugen-style secret!\" yell that is used at the beginning of Ryuuko Ranbu, instead declaring \"Saiky\u014d-ry\u016b \u014cgi!\"). Both moves have little to no range at all, and leave Dan wide open for attack if the moves are blocked. Despite being the lowest tier amongst the main characters, Dan is still an above-average martial artist when compared to typical fighters. In the first volume of the manga Street Fighter: Sakura Ganbaru!, Dan enters a street fighting competition and is shown doing rather well (though he admitted to using underhanded tactics, as he would \"do anything to win\"), only losing to Ken, who later went on to win the entire competition. This seems to tie in to his appearance in Street Fighter IV, when he appears to be more serious, and his moves have been slightly upgraded in order to be balanced with other characters. He gains the new and quite powerful Haoh Gadoken Ultra Combo in Super Street Fighter IV, which is much similar to Ryo's super fireball, Haoh Shoukou Ken. Dan's other Ultra in the Street Fighter IV series is Shisso Buraiken, which is basically his Hissho Buraiken, but he runs towards the opponent to connect. Similarly to the Haoh Gadoken, one can combo into the Shisso Buraiken with the Legendary Taunt. In Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix, Dan retains most of his special attacks like the Gadoken, Koryuken and the Dankukyaku. He also carries a mallet which happens to be the soul of his father Go Hibiki as his long nose serve as a stick on its mallet to knock opponents and a megaphone to shout out on his opponents. He has the most taunts than the rest of the characters with a total of four when Dan does one of his win poses, smacks the opponent by bumping them down to do the same win pose, another of his taunt were he was surprised horribly by shaking both of his cheeks which it was seen as a defeat pose and lastly serving as a Mighty Combo by using various taunts without attacking on his opponent. He only has two disguises serving as his special attacks (Eg. a karaoke singer and cosplaying as the late Elvis Presley). He gains a Shinku Gadoken as his Mighty Combo as it appears in a slow ranged version of his Gadoken as the move can be deflected by his opponents (Like Morrigan for example). He also retains his Koryu Rekka and other Mighty Combos is to summon his father's spirit to make a parody version of Akuma's Shun Goku Satsu to deal more heavy damage and unleashing a powerful blast similar to the Shinku Hadoken whom he dubs as \"Go Hibiki Beam\".Taunts  A running gag in all games that Dan appears in is his ability to taunt, which continues the running gag of parodying Art of Fighting (in that game taunts would remove part of an enemy's Spirit Gauge). In games where the player is limited to only one taunt, Dan is able to do an unlimited amount. Each Taunt also adds to his Super bar, generally (it varies by game) by a healthy amount. In Street Fighter IV, he is also able to perform a special Super Combo: the infamous \"Super Taunt\" (Chohatsu Dentetsu), which is simply a taunt dragged out for several seconds. It does absolutely no damage, and Dan is vulnerable throughout the entire escapade. It takes a whole Super Combo Gauge to perform. This attack is often seen as the ultimate insult, as it shows the player's confidence in victory enough to make him waste a chance at using a super move in favor of this, and performing it under any situation other than total victory is suicide. The interesting thing about this move is that Dan can perform his Ultra during the taunt, and, by starting this combo with the Gadoken, is the easiest way to hit with his Ultra. With fast reflexes, it becomes a bait move for other players to drop their guard, as long as the player has sharp reflexes to pull off an Ultra before he gets hit out of the taunt. Dan is one of only two characters in the Street Fighter series that has a super taunt, along with Sagat: Chouhatsu Densetsu (Legendary Taunt) and Chouhatsu Shinwa (Mythical Taunt). Using Dan's crouching and air taunt in SSFIV against an opponent allows him to attack, but not cause any harm to his opponent. Despite this, certain characters with counters will register them as \"attacks\". Additionally, using his air taunt as soon the jump animation starts increases his jumping height, making possible for him to dodge attacks such as a strong Shoryuken from Ryu, Ken, or Akuma.Parody Attacks  In addition to his normal moveset, which parodies the moves used by \"shoto\"-style fighters, Dan has a move in some games known as the Otoko Michi (Way of the Man), which parodies Akuma's Shun Goku Satsu. The Otoko Michi is performed by doing the command for the Shun Goku Satsu in reverse. Depending on the game, the Otoko Michi can be as powerful as the Shun Goku Satsu, which can take off more than half of the opponent's lifebar, or it takes off a minimal amount of life from the opponent. In most versions, it leaves Dan with only 1% of his own life. Due to its slow speed and high costs, this move is considered highly unreliable and only used when absolute victory is certain. In Marvel vs. Capcom 2, it is the strongest single Hyper Combo in the game, even greater than the Shun Goku Satsu. In SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos, it not only does a considerable amount of damage when used, but he loses no life from performing it: this is due to the fact that it is his Exceed attack, all of which can only be done once per match and needs to be at almost 45% or less amount of life remaining to become usable to begin with. Ironically, Dan parodies even more Kyokugen-style attacks in the SNK-produced games of the SNK vs. Capcom series. He gains the Gadou Shoukouken (a Gadoken-ranged version of the Haoh Shoukou Ken) in both SNK-produced games (as a Level 2 version of Shinku Gadoken in The Match of the Millennium, and a regular special move in SVC Chaos). In SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos:, he also gains a parody version of Ryo's Tenchi Haoh Ken called Kyuukyoku Tenchi Gadou Zuki that is able to block any attack during the charge-up period, even normally unblockable moves, but does not do much damage and has an extremely long recovery time since Dan punches the opponent so hard that he breaks the bones in his hand, and needs some time to tend to it. In Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter, one can input a code just before the start of the match, in which Dan falls onto the ground, creating a comically huge explosion, instead of his normal entrance. He then gets up and the fight starts. This has absolutely no effect on gameplay.Other games  In the parody puzzle game Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo, Dan's joke status yet continues. The gameplay in Puzzle Fighter revolves around setting up large blocks of \"gems\" to be broken, which will then drop countering gems on opponents in complex patterns in order to fill up their screens. Usually these attack gems fall in complex patterns designed to make it harder for opponents to successfully break them up. However, in Dan's case, every single gem dropped is red. This makes it comically easy for an opponent to break them all at once and create a massive counterattack that usually buries the Dan player completely. Perhaps even more so than in his traditional games, choosing Dan is considered the ultimate \"sneer\" to the opponent, since the amount of skill required to successfully play or beat someone else as Dan is so high that it is considered that no player of sound ability should ever lose to someone else playing as Dan.Pop Culture  Dan/Pop CultureTrivia Quotes  See: Dan Hibiki/QuotesGallery  Dan/GallerySprites  Dan/SpritesSee also References Zangief  Zangief (\u30b6\u30f3\u30ae\u30a8\u30d5, Zangiefu, Russian:\u00a0\u0417\u0430\u043d\u0433\u0438\u0435\u0432, Zangiyev) also known as the \"Red Cyclone\" (\u8d64\u304d\u30b5\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30f3, Akaki Saikuron), is a video game character from the Street Fighter series, first appearing in Street Fighter II. He is a national Russian hero who is always seen fighting for the glory of his country.Biography Appearance  Zangief is a massive fighter, weighing 400 lbs and standing slightly over 7 feet tall, placing him among as one the tallest characters in the entire Street Fighter roster. Since his debut in Street Fighter II: The World Warrior in 1991, Zangief has been portrayed with a beard and a mohawk, along with a uniquely-shaped formation of chest hair on his torso and on his shins. His massive frame is almost entirely covered in scars from his bouts with brown bears in the barren and remote area of Siberia. Zangief's wardrobe consists of simple red wrestling trunks with a gold belt, along with red and gold wristbands and his red wrestling boots. In one of Zangief's concept artworks, he wore a tank top and had a sailor anchor tattoo on his left arm. He would retain the tank top in all his Street Fighter II portraits (except Turbo Revival and HD Remix), in order to indicate what color the player chose for him. Starting with Street Fighter Alpha 2, Zangief was adorned with a red cloak that he would remove before starting his matches. The cloak became an accepted fixture of his image, and he was shown with it in the 1994 Street Fighter II animated movie. Although modern 3D interpretations of Zangief have so far not shown him with his cloak, he is still depicted as wearing it before matches in his ending movie on Super Street Fighter IV. He has multiple alternate costumes in Street Fighter V. The first one is a red wrestling suit with a single long sleeve; another is a red tank top with a golden lightning emblem at the center along with the sign of \"METAL\", yellow tights in a rainbow camouflage motif with black kneepads and yellow boots with a red lightning motif. He also wears black studded armbands and a yellow bandana on his head with a matching rainbow camouflage motif.Personality  Born and raised in the Soviet Union, Zangief is an incredibly patriotic character who has been motivated in some way to fight for his Motherland in every single game he has ever been in. While his personality has varied from one media source to another, Zangief is mostly been portrayed as a very fearless and tactical fighter who is prone to quick temperaments, and is always very competitive. He is immensely proud of his physique, and constantly belittles his opponent's smaller muscular build and blaming their losses on their smaller physique. His win quotes often consists of critiques towards his specific opponents about their lack of power, or him telling his opponents to build more muscle. Despite his short temper, Zangief has shown himself to be rather gentle-natured with a good sense of humor at times, once entering a tournament partly to win the admiration of a group of school children. According to the instruction manual of Street Fighter II: Special Championship Edition for the Sega Genesis/Mega-Drive, Zangief is described as being \"good natured, with a great sense of humor, and totally fearless\". Zangief can be easily misled by his overwhelming sense of patriotism for his home country. In Street Fighter Alpha 2, it was revealed that the President wants Zangief to train and fight around the world primarily to boost his own prestige abroad, although Zangief fails to realize this and continues to fight for the glory and honor of Russia, no matter what the reason may be. While not fighting, Zangief enjoys hopak (cossack dancing), and eat borscht. Some of the things which he does not like includes young women (because he views them as a distraction), bears that do not know how to wrestle properly, and (according to the manual for Super Street Fighter II Turbo for the 3DO) projectiles such as Hadokens, Yoga Fires, and Tiger Shots.Concept  Zangief's name is possibly derived from real-life pro wrestler Victor Zangiev, a former Soviet amateur who trained as a professional in NJPW, and who also competed in WCW and UWF International. Zangief's prototypical name was Vodka Gobalsky. Zangief's biography apparently plays upon the association between Stalinist regimes and state-funded athletics programs utilizing bodybuilding drugs following the domination of the 1954 World Weightlifting Championships by the Soviet Union. His appearance was possibly influenced by several professional wrestlers who performed with the New Japan Pro Wrestling Circuit during the time period of Street Fighter II's development in the late 1980s and early 1990's. Specifically, his physique is similar to that of Soviet wrestler Salman Hashimikov, while his facial appearance, including his beard, seems to be a slight nod to American wrestler Steve \"Dr. Death\" Williams, who was a staple in Japanese Pro Wrestling throughout the 80's and 90's. Zangief is similar to the original 1987 version of Birdie, as both characters are depicted as very large men with mohawk haircuts. Zangief is also similar in terms of build and fighting style to Mike Haggar from Capcom's Final Fight series, whose spinning clothesline move he emulates, not to mention that Zangief's alternate costume in Street Fighter IV is a nod to Haggar's costume. There is a theory supported by Saturday Night Slam Masters on the Super Nintendo that Mike Haggar and Zangief know each other as former wrestling partners before Mike became the mayor of Metro City.Character Relationships Abel  Zangief and Abel have a decent relationship, although not really covered in the story. Zangief first meets Abel in Street Fighter IV, which is his rival, believing he is worried and says they should fight, which initially confuses Abel about who he is and what's going on, but after the fight, he recognizes Zangief and is honored to meet him. In A Shadow Falls, Zangief knows Abel's name while Abel is overtaken by Psycho Power as a result of Operation C.H.A.I.N.S. and weakened Abel by making him fight, giving the chance to take him back to Kanzuki Estate and get rid of the Psycho Power.R. Mika  Rainbow Mika is inspired by Zangief and is considered her idol and Zangief considers her a good friend. In Street Fighter V, they became wrestling partners and would've fought together in an exhibition match after Alex won the wrestling championship, but the Black Moon over the city they were at detonated and blacked out the entire city.Laura  Laura and Zangief are wrestling rivals. They first met in Russia, where they fought. After the fight, Zangief gave her a ticket to a wrestler scouting camp, starting her wrestling career and being able to spread Matsuda jiu-jitsu worldwide. Later, Laura fought with Zangief and R. Mika with Alex during an exhibition match, which was blacked out due to the Black Moon.Ed  Zangief and Ed seem to share a certain respect towards each other. With Zangief wanting to train Ed at his gym and Ed admitting to be impressed when he heard Zangief wrestles bears.El Fuerte  As wrestlers, Zangief and El Fuerte are rivals to a degree.Dudley  Zangief has respect for Dudley, stating it was an honor to fight him. Dudley stated that Zangief changed his view on modern wrestling.Story Street Fighter Alpha 2  Zangief is a national Russian hero nicknamed the \"Red Cyclone\". The President promised Zangief the country's full support in exchange for traveling around the world and showing off the might of the Soviet Union (and to improve his image abroad, an objective which Zangief wasn't made aware of). During his travels to prove his Russian might, Zangief encounters Birdie, and the two trade barbs about their appearance. Later, Zangief meets Ken Masters, who calls him a 'mama's boy', angering him and starting a fight. After Ken is defeated, the President appears, congratulating Zangief, who is then sent to train in remote Siberia (albeit with a limited budget). Of note is that in almost all his appearances, the President bears more than a passing resemblance to the real life former Soviet President, Mikhail Gorbachev. However, he is never explicitly mentioned by name.Street Fighter Alpha 3  Under orders from the Soviet President, Zangief is sent to combat the forces of Shadaloo, which is beginning to spread its corruption into Russia. Zangief encounters many fighters along the way, befriending some such as E. Honda and R. Mika. It is believed that he lost to Blanka before he could accomplish his final objective of destroying the Psycho Drive; however in his ending, he and Honda team up to destroy it (the canonicity of this ending is dubious). In R. Mika\u00b4s ending, she followed Zangief as he destroyed the Psycho Drive, and Zangief protected her from the falling apart base. It appears his story is a mix of the two. Nevertheless, the Psycho Drive gets destroyed by someone, at least, and Zangief returns to Russia satisfied.Street Fighter II  He then participates in the second World Warrior Tournament, hosted by Shadaloo, at the behest of the president, but loses. After the tournament, Zangief, dissatisfied with the outcome, returns to training in the Russian wilderness, wrestling bears. Eventually, he is approached by the largest wrestling organization in the world with an eye to signing the \"Red Cyclone\" to their promotion. Zangief at first refuses, saying that he is less interested in money than he is in bringing honor to Russia by demonstrating Russian strength. He is promised a stage to better showcase his skills, with his matches watched by millions. Due to the obvious help this will bring to his will to show Russian strength, Zangief gladly accepts.Street Fighter IV series  Zangief enters the World Tournament held by S.I.N. to prove to his young fans (some of whom are beginning to claim that martial artists are better) that he's still got it. After the tournament, Zangief frantically realizes that he hasn't gotten a souvenir, and says \"I didn't even understand what the last guy was saying before I beat him.\" He then has an idea and takes a photograph holding the beaten Seth (main boss and host of the tournament) in a headlock, which is then viewed by the admiring young fans who recognize Seth as the \"bad guy from the TV.\"Street Fighter V Character story  Prologue: A Red Omen Zangief is shown beating an opponent with a Spinning Piledriver to win a wrestling match in the New York Fighting Tournament. After the match, he reads the latest edition of a wrestling magazine \"Muscle Soul Fighters\", sent by Rashid's servant, Azam. Zangief then flies to London, where he reunites with R. Mika who refers to him as \"Master Zangief\". Zangief wants to test her in-ring strength in a fight, and Mika happily complies. After she is defeated by him, Mika comments on how she wants to follow in Zangief's footsteps to become a \"great professional wrestler\", and Zangief replies by telling her that the only way to properly follow in his footsteps is to have what he calls \"Muscle Spirit\". He proposes that the two embark on a training journey, fighting around the world to build muscle and obtain the strongest Muscle Spirit they can muster. Mika gladly accepts the offer, and the two fly to their first destination, China. Once in China, Zangief meets with an old friend Azam as well as Rashid. Mika is surprised that Azam and Zangief are acquainted; Zangief tells Mika that Azam is the adviser of the \"Muscle Soul Fighters Club\" as he introduces him to her. Rashid, too, is surprised that Azam and Zangief know each other, as Rashid is a fan of Zangief's, having watched his wrestling victories on the internet and remarking that his muscles are amazing in person. Zangief comically challenges Rashid to a wrestling match on the spot, offering to (literally) throw Rashid \"as [a] greeting\", much to Rashid's surprise and terror. After Zangief demonstrates his moves on Rashid, the latter remarks that he was tremendously powerful; Zangief states that this strength comes from a \"great power and dedication of muscle\". Mika also challenges Rashid, again much to Rashid's shock and terror. Zangief laughs, saying that Mika and Rashid should have a great match together. While the two go at it, Azam informs Zangief about Laura's message that he received, reading only \"The usual place\". Azam also reminisces when both are guided by their masters a lifetime ago. Zangief soon notices that Mika has beaten Rashid for not the first time, as she excitedly challenges Rashid to have \"one more match\" to keep working on her muscle spirit as Rashid tries to make an excuse for why they shouldn't fight again. Zangief and Azam laugh, the former remarking to Rashid that fiery spirits help everyone, not just pro wrestlers, and Azam tells him that the spirit that he inherits from his ancestors will fuel his power as a fighter and turn into muscle. Azam's statement confuses both Mika and Rashid, giving Azam and Zangief a hearty laugh. Back in New York, Zangief now teams up with Mika, both in different costumes, in a tag team match. Mika gets extremely nervous, due to this being her first match fighting alongside her hero. Zangief encourages her not to get so antsy, as her muscle spirit is ready for anything as is as well-trained as his own. Mika thanks him, and the two enter the ring.A Shadow Falls  At some point, he and R. Mika (as tag team partners) are in a wrestling match to face off both Alex and Laura. He also faces Balrog and one of the Dolls.Street Fighter III series  Zangief does not appear in the Street Fighter III games, however, it is mentioned in a Secret File that when SFIII took place, he had a wrestling match against Pulk Hogen of the WWCA.Crossover appearances Capcom vs. SNK series  Zangief has appeared playable in SNK vs. Capcom: The Match of the Millennium, Capcom vs. SNK: Millennium Fight 2000 and Capcom vs. SNK 2: Mark of the Millennium 2001.Marvel vs. Capcom series  Zangief\u00a0has appeared playable in X-Men vs. Street Fighter, Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter, Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes and Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes.Street Fighter EX series  He is also a playable character in the Street Fighter EX games.Capcom Fighting Evolution  He also appeared in Capcom Fighting Evolution as one of the playable characters. In his ending, during his training with bears, he miserably visualizes himself going on vacation in a tropical place.Street Fighter X Tekken  Zangief appears in Street Fighter X Tekken with Rufus as his tag partner.Animations and Movies Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie  Zangief appears briefly during a brutal battle against Blanka to entertain an audience of crime bosses, and ends up comically electrocuted by him.Street Fighter Alpha: The Animation  Zangief also appears in Street Fighter Alpha: The Animation; in this portrayal, he never utters a word and merely growls like a beast instead, showing little to no humanity.Street Fighter live-action movie  Zangief\u00a0was played by Andrew Bryniarski in the Street Fighter movie. Here, he was a lackey of Bison's and served as comic relief in the movie, uttering silly lines at inappropriate times; for example, after seeing televised feed of a truck loaded with explosives about to crash into the villains' camp, he yells out \"Quick! Change the channel!\". Zangief was also loyal to Bison, at least until Dee Jay explained that Bison was the \"bad guy\", and had not promised that he would be paid. He also had a long fight with E. Honda and one \"hero moment\" near the end of the movie.Street Fighter II V  Zangief's role in the anime is similar to the live-action film; he is a Russian bear wrestler who frequently works as one of Shadaloo's strong-men. He does not seem to have any particular desire or inclination to injure or kill anyone, but he's not above using his full should his orders require him to. Zangief often wears a loincloth-like shirt in the series. Zangief is first sent by M. Bison to capture Ryu, whom he had seen displaying talents of Hadou on a beach earlier. Ryu resists, and they fight for a while until Zangief manages to knock him out. As they are leaving, Zangief spots Guile watching them from afar. Later on, while Guile and Nash are infiltrating Bison's base, Zangief corners Guile with the intention of killing him under Bison's orders, and the two fight until Guile manages to knock Zangief out with a severe blow to the head. He is not seen again for the rest of the anime.Street Fighter cartoon  Zangief is depicted as one of Bison's recurring lackeys in the cartoon, similar to the live-action film.Other  Zangief makes a major cameo appearance in the 2012 Disney film, Wreck-It Ralph as part of a villains support group, even though he is not a villain within the main Street Fighter storyline. According to the screenwriter, Phil Johnston, Zangief was a source of frustration for him when playing Street Fighter in his childhood. Also of note is that Zangief has played the role of villain in more than a few spin-off appearances, including the movies mentioned above. Zangief makes another cameo in the 2018 sequel, Ralph Breaks the Internet, talking to Chun-Li in Game Central Station as Ralph and Vanellope wonder how he only has hair on his chest and shins. Zangief makes another appearance near the end hosting a book club with Ralph and Sonic the Hedgehog.Comics UDON comics  Zangief has made several appearances in UDON's Street Fighter comics. He first appears during a match in the USA Fighting Championship, overpowering a depressed Ken (who had broken up with Eliza moments before). He ends up defeated when Ken regains his fighting spirit once Eliza attends his match. He later travels the world to perfect his fighting style, one of his stops being Japan. He enters one of Rainbow Mika's wrestling matches and challenges her, ignoring the fact that her match is scripted and his appearance alone ruined everything. Nevertheless, Mika defeats him by pin, all the while unaware that the script had been changed and thinking Zangief was a surprise special guest. Zangief later appears in the Japanese qualifiers for the next Street Fighter tournament. He and R. Mika are put in a tag team against Sodom and E. Honda. Zangief takes the ring after Sodom throws Mika out with a Daikyo Burning and easily defeats him, causing Honda to tag in. A disgusted Vega, who is hosting the match, sends waves of Geki ninjas to kill them, but Zangief and Honda make short work of the opponents, causing Vega to reluctantly allow them to participate in the tournament. Zangief doesn't make it past the first round of the Street Fighter tournament, as he is once again defeated by Ken. He then returns to Russia to resume his training against bears in Siberia.Other appearances Street Fighter EX series Background  Zangief enters any and all Street Fighting tournaments purely to prove his worth as the greatest wrestler in the world and to maintain his reputation as the Red Cyclone. He is extremely proud of his motherland, the Soviet Union, and he is determined to represent it as the champion of each tournament. Throughout the EX tournaments, he encounters an Indian wrestler who comes as close to Zangief's might as anyone he has ever faced. Duly impressed with Darun's prowess, he is excited to meet another wrestler of such caliber and to have someone worthy of practicing with. When the third tournament is announced, they are eager to become each other partners and treat the events like tag team competitions, much to many of the spectators' (as well as some fighters') amusement.Endings Street Fighter EX  \"Comrade Zangief! I'm pleased to learned you won your fight as usual! It was splendid, very splendid! Now, for the love of our country, you will show that strength of yours to the rest of the world.\"\nFrom an admirerStreet Fighter EX Plus \u03b1  \"I am the Red Cyclone! I can roll and crush everything!\" Zangief, the genius wrestler from Russian. When he flexes his muscles of steel, the strenght of his motherland shines even brighter. Today, he went flying high in the air. \"Hmph! FINAL! ATOMIC! Woooooo! BUSTER!\"Street Fighter EX2  We musn't forget that there is a strong nation called Russia. There lives a legendary Pro Wrestler who swung his mighty arm.\nTo make an effort within the international exchange, Zangief secluded himself to the mountains afterward to resume his training, seeking to gain even more power with the help of a \"dear friend\".\nThis national symbol energizes himself everyday with Cossack dancing and his friend \"vodka\".Street Fighter EX2 Plus  To my comrade Zangief.\nPlease tell me about your activities.\nIt's amazing! It's truly amazing!\nThe finest borscht will be prepared.\nAlways affectionately yours.Street Fighter EX3  \"Isn't there anyone strong enough to be a match for me?!\" Zangief yelled this as he read a strange and pitiful letter from his friend.\nCOMRADE ZANGIEF\nYOU SEEM TO HAVE ATTAINED ULTIMATE STREMGTH. YOU ARE THE BEST FIGHTER IN THE WORLD... OR SHOULD I SAY... YOU ARE THE BEST FIGHTER IN THE UNIVERSE!! I'VE ARRANGED A SPACE ROCKET JUST FOR YOUR VACATION.\nBest wishes,\nYour friendStreet Fighter EX3 (in team with Darun Mister)  The stadium echoes with the loud voice of Zangief, \"Darun and me!! We're the best tag team in the world!! Nobody can beat us, you fools!! We are the greatest professional wrestlers!!\" The spectators keep chanting, both Cyclone and Darun names for hours...Gameplay Fighting style  Zangief's signature fighting style is close-range wrestling, with devastating throws and powerful base moves. This makes him tough up close, though he often has trouble with foes with projectiles.Moveset  Many of Zangief's moves are more complicated to pull off, due to the 360 motions input required to perform the moves, making him a character for advanced players. This, along with the fact that several of his moves incorporate spins, is likely the basis for his wrestling moniker \"Red Cyclone\". In addition, Zangief naturally lacks range, and many of his moves have a fairly long startup; this renders him fairly vulnerable to projectiles and makes him an ideal target for many faster characters. Zangief is one of the slowest of all characters in the Street Fighter games, and presents a large target, yet he is widely considered high-tier. As of recent appearances, he has several means to bypass projectile attacks, such as Double Lariat and Banishing Flat, the ability to walk unphased into a hit during his EX Flying Power Bomb, and the ability to grab opponents out of most ground-based moves via Spinning Piledriver. In most incarnations, Zangief is extremely dangerous against floored opponents, as he is able to force them to block regular attacks so that he can pin them in place to deliver a powerful throw or hold. The Spinning Piledriver was the single most damaging special move in the original Street Fighter II series until the introduction of T. Hawk, and is capable of \"sucking in\" opponents from a surprising distance. Zangief's Flying Stomach attack was also the only standard move capable of dizzying a character in one hit in the Street Fighter II series. In Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter, a \"Mecha Zangief\" is introduced. This is an even slower version of Zangief who can't block; however, he takes reduced damage from everything, excluding beam-style attacks. He also can't be stopped, taking only a slight slowdown when hit by almost anything, and picks up a Yoga Blast-like attack, the Siberian Breath. Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes brought Zangief back and gave him the ability to transform into Mecha Zangief, making him more viable against speed characters; he retains this ability in Marvel vs. Capcom 2. In Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix, Zangief retains most of his moves as he gains a new special attack which he does cossack dancing to his opponent in two kicks. He has five disguises serve as his special attacks (Eg: a gorilla costume with a red mohawk, a long haired caveman wielding a club, a construction worker wielding various construction tools, a family man, a jungle man and a red vest with a gray ushanka hat within his main outfit). One of his Mighty Combos has him doing cossack dancing to his opponent in a multiple damage.Super Combo  Zangief has a unique team Hyper Combo exclusive to the first two crossover games: the Double Final Atomic Buster. He runs towards his enemy similarly to his Flying Powerbomb. Should he reach, his partner shows up from the other side, and both leap up past the top of the arena, coming crashing down a few seconds later with an explosive non-spinning piledriver. In Street Fighter IV series, he has a powerful ultra combo called Ultimate Atomic Buster which is a powerful version of Final Atomic Buster which serves as his super combo. His second Ultra was Siberian Blizzard. In Street Fighter V, he has a Critical Art called Bolshoi Russian Suplex, which he grabs his opponent and makes a devastating suplex to crush his opponent down.Quotes  See: Zangief/QuotesPopular Culture  Zangief/Pop CultureTrivia Gallery  Zangief/GallerySprites  Zangief/SpritesSee also References Gen  Gen (\u5143, Gen) is a video game character from the Street Fighter series, first appearing as a non-playable opponent in the original Street Fighter, before becoming playable in Street Fighter Alpha 2. He is an aging Chinese martial arts master and former legendary assassin.Biography Appearance  Gen is an elderly man who often has a stern look on his face. He is among the shortest male characters in the series, standing at just 5'5\". Gen wears a loose, purple outfit with a red sash around his clothes, and red Chinese martial art shoes with white socks. He has white hair with a long, white beard. In the original Street Fighter, he had black pupils in his eyes, not to mention he didn't have the red sash, but in his more recent incarnations, his eyes are now completely white in color. Prior to his recent appearance in Street Fighter IV, Gen had short hair. In the Street Fighter IV games, his hair not only has grown much longer but he also keeps it tied in a formal bun at the back of his head (the bun in the Street Fighter IV series has a traditional qipao similar to Chun-Li's ones, but is completely exposed in Street Fighter V artworks). In most recent games his skin also has aging wrinkles in his entire body, notably his face.Concept  Gen bears a strong resemblance to the martial arts master Pai Mei from Kill Bill: Volume 2, who was based on the famous leader of the White Lotus Clan, Bak Mei. Bak Mei has appeared in many martial arts films by Shaw Brothers Studios; although a master of many styles, he was famous for practicing the art of Dim Mak (pressure point strikes), which Gen appears to utilize. Gen's martial arts style may been a direct homage to classic 1983 manga/anime Hokuto no Ken (Fist of the North Star). His Hyakurenko technique may have been based off Kenshiro's Hokuto Hyakuretsu Ken. The character \u5143 literally means \"origin\" or \"source\". Gen's name is spoken out in the Japanese on'yomi reading; the Mandarin/pinyin reading of the character is \"Yu\u00e1n\" (pronounced as \"Y-wahn/Yoo-ahn\").Personality  Gen is a silent, precise and wise man who takes fighting very seriously and prefers to take on formidable, honorable warriors, such as Ryu and Akuma. Elderly though he is, Gen's temperament is extremely sharp, his speech patterned with a weathered and biting coarseness. With a tendency to muse over death (likely rooted in his condition), he is also not hesitant to speak of such dark matters regarding the inevitable passing of all things, especially to those that walk the path of a fighter, since he seeks to die as he has lived: fighting. Despite being a powerful assassin in the past, and a legend in the Chinese underworld, Gen follows a code and has benevolent intentions, as he never imposes his power over those who cannot fight, nor does he kill the defenseless. Though he fights to test his strength and his opponents, much like Akuma, Gen is very respectful to younger fighters like Sakura and Ibuki, and is displeased by those who do not rely on their own power, as he values the true spirit of martial arts and honor. Another sign of his inner goodness is that he shows a great deal of care for Chun-Li, as he trained her in the youth.Story Early life  Gen was known as one of the legends of martial arts, supposedly being the \"man who killed hundreds\". He was not only a great martial artist, but a legendary assassin known as \"The Devil of Hong Kong\", reputed to be invincible, and whose skills was prominently sought throughout the Hong Kong underworld. Even into the current day, Gen's reputation and might draws out many who seek his presence, be it the world of crime, or numerous aspiring assassins and martial artists who dare to seek his life, but whom are never heard of again. Gen was also a friend of Chun-Li's father Dorai, and he briefly trained her in her youth.Street Fighter  Gen entered the first World Warrior tournament to find worthy opponents. When he did not, he went back to the streets of China.Street Fighter Alpha 2  Later, he was diagnosed with leukemia, and did not have much time to live. Gen did not blame his loss in the first tournament on his illness. At first, he decided he would be careful and just manage his restaurant, but old foes sent assassins who made repeated attempts on him and his family's lives. Due to this, he decided he would stop hiding and go out fighting, in a blaze of glory, as he felt it was a more honorable way to die. He went on a search for a worthy opponent, taking on members of Shadaloo and other crime syndicates, to provoke a fight to the death in which he would meet his demise. Word got around about Akuma, a fighter who fully embraced the Satsui no Hado. After seeking him out, Gen challenged him to a fight that he hoped would be decisive. The two fought fiercely until the end, each surviving the other's finishing blow. However, Akuma sensed that Gen was terminally ill, making it an unfair fight. Thus, Akuma decided to end the match, leaving him\u00a0to his fate.Street Fighter Alpha 3  Eventually, Gen challenged Akuma once again, but although the results of the battle are unknown, Gen did survive. When Gen and Akuma fight during the game's story mode, they perform their signature moves on each other before the fight begins, re-enacting the fight described above.Super Street Fighter IV  Gen is haunted by nightmares where he is surrounded on all sides by the ghosts of those he has killed in the past when he was still an assassin. Scorning the ghosts, he proclaims that while he is still alive, he will not succumb to the likes of them. Reflecting on how Chun-Li has grown into a strong and admirable woman, he knows he cannot protect her for much longer, as his time is running short. He remembers the day when his illness allowed Shadaloo to capture her father; cursing his body and its \"infernal frailties\", he vows not to let them get away. He joins the S.I.N. organized tournament, and at some point Chun-Li finds him and demands that he tell her all that he knows about what happened to her father. Gen refuses and fades away, leaving her alone. When the S.I.N. base is destroyed, Gen protects Chun-Li from the ensuing collapse, though it's not shown how. While partially trapped under the rubble, Gen witnesses Akuma and Gouken fight over an unconscious Ryu, internally referring to the two fighters as \"Life and Death\". He muses that \"Death is indeed strong. Impressed by what he called their \"ultimate battle\", in which both men were \"prepared to give up the ghost\", Gen resolves not to die until their final battle, and so returns to his own \"fight to the death\".Street Fighter V  Gen appears in Akuma's character story in Street Fighter V, locked in combat with the demonic martial artist. Gen observes Akuma's newfound power, and ponders as to whether or not he has become a \"true demon god\", before realizing he has not attained this level of power yet. Gen laughs, stating that Akuma will never reach the path of the divine if he does not know the path of humanity. Akuma calls Gen weak, and calls his speech an attempt to \"delay the inevitable\". Akuma then tells Gen to accept his fate and go to hell, before striking him down with a lunging fist. As he stands over Gen's body, the old man's words echo in Akuma's head. With contempt, Akuma remarks that he has no interest in for the path of humanity or the divine, and only walks the path of the demon, leaving Gen's fate uncertain.Relationships Allies Chun-Li  At one point, he trained Chun-Li in her youth and somewhat treated her as his own daughter, due to his friendship with her father. She however feels Gen is hiding something from her regarding her father's death and sometimes confronts him for it. Despite occasionally threatening to kill her in combat, Gen cares deeply for her.Sakura and Ibuki  Out of all the fighters, the two are whom Gen is more respectful of.Ryu  Having encountered him during his time as a restaurant operator, he became fascinated with Ryu. Gen would eventually test Ryu's strength in combat and held him in high regard.Yun and Yang  While they are somewhat distant and has no known interactions, it can be assumed Gen is comfortable and holds no ill will with them. He is depicted as like a grandfather to the two in the UDON comics.Enemies Akuma  Gen saw Akuma as a skilled opponent who could finally kill him, a morbid desire amplified by his own terminal sickness. However, their skills often clash, giving each other challenges. Akuma however backed down upon learning Gen is fatally ill, but would engage him again after seeing he can still fight. Akuma emerges victorious in Street Fighter V in their last fight, and strikes Gen down, though his ultimate fate is left uncertain.Comics Sakura Ganbaru!  Gen makes an appearance in the manga. He was hired to kill Cammy, who had defected from Shadaloo, fighting against her. Chun-Li, who was nearby along with Sakura and Dan, decided to take matters in her hands and bring Gen into custody. However, Gen was able to quickly incapacitate her by hitting a deadly pressure point on her stomach. Despite her shock and her awareness to the danger the man represented, Sakura steps up to fight Gen While able to effortlessly dodge every attack, Gen became intrigued by the fighting spirit within Sakura, as well as the fact that she utilized the martial art developed for assassination without any negativity in her mind. As he wondered about the \"light\" in her fists, he lost his focus for a moment, allowing Sakura to land a hit. Deciding to finish the battle for good, Gen rushed in for the kill, but allowed himself to stop just one moment early, by a cherry tree leaf. The impact, however, was enough to send Sakura into unconsciousness. Cammy asked Gen why he spared Sakura's life when he was never hesitant to kill anybody before; he replied that, having found the \"light\", he no longer held the desire to kill.UDON comics  Gen appeared in UDON's Street Fighter comic series and in Street Fighter Legends: Chun-Li. He is portrayed as Dorai's longtime friend (despite their being on the opposite side of the law), the teacher of Chun-Li back in the day, and the ward and grandparent of Yun and Yang; a former legendary assassin, he eventually renounced his ways (after killing his would-be assassin in front of his pupil) and concentrated on his opened a restaurant known as Genhanten, which is based off of his stage from Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix. By the time of the story, he is close to death, suffering from an advanced stage of leukemia. In the Street Fighter II arc, Gen is portrayed as the only one, save for Gouken, that at one time managed to defeat Akuma, because the latter had not yet mastered the Satsui no Hado, although he survived Gen's Zan'ei; Gen chose to spare him in hopes of having a fight with both of them at the peak of their abilities. Ryu, seeking for a way to defeat Akuma, went to Gen for help, and he encouraged him to fight back with the same ruthlesness and determination to kill, as Gen felt that otherwise he would have no chance; Ryu refused to accept this, but thanked the elderly master nonetheless. Akuma revealed himself to Gen, and both lamented the fact that their rematch would never take place, because of Gen's sickness; he nonetheless stated that he'd rather die fighting than suffer a long agony, and Akuma obliged him, with the two exchanging a single blow each and parting afterwards. Gen passed away shortly after.Street Fighter vs. Darkstalkers  Gen appears in the comic crossover of Street Fighter vs. Darkstalkers. He helps Chun-Li unlock her hidden power as well as help her friends save their world, despite being deceased by this time. He is first seen as a ghost who fought with Hsien-Ko, only to dissipate as the incense runs out. Gen wanted to teach Chun-Li the killing aspect of their martial arts, but only desperation by seeing her friends attacked convinced her to embrace the killing aspect. Gen's soul moves on as Chun-Li finally wields it, despite her still hesitant to truly use it.Live-action films Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li  Gen appeared as a main character the live-action movie, Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li, portrayed by Robin Shou. Depicted as a younger martial arts master and lacking any resemblance and characteristics to how Gen was depicted in the game series except being Chinese. he serves as the leader of a secret anti-crime organization known as the Order of the Web. It is Gen who teaches Chun-Li her more advanced moves, including the Kikoken, and accompanies her in the fight against Bison and Shadaloo. His back-story also reveals he was a partner-in-arms with Bison in their earlier days as criminals, but Gen eventually left him, no longer tolerant of stealing from others.Live-action TV series Street Fighter: Assassin's Fist  He was mentioned by Gouken in Street Fighter: Assassin's Fist second episode \"Round 1: Fight\" as a kung-fu master he met during his travels who taught him how to use the Power of Nothingness as the foundation of his Ansatsuken art instead of the Satsui no Hado.Gameplay Fighting style  Gen's fighting style incorporates various kung fu styles that he has utilized in his assassinations. As of Street Fighter Alpha 2, this is reflected in the unique ability to switch between two fighting styles during gameplay: Mantis (Sou) and Crane (Ki). The origins of his martial arts style is said to have come from a master who had allegedly tested his style out in the battlefields of the Boxer Rebellions against the British.Moveset  Gen is at his best with both styles utilized in tandem, often switching between Mantis and Crane mid-attack; however, this makes him a difficult character to learn and master, and his low stun and stamina leave even less room for error. Gen's two styles use opposite approaches: The Mantis style focuses on ground-based pressure, spacing, and approaching, with special attacks that can act as solid reversals, among other defensive functions. The more offensive Crane style uses a multi-angle approach, with normal and special moves tailored to confuse and punish foes, and unique standard normals (such as an overhead standing medium punch and low-hitting standing heavy punch). In the Street Fighter Alpha series, Gen and Guy are the among only characters to retain their 'natural' Chain Combo abilities, and both would carry this trait into later appearances.Techniques  The Mantis/Sou-style makes heavy use of linear-motion attacks and pressure point finger strikes, including the Hyakurenko (\u767e\u9023\u52fe, Hyakurenk\u014d, \"Hundred Chained Hooks\") (in which Gen strikes the opponent rapidly with hand stabs) and the Gekiro (\u9006\u7027, Gekir\u014d, \"Inverted Cascade\") (a vertical jump kick with repeated follow-up kicks). His Super Combos while using the Sou-style include the Zan'ei (\u60e8\u5f71, Zan'ei the \"Cruel Shadow\") and the Shitenshuu (\u6b7b\u70b9\u5492, Shitensh\u016b, \"Death Point Curse\"). The Crane/Ki-style involves more mobility, swiping and clearing attacks and unorthodox techniques, including the Jyasen (\u86c7\u7a7f, Jasen, \"Snake Drill\") (a rolling tumble into a forward finger stab) and the Oga (\u5fa8\u7259, \u014cga, \"Wandering Fang\") (a versatile wall-leaping technique with many different ending moves). His Super Combos include the Jyakoha (\u86c7\u54ac\u53ed, Jak\u014dha, \"Snake Bite Opening\") and the Kouga (\u72c2\u7259, K\u014dga, \"Lunatic Fang\"). He also has a crouching heavy punch known as the Kirou (\u5371\u5f04 Kir\u014d, \"Dangerous Tamper\"), one of the strongest counter-hit damage attacks in the series. When Gen is played on X-ism mode in Street Fighter Alpha 3, he loses the ability to switch between fighting styles. Instead, he has a blended style which uses techniques from both styles (except the Oga), and uses the Zan'ei as his sole Super Combo. Due to the fact that he has two fighting styles, Gen is one of the two characters to have two Super Combos in the Street Fighter IV series (the other being Dan), and the only character to have four Ultra Combos.Trivia Stages  Gen's stages often depict him fighting in his city of Hong Kong, away from the public eye in the heart of its city. These often are depicted at its alleyways in the night, or if in the day, in its rather seedy, gloomy, and unscrupulous locations, such as run down and dangerous sections of town, or amidst its ports.Gallery  Gen/GallerySprites  Gen/SpritesQuotes  See: Gen/Quotes.See also References ", "Teen Titans Wiki": "Teen Titans Wiki ", "Terraria Wiki": "Terraria Wiki ", "The Binding of Isaac Wiki": "The Binding of Isaac Wiki ", "Wiki The Flash": "Wiki The Flash ", "The Hollow Wiki": "The Hollow Wiki ", "THE iDOLM@STER: Million Live!

It was originally released in December 2007 for PC and later released for the PS2 and PSP.Plot  Clover no Kuni no Alice starts on the basis that Alice stayed in Wonderland but didn't fall in love with any of the roleholders. However, she is now good friends with all the roleholders from the Country of Heart. Julius and Gowland have stayed behind in the Country of Hearts and two new roleholders are introduced - Gray Ringmarc and Pierce Villiers.The game begins with Alice finding out that she's now in the Country of Clover due to the 'moving'. In Clover all the roleholders have to attend meetings together, hosted by Nightmare Gottschalk, the lord of the Tower of Clover. Also, Alice is able to visit the forest where there are marine animals and doors that talk to her.Characters Introduced Characters Hatters Castle of Hearts Forest Clover Tower Endings  In Clover no Kuni no Alice, there is a love ending for each character plus seven additional endings. There's the two premature endings - Bad End 1 and Bad End 2 which happens if you don't fulfill certain criteria. The other five endings are the Forest of Door, Mafia, Hatter, Rose Garden and Mad Twins End.Opening Movie Music  Opening Theme Ending ThemeBlood Dupre  \u00a0Blood Dupre (\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9\uff1d\u30c7\u30e5\u30d7\u30ec) is the boss of the mafia (The Hatter Family) in Wonderland. He has the same appearance as Alice's ex-boyfriend, which causes Alice to be more self-conscious than usual around him during the early stages of their friendship. In time, Blood's unique personality leaves an impression strong enough on her mind that she starts seeing past that fact.Appearance  Blood has spiky/shaggy black hair that stops short of his shoulders. Depending on the artist, he has light blue to aqua green eyes. Like the original Alice in Wonderland's Mad Hatter, Blood has a black top hat with cards tucked into the brim. One of the cards reads '10/6'. Blood's hat includes six red roses - three on each side. There are also several red feathers/leaves and there are designs for the suits of playing cards printed on the top. The rest of Blood's attire includes a mix of formal wear and a horse-ridding outfit. He has a white jacket with a white vest and a light pink shirt. He has black pants with knee high white riding boots. He has a cane topped with a miniature top hat that can change into a machine gun.Personality  As the boss of the Mafia in Wonderland, Blood is naturally a dangerous person. He is a lethargic and temperamental yet intelligent man who hates being bored and loves tea. He's a nocturnal person, due to his job and the sun, which he considers poisonous. Because of this, he only sleeps when he has free time during the day and is often described as being languid. His hate for boredom seems to dictate some of his actions and his opinion toward Alice. He tends to act lazy in front of Alice despite being proficient in his work and a busy man. Blood is shown to have more knowledge about Wonderland and its rules than the other role holders. If Alice chooses to stay in the Clock Tower, it is shown that he knew Alice's name before she introduced herself. He is also able to read Alice very easily. His mood changes very easily and he is shown to get jealous easily. These aspects of his personality were extremely exaggerated in the manga adaptation of the first game. When he falls in love with Alice, he is possessive with her and overprotective. He is also kind and caring towards her, though he doesn't show it explicitly. In the ending of his non-stay route in Heart/Anniversary, he even goes as far as placing her under house arrest, which later turns out he did because of the risk of assassination Alice was under that he did not want her to know about. One of Blood's weaknesses is carrots. When he's in a situation involving Elliot and carrot-flavored food, he will do anything to avoid eating it, even to the point of running away unabashedly. He also becomes uneasy when Elliot is complementing him and is full of praise for him. In Diamond, Blood is younger and therefore easier to read. He shows emotions more readily and a wider variety of emotions, and he is even crueler, but he is still as languid and easily bored as ever.Background Heart-Diamond  He was originally a faceless child living with his parents and older sister. Sometime after Vivaldi became the Queen of Hearts, Blood became the Hatter.Twin World  In Twin World, it is shown that Blood actually used to be an Outsider. Blood and Vivaldi came from an upper class family. However, the family began to lose funds (due to the mother buying lavish things) and sold Vivaldi to a man rumored to have 'daughters' that mysteriously die or disappear. Upset, young Blood came to Wonderland after wishing for time to stop and quickly adjusted to the life there. Eventually, Blood's memories and intense emotions caused a faceless Vivaldi to appear. This Vivaldi was eventually chosen to become the queen somehow due to Blood's influence. However, the faceless Vivaldi did not want to become the queen. This Vivaldi remembers Blood as a child and does not realize why the current Blood is nothing like she remembers. Blood is constantly struggling with the knowledge that the Vivaldi in Wonderland is not actually real, that his sister is most likely dead, that he was not able to help her, and that he made the faceless Vivaldi queen when she did not want to be.Plot Heart no Kuni no Alice / Anniversary no Kuni no Alice  When Alice first arrives in Wonderland, Blood prevents Elliot and the Bloody Twins from killing her. He is able to immediately recognize her as an outsider and invites her to stay with them. He spends most of his time doing paper work, though there are rare events where Alice finds him doing field work. Alice eventually reveals that Blood looks exactly like her ex-boyfriend which upsets him. He eventually seduces her, leaving Alice to wonder if he's just using her or if this is the beginning of a relationship.Clover no Kuni no Alice  A move brings Alice and the Hatter Mansion to the Country of Clover. Blood personally starts helping Alice grow accustomed to the workings of his mansion. An errant comment from Alice leads Blood to believe that she's using him as a replacement for her ex-boyfriend. At the same time, Alice is convinced that Blood is just using her to pass the time. She has to decide what her feelings are for her ex and for Blood.Omochabako no Kuni no Alice  In the Wonderland parody, the Hatter Mansion is hiding secrets from Alice. Tired of Blood's secrecy, Alice leaves to visit Vivaldi at the Castle of Hearts. There Blood arrives in the disguise of a tailor with aims to win her back. In the Wizard and the Master parody, Blood is the leader of the Hatter Dormitory. His skill as a magician is excellent but he's a selfish and moody person. He likes to act within the limits of the minimum rules and is accompanied by many bad students who don't follow the rules. He likes to drink black tea whilst being carefree as there's no one who opposes him in particular.Diamond no Kuni no Alice  In the Country of Diamonds, the Hatter Family is undergoing a period of growth and for some reason Blood seems to have less composure than before. This version of Blood appears to be younger, and his position is less stable. There is a spy in the Mansion, so Blood uses Alice to lure the spy to complacency in order to capture him/her. This involves him purposefully implicating Alice as the actual spy and even jailing her. Meanwhile, Alice has to come to terms with her feelings for Blood, both the one from Heart/Clover and this one.Diamond no Kuni no Alice ~Wonderful MIRROR World~  When they first meet, Blood quickly figures out that Alice knows another version of him. Unfortunately, he cannot guarantee her safety so Blood refuses to let Alice stay at the mansion, but allows her to visit him occasionally. It is during one of these visits that Blood takes Alice to his secret garden and she reveals that she knows that Vivaldi is his sister. Blood is shocked and wonders how close his other version and Alice are for any version of him to reveal that. He tries to convince Alice to move into the mansion with him, even proposing they play a game where the loser has to do whatever the winner wants.Twin World  This is set after the Heart no Kuni game where Alice gets Blood's best end. Even though they were technically married, Alice still doesn't see herself as Blood's wife. After being warned about the Crazy Storm, Alice finds that Blood is one of the few residents who dread it's arrival. His solution to the Crazy Storm is to have Alice move someplace else. Alice is confronted with the idea that she might be permanently sent away. She has to decide if she wants to be together with Blood, who's mysterious past only draws her in further.Other Media Manga Novel Drama CD's Musical Trivia Circus and Liar's Game  Alice in the Country of Joker: Circus and Liar's Game (\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u56fd\u306e\u30a2\u30ea\u30b9\uff5e\u30b5\u30fc\u30ab\u30b9\u3068\u5618\u3064\u304d\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\uff5e) (Joker no Kuni no Alice ~Circus to Usotsuki Game~) is a manga adaption of Joker no Kuni no Alice.

He is usually seen with a cynical smile and loves riddles. Whenever he sees Pierce he gets hungry and will chase him with a knife and fork. He can jump through doors from one point to the next, an he can even create his own doors.Appearance  He has fuchsia pink hair that match with his striped fur scarf and his tail, which possibly is based on the color of the Cheshire Cat from the 1951 adaption of Alice in Wonderland. He has yellow eyes with black tattooed points under them. He wears a black vest with zippers and a black skirt with a cat head and more zippers, beneath that, he wears a pair of black shorts. They come to about right above his knee and the two legs are connected by a strangely placed strip of fabric. He wears black gloves with hot pink collars on each one, he also wears a collar around his neck. He has a gold chain on his collar to his left-handed glove and another on his pair of black of shorts leading to his oh-so-useful handgun. He also has several piercings on his both on ears and tail (a dead fish), and medals on his fur boa. His belly button is pierced with three tattooed points above it. He wears black shoes with pink and black striped tube socks. In Clover no Kuni no Alice, he wears a long-sleeved suit and a black fur boa. In Diamond no Kuni no Alice, Boris works at the Train Station. His station uniform consists of a uniform that has a gradient pattern of different shades of pink and grey. He has pink gloves, a black hat, an orange accents.Personality  The best immediate description of Boris is that he \"is a cat,\" as he himself puts it. He does not easily grow attached to anyone- this includes Alice. Whatever he finds interesting he plays around with, and whatever he does not find interesting he ignores. Initially his interest in Alice was nothing beyond curiosity, and it isn't until he interacts with her more that they can become friends. He loves guns and fiddling with machinery, although often times he makes things more dangerous instead of better. Chasing mice (particularly Pierce) is a fun past-time for him, and he very much loves fish foods. Boris loves riddles and is clever; however, he does not like trying to see from another person's point of view, nor does he like accepting blame.Plot Diamond no Kuni no Alice  In the Country of Diamonds, Boris lives at the Station, remodeling the trains and bothering the station master who has a weak constitution. He is understanding of Alice's sudden change in residence and is very friendly to her. However, he initially views her as an interesting toy rather than as a friend, just as he did when they first met in the Country of Hearts.Other Media Manga Novels Drama CD's Musical Movie Trivia Quotes  \"But I'm a cat\"Peter White  Peter White (\u30da\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\uff1d\u30db\u30ef\u30a4\u30c8) is the one responsible for bringing Alice into Wonderland. He loves Alice but hates all the other roleholders. In fact he is a cruel and heartless man, but he acts differently in front of Alice.Appearance  Peter has white hair and matching ears atop his head. His eyes are red and are usually hidden behind his round, frame-less glasses. His clothes consist of a pink, ruffle collared button up and a red jacket which is accented by brown trim and white gloves. His tie has a splash of white and blue and a backwards clock design at the bottom of it. Peter's slacks are brown and his shoes are a darker shade of the same color. His buttons are small clocks designs and he has a white handkerchief in the breast pocket of his jacket.Personality  Peter is usually cold and cruel, not caring about anything or anyone, not showing little emotions. Whenever he's around Alice, he becomes extremely cheerful and lovey-dovey with her. Some of Roleholders are surprised by this sudden change in behavior. He tends to be rather delusional when it comes to Alice's feelings for him. He's also rather germaphobic, often shooting servants who touch him.Background  Peter is Alice's \"Sunday afternoons spent with her older sister.\" He watched her from a distance, protecting her happy day spent with Lorina. Alice loved her Sunday afternoons, and for this reason Peter believes that she loves him. He is one of those who is \"closest to the truth,\" along with Julius Monrey and Nightmare Gottschalk; if Alice is ever to truly forget her sister, she must forget him, while being around him will make her happy but make it impossible to forget the time spent with her sister.Plot Heart no Kuni no Alice / Anniversary no Kuni no Alice  Alice first meets Peter when he appears in the garden of her home in the form of a small white rabbit. When she refuses to chase him, he assumes human form aside from white rabbit ears, picks her up, and jumps down a hole with her. She refuses to drink the Medicine of the Heart that he says she must take, and after several failed attempts to convince her to drink it, he force feeds it to her mouth-to-mouth. After Julius Monrey shows up, Peter leaves. As Peter is originally a cold-hearted and cruel person, everyone is shocked that he is so sweet and bubbly around Alice and ONLY Alice. She holds a grudge against him, yet no matter what she does or says, he never stops loving her or treating her well.Clover no Kuni no Alice  Some part during another love interest's route Peter will stay away from Alice but is still love with her but is torn between keeping her for himself or letting another make her happy.Joker no Kuni no Alice  Peter is one of the main characters in Joker no Kuni.

He has a gloomy nature and is rarely seen out of the Clock Tower. Even though he is not a sociable person, he's good friends with Ace. Also, he was involved in the imprisonment of Elliot March and bears a grudge against him. In Clover no Kuni no Alice, he stays in the Country of Heart, but is able to visit the Country of Clover in Joker no Kuni no Alice. In Diamond and Mirror, he stays in the Train Station.Appearance  He has long dark-blue hair that is tied up in the back. He wears a long black coat with gold-bronze designs, black pants, a dark yellow vest, a clock earring, and a clock tie. Julius is often seen wearing glasses while working and holding a wrench or a clock.Personality  Julius is a gloomy, anti-social and a relatively composed person. Unlike most of the residents of Wonderland, he isn't trigger happy and doesn't like to get involved in anything outside of his work because he finds it too troublesome. He enjoys working by himself and likes dark and gloomy places. Sometimes, Julius gets so caught up in his work that he doesn't notice everything else that's happening around him. Julius rarely gets angry but when he does, he's prone to swearing. An example of this happening is seen when Peter tells him that he was the one responsible for bringing Alice to the Country of Hearts. Julius hates rabbits and wishes that he could shoot them all. His hate for Elliot is stronger than his hate for Peter White as he broke the rules once before and broke out of prison. He gets easily drunk from drinking champagne.\u00a0 He works to fix other people's clocks as it is he duty. He cares about Alice very much.\u00a0Background  Julius's role is the Guardian of Time, so he's responsible for guarding time and correcting it if someone disturbs it. It's also his job to punish people who disturb time and break clocks. He sends Ace to find the clocks that have been hidden from being fixed. Like Jericho, Julius is a \"living dead man,\" because he was given his role when, after he was killed, Ace made a deal with Joker to give Julius the role of Clockmaker if he took on the role of the Executioner. He cannot die for good, but he is fated to be killed. The Julius in the games is not the same Julius that took care of Ace. That Julius is dead. Ace moved countries in order to be in a country that had a Julius in it.Plot Heart no Kuni no Alice / Anniversary no Kuni no Alice  Julius is the grumpy, antisocial hermit who lives at the Clock Tower, fixing clocks. When Alice is first brought to Wonderland by Peter, they wind up at the Clock Tower. After Peter leaves, Julius kicks Alice out of the Tower as well, but changes the time period from night to day for her. If Alice chooses to return to the Clock Tower, Julius grudgingly allows her to stay there, even though this means giving up his bed for her.Clover no Kuni no Alice  Julius doesn't actually have a route in this game. He is mentioned in Nightmare and Gray's route as a rival, and in Ace's route as the reason Ace is going insane.Joker no Kuni no Alice  After being absent for the last game, Julius and Alice are reunited. Julius's work room is now connected to the Tower of Clover. He and Gray have similar work ethics and also have a rivalry for Alice's affection.Diamond no Kuni no Alice  In the Country of Diamonds, he is the guardian of the child Ace. He lives at the Museum with Jericho, waiting to eventually collect Jericho's clock.Diamond no Kuni no Alice ~Wonderful MIRROR World~  This Julius is a younger version of the Julius from the Country of Hearts. For unknown reasons, he sent Ace away to live at the Castle of Diamonds while he stays at he Museum with Jericho in order to eventually collect Jericho's clock.Media Manga Main Love Interest Prominent Side Character Novels Fanbooks Drama CD's Musical Trivia Tweedle Dee and Dum  Dee and Dum are twin gatekeepers of the Hatter territory. Their nickname to those not aligned with the Hatters is the Bloody Twins. They also have the ability to turn into adults.Appearance  Dee and Dum have very similar appearances, and if not for their different eye colors- Dee has blue eyes and Dum has red eyes- would be impossible to tell apart in child form if they were to dress alike and speak alike. As they are not identical twins, however, their eye color is one of the ways to tell them apart. In child form, they have short black hair and uniforms that are near mirror images of each other, except that Dee's is in blue and Dum's is red and the chain on the front of the uniforms is identical. In adult form, Dee wears his hair longer and tied back with a blue ribbon while Dum's hair is shorter, black and red barrettes holding back his bangs on one side.Personality  The twins are childishly cruel, yet retain a sort of innocence in their cruelty. This innocence does not extend to their actions towards Alice, for when they grow especially attached to her, they do not behave as children. They like to skip work and kill for the fun of it, saying their are playing with whomever had the misfortune of being their victim. Both twins prefer axes to guns, \"because axes are more fun.\" They look up to people who are mature or who benefit them, but everyone else (except Alice) will be subject to their insults and/or teasing. Because they are young, they are spontaneous and live more in the moment than most other people.Background  While not much is known about their pasts, at one point they were shunned by people for being too creepy. This leads them to expect Alice to abandon them at various times throughout their routes. At some point, they formed a contract with Blood to guard the gates to his mansion. While the specifics of the contract are not clear, they seem relatively pleased with it.Plot Heart no Kuni no Alice / Anniversary no Kuni no Alice  When Alice first comes to heart they get ready to kill her but then stop and fall in love with her just like the rest of the people they call her lady and get mad when Elliot always talks to her When Alice first encounters them at the Hatter Mansion Gates, they come close to killing her before Blood stops them. At first they seem to view Alice as a new toy, then a friend to show off their various toys to. Eventually, they start to try to become someone Alice can depend on, which draws them into conflict with each other. Alice has to decide if she sees them as potential romantic interests or as just little children.Clover no Kuni no Alice  When the twins find her they are happy and call her Big Sis/Onee-san. In their single volume manga Bloody Twins, they enter the bath with her and scare her. At first Alice has no clue who the twins were and was scared to be with them but then they scare her more when she finds out that the older twins are really the same twins she has always known. In the game, the twins often play hooky from the entertainment (the Assembly) and play in town. It is here that they reveal their ability to change their ages and they switch from young children to young men as they please. Alice has to come to terms with their viciousness as adults, as well as their innocence as children.Diamond no Kuni no Alice  In the Country of Diamond, the twins are only adults. Their personalities are the same as ever, but they are far more uncaring towards Alice and do not smother her with affection.Twin World  Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum are replaced by Humpty and Dumpty. Still, Alice has vague memories of them, and occasionally sees flashes of their images.Other Media Manga Novel Drama CD's Musical Movie  Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum are seen running away from the faceless with Alice, who's tired. They jump off a balcony and kill the faceless that are after them. They walk to Alice and say sorry for scaring her and that they didn't want her to get killed and wouldn't do it again.Trivia Crysta Snowpigeon  Crysta Snowpigeon (\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30bf\uff1d\u30b9\u30ce\u30fc\u30d4\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3) is the Queen of Diamonds. Her white pigeon-like name and her neat and clean appearance symbolizes peace but her tastes are far off from peaceful or gentle. She freezes what she likes and stores them in her collection. The number one things she wants to freeze the most are Nightmare and Alice. She is able to switch her appearance between a child and an adult at will.\u00a0Appearance  Crysta can appear as both a child and an adult. She has light silver hair and always wears\u00a0a yellow lily behind her left ear. Her eyes are light yellow-green. As an adult she has a very mature body and possibly is unaware of it; she has been seen squishing Alice into her chest. As an adult, she has light silver long hair but as a child, she has light silver short hair up to the bottom of her ears.Personality  Whether Crysta is actually a child or adult is uncertain; however, her selfish and often rash behavior, as well as her love of playing pranks, imply that she is indeed a child. She strongly dislikes work and will find ways to skip out of it, and when Sidney manages to get her actually DO her work, she often complains. Overall she's very cheerful, and she loves cute things, especially rabbits. She has been known to dress Alice in a bunny outfit like Sidney's simply because she wants another rabbit around. Crysta gets lonely easily, and when she believes someone is going to leave her, she freezes them to keep them around - she can freeze anything instantly, even people, and she adores her collection of frozen things.Background  Little is known about Crysta's background. In a short comic of Sidney's in the Daiya no Kuni fanbook, Sidney noticed when they first met that she was lonely, implying that she did not have anyone who wanted to interact with her and that, like him, she was abandoned.Media  Crysta is not featured in any official manga, novels, drama CD's, the movie, or the musical.Fanbooks Trivia Quotes Joker no Kuni no Alice  Joker no Kuni no Alice ~Wonderful Wonder World~ (\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u306e\u56fd\u306e\u30a2\u30ea\u30b9~Wonderful Wonder World~) is the third installment in the Heart no Kuni no Alice series and is a side story to the first two games.Plot  April season has arrived along with the circus and the four seasons across Wonderland. April season is also known as the season of lies. Whilst Alice spends her time in Wonderland experiencing the different seasons, little by little she gets closer to being captured and imprisoned by Joker.Characters Introduced Characters Hatters Castle of Hearts Amusement Park Clover Tower Circus/Prison Opening Movie Music  Opening Theme Ending ThemeTrivia Gray Ringmarc  Gray Ringmarc (\u30b0\u30ec\u30a4\uff1d\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30de\u30fc\u30af) is Nightmare's subordinate in the Tower of Clover. He used to be an assassin and once wanted to assassinate Nightmare but decided against it after seeing how pitiful Nightmare was. He is a very skilled fighter so Ace frequently tries to \"train\" with him. He is a terrible cook (except for hot cocoa) and has no talent in the visual arts, but he seems to enjoy trying both anyway, although on failing he will get depressed, especially if others comment on how bad something turned out.Appearance  Gray has dark blue hair and golden colored eyes. There is a small black lizard tattoo on the left side of his neck that can come alive and he is usually seen wearing a dark gray suit and jacket combination. There are golden accents on the outfit with his buttons and links as well as on the strap across his chest. The strap itself is brown and also has blue circle patterns along its length. His slacks are black as well as his shoes and the sheathes for his daggers resting on his forearms are brown. The outfit was of Nightmare's choosing and took time for Gray to get adjusted to.Personality  Gray is very mature, particularly in comparison to so many other of the role players of Wonderland, which earns him respect from most everyone around. He is described as kind, and has a love for cute animals; he has rescued everything from cats to flying squirrels to a baby seal. Despite this, as a former assassin, Gray can be cruel if it comes to protecting someone, but does not like this side of himself seen, and will do whatever it takes to hide it. He smokes on occasion, mostly when stressed, and has never been able to break the habit because it is a kind of stress relief for him and he suffers from a lot of stress. In the Country of Diamonds, Gray is an assassin, and he is a lot less mature and friendly than the Gray Alice knows so well. He is harsh and up front about what he thinks, as well as more cautious; he does not show Nightmare respect but views the other as a selfish, spoiled child. Deep down, however, he is the same Gray Ringmarc who loves cute things and cannot cook and is good at caring for people.Background  Originally Gray was an assassin, one of the best in the business. Although in the Country of Diamond he is affiliated with the Station, he did not live there and in fact never lived in the same place for very long, moving about through various territories if his place of stay was ever discovered. He had various \"relationships\" of non-serious natures that he would drop if he moved, but work came first and he never had any real relationship. Once he was hired to kill Nightmare he began focusing on the child Incubus, only to find himself caring more for Nightmare than harming him. A mix of pity and frustration that he couldn't bring himself to kill an unhealthy child kept him around, and after a long period of time denying that he was helping Nightmare, Gray chose to give up his job as an assassin and work for the Caterpillar. According to Gray, he has a distant memory of caring for a child much younger than him, a sickly boy who may or may not have been his brother. Because of this memory, he cannot kill Nightmare, for Nightmare reminds him of that boy.Plot Heart / Anniversary no Kuni no Alice  Gray is only mentioned in passing during one of Nightmare's dream events of a game of chess with the Castle of Hearts in a short conversation between Ace and Nightmare. He is referred to as \"Nightmare's Knight\" and \"(Mr.) Lizard\" and it is mentioned that he would make Nightmare return to work if he were in this dream.Clover no Kuni no Alice  Living at the Tower of Clover with Nightmare, he is first introduced as a responsible and reliable man who assists Nightmare. At times Ace will fight him and his past will be mentioned at random, with Gray himself calling how he acted when younger \"unruly/naughty,\" but for the most part he maintains the mature image. Alice always feels like a child next to him and compares herself to him, also comparing him to Julius.Omochabako no Kuni no Alice  In the Wonderland setting, Alice and Nightmare set Julius' station on fire, setting back Julius' work, hospitalizing Nightmare, and leaving Gray to take up both his and Nightmare's duties. After these events, Alice suggests that she and Gray work separate shifts to watch Nightmare and announces that she is going on vacation. Her vacation takes her to a casino run by Blood. Gray decides the only way to win Alice back is to begin acting like his younger, reckless self. In the magic school setting, Gray is Nightmare's trusted servant and therefore high-ranking nobility himself. He is usually found chasing after Nightmare trying to get him to do his job. As Alice grows closer to Gray, she finds he has less and less time to spend with her. Alice has to decide if she can live with the fact that Gray will always put his work first.Diamond no Kuni no Alice  He is a different Gray than the one Alice knows. He\u2019s returned to being an assassin, and his target is Nightmare. But because Nightmare is so ill, he probably thinks of him as a companion, so he always misses his chance. Actually, he takes him to the hospital just to bother him. He\u2019s the same person as before, but just very different. He still sucks at cooking though.Diamond no Kuni no Alice ~Wonderful MIRROR World~  This Gray is a younger version of the Country of Clover Gray. He is still an assassin, aiming for the teenage Stationmaster, Nightmare's life. However, it's been a while since he was given this assignment as he's trying to make Nightmare healthy enough to kill. Meanwhile more assassins are dispatched to kill Nightmare and Gray has to decide if he wants to quit being an assassin and officially join Nightmare's faction.Other Media Manga Novels Drama CD's Movie Musical Trivia Joker  Joker (\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc) first appears in Joker no Kuni no Alice and is the Circus Master and Prison Director. Alice calls the Circus Master \"White\" and she calls the Prison Director \"Black\". Joker doesn't have a split personality, he's two different people. Though Black seems to be the more dangerous Joker, it has been implied that White is actually the more dangerous one. During April season, he has the power to change the seasons.Personality  As Joker is two people who are one- also known as \"Black Joker\" and \"White Joker\"- they have two distinct personalities. Both have the same jobs, but they have different preferences and are each seen more commonly in one specific job. White Joker is the friendly, smiling Joker. He is the first to be introduced in person and is, in Joker no Kuni, primarily seen in the circus ringleader garb. In Diamond he is the Train Conductor Alice meets in her dreams, and in Mirror World it is White whom she talks to most often at the Lake of Mirrors. While at first he appears the kinder Joker, he is the one who hides his true thoughts more often and expects things to go a certain way- his way. He treats Alice more gently even while he attempts to make her face her guilt and her past. Black Joker is first introduced in Joker no Kuni by way of the mask of White's belt, insulting Alice from the get-go. He is much more open and honest about his thoughts and opinions, and is rude, foul-mouthed, and violent. This is probably why he is the Joker generally seen wearing the Prison Warden uniform. He may be harsh, but he is the Joker whose words can more readily be believed.Plot Diamond no Kuni no Alice  In Diamond no Kuni no Alice, Joker is the conductor who Alice meets on the train. She has the feeling that they met before, but she doesn\u2019t remember. She can\u2019t remember.Other Media Manga Novels Fanbooks Drama CD's Movie Musical Trivia No Kuni no Alice Media  This is a list of all no Kuni no Alice media.Games Movie Musicals Sidney Black  Sidney Black (\u30b7\u30c9\u30cb\u30fc\uff1d\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30af) is the Black Rabbit and the Prime Minister of the Castle of Diamond. Unlike Peter, he hates Alice. He is high-strung and gets irritated very easily. He hates the colour white and wants to paint everything black. This means that he hates the Queen of Diamond's love of white but he is still her faithful subordinate. He's very worried that all the stress will give him grey (in Japanese, white) hairs.Appearence  Like Peter White has white hair, Sidney Black has short black hair. He has heterochromia iridum, with one red eye, covered by a monocle and a black, slightly grey eye. He appears to be a lop ear rabbit, since his ears are always down compared to the other rabbits in the game. He wears a small top hat with the same flower on his chest. He also has one glass lens for his red eye only. The outfit he is usually seen wearing- a white tuxedo shirt under a yellow, pink, and black vest with a large pink bow in the back, black shorts, and long black boots- is of Crysta's choosing. He has been shown wearing much more relaxed and all black clothes when younger. His personal style is probably a lot simpler, in Alice's opinion.Personality  He's a very high strung person who takes everything seriously, often too much so. As cruel as Peter White when dealing with others, whether they be subordinates or enemies, he is not above shooting a person simply because they did not do their job correctly or they said something he didn't approve of. A hard worker, Sidney pushes his subordinates to work almost as hard as him, yet he'll also force them to take breaks so that they don't work themselves too hard. He's the sort to yell and insult a person when he's worried about them and will demonstrate concern over the smallest things. Sidney accurately falls under the category of \"tsundere,\" as he is harsh and downright rude most of the time yet is gentle and affectionate when he feels the need. Unlike the White Rabbit, Sidney doesn't have a hatred of germs, as shown by such incidents as his brushing sweat from Alice's forehead and eating a bite of cake off of her fork. He claims that he hates Peter White above all other people and is incredibly competitive of him, to the point where he will do something simply because Peter did it.Background  He came from a family of black rabbits, but, due to his red eye, they abandoned him, because his nearly blind red eye was a deformity and a weakness. Crysta accepted him when his family left him and took him in, both because she wants him as part of her collection and because she loves rabbits. As he has two different colored eyes, he is unique, and Crysta wants him in her collection of frozen things for this reason. His insistence that he truly was a black rabbit and that he wasn't \"nothing\" lead him to make a deal with Joker, and his hatred of the White Rabbit is because of, or at least includes, Peter's apparent lack of emotions, while Sidney himself feels strong emotions.Plot Diamond no Kuni no Alice  Sidney appears when Alice appears in the diamond castle. She makes a bad impression by comparing him to Peter.Other Media Manga Novels Fanbooks Drama CD's Movie Musical Trivia Quotes Bloody Twins  Alice in the Country of Clover: Bloody Twins (\u30af\u30ed\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u306e\u56fd\u306e\u30a2\u30ea\u30b9~\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c7\u30a3\u30fb\u30c4\u30a4\u30f3\u30ba~) is a side story to Clover no Kuni no Alice that focuses on Alice, Dee & Dum.Plot  Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum are the \"Bloody Twins,\" amorous and affable killers who are able to transform themselves into adorable children or suavely handsome adults.

Can Boris change Alice's mind?Twilight  Alice has become close to Vivaldi. Can she comfort the Queen of Hearts' broken heart?Characters Trivia Vivaldi  Vivaldi (\u30d3\u30d0\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3 Bibarudi) is the Queen of Hearts, as well as Blood Dupre's elder sister.Appearance  Vivaldi is a woman of average height, with dark violet eyes and purple-black hair with six large springy curls. Her lips are usually painted a pink shade of maroon and she has a beauty mark on the lower left side of her chin. She likes to wear elaborate gowns that focus on a red and black color scheme but during Meetings (via the manga Heart no Kishi) she can be found wearing a skirt and blazer ensemble instead and her crown is replaced with a stylish hat. Her most common gown is that of the Queen apparel: A wide skirted gown mainly focused with red and accented by a black bodice and black bows as well as gold heart accessories. With this ensemble comes a giant heart shaped collar to frame her head and her crown with a matching scepter in hand.Personality  She is quite merciless, as well as cruel, and does not hesitate to order the beheading of a servant. Despite this, Alice notes that Vivaldi is very elegant, and even finds her attractive in a way, though not romantically. Vivaldi is understands other women easily. She also likes cute things, such as rabbits and plushies.Background  At the beginning she was a faceless, who lived with her brother and family. But she was chosen to be the queen after the last roleholder stepped down or died. She was taken from her family as a child. Spoilers Below The one we know as Vivaldi is not the original Vivaldi, this one is formed from the memories and feelings of Blood from when he was an outsider. Afterwards she was offered the role of the Queen of Hearts on Blood's request, an offer that she could not refuse. The first person to speak to her after she accepted the role of the Queen of Hearts was the King of Hearts. Shortly afterwars, Vivaldi's first order was to sentence the King's lover to death, which the King interceded in and stopped. Since then, she has continued to sentence both her and the King's lovers to death.Plot Heart no Kuni no Alice / Anniversary no Kuni no Alice  If certain options are picked, Alice can encounter Vivaldi during the prologue of the game or meet her later. Otherwise, Vivaldi will have Alice executed if they meet for the first time half way through the game. Vivaldi enjoys cute things and thinks Alice will be an excellent addition to her collection. She invites Alice to join her for tea parties in both the palace gardens and in Vivaldi's personal rooms. While there are no romantic overtures made, Alice has to decide if this almost sisterly bond is enough for her to stay.Other Media Manga Fanbooks Drama CD's Movie Musical Trivia Anniversary no Kuni no Alice  Anniversary no Kuni no Alice ~Wonderful Wonder World~ (\u30a2\u30cb\u30d0\u30fc\u30b5\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u56fd\u306e\u30a2\u30ea\u30b9~Wonderful Wonder World~) is a remake of Heart no Kuni no Alice featuring redrawn CGs and new character routes.

It is later revealed that this liquid is some kind of way to prevent her from going home. Alice learns that she is in Wonderland and the only way she might be able to return to her world is to interact and spend time with the strange people in Wonderland, which slowly refills the medicine vial.

He tells her to drink some 'medicine' but when she refuses, he simply pours the liquid into his mouth and then kisses her, forcing her to drink it. It is later revealed that this liquid is some kind of way to prevent her from going home. Alice learns that she is in Wonderland and the only way she might be able to return to her world is to interact and spend time with the strange people in Wonderland, which slowly refills the medicine vial. However, Wonderland is going through violent times - everyone is reckless and uncaring as to who lives or dies, and with a civil war going on everyone in the strange world finds it hard to trust each other with an instinct to kill.Characters Introduced Hatters Castle of Hearts Amusement Park Clock Tower Dream World Endings  In Heart no Kuni no Alice, there is one ending for each of the characters and eight additional endings. The first of these endings is the Hatter End, which involves the Hatter family. There are two Rose Garden endings - Rose Garden End 1 and Rose Garden End 2 - which are slightly different from each other. There is a Castle End which involves all of the Castle of Heart roleholders. There are Dead End 1 and Dead End 2 which are both premature endings caused by not visiting certain roleholders in your place of stay, there are two bad Nightmare endings, the Excessive Responsibility End, and the Truth End where everything is revealed.Opening Movie Music  Opening Theme Ending ThemesAce  Ace (\u30a8\u30fc\u30b9) is the Knight of Hearts and is Vivaldi's subordinate. He is usually seen wandering outside the castle due to his bad sense of direction. He is also one of Julius Monrey's few friends. Ace is a warden in Joker's Prison, although he dislikes this job and says that it gets in the way of the work that he does for Julius.Appearance  Ace has tousled, light brown hair and red colored eyes and can almost always be seen sporting some kind of smile. His attire consists of a red trench coat, black shirt and black boots with gray accents along the coat and for his gloves. Buckles also adorn his arms and legs while his sword hilt and buttons are gold. On the occasions of meetings, he can also be seen sporting a red tie and white shirt instead of the black one. While working for Julius, he wears a light beige cloak that is usually stained with blood and a small mask that covers his eyes.Personality  While Ace has a \"bright and fresh personality,\" his darker side is revealed when the land moves to Clover and Julius is not present. Ace can be kind a warm one moment and then, without losing his smile, try to kill a person the next moment. He will even seriously threaten Alice/the heroine when he cares about her. Because of this he is described as a yandere. He is more insightful than he looks, and he enjoys twisting other people's words, particularly Peter's and Alice's. Despite how often he insults Peter and Vivaldi, he never loses his polite tone and manner of speech, always remaining respectful even when what he says is rude. Ace enjoys fighting and likes to provoke other people to fight him, especially Peter and Gray; he always calls this \"training.\" even when fighting the bloody twins he also calls it training. There is only one time that he does not smile, and that is when Alice is in serious danger. He is really scary without that smile.Background  Originally, Ace was a \"role holder without a role.\" Julius took him in before he became the Clockmaker and raised him, the two getting along very well. Ace chose to spend work time in adult form even though he was a child, desiring to be stronger and protect Julius. Even so Julius was killed, and Ace, after killing the Executioner who came for Julius's clock, made a deal with Joker to become the Executioner in the place of the previous, provided Julius become the Clockmaker. Thus their roles were gained. Joker agreed, on the condition that Ace's first kill as the Executioner be Julius, which Ace agreed to. He killed a different Julius in front of his younger self, provoking his younger self to become stronger and starting a paradox of a chain reaction. Ace the child does not know about this, even when Julius the Clockmaker caring for him does. Because Julius wanted to put off the inevitable of young Ace finding out about this for as long as possible, he threw Ace out and made him find another place of residence, though Ace kept returning even so.Plot Heart no Kuni no Alice / Anniversary no Kuni no Alice  Alice meets Ace for the first time in the garden of the Castle of Hearts after seeing Peter. Ace is lost and Alice offers to help him get through the maze to the Castle. (See Ace Route...)Clover no Kuni no Alice  After the move, Ace continues to live at the Castle of Hearts with Vivaldi and Peter. At first it seems like he is taking the move in stride like everyone else. However, Alice discovers that like her, Ace misses the people (or person) left behind in the move. With Julius gone, Alice is the only one left to shoulder Ace's burdens.Diamond no Kuni no Alice  He is a different Ace than the one Alice knows. He still has no sense of direction at all and hasn\u2019t come back from a trip he took. He isn\u2019t at all like a Knave of Hearts since he has the form of a child and is being looked after by Julius, but Alice could have sworn she saw his adult form\u2026?Other Media Manga Novels Drama CD's Character Songs Movie  Ace first is introduced during the ballroom scene, where he kidnaps Alice for his own amusement in an attempt to rile up Peter, and a battle ensues, during which he accidentally drops Alice from a chandelier, which could've seriously injured her had she not been caught by Julius. Alice is later horrified when he reveals himself to be working for Joker, and approaches her covered in blood as she cowers; she was then saved by Blood Dupre.Musical Trivia Quotes References Elliot March  \u00a0 Elliot March (\u30a8\u30ea\u30aa\u30c3\u30c8\uff1d\u30de\u30fc\u30c1) is the No. 2 of the Hatter Family and is Blood's right hand man. He used to be a prisoner in Joker's Prison but Blood broke him out. He is very short-tempered and is quick to shoot at people with his gun, but has a sweet heart underneath. Elliot always insists that he's not a rabbit even though he has rabbit ears (he says he's a dog) and says that he only likes carrot-flavored food, not carrots.Appearence  Elliot's defining features are his light brown rabbit ears poking from curly orange hair. He has bright blue eyes and is both tall and broad, very well-built. Grains of wheat are always stuck in his tattered purple and gold scarf, his long black coat secured with several wide tan belts. The jacket under his coat is dark turquoise, while under that he wears a white button-up shirt. His pants are dark grey and his lace-up work boots are tan.Personality  Elliot is very impatient and violent. If something happens that concerns the mafia or Alice, Elliot will immediately show this side of him. However, like Blood and the twins, he tries to hide this side of him when Alice is near. Because Blood saved him, Elliot believes he is indebted to him. He doesn't get along with the twins because they shirk their duties all the time.Background  Elliot was at one time imprisoned by Julius in the Prison Realm after being captured by Ace (whom Elliot did not recognize), because Elliot destroyed the clock of a friend, one of the worst crimes in Wonderland. Blood helped Elliot to escape the prison. Now Elliot works for him under the promise that someday when he dies, Blood will destroy his clock for him so he can't be replaced. In return, if Blood is the one who dies first Elliot is to do the same for him and destroy Blood's clock. Blood mentions to Alice once that working himself hard for Blood's sake might be Elliot's way of punishing himself, a mentality common among 'sinners'.Plot Heart no Kuni no Alice / Anniversary no Kuni no Alice  When they first meet, Elliot assumes Alice is an enemy and nearly kills her, which Blood prevents. He quickly becomes an older-brother figure to Alice, albeit one who is obsessed with carrot flavored dishes. As Alice begins to spend more time with him, she wonders if his obvious affection for her is real, or just a animal-like love.Clover no Kuni no Alice  The move leaves Alice afraid of being left behind and she focuses her energy on fitting in as a maid at the Hatter Mansion. This includes trying to maintain appropriate supervisor/subordinate boundaries with Elliot. Will Alice be able to accept Elliot as more than just a boss?Omochabako no Kuni no Alice  In the Wizard and the Master parody, Elliot is the vice leader of Hatter Dormitory and Blood's close friend. Alice suspects that Elliot is a magical creature because of his long ears. However, Elliot insists that he's isn't a rabbit. Elliot's usual weapon is a magical gun and he often fires it. Elliot holds Blood in utmost respect and makes an effort for him and he enjoys disciplining the twins.Diamond no Kuni no Alice  He is a different Elliot March than the Elliot whom Alice knows so well. He doesn't trust her, believing her to be an enemy of Blood's and, if she stays at the Hatter Mansion, a spy. He does not wait even 3 seconds before shooting a person and is faster to anger than ever.Other Media Manga (where he is the focus or has a story in it) Novels Drama CD's/Data CD's Character Song Musical Trivia Mary Gowland  Mary Gowland (\u30e1\u30ea\u30fc\uff1d\u30b4\u30fc\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9) is the owner of the Amusement Park.

Whenever someone, Mostly Blood, mentions his name and makes fun of it, he is thrown into a violent rage (as seen in the ending of volume 1). During the other moments while seeing his friends and working at his park, he is a kind person who cares about his friends.Background  Not much is known about Gowland's past. At one point, he was able to keep his first name a secret. Somehow Blood found out what his first name is and spread it around to the general population. Gowland has hated him ever since.Plot Heart no Kuni no Alice / Anniversary no Kuni no Alice  Gowland is the owner of the Amusement Park, one of the three territories locked in a struggle for land.

Prototypes were developed by James Cunningham, Son & Company (Rochester, NY) from 1927 through 1928. Various modifications of the vehicle were tested until 1934. However, the tank never saw mass production. The first American tank available to the player, the T1 Cunningham is popular with many players for its \"bug-eyed\" appearance. It has the second-weakest tier I armor; however, it has the best top speed of any tier I. Although it does not excel at bouncing shots, its high rate of fire guns are forces to be reckoned with for its tier. The T1 Cunningham leads to the T2 Medium , the M2 Light , the T57 and the T18 .M2 Light Tank  NEEDS EDITINAdministrators  Different users have access to different functions of the site.

The M5 Stuart entered production in April 1942. By June 1944 a total of 10,884 vehicles in two variants had been produced. The tank was used in all theaters of war. At first, the M5 Stuart appears to be a minor downgrade from the\u00a0M3 Stuart, with slightly worse armor and lower speed for more hit points. The biggest difference is the ability to equip the fearsome 75mm Howitzer M3. The M5's excellent speed and agility can be used to expose the thin rear and side armor of your opponents for maximum effect. Be warned though, its accuracy is poor, so come in fast, get close, and then get out of there. You can always come around for another pass from a different angle. The M5 Stuart leads to the\u00a0M7\u00a0and the\u00a0M24 Chaffee.M3 Stuart  The M3 Stuart is an American tier 3 light tank. The best-known light tank of World War II, with a total of 13,859 vehicles manufactured from 1941 through September 1943. The M3 Stuart was used in all theaters of war. The tank has reasonable armor for its tier, and the upgraded 37mm gun is fast and accurate. However, when placed in higher-tier battles, it will face better armed and armored opposition. Speed and stealth are the keys to survival for light tanks; the M3 excels in both. Upgrade your suspension and engine and keep your movements unpredictable as you exploit the enemy's flanks, or race to a good hiding spot and help out your artillery and snipers by spotting the enemy as they advance. Avoid long drawn-out, stand-still shooting matches; the 37mm has a very high rate of fire so you can afford a few misses while shooting on the move. The M3 Stuart leads to the T82 and the M5 Stuart.Nazikilla  This is your user page.

On December 17, 2015, Microsoft announced that Deus Ex: Human Revolution would be playable on Xbox One through their Backwards Compatibility Program and immediately added it to the list of Backwards Compatible games, making it playable for everyone who has the game either on a disc or in digital form. A sequel, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, was released on August 23rd 2016, and is available on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.Synopsis  Deus Ex: Human Revolution is set in 2027, just as human augmentation begins to enter mainstream life, and is chronologically the first game in the timeline (Deus Ex is set in 2052, and Deus Ex: Invisible War is set in 2072). Augmentations are not the advanced nanotechnological augmentation used by the two protagonists of the previous games, JC or Alex Denton, they are mechanical augmentation, the type of augmentation used by Gunther Hermann or Anna Navarre for example in Deus Ex. Players take the role of Adam Jensen, a security consultant employed by Sarif Industries to protect a research lab in Detroit. At the start of the game, Adam Jensen is in Sarif Industries' Detroit headquarters taking care of security preparations for the company's forthcoming presence at a National Science Board hearing to discuss the need for augmentation technology regulation. Adam's ex-girlfriend Megan Reed will take the opportunity to announce a revolutionary discovery made by her and her team that will allow people to augment themselves freely without having to resort to anti-rejection drugs, though she seems nervous as to the source of said discovery. During a meeting between Adam and Sarif Industries' CEO David Sarif, the company is suddenly attacked by a group of heavily armed soldiers apparently led by three heavily augmented mercenaries, who use a security plan Jensen created himself. When Adam tries to rescue Megan, he is caught by the mercenary leader Jaron Namir, who brutally beats Adam and shoots him in the head, and the attackers also make sure to burn most of the victims in order to make them unrecognizable. Adam survives by undergoing extensive augmentation provided by Sarif. Jensen is unconscious until after the operation at which point, through interactions with other characters, the player decides Jensen's reaction. Adam is called back to action by Sarif who needs him to intervene in a hostage crisis in Sarif's Milwaukee Junction manufacturing plant, which was taken over by the radical anti-augmentation terrorist group Purity First. Sarif suspects the terrorists might actually be after the Typhoon Explosive System, an experimental military augmentation that had just been scheduled for production at the plant. Sarif's suspicions are confirmed when Adam encounters an augmented hacker in a Purity First uniform trying to steal the Typhoon. Upon being found, the hacker shoots himself in the head while pleading for help, as if doing this against his will. Adam later confronts the Purity First leader Zeke Sanders, who denies any knowledge about the augmented hacker leading Adam to believe that Purity First is being manipulated by a third party. After the hostage crisis is resolved, Sarif tells Adam that the official police reports don't mention any augmentation on the hacker, indicating a cover-up. Sarif sends Adam to the Detroit Police Department morgue to investigate the corpse himself and retrieve the hacker's neural hub. Evidence scattered in the police department reveals that both the Milwaukee incident and the Sarif Industries' attack had crucial pieces of evidence covered up by government official Joseph Manderley. Sarif Industries' cyber-security head Francis Pritchard analyses the hub and discovers that the hacker was a literal \"human proxy\" and thus being controlled by someone else. Pritchard traces the source of the control signal to an abandoned factory complex, which Adam goes to investigate. While there he spots the augmented mercenaries involved in the Sarif attack. Adam descends into the facility and finds a massive underground secret internment camp run by FEMA. Deep inside the facility, Adam is spotted by and fights Lawrence Barrett, one of the augmented mercenaries. After defeating Barrett, Adam demands to know why FEMA is going after Sarif to which Barrett cryptically replies \"You've got worse enemies than FEMA\". Barrett gives Adam an address in Hengsha Island in China before trying to kill himself and Adam by setting off his frag grenades, which Adam escapes from. Adam travels to Hengsha only to find the building mentioned by Barrett under lockdown by Belltower Associates, a PMC and the de facto police in Hengsha. Adam infiltrates the building and discovers that this was the residence of the hacker controlling the proxy, Arie van Bruggen AKA \"Windmill\". By investigating the apartment, Adam learns that Windmill has gone into hiding with the help of another client, Triad crime boss Tong Si Hung. After investigating Tong's nightclub The Hive, Adam learns the location of the hacker. Adam confronts Windmill who claims he was hired by Zhao Yun Ru, CEO of Tai Yong Medical, one of the leading augmentation companies in the world and Sarif's main competitor. Zhao has ordered Belltower to hunt down Windmill after the Milwaukee incident hence him going into hiding. However, Windmill had left a compromising recording of Zhao inside the Tai Yong Medical headquarters as an \"insurance policy\" and enlists Adam to retrieve it. Adam infiltrates the Tai Yong Medical headquarters and watches the recording. In it, Zhao reveals that the scientists' implants were disabled, meaning they, along with Megan, are still alive. She also reveals that Eliza Cassan, the celebrity news anchor of leading media conglomerate Picus TV is also involved. Adam makes his way to the building's penthouse to confront Zhao but she flees into a panic room and set off the alarm forcing Adam to escape. Adam makes his way to Picus TV headquarters in Montreal to confront Eliza. He finds an empty building and speaks to what appears to be Eliza but turns out to be a sophisticated hologram. Soldiers storm the building prompting Adam to make his way to the source of the hologram's signal in a secret sub-basement. There, he discovers that Eliza is actually an advanced Artificial Intelligence, designed to manipulate public's perception through the media but has also gained some degree of self-awareness. Their meeting is interrupted by another of the augmented mercenaries, Yelena Fedorova. After Adam defeats Fedorova, Eliza informs Adam that the scientists' implants were removed by Doctor Isaias Sandoval, the aide of William Taggart, leader of the peaceful anti-augmentation organization Humanity Front. Adam returns to Detroit where Taggart is scheduled to give a speech. Sarif informs Adam that everything that has happened so far is consistent with the actions of the Illuminati. After confronting Taggart, Adam learns that he wasn't aware of Sandoval's actions and that Sandoval is also Zeke Sanders' brother. Taggart directs Adam to Sandoval's apartment where he finds a secret bunker filled with Purity First members, proving his allegiance to the terrorist group. Adam confronts Sandoval who now knows that Taggart knows everything and will seek to distance himself from him and throw Sandoval in jail. Sandoval reveals that he couldn't remove the tracking implants and thus simply changed their frequency to one where receivers wouldn't know where to look. Sandoval then attempts to commit suicide, though Adam can talk him down. Pritchard manages to track one of the implants, belonging to Sarif scientist Vasili Sevchenko, to Hengsha. Nearing his arrival to the island, however, Adam's VTOL aircraft is shot down by Belltower leading to a massive ambush which may result in the death of the craft's pilot, Faridah Malik. Adam discovers that Belltower is on a manhunt for him and that augmentation users all over the world are being advised to have their biochips replaced due to a defect. Adam tracks the signal to the hideout of the Harvesters, a gang known for kidnapping augmented people and extracting their augmentations. Adam finds Tong Si Hung wearing Sevchenko's arm, who states that Sevchenko's corpse was sold to the gang by Belltower. Not having any love for Belltower himself, Tong directs Adam to one of Belltower's ships and gives him a bomb to plant as a distraction. When Adam detonates the bomb he notices that the distraction also allowed Tong's son to escape Hengsha. Adam then stows away in a high-tech hibernation pod. (Note that in the Explosive Mission Pack DLC and Director's cut version of the game, Tong requests that Adam\u00a0rescue his son from Belltower before agreeing to help him) The events of The Missing Link occur between the time of Adam's escape and Omega Ranch. (Stand alone DLC and Director's Cut) When Adam wakes up, he finds that he is currently in the Omega Ranch, a biotech research complex in Singapore. Adam infiltrates the facility and contacts three Sarif scientists in order to stage a distraction allowing him to access the secure part of the complex where Megan is held. Adam also uploads a virus designed by Sevchenko to disable the facility's security to allow the scientists to escape. Once Adam makes his way to the secure sector, he encounters Zhao again. Adam confronts her with knowledge gained from the scientists that the Illuminati are creating a \"Killswitch\" for all augmented people worldwide so they won't challenge their rule. Zhao acknowledges this and uses a remote control to try to disable Adam's augmentations (if she is successful depends on whether the player decided to have Adam get the new biochip or not). Regardless of the result, Zhao dispatches Namir to kill Adam. After defeating Namir, Adam finds Megan who reveals that the facility is owned by Hugh Darrow, the billionaire Nobel Prize winner \"father\" of augmentation technology. Darrow is currently involved with Panchaea, a massive geoengineering facility in the Arctic Ocean designed to stop global warming via iron seeding. She also reveals that the basis of her revolutionary discovery is Adam's DNA, which she has gathered without his consent. At that moment, while giving a press conference from Panchaea, Darrow activates a signal that causes everyone who got the biochip upgrade to turn violently insane (if Adam got the upgrade, Megan uses a device to isolate him from the signal). Adam travels to Panchaea to confront Darrow. There, Darrow explains that he invented the technology to help the less fortunate but it has since become just another means for the powerful to control said less fortunate (especially given the Illuminati's plans to use it as a killswitch for mankind) as well as potentially causing humanity to lose its moral center. Darrow used the insanity inducing signal as an attempt to get the technology permanently banned. Regardless of whether Adam can convince Darrow of the error of his ways or not, he makes his way to the core of the facility to shut down the signal. On the way, he encounters Sarif and Taggart (who had both been invited to the conference) who each propose a course of action for Adam. At the core of the facility Adam once again encounters Zhao who merges with the Hyron Project, a huge bioelectronic quantum supercomputer. After destroying the Project and killing Zhao, Adam makes his way to the broadcast center where he is contacted by Eliza. Eliza explains to him the various options he can take: he can broadcast Darrow's confession about augmentation and the Illuminati thus ensuring that augmentation is permanently banned, he can blame the Humanity Front for the attack thus ensuring that augmentation is developed further (Sarif's proposal), he can blame the event on tainted augmentation anti-rejection drugs thus ensuring tight regulation on augmentations (Taggart's proposal) or he can set the entire facility to self destruct, killing everyone present and letting humanity decide for itself. Depending on various moral factors over the course of the game, the dialogue over the ending can be slightly different, but most of the events remain the same. Although the choice is left to the player, and no concrete information has been given about which one is canonical, both the post-credits scene, and the events of later games in the series imply that Adam chose to manipulate Panchaea's pressure controls, effectively destroying the installation with the weight of the surrounding ocean. When Adam makes his choice, the game ends. In a post credits scene, Bob Page is heard talking to Morgan Everett about the Morpheus project. Megan Reed is revealed to be working for Page on a nanite-virus chimera. It's also vaguely implied by the trophy unlocked by viewing the scene (\"The D Project\") that Adam's DNA will be used as the basis for the creation of the Denton brothers.Themes  Human Revolution deals with the ethics of transhumanism, and carries an overarching message of humanity's reach exceeding its grasp. \"Mankind is using mechanical augmentations,\" director Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Dugas said before the game's release, \"but there is still much to be determined in terms of their effect on society and the ultimate direction it will lead us in.\" The Greek myth of Icarus and Daedalus appears in Adam Jensen's dreams as an allegory to this thought, and also - given that Daedalus was the name of an artificial intelligence in Deus Ex - an intellectual bridge to the original game. The pace of technological development is reflected visually by a Renaissance theme. Characters who support the advances of human augmentation dress themselves and decorate their homes in reinterpreted late-mediaeval Italian style, and the game as a whole has a sepia-tinted color palette reminiscent of historic manuscripts. In contrast, characters who oppose augmentation wear clothing that is more or less current-day. Conspiracy theories and immensely powerful corporations also feature strongly, as in Deus Ex, with the Illuminati playing a key role in the story. Also, a secondary theme of human liberty and political secessionism underplays the game, setting up the events that led to the world of the first Deus Ex. Parts of the game take place during the day, unlike in Deus Ex, but most locations are nevertheless brooding and dark.Characters  Adam Jensen - The protagonist, Adam was a SWAT commander in the Detroit Police, but his career came to an end when he refused to follow a questionable order. Subsequently, Adam became chief of security for Sarif Industries, assigned to protect scientists on the verge of cutting edge breakthroughs. During the preparations for augmentation hearing, an attack by a black ops team leaves Adam critically injured and his charges kidnapped. Adam undergoes mechanical augmentation to save his life, and begins a relentless search for the truth behind the attack. David Sarif - The founder and CEO of Sarif Industries, David developed an interest in machines at an early age. He is known for his forward, honest demeanor, though he has no aversion to keeping secrets when necessary. Megan Reed - One of the lead researchers at Sarif Industries and Adam's ex-girlfriend. Dr. Reed is considered a pioneer in the field of human enhancement technologies. Her dedication to her research, and her aloof demeanor, has made it difficult for her to cultivate lasting interpersonal relationships. During the attack on Sarif she was presumed dead. Faridah Malik - Private pilot of Sarif Industries, she transports Jensen into various missions and locations. It is revealed later that she once lived in Hengsha and that her best friend there was murdered. She then asks Jensen to help her bring the killer to justice. Francis \"Frank\" Pritchard - Head of Sarif Industries cyber-security, Frank has a sour relationship with Jensen, however, he provides Jensen with logistical support during his missions. Jaron Namir - An Israeli-born mercenary, Namir is the field commander of the Tyrants. Officially a senior member of the PMC Belltower Associates Incorporated, he actually takes his orders from the Illuminati. A merciless combatant, yet also a devoted husband and father, he has had numerous cybernetic enhancements to compensate for the decline associated with advanced age. Lawrence Barrett - A former marine turned mercenary, Barrett is a member of the Tyrants. Like Namir, he has augmented his already impressive physique with numerous cybernetic upgrades. He lives for the moment when he's beaten his enemy into submission, and Adam Jensen is his next target. Yelena Fedorova - A statuesque and silent athletic woman of Russian descent, Yelena is one of Tyrant's most elite assassins. Unlike Barrett, she favors stealth over brute force. Being one of few women in a male-dominated profession has strongly influenced her worldview, making her cautious of everything around her. Eliza Cassan - The celebrity-like newsreader for the Picus TV network, she is revealed later to be an AI programmed to control and censor information for the benefit of the Illuminati. However, she shows interest in Jensen and his activities and supports him in uncovering the conspiracy. Tong Si Hung - The most influential crime boss in Hengsha and connected to the Triads, Tong owns a nightclub called The Hive. Tong can help Jensen find the hacker who assisted in the attack on Sarif. Later, he is revealed to be the leader of the Harvesters, a gang who deals in scavenged, second-hand augmentations. William Taggart - A psychologist, Taggart is the founder of the Humanity Front and becomes a leading figure opposing the human enhancements, a cause he took up after his wife's murder at the hands of an augmentation addict. Isaias Sandoval - Taggart's chief aide, who joins the Humanity Front after his augmented brother goes on a rampage and is talked down by Taggart. Ezekiel \"Zeke\" Sanders - A former augmented soldier and Isaias's brother, he becomes the leader of the radical anti-augmentation group known as Purity First and leads the attack on a Sarif manufacturing plant. Zhao Yun Ru - CEO of Tai Yong Medical and member of the Illuminati. Her company is attempting to take control of the global augmentation market. Hugh Darrow - The father of augmentation, winner of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine and CEO of Darrow Industries; currently overseeing the construction of the Panchaea installation to help control global warming. Seen as a hero by David Sarif and Megan Reed, however, it is revealed that he regrets creating augmentations and plans to end biomodification in a sinister and frightening way. Bob Page - Owner of Page Industries, CEO of VersaLife\u00a0and member of the Council of Five of the Illuminati.Corporations Factions World locations District Gameplay Difficulty  There are 3, from easiest to hardest: 'Tell Me a Story', 'Give Me a Challenge' and 'Give me Deus Ex'. Each difficulty above 'Tell Me a Story' increases the damage you take and decreases the damage enemies take, slows down your health regen and increases the delay before your health regenerates (but does the same to the enemy) and increases enemy accuracy. On Give me Deus Ex if you alert an enemy then other enemies nearby will also be alerted. Additionally, the crosshair, objective markers and Augmented Reality are automatically turned off (they can be turned back on without an effect on the \"Legend\" trophy/achievement, though).Augmentations  The augmentations in Deus Ex: Human Revolution are mechanical. There are 21 total available mechanical augmentations, but almost all of them can be upgraded further. The mechanical augmentations are either passive or active; the latter require energy to run (or activate), the former are always in effect and require no energy. When the player gains access to the augmentations some of them will be already unlocked, for example the Infolink. To unlock new mechanical augmentations, the player will need Praxis points. Praxis points can be very rarely found in the game world in the form of Praxis kits, which can be bought from LIMB clinics, though the supply is limited. After amassing 5000 experience points, the player will be rewarded with one Praxis point. Unlike the previous games, the augmentations are never mutually exclusive.Combat  Aiming and weapon accuracy is no longer affected by player character statistics in Human Revolution, though recoil can be reduced by arm augmentations and a weapon's stats affect its damage output. Weapons use distinct ammo types, unlike the unified ammo of Invisible War, and are broadly similar to modern-day armaments. They can be upgraded as the game progresses, and some can be recombined: for instance, instead of LAM or EMP grenades simply sticking to walls, the player must first combine a normal grenade with a 'wall-mount' device.  Damage is 'high': a few bullets are enough to kill either an NPC or the player. Human Revolution uses the regenerating health model that is popular in contemporary games design. Eidos didn't want players to reach a situation where they were unable to progress due to low health, and would be forced to \"scrounge for med packs\", which they see as tension- and flow-breaking. They believe regenerating health will still encourage tactics and strategy without disrupting play for medkit back-tracking. Enemy squads have identifiable leaders who organize the group's actions. If the leader is killed the squad will be less effective and less able to respond to changes in the player's tactics. Adam has a series of 'takedown' moves which can be triggered at appropriate points. These are short third-person sequences that show him knocking out or killing the target with a contextual animation; examples range from stabbing guards with the arm blades to tapping someone on the shoulder and punching them out when they turn round.Stealth and cover  A cover hugging system is in place in Human Revolution, though it can be ignored if the player desires. While the cover button is held Adam will attach to the nearest sensible surface and the camera will switch to third-person which is very similar to the cover system used by Rainbow Six Vegas and its sequel. Adam can remain in cover while turning corners by holding a button that switches cover when prompted. He may also move from cover to cover, but an enemy looking towards him while he shifts may be alerted to his presence. An option is available to allow cover to be a toggle rather than a press and hold. Cover is more important than in the previous two games because it is the only way to avoid detection when sneaking. Low lighting levels can no longer reliably hide the player from NPCs. Noise can also bring unwanted attention. There is a cloaking augmentation in the game, and there is also an x-ray vision ability. Additional stealth augmentations allow the player to see the range at which noises Adam makes are detectable by enemies, see the enemy cones of vision on the radar, and mark up to seven enemies at once so the player can keep track of their exact positions. Much of the stealth mechanics have been borrowed from other stealth action games, namely, the Metal Gear Solid and Splinter Cell series.Hacking  Hacking in Human Revolution takes the form of a puzzle-action minigame with similarities to Uplink, and is done in real time. The player must traverse a network of various computer nodes in order to reach the final node which, when captured, will mean a successful hack. When capturing a node, there is a risk of being detected by the system; when detected, the player has limited amount of time before being tracked down and failing the hack. There is a limit on how many times you may try to hack every device, and after a failed hack the device is under lockdown and cannot be used for a short period of time. The player can reduce the chance of being detected and slow down the tracking process with various augmentations and software. There are no multitools or lockpicks in the game. However there are few types of computer software which can be used during hacking, as well as auto-hack tools.Social  Some conversations can be 'lost' in Human Revolution, meaning that the NPC refuses to give you the information you want - even to talk with you again. They progress not by the player picking from a set of lines seen on-screen, but by picking from one of three emotional stances to take. If the player upgrades their social augmentations, they can deduce personality traits from NPC speech that helps to determine the best possible response, as well as exuding chemical pheromones to make an NPC more agreeable. In addition to that, there are \"social boss battles\": lengthy discussions, in which the player is required to choose arguments. Correct answers result in a \"convinced\" meter going up and vice versa. Too many failures lead to a failed conversation, closing some content from the players or one path of approach to a target.Development  It was announced on May 17, 2007, by IGN in an interview with Patrick Melchior, the director of Eidos France, on the French-Canadian television station, MusiquePlus. Neither Warren Spector nor Harvey Smith, the main creative directors behind the first two games, were attached to the project. Further confirming the game's development, Eidos Montr\u00e9al's general manager St\u00e9phane D\u2019Astous reported that they have received a \"huge mandate\" to focus on the creation of Deus Ex 3. In the same report, D\u2019Astous expounded upon the development philosophy being implemented at the new studio. The philosophy focuses on smaller teams with multi-discipline employees. While embraced by the designers, this philosophy meant\u00a0that Deus Ex 3 had been\u00a0scheduled to develop for at least 18 months, if not 24 or more, which put\u00a0the earliest release date in the middle of 2009. The last bit of information D'Astous divulged was that Deus Ex 3 had just passed proof of concept, as of late November 2007. A teaser trailer was released on November 26, 2007. The 200th issue of PC Zone Magazine revealed the conspiracy of Deus Ex 3 along with information and artwork/screenshots. Several design decisions were unveiled, such as regenerating health and a cover system, precipitating an initial backlash amongst many fans of Deus Ex. Some concept art and early screenshots had been provided for PC Zone's first preview, but it was not until a Square Enix-produced CGI teaser trailer was shown at the 2010 Game Developers Conference that another glimpse of the game's visual style was shown. The teaser was expanded to a three-minute trailer at E3 2010 (still all pre-rendered) which coincided with a second preview in PC Gamer UK containing new screenshots and gameplay details, and announced that the game will not be coming out until \"Early 2011\". E3 2010 also saw a second major preview of the game, this time in PC Gamer UK, which provided engine-rendered screenshots and gameplay details. In July 2010, Del Rey Books announced a novel, based in the universe of Deus Ex, named Deus Ex: Icarus Effect. Its story introduces the reader into the Human Revolution storyline. It was written by James Swallow and was released on February 22nd, 2011. During the Tokyo Game Show 2010 a new trailer was released. The trailer was the same at the E3 but with new scene and revealing a new characters, with Japanese voice actors; at the same time Square Enix, Inc., has revealed today a new premium-quality action figure based on the central character from Deus Ex: Human Revolution, Adam Jensen. Deus Ex: Human Revolution Play Arts -Kai- will be the latest addition to the Play Arts -Kai- series, and will feature newly-augmented Adam Jensen and even more. Frank Lapikas, game designer on DX:HR, confirmed 3 difficulty levels: Casual, Normal and 'Deus Ex'. The PC version of DX:HR will feature DirectX 11 support for improved visuals. It will have more advanced AI to compensate for the precision offered by the mouse, in addition to optimized controls, and a unique UI tailored to the platform. Deus Ex: Human Revolution is targeted for release on August 23 in North America, and August 26 in Europe.  In 30, November Square Enix announced the Deus Ex: Human Revolution Augmented Edition, available early 2011 for $69.99 ($59.99 PC), bundles the game inside some rather attractive premium packaging, along with a 40-page art book, a motion graphic novel, a making-of DVD, and the game's soundtrack. More bonuses come to those that preorder the game at participating retailers. Putting money down at a retailer that isn't GameStop will score players the Tactical Enhancement Pack, which comes with a Huntsman Silverback Double-Barrel Shotgun, the Longsword Whisperhead Extreme Range Sniper Rifle, and extra credits to spend in game. GameStop preorders will secure the Explosive Mission Pack, packed with a Linebacker G-87 multiple shot grenade launcher, the M-28 Utility Remote-Detonated Explosive Device, an automatic unlocking device, and an entirely new mission to play through, featuring a cameo by a character from the original Deus Ex.Film Adaptation  On 12 July 2012, it was announced that a film adaptation based on the game was being planned by Eidos Montreal and CBS Films, who secured the film rights to the game. On 15 November 2012, it was announced that Scott Derrickson would be directing the film as well as co-writing the script with C. Robert Cargill, who also worked with Derrickson on Sinister. In the same article, it was revealed that Roy Lee and Adrian Askarieh would be the film's producers, and John P. Middleton would be executive-producer. In February 2013, Square Enix registered the trademark Deus Ex: Human Defiance in Europe, which turned out to be the film version of Human Revolution.Behind the scenes References to the original Deus Ex System Requirements PC Version  The PC version of the game has specific features, simply to improve the aesthetics of the game.Mac Version  The Mac version of the game is the \"Ultimate Edition\" that contains all previously released DLC and extra content including The Missing Link. The game contains:Gallery Gameplay  The three difficulty levels - Tell me a story, Give me a challenge, Give me Deus ExExternal links References Adam Jensen  Adam Jensen is the mechanically augmented protagonist of Deus Ex: Human Revolution, in which he works as the Chief of Security for the biotechnology company Sarif Industries, and Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, in which he is an operative of Task Force 29 aiming to hunt down and capture augmented terrorists while also working for the Juggernaut Collective.Biography Early life  Adam Jensen was born on March 9, 1993. At a very young age, he was one of a group of infants subjected to experimental genetic therapy treatments by White Helix Labs, a subsidiary of VersaLife. All of the children, aside from Jensen, died as a result of the treatments. Two scientists in charge of Adam found out they had succeeded with him, but had grown too attached to let VersaLife continue experimenting on him. Not wanting any more children to undergo the same treatments, they burned down the facility where the experiments had taken place. They were later murdered by the Illuminati and reported as fire casualties, but their plan worked, and infant Jensen was rescued by a kind-hearted nurse named Michelle Walthers. Walthers was acquainted with a couple who desired a child and at age five he was unofficially adopted by loving parents, Arthur and Margie Jensen. With his adopted parents, Jensen was raised in a blue-collar neighborhood in Detroit and was a B-average student with no notable youthful indiscretions. Relying solely on Arthur's income, money was always tight for the family; Margie lacked the skills and emotional temperament needed to maintain a job. When Margie lost a job she would pull Adam from school to go on \"an adventure\" they could not afford--these outings were some of Adam's happiest memories but were also tinged with guilt and uncertainty. He grew up unaware of his origins, and believing that his adopted parents were his birth parents. His relationship with his parents and adopted family appears to have been good as, in Jensen's apartment in Detroit, an old photograph of relatives is seen hanging in the living room. While Jensen does not speak often of his parents, he does mention that his mother sometimes kept him waiting, and would not want to see him in a brothel. While Jensen had escaped White Helix Labs, its legacy had altered his life forever. Unbeknownst to Walthers, Jensen, or anyone else, the White Helix gene therapy had permanently altered Jensen's biochemistry. His body would not reject PEDOT electrodes with glial tissue buildup; if anything, the bond between tissue and electrode would strengthen with time, possibly without limit. If he were to be augmented, he would not require Neuropozyne. For the thirty years that followed the White Helix experiment, Jensen would unknowingly carry the secret of universal augmentation in his DNA.Police career  As a young man Jensen earned a Bachelor's Degree in Criminal Justice from Phoenix University and Ferris College, according to the framed diplomas in his office. In The Missing Link DLC it is noted that Jensen received an Associates degree in Criminal Justice from the University of Phoenix, Detroit. At the age of 21 he joined the Detroit Police Department. He graduated in the top ten percent of his Police Academy class. In 2018, he joined the Department's SWAT unit and was accepted under the command of Quincy Durant, becoming the leader of Team Two. During this time period Jensen met Sarif Industries scientist Megan Reed, beginning what would become one of the most important relationships of his life. As of Deus Ex: Human Revolution, Jensen had known Megan Reed for ten years. The two began a romantic relationship in 2019, going so far as to consider \"settling down together,\" before splitting in 2023. The separation was amicable and Jensen and Megan remained friends and shared ownership of their dog, Kubrick. In 2020, Jensen and Durant confronted Tyrell Banks, an augmented murderer, who severely injured Durant before being killed by Jensen. Durant was saved by augmentation surgery, something he did not agree with philosophically. In the following years, Jensen witnessed and grew concerned with Durant's increasing aggression and corruption growing with his new powers. Jensen rose quickly through the ranks as part of SWAT Team Two, eventually becoming the commander, but his police career came to an end during an incident known as the Mexicantown Massacre. A young augmented boy was identified as dangerous, and Jensen was given the order to shoot to kill. He refused that order, and it was passed on to another member of Jensen's team, Wayne Haas. It appears that Durant was somehow involved in the incident, as Jensen confronted him just as the riots were calming down. He defeated Durant with an EMP grenade and a bullet in the head, and quit the force soon after. Haas was then promoted into Jensen's vacant slot, though didn't last long under the pressure of guilt concerning the shooting.Sarif Industries  During Jensen and Megan's romantic relationship Megan discovered his unique genetic traits. When Jensen resigned from the police force she advised her employer, David Sarif, to hire Jensen in order to ensure continued access to Jensen's genetic material.  Jensen joined Sarif Industries as Head of Security in 2026. However, the founder of Sarif Industries, David Sarif, being a cautious individual, decided to hire a private investigator named Brent Radford to investigate Jensen's past. Radford discovered Jensen's role in the White Helix experiment and the fate of his biological parents. Sarif chose to not tell Jensen, believing that knowledge of his origins as a human test subject would be harmful to him. Although Sarif was impressed with Jensen's loyalty and skills, Jensen was unwittingly even more important to the company as \"Patient X\" in Reed's research. If Jensen's genetic quirk could be directly integrated into a new generation of biochips, then rejection would be eliminated entirely and augmentation would become as simple as plastic surgery - ushering in a new age of human enhancement and destroying VersaLife's Neuropozyne market. Megan Reed's research was completed in early 2027.Injuries and subsequent augmentation  On the eve of a series of high-profile augmentation hearings in Washington DC, Illuminati member Bob Page responds to Sarif Industries' announcement of a Neuropozyne alternative by ordering the Tyrants, an augmented Black Ops team, to attack the Sarif Industries Headquarters. Megan Reed and four other key researchers are apparently killed in the attack. The Tyrants copy and destroy all data pertaining to the breakthrough, but as they were unaware that Jensen was the source of the announced research breakthrough, they did not realize that he is as important as the five key researchers. However, during the attack, Jensen sustains life-threatening injuries while attempting to repel the attack, culminating in being shot in the head with a .357 Magnum at point-blank range by Tyrants leader Jaron Namir. Although Jensen has sustained fatal injuries, David Sarif takes advantage of Jensen's genetic condition, and a clause in his employment contract, to augment Jensen to an extent which would have been impossible for any other individual. Jensen receives the most advanced augmentations that Sarif Industries could produce. The result is, at that time, probably the single most extensive cybernetic modification that had ever been performed outside the Illuminati's Tyrants. However, the extent of Jensen's injuries meant that most of the augmentations had to be left initially inactive. Jensen is sent home to recuperate, but subsequently struggles to come to terms with his body's fusion with machines - and ends up smashing his bathroom mirror the first time he sees himself in it.Returning to work at Sarif Industries  About six months later, Jensen is taken off sick leave by David Sarif, in order to infiltrate the compromised Sarif manufacturing plant in the Milwaukee Junction, to secure a prototype Typhoon Explosive System augmentation, and to release hostages captured by a pro-human purist organization known as Purity First, led by Zeke Sanders. Making his way through the plant, Jensen locates the Typhoon data - though he also discovers an augmented hacker, with the appearance of a member of Purity First, attempting to steal the data. The hacker urges Jensen to help him, but then immediately commits suicide by shooting himself in the head. Jensen secures the Typhoon data and proceedes through the plant - on Sarif's orders - and confronts Zeke Sanders, who had taken the plant manager Josie Thorpe hostage. Jensen attempts to discern who is behind the attacks on SI, but becomes aware that Sanders and his subordinates are simply pawns, being used by a real mastermind who had been controlling the augmented hacker.Investigation of the attacks  Jensen returns to Sarif Industries HQ in Detroit and undertakes an illegal mission to retrieve the dead hacker's Neural Hub from the Detroit Police Department morgue. Inside the morgue, Jensen discovers that the hacker's Hub had been modified with a wetdrive, and takes the Hub back to his apartment to allow Frank Pritchard to examine it remotely. Pritchard finds out that the modification had turned the hacker into a \"human proxy,\" allowing someone else to hack through him. The hacking attempt had originated in an abandoned factory complex in Highland Park. Pritchard also informs Jensen that a transmitter in Detroit's Derelict Row is maintaining a constant \"backdoor\" into the Sarif Industries network. Jensen goes to Derelict Row and shuts the transmitter down. Faridah Malik airlifts Jensen to the Highland Park warehouse, where Jensen witnesses the arrival of two members of the Tyrants, Lawrence Barrett and Yelena Fedorova, as well as another appearance of their leader, Jaron Namir. Barrett says that their operation was compromised, and that they have failed to retrieve the Neural Hub, despite the fact the Police Station was on lockdown by the orders of Joseph Manderley. Following the Tyrants, Jensen discovers that the warehouse is a front, and that the lower levels housed a FEMA internment camp. Jensen stumbles upon Namir and Fedorova as they are preparing to leave, but is briefly incapacitated by Barrett before he could stop them. Namir orders Barrett to get rid of Jensen, and then departs with Fedorova. Barrett engages Jensen in combat, but loses. Jensen conducts a brief interrogation of the wounded Barrett. Barrett indicates that Sarif Industries is not being targeted by FEMA, but by someone else, and that Jensen should go to Hengsha in order to find out who. Barrett then sets off the grenades strapped to his chest, intending to kill both of them. Jensen stabs him with his combat blade and barely escapes the explosion. He then makes his way back to the surface and Malik takes him back to Sarif Industries to report on the situation. Pritchard tells Jensen about tunnels in the SI network that Sarif had apparently created before Jensen was hired, and that the tunnels had been hidden even from Pritchard. Jensen crosses paths with William Taggart and Isaias Sandoval in the Sarif Industries penthouse, just as they are leaving a meeting with Sarif. Jensen and Sarif discuss Sarif's secret data-stream. Sarif indicates to Jensen - somewhat cryptically - that Megan Reed and her team were not killed because of their involvement in the Typhoon or other military augmentations, but rather because of their research that would redefine human evolution into a self-controlled process. Following the conversation, Jensen is immediately ordered to Hengsha. En-route, Jensen is at the last moment diverted to Juarez to save Sarif's niece from pro-augmentation cartel captors. Her mother is a high-ranking official of the Humanity Front. After the rescue is successful, a terrorist attack against a Humanity Front rally sends Jensen on a hunt for his former SWAT commander Quincy Durant and his pro-augmentation terrorist group. During this ordeal, Jensen befriends and becomes intimately involved with Katrina Sutherland, who sacrifices herself to save him, just as he was about to take his own life in a hopeless attempt to save her from Durant. Her death deeply affects Jensen, who then continues his original mission, heading for Hengsha. In Hengsha, Jensen is directed by Malik to the Youzhao district, the location of the Hengsha Court Gardens apartments. However, the building is under lockdown by Belltower Associates, a privately-contracted security force operating through Hengsha. Jensen gets through the lockdown and finds the apartment from which the real hacker, Arie van Bruggen, was operating. Van Bruggen is not there, having gone on the run. Malik suggests that Jensen speak with Tong Si Hung, owner of The Hive nightclub, as he may have information on the hacker's whereabouts. After some negotiation, Jensen speaks privately with Tong, who tells him that van Bruggen is hiding in the Alice Garden Pods motel. Jensen tracks down van Bruggen at the motel, but he insists that he was simply a middleman, hired by Zhao Yun Ru to lay the groundwork for a hostile takeover of Sarif Industries by Zhao's own corporation, Tai Yong Medical. Van Bruggen also says that he has stashed evidence of this in the TYM tower in Upper Hengsha. He encodes a TYM employee card with Jensen's biometrics in order to allow Jensen to access the tower. However, Jensen's conversation with van Bruggen is cut short by the arrival of a large number of Belltower soldiers led by Narhari Kahn. The soldiers have been tasked with killing van Bruggen. The hacker pleads with Jensen to give him a weapon, and opts to attempt to escape the attack on his own. Jensen escapes from the building and takes a TYM shuttle up into the Pangu, the artificial structure between Lower and Upper Hengsha. Jensen makes his way up through the Pangu and into the Tai Yong Medical tower, where he finds van Bruggen's recording from six months earlier - which shows Zhao speaking with Namir in advance of the attack on Sarif Industries. The recording reveals that Megan Reed and her team were not killed by the Tyrants, but merely kidnapped and taken to an unknown location, and that Picus TV newsreader Eliza Cassan was involved.Search for kidnapped SI scientists  Jensen informs David Sarif of what he had discovered and heads to Zhao's office to get answers about the kidnapping. Zhao briefly plays the victim, telling him that she had no choice in her actions - but as soon as Jensen lets his guard down, she locks herself in a panic room and triggers an alarm, forcing Jensen to flee to the tower's helipad. From there, Malik flies Jensen to Montreal, to confront Eliza Cassan. Jensen finds the Picus TV building to be entirely devoid of people, having been evacuated and sealed by fire alarm protocols. Pritchard confirms that the alarms had been silenced after the lockdown. Jensen makes his way to Room 404 and has a brief conversation with Eliza. Eliza says that she had been observing Jensen since an occasion six months ago on which she had been ordered to temporarily disrupt satellites over Detroit - an action that effectively jammed the G-P-L implants in the kidnapped Sarif Industries scientists, creating the appearance that the scientists were dead. Jensen attempts to take Eliza away with him, but discovered that he had been speaking to a holographic projection. A large number of Belltower soldiers begin searching the building for Jensen. During Jensen's escape through the Picus offices, he is contacted by Pritchard, who says that the projection of the hologram was accompanied by a massive power spike originating from a sub-basement connected to the main building by a funicular elevator. Jensen descends to the sub-basement, where he finds an entire suite of offices dedicated to altering, censoring, and manipulating information on a global scale. In room 802-11, he discovers that Eliza Cassan herself is actually a massive, sophisticated computer intelligence, programmed to monitor communications and data streams worldwide. Eliza's purpose is to find out what people were talking about and - if necessary - reshape the message in line with the designs of a powerful faction that she was physically unable to name. Following Eliza's conversation with Jensen, the Tyrant Fedorova appears and engages Jensen in combat, but is defeated. After Fedorova's defeat, Eliza presents Jensen with a recording that show Sandoval and Namir discussing the removal of the G-P-L implants from the Sarif Industries scientists. Jensen deduces that the scientists would have been taken to the FEMA internment camp after the kidnapping, as the facility had the operating suite that would be required for such surgery. Eliza states that Sarif would know why the scientists were kidnapped in the first place, but warned Jensen that everybody lies. Malik - responding to a signal from Eliza - picks up Jensen from a nearby Picus helipad and flies him back to Detroit. Following Picus TV's release of footage that showed biotechnology companies engaged in augmented supersoldier experiments, Detroit - like many other major cities around the world - is the scene of extensive anti-augmentation riots. Sarif comes to Jensen's apartment at the Chiron Building, where Jensen confronts him about the reason for the kidnappings. Sarif makes vague allusions to the power of the unnamed group behind it all - and Jensen (somewhat incredulously) describes them as the Illuminati. Sarif says that Megan Reed was on the verge of a historic breakthrough - one that would have made augmentations safe and available for everyone. Jensen mentions Sandoval's involvement, and Sarif provides an invitation to Taggart's speech at the Detroit Convention Center - but urges caution and delicacy, as Taggart's motives are questionable. At the Convention Center, Jensen discovers that Sandoval is not attending the speech, and proceeds to Sandoval's apartment. There, Jensen discovers a hidden passage into the sewers, and confronts Sandoval in a secret room guarded by members of Purity First. Following Taggart's speech, which shifted all the blame on to him, Sandoval becomes suicidal. Jensen nevertheless learned that Sandoval's involvement with the kidnapping had ended after he failed to remove the kidnapped scientists' G-P-Ls. He was only able to change the G-P-L frequencies to one so low that nobody would think to look for it. Pritchard tells Jensen to return to Sarif Industries and report, and that he will look into tracking the adjusted frequencies. At Sarif's office, Jensen is met not by Sarif but by Hugh Darrow, the creator of mechanical augmentations. Darrow says that Sarif has urged him to invite delegates from the United Nations to Panchaea and to persuade them that regulation of the augmentation industry is unnecessary. Following this conversation, Sarif appears and tells Jensen privately that Pritchard has tracked Vasili Sevchenko's G-P-L to Hengsha. Sarif indicates that he has called in a favor from the Defense Department in order to do this, meaning that the conspirators would expect Jensen's arrival. On the approach to Hengsha, Malik's VTOL is diverted by flight control, and subsequently disables by an EMP missile fired by a Belltower operative. Malik makes an emergency landing in a suburban area near the Alice Garden Pods. Escaping from the ensuing Belltower ambush, Jensen takes an elevator to street level, where he suddenly experiences a painful glitch in his augmentations. Everyone else with augmentation is similarly affected at the same moment. The World Health Organization announces a problem with a faulty biochip, and issues a mass recall, advising every augmented person worldwide to visit their nearest LIMB clinic for a replacement. Jensen followes Sevchenko's G-P-L signal to the Harvester hideout in Youzhao district. Inside, he once again meets Tong, who is wearing Sevchenko's scavenged cybernetic arm. Sevchenko himself was already dead; his corpse had been given to the Harvesters by Belltower a few weeks earlier. Tong claims that he didn't know about the other four Sarif employees - but would now tell Jensen more, if Jensen agrees to rescue Tong's son, who had been captured by Belltower. Jensen accomplishes the rescue, but learnes from Tong Jr. that the capture had been deliberately orchestrated. Tong Jr. wanted to leave Hengsha because he did not share his father's love of augmentations, and he felt that his family shouldn't put so much trust in the technology. Tong Jr. then departes with the aid of a personal cloaking device. In exchange for the rescue, Tong Sr. tells Jensen to look for clues at the Belltower dock, where several ships seemed to be loaded at night and dispatched to unknown destination. At the dock, Jensen is told by Tong to pick up a parcel containing a bomb, and detonate it in the shipping company's offices. The bomb turnes out to have been set with an extremely short countdown, presumably with the intention that Jensen himself would die. Jensen escapes the blast by jumping out of a window, and, in the resulting chaos, sneaks into a shipping crate and conceal himself in an empty cryo-pod, while Tong's son sneaks aboard a ship for Hong Kong.Rifleman Bank Station episode  Jensen is found hiding aboard Hei Zhen Zhu and takes out multiple Belltower troopers before he is subdued, put into an EMP chair, and brutally interrogated by Pieter Burke and Netanya Keitner. Unexpectedly, the chair is deactivated, allowing Jensen to escape. Jensen is soon contacted by a mysterious hacker, advising him to get out of the ship and meet with a contact, which turns out to be Netanya Keitner, on Rifleman Bank Station. Keitner had assisted in Jensen's escape as it seemed to her the best chance to get someone to find proof that Belltower is associated with something illegal. Eventually, with assistance of Keitner and a Belltower engineer Garvin Quinn, Jensen accesses the seafloor laboratories from the prison wing to findout that the prisoners are turned into parts of Organic Computational Matrix computers. Jensen urges Tiffany Kavanagh her to get the incriminating evidence on Belltower and to escape with it after he orders a submersible. As Jensen gets back to the station, his elevator is stuck halfway through. Keitner informs him that Burke has found out what they have been doing, before Jensen climbs his way to the top. He finds Keitner fatally wounded, who got the submersible for Kavanagh before Burke locked down the station and started to fill the prisons and the laboratory with toxic gas, which will kill the prisoners and Kavanagh unless Jensen does something about it. The lockdown is eventually lifted and Jensen takes out Burke and the team guarding him. The mystery hacker then contacts Jensen to inform him that the way is clear for him to get back to the ship, that could take him to Reed. Quinn reveals himself to be the hacker and tells it will be only a matter of time before the black station makes to the international headlines. He also gets Jensen a helicopter to take him to the ship inside a cryo-pod as the ship already managed to leave.Back on track  Several days later, Jensen awakens and emerges from the cryo-pod in an unknown location. Upon re-establishing contact with Pritchard, Jensen discovers that he is now at the Omega Ranch biotech lab facility in Singapore. On Pritchard's instructions, Jensen disables a nearby signal-jammer, allowing location of the G-P-Ls of the remaining scientists. Jensen speaks to each scientist inside the ranch facility and recruits them into an escape plan that entails infecting the ranch's computers with a virus that Sevchenko created before his death, and then staging three simultaneous serious incidents in the laboratories themselves. The virus would prevent the scientists' G-P-L signals from being tracked while they escape. Jensen proceeds to the secure wing of the facility to locate Megan Reed, but crosses paths with Zhao and Namir once again. He confronts Zhao about the biochip upgrades being another plot by the Illuminati - a killswitch intended to limit the abilities of augmented people so that they could easily be controlled. Zhao tried to use the killswitch to incapacitate Jensen, but Jensen is nevertheless able to defeat Namir in combat. Zhao escapes. Jensen discovers Megan Reed, alive, in a secure suite nearby. Reed says that Darrow knew what the Illuminati were planning, and had tasked her with making modifications to the biochip before mass production began, which would prevent the chips being used as a killswitch. Immediately after this conversation, however, a broadcast from Panchaea revealed Darrow's true intention - he had altered the killswitch signal to enable him to project terrible hallucinations into the minds of augmented people. He activates the signal, driving all augmented people throughout the world to violent insanity. This event would later become known as the \"Aug Incident.\"Role in the Aug Incident  Reed urges Jensen to try to shut down the signal. Jensen agrees. The four scientists escape in a VTOL while Jensen takes Darrow's sub-orbital shuttle to Panchaea. Most people at Panchaea had either been driven insane by the signal or been killed by those who had been. Jensen makes his way to the control room and confronts Darrow. Darrow insists that humanity has taken his gift of augmentation technology and twisted it, and altered the biochip signal as a way of showing that the technology is dangerous and that mankind needs to evolve without it. Darrow urges Jensen to allow his message to the world to expose the Illuminati and everything that had happened. After hearing Darrow's arguments, Jensen descends to the lowest levels of the facility to shut down the signal driving the augs insane. At the very bottom of the facility, Jensen finds the Hyron Core, a quantum computer that used human drones as living processors. Zhao appears and connects herself to the Hyron system, intent on altering Darrow's signal for the Illuminati's benefit. However, the system rejects her biochip. In an attempt to gain control, Zhao activates the core's defenses, turning them on Jensen. Jensen is forced to destroy the human drones and kill Zhao. With Zhao gone, Jensen accesses the broadcast control room. Here, Jensen is contacted by Eliza Cassan, who gives him the option of sending Darrow's recorded confession, warning the public of the potential danger of transhuman augmentations; the option of editing the message according to Sarif's suggestion, so as to blame the Humanity Front for their collaboration in producing the biochip and denounce the anti-augmentation movement to the public; editing it according to Taggart's suggestion, so as to blame the chaos on contaminated Neuropozyne from VersaLife, erasing any information about the Illuminati, and urging the public to demand regulation on augmentation research; and the option of destroying Panchaea by turning off its water pressure control system, killing everyone on the base and destroying all information and leaving the public unaware of any truth. Due to the damage sustained as a result of the Aug Incident, Panchaea is destroyed. Jensen is is plunged into the Arctic Ocean, with only his Sentinel RX Health System to keep him alive.After the Aug Incident  Jensen's body is recovered from the wreckage of Panchaea by an Illuminati-controlled recovery team, and is secretly sent to a facility in the Baltic Sea. However, the events that transpired there are unclear. Sometime after the Aug Incident, a full set of cutting-edge experimental augmentations were installed in Jensen by Vadim Orlov. It is further suggested this his memories were altered in some way by the Illuminati.Awakening in Alaska and return to Detroit  In late 2028, one year after the Aug Incident, Jensen awakens from a coma to find himself in Facility 451 in Alaska, a processing clinic for augmented people set up by the World Health Organization. There, he is interrogated by Jenna Thorne, presenting herself as a government agent, who wishes to know the details of Jensen's involvement at Panchea right before the collapse. Suspecting that Thorne is an Illuminati agent, Jensen refuses to divulge any details. With the help of Stacks, Jensen escapes the facility. He then contacts Pritchard, who helps Jensen and Stacks return to Detroit. By early 2029, Detroit has now become much more discriminatory towards augs due to the Aug Incident, with \"naturals only\" signs being posted on train carriages and at the Chiron Building, the building of Jensen's former apartment. Together with Pritchard and Stacks, Jensen visits the Sarif Industries' former headquarters, now abandoned after Sarif was bought out by Tai Yong Medical. Jensen and Stacks then investigate Sarif Industry's now-abandoned Milwaukee Junction manufacturing plant. There, they discover that the Motor City Bangers are looting military-grade augmentations from the plant. Jensen and Stacks manage to destroy the Junction to prevent further looting, although a sizable amount of military-grade augmentations have already been looted. It is later revealed that the Illuminati intend to use the augmentations for operations in Europe. In order to extract the augmentations out of Detroit, an operation assigned to Thorne, the Illuminati plan to have the arms dealer Sheppard air-lift the augmentations out of the city by a cargo jet. Jensen is captured by Don Wilder, an ex-Sarif employee now working as a local proxy for Thorne. Wilders intends to kill Jensen, but is denied permission to do so by Thorne, who instructs Wilders to leave Jensen for pick-up by local police. Meanwhile, a unit from the North American Division of Interpol's Task Force 29 is in Detroit to track down Sheppard's illegal weapons trafficking. TF29 manages to reach Jensen before the local police. Jensen returns the favor by helping TF29 stop Sheppard from air-lifting the augmentations out of the city. The TF29 commander, Christian Jarreau, is impressed with how Jensen handled himself and offers him a position in his force, but Jensen is not yet ready to commit. In Detroit, Jensen is also approached by Juggernaut Collective members Garvin Quinn and Alex Vega, who want to recruit Jensen. The Juggernaut Collective assists Jensen in locating a train, carrying the augmentations seized from Sheppard by TF29, that is about to be attacked by an Illuminati strike force tasked with seizing the augmentations for themselves. Alex flies Jensen to the train. Meanwhile, the train guarded by TF29 is rapidly being seized by the Illuminati strike force, which includes Gunther Hermann and others under the command of Jenna Thorne. Jensen arrives and assists TF29 agent Raye Vande, one of the few survivors, fight against the Illuminati operatives. Vande is killed by Thorne, but Jensen is successful in causing the train to run off the track, forcing Hermann to flee. Jensen then confronts Thorne, who is irate at the fact that her superiors seem to want to keep Jensen alive for reasons unknown to her. Earlier, Thorne was reminded by Hermann that she would be exceeding her authority if she were to kill Jensen herself. Nonetheless, feeling defiant of her superiors, Thorne attempts to kill Jensen but is defeated. Jensen then escapes the train before it derails and crashes. Jarreau then arrives. Jensen, who had just witnessed the deaths of TF29 members on the train, would later take up on Jarreau's offer of recruiting Jensen into TF29. Jensen also decides to join the Collective, telling Quinn and Alex that he has had enough of how the Illuminati has caused the deaths of so many innocent lives, including those of Keitner and Sevchenko. Juggernaut leader Janus has determined that TF29 has been compromised by the Illuminati and that Eastern Europe is the heart of the Illuminati's infiltration of the task force. Janus wants to deploy Jensen to TF29's Central European Division based in Prague to investigate Illuminati activity there, as well as the local TF29 director, Jim Miller.First mission for TF29 and subsequent transfer to Prague  Jensen begins work for TF29 in its North American Division. In Jensen's first mission for TF29, he is sent to an aug-only super-max prison known as the \"Pent House\" to make contact with Hector Guerrero, a deep-undercover Interpol agent who has gone dark. Jensen does not stay with the North American Division for long. Shortly afterwards, Jensen is transferred to the Prague-based Central European Division. Jensen's arrival in Prague thus fulfills Janus' objective of deploying Jensen to Prague. However, it is later revealed in Mankind Divided that Joseph Manderley, the director of TF29 and an Illuminati member, signed Jensen into TF29's Prague-based division, indicating that the Illuminati purposely allowed him to join.Early missions in Prague  Shortly after Jensen joins TF29's Prague-based Central European Division, the team is sent to rescue kidnapped children but the team leader, Duncan MacReady, leaves Jensen at the VTOL while the rest storm the building. Hearing that the fight is getting bad, Jensen rushes in, ignoring Miller's orders to stay, and saves the team from the augmented terrorists. However, one of them gets away before Jensen can pursue while the rest of the team finds the children and start to evacuate them. Jensen runs back up to the roof to find the escaped aug, only to see him escape down an alley. Jensen starts to pursue, but Miller tells him to stand down. However, Titus King, a Picus News reporter with anti-aug sentiments, corners Jensen and Miller orders Jensen to only say \"no comment\" unless he wants to be kicked off the team. Agent Jana Niemi gets Jensen back inside the warehouse before they and MacReady find a suspiciously locked door and find a natural woman, Helena, and an augmented boy, Marek, handcuffed inside. Another terrorist appears and Jensen follows him to the warehouse floor, where another agent knocks him out. Helena reveals the terrorist's name is Bruno before MacReady asks why she is there. She explains she is being forced to look after the children as her own daughter, Emilia, is being held hostage in Glassh\u00fctte, an aug ghetto in Dresden. Bruno comes around and draws their attention to Marek before MacReady punches Bruno, only for the terrorist to repeat an obvious kill phrase that makes Marek turn red before the warehouse explodes, killing Marek, Bruno, and Niemi. The team sends samples from the warehouse back to their HQ for Smiley to look over while Miller hands Helena off to Prague's police. Jensen tries to say they need to get Emilia, but Miller refuses until Chang informs them one of the samples matches a breakout from Glassh\u00fctte and Jensen confirms the pictures are of the escaped aug, sending the team to Dresden. Jensen is sent in alone into Glassh\u00fctte and finds the escaped aug, Sebastian, with a stockpile of weapons. Another aug informs Sebastian that a mole inside the local police knows Interpol is coming but Jensen attacks before they can move. However, Sebastian orders another to kill the girl, so Jensen knocks him out and chases after the messenger. With Alex Vega's help, he finds the room and kills the guards and rescues Emilia. Sebastian escaped, so the team returns to Prague with Emilia and discuss what happened before Miller tasks Jensen with talking to the girl to try and get more information. However, the girl, seeing King's latest anti-aug broadcast, is upset and starts to become angry and Alex calls Jensen to let him know someone within TF29 knew Marek was going to blow himself up. Miller then informs Jensen he just got orders that the girl and her mother are to be taken to a safehouse. Smiley interrupts to give Jensen important information: one of the samples he ran came back as being related to Titus King. Miler then tells Jensen the car is ready, with the route already programmed into it. Jensen retrieves mother and daughter and starts to drive them to the safehouse when someone shoots Helena in the head and an explosion goes off on the car, throwing Jensen out of the vehicle and knocking him out. A vehicle pulls up, retrieves an unconscious Emilia, and leaves. As TF29 check out the crash scene, Jensen comments that the bomb on the car was just big enough to get him out of the way but keep Emilia alive, and asks how it got on one of their vehicles, to which Miller points out it was not theirs but one from Interpol itself before sending Jensen home for rest. However, Alex tells Jensen there is a link between the Illuminati and Titus King, so he decides to check out the reporter's studio while the reporter is still outside Glassh\u00fctte's walls, broadcasting his hate-mongering alongside Pavel Mikulski, an anti-aug politician. Unknown to them, Sebastian leads a group of children soldiers through the ghetto and gives them weapons before placing a bomb. Jensen, meanwhile, finds King's servers and learns that Sebastian is Titus King's son and was augmented to save his life, but during the Aug Incident, he accidentally killed his mother. An explosion goes off on Glassh\u00fctte's border and terrorists pour out, grab and knock out Titus King, and drag him into the ghetto. TF29 goes mobile and Miller tells Jensen to join them, so he gets a ride from Alex. En route, he learns that Emilia is among the children soldiers, shooting at the police. In Dresden, the Collective tell Jensen of Sebastian's real plan: to reveal he is King's son before blowing them both up on a live broadcast, but they have a non-violent way to end it. Jensen convinces Miller to let him go in solo, and the Collective block all of Sebastian's feeds, ending the broadcast after he reveals the family ties. Not deterred, Sebastian hugs on his father, making hints that he is about to set off the bombs when an unknown person gives a command to another agent, Vasquez, to take the shot if he has it, and he does. Afterwards, Miller tells Jensen that Sebastian was too high of a risk to let live and keeping him in the dark was necessary, but Jensen inwardly thinks how they still do not know where the weapons and bombs came from. He is then approached by Emilia, who is angry at him for saving Titus King before she is taken away with the other aug children. Miller privately approaches Vasquez to ask who gave him the order, but the latter confusingly responds he thought it was Miller. King, meanwhile, gets back to his studio to play up on the events, using it as an excuse as to why no one should be augmented and that in wars, sons will die. Elsewhere, Mikulski attends an Illuminati meeting, who say they supplied enough weapons to Sebastian to light the fuse and now they just need to control the timing of the explosion. They then discuss whether to announce their initiative, which they have named the Human Restoration Act.Mission in Dubai and the R\u016f\u017ei\u010dka Station bombing  In October or November of 2029, now six months since Jensen first joined TF29, Jensen's team is suddenly given a last minute assignment in Dubai to break up an illegal arms deal between Sheppard and the Jinn. All appears to be going according to plan, until a group of gold-masked mercenaries ambush the weapons deal, killing Shepard and all of the Jinn members present except for undercover Interpol agent Arun Singh. Once back in Prague, Jensen meets Alex Vega at R\u016f\u017ei\u010dka Station. Jensen and to Alex suspect that Jensen's team was sent to Dubai intentionally by the Illuminati in order to officially \"witness\" something. Moments later, bombs go off, blowing up the station in an apparent terrorist attack. In the aftermath of the explosions, a child is screaming for his mom to be saved from under the rubble and wreckage. Adam hears this, and intervenes, but it's too late; she dies shortly after touching Adam's hand, which is the moment he remembers why he's doing what he's doing, and the eye shields come on, the banter with side character stops, and he becomes much colder as a character. Mail at TF29 HQ confirms this, as well as the identity of the woman killed, whom Adam tried to save.Searching for clues  Back at TF29, Jensen is assigned to investigate the R\u016f\u017ei\u010dka Station bombing by collecting evidence from the station. However, Jensen is also conducting a parallel investigation with the Collective to uncover the true reason behind the bombing and the Dubai ambush. He learns that the Augmented Rights Coalition are being framed for a number of attacks, including the ones in Dubai and R\u016f\u017ei\u010dka Station. Jim Miller sends Jensen into Golem City to retrieve ARC's leader, Talos Rucker, but Rucker dies while talking to Jensen, forcing him to return home empty-handed (depending on how you behaved in Golem, this could have dire consequences for your playthrough). Back in Prague, Jensen learns from Smiley that the evidence he collected from R\u016f\u017ei\u010dka Station links to a locally made wristwatch by Nomad Stan\u011bk. Jensen learns Nomad's daughter, Allison Stan\u011bk, is most likely the bomb-maker. Taking advantage of Miller's absence, Jensen enters Miller's Neural SubNet machine to examine, on behalf of the Juggernaut Collective, evidence of Miller's potential involvement with the Illuminati. Looking through the recorded conversations, Jensen learns that Miller was being ordered by Joseph Manderley to put blame on ARC for the Dubai ambush and the R\u016f\u017ei\u010dka Station bombing. The recording also shows that Manderley's actions are being controlled by another man, who had instructed Manderley to order the assassination of Talos Rucker using something known as the \"Orchid.\" Jensen then teleconferences with Janus, who tells Jensen that Manderley's superior is Bob Page, owner of VersaLife. Janus suggests that Jensen infiltrate the VersaLife vault in the Palisade Property Bank to learn more about the Orchid. However, Jensen also receives a call from Nomad Stan\u011bk to rescue Allison Stan\u011bk. Following the clues, Jensen learns that he needs to investigate a facility in the Swiss Alps known as G.A.R.M. Sometime prior to leaving for G.A.R.M., Jensen is contacted by Francis Pritchard, who asks Jensen to help him obtain data stored on the Palisade Blades on behalf of David Sarif, whom Pritchard refers to as his client. With the help of the hacker ShadowChild, Jensen infiltrates Palisade Blade-01, and succeeds in getting the data sought by Pritchard. Jensen's infiltration of the Blade results in the creation of the Breach. When Jensen goes to G.A.R.M., he is immediately ambushed by Viktor Marchenko, whom Jensen met earlier in Golem City. Marchenko attempts to kill Jensen with the Orchid, the same substance used to assassinate Talos Rucker. In its current state, the Orchid is lethal. However, due to the way the Orchid works and Adam's unique DNA, Jensen survives. During Jensen's visit to G.A.R.M., he learns that another attack is being planned. Back in Prague, Jensen discovers that the impending attack is set to take place at the Apex Centre, London during a conference set up by Nathaniel Brown of the Santeau Group. In Jensen's apartment, Vega tells Jensen that Brown is working to oppose the passage of Human Restoration Act. If the Act passes, Brown's corporation, the Santeau Group, will be unable to sustain the inflow of the augmented into their safe-haven cities such as Rabi'ah, which would result in enormous financial loss. Vega tells Jensen that the Illuminati's plan is to stop Brown.Stopping the attack in London  Prague's TF29 Division travels to London to attempt to prevent the attack. Jensen is presented with the decision of whether to focus on stopping Viktor Marchenko from detonating bombs in a nearby residential building, or prevent Nathaniel Brown and his delegates from being poisoned by the Orchid. After the London mission, Jensen and the Juggernaut Collective are now a step closer to bringing down the Illuminati. He has the names of two conspirators involved in organizing the attacks and framing ARC, Bob Page and Joseph Manderley, and he plans to bring them to justice. Adam is also interested in uncovering the identity of Janus, who refuses to meet other members in person. Jensen makes clear that he wants to meet Janus face-to-face.Personality  The personality that Jensen exhibits during Deus Ex: Human Revolution is fixed in many ways, but the player has the ability to shape it in various others. The game provides continuous opportunities for the player to decide Jensen's ethical/moral stance towards social behavior and the use of violence. The player can also shape Jensen's evaluation of his own role in events that have already taken place by the time the story begins - such as the Mexicantown Massacre. Jensen is described as a \"working class hero\" and exhibits personality traits consistent with that mentality: dependable, resourceful, curious (in a stand-offish way), and with a streak of cynicism. Jensen's childhood and experiences with his mother Margie may have impacted his life and career decisions in that it may have inclined him to a life of service and a desire to help others. The most prominent fixed element of Jensen's personality is that he is a loner, though he was allegedly getting better before the train attack. He undertakes missions exclusively alone and rarely displays strong emotion even towards close acquaintances. He's also stoic and maybe even a bit melancholic when expressing himself, rarely showing any emotion, be it happiness, joy, sadness or anger when speaking to others. However, a few people in Jensen's life do provoke him to more emotional reactions and his inner thoughts and monologues are highly emotional, but he keeps those emotions to himself. He retains strong affection for his ex-girlfriend Megan Reed and he nearly commits suicide in an attempt to save his new friend and lover, Katrina Sutherland. Although he has a general distrust of authority - perhaps as a consequence of his experiences in law enforcement - Jensen respects and trusts his employer, David Sarif, and reacts badly when that trust is not reciprocated. He shows antipathy toward his colleague Frank Pritchard, who regards him with disdain in return, although their dislike of each other appears to be fairly superficial. Jensen's bitterness toward Sarif carries over into Deus Ex: Mankind Divided as early on, when Sarif leaves a message on Adam's answering machine, one can simply leave the apartment and not answer. If you come back later to discuss the experimental augs, Adam doesn't retract his eye shields and has quite a few unflattering things to say to Sarif. By Jensen's own admission he becomes \"bore-sighted\" on goals, focusing on a target to the exclusion of everything else. Jensen considers this \"not one of my better qualities.\" When first facing Zhao Yun Ru, Jensen hesitates and is easily distracted when Zhao pretends to be a victim. It slightly suggests something about Adam's personality, possibly that he has a soft spot for women in distress, although the reaction could have easily been manipulated by a CASIE augmentation. Many of the fixed events in the game, and especially in the comic series, describe Jensen as a professional operative with a high regard for innocent civilians in danger, but he's not above collateral damage if it'll stop further bloodshed. Furthermore, Adam is both a smoker and a drinker. Adam, before he is augmented, is able to cope with a lot of things, as he takes his separation from Megan Reed in stride. Thus, we see little evidence to provoke his indulgence in vices. However, after the attack, he loses everything that matters to him: his humanity, his lover, and his dog, among other things. The result of this pushed Adam into a depression (he smashed his fist into his mirror), driving him to smoke and drink. We can draw from this that, regardless of the choices the player makes in the game to indicate otherwise, Adam Jensen is often given choices to perform actions that tend to his soul. Gameplay in Deus Ex: Human Revolution does not usually force the player to commit to a particular personality, or at least not completely. The player has freedom to be inconsistent. It is possible for the player's actions to result in the implication that Jensen is extremely manipulative, to the point of being sociopathic. Practical consequences from the game world and story are mostly determined by what happens, rather than by an assessment of why the player did it, so Jensen's motivations are largely open to the player's interpretation.Augmentations  Alongside Jaron Namir, Adam Jensen is likely the most augmented character in Deus Ex: Human Revolution, with forty to fifty percent of his body replaced with augmentation. All of his initial augmentations were produced by Sarif Industries, and were given to him as a result of the attack by the Tyrants. While Namir seems to have his head and spine implanted into a robotic body, Jensen's augmentations are grafted into his organic torso and skin. All of Adam Jensen's limbs have been completely replaced: his arms include nanoceramic blades that can be released at either the wrists or elbows for close quarters combat, a function that enables him to punch through walls by opening a section of his forearm, and the ability to dislocate his fingers (which he uses when grabbing a guard's helmet and spinning him in midair, causing massive spinal trauma). Other augmentations include firing stability, lifting heavy weight, and firing accuracy while running. Jensen's legs are not visible as he wears pants and combat boots to cover them; however, they have various abilities, with no working parts shown to move. It is revealed in the comic that his legs are mechanical from just above the knee down. Deus Ex: Mankind Divided corroborates this early in the game when Jensen is first seen in his apartment, sporting Sarif manufactured legs. If the player interacts with the shower they can see the extent of Jensen's augmentation. His torso appears to be biological, but is covered in dermal armor, along with bolt ports from the bar placed within his chest to support said augments. Underneath he has a variety of cardiovascular and muscular augmentations, such as an internal rebreather, a Sentinel RX health system, three types of bio-electric batteries, and the Typhoon Explosive System, its ejection ports mounted on his upper and lower arms. Jensen has two augmentations attached to his spinal column: a Reflex Booster and the Icarus Landing System (although the effects of the landing system appear to originate from anywhere in his body). Jensen uses the Glass-Shield cloaking system, which classes as a skin augmentation. The origin of the mechanism is still indeterminate. Jensen's head has a plethora of augmentations, most notably a variety of hacking tools and the CASIE module (allowing him to see personality traits and emotional reactions of those he converses with). Jensen bears a hexagonal scar on the left side of his forehead, the result of the insertion of the Infolink's implant module containing a neural hub server, which is paired with a communications bead bonded to his mastoid bone, allowing for subvocal communication. He also has a cochlear implant within his ear cavity. Jensen's eyes have notably been replaced with cybernetic eyes (Eye-know Sarif brand) with gold irises that display various information about the environment, and can be used to record and view video, as well as serve as the base layer for some rather uncommon augs, like Smart Vision and its MAGPIE upgrade, Flash Suppressant upgrade, and a complete suite of Wayfinder Radar System modules. Jensen's eyes are compatible with another Sarif Industries cybernetic eye, the \"Atid\" model. Additionally he has an unspecified implant that allows him to cover his eyes in eye-shield lenses hidden in black comma-shaped augments around his eyes, an augmentation he shares with Ben Saxon. NPCs occasionally refer to this augment as \"mirrorshades.\" Jensen almost always keeps the lenses activated, appearing to only retract them when sleeping, showering, or engaging in important conversations or interaction. Adam is the only known Neuropozyne-independent augmentee, the result of experiments performed upon him as an infant at White Helix Labs. However his augmentations post-surgery are for the most part immediately \"locked\" to prevent overexertion of the brain during his recovery. Over time (or with the use of Praxis kits), Jensen learns to use his augmentations effectively, one at a time. By the time of Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, he's the most advanced aug in operation, and possess orange level clearance (do what he says, question his motives at your own peril), and his classification is B-H-8-4-7. This marks him out as a walking weapon of the most extreme class, with the most cutting edge augs, abilities, and growth factor (first digit), he has overall respect for authority and the law, to a point (second digit), and a license to carry, employ, and possess weapons of mass destruction (third digit). Not only does he have his Interpol papers, his orange level ID card, and his ogre classification, but he's also been granted a weaponized augmentation license, which allows him legal use of a, as one metro station cop puts it, \"reusable suicide vest.\" Sometimes panic-stricken civilians will cry \"There's an ogre after me!,\" which is more than fitting, because after the standardization Jensen legally became an ogre: an aug built for combat and subterfuge. In the future, after killing at least a thousand men, Gunther Hermann would also earn this by then old-fashioned nickname. Only a handful of characters in the game know the full ramifications of Adam's papers and licenses, and all but one (a train checkpoint guard on the second day) respond with outright terror. The one who knows what it means has a lot to say in the few words he gets).Notes & Trivia Praxis Kit  Praxis Kits are consumable items in multiple games in the Deus Ex series, including Deus Ex: Human Revolution, Deus Ex: The Fall and Deus Ex: Mankind Divided. Praxis Kits are used to unlock augmentations for the player character.Overview  In the games in which they appear, Praxis Kits offer \"Praxis Points,\" which are used to unlock augmentations. Praxis Points can alternatively be earned by in-game experience (also called \"Praxis\"). For game-specific information, please see the following gameplay articles:Background  After someone receives mechanical augmentations, it is common for many of the new features to be \"locked\" so that the body does not get overwhelmed and reject the augmentations. Traditionally, these abilities \"unlock\" themselves through prolonged usage of the augmentations, thus allowing the body to become accustomed to the new features slowly. Praxis Kits, which contain Praxis software, allow this process to be bypassed manually so as to release new features as the user wishes. This method is usually not an option for most augmentation users, but on rare occasions when a user's body accepts the augmentations with greater ease, Praxis Kits can be used to advance the process without the need for prolonged use of the augmentation. Praxis Kits are generally considered expensive, making them difficult to obtain for most augmented users. The Tyrants offer Praxis software to their members, something that the Tyrants leader Jaron Namir call a luxury only offered to the finest mercenary agents. In 2027, Praxis Kits are distributed mainly by LIMB clinics.David Sarif uses his influence, through generous donations, to give Adam Jensen preferred customer status. As such, Jensen can purchase Praxis Kits at LIMB clinics if he so chooses. Vera Marcovic, a doctor in Detroit's clinic stresses however, that this must be done on Adam's own free will, not Sarif's or anyone else's.Weapons (DXHR)  This page lists all weapons in Deus Ex: Human Revolution.Handguns Rifles Heavy Explosives Weapon modifications (DXHR)  In Deus Ex: Human Revolution, several different weapon modifications are available. Each one either improves one of the weapon's attributes or adds an extra feature to the weapon. Not all modifications are compatible with every weapon.Weapon/modification combinations  Aside from \"Ammo Rounds\", \"Special upgrade\" and \"#\" each column refers to a general upgrade. Numbers in these cells mean base / max upgrade possible. Slash hyphen, \"/ -\", means no upgrade possible. The last column, #, shows total number of upgrades the weapon can get. Example: \"2 / 5\" means a base value of 2 with a maximum of 5, hence 3 upgrades can be added. Note: Laser modification is known to cause less accuracy (you need to aim higher than where the dot shows to hit) when in zoom/alt mode on both sniper rifles. May apply to other weapons too.Locations (by mod) Ammo Capacity Upgrade  Description: Increases ammo capacity of given weapon, upgrade depends on weapon: Revolver and Sniper Rifle +1, Pistol +3, Shotgun +2, Combat Rifle and Machine Pistol +10, Heavy Rifle +25, Laser rifle +100. Available locations:Armor Piercing System  Description: Negates enemies' armor bonuses effectively doing more damage. Exclusive upgrade for the 10mm pistol. Available locations:Burst Round System  Description: Fires two cartridges per shot, doubling the damage. Only for shotgun. Available locations:Cooling System  Description: Prevents rapid overheating of weapon during constant fire. Available for plasma and heavy rifles. NOTE: In the PC version, the overheating bug for the plasma rifle has been fixed, making this upgrade necessary for it. Available locations:Damage Upgrade  Description: Increases weapon damage. Available locations:Explosive Rounds  Description: Allows the revolver to fire explosive rounds, increasing damage and adding splash. Available locations:Heat Targeting System  Description: Allows the rocket launcher missiles to home onto targets via heat-seeking. Available locations:Laser Targeting System  Description: Replaces reticle with red-dot aiming. Available for 10mm Pistol, Revolver, Machine Pistol, Combat Rifle, Sniper Rifle, Plasma Rifle and Heavy Rifle. Available locations:Rate-of-Fire Upgrade  Description: The Rate Increment upgrade optimizes the trigger and firing mechanisms of most handguns, rifles, and combat firearms, thereby increasing their cyclic rate of fire. Available locations:Reload Speed Upgrade  Description: The QuickFire Reload Kit improves the breech and feed mechanisms of most handguns, rifles, and combat firearms to decrease reloading time. Available locations:Silencer  Description: Sound suppressor, reduces the noise made when firing a gun. Available for 10mm Pistol, Machine Pistol, and Combat rifle. Available locations:Target-Leading System  Description: Anticipates a target's movement and shows where to shoot for a successful hit. For crossbows and tranquilizer rifles. Available locations:Target-Seeking System  Description: Allows automatic headshots after locking on to a target by moving the reticule over the target. Only works when the reticule is not too far from the target. Available for the combat rifle and machine pistol. It also has the extremely helpful ability to allow a weapon to accurately target enemies from behind cover without exposing the user to enemy fire, even while blindfiring. Available locations:Locations (by city) Detroit Hengsha Montreal Singapore Keycodes (DXHR)  Codes and passwords are often found: If you have the keycode for a particular lock it will be displayed on-screen and you can simply input the digits and bypass the hacking process (but this denies you the XP gain you'd get from the hack). Note that you do not have to discover the code in-game to be able to use it, hence this list.Hengsha  Hengsha (Chinese: \u6a6b\u6c99) is a location visited by Adam Jensen in Deus Ex: Human Revolution. Hengsha is a densely populated island off the coast of Shanghai in China.Background  Before 2027, a second street level was built above ground level, on top of an enormous structure called the Pangu. Nicknamed the Jewel of the Yangtze River, it is at the heart of the global augmentation industry, with Tai Yong Medical headquartered within the city. The lower city is divided into three major districts, Daigong, Kuaigan, and Youzhao, with various levels and sublevels. The roof level of the main district is home to the Hung Hua Hotel and The Hive. The Daigong district to the east is the walking path through to the Jiu Schichang District where the LIMB clinic and Alice Garden Pods are located, although there is also a subway train to/from Youzhao. Finally, the Youzhao district to the west is primarily residential district and is where the Court Gardens are located. There is also a sewer network underneath the city. Adam Jensen visits Hengsha in Deus Ex: Human Revolution twice. The first visit is to locate the hacker Arie van Bruggen and subsequently Zhao Yun Ru. The second visit is to find Vasili Sevchenko's GPL device. During the second visit, most Belltower guards will be hostile. Upper Hengsha and Lower Hengsha are complete opposites. In Lower Hengsha, the city is a dystopia riddled with crime and poverty; Belltower Associates are the police force, and\u00a0it is\u00a0dark and gloomy. Whereas in Upper Hengsha, it is a utopia. It is daylight during the first visit, so it is brighter, and when inside the TYM tower just after the Pangu, the city floor has grass and trees and all sorts of vibrant life that can be observed. Apparently, the citizens of Upper Hengsha are snobbish and not very friendly towards their Lower City counterparts.Locations Lower Hengsha Upper Hengsha Missions Main missions (part 1) Side quests (part 1) Main missions (part 2) Side quests (part 2) Vendors First Visit Second visit Trivia Deus Ex: Human Revolution characters  Characters from Deus Ex: Human Revolution.Weapons  Weapons are items used with the aim of causing harm or death to living creatures and for inflicting damage to infrastructures. For more details, please see:Types  Only in Deus Ex, weapons are divided into different types, each requiring a different weapon skill:Megan Reed  Megan Reed is the head of neuro-scientific research on augmentations at Sarif Industries and Adam Jensen's former romantic interest in Deus Ex: Human Revolution. In Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, she is working for Bob Page at one of his VersaLife facilities.Biography  Megan Reed was born in Seattle, Washington, in 1995, the only child of two doctors who both decided early on that family life would never interfere with their careers. She moved to North Carolina around 2009-2010 and then moved to France in 2012, where she graduated Magna Cum Laude in Neurology & Psychology. She returned to the United States in 2018 and was hired by Sarif Industries two years later as a genetic researcher. She became the head of the science team in 2023. As the head of neuro-scientific research on augmentations at Sarif Industries, Megan is in charge of advancing the applications of cybernetic augmentations for the company. David Sarif handpicked her due to her earlier work and extensive research in the field. It was also Megan who recommended Jensen for the job as chief of security.2027  In 2027, she was preparing to go to Washington D.C. along with her team of scientists to defend their research once again, but not before she confesses to Jensen that this new discovery is \"Rosetta Stone big\" and that what really worries her is being asked how she discovered it. She further reveals her uneasiness on this topic in an e-mail with Sarif, where she explains she is afraid of possible questions concerning the first sample and Patient X. In her Patient X study, Reed discovered a unique genome that could tolerate augmentations without suffering from Darrow Deficiency Syndrome (DDS). Before Reed could present her research, the Tyrants attack the Sarif Industries Headquarters. During the attack, she is rendered unconscious by Jaron Namir as she attempts to defend the maimed Jensen. Six months later she is stated to have been killed in the attack and official autopsies have apparently been performed. However, Reed was never explicitly shown to have been killed, causing speculation on whether or not she may still be alive among some of her former colleagues. In reality, she was not killed and instead taken to a FEMA camp at Highland Park so Isaias Sandoval could remove her and her team's GPL implants. However, Sandoval was unsuccessful at removing them so he lowered the frequency instead, making Sarif think they had been killed in the attack. After the frequency change, Reed and her team are taken to Hugh Darrow's Omega Ranch research facility in Singapore, where she is guarded over by Namir. Darrow eventually convinced her that allowing humanity to be freely augmented without restrictions, as her research would allow, was wrong, and got her to work for him. When Jensen finally finds and confronts her, she reveals that the Tyrants attack and kidnapping was real, as they wanted her and her research, but Darrow reassured her he was only pretending to work with TYM and the others to make sure their control signal would not work. She went along with it, not knowing Darrow had something more drastic in mind. With Jensen's help, Megan and the other kidnapped scientists escape the Singapore facility.The D Project  After the Aug Incident, Reed goes to work for Bob Page on a nanite-virus chimera - the D Project. Whether the nanite-virus chimera is the Gray Death, nanotechnological augmentations, the conception of JC Denton, or even just an intermediate predecessor to those technologies, currently remains unknown. Furthermore, it is not clear whether Reed knows that Page is a member of the Illuminati or the full consequences of her decision to work for him.2029  By 2029, Reed has taken a job at VersaLife's Roccasecca Beach facility at San Francisco to begin her life anew. Her first project, code named the Orchid, is a chemical agent that builds off her earlier research at Sarif Industries as a way to prevent augmentation rejection and, therefore, allow people to be augmented without the need for Neuropozyne. She appears to be oblivious to Page actually using it as a poison, expressing her concern about it being unstable and to always have the neutralizing enzyme (the cure) on hand at all times until she can stabilize it.Publications Trivia Quotes See Also References Cloak & Daggers  Cloak & Daggers is an optional side quest in Deus Ex: Human Revolution, and has a similarly named achievement/trophy for completing it. Jenny Alexander, an undercover cop and a friend of Adam Jensen's from the Detroit police force, is investigating a police officer named Jack O'Malley, suspected of corruption, and could use Jensen's help. She is found in the Detroit streets, near the entrance to Derelict Row, undercover with a group of prostitutes.Overview  Alexander requires four things from Jensen to lock down this case: While not necessary to complete the quest, Jensen can also recover a weapon that was used in a previous hit ordered by O'Malley. Staying hidden while in DRB territory will also aid Alexander's case. If one goes to the Police Station, Alexander's office is on the third floor, code 3727. On her wall, there is intel on Derelict Row: photographs pinpointing certain key enemies, loot stashes, and entry points.Walkthrough The Hit  O'Malley is located in the alley beside the Detroit Police Station. Jensen must meet him there and pose as the hitman to receive his assignments. O'Malley will be suspicious of Jensen, partly recognizing him as a former police officer, but by playing the part of the consummate professional Jensen can throw him off the track. O'Malley orders Jensen to retrieve the murder weapon from an alley, then use it to kill a Motor City Banger named Double-T, then plant the weapon to incite a gang war between the Bangers and the Ballers. If the player has the C.A.S.I.E. Social Enhancer augmentation, O'Malley can be appeased (He is an Alpha type personality.) to give a 1000  \"advance\" on the hitman job. The weapon, actually a Crossbow, can be found in the side alley entrance to Derelict Row.The Banger  Jensen's target, Double-T, can be found in one of the apartment complexes, the same one Seurat is in, on the third floor. The complex can be entered through the windows. He is guarded by five other Bangers, armed with shotguns and machine pistols. One Banger is outside guarding the hallway and is friendly, merely telling Jensen to piss off when he approaches. Three Bangers are in the living room - two watching the television, and one patrolling. The last bodyguard is with Double-T, in the bedroom. The bedroom door is locked with a level 3 terminal, but the code can be found on the Banger in the hallway (the code is 3733). Alternatively, one can enter the room from outside the hallway, by punching out a weakened wall. If you cannot get through either of these ways, fire a round from a non-silenced weapon directly outside the door and Double-T and the banger with him will open the door to look for you. Alexander wants Jensen to take Double-T alive - the stun gun is ideal for this. The other Bangers can be taken out with a nonlethal approach fairly easily as well - both the Banger in the hallway and the patrolling Banger can be taken out with melee takedowns, while the pair in the living room can be shot down with the tranquilizer rifle. The final bodyguard can be shot down from behind cover with the stun gun. Alternatively, everybody can be taken out with a single P.E.P.S. blast or Gas mine if lured into the hallway. (Warning: If the Banger that gives the warning cutscene is shot with stun gun, or Tranq regardless, it will result in a death, voiding Pacifist.) Various loot can be found in Double-T's apartment. This can be quite lucrative because there is a weapons dealer down the stairs. Instead of picking up all of the weapons at once (which converts them into ammunition), pick them up one at a time then carry them downstairs for a nice tidy profit. (example: One shotgun = 750 , shotgun ammo = 50  or less) This can help if the player is having trouble getting the praxis software from the LIMB clinic.O'Malley's Apartment  O'Malley's apartment can be found in the same complex as Brian Tindall's. Although the apartment door only has a level 2 terminal, the bedroom door has a level 4 terminal, and the necessary evidence is located within the bedroom. Bedroom code is 1029. NOTE: Instead of hacking the outside gate, the player can stack a crate on top of the dumpster next to it to gain access to the apartment complex from the fire escape, or use the gate code 0002. NOTE: Inside his apartment, there is a pocket secretary on the bottom shelf, across from his desk and next to a plant, that contains the security code to the bedroom. NOTE: Inside his bedroom, there is a safe beside the computer with a level 3 terminal. The safe's code is 1031. The evidence required is a shipment of drugs in O'Malley's bedroom. Picking it up will complete this portion of the quest, but you can also find a weapon case on his bed and more evidence can be found on his computer. A large quantity of loot can be found in the bedroom. The bedroom is rigged with several frag mines. One of them has a large box in front of it - attempting to pick up the box will immediately detonate the mine, killing the player. Crouch-walking and manually disarming the mines will allow Jensen to retrieve them, or the player can manually detonate them by shooting them from afar. Another method would be to quickly run part way into the room, and then sprinting back out before the detonation kills Jensen. A third method is throwing one of the boxes from outside the bedroom inside. This will detonate all the mines with no risk or ammo loss.The Weapons Shipment  Jensen must infiltrate Derelict Row to find the incriminating weapons shipment. Upon entering the actual complex and thus entering Derelict Row Baller territory, all Ballers encountered by the player will be hostile. Getting seen will also fail the optional portion of this sidequest. NOTE: If you kill and/or knock out all the enemies in the area BEFORE receiving this quest, completing the side objective of not being seen will be trivial. The shipment is located under the flooring in one of the north-eastern buildings, on level 1 though that area is not indicated on the map., It can be reached either through crawling under the crawlspace, the sewers, or through a nearby door. Aside from the shipment itself, the crawlspace also has several weapons, frag grenades, and a weapons upgrade. Hidden on the wall here is the famous Dopefish.Conclusion  Upon completing these four objectives, the player should meet with Alexander again to report their progress. Handing over the crossbow to Alexander, taking down Double-T alive, and having found the weapons shipment without ever being seen by the Ballers will complete the optional portions of this quest. If the player chooses not to give the crossbow in, the player will not receive the weapons upgrade but will still complete the quest. (If you mod the crossbow during this quest handing it over will not be possible) Alexander then prepares to make the final arrest. Jensen can either have her do it, or do it himself. NOTE: If Jensen declines the final arrest option, Jenny will actually give Jensen a repeat mission reward of both credits and the weapon mod if he handed over the crossbow murder weapon to her as well. (Confirmed) This second bonus reward may be a glitch in the game as the action could be getting read as a secondary unintentional end of mission trigger, whereas doing the extra work and taking O'Malley down personally does not net you anything other than completion of the mission story arc and the normal end of mission reward of one mod and 1000  you would have already received when turning in the evidence including the crossbow murder weapon and a slightly different ending comment from Jenny. NOTE: If Jensen declines the final arrest option but does hand the crossbow over, he can kill or knock Jenny out to take the crossbow back after the quest rewards are given. Otherwise, if Jensen arrests O'Malley himself, Jenny will not carry the crossbow anymore. If the player opts to have Jensen arrest O'Malley, he can be found in his apartment. He will attempt to bribe Jensen with an \"enviable amout of money\" (3000 ) - Jensen can either let him go (and receive The Take achievement after talking to Jenny Alexander again), or decline, in which case O'Malley will pull out a pistol and try to kill him. Taking him alive is preferable for completing this quest - again, the stun gun or a quick punch is ideal for this. You do not even need to speak with O'Malley, and can simply walk around his desk and take him down. Speaking to him, however, nets you 300 points for 'Completionist' versus the 100 for simply dropping him.Glitches Possible solutions Video Guide  The following guide will help you infiltrate Derelict Row without being detected AND without killing anyone -- Pacifist approved!Jaron Namir  Jaron Namir (Hebrew: \u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05df \u05e0\u05de\u05d9\u05e8) is a mechanically augmented soldier and one of the main antagonists of Deus Ex: Human Revolution. He acts as Field Commander of the elite black ops team known as the Tyrants and also as a private military contractor for Belltower Associates.Background Early life  Known for his merciless nature as a killer, Jaron hides a private life as a religious and devoted family man. He is married to a woman named Laya and has two children. When he was nineteen, his sister Melina was killed during a supposed car accident in Haifa. Several years later he was recruited into Israel's Intelligence Agency, the Mossad and psychological profiling conducted there indicated a deep-seated guilt over Melina's death; Jaron later named his daughter after her. Ben Saxon speculates that his scars and augmentations are due to injuries sustained during the Pan-Arab invasion and occupation of Israel.Illuminati agent  Later he formed the secret black ops team, the Tyrants, and became the leader of Belltower's Elite Special Operations Unit. As a Tyrant operative, he worked in secret for the Illuminati, performing clandestine operations. Later he recruited Lawrence Barrett, Yelena Fedorova, Scott Hardesty, and Joe Wexler. In 2027, he and the group attacked the meeting between Senator Jane Skyler and Garret Dansky, CEO of Caidin Global. They assassinated Dansky, but they let Senator Skyler live, and newly recruited Gunther Hermann killed Secret Service Agent Matt Ryan. However, his partner, Agent Anna Kelso, killed Wexler in retaliation. She suffered stomach injuries, but managed to survive. To replace Wexler, Namir, presumably under orders from the Illuminati, attacked Belltower Strike Team Six during fake Operation Rainbird, killing all team members save for Ben Saxon, who was left to recover in a SAF hospital. Later, Namir approached him with a proposition to join the Tyrants, an independent special operations team that does not follow the rigidity of more official groups. After Namir promised to help track down the people responsible for Team Six's deaths, Saxon agreed to join. Namir sent Saxon, Hermann, and Hardesty to the Hotel Novoe Rostov in Moscow to kill Mikhail Kontarsky, administrator of the Russian committee on Human Augmentation. The mission was a success, but Ben and Gunther were both tazed and knocked out onboard the Tyrants' private plane and brought into a small room in Jaron's home. When they awoke, Jaron explained that one of them is a traitor to the group and the two must fight to the death to determine which. He threw a handgun with a single round and the two fought over it. Ben eventually managed to get the pistol, but refused to kill Gunther. Namir then revealed that the fight was just a test between the two, and that the round was a blank.Human Revolution & Icarus Effect  At Romeo Airport in Michigan, the Tyrants' base of operations, Jaron and the group were planning an attack on Sarif Industries Headquarters in Detroit, to stop them from sharing their research of controlled and perfected human evolution with the world, and also to kidnap their top scientists before they could converge with the National Science Board in Washington D.C. To do so, Jaron sent Saxon, Hardesty, and Hermann to Virginia to kill Ron Temple of the Secret Service. At Sarif Industries, Jaron, Barret, and Fedorova killed most of the scientists; Jaron disarmed and brutally wounded the head of security, Adam Jensen, by throwing him through a thick pane of glass. But when he was about to deliver the finishing blow, Megan Reed threw a barrel of corrosive substance at him, which covered and wounded Namir, forcing him to drop Adam. Namir backhanded Megan, knocking her unconscious, then turned around to shoot Adam in the head with his Diamond Back .357.After the Attack  Back at Romeo Airport, Namir mentioned to the group that they were planning another major operation in Europe, and that Yelena was currently handling a job of her own. Once in the air, Hardesty warned Namir that Ben Saxon was a liability, too sympathetic to be useful in their operations, but Namir reminded him that Saxon was experienced enough to be useful regardless, and that everyone on the team was expendable if necessary. Later aboard the plane, Namir entered the Killing Floor, where Saxon was reading Namir's terminal and next mission, and admitted that he was responsible for Strike Team Six's failure. Saxon, armed only with a stun gun, shot the terminal, causing a power failure and setting off several fire alarms, but was cut off by the other members. With no other means of escape, Saxon opened the cargo bay doors and jumped out into the sky above the Atlantic Ocean. In Geneva, Switzerland, the Tyrants planned to assassinate Humanity Front founder Bill Taggart on the steps of the Palais de Nations. The assassination would make him a martyr for the anti-aug cause and push for a vote on UN regulations on mechanical augmentation. To prevent Saxon from interfering with their plan, Jaron detonated the plane, took Anna Kelso hostage, and blackmailed Saxon to killing Taggart himself in plain public view.Failed Hit  On board the Icarus yacht, Namir learned about the failed assassination of Taggart and the death of Hardesty. The three remaining Tyrants planned to fly to a remote base by a VTOL, taking Anna with them. Just as they were about to take off, the cockpit opened and Saxon emerged, having already killed the pilot. Namir decided to challenge Saxon to a one-on-one fight, eager to avenge Hardesty. With his advanced combat augmentations, Namir easily overpowered Saxon, but at the last moment Saxon pulled out a Zenith pistol he snagged from the Pilot. He shot Namir in the chest 3 times, which managed to subdue him even with his dermal augs (most likely due to the injuries he sustained back at Sarif Industries). Saxon trained the gun on Namir's head, but Barrett threatened to kill Anna if he killed their leader. Saxon lowered his gun and begrudgingly let them go again. With the police closing in, the Tyrants left by VTOL, claiming that the Media will turn the day's events in their favor, even with half of their team dead or missing. They flew off, leaving Saxon and Kelso to die aboard the Icarus. In Paris, a young Morgan Everett and Lucius DeBeers recollected about the operation in Geneva, and Morgan claimed that even with Bill Taggart alive, the assassination attempt had pushed the United Nations to hold a conference on regulating mechanical augmentation, just like Namir said.Highland Park  Six months after the Sarif Industries attack, Namir, Barrett, and Fedorova, along with several Belltower operatives, were in the lower levels of an abandoned bot factory complex in Highland Park, which served as a front for a FEMA internment camp. Here, they met with a newly augmented Adam Jensen, and Jaron ordered Barrett to get rid of him, before slipping away with Fedorova. Though Jensen would defeat Barrett and obtain the location of Windmill from him, Namir would once again escape.The Death of The Snake  Jensen would not encounter Namir again until much later in Singapore. There Jensen encountered Zhao Yun Ru, who attempted to disable Jensen with her universal killswitch. If Jensen had opted for the free biochip upgrade at Hengsha LIMB clinic, the killswitch will shut off all of Jensen's augmentations, making the upcoming boss fight significantly harder. Namir would then reveal himself and engage Jensen with the words \"You should have stayed dead, Jensen!\", and Jensen would be forced to kill him once and for all. Before Namir died, Jensen demanded that he reveal Megan's location. Namir told Jensen that he had lost Megan, and that \"Men like us... We never get back the things we love\", possibly referring to his sister.Tactics  See Namir Tactics for tactical suggestions on how to defeat Namir.Augmentations  Namir, being a Tyrant, is significantly more augmented than the average person. He is perhaps the most augmented character in the game, with over 90% of his body being completely mechanised. His most noticable augmentations are a unique set of dermal armor and mechanical limbs designed in tribute to the human musculoskeletal system, with minor changes (such as two-toed feet, and a thinner torso section). Namir's head appears to be the only biological part of his person (aside from his left eye). It is covered in numerous grooves and bolts reminiscent of electronic implants. These implant points lie along the scar-lines on his face. It can be assumed that Namir has most, if not all, the augmentations available to the player in the game, as shown by his combat prowess.Trivia Bugs See also Weapons in Deus Ex: Human Revolution  This is the category page for weapons in Deus Ex: Human Revolution.Shanghai Justice  Shanghai Justice is an optional side quest in Deus Ex: Human Revolution. It is given to the player by Faridah Malik.Introduction  After receiving Arie van Bruggen's location from Tong Si Hung at the Hive, Jensen arrives at Alice Garden Pods to find the elusive hacker, but runs into Faridah Malik instead. After some persuasion, the pilot admits to Jensen that she is here to settle a personal matter and could use Jensen's help.Overview  When Malik lived in Hengsha previously, she had a close friend named Evelyn Carmichael. The trusting Evelyn had a bad boyfriend by the name of Lee Hong, son of the prestigious and wealthy Hong family. The relationship came to a disastrous end when Carmichael was found dead. The official story was an alcohol-induced rooftop fall, but Malik always had her doubts. Now that she is back in Hengsha, she wants to revive the investigation, but needs Jensen's help. Jensen needs to do his own investigation and then confront Lee to get the whole story.Requirements  Finishing this mission \"correctly\", and not ruining your Pacifist streak, will require hacking a level 3 terminal. If you do not have the necessary skill or access to an Automatic Unlocking Device, you will need to kill Lee at the end of the mission. You will miss out on a bit of XP as well as a Praxis Kit, but you will at least be able to complete the mission. It is possible to enter the correct code (found in the Walkthrough section) into the terminal instead of hacking it. However, under normal circumstances the code cannot be found in-game.Walkthrough  The first step of Jensen's investigation is recovering the materials from the first investigation. Malik suggests foul play as the death was never properly investigated, and merely labelled as a suicide. Jensen can find these materials in Pod 009 in Alice Garden Pods - they include a pocket secretary and an eBook, and contain some police reports and some news clippings from the incident. Next Jensen must meet with Malik's source within the LIMB clinic, someone known only as Anonymous X, to obtain Carmichael's autopsy report. Hengsha hires private help to run many state functions - Belltower runs the police force, and apparently the LIMB clinic runs autopsies. Malik gives Jensen a pass phrase to identify himself once he finds the source. Anonymous X is the man with the hat in the LIMB clinic behind the glass; he is not in the \"lobby\" but is behind the counter, and there is no marker above his head to identify him. After identifying himself, he meets Jensen outside, where he gives him the autopsy report. He then attempts to extort Jensen for an additional 1000 credits. It's up to the player whether he wants to pay him or not. (If the player does pay him 1000 credits, he can be knocked out and the credits can be retrieved from his inventory after the conversation. Moreover, if the player doesn't have 1000 credits, the option to pay is still available, although Jensen will say that he doesn't have enough credits and that X will have to bill Jensen later, which apparently never happens.) As expected, the injuries and wounds Carmichael suffered do not line up with a rooftop fall at all: she was not intoxicated at the time. In addition, the report also reveals that Evelyn was pregnant at the time. (There is a bug here, sometimes saving/loading can move the autopsy report to the bottom of your emails list.) Malik suggests Jensen confront Lee next. But when Jensen arrives at Lee's apartment in the Youzhao district by either hacking the terminal next to his door or breaking it, the apartment is empty. Alternatively, Jensen can enter the key-code of \"1234\" to get in. Jensen decides to look around and gather more clues. First Jensen needs to check Lee's computer. There he finds an angry e-mail from Lee's father, promising an end to his lavish lifestyle and legal immunities if he does not stop his shameful and whoring behavior. It also reveals that the family has deep connections with both Belltower and LIMB International. Next Jensen should check Lee's answering machine, where he learns Lee has gone to the Hive. Near the entrance to the apartment is a baseball bat, which is Jensen's next clue. Though Jensen's not done yet - in Lee's bedroom on top of the dresser is the final clue - a busted antique clock with the hands stopping at the estimated time of death: a possible murder weapon. Now Jensen is ready to confront Lee. Lee can be found on the upper floor of the Hive by himself. The goal is to get him to admit to the murder while Malik is recording the conversation, and to this end Jensen pretends to blackmail him. The player must review all of the clues so far so that Jensen can sufficiently pass himself off as knowing the whole story and bluff Lee: Correctly picking the right information each time will eventually cause Lee to panic giving a full confession, unlocking the Super Sleuth achievement. At this point, you have a choice:Behind the Scene  Dialogue in this mission reference the Christopher Nolan film \"Insomnia\"(2002)Talion A.D.  Talion A.D. is a side quest in Deus Ex: Human Revolution during Adam Jensen's second visit to Hengsha. Completing this quest unlocks an achievement/trophy of the same name.Overview  To start this side mission the player will need to go to the LIMB clinic in the Jiu Shichang District (if approaching from the subway in the Youzhao district) or the northernmost section of the Kuaigan district (if already in said district). This quest is only available during the second visit to Hengsha Island, after the scripted sequence showing a severe biochip glitch (in the case of a civilian, a nearly fatal glitch). Speak to Dr. Wing, who will be standing with a clipboard to the left of the LIMB desk and terminal. He will ask you to find an ex-Belltower operative, Michael Zelazny.Primary objectives Locate the butcher shop where Zelazny is hiding  In the Youzhao district.Enter the back room of the butcher shop  Self-explanatoryFind information on Zelazny's current whereabouts  The body at the bottom of the stairs has a pocket secretary that must be collected. For the next objective, no map point will be added, making it necessary to go off the clues.Read the dead agent's pocket secretary  The passage mentions the sewers, so travel back to the Jiu Shichang District (Northern Kuaigan district) and find an entrance to the sewers. The sewage entrance is in the sewage strip in front of the Alice Garden Pods where you fought the goons during the side quest Corporate Warfare.Deal with Zelazny and his team  Once inside the sewers turn left then left again. Zelazny and his men will be standing nearby. The player can follow a series of inquiries and then either fight them, or side with Zelazny, thereby letting him go to finish his mission (his mission is to kill the \"corrupt officials\" who used experimental augmentations to control his team and used them as an assassination squad). Zelazny cannot be reasoned with and will attack the player if the \"reason\" option is used three times during the conversation; in addition, like Faridah Malik he is not affected by the CASIE Augmentation and will point this out if the player tries to use it. The only options are to fight him or let him go. If you fight him, it makes no difference if you talk to him first and the quest will be completed either way. Zelazny and his men can be knocked out; the quest doesn't make a distinction between lethal and non-lethal methods. One benefit of letting Zelazny go is that, after you exit the sewer, he contacts you to say that he has called some Belltower operatives and they will leave their patrols in the area, making it easier to move around Hengsha.Return to Dr. Wing  Once Zelazny and his men have been dealt with, return to Dr. Wing at the LIMB Clinic. Depending on the choice of actions with Zelazny, you may need to lie to Dr. Wing or convince him of the morality of his actions in order to receive a Praxis kit as a reward. Dr. Wing's dialogue will not change if the player knocked Zelazny out instead of killing him.Suggested tactics Notes Trivia Augmentations (DXHR)  In Deus Ex: Human Revolution, Adam Jensen has several mechanical augmentations implanted in his body to save his life after he is almost killed by Jaron Namir during an attack on Sarif Industries. Unlike in previous games, nano-augmentations are not used since they have not advanced to a sufficient level yet. Most of the augmentations remain inactive until Jensen has mentally healed and adapted to them or upgrade software is installed. These augmentations are installed into slots in various parts of the body. The choice is permanent, so once the augmentation is activated, it cannot be undone for the remainder of the game. Unlike previous iterations, players are not required to find specific items for specific augmentation slots; you may activate any augmentation at any time so long as you have the required Praxis points. The augmentation menu is divided between body parts: Head, Eyes, Torso, Arms, Back, Skin and Legs. Below is a list of the augmentations and their functions:Cranium Hacking: Capture  Info: At its most basic level, the Hacking Device gives its user the CPU clock cycles necessary to attempt a data penetration of target computer systems before triggering any intrusion counter-measures or alarms. At advanced levels of operation, the augmentation facilitates direct interface with other electronic security and tactical devices. Implanted in the cranium, the MHD-995 Hacking Device is a dedicated microcomputer module featuring a series of processors and databases, programmed with multiple code-breaking and counter-cryptography subroutines. When deployed, the hacking device provides immediate assistance to any user attempting to bypass, shut down or otherwise override electronic systems via a standard terminal interface. The unit is capable of identifying and providing I-War intrusion solutions for over fifteen million discrete software barriers. Activation Cost: N/ACapture 1 Capture 2 Capture 3 Capture 4 Capture 5 Camera Domination Turret Domination Robot Domination Hacking: Analyze  Info: Use of the Network Scout Electronic Systems Analysis Augmentation in conjunction with a hacking augmentation device provides the user with important information during a hacking scenario, including the percentage likelihood of detection, content of APIs, and/or content of datastores. Compatible with all top-line hacking augmentations, the Network Scout is a cranial implantation that provides instantaneous feedback on every aspect of an electronic intrusion. Upon access, highly specialized scripts issue forth to relay data back to the parent hacking augmentation, efficiently employing its inherent functionality to present crucial real-time status. Activation Cost: 1 Praxis PointDetection Feedback Analyze All Datastores Hacking: Fortify  Info: The software defenses provided by the Costikyan NeuralOptics Node Fortifier instantly turn any captured node into an intruder asset against the host system, rendering it both a barrier against detection, and a solid beach-head from which to launch further intrusion. The power of these defenses are variable, determined by the user's skill and preference. Activation Cost: N/AFortify 1 Fortify 2 Fortify 3 Hacking: Stealth  Info: Given enough time, even the most advanced electronic system can be penetrated. The MHD-995SH Informational Warfare Obfuscation Augmentation provides that mission-critical time with software as sophisticated as that found within any defense grid. A natural companion to the MHD-995 Tactical Informational Warfare Augmentation, the MHD-995SH Informational Warfare Obfuscation Augmentation slots neatly beside that device within the cranium. During an intrusion scenario, the Obfuscation Augmentation actively transmits misdirection and noise packets throughout the target system, alternately confusing and confounding active software defenses, decreasing the likelihood of detection by intrusion countermeasures. Activation Cost: 1 Praxis PointStealth 1 Stealth 2 Stealth 3 Wayfinder Radar System  Info: In its basic mode, the Wayfinder Radar System gives the user a limited-range 'radar' indicator, which is projected directly on to the retina optical user interface. In its advanced mode, the augmentation's detection threshold can be increased, and the movement of targets can be tracked even beyond visual range. The Radar System augmentation is an enhancement of the Eye-Know Retinal Prosthesis, providing a rudimentary 'radar' scope that displays the location of designated units, including enemy combatants, electronic devices, or other targets of interest. The augmentation consists of a cranial implant that contains the core processor, ranging and detection system and a connective link to the user's visual cortex. Activation Cost: N/ARadar 1 Radar 2 Infolink  Info: The Infolink Telecommunications Package enables users to receive and transmit messages without generating audible sounds through implanted cochlear and vibration detection devices. Video signals accompanying incoming transmissions are projected directly onto the user's retina, provided an Eye-Know Retinal Prosthesis is also implanted. At its most basic level, the package uses tight-band microwave signals when sending and receiving. With experience, users can obtain mastery over wideband transmissions as well, enabling them to interface with line-of-sight computer terminals or similar devices. Activation Cost: N/ACochlear Implant Subvocal Communication Implant Social Enhancer  Info: The C.A.S.I.E. implant provides its user with a direct monitor of behavior patterns and likely responses from conversational subjects. In real terms, this means the user can gain an insight into which conversational methods to employ in any given situation, discover subtle clues and intentions, and view a virtual 'persuasion' gauge for their target. The Computer-Assisted Social Interaction Enhancer is a cranial implant that ties directly in to the user's existing Eye-Know Retinal Prosthesis to relay environmental and personal data about targeted individuals, in order to assist social interaction. The C.A.S.I.E. implant uses an Optical Psychophysiological Responses Analyzer (aka 'Optical Polygraph') to gauge a rudimentary psychological profile based on facial expression, body language, and environmental cues. Combined with the advanced Emotional Intelligence Enhancer software engine, the system can deliver real-time predictive data directly to the user, enabling them to correctly interpret responses and draw the desired result from face-to-face conversations. For more information, and a list of Personality Types, see Social Enhancer. Activation Cost: 2 Praxis PointsEmotional Intelligence Enhancer Stealth Enhancer  Info: In its most basic mode, the Stealth Monitor augmentation provides users with an ambient noise feedback indicator, projected directly on to their optical display. In its advanced mode, the augmentation can provide a rudimentary tracking scope, capable of showing the sight lines of observed enemy units. A cranial implant with a series of hair-thin dermal sensors (typically implanted along the crown of the skull), the stealth enhancer ties in to existing vision augmentations and provides a direct feedback to the level of ambient sound generated by the user. The implant's central processing unit can also perform instant situation-based analysis of targets identified via line-of-sight and is capable of predicting the vision cones of these targets with great accuracy, even after loss of direct observation. Activation Cost: 2Cones of Vision Noise Feedback Last Known Location Marker Mark and Track 1.0 Mark and Track 2.0 Mark and Track 3.0 Eyes Smart Vision  Info: An optical membrane implant that enables people already equipped with the Eye-Know Retinal Prosthesis to visually scan through walls, doors, and cover objects and see what lies beyond. This augmentation implants the human eye with a series of suspended organic-plastic lenses which, in turn, use embedded circuitry to build on the basic data-frame provided by the Eye-Know Retinal Prosthesis. By interfacing directly with the synthetic neural tissue spike that is connected to the optic nerve, it provides the implanted prosthesis with the ability to match visual silhouettes and body kinetics to micro-thermograph and t-wave lens modules, thus providing a limited degree of \u201cx-ray vision\u201d through walls and light cover. Activation Cost: 2 Praxis PointsWall-Penetrating Imager Retinal Prosthesis  Info: The Eye-Know Retinal Prosthesis is the basic 'chassis' for all optical augmentations and must be implanted in both eyes before further, more specialized devices can be purchased. The HUD projected by the prosthesis provides data on the user's medical condition, available equipment, wireless access to personal data storage, and direct audio/visual telecommunications. An optical membrane implant and data-frame for vision augmentations, this device is a microthin base coating layered onto the inside of the human eye, with a synthetic neural tissue spike connected to the optic nerve; it is capable of projecting digital information directly on to the retina. Activation Cost: N/ARetinal HUD Flash Suppressant Cooldown Timer Arms Cybernetic Arm Prosthesis  Info: The Cybernetic Arm Prosthesis replaces the user's organic limbs with enhanced-function mechanical substitutes. Initially, the augmentation allows the user to engage in impressive feats of close-quarter unarmed combat. As the user grows more comfortable with his or her new arm, the range of available skills widens to include punching through light walls, displacing heavy objects, carrying at an increased capacity, and compensating for weapon recoil. The Cybernetic Arm Prosthesis (class 7, as mentionned by a Sarif employee before Jensen goes to the Milwaukee factory) is an augmented artificial limb built on a framework of advanced polymers and lightweight metals. In place of an organic musculature, these augmentations utilize myomers -- bunches of electro-stimulated plastic cables that mimic the actions of muscle tissues, but to a greatly strengthened degree. In combination with tiny motors and shock-absorbing liquid polymer buffers, these cyber-limbs are capable of far exceeding human physical abilities. Activation Cost: N/AInstant Take-Down Punch Through Wall Recoil Compensation 1 Recoil Compensation 2 Move/Throw Heavy Objects Carrying Capacity 1 Carrying Capacity 2 Carrying Capacity 3 Aim Stabilizer  Info: The direct practical effect of the Aim Stabilizer is to reduce the radius of the 'traveling reticule' displayed on the user's optic interface, designating the target zone generated by a given firearm. The motion-dampening, stability-inducing augmentation narrows the firing zone, allowing the user to aim at targets with greater efficiency while moving. A cranial implant mechanism, the Aim Stabilizer is a decentralized augmentation with elements embedded in the user's nerve-brain connections, inner ear structure, and optic nerves,. From second to second, the augmentation reads and processes inputs from the user's innate senses for balance and orientation and modifies them accordingly based on current circumstances; thus, the user's sense of balance and hand-to-eye muscle control is regulated and enhanced, providing a greater stability even at speed or while in extreme motion. Activation Cost: 2 Praxis PointsAiming Motion Control 1 Aiming Motion Control 2 Torso Sentinel RX Health System  Info: The Sentinel RX Health System is a combination implant that uses electro-cardio action, adrenal stimuli, and protein therapy to fight infection and injury throughout a limited 'regenerative' capacity. While it is no replacement for proper medical care, it can keep a user alive in the most critical of circumstances. A decentralized augmentation made up of several smaller units; the primary components are a series of hair-fine sensor probes connected to all the vital organs, providing real-time biomedical data to a central health monitor unit. This unit tracks the medical condition of the user and triggers secondary modules when it registers the incidence of critical damage through internal or external trauma; these modules are implanted in heart tissue, the lymphatic system and adrenal glands, and utilize micro-electric charges and phased-released chemicals to stimulate the human body's healing reaction. Activation Cost: N/ACardiovertor Defibrillator Angiogenesis Protein Therapy Implanted Rebreather  Info: Concealed in the chest cavity, this augmentation activates in the presence of airborne toxins such as tear gas or aerosol poisons, rendering them ineffective. It cannot reduce damage from airborne radioactive contaminants or particle energy effects, however. Secondary functionality gives people equipped with the Rebreather augmentation an additional 'reservoir' of oxygen in the bloodstream, allowing them to surpass the normal limits of fatigue associated with sustained sprinting. The Rebreather augmentation's core components are implanted in the primary bronchi, where the lungs join the trachea. The device is a combination of nanomesh filter and oxygen circulation unit (a compact, closed-circuit rebreather), which recycles and cleanses indrawn breaths before passing them on to the lungs. In addition, chemical exchange reactants injected into the alveoli assist in the process of blood oxygenation, enabling the user to resist exhaustion from extended physical efforts, such as sprinting. Activation Cost: 2 Praxis PointsChemical Resistance Hyper-Oxygenation 1 Hyper-Oxygenation 2 Sarif Series 8 Energy Converter  Info: The Sarif Series 8 Energy Converter gives users the ability to maximize the energy available to any and all of their neuroaugmentations by transforming ordinary food to energy within augmentation-specific cells. With practice, these cells can increase in number and efficiency, ensuring that energy will always be there when needed. Employing processes similar to those whereby the human digestive system converts organic nutrients from food into electrochemical energy, the Sarif Series 8 Energy Converter further adapts electrochemicals into neuroenhancement-specific potential, first creating discrete capacitors, and then charging those cells with augmentation-dedicated energy. Activation Cost: N/ABase Energy Level Energy Level Upgrade 1 Energy Level Upgrade 2 Energy Level Upgrade 3 Base Recharge Rate Recharge Rate Upgrade 1 Recharge Rate Upgrade 2 Typhoon Explosive System  Info: In effect, the Typhoon augmentation turns its user into a human fragmentation grenade, placing him or her at the center of a blast radius that inflicts a ranged sphere of damage on surrounding targets, in all directions, without focus or aim. Every detonation requires the expenditure of one ammo pack and one energy cell. The Typhoon is an anti-personnel weapon implanted in a series of subdermal pads along the back of the user's arms, upper legs, and torso; the pads are loaded with a matrix of small (10mm) stainless steel ball bearings above a thin layer of fixed-focus electromagnetic repulsion field generators. On activation, the implant releases the ball bearings in an optimal 360\u00b0 shrapnel shockwave cloud that inflicts severe damage on unarmored targets at close range, and an additional blowback effect on middle-distant targets. Activation Cost: 2 Praxis PointsLight Damage Variant Heavy Damage Variant Back Icarus Landing System  Info: The Icarus Landing System is a discreet augmentation surgically implanted in the user's lower back, slightly above the coccyx at the base of the vertebral column. The device has an accelerative descent sensor built in; in freefall, the unit will automatically activate the patented High-Fall Safeguard System, an EMF decelerator generating a fixed-focus electromagnetic lensing field, projected downward along the plane of the drop. This field pushes against the Earth's magnetosphere and slows the user's descent to a manageable velocity, allowing him to fall from almost any height (within reason). Activation Cost: 2 Praxis Points Note: The Icarus Landing System animation requires a fairly significant fall to trigger; however, the augmentation's actual gameplay effect is to completely disable fall damage, regardless of whether the animation plays or not.Descent Velocity Modulator Quicksilver Reflex Booster  Info: The Quicksilver Reflex Booster is essentially a supercharger for the human nervous system, boosting reflex speed and the firing of nerve clusters throughout the body. The direct effect of this means that the user is capable of reacting far faster than a 'normal' person in a dangerous situation, enabling him or her to move quickly with split focus to engage more than one adversary. The Quicksilver Reflex Booster is a decentralized augmentation connected to nerve bundles in the legs, to a distributed set of disc implants in the spinal column, and to other elements of the body's vestibular system (which controls balance and agility). Working in concert, these elements send and receive digital pressure signals to a series of implanted integrated circuits, granting increased agility and corporeal control. Activation Cost: 2 Praxis PointsMultiple Take-Down Skin Glass-Shield Cloaking System  Info: When activated, the Glass-Shield Cloaking System augmentation bends the light hitting the user, rendering him practically invisible. The effect will work on any wavelength that is part of the visual spectrum, including laser beams. The Glass-Shield Cloaking System is composed of a grid of fine induction wires connected to a deep-tissue control implant (typically located in the back or ribcage) which, in turn, is linked to the brain. The matrix can be layered directly beneath the surface of the epidermis or over the plating of cybernetic limbs; when activated, it generates a tuned, fixed-focus electromagnetic field that temporarily adjusts the frequency of EM radiation around the user. The net effect is a 'cloak of invisibility' which appears near-perfect. Activation Cost: 2 Praxis PointsBase Longevity Longevity Upgrade 1 Longevity Upgrade 2 Dermal Armor  Info: Essentially a technologically-advanced version of implanted body armor, this augmentation is able to reduce inflicted damage effects from blunt trauma, ballistic attacks, cutting, and/or slashing attacks. Secondary functionality also provides protection from electromagnetic pulse (EMP) assault. However, Dermal Armor cannot reduce damage effects from airborne contaminants such as gas, environmental effects (radiation, toxins and poisons), or falling trauma. Rhino Dermal Armor is a supple, micro-thin material implanted beneath the epidermis in key areas of the body, as well as over the surface of pre-existing cybernetic limbs. The structure of the plating is a phased composite; the base is a microfiber weave made from carbon nanotubes suspended in a dilatant (or shear-thickening) fluid. When kinetic energy from a physical blow or a weapon discharge strikes the plating, the fluid becomes rigid, deflecting the impact shock. Heat and electromagnetically-conductive elements in the armor matrix serve to dissipate damage from fire-related or energized trauma. Activation Cost: 2 Praxis PointsDamage Reduction 1 Damage Reduction 2 Damage Reduction 3 EMP Shielding Legs Cybernetic Leg Prosthesis  Info: The Cybernetic Leg Prosthesis replaces a person's organic limbs with enhanced-function mechanical substitutes. On a basic level, these grant the user the ability to reach greater heights while jumping. Additional functionalities, including enhanced jump range, greater sprint speed, and the ability to move without audible detection, become possible as familiarity with the augmentation increases. The Hermes 2027 Cybernetic Leg Prosthesis is an augmented artificial limb built on a framework of advanced polymers and lightweight metals. In place of an organic musculature, these augmentations utilize 'myomers'-bunches of electro-stimulated plastic cables that mimic the actions of muscle tissues, but to a greatly strengthened degree. In combination with tiny motors and shock-absorbing liquid polymer buffers, these cyberlimbs are capable of far exceeding human physical attributes. Activation Cost: 2 Praxis PointsJump Enhancement Sprint Enhancement Run Silently Sprint Silently Jump/Land Silently Trivia Yelena Fedorova  Yelena Fedorova (Cyrillic: \u0415\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0424\u0451\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430) is an antagonist in the book Deus Ex: Icarus Effect  and the game Deus Ex: Human Revolution. She is a senior member of the Tyrants.Background  With an athletic build and statuesque, augmented height of 6'7\", Yelena Fedorova was a trained assassin, part of an elite team of special operations mercenaries working for Belltower Associates, a private military corporation. A Russian woman of African descent with a cut of shoulder-length, spiky black hair, she was rarely seen out of her combat gear. Her only affectations were a silver cross on a black steel chain around her neck, a family heirloom of great personal value, and sometimes a nose ring as seen to the right. She had progressive mechanical augmentations; her legs had been extended with unguligrade prosthetics that enable her to move quietly and quickly. These augmentations also gave her at least a foot height boost, giving her an intimidating figure. According to Eliza Cassan, Fedorova witnessed the murder of her entire family as a child and suffers from consequential mental health issues. Yelena is a ruthless and resourceful combatant, never choosing frontal assault, when another approach will more easily destroy her enemies with less effort. When she moves, she does so with unexpected agility, speed, and grace - a cobra uncoiling rapidly as it strikes. Yelena has become adept at vigilance and is cautious of everything around her; she's not easy to sneak up on, and usually has a plan for every eventuality. Yelena had a one-night stand with Ben Saxon - possibly revealing that she has some need for human comfort. Sometime before 2027, she is sent to kill Secret Service agent Anna Kelso, who knows too much about her superior's mysterious work and is considering joining the Juggernaut Collective. Later, she is involved in a confrontation between Anna, Ben Saxon, and the two other surviving Tyrant operatives. She is shot with an adhesive non-lethal shotgun round, but she is otherwise unharmed. In 2027, Fedorova is part of the black ops team that attacks Sarif Industries research labs, where she kills many security guards and scientists. She prefers hit-and-run tactics: in one instance, she blitzed several guards with dual Hurricane SMGs before cloaking and retreating to a better position afterwards. Later, she and Lawrence Barrett returned from a failed mission to retrieve a Neural Hub from a dead augmented Purity First member, meeting up with Jaron Namir in a Highland Park factory complex. Just as they were about to leave, Adam Jensen made his way to the lower levels, where he fought and killed Barrett while Namir and Fedorova escaped. When Jensen traveled to Montreal to confront Eliza Cassan, Fedorova was waiting for him in the facility that housed Eliza's AI. There, she ambushed him, but was defeated and seriously wounded, eventually succumbing to her wounds.Augmentations  Fedorova is known for her trademark leg augmentations, which not only make her taller than the average human being, but also significantly faster. Fedorova also has a stealth module, which she uses frequently throughout her fight with Jensen. She is fitted with an implant known as Claymore, a Tai Yong Medical-made replica of the Typhoon Explosive System. Fedorova's upper body is mostly covered, so it is uncertain if she has any arm or torso augmentations, but it is safe to assume that she likely has a dermal armor system, due to her health. Fedorova has no noticable head augmentations, but due to the fact that she wields two SMGs with amazing accuracy, it is presumed that an augmentation helps her with this.Trivia Tactics Faridah Malik  Faridah Malik is the chief pilot for Sarif Industries in Deus Ex: Human Revolution and the Deus Ex: Human Revolution comics. She is the protagonist of the novel Deus Ex: Fallen Angel.Biography  Faridah Malik flew V-22 Osprey cargo haulers for ArcAir, a Chinese, Triad-affiliated aviation company. She enjoyed the company of her co-pilot and best friend, Evelyn Carmichael. One day, the two were assigned to what turned out to be a smuggling operation supervised by Belltower commander Narhari Kahn. After picking up cargo from an off-shore XNG Shipping freighter, the Bel Canto, they were hit by a storm. In the turmoil, Malik discovered that the cargo were stasis pods with live humans, and witnessed Kahn executing one of the victims, a kidnapped Isolay employee who refused to submit to his new \"employers\". Parting with Evelyn, Malik fled - only to be shot down by Belltower drones on Kahn's orders. Malik survived, found a Sarif Industries business card in her wing-suit and arranged to leave her old life behind. As Sarif Industries' chief pilot, Faridah is able to fly anything from a helicopter to a VTOL, though she's only seen piloting the VTOL in-game. She is in charge of transport and delivery of Sarif Industries VIPs for any trips that require air transport. She is noted as a dedicated employee and pilot with sometimes overzealous flight tendencies that have proven her to be among the best in the skies. She has a few discreet cranial implants that enable her to be a better pilot. According to Sarif Industries Human Resources, it has been noted that a small altercation occurred between Faridah Malik and Franklin Phillips. The report notes only that Franklin was overseeing Faridah on maintenance for the company's VTOL. A verbal altercation erupted over the choppers balance levels for VTOL lift when Faridah struck Franklin. No charges were filed against Faridah and she was issued a verbal warning from Human Resources. As Sarif Industries' chief pilot, Faridah flies Adam Jensen between places and provides him with intel through Jensen's infolink. During Jensen's first visit to Hengsha, Malik seeks Jensen's help to prove the involvement of Lee Hong in the murder of her friend, Evelyn Carmichael. Upon later returning to Hengsha with Jensen, Malik is redirected to another landing zone, and is then shot down by a Belltower operative with an EMP device fired from a rocket launcher. Malik attempts to repair her crashed VTOL, as it is surrounded and under fire by a large contingent of Belltower troops. When Jensen defeats the Belltower troops to allow Malik to patch up the VTOL and take off, Malik says, \"And...thanks, Spy Boy,\" to which Jensen responds, \"Any time, Fly Girl.\"  In 2029, a cereal box in Adam Jensen's apartment in Prague contains an apparent gift from Malik to Jensen. If Jensen tries to pour himself a bowl of the cereal, a toy VTOL falls out of the box, looking just like Malik's old craft. Jensen then inspects the box inside out and sees a note taped to the bottom that says, \"Hope you like the prize inside, Spy Boy!\"Notable mission appearances Personality and traits  A hallmark of Malik's personality is her loyalty and devotion to her friends. This is demonstrated in her quest Shanghai Justice in which she is determined to find justice for her dead friend Evelyn. It is also exhibited in Deus Ex: Human Revolution in her enduring friendship with Jensen. She is arguably the person closest to Jensen throughout the game as they embark on nearly all of Jensen's missions together with her as pilot. Malik's friendship with Jensen is such that she is willing to sacrifice herself following the plane crash in the return to Hengsha so that Jensen can escape the ambush. Malik also appears to enjoy a certain latitude with Jensen that others do not, as she feels comfortable teasing him and challenging him. Malik is one of the few people that Jensen trusts completely. In the\u00a0Deus Ex: Human Revolution comics, Malik also functions as a confidante to Jensen regarding his feelings about his augmentation and his grief following the death of Katrina Sutherland. Malik encourages Jensen, quoting the \"General, Your Tank is a Powerful Vehicle\" passage from dramatist Bertolt Brecht's famous From a German War Primer to remind him that he is not a machine, and to remember to keep thinking in order to retain his humanity. Malik is one of only three known characters in Human Revolution who is unaffected by Jensen's CASIE augmentation (Social Enhancer), the others being Garvin Quinn and Michael Zelazny.Notes Trivia See also Achievements (DXHR)  Achievements or Trophies are awarded to players for completing certain tasks and accomplishments in Deus Ex: Human Revolution and its DLC The Missing Link. In the Directors Cut version of Human Revolution there are 59 attainable achievements for Xbox and Steam, and 60 for PS3. Of these, 35 are secret.Bob Page  Robert \"Bob\" Page is one of the main antagonists in the Deus Ex series. He is a wealthy industrialist, philanthropist and the founder and owner of Page Industries. He was a prominent member of the Illuminati and one of the leaders of the Illuminati's Majestic 12 division until sometime during the 2030s. At this point, he uses Majestic 12 to overthrow the Illuminati, becoming the wealthiest and most powerful man in the world.Biography Early life  Sometime prior to 2020, Page married his long term partner, a behavioral therapist, and founded his company, Page Industries. Originally, people doubted that the holding company would do well, but that changed when Page Industries acquired VersaLife, and later the patent for Neuropozyne. By the time he was 31, Page was a billionaire. During his Illuminati years, Bob Page was the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Morgan Everett, a member of the Illuminati Council of Five. Everett, who himself aspired to lead the Illuminati, groomed Page to succeed him as leader. A close relationship formed between the two, with it being likened to the relationship between a father and son. Everett mentored the younger man. Although Page was a good student, he was impatient and short-tempered. He, along with Everett, lead the Majestic 12 division of the Illuminati, which concerned itself with matters of a technological nature.2026-2027  In 2026 and 2027, Bob Page is working with other Illuminati members on a \"biochip initiative.\" Their plan is to distribute a biochip that would allow the Illuminati to control mechanically augmented people. Page participates in multiple Illuminati conferences with fellow members Hugh Darrow, Zhao Yun Ru, William Taggart, and Elizabeth DuClare to discuss the details of the biochip initiative, as well as other schemes. In one conference, Zhao and others report to Page that almost everything is in place for the biochip initiative to move forward, but Hugh Darrow reports that he is still working on finding the correct nerve interface for the biochip. However, Darrow says that he now knows where to look thanks to David Sarif. A text message then appears on the conference screen indicating that Sarif Industries researcher Megan Reed has found a gene sequence that the Illuminati \"need.\" Of concern is that Reed is about to present her discovery to the public. Reed's discovery is a genetic framework that would allow people to get augmented without the need for Neuropozyne, the drug that the mechanically augmented currently need to take to counteract Darrow Deficiency Syndrome. VersaLife, which is owned by Page, is the only company that produces this drug. The Illuminati have been utilizing VersaLife's monopoly to maintain steadfast control over augmented people through this dependency. As such, Reed's discovery would take this control away if allowed to go public. Thus, Page orders the Tyrants to attack Sarif Industries Headquarters and abduct Reed and her team before they could head to Washington, D.C. with their findings. Reed and her team are taken to the Omega Ranch, where they are put to work on the biochip control scheme at the Illuminati's behest. The biochip initiative moves forward when the Illuminati conduct a global recall of biochips, resulting in augmented people receiving new biochips constructed for the Illuminati's scheme. The biochips were intended to grant Illuminati control over augmented people. However, Hugh Darrow has other plans, and broadcasts a signal that causes augmented people who received the new biochips to go into a killing frenzy, an event known as the Aug Incident. Earlier in 2027, one of the Tyrants, Gunther Hermann, suffered severe injuries on a mission in Geneva, Switzerland, when Anna Kelso caused Gunther to crash his vehicle into the Rh\u00f4ne River. After Gunther was recovered by Majestic 12 operatives, Page opted to extensively reconstruct Gunther using cybernetic augmentations so that he could be redeployed at a later time. By the time of the Aug Incident, the Tyrants have become defunct due to the death or defection of the other members. Sometime in 2027, Zaaphire Biotech is in the business of manufacturing the drug Riezene, which is to serve as a cheaper alternative to Neuropozyne. Although Zaaphire publicly positions itself as a competitor to Neuropozyne manufacturer VersaLife, Zaaphire is in fact a proxy firm under the control of Page and the actual manufacturer of Riezene is VersaLife. Page's true agenda behind Zaaphire and Riezene is never revealed, however.After the Aug Incident  Megan, not knowing Bob Page's ties to the Illuminati and her abduction, later takes a job with one of his companies, likely VersaLife, after she was rescued from Omega Ranch. It is implied that she aids him with research relating to nanotechnology, and potentially nanotechnological augmentations. By 2029, Page has Megan working at VersaLife's San Francisco Roccasecca Beach facility on a chemical agent meant to eliminate the need for Neuropozyne in augmented people by deleting the gene that causes glial tissue buildup. However, as it is unfinished, it causes the opposite effect and ends up killing the person instead. This chemical agent becomes known as the Orchid, and would later be deployed as a poison. Sometime in 2028, Belltower Associates goes bankrupt. Page acquires G.A.R.M., a black site facility in the Swiss alps that was owned by Belltower prior to its bankruptcy. Belltower also sells its special forces division to an undisclosed buyer; the circumstances suggest that this undisclosed buyer was Page. Page and the Illuminati use G.A.R.M. to covertly house and train Shadow Operatives, a group that has inherited the role of the now-defunct Tyrants. The Shadow Operatives at G.A.R.M. operate under the direct orders of Page and refer to him as \"Mister Majestic,\" a name referencing Page's leadership role in Majestic 12.2029  In 2029, the Illuminati are working on a new initiative to control augmented people, the Human Restoration Act. If passed by the United Nations, the Act would force Augs to carry a control chip implanted in them and keep proper documents or be forced to live in segregated Aug communities. However, several voices oppose the act, including Talos Rucker, the leader of the Augmented Rights Coalition (ARC) and Nathaniel Brown, CEO of the Santeau Group, which is in the business of building safe havens for the augmented. The Illuminati's Council of Five, along with Page, hold a secret meeting to discuss plans to ensure passage of the Human Restoration Act. The group agrees to send Volkard Rand and Stanton Dowd to New York, where the United Nations will soon vote on the Act. Afterwards, Lucius DeBeers, the Illuminati leader, speaks in private with Everett and Page. DeBeers and Everett agree that Rand and Dowd might not succeed in getting the Act to pass. DeBeers therefore tells Everett that he has opted to proceed with an alternate strategy. Page tells DeBeers that everything is in place. In response, DeBeers tells Page that it is Page's chance to deliver. DeBeers then instructs Page to activate the \"sleeper cell,\" referring to a group of sleeper agents embedded in the ARC. Part of their plan is for this group, led by high-ranking ARC member Viktor Marchenko, to carry out incidents that would turn public opinion against ARC and augmented people in general, which would increase support for the passage of the Human Restoration Act. Page's sleeper cell first orchestrates the bombing of the R\u016f\u017ei\u010dka Station in Prague. Page also orders Joseph Manderley, director of Interpol's Task Force 29, to instruct his TF29 subordinate Jim Miller to implicate ARC for the train station bombing. Page is also concerned that Talos Rucker is getting close to uncovering their \"inside man\" within ARC (unnamed, but suggested to be Marchenko). Thus, Page orders Manderley to proceed with the assassination of Talos Rucker using the Orchid, even though Manderley expresses concerns that some members of the Council might not approve of such an action. The assassination is carried out by the sleeper cell under Manderley's instructions. Besides alleviating the pressure on their inside man, the assassination also allows Marchenko to become the leader of ARC. The next phase is to deal with Nathaniel Brown. Page had predicted that the death of Rucker would force Brown to rally support against the Human Restoration Act. This prediction turns turn when Brown organizes a \"Safe Harbour Convention,\" to be held at the Apex Centre in London, to persuade UN delegates vote against the Act. Page aims to have Brown and the UN delegates hosted by Brown to be killed using the Orchid, and to make it look like the work of augmented terrorists. To achieve this goal, Page deploys Marchenko to lead the Shadow Operatives stationed at G.A.R.M. to attack the Apex Centre, an operation code-named \"Stormsurge.\" Although Marchenko is useful for his connections to ARC, Page instructs the Shadow Operatives that Marchenko is fully expendable, and should be terminated by his killswitch if he deviates from the plans. Stormsurge succeeds in framing ARC as a terrorist group, but the Human Restoration Act may or may not pass, depending on whether Adam Jensen is able to prevent the assassination of Brown and the UN delegates attending the convention. After the events in London, Page and the Council of Five hold another meeting. Volkard Rand is angry that he was not informed of the actions that others put in to play, presumably referring to the actions carried out by Page as a result of DeBeer's instructions. In the meeting, Page mentions the name \"Adam Jensen\" when Everett reports that Interpol has an augmented agent working for them.Creating the Daedalus and Icarus AIs  Sometime after Adam Jensen\u2019s destruction of the Hyron Project in 2027, Page consults with Morgan Everett about the possibility of salvaging some of the wreckage for a project they are working on; namely the Morpheus initiative. Together, they create a prototype for the next generation global surveillance system, ECHELON IV. Based on their work in creating Morpheus, the prototype of ECHELON IV, Page and Everett develop Daedalus, an AI program that would help the Illuminati keep track of and control all global communications. However, although it is an AI that is capable of surveillance, Daedalus classifies its creators, the Illuminati and Majestic 12, as terrorist organizations. Thus it is necessary to modify the AI to remain loyal to Majestic 12. To this end, Icarus is created. The pair begins research into nanotechnology which leads to the creation of nanites. Nanites are used in nano-augmentations and in other more sinister technologies such as biological weapons.Page\u2019s coup  With the help of Everett, Bob Page eventually became a member of the Council of Five, the innermost circle of the Illuminati. However, as time goes on, Page grows impatient with Everett's unwillingness to use these new technologies to establish absolute control over mankind and the Illuminati's slow, gentle ways. He rebels against them by leading Majestic 12 in a coup that sees the whole of the Illuminati infrastructure being taken over by Page and his allies. The remaining members of the Council of Five are forced into hiding. They cannot communicate with each other over the internet as Page controls Icarus, the AI that spies on all internet communications. However, Page manages to track down the location of the Illuminatus Beth DuClare and subsequently has her assassinated. After the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat that catapults Majestic 12 to the forefront of world domination, Page, being the undisputed leader of the organization, becomes the most powerful person on Earth.Majestic 12  Before breaking away from the Illuminati, Page began research into nano-augmentations and searched for a person whose body would be compatible with the technology. He found a match in a boy named Paul Denton and secretly made multiple clones of the child. One of these clones grows up to be JC Denton. Paul and JC are raised as brothers by their parents, while Majestic 12 secretly oversee their lives. At some stage after the Majestic 12 coup, Page decides that the Denton parents are dispensable and orders his lieutenant Walton Simons to terminate them. He is unhappy with the free-thinking nature of Paul Denton and is concerned that he will not remain loyal to MJ12. For this reason, he wants his brother JC to be put under stricter supervision and thus sends him to a MJ12-run school in Switzerland. Here he intends to have JC indoctrinated with a sense of unswerving loyalty to his superiors. As the head of the conglomerate, Page Industries - which includes the lucrative VersaLife - Bob Page becomes a trillionaire and hence, the richest man on earth. This enables him to fund expensive projects such as the development of the internet protocol Aquinas and the Denton brothers\u2019 augmentations. According to a press release about Aquinas, the project cost almost one billion credits in total. The Aquinas protocol is used by Page to secretly monitor internet communications from the Majestic 12 base in Area 51. The cost of the Denton brothers' nano-augmentations is apparently much steeper than the cost of Aquinas, being approximately 50 billion dollars each. However, for Page, the high cost of this project is of little importance considering the level of power he hopes to garner from it. Bob Page intends to use prototype nanotechnological augmentations on others such as Paul, JC, and Walton Simons before using the perfected version on himself. As part of Majestic 12\u2019s plan to establish absolute dominion over mankind, Bob Page uses VersaLife to develop a nano-virus known as the Gray Death and the cure, called Ambrosia. By keeping the production and distribution of Ambrosia under strict control, Page can use the disease - and by extension, the cure \u2013 as a means to manipulate people into carrying out his will. One instance of this is when he coerces a US senator into making his chief lieutenant, Simons, the new director of FEMA. Page achieves this by offering to put the senator on the priority list for the Ambrosia vaccine. Even though Page is responsible for a large portion of the suffering and violence that has swept across the United States and other parts of the world, he manages to maintain a positive image in the public eye. This is due partially to his philanthropic efforts to help those in need. He announces that he intends to donate 10 million credits to the Clinics and Hospices Association of New York, to help treat those that have caught the Gray Death. In a public statement, Page comments: This is ironic considering he is both the creator of the disease and the sole controller of its cure. Additionally, the 10 million credit donation never makes it to the clinics as he has no intentions of combating the spread of the disease. Instead, he hopes to plunge the world into chaos through rioting and fear in order to promote the conditions that will allow him to create his vision of the perfect world. The production of the deadly nano-virus and its cure are only possible through the use of a Universal Constructor. Page directs Majestic 12 scientists, working at Area 51, to construct this machine with Gary Savage, a former Illuminati researcher, becoming the chief scientist. As the sinister intentions of Page become apparent to Savage and his co-workers however, a group of them abandon Majestic 12 and relocate to Vandenberg. This group, calling themselves X-51, are initially nothing but an annoyance to Page. However, with the aid of JC Denton, X-51 come very close to constructing a fully functioning Universal Constructor which they intend to use to manufacture a cure for the Gray Death. In response to this, Page orders the release of a nuclear missile to blow up Vandenberg, or to reduce it to a \u201cthin, gray smudge.\u201dApotheosis  Page plans to merge with an Artificial Intelligence in order to become something comparable to God. In order to achieve this goal, he first needs a powerful enough AI to merge with. Icarus is adequate, but Page wishes for something even greater; he hopes to combine Daedalus and Icarus to create a super AI entity. This is unwittingly carried out by JC Denton who, by giving Daedalus access to MILNET, grants Icarus the means to merge with it, leading to the creation of the combined AI, Helios.  Additionally, Page must be physically capable of merging with the AI. It becomes apparent that the ultimate goal of his research into nano-augmentations, and his efforts to perfect them, was to develop a framework that would allow this merge to take place. During the final moments of Deus Ex, Bob Page resides in Area 51 and is in the process of uniting himself with the Helios AI. This merge would grant him complete access to every piece of information on the Internet and total control over the array of UCs in Area 51. If he was to be successful he would be all-seeing, all-knowing, and all-powerful; essentially making himself a god. Ultimately, however, his plans are foiled by JC Denton, who is ironically one of Page\u2019s own creations.Notes Trivia See also Video Deus Ex: Human Revolution  Everything relating to Deus Ex: Human Revolution.JC Denton  JC Denton is the nano-augmented player character and protagonist in Deus Ex and a major character in Deus Ex: Invisible War. JC, along with his sibling\u00a0Alex Denton, is a clone of his brother Paul Denton. Initially working for UNATCO in 2052, JC's main job is to combat and stop terrorist organizations such as the NSF. He and his brother, Paul, start off as UNATCO agents having been nano-augmented and developed at Area 51. JC then switches allegiance to the NSF, stops Bob Page's conspiracy and causes the Collapse.Biography  J.C. Denton is a codename. He is revealed to be sharp, intelligent and perceptive, yet cold, stoic\u00a0and a bit of a loner. This is in contrast to his brother, who is passionate and empathetic. In an early conversation with his brother, he states that he is \"used to being on his own\" after Paul fondly remembers his UNATCO initiation ceremony. Paul then wryly remarks that \"one can be TOO self-sufficient...\". However, JC is also highly idealistic and believes his work in UNATCO to be heroic and for the greater good. JC's personality is, however, largely down to the player, as the game gives the ability to carry out whatever action he or she desires, whether it be morally reprehensible or admirable, or anywhere in between. One of the childhood heroes of J.C. Denton is Sam Carter, whom JC read about in school.Early Life  In 2028, Paul Denton's mother, who is unable to have any more children but wants another, is approached by MJ12 operatives posing as fertility experts. She is told that she will be paid handsomely in exchange for participating in experimental surgery that will allow her to become pregnant. Mrs. \"Denton\" had been poor her entire life, but now she could have another child and have enough money to raise her family in comfort. The \"fertility experts\" assure her that the surgery is minor and the risk is minimal. After the parents of Paul agree, the mother is implanted with a cloned embryo of Paul. Their lives have already been carefully monitored by MJ12 for many years. Nine months later, on March 17, 2029, JC Denton was born. In 2035, Majestic 12, displeased with Paul's progress, decided that his parents should not be allowed to raise JC. Paul and JC's parents were killed and JC was sent to Majestic 12's Swiss school, where he spent the next 12 years of his life. During this time, Majestic 12 attempted to instill in JC an unquestioning loyalty to superiors and a willingness to obey orders. Nonetheless, JC still developed a hidden rebellious attitude. In 2047 JC graduated from the Swiss school. In 2052, JC was nano-augmented and became a UNATCO agent.Birth of a Legend  In 2052, JC is a new anti-terrorist agent working for the United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition, based on Liberty Island. His first mission is to investigate an NSF terrorist attack on the island itself, and find the leader in the Statue of Liberty. After this he is sent to follow the terrorists' trail to recover stolen Ambrosia, a cure for the Gray Death virus that is plaguing the planet. Once he has found the final stolen barrel of Ambrosia, he is given the choice of killing the terrorist leader, Juan Lebedev, allowing his partner Anna Navarre to kill Lebedev, or to kill agent Navarre. Regardless of his decision, he returns to UNATCO headquarters and is sent on a mission to Hong Kong. Before leaving, he rebels against UNATCO and is captured and imprisoned in an MJ12 base beneath UNATCO headquarters. He escapes to Hong Kong to meet Tracer Tong, whom he is told can deactivate his killswitch. After uncovering a conspiracy in Hong Kong and uniting the warring Triads, JC goes to a naval shipyard to investigate ties the Illuminati may have to the global conspiracy. Stanton Dowd, owner of the ship and high-ranking Illuminatus, sends JC to Paris to meet the leader of the Illuminati, Morgan Everett. Everett sends JC to Vandenberg, where he meets and helps a group of scientists called X-51 who are trying to make their own cure for the virus. JC finally goes to Area 51, and is given three choices:Half-God  JC Denton becomes central to the plot of Deus Ex: Invisible War despite making an appearance only towards the end of the game. Invisible War takes place after JC's actions at Area 51. Due to multiple endings in the original, the developers decided to make all endings canon. After JC merges with Helios with the goal of creating the world's first true benevolent dictator, he then destroys Area 51 (it is unknown at which stage JC decided to kill Bob Page). Unfortunately, defects in JC's nanite architecture resulted in an imperfect merge. JC would be forced into stasis to wait for a cure, lest he die from the merge. JC's goal was to bring about the world's first \"post-human civilization\". By giving all humans the mental and physical advantages of biomodification, JC hoped to eliminate the stratification of humanity encouraged by the Illuminati. Additionally, biomodification would allow all human minds to communicate with the Helios A.I., which has the processing power to gauge the desires of each individual human. It would instantly respond to these desires, and thus bring about an \"instantaneous democracy\". JC intended for Helios to communicate, not to assimilate, unlike the Omar cyborg collective. However, because Helios would know each and every human thought, many of JC's enemies (such as the Illuminati and Knights Templar) feared the \"Great Advance\" would bring about universal slavery rather than universal democracy (the Illuminati believe that perfect slavery and perfect democracy are exactly the same thing). Also, many feared the complete loss of privacy the \"Great Advance\" would bring about. The merge with Helios gave JC total control over nanotechnology, transforming him into a walking Universal Constructor. He receives the power to control the weather, to alter matter on an atomic level, and to shape objects and buildings from the material he walks on. In the finale of Invisible War, JC behaves the same as every other human in combat, should the player choose to oppose him. He is tougher than any other character in the game, making him harder to kill. If Alex decides to follow JC, the closing cinematic of the game shows all of humanity uplinking with Helios, who instructs them to break down the boundaries between themselves. If Alex kills JC, and sides with either the Templar or the Omar, the Helios A.I. right before destruction revives JC. In one final attempt to prevent what JC and Helios perceive as the end of the world, JC will engage Alex and say \"You want to plunge the world into chaos? Come and take it from me\".Name Origin  The surname \"Denton\" is a reference to Warren Spector's friend, sci-fi author Bradley Denton, and the name JC stands for \"Jesus Christ\". During 2017's Game Developers Conference, Warren Spector revealed JC got his name from an anecdote where a friend, Bradley Denton, was too helpful so Spector would jokingly respond \"Jesus Christ, Denton, don't be so helpful.\" When he decided to use his friend's last name, he decided to also borrow from this saying, confirming that JC did stand for \"Jesus Christ.\"Trivia Detroit  Detroit is the hometown of, and one of the cities visited by,\u00a0Adam Jensen in Deus Ex: Human Revolution.Background  During the 1950s, Detroit was one of the world's richest cities and a beating heart of the United States\u00a0because of the thriving automobile industry. However, at some point after its golden age and before 2007, Detroit lost many of its automobile manufacturers and fell into poverty. In 2007, looking to increase the efficiency of advanced prosthetics production and wanting to rejuvenate Detroit through the mechanical augmentation industry, David Sarif purchased and overhauled an old auto factory in Detroit and converted it into the first auto-mechanical augmentation factory, giving the city new life. In 2027, Detroit is an economically segregated city. It is divided into two types of areas: the high-rise contemporary buildings of Sarif Industries and company, and the dilapidated tenements and abandoned buildings primarily under the control of the street gangs. The Downtown Apartments at Brooklyn Court is home to Chase, Greg and Josie Thorpe, Seurat, Brian Tindall, O'Malley and others. Further afield is the Chiron Building where Adam Jensen has his apartment. There is also a LIMB clinic here and a black market arms dealer in the gas station. Finally, there is the police station, the convention center and Derelict Row.Locations Missions  The following missions take place or start in the city of Detroit:Main missions (part 1) Side quests (part 1) Main Missions (Part 2) Side quests (part 2) Notes References ", "Ys Wiki": "Ys Wiki Ys Wiki To do list  Bold = Important\u00a0Ys (series)  Ys (\u30a4\u30fc\u30b9, \u012asu) is a Japanese computer and console role-playing video game series, and Nihon Falcom corporation's flagship franchise. It started on the NEC PC-8801 in 1987, created by Masaya Hashimoto (director, programmer, designer) and Tomoyoshi Miyazaki (scenario writer). In terms of the number of game releases, Ys is second only to Final Fantasy as the largest eastern role-playing game franchise. Ys is particularly popular in Japan and Korea. Ys titles have appeared on the Sharp X1, MSX2, FM-7/77, NEC PC-9801, X68000, Sega Master System, Sega Mega Drive, Sega Saturn, Famicom, Super Famicom, Nintendo DS, PC, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Playstation Vita, TurboGrafx/PC-Engine CD-ROM, cellular phone, SNES, and on the Nintendo Wii's Virtual Console service.Common elements Plot  The Ys series chronicles the adventures of Adol Christin, a young man with a zest for adventure and an uncanny knack for being in the right place at the wrong time. Gameplay usually revolves around Adol, though his comrade, Dogi, is a frequent companion in his travels. Thus far, Adol has visited the regions of Esteria, Celceta, Felghana, Xandria, the Canaan Islands, Altago , and Isle of Seiren.Gameplay  In early games, the player uses solely the directional pad to fight. The player must literally run Adol into enemies, hitting them on the side, back or slightly off-center of the front. This was created with accessibility in mind; while other RPGs at the time had either turn-based combat or a manually-activated sword, Ys had Adol automatically attack when walking into enemies off-center, furthering the accessibility concept that Falcom had in mind. While not every Ys title has used the 'bump attack' system, this has become one of the series' defining features. Falcom staff have compared this style of gameplay to the enjoyment of popping air bubble sheets, in the sense that it took the tedious task of level-grinding and turned it into something similar to a high-score-based arcade game. Ys II introduced several additions to the series. These additions include magic spells, such as shooting fireballs, and the unique ability to transform into a monster, which allows the player to both scare human non-player characters for unique dialogues as well as interact with all the monsters, many of whom often mention \"that pesky red-haired swordsman\" (referring to the protagonist Adol) to the player (when in monster form). This is a recurring highlight in the series, offering the player insight into the enemies, to an extent that very few other games allow to this day. Ys III: Wanderers from Ys adopted side-scrolling action-adventure gameplay, similar to Falcom's own Dragon Slayer series and Nintendo's Zelda II, with an attack button and a variety of different attacks. The classic control scheme returned in Ys IV: Mask of the Sun. With Ys V: Kefin, the Lost City of Sand, the game adopted a top-down viewpoint. Ys VI: The Ark of Napishtim graphically departed from its predecessors, using three-dimensional graphics and hack-and-slash gameplay.Games  The Ys series has its roots in the Japanese computer system, the NEC PC-8801. Each of the first three games was released on that platform first. Ports of the game series to console platforms have usually been handled by various other licensee companies, such as Hudson Soft, Tonkin House and Konami. The first two games in the series were originally intended as a single game, but the creators Masaya Hashimoto and Tomoyoshi Miyazaki eventually decided to split it into two separate games: Ys I: Ancient Ys Vanished (1987) and Ys II: Ancient Ys Vanished \u2013 The Final Chapter (1988). They were later re-released together as an early enhanced remake Ys I & II (1989). It was one of the first video games to use CD-ROM, which was utilized to provide enhanced graphics, animated cut scenes, a Red Book CD soundtrack, and voice acting. Its English localization was also one of the first to use voice dubbing. The Sharp X68000 remake of Ys I released in 1991 was notable for its early use of 3D pre-rendering for the boss sprites. An MS-DOS remake called Ys II Special was also released exclusively for the South Korean market in 1994; it was a mash-up of Ys II with the anime Ys II: Castle in the Heavens (1992) along with a large amount of new content. After completing Ys III (1989), Hashimoto and Miyazaki left Falcom and founded Quintet. Two particular versions of the fourth game were released, and Falcom licensed both versions out: the Super Famicom version to Tonkin House (who had handled the Super NES port for Ys III), titled Ys IV: Mask of the Sun; and the PC Engine version to Hudson Soft (who had ported all three previous games to that platform), titled Ys IV: The Dawn of Ys. Hudson Soft took certain liberties with the latter, and as a result, the two games are very different. They share the same setting, cast, and much of the basic plot, but the actual structure of the story plays out in a completely different manner, as do the game's levels and enemies. Despite being non-canonical, Hudson Soft's Ys IV: The Dawn of Ys is considered one of the best entries in the series. Mask of the Sun is the official continuation of the series. The Dawn of Ys takes several different turns, plot-wise, including some significant inconsistencies with the canonical storyline. For this reason, The Dawn of Ys is essentially an \"alternate universe\" take on the events in Celceta. A PS2 remake of Mask of the Sun was released in May 2005, further subtitled \"A New Theory\". When Falcom released Ys V, it came out on only a single platform: the Super Famicom. As a stand alone title, it was one of many late generation games that took advantage of the true abilities of the SNES, partially due to the liberties it took with the gameplay (in particular, giving Adol a jump and making him swing his sword). It was considered very easy; in response to this, Falcom soon put out Ys V Expert, a harder version of the game. A PS2 remake of Ys V by Taito was released March 30, 2006 in Japan. After this, the series sat dormant for eight years (except for remakes such as Ys Eternal), during which time Falcom abandoned console development altogether, choosing instead to focus on the Microsoft Windows platform. Out of nowhere, they announced a new game in the series, entitled Ys VI: The Ark of Napishtim, which was released on September 27, 2003. It took what Ys V had done and refined it, turning it into a very fast-paced action-RPG, which was generally well-received. In early 2005, a new title in the series was announced, this one titled Ys: The Oath in Felghana, which is a top-to-bottom \"re-imagining\" of Ys III, covering the same plot as the original, but expanding on it greatly. It could be considered a retcon, but a rather minor one, as it basically clarifies and expands on events in Ys III, rather than overwriting them entirely. In spite of how much has changed, it is not \"Ys VII.\" It was released on June 30, 2005. A spinoff game called Ys Strategy was released on March 16, 2006 in Japan for the Nintendo DS. Unlike the rest of the series, this game is a real-time strategy game instead of an action-RPG. It received lackluster reviews and general disdain from fans. Ys Origin was released in December 2006. It takes place 700 years before the events of the first game, just following the separation of Ys from Esteria. The two initial playable characters are Yunica Tovah and Hugo Fact. The two characters' stories play out somewhat differently during character interactions. Adol does not appear aside from being a hidden bonus character. Falcom has since released a new version of the game that required a copy's registration serial number sent to Falcom along with shipping charges to get an extra enhancement disc for the game. With this disc the player would be able to play as Adol, along with various other new features. Ys Seven was released in Japan during 2009 for the Sony PlayStation Portable, and was ported to PC in 2017 for North America only. It is the latest game in the canon Ys timeline chronologically, taking place about a year after Ys VI and two years after Ys VIII. This is the first entry to feature the party system, which allows the player to switch between characters that accompany Adol Christin on his journey. In order to encourage the player to utilize this system, damage types were introduced: slash, pierce, and strike, Adol always being the player's first slash damage-dealer in their party. The new party system was favorably received overall, but some fans complained about it forcing them to play as characters aside from Adol, the main protagonist. Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana was released on July 21, 2016 for Japan and September 22, 2017 for America for the Playstation 4 and Playstation Vita Console. Its stories cover Adol Christin's Diary \"Periplus of the Gaete Sea\". The latest entry of Ys Series that features a vast island to explore and additional gameplay features. It introduces the Flash Guard and Flash Move skill. Another feature is the raid battle, quest, and character event for all of the casts. The gameplay is still the same however added two new attack attribute called \"Shoot\" and \"Break\". The difference of the party system from the Ys Seven is that Adol can be removed and be placed as a reserve. Some hidden quest however will be given to players by talking into characters or by locating a place that may have a side story. The elements of the story revolves from the history Ys' and destruction of an ancient civilization. The game received great game critic scores for its good gameplay. However, its story features did not have the heavy elements seen on the Ys Seven.English releases  Until 2005, only the first three Ys games were available in North America: Ys I: Ancient Ys Vanished, Ys Book I & II, and Ys III: Wanderers from Ys. The original PC-8801, PC-9801, X1 and MSX2 versions, as well as the Famicom ports remain exclusive to Japan. English ports of the Japanese PC game Ys VI: Ark of Napishtim for the PS2 and PSP were released by Konami in 2005 and 2006 respectively, marking the first English release of the series in thirteen years. At one point, NEC Interchannel proposed bringing Digicube's Ys Eternal Story to North America, but the idea was rejected by Sony Computer Entertainment America, commonly thought to be because of their prevailing attitude toward the viability of 2D games in the North American market; but as more small profile 2D games have been released in the PS2's lifespan, the decision was more likely due to numerous technical issues with the port itself including: long load-times (even for a PS2 game), frequent lock-ups, resolution flickering during menu or screen transitions and an abnormally large save file, clocking in at 1MB (1/8 of a memory card) whereas most, and much more recent RPGs average 100\u2013200KB is size compared to a PC game. Many of these problems are associated with the game being quickly ported and released as Digicube was partially going out of business. The original Windows PC remakes were Ys Eternal and Ys II Eternal. Later, there was a compiled re-release, which bumped up Ys Eternal's visuals to Ys II Eternal's level (more color depth, primarily) and made the soundtrack sound more cohesive between the two. This was released as Ys I & II Complete. Later, once this was out of print, Falcom began selling the two separately again, as Ys I Complete and Ys II Complete. Falcom complicated the issue by changing the \"Eternal\" to \"Complete\" on all external packaging and advertisements, but not in the actual games themselves. In one of the English patches, the internal bitmaps are edited to reflect the external change for the packages. Nintendo added Ys Book I & II to the US Virtual Console Service on 25 August 2008. The Virtual Console allows owners of the Nintendo Wii to download classic games. This marks the first release of the Ys series on a 7th Generation home console. Atlus released the games in one package entitled Legacy of Ys: Books I & II on 24 February 2009 on the Nintendo DS. In May 2010, XSEED Games announced plans to localize the PlayStation Portable games Ys I & II Chronicles, Ys: The Oath in Felghana, and Ys Seven in North America. As of 2011, all games have been released.MMORPG  In 2009, Ys Online was released as an open beta for European players. The setting is centuries after Adol Christin's adventures.Animation  There are two separate OVA anime series of Ys, with the first spanning seven episodes and covering the events of the first game, and the second spanning four episodes and loosely covering the events of the second game. The first anime expands on the relatively thin storyline of Ys I including a retelling of the prologue, previously only told in text in the original Japanese manuals. Both series were released on DVD in English by Media Blasters' anime label \"AnimeWorks\". They can be purchased separately, or in a three-disc box set, entitled Ys Legacy. The dubbed/audio tracks have changes to some character names (\"Dark Fact\" becoming \"Dark Factor\", \"Adol\" becoming \"Adle\", and \"Lilia\" becoming \"Lillian,\" for instance). Pronunciations of various names are inconsistent, sometimes within the same scene. Included on one of the discs is what appears to be a preview for an anime based around Ys IV. This was created by Falcom as a \"pitch\" trailer to shop around to various animation studios, to see if anyone was interested in producing the series. They had no takers, however, so this trailer is all that exists of the rumored Ys IV anime.Music  The Ys series is particularly known for its original music soundtracks by Yuzo Koshiro, Mieko Ishikawa and Hideya Nagata. The composers' works have been remixed for each subsequent release of Ys I and II, most memorably by Japanese computer musician Ryo Yonemitsu for Hudson Soft's Ys I & II and Ys III: Wanderers from Ys releases for the PC Engine CD-ROM. Combining Yuzo's composition and Ryo's arrangement abilities, this arrangement found itself introducing video gamers, for the first time, to video game soundtracks that can stand on their own as full orchestral pieces of music. The TurboGrafx versions are also notable for their very early use of Red Book audio in video games. The Ys soundtracks are today regarded as some of the best video game music ever composed. Consequently, the Ys series is seen in the video game music industry as some of the finest and most influential role-playing video game scores of all time, demonstrated by an extensive series of CDs based on the series' music, with numerous variations on its themes. The only other series with similar impact on the video game music industry at the time were Dragon Quest and Falcom's own Dragon Slayer action RPGs (also composed by Yuzo Koshiro and Mieko Ishikawa).Ys world External links Ys Origin  Ys Origin (\u30a4\u30fc\u30b9\u30fb\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30f3) is an action role-playing game developed and published by the Japanese company Nihon Falcom for Microsoft Windows in 2006. In 2012 XSEED Games published an English-language localization of the game, via the Steam platform. Ys Origin is a prequel to the six previous installations of the Ys video game series. It takes place 700 years before the events of Ys I: Ancient Ys Vanished, and tells much of the backstory of Ys, Darm Tower, the Black Pearl, the twin goddesses, and the six priests. The game has three playable characters: Yunica Tovah, Hugo Fact, and Toal Fact. By completing the game with each of the characters, the player sees more dimensions to the story. Each player character has a distinctive story, combat style and skillset. Ys Origin is the first game in the Ys series in which Adol Christin is not present.Ys I: Ancient Ys Vanished ~ Omen  Ys: Ancient Ys Vanished ~ Omen (\u30a4\u30fc\u30b9I \u5931\u308f\u308c\u3057\u53e4\u4ee3\u738b\u56fd \u5e8f\u7ae0, \u012asu 1: Ushinawareshi Kodai \u014ckoku Jokyoku) is an action role-playing game developed by Nihon Falcom Corporation in 1987. The name is commonly misspelt \"Y's\" due to an error on the packaging of the English release of the Master System port. This is the first installment of the Ys series. Initially developed for the PC-8801 by Masaya Hashimoto (director, programmer, designer) and Tomoyoshi Miyazaki (scenario writer), the game was soon ported to the Sharp X1|X1, PC-9801, FM-7/FM-77, FM-7AV and MSX2 Japanese computer systems. Ys saw many subsequent releases, such as English-language versions for the Sega Master System, MS-DOS, Apple IIGS, and TurboGrafx-16, and enhanced remakes for the Sega Saturn and Microsoft Windows systems. It is frequently rereleased alongside the immediate sequel, Ys II; they are even treated as a single game, referred to as Ancient Ys Vanished. Some of these releases: Ys Book I & II for the PC Engine CD; Ys I & II Eternal (Story)/Complete/Chronicle for Windows PCs, PlayStation 2, and PlayStation Portable; and Legacy of Ys: Book I & II for the Nintendo DS.Plot  The hero of Ys is an adventurous young swordsman named Adol Christin. As the story begins, he has just arrived at the Town of Minea, in the land of Esteria. He is called upon by Sara, a fortuneteller, who tells him of a great evil that is sweeping the land. Adol is informed that he must seek out the six Books of Ys. These books contain the history of the ancient land of Ys, and will give him the knowledge he needs to defeat the evil forces. Sara gives Adol a crystal for identification and instructs him to find her aunt in Zepik Village, who holds the key to retrieving one of the Books. With that, his quest begins.Gameplay  The player controls Adol on a game field viewed from a top-down perspective. As he travels on the main field and explores dungeons, he will encounter numerous roaming enemies, which he must battle in order to progress. Combat in Ys is rather different from other RPGs at the time, which either had turn-based battles or a manually-activated sword. Ys instead features a battle system where Adol automatically attacks when walking into enemies off-center. When the protagonist moves toward his enemy, damage is sustained on both sides. Attacking straight on causes the attacker the most damage to himself, but clipping the edge of the defender yields a successful differential. This combat system was created with accessibility in mind. This 'bump attack' system has become one of the series' defining features. Falcom staff have compared this style of gameplay to the enjoyment of popping air bubble sheets, in the sense that it took the tedious task of level-grinding and turned it into something similar to a high-score-based arcade game. Another feature that has been used in nearly every Ys title since the original is the recharging health mechanic, which had previously only been used in the Hydlide series.Version differences  Aside from graphical differences, the game layout remains essentially the same across the many ports of Ys; however, there are some versions where the details were changed. The Sega Master System version, for example, saw some of the game's dungeon areas flipped horizontally (including some other minor differences). The most distinctive of the early ports was the Family Computer edition, which was published by Victor Musical Industries. This version was a vast departure from the original, featuring entirely new layouts for the towns, field, and dungeons, replacement of a number of the original musical tracks, and a new final battle sequence. The version developed for the MSX contained a handful of new musical tracks which replaced part of the original game's soundtrack. Some of these tracks, along with a number of unused tracks first composed for the original, were later incorporated into the soundtracks of certain later releases such as Ys Eternal and Ys Complete. The versions developed for the PC Engine CD-ROM, released as Ys I & II in 1989, and Sega Saturn included additional cutscenes, such as an opening detailing Adol's arrival in the town of Minea. The Sharp X68000 enhanced remake released in 1991 was notable for its early use of 3D pre-rendering for the boss sprites. However, this ended up creating what is considered \"a bizarre contrast\" with the game's mostly 2D graphics. The Microsoft Windows-based remakes, Ys Eternal and its various updates, Ys Complete and Ys Chronicles, is a full-fledged remake in every area. It introduced an entirely different look and feel, such as the ability to run and attack in eight directions instead of the original's four. It greatly expanded the setting with dialogue, cutscenes, and even additional gameplay areas. Complete features a different soundtrack from Eternal made to match the soundtrack of Ys II Eternal, while the much later Chronicle update features new soundtracks for both games. The Nintendo DS received a conversion and revamp of Ys Complete called Legacy of Ys: Books I & II, which was released in late March of 2008 in Japan and late February of 2009 in North America. Interchannel helped develop the game. Atlus published and localized the game for its western release. The first bunch of copies released came in a cardboard box containing the game's DS game case as well as a special bonus CD that contained higher-quality versions of 30 music pieces from the game's newly-arranged soundtrack-- 13 pieces from Ys I, 16 from Ys II, and one from both (being Open Your Heart). The opening cutscenes from the Ys Eternal version are used. The game received a near-perfect translation with very little errors (the most infamous being Solomon translated as \"Salmon\"). The gameplay was tweaked considerably, allowing access for many crowds. Both games are available to play right from the start. Artwork from the Complete version is used. The game's world is in 3D with characters, bosses, and attack effects being 2D sprites. Difficulty settings Very Easy, Easy, Normal, and Nightmare are included for both games as well as a Music Player mode (where you can listen to the MIDI-based OST of the game) and Time Attack mode (where you try to beat every boss as fast as possible), the latter two being unlocked upon completion of their respective games (beating Ys I will not unlock Time Attack and Music Player for Ys II and vice versa). Controls were revamped as well, being three different options: Ys I received a new dungeon exclusive to this version-- Vageaux Vardette, the mazelike crater forest that Ys used to lay upon. The boss of this dungeon is Petrorex. Vageaux Vardette is explored immediately after the Shrine of Solomon is completed-- Adol can find a new set of equipment here, consisting of the Defender (a sword), Mithril Mail (armor), and the Ruby Shield. Ys II received a new, exclusive multiplayer mode that 2-4 people can take part in, each requiring their own copy of the game. Little information exists on this mode. Reception was mostly positive, with most complaints being about either the \"3D graphics looking bland\", the \"slight drop in difficulty\", or the \"mediocre music\". Most people who have bought it consider it to be \"a must-have for any DS owner\".Music  Composed by Yuzo Koshiro along with Mieko Ishikawa, the soundtrack is notable for its rich melodies in an age when video game music was beginning to progress from monotonous bleeps. This soundtrack is considered to have some of the best video game music ever composed, and it is considered one of the finest and most influential role-playing video game scores of all time. Several soundtrack albums dedicated to the music of Ys have been released by Falcom. These include:External links  Ys I & II ChroniclesYs VI: The Ark of Napishtim  Ys VI: The Ark of Napishtim (\u30a4\u30fc\u30b9VI -\u30ca\u30d4\u30b7\u30e5\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u5323-, \u012asu 6: Napishutemu no Hako) is a Japanese action RPG developed and published by Falcom, and the sixth installment in the Ys series. It was first released in 2003 for Microsoft Windows-based personal computers. Not counting the Eternal/Complete remakes of Ys I & II, it was the first new Ys game released by Falcom in eight years. Ys was ported to the PlayStation 2 in 2005 and to the PlayStation Portable in 2006 by Konami for worldwide release. It was notable for being the first English release of the series since Ys III: Wanderers from Ys. In 2015, an English translation of the Windows version was announced for release on April 28th via Steam, the Humble Store and GOG.com (source)Plot  The story begins after Adol's ship is attacked by a fleet of Romun ships. Forced to sail into an unknown area, they encounter a large storm. Adol is swept off the vessel while trying to rescue a fellow sailor and washed ashore by the vortex that surrounds the Canaan Islands. He is found, unconscious, by the nieces of the chieftain of the nearby Rehda village, Olha and Isha, who are the daughters of his brother who died when battling with fellow Redha against the Wandering Calamity. The girls take him to their village and lay him to rest in their Uncle Ord's house. Adol hears them talking about him and wakes up briefly, afterwards going back to sleep because of his exhaustion. His adventure then begins.Releases PC (Japanese)  The initial release of the game was the \"Limited Edition\". After this sold out, Falcom released a standard edition of the game with some new features. Two new difficulties and a Time Attack mini-game where you fight through all the game's bosses were added. However, there was never a patch or upgrade released to initial buyers, so players wanting these new features had to buy the game again. Years later, Falcom released the \"PC Vista version\", which is the same as the Standard Edition with support for Windows Vista.PlayStation 2  Konami made several additions and changes when porting the game to the PlayStation 2. The most notable were the inclusion of both English and Japanese voice acting to all characters (including NPCs) and several new optional areas referred to as \"Alma's Trials.\" While the Japanese voice acting could be selected in the NTSC-U version, the PAL version had all Japanese voice acting removed. Konami also added new FMV sequences, though the original animated sequences could still be selected through a code. Blood and gore effects were removed due to console games requiring a rating. Lastly, they changed the character and monster graphics from pre-rendered 3D sprites to fully polygonal 3D models. While this allowed for much better animation, it also changed Adol's appearance based on his equipment.PlayStation Portable  The PlayStation Portable port does not include any of the changes of the PS2 port except for the removal of blood and gore effects. However, the European and North American versions came with a new set of bonuses including some extra fetch-quests that unlock a few mini-games and an image/media gallery. These were later included in a \"Special Edition\" re-release in Japan. However, the game is noted for having particularly long and frequent load times. Voice-acting was never included in this version.PC (Steam)  In 2015, XSEED games ported the original Japanese PC version of the game to Steam in English. Therefore, Konami's additions, such as voice acting, 3D models and Alma's Trials, are not included. However, the resolution was improved for HD support. They also changed the functionality of the Wing of Alma to let you warp to previously visited areas at any point in time, with a few exceptions.Ys: The Oath in Felghana  Ys: The Oath in Felghana (\u30a4\u30fc\u30b9 -\u30d5\u30a7\u30eb\u30ac\u30ca\u306e\u8a93\u3044-, \u012asu: Ferugana no Chikai) is a modern remake of Ys III: Wanderers from Ys. While the original game is a 2D platformer, the new game is a 3D game with platformer features.Plot  As in Ys III, Adol Christin and his friend Dogi are traveling to Dogi's hometown of Redmont, in Felghana, three years after the events of the first two games. Upon arriving, they discover that evil happenings are threatening the townspeople, and it is up to Adol to put a stop to it. The basic plot has been slightly modified from the original, and expanded through the use of additional scenes.Gameplay  The game-play follows the new model from the previous game, The Ark of Napishtim, with several improvements. Many things from the previous game were streamlined to keep the focus on the action as opposed to equipment and item management. For example, healing item and stat bonuses are no longer carried as items or accessories; instead, these bonuses are dropped from defeated enemies and are used upon pickup along with an experience bonus for attack combos. These bonuses are maintained through constant combat.External links Ys VI: The Ark of Napishtim/Characters  This is a list of all the character in Ys VI: The Ark of Napishtim.Adol Christin  Adol Christin (\u30a2\u30c9\u30eb\u30fb\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3), erroneously known as Aron in the Master System version of Ys I, is the main protagonist of the Ys series. He is an adventurer and a swordsman who has a knack for arriving at the right place at the wrong time. Despite being a silent protagonist throughout the entire series, he is shown to be the type of person who can never leave those in trouble and will try to help him or her in any way he can. Known to many as a master swordsman, he also carries the nickname \"Adol the Red\" due to his fiery-red hair; a rather unique trait among those he visits during his travels, thus earning him that title. Being a man of adventure and of few words, he never stays in the same place for long and always expresses himself through motivation and his will to fight and help those in need.History  Not much is known about Adol's past, except that he was born in a small nameless mountain village, thought to be somewhere in the Garman region of Europa (around present-day Germany, presumably in the regions near the real-world Black Forest). Adol came from a humble background, born to a peasant family, but still managed to live a normal daily life. It's shown in the intro of Ys I that sometime in his childhood, he was taught the basics of swordsmanship by his father, a skill that he excelled in and made his own. Sometime later, an elderly traveling merchant came to his village. His stories of far off lands captured Adol's imagination early on. Between this, and his father's bedtime stories of dragon-slaying heroes, Adol decided to one day become an adventurer. He continued to dream of far-off lands, and when he was 16, left his home village to begin his own adventures. The first destination he had in mind was the largely unexplored continent of Afroca. However, fate threw a spanner into his plans. While resting in a tavern halfway to Promalock, Adol overheard local merchants talking. He learned that war had broken out between the Mercantile Kingdom of Altago and the Romun Empire. Having absolutely no desire to be caught in the middle of a war, he made an abrupt change of plans and headed west instead. Upon the arrival at the port town of Promalock, he heard about the island of Esteria. Once a peaceful hub of trade, a veil of storms suddenly appeared out of nowhere, cutting off all shipping. Rumors were starting to spread that Esteria had become overrun by monsters. This motivated Adol to go to the island of Esteria to investigate. After working some odd jobs to obtain a ship of his own, Adol set out on a small boat for Esteria on a clear day. However, the weather changed when he hit the Stormveil, and he was shipwrecked on the shores of Esteria. This shipwreck started his first real adventure that would go on to reveal what happened to the ancient kingdom of Ys. After the first adventure in Esteria, Adol would go to Celceta in the following year. There, he meets Eldeel, the last of the mythical Eldeen civilization. Even though Eldeel offers Adol the knowledge of the world, Adol refuses, instead seeking to explore the world for himself. Thus, it is at this point that Adol would start calling himself an adventurer and get recognized by the world as such. Adol would go onto many adventures, bringing hope and revelation to wherever he visited. Many of his adventures would be related to the Eldeen civilization but not all of them as some, like the Five Dragons of Altago, would be completely unrelated to the Eldeen civilization. Some time past his fifties, Adol went back to his village and started making records of his adventures. At one point, he tried to reach the north pole but failed. He is said to have disappeared or died at the age of 65. Even a long time after his death, the records of his adventures motivated many people to start exploring the world, giving rise to the Age of Discovery.In Games Ys I: Ancient Ys Vanished  As the story of his adventures in Esteria begins, Adol drifted ashore, unconscious, in the Land of Esteria due to the Stormwall. He is found on the Whitefoam Sands beach, and is saved by a young man named Slaff. Slaff took Adol to the Clinic in the Port Town of Barbado for care. Adol later wakes up in the clinic and introduces himself to Dr. Bludo, the owner of the clinic, and finds out that Slaff is in fact his son. After several days of resting, Adol fully recovered from his injuries, and thus his adventure began. When Adol reached the Town of Minea, he is called upon by Sara Tovah, a fortuneteller who rather bluntly states that Adol is the one that she's been looking for. After telling Adol of a great evil that is sweeping the land. Sara informs him that he must seek out the six Books of Ys, each book named for one of the six priests that governed Ys: Hadal, Dabby, Tovah, Messa, Gemma, and Fact. These books contain the history of the ancient land of Ys, and will give him the knowledge he needs to defeat the evil forces. Sara gives Adol a Crystal for identification and instructs him to find her aunt Jeba in Zepik Village, who holds the key to retrieving one of the Books. With that, his quest begins. On the way out of town, Adol also meets a mysterious poet named Reah, who is searching for her missing Silver Harmonica. Adol journeyed to Zepik Village and showed Jeba the Crystal that he received from Sara. Jeba gave him the Shrine Key, and Adol set out to Solomon Shrine to search for the Book. Inside the Shrine, Adol faced a dangerous wizard named Jenocres, and after defeating him, met a young amnesiac woman named Feena imprisoned in a dank prison cell. Adol swore that he'll bring Feena out of the cell. Pausing his quest for the Book, he escorted her back to Zepik Village; upon arrival, Feena collapsed with a fever. Fortunately, they were near Jeba's house. Adol lent his back and brought her to Jeba's house. After that, Adol headed out to the Solomon Shrine again to find the Book. While searching for the book, Adol found a few useful Items (a Treasure Box Key, which Adol presumably kept on his person ever since, and the Mask of Eyes particularly), as well as the keys needed to enter the Shrine's Depths: the Ivory Key and the Marble Key. Entering the deepest part of the Shrine, Adol discovered the Book, guarded by a monster named Nygtilger. After defeating Nygtilger and recovering the Volume Hadal, Adol headed back to Minea, to show the book to Sara. Sadly, misfortune befell Sara as she was murdered by a \"man in a black cape\". One of the Town Elders, in her stead, gave Adol the 2nd Book of Ys, Volume Tovah, and hints of what is next, Adol heads into the Abandoned Mine, inside he found the Silver Harmonica which belongs to Reah, the Roda Tree's Seed ( a seed that allows him to converse with the Roda Tree, which prompted him for obtaining the Silver Sword), and the 3rd Book of Ys, Volume Dabbie, that is guarded by Vagullion. Afterwards Adol returned the Silver Harmonica to Reah, and let Jeba read the books for him. She told Adol that there are 3 Books remaining, and the three of them are located in Darm Tower, and to go there he need to ask her son Goban. He did so and entered the Darm Tower; before he entered, Goban warned him that Adol is limited for one day inside and couldn't go back again before the time limit. He also told him that his follower Dogi are still trapped inside the Tower. Inside the Darm Tower, Adol climbed it floor by floor fighting hoards of monsters. On the sixth floor, Adol then ran into a trap which knocked him out. When he came to, he was in a cell with another man named Luta Gemma. Adol also noticed all his Silver Equipment was gone. Adol looked for a way to escape the cell, but lacked any means to escape. Suddenly, the cell wall was destroyed by none other then Dogi (this was Adol's first meeting with Dogi). Dogi then helps Adol escape and gave him a idol to give to an old man named Raba. Adol then continues exploring Darm tower and runs into this old man who`s goes by professor Raba. Raba has been studying various lores and is knowledgeable about Ys. After a brief conversation, Adol trades the statue for a Blue Necklace which allows him to pass though various traps within Darm Tower unharmed. Adol then continues exploring the tower and now with the ability to travel though the traps unharmed is able get higher up in the tower and find his Silver Sword as well as his Silver Shield. Soon afterwords Adol ends up squaring off against a gigantic monster known as Pictimos, whom Adol defeats and collects a 4th Book of Ys (Volume Gemma) from as well as a hammer. As he climbs higher up into the Tower, he manages to defeat another gigantic monster known as Khonsclard and obtains the 5th Book of Ys (Volume Messa). Adol eventually arrives at the maze of mirrors. He retrieves his Silver Armor and learns from Raba that a young girl is trapped in the section of the tower called Rado's Annex. Adol proceeds to go there and finds that the girl trapped in Rado's Annex is none other than Reah the poet. Reah reveals to Adol that the man responsible for her kidnapping and monsters' appearance in Esteria is none other than Dark Fact. She also tells that Dark Fact's cloak is made of the special metal called Cleria so unless Adol uses the equipment made of Cleria, Adol would have no chance of defeating Dark Fact. Lastly, she gives him a Monocle, which allows Adol to read the Books of Ys. Finding out from the book that he needs the blue amulet in order to get to the top of the tower, he goes back to find Luta. Luta reveals that he is a descendent of the priest Gemma and gives him the Blue Amulet. Adol manages to go through various mazes filled with monsters and defeats a pair of gigantic demons called Yogleks & Omulgun. Reaching the top of the tower, Adol finally meets Dark Fact, a descendant of the Priest Cain Fact (the traitor among the Six Priests who fell from grace and became an evil demon), the man responsible for the disasters that befell Esteria. Dark Fact congratulates Adol in arriving at the top of the tower with the Books of Ys but tells Adol that he has no idea about the power contained in those books and that he will have to die in order for Dark Fact's plan to go to the ancient land of Ys to succeed. With no further words, the unrelenting battle between Dark Fact and Adol ensues. After the grueling battle, Adol comes out the victor. He finds the final Book of Ys, Volume Fact, in Dark Fact's cloak. With all six Books of Ys gathered, the books begin to glow and gather around Adol. Suddenly, Adol finds himself getting shot upwards. He starts losing consciousness as he approaches a floating island in the sky...Ys II: Ancient Ys Vanished \u2013 The Final Chapter  After achieving victory over Dark Fact, Adol is transported to the floating island of Ys. He is found by a young woman named Lilia, who takes him to her home in Lance Village. After recuperating and learning he is indeed in Ys, Adol purchases some basic equipment and heads into the Moondoria Ruins. While in the Ruins, Adol stumbles across a statue of the Twin Goddesses of Ys. Approaching it with a certain wooden staff in hand, the Goddesses speak to him and grant him the power of magic. As he journeys into the Noble Sanctuary of Toal, Adol finds the Tombs of the Six Priests of Ys. Each Book of Ys is returned to its Priest, who impart wisdom to Adol. Adol soon learns that Rance's village physician, Dr. Flair, has gone missing. Adol entered the dangerous, monster-infested Rasteenie Mine (which, according to his own diaries, is connected to the mine of the same name on the surface below), and rescues Dr. Flair with a Mattock he finds along the way. Dr. Flair informs Adol that Lilia is very ill, and will soon die without medicine. He begs Adol to find a Celceta Flower and Roda Nut to create the medicine. While searching for the ingredients, Adol finds two ornate magic staffs: the Fire Magic (Priest Tovah's power), and the Light Magic (Priest Dabbie's power). On the second level of the mine, Adol faces one of the demons terrorizing Ys: Velagunder. After slaying the demon and completing the medicine, Adol returned to Lance. Lilia's mother Banoa was eternally grateful to Adol for saving her daughter, gifting him the Return Magic passed down from Priest Hadal. Adol cleared the monsters from Zirah's basement, returned the final Book of Ys, and then left the village, bound for the Solomon Shrine at the very summit of Ys. First, Adol had to cross the massive Ice Ridge of Noltia. Adol found many useful items while scaling it (such as the Stone Shoes, Spirit Cape, Hawk Idol, and Transform Magic (Priest Gemma's power). Upon summiting the glacier, Adol faces off against another demon: Tyalmath. Adol defeated it easily, and moved along to the Moat of Burnedbless. Burnedbless turned out to be one of the most difficult legs of Adol's journey, as his progress was blocked by a passage filled with toxic volcanic gases. Backtracking into a hidden area, Adol stumbled onto the Roos' Nest, home to the surviving population of Ys' sacred animals. There Adol found a Roda Leaf, which he used as a filter to breathe in the toxic atmosphere. After making his way to Colony of Lava, Adol learned that the bridgeman Ruba's son, Tarf, had been kidnapped by the demons. Adol vowed to save him, gaining the Whisper Earrings as a gift. Adol succeeded in rescuing Tarf, and escorted him home. After making his way to the exit of Burnedbless, Adol confronted a third demon: Gelaldy. Adol succeeded in defeating it, and entered Ramia Village. After upgrading his equipment, Adol met Gort Dabbie, the guard to the gate leading to Solomon Shrine. After being directed to old man Hadat, and being given a Lila Shell to communicate, Adol transforms into a Roo, and using his own equipment as \"proof\" of his \"death\", is granted entrance to the demons' stronghold. Adol navigates about the vast Shrine, stumbling across many useful treasures (such as the Silver Pendant, the Sacred Cup, and the Time Magic (Priestess Messa's power)) in the process. Using his Transform Magic, Adol not only learns the password to access other parts of the Shrine, but overhears the demons in a meeting. After making his way through half the Shrine, Adol attempts to enter the Subterranean Canal. His progress, however, is blocked by the wizard Dalles, second in command of the demons besieging Ys. After offering clemency to Adol, he places a powerful transformative curse on him that only Holy Water can cure. Fortunately, Adol had already recovered the Sacred Cup. Returning to Ramia Village, Adol sought out Elder Reggs, and used his well to draw water into the Sacred Cup. Drinking the Holy Water, the curse was lifted, and Adol resumed his journey into the labyrinthine Subterranean Canal. Adol found the escaped villagers in a corner of the Canal, including Lilia, who gifted Adol the Shrine's Master Key. Dalles, however, had used Adol to find the runaways, and cast a powerful petrification curse on them. For the first time in his life, Adol was angered to the point of desiring revenge. Adol returned to the center of the Shrine and confronted the demon spider Druegar, cutting him down easily. Touching the Goddess Statue behind him, Adol entered the Shrine's Inner Sanctum. Adol's explorations of the central sectors revealed more treasure (namely the Battle Shield). Here, Adol met a friendly demon named Keith, who was once a human until he was cursed by a powerful demon. Keith gave Adol the Floodgate Key, so he could access more of the Canals. After draining the water, Adol explored and recovered two more powerful pieces of equipment: the Battle Armor and Battle Sword. Decked out from head to toe in gold-plated armor, Adol continued to storm the Canals, and found the Falcon Idol (the upgraded Hawk Idol). Adol soon left the Canals and entered the West Wing, making his way to the Goddesses' Palace. Finally face to face with the twin Goddesses of Ys, Adol found their looks and voices to be vaguely familiar to him. The Goddesses instructed Adol to retrieve the Dreaming Idol to break the petrification curse, and directed him to the Campanile of Lane. The minute he entered the Campanile, Adol faced off against the third-in-command of the demons, Zava. After defeating her, Adol met Maria Messa, the latest prisoner to be sacrificed. Despite Maria's warnings, Adol was determined to stop the sacrifices. He scaled the Campanile, recovering the Dreaming Idol in the process. As Adol reached the summit of the Campanile, he found Dalles was the one tolling the bell. After explaining to an astonished Adol that the Priests' descendants still lived, and that the sacrifices were meant to eradicate them, Dalles rings the final bell, signalling Maria's death. Returning dejected to the Goddesses, Adol presented the Dreaming Idol, only to find it had a missing eye. The Black Pearl was once part of its eyes, and Adol was sent to retrieve it. After scouring the Shrine, Adol recovered it and set it in the empty socket. During his travels about the Shrine, Adol noticed the clouds were getting closer. Once atop the Campanile, Adol held the Idol aloft, and its bright glow shattered Dalles' curse. Meeting up with Bohtz, Adol was given the Golden Pendant as a thank you. He also met the young man Sada, who gave Adol his family's Cleria Sword, stating he would need it more than Sada did. Adol also received the Cleria Armor from a grateful Hadat. Adol finally noticed the ground approaching, and as Ys settled into the Bagyu Ba'dead crater, realized that Ys had descended to the surface below. Realizing that evil was going to win, Adol took to the Canals, and entered the Underpass of Ys, where he confronted Dalles for the final time. The battle was fierce, but Adol's new Cleria equipment gave him an edge over the wizard. Vanquishing Dalles, Adol entered the Core of Ancient Ys, finding the Shield Magic (Priest Cain Fact's power). Adol finally reached the center of Ys, where he found the Goddesses imprisoned! The ancient Demon King, Darm, had awoken from a 700-year-long slumber, and sought to once again conquer the world. Before he could, Goban and Luta arrived to aid Adol. Goban gave Adol the Silver Harmonica, and Luta gave Adol his family's Cleria Shield. Armed with these, Adol played the harmonica, awakening the Goddesses. To his shock, the Goddesses were revealed to be Feena and Reah. The twin sisters blessed Adol's sword with their full divine power, and armed with the Goddess' Ring given to him by Lilia, Adol set out to destroy Darm. Entering the core of Ys, Adol found Darm to be a powerful adversary. Drawing on all his strength, Adol fought the Demon King with all he had, and succeeded in shattering the Black Pearl containing Darm's consciousness. As the ancient gemstone crumbled to dust, all the magic of Ys left Adol, forever destroyed along with the Black Pearl. Afterwards, Adol was congratulated heartily by all his friends, who left one by one. Feena revealed to Adol that the Goddesses would need to seal themselves away, to prevent the Black Pearl from ever being misused by anyone again. With tears in her eyes, she begged Adol to remember her not as a Goddess, but as the girl he knew. She never had the courage to confess her feelings to him, and left with Reah shortly after. Even after the Goddesses sealed away the Black Pearl, Dogi met up with Adol again, and after enjoying the celebrations in Lance and Minea, Adol set out with Dr. Flair and Dogi for the port town of Promalock, bound for the southern land of Celceta.Ys: Memories of Celceta  Adol starts off alone in Celceta, wandering around the Town of Casnan with no recollection as to who he is. In the bar, he meets Duren, an information broker who seems to recognize Adol. Adol is telling Duren of his plight when the miner bursts into the bar and says that some miners are trapped due to appearance of monsters. Adol, with the help of Duren, manages to rescue the miners. This act of heroism draws the attention of Vicereine Griselda, who commissions Adol to explore and make the map of Celceta. Duren uses this as an opportunity to strike up a partnership with Adol, stating that they can explore Celceta and search for Adol's lost memories in the process. Seeing as there is no other option, Adol accepts. The following day, the duo decide to set two destinations, the giant tree and the large river, and start their adventure.Ys: The Oath in Felghana  One year after his adventures in Celceta, Adol and Dogi have begun traveling together. Passing through a town, they find a gypsy caravan and Dogi goads Adol into having his fortune told. Upon gazing at Adol, the fortune teller's crystal ball explodes. The fortune teller utters one word: \"GALBALAN!\", and mentions Felghana. On the spur of the moment, both Adol and Dogi decide to go to Dogi's hometown of Redmont. Shortly after landing on the shores of Felghana, the pair chance upon a shattered ancient monument. While Dogi examines it, they both hear a scream, and Adol bolts off ahead of Dogi. Adol discovers a group of wolf-like monsters that are cornering a young woman. Being the heroic sort that he is, Adol attacks them, saving the young woman. Dogi happens to catch up shortly after the incident, and discovers the young woman, who instantly recognizes Dogi on sight. She is revealed to be Dogi's childhood friend, Elena Stoddart. Upon arriving in the Trading City of Redmont, they learn that the townspeople are being threatened by men from nearby Valestein Castle. Always ready for adventure, Adol decides to assume the task of helping them out. After a commotion in the town square, Adol learns that the town Mayor, Edgar, is trapped in to Tigray Quarry. Adol volunteers to spearhead a single-handed rescue. While there, Adol discovers that there has been a cave in, and monsters have taken over the quarry. Adol travels deep inside the quarry to rescue Edgar, encountering a mysterious sorcerer named Dularn (AKA \"The Creeping Shadow\") in the process. After defeating Dularn, Adol finds an artifact called the Ignis Bracelet, that gives him the ability to shoot fireballs. Adol penetrates deeper, and encounters the boss of the Quarry: The Azure Queen of Death, Ellefale. After her defeat, Adol receives a strange idol called the Moonstar Statue. Shortly after exiting the Boss' chambers, Adol finds a young knight threatening Edgar. Adol decides to intervene, and it is revealed the knight is in fact Chester Stoddart, Elena's older brother. After a sharp rebuke from Chester, Adol pulls Edgar back out to the entrance of the quarry and goes back to Redmont. Meeting Elena again, Adol learns more about Chester from her, and that the feudal lord of Felghana, Count McGuire, is seeking four statues, much like the one Adol found. The town priest, Father Jean Pierre, went to the Illburns Ruins to investigate another statue potentially being found there. The town's nun, Sister Nell, requests that Adol rescue the Father. Traversing the ruins, Adol gets to an altar of sorts, where he overhears Chester talking with Pierre. After Chester discovers him, Adol realizes that there is no way to talk sense into Chester, and both men draw their blades. Surprisingly, Chester proves to be Adol's equal in skill, easily defeating him. Losing the duel, Adol is caught, and tells Chester that Elena is worried about him. With Lord McGuire watching, Chester rebuffs Adol and kicks him down into a pit of lava. Battling through monsters, Adol finds a fire dragon, Guilen, and defeats him. The reward, the Ventus Bracelet, helps Adol to glide after double jumping. After escaping from the pit, he stumbles upon a large bridge, and fights the monstrous Lord of the Blazing Prison, Gyalva, claiming the Sunset Statue. Upon coming back to the town, Adol meets up with Dogi, who informs him that he is heading off to the Eldarm Mountains to meet his Master, Berhardt. Adol meets with Edgar, who informs him that men from Valestein Castle are actively seeking the statues. He informs Adol of a mural found deep in Tigray Quarry. Adol approaches the mural and a voice enters his head as he touches the ancient Mission Tablet: the voice of the heroic Eldeen, Genos. He tells of the ancient demon Galbalan, an Ash Emelas creation of the Clan of Darkness. Roughly 3000 years ago, Galbalan broke from his creators' control after gaining sentience and went on a rampage. Genos was sent by the Eldeen to slay the beast. Though he succeeded in defeating the demon, Genos could not kill Galbalan and was instead forced to seal him using the four statues. As Adol left the mine, he encountered the The Crystalline Entity, Isterisiva. The fight was tough, but Adol managed to defeat it and claim the Darkness Statue. Adol then departs for the Eldarm Mountains to chat with Dogi's Master. Adol travels up the mountain to the peak and defeats Ligaty, a trio of harpies summoned by Dularn, removing the last obstacle blocking the way to Berhardt's cabin. Adol finds Dogi chatting with Berhardt in his home. After Dogi and Adol are separated by a recent cave-in, Dogi tosses Adol the Terra Bracelet. Entering the Icebound Cave, deep in the mountains, Adol encounters Gildias, Guardian of the Icy Depths. The brutally intense battle nets Adol the Light Statue, with all four now in his possession. Chester reveals himself, trying to force Adol to hand the status over. Fortunately, Dogi decides to step in, leading Chester to stab Dogi in rage. A horrified Adol is forced to exchange the statues for Dogi's life. Dogi is taken to Berhardt's cabin to recuperate, and Adol heads back to town, only to find zombified soldiers attacking the townsfolk. Adol defeats them, and learns that Valestein attacked Redmont after the statues were placed somewhere in the castle. Adol, suspecting something is off about the attack, departs to storm Valestein Castle. Adol doesn't even bother trying to sneak in, and storms right through the front gate, finding the castle full of zombified soldiers and maids. Realizing something more sinister than Chester had planned is afoot, Adol fights through the castle to find that Elizabetha, Alice and Christof, Count McGuire's wife and children (whom Adol had the opportunity to meet earlier) are safe. Urging them to evacuate to Redmont, he fights his way to the dungeons and finds several townspeople, including Elena, held captive. Along the way he faces three terrifyingly powerful opponents: Death Faleon, The Ever-Whirling Assassin (one of McGuire's hired thugs); Zellfel Zam Schultiger, The Savage Mongrel (a wild creature native to Garman that fell victim to the zombie mist); and Zirduros, The Clockwork Cannon (the guard of the Valestein dungeon). After reaching the Clock Tower, Adol scales the massive machine and makes his way to the roof, where he finds Chester holding McGuire at swordpoint, about to kill him. Adol draws his blade, knowing that Chester will not tolerate interference. Surprisingly, Chester now wields two swords: his own, and the very weapon used by Genos to seal Galbalan: the Brave Sword. The two lock blades for the second and final time, in what Adol later recounted as the single most intense sword duel of his life, barely emerging victorious. Count McGuire uses the opportunity to flee to the roof of the keep, where Chester corners him. Just as the fatal blow is about to be struck, Elena begs him to stop. Chester barely relents, as McGuire reveals he was but a pawn in the larger scheme of Bishop Nikolas Garland, the true mastermind behind the disasters in Felghana...all in an effort to revive Galbalan. Chester draws his blade, but Garland strikes him down easily, telling him that even Adol is no match for his new powers. Adol knows the only way to stop Galbalan's revival is to go to Genos Island himself. Dogi, still gravely injured, volunteers to ferry Adol there. Before departing, Chester hands him the Brave Sword, telling him to use it against Galbalan in his stead. On landing, Dogi's injuries opened up, and he was forced to rest. On entering the Genos ruins, Dularn was revealed to be Sister Nell. A fierce fight ensued, with Nell's wound proving fatal. She revealed she was in love with Garland, and served him out of both loyalty and implied sexual attraction. After acquiring Raval Armor and a Raval Shield, Adol confronts and kills Garland in single combat, before descending into the core of the island to meet Galbalan. The demon proves to be one of the toughest opponents Adol has ever faced in his life, pressing his every skill to its limit. Though he manages to criticially wound Galbalan, it begins to regenerate. Chester then offers himself as a sacrifice, knowing the only way to destroy Galbalan for good is to self-destruct Genos Island. He tells Adol to take care of Elena for him, before sacrificing himself to destroy the island. The island then disappears for good. Shortly after, Dogi decides to stay in Felghana for a time and help rebuild, so Adol departs solo for parts unknown. He would not see Dogi again until after his adventures in Xandria. An interesting prophecy at the end of the revamped version of Ys III (JP) for PS2 is revealed when Adol chooses to talk to an old woman as he's saying goodbye to everyone before leaving. Her words, loosely translated were: \"You are the one who will bring together everyone's happiness in all your travels around the world.\"Ys V: Kefin, The Lost City of Sand'  Adol continued his adventures, traveling through new lands to the South in Afroca (which resembles historical Africa). Hearing of the vanished desert city of Kefin, he set out to investigate this ancient city's disappearance. Arriving in the city of Xandria, he is accosted by local soldiers. Their captain, Rizze, quickly relieves her guard. While resting at the local pub, he learns of the mysterious \"Phantom City\". Not minutes after learning of this, he is summoned by Xandria's most powerful merchant, Dorman. Dorman requests Adol recover six mysterious crystals, a task once attempted by the Xandrian adventurer Stein. Adol departs for Foresta Village, where he learns of a local legend stating a \"red haired swordsman\" is an omen of disaster. During his investigations, he meets a young girl named Niena, and a mysterious wizard named Stoker. Along the way, Adol learns more about the Phantom City and its connection to the collapsed kingdom of Kefin. While collecting the Water Crystal, Adol becomes acquainted with the \"thieves of brotherhood\", the Ibur Gang, who attempt to obstruct Adol repeatedly at Dorman's instructions. As he progresses in his quest, however, Adol also begins to realize that opening the path to the Phantom City may not be as beneficial as it first seems. After collecting the last of the crystals, however, Niena is kidnapped by Dorman and Rizze. Pursuing them to a hidden island, Dorman reveals two facts: that the Phantom City is in fact Kefin, and his intention to use Kefin's alchemy for his own ends. Not about to let hidden powers be misused, Adol engages Dorman in a titanic battle that pits alchemy against alchemy. Adol manages to defeat the merchant but the real mastermind turns out to be Rizze, Dorman's partner. A shocking truth is then made plain: Rizze is in fact Crown Princess regnant of Kefin. Rizze reveals that the ancient city of Kefin was sealed 500 years ago by the alchemists when the city's leaders attempted to conquer the world with Kefin's alchemy. Holding Niena hostage, she takes all the crystals from Adol and breaks the seal on Kefin, causing the ancient city to appear once again and accelerate the desertification of Xandria. In order to rescue Niena and prevent Kefin from destroying rest of the world, Adol travels to Kefin. Unlike the legend, Kefin turns out to be a fake paradise where its citizens are sacrificed periodically to power the Philosopher's Stone, the source of Kefin's alchemy. Unfortunately, the Ibur Gang, along with Niena, are caught by Kefin's soldiers and get locked up in prison. Once Adol finds out, he joins the Partisans, the resistance that opposes Kefin's oppressive regime. As Adol rushes to her rescue, Niena regains her memories; she was in fact a denizen of Kefin, and an alchemist herself. It is also revealed they are about to be sacrificed by Rizze in the ritual to maintain the power of the Philosopher's Stone. With the Partisans' help, Adol manages to evacuate all the innocent citizens of Kefin to the outside world and defeats Jabir, the alchemist who was controlling Kefin from shadows with the Philosopher's Stone. It was a tough fight but he succeeded. After Jabir's defeat, Adol shatters the Philosopher's Stone to prevent its misuse ever again. The destruction of the Philosopher's Stone causes Kefin to disappear and Adol and his allies, along with the citizens of Kefin, manage to escape from Kefin successfully. As Adol prepares to leave Xandria in search of a new adventure, he runs into Niena one last time. Although Niena wants him to stay in Xandria, she knows that there are many people out there who need Adol's help, just as she once did. She bids him farewell after telling him that she will look forward to the day when he visits Xandria again. Even as he left, Terra screamed he better wait up for her. Adol, however, simply wanted to continue his journey.Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana  Adol and Dogi have boarded the passenger ship Lombardia crossing the Gaete Sea to reach Eresia. They pass the Isle of Seiren, an island said to be cursed as every ship trying to reach it yet has sunk, the Lombardia is attacked by a giant sea monster. Despite his efforts to defeat the monster, the ship is destroyed and Adol is washed ashore on the Isle of Seiren. Adol finds other survivors on the island, Laxia von Roswell, a Garman noble woman and Captain Barbaros, the Lombardia's captain who begins establishing a base camp called Castaway Village. Adol and Laxia are tasked with the search for other survivors and exploration and mapping of Seiren Island. They soon encounter the Greshun fisherman Sahad Nautilus, who is fleeing from a giant beast called Avalodragil. With united efforts the three of them manage to drive the monster away, unable to actually harm it, and Sahad joins Adols party. The three of them explore the island and manage to find more castaways, Dogi among others, who join Castaway Village and defend it from monster attacks while trying to find a way off the island. Adol starts experiencing strange dreams of a woman called Dana from an unknown civilization. They encounter a mysterious person called Hummel Trabaldo, who calls himself a transporter and roams the island on his own and periodically joins Adols party if their goals happen to align. One day, Captain Barbaros is attacked by a person calling themselves Nemo, Romun language for Nameless. Euron, a Romun military officer explains he boarded the Lombardia in order to catch a Romun serial killer known as the Nameless Ripper. After searching the village for clues, Euron and Adols party begin to suspect the villages doctor, Kiergaard. Once confronted, Kiergaard reveals himself to be the Nameless Ripper but escapes. While pursuing him, Captain Barbaros walks into one of Nameless' steelwire traps which inflicts a fatal wound. Adol and his party catch up with Nameless and fight him until the Avalodragil turns up again and kills Nameless. Captain Barbaros asks Adol to get everyone off the island safely before succumbing to his wounds. Laxia reveals her theory that the Avalodragil and other beasts they encountered are types of Primordials, ancient beings believed to be long extinct by researchers like her father. While they are climbing the great mountain range named Gendarme Mountain spanning across the Island, they meet Ricotta, a young girl native to the island, who owns darts made from Orichalcum which are able to damage Primordials unlike normal weaponry. She joins Adols party to look for her father on the northern half of the island. They manage to obtain Orichalcum to equip themselves to fight against Primordials. Once they reach the top of Gendarme Mountain, they are surprised to see ruins of an ancient civilization on the northern part of Seiren Island. At this point Hummel rejoins Adols party permanently. Meanwhile Adols dreams of Dana become increasingly mysterious as the tree saplings Dana plants in the dreams turn into fully grown trees that open paths for Adol to advance towards the ruins. In front of the giant Tree of Origins near the ancient ruins, Adol finds Dana in a deep sleep. She was the Maiden of the Great Tree of the Kingdom of Eternia which was the flourishing civilization that built those ruins long ago. She joins Adol as she is missing most of her memories and tries to figure out what happened to her people. Adol and his party are able to view fragments of her past using crystals found all over the island. The castaways are starting to worry about a ghost ship which was repeatedly seen along the coasts near Castaway Village. Adols party begins to investigate and finds out that it was the Eleftheria, the Ship of the feared pirate Captain Reed. Adol manages to lay his troubled spirit to rest and obtained a chart of the sea around Seiren Isle, which allows them to escape the island once they finish their ship and defeat the sea monster that sunk the Lombardia, which they found out is a Primordial called Oceanus. They manage to lure it into a trap and Adolfs party finishes it off. Dana regains more of her memories as they view the fragments of her past with the crystals. The Kingdom of Eternia was destroyed by a meteor shower and its meteorological consequences. Dana encounters a group of mysterious individuals calling themselves Wardens of Evolution. The number of Primordials and their attacks on Castaway Village is continuously growing, and they seem to be coming from the Great Tree of Origins. As they investigate the tree, Adols party learns of Great Trees purpose: to foster Evolution in the world by periodically wiping out all but one species with a great cataclysm called Lacrimosa. The meteor shower that wiped out the Kingdom of Eternia was but one such Lacrimosa, and the Primordials overrunning the world was to be the next. Adol was to become the Warden of Evolution of his era, the one brightest soul of his time which would become immortal and observe the process of evolution. Adol refuses to accept this however, and fights against this fate, even though the other Wardens tell him of the futility of his actions. The Wardens tell him how he may be able to stop the Lacrimosa with the power of the Tree of Psyches found inside Seren Garden, which collects the psyches of all beings since the last Lacrimosa. He manages to free the psyches of the previous eras, which lets the Tree of Psyches grow enough to grant him the power he needs by turning his sword into Mistilteinn. He enters the Selection Sphere inside the great Tree to fight the Providence of Evolution, Theos de Endrogram. Defeating it destroys the world and awakens the Earth Goddess Maia, who reconstructs the whole world. The Great Tree of Origin is no more and instead Dana has offered herself to become the Goddess of Evolution and oversee the process of Evolution herself, together with the other Wardens. Dana now only exists as a concept and within the memories of Adol and his party. Adol returns to Castaway Village. A week later all the preparations are done and the castaways leave the Isle of Seiren to return to their daily lives. After parting from the other castaways, he stayed in Greek for a while before continuing westwards.Ys VI: The Ark of Napishtim  Adol, once again ends up unconscious in a shore due to being caught in the Great Vortex of Canaan. However, he was saved and nursed back to health by the Rehda Priestess, Olha, and her younger sister Isha. The villagers in their village are awkward to Adol since they don't really trust Eresians (The Rehda's term of calling human foreigners) very much. Once again fate intervenes, as he is thrust into a battle over the Ark of Napishtim, a powerful weather-control device left behind by the ancient Eldeen civilization. Even after facing down Romun Commander Ernst (himself a member of the Clan of Darkness, the same clan whom Adol has encountered in previous adventures, and native of Danan Village in Celceta), the Ark's Control Key shattered, causing Napishtim to spiral out of control and attempt to send a tidal wave to wipe out the shoreline of Europe. Adol is forced to shut down the core of Napishtim, which causes the whole Ark to self-destruct. It is only with the intervention of Alma and the ancestral spirits of the Rehdan priestesses that Adol is saved.Ys Seven  He is the fated Dragon Warrior, and he is the only one who has ever stopped the Rite of Destruction. A master swordsman, he yields swords that are abundantly bought and forged throughout the whole country of Altago. In combat, he can wield three types of swords: a Slash type that deals extra damage to soft enemies; a Strike type heavy sword that deals extra damage to armored enemies; and Pierce type swords effective against flying opponents. Throughout the game, he cannot be switched out of the party as he is the Party leader and will encounter more allies and people in the land of Altago. Dogi jokes that Adol is unlucky with boats and that he always ends up in trouble while seeking out adventures.Abilities  Despite having a reputation for wielding ancient mystical powers at various times in his life, Adol does not have any innate magical power of his own. All magical abilities that he gains during his adventures come from magical artifacts (i.e. the Ignis, Ventus and Terra Bracelets in \"The Oath in Felghana\", the Emelas Swords in \"Ys VI\"), or were bestowed upon him by powerful mystical entities (The Six Priests of Ys, the Five Great Dragons of Altago). However, Adol demonstrates a nearly impeccable mastery in the utilization of these abilities. Nevertheless, Adol's main strengths are his near-superhuman endurance, and master-level swordsmanship. This is best demonstrated in Ys I: Ancient Ys Vanished where he goes through Darm Tower, a place filled with ferocious monsters, treacherous traps, and ancient demons, and reaches the top within one day. Due to his adventures, Adol is adept at crowd control, proving to be very proficient at dealing with large groups of enemies at once. As the series goes on, his swordsmanship improves significantly. In \"Ys: The Oath in Felghana\" (itself a remake of \"Ys III: Wanderers from Ys\"), he defeats Chester Stoddart, a Felghanan knight who is a master swordsman in his own right, twice in a duel. In \"Ys VI: The Ark of Napishtim\", he manages to critically weaken the Ash Emelas creature Demi-Galba, which can only be destroyed by weapons made of Emelas, with only a steel sword (his steel Long Sword then snaps, presumably from three years of use). Then in Ys Seven, he slays a gigantic beast in the coliseum, despite having gone through days of torture, and being given bare-bones equipment to defend himself with. He then proceeds to be the only Dragon Warrior ever to prevent the Rite of Destruction. Adol's skills, combined with his unwavering determination, have helped him overcome any obstacles in his way, earning him fame as a great adventurer and master swordsman.Gallery  Adol Image GalleryTrivia External link  Adol Christin on the Heroes wiki.Ys II: Ancient Ys Vanished \u2013 The Final Chapter  Ys II: Ancient Ys Vanished - The Final Chapter (\u30a4\u30fc\u30b9II \u5931\u308f\u308c\u3057\u53e4\u4ee3\u738b\u56fd \u6700\u7d42\u7ae0, \u012asu Ts\u016b: Ushinawareshi Kodai \u014ckoku Saish\u016bsh\u014d) is an action role-playing game developed and published by the Nihon Falcom Corporation, and first released on June 24, 1988 for the NEC PC-8801. It is the sequel to Ys I: Ancient Ys Vanished, and takes place immediately following the end of the first game. It was released along with its predecessor as part of the enhanced compilation, Ys I & II, for the TurboGrafx-CD in 1989. It was later adapted into the anime Ys II: Castle in the Heavens (1992).Versions  Like its predecessor, Ys II was ported to various other platforms following its first release, such as the NEC PC-9801, Sharp X1, FM-7, MSX 2, and Famicom. It was also remade for the TurboGrafx-CD by Hudson Soft as part of Ys I & II; for many years this was the only version of Ys II that received an official English release. An MS-DOS remake called Ys II Special, developed by Mantra, was released exclusively for the South Korean market in 1994. It was a mash-up of Ys II with the anime Ys II: Castle in the Heavens (1992) along with a large amount of new content, including more secrets than any other version of the game. The game was a success in Korea, despite competition from the Korean RPG Astonishia Story that same year. Years later, a third remake was released for Microsoft Windows-based PCs as Ys II Eternal, and later as Ys II Complete. Versions of the game have also been developed for mobile phone platforms. Ys II was most recently remade for the Nintendo DS. An English translation of this version was released by Atlus in North America, along with the DS version of Ys I on a single card, as Legacy of Ys: Books I & II in 2009.Plot  Ys II picks up immediately where Ys I left off. Adol Christin is transported to the floating island of Ys, where he meets a young woman named Lilia. She takes Adol to her home, Lance Village. It is here that he will begin his quest to unravel the secrets of Ys, and finally rid it and Esteria of evil.Gameplay  The player controls Adol as he battles his way across the land of Ys. As in the first game, Adol's strength is measured in a typical RPG fashion: He has numerical statistics such as HP, Attack Power, and Defense Power that determine his strength. These stats are increased by raising his experience level through battling. Also returning from the first game is the 'bump' combat system. The player attacks enemies by running into them, and the enemy takes damage according to Adol's Attack Power. A new addition to Ys II is the Magic system: Adol can acquire several different spells he can use throughout the course of play, such as a Fire spell for attack, and a Time spell which can stop enemies as long as it is active. The use of magic consumes Adol's MP stat.Music  The soundtrack to Ys II was composed by Yuzo Koshiro, Mieko Ishikawa (\u77f3\u5ddd\u4e09\u6075\u5b50), and Hideya Nagata. Several music CDs dedicated to the music of Ys II have been released by Falcom. They include:OVA  Those of OVA been re-built on the story of the game version also exists.

Guardian of the Moonstar Statue.Ys Legacy  Ys Legacy consists of two different OVA series. The first series is based on the first Ys game, Ys I: Ancient Ys Vanished. The second is based on the Ys game, Ys II: Ancient Ys Vanished \u2013 The Final Chapter. Ys I and II (video game) are often called BOOK ONE and BOOK TWO respectively. Not to be confused with the naming conventions of the games they were based on, the first animated series was split into two parts: BOOK ONE covers episodes 1-4 while BOOK TWO covers episodes 5-7. Since BOOK TWO refers to the second half of the Ys I series, the Ys II anime was named Castle in the Heavens.Availability  Both series are available on DVD in English, having been released by MediaWorks. They can be purchased separately, or in the three-disc box set, Ys Legacy. The English releases are the subject of some contention, since the dubbed audio track has multiple and frequent changes to the music and character names (\"Dark Fact\" changed to \"Dark Factor\" and \"Lilia\" changed to \"Lillian,\" for instance), and pronunciations of various names are inconsistent, sometimes within the same scene. Included on one of the discs is what appears to be a preview for an anime based around Ys IV: The Dawn of Ys. This was created by Falcom as a \"pitch\" trailer to shop around to various animation studios, to see if anyone was interested in producing the series. They had no takers, however, so this trailer is all that exists of the series.Olha  Olha (\u30aa\u30eb\u30cf) is the reigning priestess of the Rehda tribe that live on Quatera Island. She expects her sister Isha to succeed her one day. She is adept with a longbow, and skilled at playing her flute.Geis  Geis (\u30ac\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5) is a mercenary and recurring character in Ys series that first appeared in Ys VI: The Ark of Napishtim alongside his brother Ernst. He later returns in Ys Seven to serve as one of Adol's allies and acts as his rival. He wields a jet-black poleaxe with frightening skill, manipulates talismans for sorcery and commands alchemically-created fairies inherited from his brother Ernst. He is endlessly critical of Adol and the two of them are often at odds with one another, but ultimately respects his ability and strengths, and reluctantly counts him among his allies.History  Before the events of Ys VI: The Ark of Napishtim, it is revealed in Ys: Memories of Celceta that Geis is originally from the village of Danan where many members of the Clan of Darkness reside. When\u00a0Ernst\u00a0and\u00a0Gruda left the village in search of power, Geis\u00a0pursued them in hopes of stopping them before they follow their ancestors' course of action and cause major damage to the world. According to Ys Seven, Geis went to the Kingdom of Altago to look for seal arts so he can defeat Ernst. Geis came across Ciarius who taught Geis the seal arts he desired. However, the deal required Geis to return the favor someday when he goes back to Altago.In Games Ys VI: The Ark of Napishtim  He encounters Adol when the latter is exploring the Mythos Path. He then challenges Adol to a duel to test their skills, and Adol agrees. After the duel, he tells Adol to not interfere with local affairs. Later, he places talismans on some pillars in the Zemeth Sanctum and tells Adol not to remove them. Later, Adol walks in on an argument between Geis and Ord. When the Great Vortex is temporarily dissipated, Geis discovers that the talismans were removed and blames Adol for removing them, only to have Raba explain to him that the culprits responsible for removing the talismans are Baslam and his workers. After Adol defeated Lanaluna, Agares and his troops cornered Adol and Olha who Agares held hostage intending to enslave. Geis kills them and rescues Adol and Olha from this situation. Geis later shows up in the Ruined City of Kishgal, and is cleared along with Adol to go into the Ark of Napishtim. They split. Geis then fought Ernst and lost while Adol defeated Galba-Roa, the original Galbalan. Adol then found Geis, and Geis asked Adol to defeat his brother. Adol and Geis escape the Ark of Napishtim after Adol was forced to destroy it.Ys Seven  He is a playable party member.Trivia Ys VI: The Ark of Napishtim/Equipment & Items Ys Seven  Ys Seven (\u30a4\u30fc\u30b9\u30bb\u30d6\u30f3) is the seventh Installment in the series, following the adventures of Adol Christin.Storyline  Following the events of Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana, Adol and Dogi reached the Capital of Altago in an attempt to find more adventure. While exploring the town, they get into trouble trying to save two sisters who were being harassed by the local Dragon Knights, which is the army force of Altago. They are thrown into the cells but thanks to their reputation as adventurers, they get a request from the king to help him investigate some strange earthquakes going on lately, as his men have not been able to find anything. On their way, they find out the Five Dragons are awakening once again to prevent a great evil, lending their power to Adol to help stop it.Gameplay  In previous Ys titles, players had to switch between elemental weapons to damage monsters and bosses. Not much is different this time around, except players change party members and use different attacks. The two other members are controlled by the AI while in combat and it is possible to set how they attack. During Battle, the player will get 4 skills for his set that depletes meter.\u00a0Reception  The game received generally positive reviews. Ryan Clements from IGN has praised the game's skill and battle system, calling it \"unlike any JRPG I've played in recent memory. Even more surprising are the game's boss encounters, which require extreme focus to beat.\" He also noted that the music is \"very enjoyable\" and that, while the story is simple, the sincerity \"keeps it from being boring\". Still, he criticized the need to backtrack to the dungeons and the \"modest\" graphics.\u00a0Brittany Vincent of Popzara lauded the game's combination of action and storyline, calling it \"an acceptable gateway drug into the expansive game world that several RPG fanatics are already well entrenched in.\"More about Ys Seven Ys IV: The Dawn of Ys  Ys IV: The Dawn of Ys (\u30a4\u30fc\u30b9\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc \u30b6\u30c9\u30fc\u30f3\u30aa\u30d6\u30a4\u30fc\u30b9, \u012asu 4: Za D\u014dn Obu \u012asu) is an action role-playing game developed for the PC Engine Super CD-ROM, and is the fourth game in the Ys video game series. Ys series creators Nihon Falcom Corporation licensed its development to Hudson Soft. The Dawn of Ys was released in 1993 and was one of two games released under the title of \"Ys IV\", the other being Tonkin House's Ys IV: Mask of the Sun for the Super Famicom. The two games share the same setting, but Hudson took more liberties with its presentation in The Dawn of Ys, and two unique games resulted.Plot  Ys IV takes place two years after the events of Ys II, and before the events of Ys III: Wanderers from Ys. As the game begins, Adol has returned to the town of Minea, where Ys I began. After hanging around for a while and conversing with old friends, he decides to set sail for the overseas land of Celceta.Gameplay  Ys IV returns to the style of play used in Ys I and II. The gameplay area is viewed from a top-down perspective, and the player attacks enemies by running into them to cause damage. Adol gains experience from defeating enemies, and gaining experience serves to raise his strength, as in the previous games. The Magic system introduced in Ys II is also brought back for this game.Music  The original music was composed by Falcom's Sound Team JDK; however, there are no track-by-track credits as there had been for previous Ys titles. As was the case with Hudson's CD-ROM\u00b2 versions of Ys I & II and Ys III: Wanderers from Ys, The Dawn of Ys CD-DA tracks were arranged by Ryo Yonemitsu. Yonemitsu did not arrange the entire soundtrack for the game itself, as many tracks were programmed for the console's internal sound chip by Keita Hoshi, but he did cover every track for the Perfect Collection Ys IV CD series. (see below) Soundtrack releases for Ys IV: The Dawn of Ys are as follows: In addition, Falcom's Falcom Special Box '95 contained the Ys IV J.D.K. Special Vol. 2, a collection of tracks left off the first J.D.K. Special, along with a number of \"lost tracks\" never used in the game.External links Ys III: Wanderers from Ys  Ys III: Wanderers from Ys (\u30a4\u30fc\u30b9III -\u30ef\u30f3\u30c0\u30e9\u30fc\u30ba\u30d5\u30ed\u30e0\u30a4\u30fc\u30b9-, \u012asu 3: Wandar\u0101zu furomu \u012asu) is an action role-playing game developed by Nihon Falcom Corporation. It is the third game in the Ys (series). Ys III was initially released for the NEC PC-8801 and NEC PC-9801 in 1989, and versions for the MSX 2 and Sharp X68000 soon followed. In 1991, a number of console ports were produced: versions for the TurboGrafx-CD, Famicom, Super NES, and Sega Mega Drive/Genesis. A port for the PlayStation 2 was released by Taito Corporation in 2005. The TurboGrafx-CD, Super NES, and Genesis versions, as well as the PSP and Windows version of the remake, Ys: The Oath in Felghana, have received official English-translated releases. In addition, the NES and MSX 2 versions have been fan-translated.Plot  The opening scene informs the player that it has been three years since the events of Ys I and Ys II. Adol Christin and his friend Dogi are on a journey. Passing through a town, they find a gypsy caravan and Dogi has his fortune told. The fortune teller's crystal ball explodes and both Adol and Dogi decide to go to Dogi's hometown of Redmont. On the way to Redmont, the pair chance upon a wildcat that attacks them, saving Dogi's childhood friend, Elena Stoddart, in the process. Upon arriving, they learn that the townspeople are being threatened by men from nearby Valestein Castle. Always ready for adventure, Adol decides to assume the task of helping them out. Travelling to Tigray Quarry, Adol discovers that there has been a cave in, and monsters have taken over the quarry. Adol travels deep inside the quarry to rescue Edgar, the mayor of Redmont. After defeating the boss of the Quarry, Ellefale, and claiming the first statue, Adol finds Chester (brother of Elena) threatening Edgar. Adol pulls Edgar back out to the entrance of the quarry and goes back to Redmont. Meeting Elena (formally this time), Adol learns that some statues are being sought by Lord MacGuire, the King of Felghana province (where the game takes place). Another statue is being sought in the Illburns Ruins, so Adol travels there to retrieve it. Another townsperson, Father Pierre, has gone there as well. Adol gets to an altar of sorts, where he overhears Chester talking with Pierre. After a brief duel with Chester, Adol is caught, and tells Chester that Elena is worried about him. With Lord MacGuire watching, Chester rebuffs Adol and kicks him down into a pit of lava. Battling through monsters, Adol finds a fire dragon, Gilan, and defeats him. The reward gets Adol over a large river of lava by solidifying it. After escaping from the pit, Elena meets Adol at the top of a staircase. She informs him that the statue is indeed hidden further on. He opens a hidden door and fights a Wyvern, claiming the second statue. Upon coming back to the town, Adol meets up with Dogi, who informs him that he is heading off to the mountains and that Edgar wishes to see Adol. Adol meets with Edgar, who informs him that men from Valestein (Ballacetine in the SNES version) Castle are actively seeking the statues. He informs Adol of a statue in Tigray Quarry. Adol proceeds to the quarry and defeats the monster guarding the third statue. Adol then heads back to Redmont to inform Edgar. Upon arriving at Edgar's house, he interrupts a conversation between Edgar, Lord MacGuire and Bishop Garland (no relation to Final Fantasy I's Garland) about Galbalan. Galbalan, according to Edgar, is a demon of tremendous power who used to rule over the populous of Felghana a long time ago. He was sealed away (not destroyed) by a hero (depicted on a slab of stone Adol finds in the quarry) using the four statues. Adol is sent to the Elderm Mountains to chat with the hermit living there. Adol finds Dogi chatting with the Master up on the mountain. The Master tells Adol that a statue is indeed in the mountains, but inaccessible due to a statue that guards the entrance. Adol travels up the mountain to the peak and defeats a Harpy, gaining the staff that opens the way to the statue. He defeats the guardian Dragon, and claims the fourth and final statue. Chester show up, and tries to force Adol to hand over the four statues. A cave in interrupts the conversation, and Dogi digs the two men out. Chester is reunited with Dogi, and they converse briefly. Adol and Dogi leave for town, and find it almost deserted, with Mr. Gardner (the town guard) nowhere to be found. Inside the walls, they find Mr. Gardner and some of the townsfolk. Apparently, while Adol and Dogi were in the mountains, soldiers from Valestein Castle came to the town and kidnapped townsfolk in exchange for the statues. Adol converses with Edgar before setting out for the castle. At Valestein Castle, Adol fights his way down to the dungeons where he finds the townspeople and Father Pierre (who had been moved here after Illburns Ruins). He tells Pierre to get the people out of the castle, and goes to find Lord MacGuire. On the way to Lord MacGuire's chambers, he comes across Bishop Garland, who taunts Adol. Garland then reveals himself, and Adol defeats him after a lengthy battle. Upon reaching Lord MacGuire, Adol finds that Lord MacGuire is repentant, and is sorry for his actions. He will make reparations for his actions. As Adol goes back across a bridge, he is met by Elena, who congratulates him on beating the soldiers and being a hero. Galbalan (who has reawoken due to the seal of the statues being broken) kidnaps Elena in midair and taunts Adol, telling him to bring the statues to his island fortress. Adol goes back to town, doubting himself. Edgar and Dogi bring Adol back to his senses, and Adol sets off to rescue Elena. Surviving many challenges, Adol comes to a platform where Elena and Chester are talking to each other. Galbalan taunts Chester just as Adol arrives. Adol promises the statues to Galbalan, if he will not harm Chester or Elena. Galbalan agrees, and pulls Adol up to his realm. Adol fights and defeats Galbalan, and rescues Elena. Adol finds out that Chester has gone to the very center of Galbalan's Island, to seal it away. Elena tells Adol that her village and its people are descendants of the man who sealed away Galbalan the first time. Only Chester knows how to sink Galbalan's island, and Adol must not interfere. Adol understands and he and Elena leave the sinking island. The scene shifts to Chester, who is manipulating crystals to sink the island for good. He tells Adol to take care of Elena for him, before sacrificing himself to destroy the island. The island then disappears for good. Back in Redmont, Adol and Dogi are at the Inn getting ready to leave. Dogi tells Adol to go on ahead, as he has something to take care of. They are leaving in the early morning as to not cause a stir within the community. Dogi is chatting with Elena, who is in love with Adol. Dogi leaves, and Elena almost stays. She then walks out of the Inn. Mr. Gardner is asking Adol what he and Dogi are planning. Mr. Gardner would like Adol and Dogi to stay, but Adol wants to have more adventures. He and Dogi leave, and as they are walking along the shore, Elena runs up and shouts to them. Both Dogi and Adol wave goodbye. Elena cries as text scrolls telling about further adventures waiting for Adol and Dogi. (plot from SNES version of the game)Gameplay  The perspective of Ys III is a sharp departure from the previous two games. Instead of the previously used top-down camera view, Ys III uses a side-scrolling platformer presentation. Auto-attack is removed; the player must push a button to make Adol attack enemies. As in previous entries, however, neither the player character nor the enemies have temporary invincibility. Otherwise, the gameplay mechanics are identical to previous entries in the series. The statistics, equipment, shopping, experience system, and magic all function the same as in Ys I and II (though spells are represented by rings instead of wand icons, and MP is renamed \"Ring Power\").Music  The soundtrack to the original version of Ys III was almost entirely composed by Mieko Ishikawa, with several contributions from Yuzo Koshiro. The Sharp X68000 version of the game introduced a number of additional compositions, which were composed by Masaaki Kawai. Falcom has released a number of music CDs dedicated to the music of Ys III. They include: To commemorate the release of the Ys III remake The Oath in Felghana in 2005 (see below), Falcom released Ys Premium Music CD Box in Felghana, a boxed set of all Ys III music CDs produced.Ys: The Oath in Felghana  In 2005, Falcom released Ys: The Oath in Felghana for Microsoft Windows, a remake of Ys III. The Oath in Felghana slightly modifies and greatly expands on the story of the original Ys III, and expands the dungeons to extend the gameplay time. The original side-scroller was also replaced with a 3D game engine, based on that used in Ys: The Ark of Napishtim. In 2010, Falcom released a version of Ys: The Oath in Felghana for the PlayStation Portable, which Xseed Games officially released in English later the same year. This was followed in 2012 by a newly localized version of the original 2005 PC release, sold on Steam and GOG.com.Master-system-ys-the-vanished-omens-box-front.jpg ", "Yu-Gi-Oh! Wiki": "Yu-Gi-Oh! Wiki ", "MFG Yu-Gi-Oh! RPG Wiki": "MFG Yu-Gi-Oh! RPG Wiki Egyptian God Cards  The Egyptian God Cards, also known in Japan as the Three Phantom Gods, (\u4e09\u5e7b\u795e, Sangenshin), are a series of cards in Yu-Gi-Oh! that serve as a focal point in the series' manga, the second series anime, and numerous video games.History  The Egyptian gods are one-of-a-kind all-powerful cards created by Maximillion Pegasus, who modeled them after three Ancient Egypt divine beasts whose likenesses surround the Millennium Puzzle on the stone tablet said to hold the memories of the nameless Pharaoh. When Pegasus decided to make them into cards, everyone involved in the project was attacked by the spirits of the Egyptian god monsters, so Pegasus decided to create the cards on his own, under the protection of his Millennium Eye. When Pegasus finished the art-work on the prototypes, he was having a nightmare about the cards attacking him. Shadi told Pegasus that he had angered the Egyptian gods. Pegasus woke up injured after this \"nightmare\". So he decided that these cards were too powerful to be mass-produced, and had Ishizu bury the prototypes in the Pharaoh's tomb. The wielder of these great cards is able to acquire the title of \"Duel King,\" but in the wrong hands, they are capable of causing legitimate injury or even death. These were originally released as promotional cards (in Gameboy Worldwide Edition Promos) for people who just wanted to say they had them, but the cards were later used in Duels and complaints were sent into Konami. Konami responded to this in an FAQ that said these cards weren't to be used. Official tournaments stopped allowing these cards, although there have been rumors that certain official tournaments will allow Obelisk the Tormentor by tributing three monsters but Obelisk will have no other effects. Most people won't duel against these cards at all, but some people will agree to various conditions. All three Egyptian god cards share these similar effects: IN episode 85 of Yu-Gi-Oh! GX a copy of The Winged Dragon of Ra that Industrial Illusions created for testing purposes is stolen by a disgruntled card designer, who later duels Jaden Yuki. The abilities of the card as far as immunity goes is not fully disclosed, however it seems to add a slightly different ruling to already established perceptions, that being that it is unaffected by spell cards entirely. There is a trend in GX for monsters of significant importance, to simply receive blanket immunity from all Spell, Trap and Monster Effects (e.g. Exodius the Ultimate Forbidden Lord). In Yu-Gi-Oh! Nightmare Troubadour, the Egyptian God Cards are affected by card effects that don't Target e.g. Gravity Bind, Field Spell Cards, as well as cards like Smashing Ground and Mirror Force. They are also Tribute Summoned by offering 3 monsters, and include the line that if Special Summoned the card is destroyed at the end of the turn, during the End Phase. In the original manga, the three Egyptian Gods possess a hierarchy among themselves. This is explained as a pyramid, with The Winged Dragon of Ra being at the top, and Slifer and Obelisk at the base (as equals). Because of this, the effect's of Slifer the Sky Dragon and Obelisk the Tormentor do not work on The Winged Dragon of Ra. Where as the effects of Obelisk and Slifer will work on each other, for one turn. This immunity only occurs in the Manga, and not in the anime. However, there remain several disputes over the abilities of god cards, due to the way they are used in the anime. Some contend that in addition to the \"Divine-Beast\" Type, Obelisk is considered to be a Warrior, Slifer a Dragon, and Ra a Machine (mainly due to its Machine-like appearance, although it was classified as a Machine-type monster in the Game Boy Advance games in which it appeared). In an episode of the anime, Yugi Muto's Buster Blader gains 500 points when Slifer is on the field, and it only gains points from Dragon-Type monsters. In the Game Boy Advance games, Yu-Gi-Oh! The Sacred Cards and Yu-Gi-Oh! Reshef of Destruction, the god cards are listed as being of Divine-Attribute, with the above Types. There has been no resolution to the ambiguities, largely as the real-world cards weren't meant for use in competition. In the Basic Game Play FAQ on the Official Web Site there is a question that says \"What do the Egyptian god cards do?\" and it is answered with \"Nothing. They're not legitimate Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game cards. They have no effects and can't be used in your Deck.\" Nearing the finale of the Millennium World storyline in the Manga, there existed a 'Super God', which was a fusion of all 3, called The Creator God of Light, Horakhty. This was never played as an actual card, but was created when the Nameless Pharaoh recovered his lost name, Atem/Atemu, during the Final Ark of the original anime. Horakhty would then destroy the evil Zorc Necrophades, freeing Egypt from its dark power, and impart key information about the final battle that was lost in time. In Yu-Gi-Oh! The Movie: Pyramid of Light, Slifer the Sky Dragon and The Winged Dragon of Ra combine with Obelisk the Tormentor to form a monster with infinite strength. This allowed Yugi to destroy Anubis' Theinen the Great Sphinx with an ultimate attack, \"Titan Firestorm,\" and win the Duel. In the Japanese version of the second series anime, this is the equivalent of Obelisk's \"Soul Energy Max\" ability, which, as alluded to by Seto Kaiba, was a \"miracle of God's anger.\"Naming  The names of the Egyptian god cards are derived from the names of items in Egyptian mythology: The names of the Egyptian gods are the basis for the names of the dormitories of Duel Academy in Yu-Gi-Oh! GX; Slifer Red, Ra Yellow and Obelisk Blue. This also reflects how Seto Kaiba viewed the three Egyptian god cards; Slifer the Sky Dragon was owned by Yugi Muto, his arch-rival, so it was only natural that he holds the card in such contempt. The Winged Dragon of Ra is in the middle, since it was owned by Marik Ishtar, until Yugi won it from him in Battle City; Seto Kaiba was thus neutral to this card. Of course, with Obelisk Blue, it was plainly obvious why he based this dorm off of Obelisk the Tormentor; it was the first and only Egyptian god card he received, and indeed seen the power it holds, until Yugi won it from him in the Battle City Finals.Real-Life God Cards  The use of the god cards is forbidden in all sanctioned tournaments of the Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game because of their unique color templates and backings (red/blue/yellow), and the fact that the cards themselves state that they may not be used in a Duel. As they do not possess effect text, conflicts arise over how they operate once summoned. Some local hobby stores allow people to play \"unofficial matches\" provided everyone playing agrees on their effects. Although the original Egyptian god cards are unusable in an official duel, Obelisk the Tormentor has been released as an effect monster, with an effect identical to the one it possesses in the video games. It is the first and currently the only tournament playable DIVINE monster. The first version of the god cards was released by Konami as a privilege for those who made a pre-order of the Japanese Game Boy Color game Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters IV: Battle of Great Duelist released on December 7, 2000. The second set was released by Konami on April 17, 2003 as special pack-in cards in the Game Boy Advance game Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters International \u2014 Worldwide Edition, the Japanese version of the English-language Yu-Gi-Oh! Worldwide Edition: Stairway to the Destined Duel. Unlike previous versions, the third version of the god cards was not released simultaneously. The Winged Dragon of Ra was included as a limited edition card in the Yu-Gi-Oh! The Dawn of Destiny game for Xbox, released March 23, 2004. Slifer the Sky Dragon was released as a special pack-in card for the ani-manga of Yu-Gi-Oh! The Movie: Pyramid of Light, published November 23, 2004 by VIZ Media. Obelisk the Tormentor, finally, was released as a gift to subscribers of Shonen Jump magazine in May 2005. The god cards once demanded high prices on the secondary market. This was prior to their current widespread availability. During this time, countless counterfeit copies were made and distributed primarily throughout East Asia.Video Games  The Egyptian god cards are present in Yu-Gi-Oh! The Sacred Cards, Yu-Gi-Oh! Reshef of Destruction, Yu-Gi-Oh! Nightmare Troubadour, Yu-Gi-Oh! GX Spirit Caller and Yu-Gi-Oh! GX Tag Force 2. With Tag Force 2, they are only accessible if you have the original Yu-Gi-Oh! GX Tag Force UMD Disc and with Spirit Caller, you need to connect with Nightmare Troubadour. Also,there is a special way of seeing but not controlling the Egyptian God Cards. You must unlock Yami Yugi. It also should be noted that since you may \"trade\" between Nightmare Troubadour and Yu-Gi-Oh! GX Spirit Caller or Yu-Gi-Oh! World Championship 2007 through buying cards from Nightmare Troubadour, it is fully possible to have the Egyptian god cards in either game. The gods are also available in Yu-Gi-Oh! World Championship 2008, but only through use of a cheat device such as Pro Action Replay, a trade through someone who has obtained them, or obtained via the Card Download function, like with \"Thunder King Rai-Oh\". The gods can also been seen in World Championship 2009-- here, Obelisk is an effect monster, and is categorized as such. However, Slifer and Ra are their own individual Monster card types, unseen in the game's navigational menus. Each one is Level 10, Divine Attribute, Divine-Beast Type, and cannot be targeted by Spell, Trap and Monster effects. The Summon of a god card cannot be negated and cards cannot be activated in reaction to their summon. Each god card requires three tributes to be Normal Summoned and cannot be Set. If Special Summoned, they are destroyed during the End Phase. Then you can get the Egyptian God cards in Yu-Gi-Oh! GX Tag Force 3; they are accessible if you have the original Yu-Gi-Oh! GX Tag Force 1 and 2.Crush Card Virus (anime) Trap Cards  Trap Cards are violet-coloured cards that have various effects to make things difficult for your opponent or easier for you in a Duel. A Trap Card must be Set and can only be activated after the current turn has finished, with a few exceptions. Trap Cards are Spell Speed 2, with the exception of Counter Trap Cards, which are Spell Speed 3. Trap Cards may be activated during your opponent's turn. Trap Cards may be Chained to Spell Cards, other Trap Cards, or to the effects of Effect Monsters. In Turbo Duels during Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's, Trap Cards are very common since the use of non Speed Spells is negated, so Trap Cards seem to replace them.Types  A Trap Card's type is designated by a symbol to the right of the words \"Trap Card\". The Trap Card types are:Infinite Cards Change of Heart  {{#declare:Types=typest}}       es:Cambio de Fidelidad {{#set:Card Image=File:ChangeofHeartMRD-EN-UR.jpg}}Yugi Moto  Yugi Muto is a not-so-average kid. Yugi is pure-hearted and child-like. He lives with his grandfather Solomon Muto and mother, although he never speaks of the latter in the English anime. In the Japanese manga, it's explained that Yugi's father is a businessman. Yugi is good at games and puzzles, especially Duel Monsters. Yugi possesses the Millennium Puzzle, which allows his body to bear host to the spirit of the Puzzle, Yami Yugi. Yugi was initially unaware of his existence and control of Yugi's body would involuntarily shift to Yami, when Yugi or his friends are wronged. Yugi is part of a close-knit group of friends: Joey Wheeler, Tristan Taylor, and T\u00e9a Gardner. Miho Nosaka is also one of Yugi's friends in the first series anime. Yugi's friends often cheer him on from the sidelines, and Joey has dueled at his side. Yugi has been friends with T\u00e9a since childhood and is in love with her. T\u00e9a has been shown to have feelings for both Yugi and Atem (Yami Yugi). In Japanese, the first characters of \"Y\u016bgi\" and \"J\u014dnouchi\" combine to form \"Y\u016bj\u014d\" (\u53cb\u60c5), which means \"friendship.\" The \"Yu-Jo Friendship\" card is named after the word and the fellowship between the characters.Design  Yugi's character design was overseen by Kazuki Takahashi. His usual outfit consists of the standard male Domino Junior/Senior High uniform complete with a closed buckled collar. His extremely extravagant hair features multiple layers including long blond crooked, pointy locks for his fringe, the rest features a five large spikes colored black with a magenta sheen along the edges. He wears the Millennium Puzzle on a lace around his neck. In the manga and second series anime, the lace is later replaced with a chain. In the manga (post Volume 7) and in the second series anime, he often wears a KaibaCorp Duel Disk on his left arm. When he and T\u00e9a took a day together to find out about the Millennium Puzzle, he wore a black linen shirt and several pieces of wrist-chains, along with a pair of leather pants. He is seen wearing the same outfit, except for the chains, when he met Jaden Yuki for the first time. However, in GX, Yugi's (present day) face is never directly shown. In Yu-Gi-Oh! Capsule Monsters, Yugi wears a different attire of a violet jacket and jeans. He also wears the Capsule Shooter on his left arm.Second series anime biography Prior to pilot  Yugi lived in his family's game shop, Kame Game, with his mother and grandfather. His grandfather taught him a lot about the game, Duel Monsters. Joey and Tristan used to bully Yugi. Joey even went as far as taking a piece of Yugi's Millennium Puzzle and throwing it into a canel. However Yugi stood-up for Joey and Tristan, when they were attacked by Ushio, claiming that they were his friends, whereas Ushio claimed he was protecting Yugi in order to earn money. Joey and Tristan came to be Yugi's friends after the incident and Joey recovered the piece of the Puzzle. Yugi and Joey once visited Burger World, only to find T\u00e9a working there. She fears that if they tell, she'll get expelled as it's against school rules to have part-time jobs. (In the English version, she worries about getting fired, as they could reveal that she's under 18; the required age to work there.) She splatters their burgers in ketchup, warning them not to tell. They disprove this by saying that they didn't even know that she worked there, and they wouldn't say a word. Yugi later finds T\u00e9a in a warehouse, being filmed by a pervert, who threatens to reveal she's working at Burger World. (In the English version, he was a mugger who tricked her by writing a note, pretending Yugi and Joey had given her a dance studio.) Yugi tackles the man, but gets thrown against a wall. T\u00e9a is also knocked unconscious after trying to attack him. Yugi then transforms into Yami Yugi, who defeats the man in a card draw game and Mind Crushes him. Yugi came to believe he had saved T\u00e9a, although he doesn't remember how he did it.Duelist Kingdom Prior to the tournament  After beating Joey in Duel Monsters, Yugi invites Joey, T\u00e9a and Tristan to see his grandfather, Solomon's rare card, the \"Blue-Eyes White Dragon\", after school. Kaiba, who overheard, ends up kidnapping Solomon and forcing him into a Duel for his \"Blue-Eyes\", as he refused to trade or sell it. Yugi and his friends catch up after Solomon had already been defeated, and witness Kaiba rip the \"Blue-Eyes White Dragon\" in front of them. Outraged, Yugi challanges Kaiba to a Duel, and Solomon gives Yugi his Deck. Yugi duels Kaiba as Yami Yugi and discovers Kaiba has the other three \"Blue-Eyes White Dragons\" in his Deck but defeats him using \"Exodia.\" After defeating Kaiba, Yugi becomes the Duel Monsters World Champion. Since Joey has been having troubles with winning in Duel Monsters, Yugi asks his grandfather to help train Joey. Pegasus sends Yugi a video inviting him to participate in his Duelist Kingdom tournament. Pegasus appears on the video and duels Yugi on the spot while freezing everyone else in the room. He places a time limit on the Duel. Pegasus only won because time ran out seconds before Yugi could lower his life points with his Summoned Skull. As a penalty for his defeat Solomon's soul is stolen. Yugi enters the tournament to rescue his grandfather. At the pier, he gives Joey one of his two Star Chips that are required for entry to allow Joey to participate and help him. Yugi meets Weevil Underwood on the ship to the tournament, who acts friendly to Yugi, including telling him that he knows of new rules that are going to be introduced in the tournament. Shortly after Weevil leaves, Yugi gives Joey the \"Time Wizard\" card, telling him how it can be useful in a tight situation. Yugi meets Weevil again later and shows him his \"Exodia\" cards, which Weevil tosses overboard, to hinder Yugi's Deck. Joey jumps into the water to recover them. After getting two of the cards, the current hits Joey and Yugi dives in to save him. Both of them are then rescued by the stowaways, T\u00e9a and Tristan, who throw them a rope ladder.Preliminaries  After the tournament starts, Yugi tracks down Weevil, determined to get his revenge, but Weevil flees, leading him into a forest. Yugi suspects this is to do with the new rules Weevil mentioned earlier. Weevil leads them to a meadow, where he accepts Yugi's his challenge, as his monsters now get Field Power Bonuses. Yugi switches to Yami Yugi, who bets both his Deck and Star Chip, earning him Weevil's 2 Star Chips after he wins. Yugi cheers for Joey in his Duel against Mai. As Yami Yugi, he offers Joey abstract clues to help him win. Joey defeats Mai using the \"Time Wizard\" card, Yugi gave him. While searching for food, Yugi and his friends, find fish Mako Tsunami had prepared. Unbeknownst to them, Mako had set it as bait to lure opponents, to where his monsters greatly benefit from the field. After sharing the food, Mako challenges Yugi. After switching to Yami, Yugi defeats Mako, winning 2 more Star Chips. Yugi and his friends see a contestant, being forced to leave the island as he is out of Star Chips. The boy says they were stolen, along with his Deck and describes the thief and where he met him. Yugi promises to get his Star Chips back, before the boat leaves the island. Back at the sene of the crime, they meet the thief, who has his face disuised. He duels Yugi with 5 Star Chips on the line. Yami Yugi identifies the thief as Mokuba Kaiba. Mokuba tells them how Yugi humiliated his brother, causing him to leave, giving Pegasus an opportunity to take over KaibaCorp. Mokuba now seeks revenge on Yugi for this. Unable to win the Duel, Mokuba makes a grab for Yugi's Star Chips. Yami discourages Mokuba and promises to help him and Seto. The group make their way back to the bay, but the boat has already left. Yugi shows Kemo that he won back the Star Chips, but Kemo slaps them into the water, including some of Yugi's. Kemo grabs Mokuba to take him back to Pegasus, but Yugi challenges Kemo to a Duel for Mokuba's freedom. Kemo doesn't Duel himself, but tells Yugi to come back in an hour (4 hours in the English version) and he'll have an opponent arranged for him. Yugi returns to the spot, where he faces Ghost Kaiba. Ghost Kaiba pretends to be the actual Seto Kaiba and uses his Deck. With the help of the real Kaiba, who weakens Ghost Kaiba's \"Blue-Eyes White Dragons\", via a virus, Yami Yugi wins. Yugi retrieves Kaiba's Deck, but Kemo has already disappeared with Mokuba. Yugi is unallowed to help Joey in his Duel with Rex Raptor. As the Duel starts Yugi goes to find Tristan, who left in a huff with Joey for accepting those conditions. Tristan reminds Yugi that he should still be at the Duel to offer Joey his friendship, so the two of them return to watch. That night, Mai shares her food with Yugi and his friends, although she promises that they'll be enemies tomorrow. Ryo Bakura appears at their campsite, shortly after Mai leaves for a walk. While the group talks about cards they own, that they an identify with, Yugi encourages T\u00e9a to pick one for herself. Yugi picks the \"Dark Magician\" as his. After everyone has exchanged, which cards they recognize with, Bakura suggests they play a friendly Duel, where Yugi includes the cards Joey, Tristan and T\u00e9a choose; \"Flame Swordsman\", \"Cyber Commander\" and \"Magician of Faith\" and he can show them how his card, \"Change of Heart\" works. Bakura changes to Yami Bakura, who traps the group's souls in the cards they selected. He proceeds to take Yugi's Millennium Puzzle, but Yami Yugi emerges. Yami faces Yami Bakura, in a Shadow Game, to return his friends, but staking his Millennium Puzzle. Yugi's friends appear in place of the monsters they selected as Yami Yugi Summons them. When the Dark Magician, Yugi is Summoned, the 2 Yugis meet. In the Japanse version, Yugi was aware of Yami's existance and the two of theme agree now is not the time to keep secrets. Yugi tells his friends of Yami's existance, that he is the spirit of the Millennium Puzzle and apologises for not telling them before. In the English version, Yugi admits to having felt Yami's presence while he duels and feels they can trust him. Yami manages to win the Duel, with the help of Ryo betraying Yami Bakura, returning everyone to normal. Although T\u00e9a, Tristan and Joey believe the Duel to have been a dream, Yugi doesn't take time to explain as they hear Mai scream. The group find the Eliminator, Panik, who has just beaten Mai and taken all eight of her Star Chips. Yugi accuses Panik of being a coward and duels him as Yami Yugi, winning back Mai's Star Chips. He offers them to Mai, who reluctanlty takes them back, saying she owes him one. Later that night Kaiba arrives on the island and Yugi returns his Deck. The next day, Mai leaves a letter explaining she's left and owes Yugi for winning back her Star Chips. Joey later gets seperated from his friends. They search a cave after finding his wallet outside. After running from many traps, they find Joey in a Duel with Bonz. But after Joey wins, Bandit Keith's gang trap Yugi and his friends in the cave, by sealing the entrance with a boulder. Using Bakura's Millennium Ring as a guide, the friends find the Paradox Brothers guarding the exit. Yugi and Joey face them in a Tag Duel. After winning Yugi and Joey, each have enough Star Chips to enter the finals. Yami Yugi passes the brothers riddle test in order to exit. At the stairs to Pegasus' castle, T\u00e9a ponders on Yugi's differing personalities and wonders if there could be two Yugis. Yugi admits to feeling as though there is someone else living inside him, but hopes he isn't going crazy. At the top of the stairs, Kaiba blocks the way and talks Yugi into a Duel. Yami takes control and faces Kaiba, using his Duel Disk technology. As Yami is about to win, Kaiba stands up on the edge of the castle, such that the shockwaves from Yugi's attack may cause him to fall to his death. (In the English anime, Yugi speaks to Yami, telling him not to do it.) Yami contemplates, but overall decides to attack. T\u00e9a runs to Yugi insisting that this isn't like him and calls for the ordinary Yugi to come out. Yugi takes control in time to cancel the move. He falls to his knees, disgisted by what he's done. Kaiba takes his turn and wins the Duel, claiming 5 of Yugi's Star Chips. Now fully aware of the other Yugi's existance, Yugi admits it to his friends, telling that he is afraid of him and consequently afraid to Duel. Kaiba calls Yugi weak, but T\u00e9a protests arguing that Yugi saved him and Kaiba is the real loser. After Kaiba leaves, Yugi continues to mope. Joey offers Yugi to take his Star Chips, so he may enter the finals, but Yugi ignores him. Frustrated Joey grabs Yugi by the shirt, asking him if he cares about his Grandfather. Mai appears and is briefed in on what just happened. She offers Yugi her excessive Star Chips, as per her promise from earlier, but Yugi doesn't even acknowledge Mai's appearance. Annoyed Mai tells him to grow up and hangs on to the Star Chips. She accuses him of being afraid to Duel again and challenges him. T\u00e9a instead accepts the Duel, to win back Yugi's Star Chips. Yugi begins to slowly snap out of his depression as he watches T\u00e9a duel. After Mai surrenders, Yugi approaches her about the face-down card she didn't use. Mai denies that she lost for him. (In the English version, she says that some cards just aren't worth playing.)Finals  Inside the castle, the group are invited to watch Pegasus duel Kaiba. Seeing as Kaiba is dueling to save Mokuba, Yugi offers support to Kaiba. Kaiba is trapped in Pegasus' \"Soul Prison\" card, after his defeat. Yugi then shouts down to Pegasus' asking who he is to mess with people and their families like this. The finalists, T\u00e9a, Tristan and Bakura are treated to a meal that evening, where the finalists get paired-up. After the meal, Yugi gives Joey his \"The Glory of the King's Hand\", as it is mandatory for each finalist to possess either it or \"The Glory of the King's Opposite Hand\". That night, Yugi is woken by his grandfather's voce, calling him. He follows it and finds a \"Soul Prison\" card, with his grandfather's soul inside. Solomon warns him about Pegasus and is accompanied by the cards containing Seto and Mokuba Kaiba's souls. Yugi wakes up afterwards, wondering if it was a dream. Yugi faces Mai in the first Duel of the finals. In the Japanese version, Yami Yugi gives little effort to the Duel, as he worries about facing Pegasus, whereas in the English version, Yugi refuses to let Yami duel, fearing how he may harm their opponent. Either way results in Yugi playing poorly. Encouraging words from Mai, return the Yugis to the top of their game and allow them to turn the Duel around and emerge with a win. Yugi cheers for Joey in his Duel against Bandit Keith. Yugi inevitabely faces Joey in the final round. Joey uses all he learned from Yugi, but is still defeated, by Yami Yugi. Afterwards, Joey offers to give \"The Glory of the King's Hand\" back to Yugi, so he may claim the prize money. However Yugi declines, as he had entered to tournament with the intent of saving his grandfather and now the Kaiba brothers. The money is not important to him, but Joey needs it for his sister's eye operation. Yugi advances to duel Pegasus. At the start of the Duel, Yugi requests that the Kaiba brothers souls be released as well as grandfather, if he wins. Pegasus accepts but indicates that he plans on taking Yugi's soul if he wins. He learns of Pegasus motive to steal his Millennium Puzzle to try revive his deceased wife Cecilia. Pegasus uses his Millennium Eye to read Yami Yugi's mind during the Duel, but Yami Yugi and Yugi continue to switch minds so Pegasus cannot read the other's strategy. After the Yugis destroy Pegasus' \"Toon World\" card, Pegasus transports them all into the Shadow Realm. In the Shadow Realm, Yugi loses his life energy while doing the mind shuffle strategy, and Pegasus continues successfully reading Yami's mind until Joey, T\u00e9a, and Tristan block his Millenium Eye. Yami defeats Pegasus, returning them both back from the Shadow Realm.Aftermath  Pegasus disappears after his Duel with Yugi. Determined to ensure the captive souls are returned, Yugi and his friends search for Pegasus. They find a number of Pegasus' men carrying him away after he was assaulted by Yami Bakura. Croquet explains that he was attacked. (In the English version, he says he has fallen ill.) Yugi and company head to Pegasus' tower, where they find a diary entry addressed to new King of Duelists who defeats him, explaining why he created Duel Monsters. Yugi then spots the 3 \"Soul Prison\" cards, which are now blank, meaning the souls are no longer imprisoned. As he leaves the tower, Yugi bumps into Shadi, who uses his Millennium Key to enter Yugi's mind. To Shadi's surprise he finds two soul rooms; one for Yugi and one for Yami. Shadi ends up in a Shadow Game with Yami, but is rescued by Yugi. Yugi informs Shadi that he doesn't believe his other self intends to harm him and asks Yami to release Shadi from the game. A door opens, leading them to a room lined with stone tablets of Duel Monsters. Yugi learns from Shadi that millennia ago, Egyptian kings played Shadow Games with real monsters and magic. After the games became a war that threatened to destroy the world, one brave pharaoh sealed the magic away. The duo are confronted by the Dark Magician. Shadi prepares to counter by Summoning the Blue-Eyes White Dragon. However Yugi insists that the Dark Magician would never harm him and asks the magician to let them past. To Shadi's astonishment the magician complies. Seeing Yugi's control over the Dark Magician, Shadi believes he may be the chosen one. Shadi returns himself and Yugi to outside Yugi's soul. Before disappearing, he tells Yugi his name and claims to have not told it to anyone before. After the group find Mokuba is back to normal, Croquet hands Yugi the other prizes on behalf of Pegasus, who has been taken to hospital. Yugi receives the card \"The Ties of Friendship\", is crowned the King of Games and also receives the 3 million dollar cheque, which he gives to Joey for Serenity's eye operation. Kaiba thanks Yugi for saving Mokuba and insist that have a fair Duel someday to determine who is the better duelist. Yami Yugi congratulates Yugi on saving everyone. In the English version, Yugi points out that he doesn't even know Yami's name. Yami replies that he has been called many things such as Pharaoh, Yu-Gi-Oh and Yami. Yugi refers to him as Yami and says he is glad to call him his friend, while Yami is proud to be one. Yugi and his friends get a lift back to Domino City from Kaiba. As Yugi brings his grandfather home from the hospital, the group is confronted by Rebecca Hawkins. She accuses Solomon of stealing her grandfather's \"Blue-Eyes White Dragon\" and challenges him to a Duel. At Kaiba Land, Yugi faces Rebecca in the Duel, as his grandfather is unfit to play. The Duel turns out to be an exact repeat of the Duel, their grandfathers played long ago over a drink of water. Like how Solomon surrendered back then as Arthur needed the water more, Yugi surrendered to teach Rebecca about the Heart of the Cards. Just then Arthur arrived and showed that Yugi could have won and explained why he surrendered. After Rebecca apologizes, Yugi gives her the card, \"The Ties of Friendship\".Battle City Prior to the tournament  Yugi replaces the lace around the Millennium Puzzle, with a chain. Yami Yugi appears to compliment Yugi on the change and offers him advice on impressing T\u00e9a, who is waiting for him. Embarrassed, Yugi asks what he's talking about. As Yugi leaves the room, his mother asks who he was talking to. He says nobody and dashs off, telling Yami to stop picking on him, as he offers to help make T\u00e9a love him. (The Yugis talking about T\u00e9a and the scene with Yugi's mother are removed from the English anime.) Yugi meets up with T\u00e9a and heads to school with her. (In the English version, they were going to a soccer game) Yugi tells her about the other Yugi; that he lives in the Millennium Puzzle, is worried about his destiny and has no memory of his past. On the way, Yugi bumps into a fortune-teller and reluctanly lets him hold the Puzzle in order to read his future. The fortune-teller knocks the table over at Yugi and T\u00e9a, while he runs off with the Puzzle. Yugi and T\u00e9a split-up in pursuit of the thief. Yugi follows a series of arrows. Despite knowing its a trap, Yugi had no other choice. The thief, who turns out to be Bandit Keith in disguise, controlled by Marik Ishtar, must defeat Yugi in a Duel, before he can claim true ownership of the Millennium Puzzle. Without Yami's help, Yugi faces Keith to win back the Puzzle, while the Puzzle is bolted to a wall. Yami Bakura senses an evil presence and pinpoints in to the Duel. Seeing Keith controlled, Yami Bakura uses the Millennium Ring to break Marik's control. Keith struggles to resist being repossessed, but Marik takes control long enough to have Keith smash the Puzzle. Bakura swings down from a rope, knocking Keith out. As Bakura collects a piece of the Puzzle, Yami Bakura seals a fragment of his soul inside it, before returning it to Yugi. Keith regains consciousness and continues to struggle with Marik's mind control, setting fire to the warehouse in his confusion. Unable to remove the piece of the Puzzle connected to the wall, Yugi stays in the burning building to reassemble it. After inserting the last piece he collapses, but is rescued by Joey and Tristan. Worrying about how the Puzzle almost got stolen, Yugi takes time to talk with Yami. He learns that Yami has no idea of who he once was, as he has lost all his memories. The duo suspect that their new enemy is in possession of a Millennium Item. Yugi asks T\u00e9a if she could spend time with Yami to see if would help him regain his memories. He asks T\u00e9a out, but switches to Yami just before the date. Not expecting this Yami starts shouting into the Puzzle at Yugi, until noticed by T\u00e9a. On the date, Yami and T\u00e9a learn from Ishizu Ishtar that Yami was once an Egyptian pharaoh and that Yugi must enter the upcoming Battle City tournament to stop their new enemy. While talking with T\u00e9a, about Duel Monsters at school, T\u00e9a asks which card best suits Yugi, assuming he'd pick \"Dark Magician\". However Yugi explains that while \"Dark Magician\" is powerful, \"Maha Vailo\" better suits him, as it's not the strongest card, but it had hidden power. He'd like to have picked \"Dark Magician\", but thinks it's better suited to the other Yugi. The day before the tournament, Yugi and Joey pick-up their Duel Disks in order to compete. The next morning Yugi finishes reconstructing his Deck for the tournament.Preliminaries  Yugi spots Joey trying to talk the Rare Hunter, Seeker, who won his \"Red-Eyes Black Dragon\", into a rematch. Yugi notices his robes are the same as the ones Bandit Keith was wearing, while he was possessed. Seeker refuses to face Joey again, but challenges Yugi to a Duel. Yugi accepts and switches to Yami. After defeating Seeker, Yugi takes back Joey's \"Red-Eyes Black Dragon\". Marik then uses Seeker as his puppet to communicate with Yugi. He introduces himself, tells Yugi how he's after the power of the pharaoh and warns him that are more dealdy Rare Hunters. Yugi offers Joey back the \"Red-Eyes\", but Joey refuses and says he'll wait until he's a true duelist before earning it back. Yugi is lured into a tent by a harlequin, where he faces the Rare Hunter, Arkana. As Yami Yugi, he faces Arkana in a Duel, where the loser's feet get cut off by a buzzsaw. (In the English version, they got sent to the Shadow Realm by energy disks.) Yami wins the Duel, but Yugi then takes over and saves Arkana from buzzsaw (energy disk). At the canal side, while Yugi talks with Yami about recent happenings they are confronted by another Rare Hunter, Strings. Strings, who is under Marik's complete control, duels Yami Yugi using the Egyptian God Card, \"Slifer the Sky Dragon\". Yami manages to win the Duel, earning \"Slifer the Sky Dragon\" through the Ante rule. Kaiba challenges Yugi to a Duel on the spot, but Marik warns Yugi that he is going to take control of Joey. Yugi declines Kaiba's challenge as he must find save his friend. As Yami Yugi searches the city for his friends, with Kaiba's help, he disposes of a number of Rare Hunters, gaining enough Locator Cards to qualify for the finals and locates Joey at Domino Pier. Yugi is made duel Joey, who is possessed by Marik at the pier. Each player has their ankles chained to an anchor, which will drag them underwater to drown after the timer reaches 0. The only way for either player to save themself is to defeat their opponent, which will open a box, giving them a key. Yami takes the first few of Yugi's moves, but Yugi insists that he should fight this battle himself. Through talking to Joey and using \"Red-Eyes Black Dragon\" to remind him of his promise to become a true duelist and even giving him the Millennium Puzzle, Yugi manages to get Joey's subconsciousness to ignore Marik's commands. Yugi manages to fully snap Joey out of Marik's control shortly before forcing himself to lose. With Joey back to normal, Yugi tells Marik that he is the true loser of this Duel. Yugi lets his Life Points fall to 0 and collapses, releasing Joey's key. However Joey manages to force the Duel into a Draw, releasing Yugi's key too. Using the chain, Joey swings to Yugi's side of the field and grabs his key, before the anchor drags them both down. He unlocks Yugi, who floats to the surface and is brought ashore by Tristan. Serenity dives in with the other key to save Joey. Afterwards Joey apologizes and returns the Millennium Puzzle. Yugi thanks Yami for trusting in him and Yami says that Yugi has taught him the strength behind kindness and that one day Yugi will surpass him in every way. Afterwards Mai gives Yugi and his friends a lift to the finals.Quarter-finals  Yugi, Joey, Mai, T\u00e9a, Tristan, Duke and Serenity arrive at the KaibaCorp Stadium for the finals. Yugi is suspicious of the finalists Marik, who is under the guise \"Namu\", and Ryo Bakura, who should be in the hospital. T\u00e9a clears any suspicion of Namu, informing Yugi of how he saved her Joey and Bakura earlier. Shortly after Odion Ishtar, pretending to be Marik arrives, everyone boards the blimp, where the finals are to take place. As Yugi prepares for the finals in his room, he adds \"Slifer the Sky Dragon\" to his Deck, thinking he's going to need it to face Marik. He also suspects Bakura has come into contact with the Millennium Ring again. Yami Yugi faces Bakura in the first of the quarter-finals on the Stratos Dueling Arena. Yugi's suspicions are confirmed as they face Yami Bakura. When Bakura is one turn away from winning with \"Destiny Board\", the two Yugis agree they must use \"Slifer\" to defeat him. After Yami Yugi Summons \"Slifer\", Marik switches control of Bakura's body from Yami Bakura to Ryo, who is too weak to withstand the attack. However Yami Bakura disagrees with Marik's plan and takes control of Ryo's body and invited Yugi to attack him, refusing to let his host die. Yugi wins the Duel, knocking Bakura unconscious and in need of medical attention. During the intermission before the next Duel, Yugi unsuccessfully tries to get Kaiba to make an emergency stop to take Bakura to a doctor. He then goes to his room, where while examining his Deck, he meets Shadi. Shadi tells Yugi how the Egyptian God Cards were created and why he must stop Marik from getting his hands on them. After Joey defeats Odion, who was still pretending to be Marik, Joey exposes his opponent as a fake. With Odion defeated, Namu is exposed as the real Marik and Yami Marik takes control of his body. Marik confronts Yugi, saying the battle for the Pharaoh's power has now begun. After losing to Kaiba, Ishizu Ishtar tells Yugi of the Ishtar family's history and gives him the Millennium Necklace, as he will be needing all 7 Millennium Items to recover the Pharaoh's memories. That night Yugi is woken by T\u00e9a, who reports Bakura is missing. They discover he's dueling with Marik, but loses shortly after they arrive.Virtual World  The Battle City blimp gets sucked into a mechanical fortress in the sea, by Noah Kaiba. Yugi, Joey, Tristan, T\u00e9a, Serentiy, Duke, Kaiba and Mokuba are greeted by a projection of the Big Five, who explain that they got trapped in the Virtual World, after they failed to trap Kaiba there, during the Legendary Heroes game. For that they hate Yugi and his friends for helping Kaiba. Having Kaiba as a common enemy, Noah uploaded their minds into his computer system. Using an altered form of Duel Monsters, they plan to face the gang in order to claim possession of their bodies, so that they may exist in the real world. The group are then transported to a virtual jungle, where they are given a demonstration of the Deck Master rules. The Big Five then seperate the gang, by making holes appear under them. Yugi ends-up at a pond, where he is faced by Gansley, who has taken the form of \"Deepsea Warrior\". Before dueling Gansley, Yugi changes to Yami Yugi, who Gansley identifies as \"Type-B\". During the Duel, Yugi notices that their Deck Master, Kuriboh is trying to tell them something. As Yami is about to lose, Yugi takes over and uses Kuriboh's Deck Master effect to save them. Shortly afterwards, Yugi collapses and Yami finishes the Duel. The Yugis enter a hallway. Although they are aware there are traps behind some doors, Yugi runs through one, after hearing T\u00e9a scream, but is thrown back by an attack. Yami draws the Level star of the door to Yugi's attention, so Yugi Summons a monster of a higher Level, \"Winged Dragon, Guardian of the Fortress\" and has it launch an attack into the doorway. They enter the doorway and end-up repeating the exact same process Realising it's because they keep chosing the Level 1 door, they start attacking different Levels. The final door has the 2000 ATK, Level 4 monster, \"Flash Assailant\", backed up with a series of face-down Magic or Trap Cards. Yugi uses \"Heavy Storm\" to clear the face-downs and \"4-Starred Ladybug of Doom's\" effect to destroy \"Flash Assailant\". Yugi arrives at the scene of T\u00e9a's Duel, but is held back by a wall of ice. \"Dark Magician\" is taken from Yugi's Deck and Summoned to T\u00e9a's field, after she plays \"Sage's Stone\". Attacking with both \"Dark Magician\" and \"Dark Magician Girl\", T\u00e9a defeats Crump, causing the ice around her to disappear. Yugi rushes to her aid and gives her his coat. Together they walk though the ice region and enter a door, taking them to a courtroom, where Joey is dueling Johnson. Yugi correctly suspects that Johnson has rigged the outcome of Joey's luck based cards. Although Noah attempts to disqualify Johnson, Joey insists that they continue with the game unrigged. After Joey wins, he, Yugi and T\u00e9a exit though another door. The trio find their way to Duke, Serenity and Tristan's Duel against Nesbitt. After the Duel, the gang try to find Tristan, befor the Big Five take his body. They briefly meet up with Kaiba and Mokuba, but are attacked by Nesbitt in possssion of Tristan's body. The real Tristan in the body of a robot monkey helps them fight the imposter. However Nesbitt kidnaps Mokuba and Kaiba takes off after him, leaving the others think about what to do with the monkey, not knowing it's Tristan. The group take a pick-up truck to go after Kaiba. On the way, they find out the monkey is Tristan, when he accidentally flips a switch, allowing him to speak normally. After watching Kaiba duel Lector, Yugi and T\u00e9a go with him to help him find Mokuba. The others try to follow, but the tunnel disappears, before they can enter. Inside the tunnel Yugi and T\u00e9a get seperated from Kaiba, and find themselves in a simulation of Kaiba's mansion back when Seto Kaiba got adopted. Yugi finds a picture of Kaiba's father with Noah, shortly before meeting up with Kaiba again. Noah then shows the three of them a projection of the past, where Gozaburo shows Noah a picture of Seto, who Noah must be able to compete with in order to run KaibaCorp. Noah transports Yugi, T\u00e9a and Kaiba back to their friends, where they are confronted by the Big Five, now all in possession of Tristan's body. Yugi and Joey team-up to duel them in order to win back Tristan's body. Although Yugi and Joey win, the Big Five attempt to steal their bodies, but Noah takes them away, along with Tristan's body, before they can. Since Noah designed the robot monkey, they search it for clues. Yugi pushes a red button, taking them to a virtual KaibaLand. From there the gang take a handcar througha a subway and end up on the scene of Noah and Seto Kaiba's Duel. Noah wins and turns Seto and Mokuba to stone. This causes Yugi to get mad and change to Yami, who accuses Noah of foul play, as he used Mokuba as a shield to help him win. As Yami he combines his Deck with Seto's and continues the Duel. Noah gradually turns Yugi's friends to stone as Yami duels, until there are no more left. Yugi then offers Yami support and takes im to his soul room. Inside he takes Yami to a room containing his recent memories, where everyone turned to stone offers their support. Back in virtual reality, Yami imagines Yugi's friends giving him the cards drawn by \"Card of Sanctity\" and uses them to defeat Noah. After the Duel, Noah attempts to steal Yugi's body and escape to the real world, but the power of the Millennium Puzzle forces Noah back. After Noah finds out, Gozaburo had been using him, he tries to help everyone escape the virtual world. He takes them to a virtual Domino City. The group get seperated and meet-up again, minus the Kaiba's. Having realized Noah double crossed them, Yugi starts to blame himself for trusting Noah. Gozaburo has monsters attack Yugi and his friends as they look for a way out, but Yugi and Joey fight them off by Summoning monsters from their Decks. Noah, having stolen Mokuba's body and escaped to the real world, organizes a missile attack to destroy the fortress, including the servers for the virtual world. After having a change of heart, he contacts the group and explains that they must get out out quickly before the virtual world is destroyed. Noah tells them to go the arcade. Yugi, Duke and Joey fight off more of Gozaburo's monsters, while T\u00e9a, Serenity and Tristan go there. When Yugi, Duke and Joey get to the arcade, Noah asks Yugi to go get Seto before returning himself. Yugi complies and goes to the KaibaCorp building, catching Seto shortly after he beats Gozaburo in a Duel. Gozaburo takes the form of a monster and chases the two. Noah instructs them to jump off the building. With no other option they comply, but awaken in the real world, before hitting the ground. Yugi, Kaiba and Mokuba run to escape the fortress before the missiles strike. Joey and Tristan help them get onto the moving blimp, as they leave Noah's fortress, before it gets destroyed.Battle City finals  The KaibaCorp blimps takes the finalists to the Duel Tower for the Battle City finals. Yugi switches to Yami Yugi for the Battle Royale to determine match-ups and ends up with Kaiba as his opponent. During the \"Clash in the Coliseum\", Yugi must face Kaiba in the rematch of the Millennium since their bout in Duelist Kingdom. Both Yugi and Kaiba summon the respective Egyptian God Card each of them possesses, but the Duel ends up in a heated stalemate, as neither Egyptian God is able to destroy the other. In the end, after a frightening flashback of Ancient Egypt, where Yugi and Kaiba see their prvious incarnations conduct a Shadow Game, both Gods are destroyed, so both Yugi and Kaiba fall back on summoning their favorite Cards (Dark Magician and Blue-Eyes White Dragon, respectively) to battle each other. When Kaiba summons his 2 other Blue-Eyes with The Flute of Summoning Dragon, Yugi considers forfeiting the Duel, but is convinced by Joey's spirit to look at all his options, and he discovers that there is something he can do. And so, he summons \"Red-Eyes B. Dragon\"\u2014which Joey had given to him after he'd defeated the Rare Hunter\u2014and activates \"Magician's Selection\" to destroy \"The Lord of Dragons\", leaving \"Spellbinding Circle\" free to weaken one of the Blue-Eyes White Dragons enough for Red-Eyes to destroy it. The Duel ultimately culminates and concludes after Yugi Fusion Summons \"Dark Paladin\" and combines him with \"Diffusion Wave-Motion\" to strike the final blow and win the Duel. As per the ante rule of the Battle City Tournament\u2014and after Kaiba berates Yugi with his delusion that everyone in the world is alone\u2014Yugi is given Obelisk the Tormentor before \"The Final Face-Off\" with Marik. In \"The Final Face-Off\" between Yugi and Marik, Marik duels Yami in a Shadow Game where the loser ends up forfeiting his good side, but as Marik pointed out, no matter who won, an innocent soul would be lost forever\u2014and if Yami Yugi lost, Yugi would vanish into the Shadow Realm, and the Pharaoh would cease to exist. Yami manages to summon both Slifer and Obelisk to attempt to win, but Marik manages to complete his Immortality strategy, locking down Yami's attacks by combining Egyptian God Slime with Jam Defender before reviving Monster Reborn and using it to summon his Winged Dragon of Ra. The Duel ultimately culminates and concludes with the destruction of both Ra and Yami Marik (thanks to Yami Yugi's \"Ragnarok\" card), and when Marik regains control of his body and mind, he forfeits the Duel to Yami Yugi, destroying Yami Marik, and gives him his Winged Dragon of Ra card, and, in addition, shows him the hieroglyphs tattooed on his back. According to Marik and Ishizu, the \"Secret of the Pharaoh\" is written somewhere in the hieroglyphs, and only the possessor of the Millennium Puzzle and the 3 Egyptian God Cards can unlock that secret.Yu-Gi-Oh! GX  In Yu-Gi-Oh! GX, Yugi, Seto Kaiba, and Joey Wheeler are regarded as legendary duelists. Jaden Yuki, bumps into him on the way to the Duel Academy sign ups. Yugi gives Jaden the card \"Winged Kuriboh\". In the Japanese version he says the card is lucky. In the English version, he says that he feels the card belongs with Jaden. Yugi's Deck goes on display at Duel Academy. Later on, it is stolen by Dimitri, who duels Jaden with it. Afterwards the Deck is returned. While Lyman Banner was giving a history lesson and mentions Yugi and Kaiba. One of the girls in the class calls him a dream boat, and another girl says that he is one of the best looking. While Jaden is dueling T-Bone, Jaden gives T-Bone some words of wisdom, which Solomon Muto believes to be exactly what Yugi would have said. While Bob Banter is caught spying on Alexis Rhodes, he distracts Jaden, Syrus and Hassleberry, by saying \"Hey look! It's Yugi\", so he make his escape. When Jaden's duels Frantz, who stole a copy of \"The Winged Dragon of Ra\", Pegasus compares Jaden to Yugi. During one of Aster Phoenix's flashbacks, Pegasus mentions Yugi being \"Number 1\" in his top five duelists, with Kaiba as number 2, Joey number 3, Aster number 4, and Jesse Anderson as number 5. Mr. Stein talks about Atem and Thief Bakura while dueling Jaden. During Jaden's last year, the person who had gained the most graduation points at the exam would get a copy of Yugi's Deck (excluding the God Cards). Chazz Princeton, Alexis Rhodes and Syrus Truesdale qualified, but turned down the prize in favor of their own decks. During the graduation party, Jaden is led by Winged Kuriboh to the room containing Yugi's Deck. Yugi appears and sends Jaden back in time to duel his younger self. Yugi seems to be taller and more muscular. The two engage in a Duel. Yugi is impressed by Jaden's \"Elemental Heroes\". After Jaden gets the upper hand, Yugi switches to Yami Yugi, who Summons \"Slifer the Sky Dragon\", stating that the only worthy opponent for Jaden is a god. Jaden then remembers the important thing that he had lost - how to have fun in a duel regardless of its importance - and has Neos attack Slifer. No outcome to the Duel is shown, but before the end of the episode, Jaden said \"Yugi-san, I'll become stronger. And when the time comes...\" Suggesting he was unable to surpass Yugi.Voice  The voices differ slightly between the different series and the English dub, although commonly the voice of Dark Yugi is stronger and more confident than that of Yugi. In the first series anime, Yugi and Dark Yugi are voiced by Megumi Ogata. Yugi's voice is positively timid, rarely showing any strength and almost always being polite in his speech, using honorifics and \"boku\" as his personal pronoun. Dark Yugi's voice is much rougher, uses \"ore\" as his personal pronoun and rarely ever uses honorifics. He also has a catchphrase, saa, geimu no jikan da (It's game time), usually spoken immediately after the change. In the Japanese version of the second series anime, Yugi and Dark Yugi are voiced by Japanese singer Shunsuke Kazama. Yugi has considerably more confidence than in his previous appearance, but is still very polite. It's harder to distinguish between his voice and Dark Yugi's, but Dark Yugi's tone is considerably sterner and has the same pattern of speech as his previous appearance. This series also established Yugi calling Dark Yugi mou hitori no boku (the other me) and Dark Yugi referring to Yugi as aibou (partner). In the English version of the second series anime, Yugi and Yami Yugi are voiced by Dan Green. Yugi's voice is high pitched and sometimes strained in more emotional moments, and generally has a friendly tone towards everyone. Yami Yugi's voice, in comparison, is fierce and commanding. Yugi's last name is pronounced \"Moto\" in this version, although it is still spelled \"Muto\". In the Singaporean dub of the second series anime, Yugi and Yami Yugi are voiced by Chuck Powers. In this dub, Yugi's voice is soft and slightly high-pitched, while Yami Yugi's voice is near the total opposite. In the Singaporean dub, both Yugi and Yami Yugi speak with a slight drawl. In the first season, Yugi calls Yami Yugi \"spirit\", then in other seasons Yugi started to call him \"pharaoh\". Sometimes, he also calls him Yami. Yami Yugi always called Yugi by his name.Relationships T\u00e9a Gardner  T\u00e9a has been Yugi's friend since childhood. T\u00e9a is in love with Yugi, but no one knows if she loves Yugi more than his other half. The fact that Yugi and Yami Yugi are two seperate beings causes her confusion as to who she really loves. She also does have feelings toward the original Yugi as it is shown in many episodes when Rebecca Hawkins hugs Yugi, T\u00e9a appears upset. She has also shown jealousy towards Mai Valentine for her initially flirtatious attitude towards Yugi during her first appearance at Duelist Kingdom, as well as Vivian Wong.Yami Yugi/Pharaoh Atem  After putting the Millenium Puzzle together, a \"walk-in\" spirit entered his mind and bonded with him. Yugi was initially unaware of Yami's existence and control of Yugi's body would involuntarily shift when Yugi or his friends are wronged. After finding out about the spirit, he was afraid of him, but eventually grew to accept this revelation as well as Yami himself. The two develop a father-son bond, and Yugi begins to grow, becoming stronger as he remains in Yami's shadow. After winning the Ceremonial Duel, Yugi was upset to see him go, claiming that he was weak and wasn't ready. Yami, proud of him, tells him otherwise, and as he steps through the door to the afterlife, Yugi gives him a thumbs up, now ready to go on his own.Joey Wheeler  Joey initially bullied Yugi along with Tristan, but after he saw how Yugi stood up to Ushio, he became a close friend to him. When he was possessed by Marik, Yugi took Yami's place to get his friend back to his senses. After Joey's first Duel with Marik, Yugi couldn't believe he was dead, and was in grief. Joey, likewise, was upset when Yugi's soul was taken by the Seal of Orichalcos.Gaming items Deck  Yugi's Decks are most famous for his \"Dark Magician\". Yugi's Deck probably has the most variety and balance of any other character's Deck in the series, and is sometimes referred to as a Strategy deck. His original Deck mostly composed of low Level EARTH and DARK monsters. The deck also originally had Exodia in it, which he used in the first episode to defeat Kaiba, but on the ship to the Duelist Kingdom, Weevil Underwood threw them overboard, and even though Joey Wheeler attempted to save them, only two of the five pieces were ever recovered, which were the head and the right arm. During the Battle City arc, he keeps the theme of having EARTH and DARK monsters with dangerous effects. His Magnet Warriors become a major part of his Deck, as does his \"Dark Magician Girl\". His Deck from Battle City onward focuses more not only on his \"Dark Magician\", but also on his manipulation of his Spell Cards that are designed to destroy or negate the effects of his opponent's Spell Cards and Trap Cards. The rarest card in his Deck (aside from the previously lost Exodia) is \"Dark Magician\", of which he has only one (though during Battle City when he was challenged by Arkana, the rules specified that the winner of the duel would obtain the loser's \"Dark Magician\". Although Yugi won, it's unknown whether he actually took Arkana's \"Dark Magician\"; however, if he did, he never used it. It is unlikely, though, that Yugi would use Arkana's \"Dark Magician\" card, as he determines during the duel that it has been tampered with, having its edges trimmed. Arkana did have two \"Dark Magicians\" though, so it isn't known if Yugi took one or not). As the series progresses he adds more support for his \"Dark Magicians\", such as \"Dark Magic Curtain\", \"Magical Dimension\", \"Dark Renewal\", \"Sage's Stone\" and \"Skilled Dark Magician\". During the Dawn of the Duel arc, Yugi uses a deck based around cards with a Toy theme and LV monsters such as \"Silent Swordsman\" and \"Silent Magician\". This deck represents the strength Yugi has without the help of Yami Yugi as well as his playful side. When Yugi's Deck goes on tour at Duel Academy, the Copycat duelist Dimitri steals it and copies Yugi's voice, mannerisms and dueling style. While Dimitri copies Yugi's moves very well, he loses because he lacks the bond with the cards that Yugi has. This Deck is based around the \"Dark Magician\" and retrained Chaos varients of Yugi's Ritual Monsters. In Yu-Gi-Oh! GX, when Jaden travels to the past to duel Yugi, the deck Yugi uses is one of his Decks from after Battle City but before the Dawn of the Duel arc. In Yu-Gi-Oh! R, Yugi uses a Toy Deck, centered around Yugi's childish side, using cards such as \"Toy Magician\" and \"Toy Box\".References Shrink Duel Disk  Duel Disks are a series of devices manufactured by KaibaCorp as a portable form of the Duel Arenas used in the early part of the Yu-Gi-Oh! second series anime. They use a portable hologram generator to display Duel Monsters cards, and in the case of the Mark 1, the player's hand. Since their introduction in the anime and manga, they have become a staple among duelists.Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Disk (Version 1)  During the Duelist Kingdom arc, Seto Kaiba developed the first generation duel disk prototypes as a means of countering Pegasus' mind reading techniques. Seto gambled that Pegasus needed face to face contact for his mind reading to work so as a feature of the disks, holographic projections of the cards obstruct the duelists from seeing each other. This duel disk was physically and functionally different than the ones that would follow. Where the others are a single piece construct which houses the deck, graveyard, life point counter and cards in play, The first Duel Disk system had two components joined by a retractable cable, The wrist component houses the deck and life point counter, and the actual disk component holds 5 cards. Users would load the cards as explained later into the disk and throw it yo yo style, causing hologram to be projected from it. The duel disk system also changed the rules of Duel Monsters. They followed Duelist Kingdom rules except for the following changes: An early variation of this system is used in Toei's Yu-Gi-Oh! movie.Duel Disk (Version 2)  Prior to the Battle City Tournament, KaibaCorp developed the second generation Duel Disk, the first one to be released to the public. Issued to participants of Battle City, this Disk played the game according to the new revisions (which make it closer to the real world version.) Unlike the previous Duel Disk, it did not need to be thrown. (In the Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, sealers flew out of the Duel Disk to the sides of the dueling area. These disappeared in Yu-Gi-Oh! GX.) When in use, it resembled an arm blade. Monsters that are in play are placed on the five slots on the blade either in Attack or Defense position. Directly underneath each Monster slot is another slot for Spell and Trap Cards. If a Duelist were to activate a Set card, they would activate a button on the round portion of the disk. Another slot can open on the front end of the disk that is used for the Field Spell Card. The center of the Disk includes the Deck and Graveyard slot and Life Point counter. The bottom part of the disk (the part that goes around an user's arm) also contains a retractable cable that could be attached to duel arena systems (in the anime, Kaiba used a cable somewhat similar to a USB device). Ever since their introduction, almost all duels were conducted with these, or with the later introduced Chaos Duel Disk. In Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's, This version of the Duel Disk is shown being used by citizens of The Satellite, indicating that this model has become obsolete, replaced with the more modern versions shown in GX, as well as the D-Wheel and other Duel Disk versions that are shown. Also, the protagonist of 5D's, Yusei Fudo, is shown to remove a duel disk from his D-Wheel which has a startling resemblance to this version, possibly indicating that he has modified the obsolete model for use with his D-Wheel. Despite other models of Duel Disks being used primarily in each series, this version of the Duel Disk has appeared in all three anime series, as shown with all the students who tried out for Duel Academy prior to receiving the Academy-issued Duel Disk and the residents of Satellite.Yami Marik  Yami Marik is Marik Ishtar's evil alter-ego and the main protagonist of the Battle City arc.History  When Marik had the symbol of the Ishtar clan carved into his back by Lord Ishtar, Yami Marik was born from the hatred and pain he suffered. Months later, Marik and Ishizu went outside but came back and found that Odion was getting killed by Lord Ishtar. Marik's anger woke Yami Marik and he killed his father. Odion, who had a symbol carved in his face, sealed Yami Marik away when he woke up.Battle City  In the semi-finals of Battle City, Odion was set to duel Marik, however, Odion surrendered. Marik grew angry and killed him, awakening Yami Marik. Yami Marik faced Jason Krueger in the finals and was beating him with his two Egyptian God Cards. However, Krueger turned the tables and defeated Yami Marik, sealing him away forever.Red Dragon Archfiend/Assault Mode Synchro Monsters  Synchro Monsters are the newest type of Monster Card, first released in Starter Deck 2008. The colour of their card frame is white. These cards are included in the Extra Deck. Synchro Monsters require Tuner Monsters to be face-up on your Field. When the total Level of the Tuner monster and any other face-up monsters on your Field exactly matches the Level of the Synchro Monster you wish to Summon (no more or less); by sending them to the Graveyard, you can \"Synchro Summon\" the Synchro monster. Some Synchro Monsters require a specific \"Tuner Monster\" in order to be Synchro Summoned (such as \"Junk Synchron\" for \"Junk Warrior\") or monsters of a particular Type or Attribute as Material Monsters, but many do not, so they can be in just about any Extra Deck. Because Synchro Monsters belong in the Extra Deck, they return there whenever they would be returned to the hand or Main Deck, like Fusion Monsters before. Also, like Fusion Monsters, they cannot be Special Summoned from the Graveyard if they were not properly Synchro Summoned first. Synchro Monsters may be considered a more refined version of an older method of summoning monsters from the Fusion Deck known as Contact Fusion. Both Contact Fusion and Synchro Summoning simply require certain monsters to be on the field in order to summon the desired monster; the main difference is that Contact Fusion does not require the player to keep track of the number of levels of the monsters on the field, and the cards used for the summon are sent to the Graveyard. Some players have begun to use the term 'Synchronize' or 'Tune/Tuning' to then list which Tuner Monster and non-Tuner monsters will be sent to the Graveyard when they perform a Synchro Summon and summoning a Synchro Monster (\"Tune\" is more common, because it's the term used in the TV show). (i.e. \"I Tune my 'Quillbolt Hedgehog' [LV2] and 'Speed Warrior' [LV2] with my 'Junk Synchron' [LV3] to Synchro Summon 'Junk Archer' [LV7, requires 'Junk Synchron' as the Tuner]!\") There are currently no Aqua, Fish or Divine-Beast-Type Synchro Monsters in TCG or OCG. However, they have released Synchros for certain Archetypes of monsters, including the Aliens, Iron Chain and Blackwing monsters. XX-Saber Gottoms is currently the only Synchro Monster that you can use more than 1 Tuner Monster for its Synchro Summon since in its conditions it says \" 1 or more EARTH monsters\", not \"1 or more non-Tuner monster(s)\".Example  Also see List of Synchro Monsters See Also: \"Synchro Summon\".Normal Trap Cards  Normal Trap Cards are Spell Speed 2, and can be used in response to the effects of everything that is classified as Spell Speed 1, such as Effect Monsters, and Spell Cards, or Spell Speed 2, which include Quick Effects, most other Trap Cards, and Quick-Play Spell Cards.MFG Yu-Gi-Oh! RPG Wiki Main Page  Part of MFG's Yu-Gi-Oh! RPG? Well, this is the site for you then. This site contains data on every duelist, card, arc/saga, and item present in the RPG.Zorc Necrophades  Zorc Necrophades is the god of darkness and rules over Dark World. Even though he isn't as strong as some of the other world rulers, he is considered the most powerful, since he has the largest  army.History  Zorc was born when the Millennium Items were originally created. He was summoned by Akhenaden, one of the Pharaoh's priests, in Kul Elna village. Zorc attempted to destroy the human world but was stopped by the Pharaoh at the time, Atem. He was sealed in the Millennium Items for over 3,000 years.Duelist Kingdom  Although, he did not appear in this arc, the Necrophades Cult, led by it's current leader, Zenaku Tanaka, began it's plan to resurrect their dark lord. At the end of the tournament they took Pegasus' Millennium EyeBattle City  The Necrophades Cult skipped the Battle City tournament and continued to attack Jason Krueger, who had become their main target. They also continued their search for the Millennium Items, taking  Marik's Millennium Rod,  Bakura's Millennium Ring and  Yugi's Millennium PuzzleDark One Cometh  The Necrophades Cult finally arrived in Egypt and attacked the Eye of Horus, taking  Shadi's Millennium Key and Millennium Scale, and  Ishizu's Millennium Necklace. With all 7 Millennium Items in their position, they travelled to Kul Elna village, where Zorc was originally born, and resurrected him. Krueger, his friends and the Eye of Horus finally arrived but couldn't fight Zorc off. Shouhei Matsuda betrayed the Necrophade Cult and distracted Zorc for long enough so the Eye of Horus could combine the three Egyptian God Cards into The Creator God of Light, Horakhty. Zorc barely survived the battle and retreated, along with the remains of the Necrophades Cult, to their base in Domino City. Using all the power he could, he tried to bring forth the Dark Horde from Dark World, but he could only bring in a small percentage of them. He spent the next seven years, trying to find out how to bring back his powers, and found out the only way was to absorb the energy of the Egyptian God Cards or monsters with similar powers. Zorc couldn't get his hands on the God Cards, since they were so well protected, but he found out about the Sacred Beasts, which were sealed under Duel Academy for protection.GX  After three years of preparation, Zorc has sent two of his minions to Duel Academy, so they can find out as much information as possible about the building and the Sacred Beasts. Then after giving him enough information, Zorc, the Necrophades Cult and the Dark Horde will go to Duel Academy and use the Sacred Beasts to revive his full powers. He will then bring forth his full army and then will take over the world.Ivan Myers Krueger Ivan Krueger  Ivan is sometimes referred to as the \"Prince of Dueling\" since his father is the \"King of Dueling\".Counter Trap Cards  Counter Trap Cards are the third variety of Trap Cards, and are the only Spell Speed 3 cards in the game. This means that the only thing that can be used against them are other Counter Trap Cards. Primarily, they deal with preventing the activation of the effects of other cards, though there are noteworthy exceptions such as \"Intercept\". Counter Trap Cards can be activated in the Damage Step, even if their effect does not alter ATK/DEF. At least a few Counter Trap Cards are vital in most Decks--without the ability to prevent an opponent's card effect from activating, there is little guarantee of being able to prevail against an opponent, especially if the player has no idea what the opponent's strategy is or what cards they may be playing. Many of the more powerful Counter Traps have a cost or downside to using them, however, so attempting to rely on a very large number of them may result in greatly diminished resources for the player to use. To make up for the cost in using them, a group of Fairy-type monsters usually referred to as \"Counter Fairies\" has been released, which reward the player for using Counter Trap cards. \"Van'Dalgyon the Dark Dragon Lord\" is another extremely powerful monster that summons itself and further disadvantages the opponent when a Counter Trap Card is activated. Relevant Icon:Continuous Trap Cards  Continuous Trap Cards are Trap Cards that stay on the field after activation. The effect(s) of these cards will remain active until the owner either cannot maintain a cost or condition, or it is destroyed. One example of a Continuous Trap Card is \"Spellbinding Circle\", which effectively freezes an enemy monster on the field, so it can neither change battle position, nor declare an attack. Most Continuous Trap Cards require a cost to maintain, or possess a conditon under which the card is destroyed. Two Examples of these are \"Imperial Order\", and \"Call of the Haunted\". \"Imperial Order\" requires a cost of 700 Life Points to maintain, but \"Call of the Haunted\" is destroyed when the monster used with it is destroyed. Another such example of a Continuous Trap Card is \"Royal Decree\", which negate's Trap Card's effects. However, since it's still Spell Speed 2, it cannot be used against cards like \"Magic Drain\", \"Seven Tools of the Bandit\", \"Negate Attack\", or \"Trap Jammer\", since they are all Counter Trap Cards, and thus all Spell Speed 3. You can activate Continuous Trap Cards, and activate their Ignition-like effects on the same Chain. For example, when your opponent activates \"Monster Reborn\" you can activate \"Royal Oppression\" and activate its effect on the same chain. Also, cards such as \"Chain Burst\" and \"Curse of Darkness\", have to be face-up on the field before the card it inflicts damage against is activated; you cannot chain these cards to the activation of the card type mentioned, and still maintain the effect of inflicting damage. This is because the timing has been missed; the card in question has already been activated. Some continuous trap cards also become monster cards when activated; like Stronghold the Moving Fortress, which gives you more defense when you have no monsters.Example Fusion Monsters  Fusion Monsters, colored violet, are cards representing a combination of two or more monsters. Fusion Monsters may only be included in the Extra Deck, and cannot exist in the hand or Main Deck. If a Fusion Monster is returned to its owner's hand or Deck, it is instead sent back to the Extra Deck. However, they may be sent to the Graveyard when destroyed, as well as removed from play. In the anime, the original didn't use them a lot. In Yu-Gi-Oh GX, however, introduced many fusion cards and many powerful fusion monsters were released during this time. In Yu-Gi-Oh 5D's Synchro Monsters appear to have filled this position. Originally, the only way to properly summon a Fusion Monster was through a Fusion Summon involving the required cards as well as Polymerization. Monsters used with Polymerization are called Fusion Material Monsters. If a Fusion Monster is Special Summoned to the field via a card such as Metamorphosis, and then sent to the Graveyard, it cannot be Special Summoned to the field from the Graveyard with cards such as Premature Burial, Call of the Haunted, or Monster Reborn. In order for a Fusion Monster to be returned from the Graveyard to the field, it must be Fusion Summoned properly. There are some Fusion Monsters that have special Summoning Conditions. For example, the Elemental Hero Fusion Monsters have a clause stipulating that they may not be Special Summoned unless they are being Fusion Summoned. This also rules them out from being Special Summoned either from the Graveyard or when removed from play. Others may disallow the use of Fusion Substitute Material Monsters, and in even rarer cases, both of these conditions may be applied, such as in Rainbow Neos. Fusion Monsters even have their own Equip Spell Card: Fusion Weapon There are a few ways to properly Fusion Summon a Fusion Monster: And a few ways to Special Summon a Fusion monster: 1 Fusion Material Monster can be replaced by Fusion Substitute Monsters in Fusion Summons with cards that either do not specifically state the monster to be used as a Fusion Material Monster, or do not have a summon condition that limits either what monsters may be used for the Fusion Summon, or in what way it may be summoned. Most Fusion Monsters need two Fusion Material monsters, and then the Polymerization card. However, certain Fusion Monsters can be summoned out of the Extra Deck via a process known as Contact Fusion, which requires no Polymerization.Tribe-Infecting Virus Interdimensional Matter Transporter Necrophades Cult  Led by Zorc Necrophades, the Necrophades Cult is a mysterious group that has been clouded in mystery for thousands of years. The earliest Necrophades Cult documents go back to when Zorc was first defeated by the Pharaoh, 3000 years ago.Character design  The members of the Necrophades Cult wear dark, black hooded capes. When members are inducted into the Cult, they have the face of Zorc Necrophades, carved into their back.History  When the lord of darkness, Zorc Necrophades, was defeated by the pharaoh, the Necrophades Cult was created by a few underground thieves, who worked for the king of thieves, who was sealed in the Millennium Ring. Throughout the years, the Cult assassinated anyone who started to found out about the evil Cult. Even the former US President, John F. Kennedy. When, Zenaku Tanaka was elected as leader, the Necrophades Cult included new rules and methods to find new members. One of their main methods was to capture newborn babies and give them to a male and female Necrophades member, making out they were his or her actual parents. When the child was old enough join the Necrophades Cult, which is 16 years old, the other members kill the fake family and use this new-found hatred in the child to secure his place in the Cult.Duelist Kingdom  This was how Shouhei Matsuda was brought into the clutches of the Cult. As he was being brought up, he took part in numerous tournaments. He never won, but he always put up an incredible performance. Eventually, Shouhei's \"parents\" were killed in a fire and Zenaku told him to enter the Duelist Kingdom tournament which was being held by Maximillion Pegasus, the creator of  Duel Monsters . This was the final test to secure Shouhei's place in the Cult. Shouhei entered the tournament and got to the Semi-Finals against Jason Krueger before he was forced to leave to the Cult's underground bae, which was located in Domino City. Shouhei had the symbol of the Necrophades Cult carved into his back and from then on, he was treated as scum by a good deal of the other members. However, one member of the Cult stayed behind and stole Pegasus' Millennium Eye.Battle City  Zenaku didn't get involved in the Battle City tournament as he was busy planning his final plan. However, he captured Krueger's girlfriend Claudia Donovan and had a tracking device put in her arm, so they could locate Krueger any time they liked. For the rest of the tournament, Krueger and the others saw little of the Necrophades Cult except for the end of the tournament, when they took  Marik's Millennium Rod,  Bakura's Millennium Ring and  Yugi's Millennium Puzzle.Dark One Cometh  Six months after the tournament, Zenaku travelled to Egypt with the Necrophades Cult, to resurrect Zorc. They attacked the Eye of Horus, taking  Shadi's Millennium Key and Millennium Scale, and  Ishizu's Millennium Necklace Krueger and the others arrived to try and stop Zenaku, but it was too late. Zorc was resurrected and all seemed lost for Krueger. The Eye of Horus, a cult lead by Ishizu Ishtar and the main enemies of the Necrophades Cult, tried to fuse the Egyptian God Cards together to summon, The Creator God of Light, Horakhty but Zorc wouldn't allow it. Shouhei had a change of heart and distracted Zorc long enough so the Eye of Horus could summon Horakhty. Even though Zorc put up a good fight, Horakhty was too powerful and eventually defeated Zorc. Krueger, the Eye of Horus and everyone else thought that was the end of Zorc and they went home, thinking it was all over. However, Zorc lived, even though over 90% of his power was lost. Using all the power he could, he tried to bring forth the Dark Horde, his army, from Dark World, but he could only bring in a small percentage of them. He spent the next seven years, trying to find out how to bring back his powers, and found out the only way was to absorb the energy of the God Cards of monsters with similar powers. Zorc couldn't get his hands on the God Cards, since they were so well protected, but he found out about the Sacred Beasts, which were sealed under Duel Academy as protection.GX  After three years of preparation, Zorc has sent two of his minions to Duel Academy, so they can find out as much information as possible about the building and the Sacred Beasts. Then after giving him enough information, Zorc, the Necrophades Cult and the Dark Horde will go to Duel Academy and use the Sacred Beasts to revive his full powers. He will then bring forth his full army and then will take over the world.", "Red Dead Wiki": "Red Dead Wiki Weapons in Redemption  There are a variety of weapons featured in Red Dead Redemption. They are essential to survival, as well as an integral part of everyday life in the American West. The player is able to use a range of weapons ranging from Civil War era manually operated weapons all the way to the cutting edge, semi-automatic weapons of the time.Inventory  The player can carry every weapon that is acquired in inventory, but only eight are active for selection at once. Each weapon occupies a slot on the weapon inventory wheel. The player can switch between guns of the same slot. Only one handgun and one long gun (the Sawed-off Shotgun counts as a long gun) are visible on the character at any one time. When dueling or in certain cutscenes, Marston will use whichever pistol or revolver is currently equipped. The weapon wheel sorts weapons (clockwise, from the top) by: Marston can also buy a Bandolier to hold twice as much ammunition for repeaters and rifles, as well as adding to his appearance on some\u00a0outfits. The bandolier has rifle rounds on it, pistol rounds are attached to the belt.Ammunition  Ammunition for the weapons of Red Dead Redemption are split into seven distinct categories and two special categories exclusive to the Undead Nightmare DLC. Each type of ammunition is used in all of the weapons within that category. In Single Player, ammunition can be obtained from the dropped guns of enemies. Dropped guns shine to indicate that they can be walked over and collected for ammo. Ammunition can also be looted from the body of a killed enemy or be taken automatically after hogtying an enemy. Chests found throughout the world may also contain varying quantities of ammo along with other loot (such as money) as well as killed enemies. One of the easiest ways to obtain ammunition is from a Safehouse; each bedroom (except rented ones) contains a chest with a quantity of ammunition, but types and amounts are determined randomly (the amount of money in them is determined randomly as well). The Improved Campsite has the same function, but instead the ammo goes into the satchel without player action. To maximize the amount of ammunition the player obtains from the Safehouse chests and the Improved Campsite, it is best to complete Rank 5 of the Sharpshooter Challenges. In Multiplayer, boxes can be found on the map (both in Free Roam and in the various game modes) which contain ammunition for all weapons except for the Explosive Rifle. Ammo can also be obtained in the same manner in Single Player by walking over the guns of killed enemies. Ammunition can also be purchased from gunsmiths which are located in certain towns. The price of ammunition depends on the map location, type of ammunition, and the number of boxes purchased. The lasso and hunting knife can be used infinitely.Firearms  All of the firearms featured in Red Dead Redemption are modeled after real world weapons. Weapon details are simplified, however. For example, all revolvers use revolver ammo - there is no distinction between different calibers. In the charts below, links are provided to the closest approximations of the real world inspiration for each in-game firearm.Pistols and Revolvers  Pistols and revolvers are located at the top of weapon selection menu. In most cases, they have less range and firepower than long firearms, but they have the benefit of being able to be handled with just one hand. Because of that, they are very useful when steering a carriage or when pursuing enemies on horseback. You can fire while losing less control of your carriage than when using a long firearm. They also have a good amount of max ammo and are quick to reload. They can be used in close and medium ranges, but because of the lack of long range, they are not made for hunting.Rifles and Repeaters  Rifles and repeaters are located at the bottom of the weapon selection menu. They have both a longer range and more firepower than most pistols. Rifles are often more powerful than repeaters and are great on long distances. But because of this, they are not made for hunting, since they will obliterate birds and other small animals, leaving nothing to skin. Repeaters often contain more bullets and can fire a little faster, but are less powerful. However, because of this they are well used for hunting, not only on the ground but on horseback as well.Scoped Rifles  Scoped Rifles are located at the bottom-right of weapon selection menu. Like the name, these rifles contain a scope and are also known as sniper rifles. They have a lot of firepower and an extremely long range. Instead of a regular aiming mark, they will be scoped automatically when aiming. This can both be an advantage and a disadvantage as they are perfect for long ranges, but are not made for medium and close combat. They are best used when engaging enemies at long ranges, since you can kill a couple if not more enemies while they can't hit you (unless they also have sniper rifles). It should be noticed that these are the only firearms without auto-aim, therefore they are useless on horseback as you have to be stationary to place a good shot. These rifles also have low max ammo and low fire rate. Enemy snipers will be marked with a scope glint while they are aiming.Shotguns  Shotguns are located at the right of the weapon selection menu. Shotguns are very good for close range since they do not fire a single bullet, but rather a large number of pellets. They have a quick rate of fire and also good reload speed and firepower. However, they do not contain a large magazine.Thrown Weapons  Thrown weapons are found in the top left of the weapon selection menu. As the name suggests, these weapons have to be thrown and are not shot like most weapons in the game. Fire bottles and dynamite are efficient for killing groups of enemies, and throwing knives are useful for silent kills. In addition to firearms, the player can obtain various thrown weapons:Mounted Weapons  These weapons are stationary and cannot be directly moved by the player from the location of deployment.They are superior to regular weapons and have unlimited ammo. They are found on very specific places, mostly when the mission requires them.Equipment  Other than the above, there are other types of weapons and equipment the player can select from the weapon wheel. However the Hunting Knife can be used to kill enemies on very close range without alerting others, they are not particulary for killing enemies. The lasso is used for taking people out without killing them. It is also necessary for horsebreaking jobs and to take a wild horse. The knife is automaticly selected when skinning animals or cutting someone free.Downloadable Content  The following weapons are added by DLCs. The Tomahawk and Explosive Rifle are added to single player, multiplayer, and Undead Nightmare while the remaining weapons are available within Undead Nightmare only.PVP Weapon Locations  Each map location and game mode in multiplayer provides a different set of weapons to players. See the main article for details.Weapon Challenges  Weapon challenges in multiplayer provide XP, Titles, and the ability to turn weapons golden. See the main article for more details.Tips  When using most guns, aiming needs to be precise. Sometimes this may be tricky but there are some ways that may improve your accuracy and precision. First of all, by taking advantage of the aim assist in the game, it's easy to take out multiple enemies in seconds. When the enemy is near the center of your screen, holding down the aim button will lock on to the enemy, depending on how close they are; this snap provides good accuracy. To better utilize the aim assist, after firing multiple shots or killing an enemy, briefly stop aiming and aim again quickly to lock on to the next enemy. However, this still may take a long time to kill the enemy. After having mastered the technique, practice aiming up slightly after locking on until successfully obtaining a perfect headshot. However, you may not need to use this technique depending on the weapon being used. Experienced players often utilise a technique of rolling, then locking onto an enemy, tapping the thumbstick up and then immediately firing, as a way of simultaneously dodging fire and also pulling off a headshot. This technique is difficult to master, as it requires precise knowledge of how far to tap the thumbstick for the headshot. This technique is best used with a rifle or revolver from medium to close range. It also can be used for long range, as experienced players can use a Henry Repeater or a Bolt Action Rifle and get a headshot from more than 100 yards away. Remember that players using Dead Eye\u00a0can always outshoot you if you let them, so aiming for the head is the best option. If they do use Dead Eye, find some cover and shoot them when they reload. \u00a0Use shotguns only at very close range and pistols at no further than mid-range. Repeaters are accurate at most ranges, although sniper rifles are better if the target is very far away. Players with the Golden Guns Weapon Pack will get extra fame for killing people. Despite the fact that thrown weapons, the knife, the explosive rifle and the tomahawk don't turn gold the extra fame still applies. Marston will automatically reload all of his firearms without any input from the player once the ammo in any of them has been depleted.Trivia Achievements/Trophies  There are a number of achievements/trophies related to the use and ownership of weapons. Unlike the challenges listed above, these achievements are not limited to Multiplayer sessions and can be unlocked during the Singleplayer campaign.Missions in Redemption  Listed below are the storyline missions in Red Dead Redemption. The narrative of Red Dead Redemption spans three different territories and over 57 different missions which are separated in 4 chapters. Completing each unique mission tallies in the Missions Module of the Social Club interface and counts towards 100% completion.Single Player  For a view of the mission tree, see Missions in Redemption/TreeNew Austin Chapter John Marston Bonnie MacFarlane Leigh Johnson Nigel West Dickens Seth Briars Irish Nuevo Paraiso Chapter Vincente de Santa Landon Ricketts Luisa Fortuna Abraham Reyes West Elizabeth Chapter Edgar Ross Harold MacDougal Marston Ranch Chapter Abigail Marston Uncle Jack Marston Stranger Side-missions  Listed below are the 19 Stranger side-missions featured in Red Dead Redemption. The player must complete 18 of these missions, excluding \"I Know You\", to achieve 100% Completion.Outlaws to the End Undead Nightmare Survivor Side-missions Notes Trivia See also Outfits in Redemption  Outfits are sets of clothing that can be worn by John Marston or by his son, Jack Marston, in Red Dead Redemption.Overview  There are\u00a0fifteen or\u00a0sixteen outfits available in Red Dead Redemption, depending on which version is being played, and an additional four that can be added to the main game through DLC. Another four outfits are exclusive to Undead Nightmare, yielding a total of\u00a0twenty-four possible outfits across all versions of the game. Acquisition of nine of the non-DLC outfits counts towards 100% Completion\u00a0as detailed below. Some outfits are awarded for completing gameplay missions, while other outfits must be earned. They are initially unlocked by advancing through gameplay missions, and accumulating Fame and Honor, or by downloading them from DLC or pre-orders. Once unlocked, players must track down various \"scraps\" by completing mini-games such as Five Finger Fillet and Arm Wrestling. Other scraps must be discovered, purchased, or looted. Some outfits give Marston bonuses or special abilities when worn. Accessories such as the bandana, which nullifies changes to the player's Honor, and the Bandolier, which increases the amount of ammo the player can carry, can be used in conjunction with outfits. Certain missions require the player to equip a particular outfit, but in general, any outfit may be worn. Over time, outfits will get dusty. Dust transfers over to other outfits when the player changes clothes. Dust can be washed off by wading in water. The only outfit that does not gather dust is the Gentleman's Attire. The Duster Coat seems to gather dust quickly.Changing Outfits  In general, the player can change between any unlocked outfit while in their safehouse. There is one exception, however. At the start of the Abigail Marston mission\u00a0\"The Outlaw's Return\"\u00a0when the player obtains the Rancher Outfit, the player won't be able to change outfits again until having completed the Jack Marston mission\u00a0\"The Last Enemy That Shall Be Destroyed\".Standard Outfits  Thirteen outfits are available in all versions of the game without additional downloads. One additional outfit is available in select versions of the game. All available outfits can be unlocked through cheat codes.100% Completion  Obtaining these nine outfits is required to achieve 100% completion in the game.Other Outfits  These five outfits, although available in the main game, do NOT need to be obtained for 100% completion.Downloadable Outfits  Downloadable outfits are not required for 100% completion.Undead Nightmare Exclusives  These four outfits are available only in the Undead Nightmare single-player campaign.Hunting  Hunting plays a very prominent role in Red Dead Redemption and Red Dead Redemption II. The player can hunt all featured animals (with the exception of the bats that fly over Tumbleweed every evening) for sport and money, but killing animals may also be necessary for survival, as many of the animals found in the world, such as bears and cougars, can easily kill the player in only a few hits. Successful completion of Master Hunter: Rank 10 allows the creation of Vittles after skinning an animal.Description  The hunting in the game can involve stalking, advancing upon the targeted animal, and finally making the kill. This system makes the game very similar to the actual sport of hunting. Animal bait can be bought from merchants at stores to attract various animal species. Skinning an animal allows the player to acquire material from the animal, which includes furs, skins, carapaces, hides, teeth, pelts, claws, fangs, feathers, meat, hearts, tusks, antlers and horns. These resources can then be sold to merchants for various prices in various places; this is considered by many to be one of the fastest sources of gaining money as it can allow the player to gather hundreds of dollars worth of resources within minutes, and does not require waiting for an event to be available, such as bounty hunting. When the player skins an animal, Marston can be seen crouching in front of the animal. He will then take out his knife, and begin to skin the animal, using up to three different cuts, depending on the size of the animal. After initiating the skinning process, an animation of John Marston cutting while blood splats on the screen, shows. It is also possible to achieve a slightly higher camera angle (although the animal will still be out of view) if the player crouches before initiating the skinning animation. Animals are randomly generated in the wilderness and can sometimes assault the player, his allies, and his horse, requiring intervention. Marston will sometimes encounter strangers screaming for help as they are pursued by some type of predatory animal, such as a wolf or bear. Eliminating the pursuing animals (and therefore saving the stranger) will grant Marston money and fame. Additionally, hunting at least one of every wild animal species in the game will earn the player the Unnatural Selection trophy/achievement. After a kill, vultures may appear, opening up the sharpshooting challenge. Completing this and other challenges will earn the player fame, and can unlock outfits\u00a0for\u00a0Marston. The blood of any animal will act as bait for predators, so when an animal is killed, keep a lookout for wolves, coyotes, cougars, bears or any other animal likely to scavenge. This also means that never-ending waves of animals may appear. If you kill a pack of wolves a new pack of wolves will appear shortly after, the same will keep happening, only with less time between each individual wave. But beware, if you hunt too close to a town or settlement, you will soon have a bounty on your head and the law chasing after you.Animals  There are 36 different (not including legendary)\u00a0animals that can be encountered in Red Dead Redemption\u00a0and any of the listed animals can be hunted. Different animals supply the player with different pelts, claws, meat and other resources with different values, which can be sold. Killing some animals may not please their owners or the townsfolk. Slaughter of an owned horse or a domesticated dog is a crime and, if witnessed, will result in a bounty. This is considered \"Animal Slaughter.\" Being seen killing cattle will also place a bounty on the player, called \"Livestock Slaughter.\" These animals all interact throughout the wild in a carefully crafted ecosystem. For instance, the player could be traversing the plains and see a herd of buffalo grazing, or while traveling through a forest, one may encounter a cougar hunting an elk, or a grizzly bear defending its territory from a pack of wolves. Each animal behaves differently; however, they can generally be placed within one of two categories: passive and aggressive. Passive animals are harmless to the player, and will usually flee at any sign of danger or if the player gets too close and is detected by the animal. Tamed animals such as broken horses or farm cattle will not flee but will still move away slightly due to a sense of personal space. Aggressive animals will attack the player either as prey or because they feel threatened, they are usually predatory, exceptions include the boar, the bull. Beware of these animals even when dead, as it is rare to encounter an aggressive animal traveling alone; for example, wolves always travel in packs but some animals like coyotes will travel alone but even though they don't usually attack don't let that fool you because they will occasionally attack. Animals of different species have different habitats, so time of day sometimes matters as much as location when trying to hunt down specific prey. Players having trouble spotting a particular critter in the day time may often find it to be worth their while to camp out and wait for nightfall. A wise hunter knows which weapon to use for each type of animal. A small firearm may not make a sufficient impression on a large predator, while some heavy weapons turn humbler creatures into fine red mist (thus preventing the player from skinning them or obtaining body parts necessary for some quests). Some animals only exist on one side of the US/Mexican border. This means that Marston's kills can fetch a higher price on the other side. This also applies to animals found only in West Elizabeth. The following animals appear in the various areas of Red Dead Redemption:Tools of the Trade  When hunting small game (birds and small mammals) it is advisable to use a smaller caliber gun (Repeater Carbine or Cattleman Revolver). If too large a weapon caliber is used, the animal being hunted has a tendency to explode in a red shower of blood, leaving no remains to be harvested (e.g. shooting a beaver with a shotgun will not produce any skinnable remains). It is useful to use a horse when hunting large or more dangerous animals (e.g. bear, cougars, elk, wolves etc.)\u00a0Horses can allow you to chase the fast herbivores as well as giving the powerful predators a run for their money. The Hunting Knife is always described as a lesser weapon, but can be very useful while hunting, as it provides a silent kill. This is good to use on horseback. It is also the tool used for skinning. Throwing Knives are useful too, as they provide a silent short distant kill and can kill with one or two throws. Bait is a very useful tool, as it attracts a large group of animals in the vicinity. But be warned: a group of bears or other fairly dangerous animals may come after the player. Usually when using bait, you mainly get wolves or coyotes in the vicinity, so these animals usually scare away your desired animal of finding. The binoculars can be used to see very far away. It is not only good for hunting, but also for scanning the horizon, seeing enemies, and finding herbs. This item is obtained in the West Elizabeth mission, At Home With Dutch. The player can also use dogs when hunting. This may or may not be a more useful way. Mainly at MacFarlane's Ranch or Manzanita Post there will be collie type dogs roaming around. Whistle near them and they will follow you. Once you leave the area the area they should go ahead and start tracking animals. If they find something they will begin barking and sprint off in the direction toward the animal.Hunting Challenges  Hunting Challenges, which can be done both as part of the single player experience and in multiplayer Free Roam sessions, will reward the player for hunting down and killing set amounts of the most dangerous animals. In single-player, Marston will hunt and skin many animals in his quest to be a Master Hunter.Hunting Grounds  The Liars and Cheats DLC adds four hunting grounds to Free Roam in Multiplayer.Tips and Tricks Bonus Downloadable Outfits  Expert Hunter Outfit: This was one of the contenders for the outfit pre-order bonus along with the Deadly Assassin Outfit and the Savvy Merchant Outfit. The voting ended February 15, 2010 and the Deadly Assassin outfit was named the winner. However, Rockstar revealed that this outfit and its required challenges would be released as DLC (Downloadable Content) for free in Summer 2010 for all platforms, being released along with the Savvy Merchant Outfit on October 12, 2010. This outfit, when worn, allows you to receive double the amount of skins & hides from hunting. That makes it very useful for quick hunting.Achievements and Trophies  These Trophies/Achievementsinvolve the hunting and/or skinning of animals:Red Dead Redemption Red Dead Redemption  Red Dead Redemption is a Western Action-Adventure game developed by Rockstar San Diego.

This list contains spoilers about the secret achievements or trophiesTrivia Undead Nightmare  Undead Nightmare is an expansion pack to Red Dead Redemption. The pack features an entirely new single-player campaign that follows John Marston as he tries to find a cure for the highly infectious Undead plague that has spread across the frontier. Upon release, the list prices were $15.95 AUS dollars, $9.99 US dollars, \u00a37.99, \u20ac9.99 or 800 Microsoft Points. It was released on October 26, 2010. Undead Nightmare is started by choosing single player in the main menu, after which the options Undead Nightmare and Red Dead Redemption appear (or one can purchase the disc itself).Synopsis  Seemingly overnight, an Undead plague ravages the once bountiful frontier, decimating the landscape and reawakening the dead. In towns, settlements, and outposts throughout the world, the uninfected citizens are left to fight for survival against waves of the undead. John Marston must ride out into the vast and terrifying world and survive long enough to find a cure. Along the way through frontier towns, deserts, prairies, and mountain passes, Marston will help survivors, cleanse towns, and put an end to the undead hordes.Background Detail  The game is set after saving John's family and before his eventual execution, but, obviously, it does not fit in to the canon, as many characters (Such as Uncle) die multiple times (for example, Uncle is the first zombie encountered and killed by John Marston, though in the original game, he dies in Edgar Ross' attack on the farm). An infectious outbreak of unknown origin amongst those on the frontier is rumoured to be caused by either Seth Briars stealing the glass eye from Tumbleweed, Nigel West Dickens with his miracle tonic, or the Mexicans by bringing the disease over the border from Nuevo Paraiso.Story  In Undead Nightmare, John is in his house with Abigail and Jack. They are all talking about general things, like a book Jack is reading, however, they mention that Uncle hasn't returned from what he was doing yet. John however states that because of the storm, Uncle has probably gone to a dry place nearby and will stay there until the storm subsides. Uncle is then seen loitering outside the house. Later that night, while John and Abigail are asleep, Uncle, revealed to be undead, invades their room and tries to attack them, and John fights back, seemingly knocking him out. John heads for his gun in a nearby shed; however, on his way back, Abigail runs out of the house screaming, pursued by Uncle, who bites her in the neck. John shoots Uncle in the head, ending his suffering and tends to Abigail. Jack comes outside and tries to help his mother. However, Abigail becomes aggressive and bites Jack, infecting him. Meanwhile, John runs for his lasso and hogties both of them. After giving them both a plate of food, he leaves them in the house and sets out to find a cure. John then goes to Blackwater, where he finds Professor MacDougal, who returned from Yale to document the undead infestation. He claims he has left his bags with Nastas, and heads down the street to grab them. MacDougal is killed by an infected Nastas however, and John is forced to clear out Blackwater and look for more survivors. He finds a family on a roof, killing undead, however they are no help. John then finds another group of survivors, who all give him multiple theories they suspect caused the plague, including a \"Snake oil merchant\" and a \"Freak with a glass eye\". If John goes to Tanner's Reach, he will meet a hunter who claims to have just shot a Sasquatch, starting \"The Birth of the Conservation Movement\"\u00a0mission, which has John try to hunt down six Sasquatches. After finding the sixth one however, John learns that his hunting has doomed the Sasquatches and the last one there asks John to kill him because his family is dead, whereupon John can choose to kill him or walk away, ending the mission.New Austin  If John decides to follow the \"Snake Oil Merchant\" lead, they will find Nigel West Dickens in Fort Mercer, trying to sell his elixir as a cure and repellent to the plague. John however forces Nigel to stop selling it, and Nigel complies. He hands out free samples to see if they like it. The elixir however is actually more of a bait to the infected, and one survivor is killed by several undead soon after drinking. Nigel is disappointed and asks John to find him five Desert Sage and five Violet Snowdrop to see if he can make a better cure. He also gives John some of the elixir to use as bait. After John finds the flowers, Nigel makes a phosphorus bullet coating with it, and then asks John to find him some old parts he needs. After John finds the parts, Nigel uses it for a Blunderbuss, telling John that it is the ideal weapon for undead killing. He also tells John that he is trying to get to Mexico and should be in Solomon's Folly in a few days. At Solomon's Folly, John finds out that all paths to Mexico are blocked, and that Nigel has no way of getting to Mexico. However, Nigel tells John that if he gets a US Army uniform from some deserters, he can sneak on a train manned by the US Army that is headed to Mexico. Nigel then leaves, leaving his ultimate fate unknown. If John decides to follow the \"Freak with a glass eye\" lead, they will find Seth in The Old Bacchus Place, playing cards with an undead Moses Forth. John asks Seth if there's a cure to the plague, and Seth tells him to clear the graveyards. After John clears out three graveyards and goes back to Seth, Seth tells him that the cause of all this has something to do with the Aztecs, and tells him to head down for Mexico if he wants to cure the plague. At MacFarlane's Ranch, John meets Bonnie MacFarlane, who tasks him with trying to find her father, Drew MacFarlane in the barn, although she tells him he has been in there for more than a day. After entering the barn through a window, John kills several of the trapped Undead within. Then, John finds Drew in the barn, zombiefied. John picks up the Winchester Repeater and is forced to kill Drew, where he then goes to Bonnie and tells her what happened, who is deeply saddened by the news. In Plainview, John finds D.S. MacKenna, who tells John to bring him a Retcher, because Mackenna desires to make a zombie movie. Once John does so however, Mackenna sets it and another undead loose. They then both proceed to attack Mackenna, who is turned undead. John then can kill all three of them. In Armadillo, John meets Marshal Leigh Johnson, and Johnson asks John to find Eli and Jonah, who have been missing for a few hours. John finds Eli eating Jonah, and they both attack John. John then has to kill them both, and tell Johnson the news, claiming that they both died with their \"bellies full\". Johnson also gives John a Sawed-off Shotgun. In Fort Mercer, John sees an Army Captain posting up a missing persons poster for Millicent Waterbury. The Captain asks John to find the girl, and John finds Millicent in Pleasance House, although undead are trying to attack her. After John saves Millicent, they head back to Fort Mercer and the Captain thanks John and tells him there's more missing persons if he wants to help them. If John heads to the deserters, he finds them being attacked by undead, he can either help them and earn the uniform, or steal it and suffer the consequences. After John has the uniform, he can head to the train, where he finds the US Army being lightly hassled by undead. After John helps them clear it out, they head to the border. At the border, the captain tells them all to get off and clear the roadblock. However, they are attacked by undead and the US Army retreats, leaving John to kill the undead. After he has dealt with them, John can man the train and smash through the roadblock into Mexico.Mexico  In Mexico, John finds that it is actually in worse shape than America, and he heads to Las Hermanas, where he meets the Mother Superior. She tells John that other nuns are not as resourceful as her, and that he needs to head inside Las Hermanas and save the town. After doing so, Mother Superior thanks John and he asks her why the plague is happening. She tells John that she needs a normal Undead to really find out. After John brings her a zombie, Mother Superior tells John that she suspects evil, and she pours holy water on the undead, who is briefly bathed in blue flame, but is not killed. She asks John if he can clear out the Sepulcro graveyard for her, and she gives him Holy Water. After he returns, Mother Superior tells him that a woman told her that the cause of all this is because of something Abraham Reyes has done. John\u00a0is then tasked with heading to Escalera and finding out what happened there. In Casa Madrugada, John meets Landon Ricketts, who is busy ridding the town of undead. Landon seems to be holding off all the undead by himself, and he tells John that if he can find something that attracts the undead, he can combine it with Dynamite and really kill the undead quick. After John brings Landon undead bait and Dynamite, Landon combines them and makes Boom Bait, after handing it to John, they part ways. In Escalera, John finds a woman, who tells him that Abraham Reyes is up ahead. John finds Reyes, however, he is now a zombie, and chasing a woman ( the same woman that can be seen in almost every cutscene). After John kills Reyes, the woman tells John that the cause of all this is because Reyes's lust for invulnerability made him steal an ancient Aztec mask, which unleashed the plague. They take the mask to the crypt where Reyes found it, and after John places the mask back in the altar the women reveals herself to be Ayauhteotl, an Aztec goddess. This action causes the undead to be returned to normal, and John heads home to his family.Epilogue  Upon heading back to Beecher's Hope, John finds that Abigail and Jack are fine, and they are happy again. About 2 months later, John is dead, and in Escalera Seth is shown stealing the ancient mask, causing all dead, including John, to return as undead. However, as John was buried with Holy Water, he returns as an undead with a man's soul, allowing him to still be playable.Content Single player Multiplayer Undead Nightmare Collection  The Undead Nightmare Collection is a single, stand-alone retail disc or downloadable content that bundles together the following content packs [1]: The Undead Nightmare Collection was released into retail stores everywhere for $29.99/\u00a324.99/\u20ac29.99, on November 23 2010 in North America, and November 26 in Europe.

Horseback riding features prominently in the mission \"End of the Line\", during which the player as Red Harlow must chase down a train commended by antagonist Javier Diego on a horseback; the player must jump back and forth between their mount and the moving train.Red Dead Redemption Overview  Horses are fast, adaptable, carry equipment and allow the rider to utilize weapons while riding. In-game horses come in a vast variety of breeds, appearances and colors; several of which have different pattern variations. Each breed has a different level of stamina, health, and speed. Horses in Red Dead Redemption are very realistic in their movement and behavior, reacting to their environment and exhibiting self-preservation instincts. For example, a horse will generally refuse to jump off a cliff despite attempts by the player to guide it over. In addition, they will become panicked when riding too close to the edge of steep drops. Horses may wander if they have not been tied and shy away from gunfire and animals, especially snakes, and will also get nervous and spooked by any potentially dangerous animals moving towards or that are near the player. Horses that have wandered away can be recalled to the player using the game's whistle function, which will prompt the horse to come to the player. If the horse does not trot to side, then it is likely that the horse has been killed or died. If the horse has died, continue on foot until finding another horse, or whistle after a time and a randomly selected horse will come up to you; if Marston has a horse deed, using the deed and whistling avoids the delay. (In multiplayer the same breed of horse will come). The player can lasso enemies from horseback and either hogtie or drag them (which eventually results in death), gun down foes from horseback or even trample them with the mount. Horses, just like the characters, will each have unique personalities, temperaments and performance characteristics. Horses can be killed in combat, by animals, by the player, and from falls. If the player is stranded in the wilderness without a horse, they are presented with a situation to attain one. All horses in the game have a certain level of stamina, represented by the blue bar to the left of the mini-map. Players must keep an eye on the stamina level - if it gets too low through constant spurring, the horse will slow, then become exhausted and buck the player off onto the ground. There are items that can be purchased from shops that will refill a horse's stamina (Apples and Horse Pills). Horses can jump over obstacles such as fences, and will jump automatically if going fast enough. Depending on where the player acquires a horse, there are varying levels of loyalty between them. Essentially, choosing to lasso a wild horse and break it in for riding, this horse may not be too kind on the idea and may buck the player off. However, after some time passes between the horse and Marston, the horse will learn to trust its rider, Apples are a good way to build trust. A loyal horse is much less likely to buck or rear, and whistling for it when it is stolen will cause it to buck the thief off and return to the player. Of course, the way players treat the horse will also play a role in their loyalty. Spurring a horse nearly to death, the horse may opt to buck off. The same goes for a horse that is forced to run for very long periods of time without any rest; a horse that is being ridden too hard will neigh in protest, which is a hint to ease off. Basically, don't allow horses to become jaded and they will have much more positive feelings towards you. The origins of horses also play a part in how much health the horse starts off with, i.e. a horse that was taken from a farm will have more health than a horse taken from a roaming gang. The player's \"trusty steed,\" established as Marston's own horse either by hitching it or by using a horse deed, has a brown saddle with small saddlebags and a blanket roll across the back. All other saddles in the game are black and lack the accessories. When a wild horse is broken, it will be shown without a bridle or saddle. However, once hitched, the horse will have Marston's brown saddle after the game is saved. All stolen or loaned horses will have a black saddle until hitched. After hitching, black-saddled or saddleless horses will remain so until they respawn, usually after the player gets far away from them or after a cutscene.Horse Power  Horses also provide the physical power for stagecoaches, wagons and carts. Between one to four horses pull the weight of vehicles of various weights, and at various speeds; these horses seem to be randomly assigned, and the horses present do not seem to affect the speed of the vehicle; regardless, it is impossible to change the horses hitched to a vehicle manually. The player can drive these horses by occupying the driver's seat of the trailers. Horses can break free if the vehicle is damaged.Domesticated vs. Wild  Wild horses react differently than domesticated horses, often gathering in small herds in the wilderness and running away from the player when approached. Some missions require the taming or breaking of a wild horse in order to domesticate them. The hunting statistics maintained in the game make a distinction between domesticated and wild horses, with the latter being required for the Unnatural Selection achievement/trophy while killing the former is counted as a crime.Acquisition  Horses, or rather the ability to spawn a particular breed of horse, can be purchased from ranchers/stores, in the form of deeds. One star horse deeds cost $100 ($50 with high honor, or low honor at Thieves' Landing.), two star horse deeds cost $500 ($250 with high or low honor), and three star horse deeds for $1,500 ($750 with high or low honor). To use a horse deed, open the Satchel, select the deed, then whistle, and the horse will run to the player. Note that although horse deeds are listed in the \"Consumables\" section of the satchel, a horse deed is never consumed and may be used over and over again. You aren't buying a horse so much as an unlimited supply of them. Using the horse deed causes the game to autosave, even if the horse is still alive. This is an easy way to save without having to search for a place to camp. If the player is riding a horse already, using the deed will cause the old horse to run away as soon as the player dismounts it; if they have a loyal horse nearby they are not riding, it will run away when the deed is used. Horses can also be stolen from hitching posts or by killing or forcibly dismounting the rider. The horse can then be ridden by the player. To make a stolen horse the player's \"trusty steed,\" it must be tied to a hitching post. An easy way to obtain a horse is to find a horse being ridden by an NPC, then simply push the horse (make sure your gun is put away) until the rider falls off. You can then mount the horse without any trouble. However, make sure that the rider is not a lawman, because then you will get a bounty. Another easy way is to find a hitched horse, and again, push the horse, and the horse will be unhitched. Again, you can mount the horse without any trouble. Sometimes, NPC's will get bucked off, or horses will be left standing after gunfights. The horses from these situations can be taken. Cart horses can also sometimes be found alive and taken after the cart is destroyed. Wild horses can be captured and tamed. As with stolen horses, they must subsequently be hitched before becoming the player's trusty steed. The easiest way to get a horse in many towns is to find the horse corral, if there is one, and take a horse. In places like MacFarland's Ranch, there are horse with bridles but not saddles, like wild horses the player has just broken. These can be taken without a bounty. Other places include Thieves Landing, Warthington Ranch, and several others.Horse Taming  The player is able to capture and tame wild horses for later use. Some settlements also offer the player the opportunity to tame horses as an activity.Hunting  Wild horses can be hunted, but killing domesticated horses counts as a crime. When either kind of horse is killed, they can be skinned and their meat and hide sold for cash.Animals  Although the horses are strong in Red Dead Redemption, there are certain animals that you need to be aware of. Bears and Cougars can kill your horse if they get too close, as to try to knock you off and get to you. The majority of horses (with few exceptions) will die in a single hit from cougars and bears, so if you are in the Great Plains or Tall Trees, watch out for them. Wolf packs can tear through your horse quickly, so ride a safe distance away and dismount, as they may kill the steed while you are still on. Coyotes will not attack the player while on horseback, so pose no danger. Boars can quickly dispatch the horse of an inattentive player.Breeds  The different breeds of horses in the game are categorized by stars. One star horses are the worst, and are jaded, or sick. Two star horses are the most common to encounter in the world. One and two star horse deeds can be bought at any time. Each area has a 3-star horse breed: the American Standardbred in West Elizabeth, the Kentucky Saddler in New Austin, and the Hungarian Half-bred in Mexico. Each of these three horses must be broken before their deeds can be purchased.Multiplayer  In multiplayer, horses are unlocked by the player by reaching certain multiplayer ranks. Five horses can be unlocked: Once unlocked, the horse can be set as the player's chosen mount in the Outfitter. This is equivalent to hitching a horse in single player. Horses that have not been unlocked can be stolen from other players or NPCs, but can not be made the player's \"trusty steed\" as in single player (whistling will always bring the mount chosen in the Outfitter).Undead Nightmare  Horses are basically the same as they were in Red Dead Redemption; however, when the player's horse is killed and the player whistles for another too soon an Undead Horse will appear. The Undead Horse cannot be killed without explosions, headshots, Fire Bottles or Holy Water. Undead Horses have unlimited stamina but will not obey Marston until he is undead. When Marston becomes undead, all uninfected horses will do the same as undead horses did pre-Marston's infection and will not obey him. They are also one of the very few undead animals that do not attack living creatures. Undead Horses can be found and obtained the same way their living counterparts were in Red Dead Redemption.Red Dead Redemption 2  While horses continue to be gamified in Red Dead Redemption II, their impact on the game and players has been expanded. The more players ride, groom, and feed their horse, the stronger their bond becomes and the more abilities the horse gains, such as quick cornering and dressage. This is critical for the horse becoming more comfortable in precarious situations like shootouts and coming across predators. If the bond is weak, the horse may throw players off its back and flee from the threat, taking supplies and weapons with it. If a horse dies, the whole process needs to be started over again with another horse. Horses are far more likely to collide with objects within the world in Red Dead Redemption II, usually knocking off the rider, as exampled here. There are 19 breeds of horse from Appaloosas and Arabians to Shires to Mustangs, each of which handles differently with its own defined characteristics. Horses can be captured and broken out in the wild, purchased from stables, or acquired by more underhanded means. With 59 different styles of coat, and a huge range of customizable tack, including saddles, horns, stirrups, and spurs, players can create a horse that is truly their own. Tonics can also provide horses with temporary stamina boosts. While standing idle, horses will snap at flies, moves their ears around if they're hearing something, and defecate. If it is a male, his testicles will tighten and drop according to temperature.Breeds Types  The type of horse in Red Dead Redemption 2 will have an affect on the horses stats. These stats are represented by white bars, with seven being the natural maximum without any stat boosting items like stirrups.Tips Redemption Redemption II Bugs Trivia Red Dead Redemption Red Dead Redemption 2 Achievements  The taming and riding or killing of horses are included in the completion of the following five available achievements/trophies:References Activities in Redemption  In Red Dead Redemption, there are a number of activities that the player can do when not on a mission. These can range from gambling to jobs to Random Encounters. Rockstar Games has stated that they wanted to really provide gamers with something that would keep them interested, when traversing the game world. They can be a large variety of things, some involving the player, some involving separate AI, some in which the player can get involved, or just keep on walking and ignore it.List of Activities Redemption Multiplayer  Multiplayer in Red Dead Redemption consists of multiple game modes, and allows players to play co-operatively (with the Outlaws to the End DLC) or competitively through an online connection.  Red Dead Redemption multiplayer does not have a traditional \"game lobby\": instead, it starts out in Free Roam mode, with the entire map open for exploration, along with Hunting areas (with the Legends and Killers DLC) and Gang Hideouts of which players can take advantage of. From there, players can establish player parties with other players, called Posses, or choose to participate in various game modes via the in-game menu or various entry points around the game world. There are various Multiplayer Glitches that affect Gameplay.Game Modes  There are several game modes in Red Dead Redemption's multiplayer:Free Roam  Free Roam is the entry point into multiplayer where you are free to go nearly anywhere in the world with up to 15 other players. This is also where you can pick your unique Character, Mount, and title in the Outfitter. Players are also able to band together and form Posses of up to 8 players. In these Posses you can take on other Posses and have a gang fight. During Free Roam you can take part in gang hideouts, one of the quickest ways of ranking up in online multiplayer of Red Dead Redemption. Along with gang hideouts, there are hunting grounds scattered throughout the world that you can gain xp from and complete various challenges. You can press the SELECT/BACK button to open up a menu where you can join posses, invite friends, or switch gametype. There are three modes of Free Roam: Normal, Hardcore, and Friendly. Players cannot kill other players in Friendly mode (other than with an ingenious way of stealing their Mount on a cliff), but they can in Normal and Hardcore. In Hardcore mode, expert targeting is required.Competitive Modes  In competitive game modes, the gameplay begins with either a Mexican standoff in Free For All, with all the players beginning in a circle, or a team face-off, with all players in their respective team's line facing the other team. There will be a short countdown, then a firefight will commence, in which all the players will all start shooting at once. Most players will die right off, allowing the remaining players to find a choice location (such as a sniping spot) to fend off their attackers. Once the standoff ends, and everyone from one team dies, the actual game you are playing (Gang Shootout, Hold Your Own, Grab the Bag, etc.) starts. There are also a variety of weapons to be found in chests around the map. During \"gang\" matches players will be assigned a player model, but during Free for All matches and in Free Roam, players will be allowed to use their chosen model. The player's selected mount is only usable in some game modes, and in team based matches all players will be assigned one type of horse to keep the game fair. Guns are also assigned to any game type except \"Free Roam\", in any competitive game mode players are assigned a pre-determined set of guns for the round, to get an idea of what guns you will receive, look to the dummy in the pre-game lobby. If you unlock a gun by leveling up it will be available to you in Free Roam.Cooperative Mode  Cooperative play was introduced with the Outlaws To The End DLC, and you must download it to be able to play this mode; however, the DLC is free. In Cooperative mode, a group of up to four players will work as a team through one of the six missions available. If a player's health drops to the point of dying, they will begin bleeding out and be unable to shoot or move. They will have a certain amount of time, as represented above their heads, before they bleed out. During this time, a teammate must revive them or they will die. If a player dies, they will be out of the game and forced to spectate a teammate until the next checkpoint,which are usually frequent, is reached. Players choose a loadout in the pre-game lobby, by walking up to a gun set, represented by a dummy, and selecting the one they want as their weapon set; there are four loadouts available (Miner, Soldier, Marskman, Gunslinger) The weapons they choose will be with them throughout the mission, however they can pick up weapons from fallen enemies as well. Players retain their selected player model. If the player beats all six missions, they will unlock Advanced Cooperative Mode. This mode is fixed to expert targeting, players take damage easier and bleed out faster. However Advanced Cooperative Mode has the \"No Holds Barred\" loadout, which allows the player to use all the weapons they have unlocked by leveling up throughout mulitplayer.Multiplayer Maps  In Free Roam, you can move in the whole game world but in PvP (competitive mode), there's limited map areas where matches take place. The maps which come along with the game are: Legends and Killers maps:Gang Hideouts  Gang Hideouts are the fastest method of gaining experience while in Free Roam. The faster the player completes a hideout, the more XP is gained. Other factors also go into the player's XP gain. Gang hideouts can be completed alone or with a posse. The most common gang hideouts that are played in multiplayer are Solomon's Folly and Twin Rocks. These two are regarded as the fastest and easiest hideouts to complete, resulting in a fast XP gain. After the patch released on June 12th, however, XP awarded for gang hideouts has been decreased. (There used to be a method to get the amount of XP you used to get before the patch. You would clear your Xbox 360's cache, which deletes all patches, and use system link to gang hideout farm. For PS3, you would just go into \"Game Data Utility\" delete the patch, start up the game, decline the update, and play multiplayer using LAN. However, this no longer works, as Rockstar made it so that if you delete the patch, it will automatically delete your multiplayer data as well, resulting in you returning to level 1.) While the two above hideouts are reported as the fastest hideouts, it is more common for newer players to repeat runs of Tumbleweed. This is due to how close it is to the starting areas of Armadillo, MacFarlane's Ranch, or even Thieves' Landing. It is common for higher level players to do repeated runs of Tesoro Azul, due to the relatively low difficulty and being a moderately fast gang hideout.Titles  During the multiplayer game experience, whether in Free Roam or structured game modes, players will be able to earn titles corresponding to criteria met during play. This can be anything from a certain amount of experience accrued to completing certain actions a number of times or in a specific way. Titles, once selected, will appear above the player's name on their in-game icon until the player decides to change it, which they can do at anytime. You keep all your titles when you pass into legend.Mounts  In the multiplayer of Red Dead Redemption, the player can choose the mount their character summons/rides in Free Roam and some competitive matches. The player changes their mount by visiting the Outfitter in the Multiplayer section of the pause menu. Different mounts become available only after achieving various online ranks. When the player ranks up and unlocks a new mount for use, their old mount is replaced by the new one even if the player hasn't visited the Outfitter yet. But in some rare occasions this doesn't happen. In successive legend modes, mounts are generally unlocked earlier as there are more mounts to unlock. Mounts that can be unlocked are: an * indicates legendary mounts. Several non-unlockable horses, such as the Kentucky Saddler or the Infested Ardennais can be found in multiplayer, in the wild or ridden by other people. These horses can be mounted, but will not respond to a whistle. This table shows the levels that you unlock each mount Dashes = cannot unlock this mount in this tier of legend.Challenges  In multiplayer, a large selection of challenges are available for players to complete. More challenges unlock as a player progresses through the ranking system. Completing a challenge earns the player experience. The status of each active challenge, found in the player's Journal, is indicated by a bar that progressively fills up as the challenge is accomplished. For example, if the challenge requires the player to shoot 5 rabbits for a Sharpshooter challenge, each rabbit shot adds to this indicator bar until all 5 have been shot. When a player reaches Rank 50 and agrees to return to Rank 1 to gain Legend status, all challenges will be reset. Any unlocked Titles associated with challenges previously completed will remain.Ranks  When playing multiplayer, a player can gain experience by killing other players, completing challenges, killing NPC's (citizens and police officers) and clearing hideouts. When the player gains enough experience to be promoted to the next rank, they can unlock new characters, weapons, mounts and titles. A player can be promoted through fifty ranks. After each level up the player gets a new badge.When they reach Rank 50, they have the option to return to Rank 1 to gain Legend status, similar to the 'Prestige' mode in Call of Duty. Legend mode builds towards unlocking legendary characters and mounts. They can do this up to five times in addition to the original ranks, which means a player could progress through a total of 250 ranks to reach the highest level in multiplayer. Once entering legend the player will get a legend badge a new character and a new mount at level fifty. Once at Rank 50, a player can choose to gain Legend status at any time afterwards. The following confirmation messages are displayed when gaining Legend status:  \"PASS INTO LEGEND\" \"Your rank will reset from 50 back to 1 in exchange for the benefits of becoming a Legend. All weapons and mounts you have unlocked through leveling up will be lost and all challenges are reset. Your access to playlists, titles, golden guns and characters will remain the same. Would you like to become a Legend?\" \"There is no undoing this change once you commit to it. You will lose your weapons, mounts, and challenge progress, but in exchange will get access to special Legendary characters and the right to earn Legendary mounts. Passing into Legend only occurs in Free Roam. Are you really sure you want to do this?\" As of 12 June 2010, Gang Hideout XP has been severely decreased, up to 2/3 of what it once was. Owing to the vast amount of XP required to reach Legend 5, it is recommended to remain at Rank 50 once attained as becoming a Legend only gives the variety of different mounts/characters/titles/rank icon, with the Legendary mounts being poorer than the American Standardbred in terms of speed/agility. The one exception to this is the zebra donkey which is unlocked upon reaching the highest legendary rank.Weapons (Multiplayer)  All weapons available in single player are available in multiplayer game sessions. While the hunting knife is available in multiplayer, other equipment, such as the lasso, bandolier, and binoculars are not. When joining a session, players have a set of weapons determined by multiplayer rank and some ammunition for each gun in their possession. Additional weapons can be obtained by picking them up from dead players/NPCs and weapon crates (shown on the in-game minimap as a pistol icon). Increasing a player's rank will immediately place any weapons unlocked into the players possession. When a player dies in a multiplayer game session, they respawn with all the weapons in their possession when they died. The amount of ammunition in each weapon set to a default amount, similar to if they had just joined the game. Ammo crates are also scattered throughout the environment (they look like bullets on the mini-map).All Unlocks  For a list of all the unlocks, see Rank Unlocks in Redemption Multiplayer.Characters  In multiplayer you can choose your character model in the Outfitter. For now, there are 15 categories of characters, each based on characters taken from the single player game: Note: There is an issue with the multiplayer characters \"Jesse Lange\" and \"Jefe Rocha\". Despite their different names and being put in different categories, they are the same character skin and speak spanish as well regardless of which list you choose the skin from. It is not known whether this is a glitch or if it is intentional. Many of the characters are available from the start (Level 1) which gives the player a good amount of choice when choosing one to start off with. When starting a new multiplayer campaign the player will also be randomly assigned one of these characters. The characters that are available from level 1 are as follows:Updates GameSpy Shutdown  With the closure of GameSpy's servers undergoing, Redemption's stats will no longer be saved onto Social Club. The in-game leaderboards will be removed for PlayStation 3 players only as of now.Downloadable Content Outlaws To The End Legends and Killers Liars and Cheats Undead Nightmare Multiplayer Achievements  There are several achievements/trophies that can only be completed by participating in multiplayer game modes:100% Completion  100% Completion is an accomplishment in Red Dead Redemption that unlocks an achievement/trophy and an outfit.Overview  100% Completion is achieved when a set of designated tasks has been completed. The following list provides the specific requirements for achieving 100% completion. This accomplishment applies to the main game - the Undead Nightmare DLC has a separate 100% completion accomplishment covered under the achievement/trophy entitled \"Zed's Dead, Baby.\"Tracking Progress  The walkthrough below, details everything that needs to be accomplished to achieve 100% Completion. There are a few ways the player can keep track of their progress in each of the required tasks:Walkthrough  The requirements for 100% Completion come from eleven different aspects of gameplay as detailed in the subsections below.Main Missions  Each of the 57 story missions that is completed counts as 1%, for a total of 57%.Rare Weapons  Each of the five rare weapons that are acquired from a Gunsmith counts as 0.5%, for a total of 2.5%.Outfits  Each of the nine required outfits that is unlocked counts as 0.5%, for a total of 4.5%. Only the outfits listed below are required for 100% completion.Job Locations  Each job that is completed at one of the five unique locations (once per location) counts as 0.5%, for a total of 2.5%.Safehouses  (Rental properties and Pleasance House are excluded.) Obtaining all thirteen safehouses is worth a grand total of 2%, meaning each safehouse is worth 2/13 of a percent, or roughly .1538%, however since the percentage is rounded to the nearest tenth, some will appear as being worth .1%, and some as .2%. Note that the Safehouses must be purchased so that the icon changes from blue to green. A safehouse count can be quickly checked in Stats under \"General,\" after the list of hideout completion times.Gang Hideouts  Each of the seven gang hideout that is cleared (at least once) counts as 0.5%, for a total of 3.5%. The PS3-used-to-be-exclusive hideout, Solomon's Folly, does not count towards 100% completion.Ambient Challenges  Each ambient challenge is divided into two halves (ranks 1 to 5 and 6 to 10). Each half of each of the four challenges counts as 1%, for a total of 8%. The Tomahawk Mastery and Explosive Rifle Mastery Challenges added by the Legends and Killers DLC do not count towards 100% completion.Bounty Locations  Each of the twenty locations at which a Bounty Target is successfully captured or killed (and the prisoner or evidence of his death successfully returned) is worth 0.1%, adding to a total of 2.0% towards 100% completion. For 100% completion, eight bounty locations must be completed in New Austin, eight in Nuevo Paraiso and four in West Elizabeth. Note: It is possible to need 9 bounties in New Austin and only 7 in Nuevo Paraiso, plus the four in West Elizabeth. Bounty total for each location can be viewed at the bottom of (score) in the players (stats) menu. After completing a location, new bounties will continue to be posted for the same location, but only one successful completion is needed/counted for 100% completion. Bounties are placed at approximately 7:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. in any of the major settlements, although some postings have been observed at other times. The player should be in the town or settlement where the bounty is to be posted (i.e. in Armadillo if going after a New Austin bounty) prior to the posting time. At this time, a lawman will come and post the wanted poster (this may take a moment, depending on how close the Safe House is). In order for the bounty to count, the on-screen message about capturing the target dead or alive must be displayed. If sniping from far away, the bounty may not count. Eight New Austin Bounties are posted at Armadillo, Rathskeller Fork, and MacFarlane's Ranch. Eight Nuevo Paraiso Bounties are posted at Escalera, El Presidio, and Chuparosa. Four West Elizabeth Bounties are posted at Blackwater and Manzanita Post.Stranger Missions  Completion of 18 of the 19 available Stranger missions counts for 0.5% each, for a total of 9%. (The \"I Know You\" mission does not count toward 100% completion)Minigames  Each of the six minigames that the player wins counts as 0.5%, for a total of 3%. For each minigame to be counted towards the 100% completion stat, the player must beat all players at the event (in line or at the table). For example, to complete Arm Wrestling the player must beat the person at the table as well as any people in line after him. Each game only needs to be won at a single location. For blackjack you have to leave the table with more chips than when you started, because you can't \"win\" blackjack. All of the following minigames are needed to obtain an outfit. Combining the two tasks speeds up the overall process of acquiring 100% completion.Map Locations  Discovering all 94 map locations counts for a total of 6%. This also accomplishes the On the Trail of de Vaca achievement/trophy. Locations can be \"found\" by just buying maps and pressing \"Use\" on them Three locations sometimes fail to register as \"found\" even after purchasing and using the appropriate maps: Repentance Rock, Tanner's Span and Mason's Bridge. The former is a cluster of steep rock formations in the middle of Rio Bravo (west-north-west of Fort Mercer); the latter two are railway bridges located to the southwest and southeast, respectively, of the Pacific Union Railroad Camp. Manually journeying to these locations (and crossing the bridges) will unlock the locations and count towards 100% completion rate. Some may have trouble locating The Old Bacchus Place given it is mistakenly placed in Diez Coronas in the fold-out and in-game maps. It is actually located right along the river in Hennigan's Stead.Tips and Tricks Glitches Achievements/Trophies  Achieving 100% Completion unlocks the following achievement/trophy:Master Hunter Challenges  Master Hunter Challenges are gameplay challenges which involve hunting and skinning specific animals in the single-player of Red Dead Redemption. This challenge will be initiated simply by finding a coyote, killing and then skinning it.Challenges Rank 1  This cannot be done in the Bonnie MacFarlane mission \"New Friends, Old Problems\", but may be done immediately after the quest.Rank 2  Bucks do not count as deer. They can be distinguished by antlers and body size; the latter having no antlers and a smaller build. Deer are most easily found in Cholla Springs.Rank 3  Only the killing hit counts for this challenge, so you can weaken the wolves with a gun first.\u00a0The killing and skinning are separate requirements. they don't have to be the same wolves. It is helpful to work on this challenge while riding a horse. This way, a wolf can be killed by one slice of the knife while the player is safe from attack. Also, watch out for additional wolves spawning as you skin the first set. It's prudent, after a knife kill, to use a horse deed from your satchel: this forces the game to autosave without the need to camp or the passage of six hours. If Marston dies before saving, any wolves killed since the last save are lost and have to be done over.Rank 4  A great boar spawn is on the Hennigan's Stead side of Tanner's Span railroad bridge. Be careful: it is also a cougar, wolf, and fox spawn. Use\u00a0bait\u00a0and an effective close-range gun like the\u00a0Semi-auto Shotgun. Boars tend to only appear in the early morning and the mid-afternoon. It is very rare to have them appear at night. Note that while the in-game description says five tusks are required, in reality kill and skinning five boars is sufficient, even if five tusks aren't collected. Armadillos will be obliterated by high-powered weapons and thus wouldn't be able to be skinned. Use a revolver or repeater instead.Rank 5  Like Rank 3, only the killing hit has to be with the knife. They can be weakened with a gun first. Also, the skinned cougars don't have to be the same ones killed with the knife. A very quick method to kill the cougars is to shoot them in the back just above the hind legs with the High Power Pistol. It will typically run after shot so wait until it attacks again and dodge the attack with a roll, then stab it.\u00a0 While cougars are strong on the attack, they can't take much damage. Two slashes from a knife will kill them. Because of how aggressive cougars are and how close you have to get, using an expendable horse and medicine are advisable. You can use Dead-Eye with your knife, and if timed correctly you will be immune to the cougar's attack and you'll be able to get in a slash or two before your Dead-Eye meter drains out. It is advised to have plenty of chewing tobacco and snake oil so you can quickly refill your Dead-Eye meter and repeat the process before the cougar makes another attack. After completing this challenge, the Buffalo Rifle becomes available for purchase from any Gunsmith.Rank 6  All these animals can be found around Beecher's Hope. Start at dusk and ride around inside the perimeter fence. Skunks and Raccoons can be easily found riding around Warthington Ranch at night.Rank 7  Elk can only be found in Tall Trees, usually quite deep in, past Manzanita Post, or near the river. They also spawn up where it snows. Look out for wolves, bears and possibly boars when searching for them. They can be killed in any way. Bighorn sheep can be found\u00a0in Tall Trees, usually near where the railroad meets the trees, to the south-west of Manzanita Post. They can also be found in New Austin in the northern hills, east of Rathskeller Fork.Watch out though, as that is also where cougars, snakes and wolves may spawn. They can be killed in any way. Bighorn sheep are known to appear in large numbers in the Twin Rocks gang hideout upon \"overkilling\" successive completion of clearing out these bandits.Rank 8  Like Rank 3 and 5, only the killing hit counts for this challenge. The killing and pelt collection are separate requirements. They don't have to be the same bear. Use the same technique used to kill the cougar, though it takes three or four body shots to weaken a Grizzly. Then, Lasso the bear after several body shots. When letting it go, the bear will run. This will give the opportunity to knife it without being attacked, though the bears are fast, making it difficult to chase them on foot. Try to use a horse for extra speed. Before using the knife for the finishing blow, suggested weakening techniques include: Once the bear has been weakened, it's still no easy job to knife it. When it is charging towards you,\u00a0target it with a knife and then roll out of the way once it gets too close. This is also a good way to kill other animals with a knife. Also, if possible when trying to knife the bear, hang back a bit and it will soon go onto its rear legs and stand up. This means that it cannot turn around as fast, which then gives the opportunity to go behind it and slash it. If players are lucky enough to encounter only one bear at a time, lasso it when it is near. The bear will be temporarily stunned, allowing time to switch to a knife via the start menu and slash its side a few times. Bears can't enter buildings, so you can hide in a cabin at Bearclaw Camp when a bear is chasing you. The bear cannot come in, and you should be able to kill it without it being able to kill you. Bears chasing NPC's in random encounters\u00a0will ignore you while the NPC is alive, so that is a convenient time to attack.\u00a0 Another way of killing the bear is shooting it a couple times then on horseback using your melee knife to kill it. One convenient method of completing the challenge is to wander around the woods of Tall Trees immediately to the west of Beecher's Hope to trigger the spawning of a bear. Then, catch the bear's attention and lure it back to Beecher's Hope while on horseback. Once inside the boundary fence, bears become far less aggressive, preferring to run away rather than attack, meaning you can weaken it with a few rounds and then finish it off with the knife without too many problems. It might knock you down occasionally, but it will leave you alone long enough to recover, unlike out in the wild. The other advantage to this method is there isn't the risk of another bear spawning nearby to take you by surprise. The easiest way to attain this rank is to wait for the mission \"At Home with Dutch\". A bear is encountered a few steps up after starting to climb the rocks. Shoot it three times with the Bolt Action Rifle, lasso it, then stab it. It has limited space so is easy to kill and no other animals will attack. Also, circling the tree at the back of the clearing can give you extra stabs at the bear, without the risk of it charging and mauling you.The checkpoint can be restarted if the bear kills you. To make it even easier, shoot and kill the bear ouright, climb to the next checkpoint, killing the cougar then commit suicide. Restart from checkpoint and go back down the path to the bear. It is completely docile and will not attack even when being punched.Rank 9  When you encounter Khan, text will appear on the screen and\u00a0he will appear as a red mark on your HUD.Rank 10  As in the previous challenge, when you find a legendary animal,\u00a0text will appear on the screen and it will appear as a red mark on your\u00a0HUD. Legendary animals tend to show up promptly upon entering their spawning zone. If you kill one of these targets but don't collect the pelt, you can try again later. They will respawn. Also, if the carcass is lost into deep water, the pelt and other collectibles may be automatically added to your inventory.Rewards  Successful completion of Master Hunter: Rank 5 will unlock the Buffalo Rifle for purchase from a Gunsmith. Successful completion of Master Hunter: Rank 10 allows creation of vittles after skinning an animal. Unlike the Sharpshooter Challenges, there is no congratulation text or journal log for completing this challenge.Trophies/Achievements  Completing the Master Hunter Challenges contributes to the following Trophies/Achievements:Treasure Hunter challenges  Treasure Hunter challenges are a set of challenges in Red Dead Redemption, unlocked through treasure maps to find hidden treasures.Description  The treasure locations are spread all across the land of Red Dead Redemption. Treasure comes in two forms: In order to find a treasure, the player must obtain a Treasure Map, decipher it, and travel to the location depicted. The player obtains the first treasure map from a random event with a treasure hunter (Chu Fook) being attacked by bandits. Once the player saves the treasure hunter or loots his corpse, the player obtains the first treasure map. This is a random encounter and can happen at many different locations and times, both early and later in the game. Completing the encounter also gives the player Rank 1 of the treasure hunter challenge. Each subsequent map is found as a part of the previous map's treasure. (Map 2 found in Map 1 treasure, Map 3 found in Map 2 treasure, etc.) The player starts at Treasure Hunter Rank 1 and must find the treasure on the Rank 1 Treasure Map to advance to Rank 2. Once Rank 5 is achieved, the player may ride Stagecoaches free of cost. Once Rank 10 is achieved, the player is awarded 150 fame and given the Treasure Hunter's satchel, which allows for twice as many Consumables to be carried. Note: The player must have the map to find the treasure. For example, the treasure at Hanging Rock can't be grabbed without Treasure Map #1 It is in the environment but without the map, no interaction occurs. This video shows where all 9 treasures are located. For more detailed walkthroughs check out the videos below each Rank's map explanation.Rank 1  Reward:Rank 2  Head to The Hanging Rock at the crossroads north of Armadillo. The treasure map depicts the front and back of The Hanging Rock. Simply travel around to the back of The Hanging Rock so that you are facing the mountains, as depicted on the map. This video shows where to find it. Contains:Rank 3  Head to Rio Del Lobo, more specifically, Del Lobo Rock. When heading south into the area, follow the main road that climbs the ridge leading to the river. When the roads end at the campsite, face the river to see the gap in the ridge indicated on the treasure map. The treasure is on the other side of the rock, on a ledge. To get to it, go around the right side of the rock then keep left as you descend. Two or three \"falls\" later, you'll find the pile of rocks on a dirt ledge. If you get all the way down to the beach, you've gone too far. This video shows where to find it. If you hire a stagecoach to take you to end of the road at Rio Del Lobo, the driver will drop you on the Mexican side of the river in Perdido, necessitating a long ride back across the border. Contains:Rank 4  Located in the basement of the mansion in Tumbleweed. It is not difficult to find because it is under a pile of stones with a cow skull on the wall above it. Note: Upon subsequent visits here (the first visit was part of a mission) there will be more gang members and a sheriff who you must rescue. On the back side of the mansion are a set of doors down a short flight of stairs that lead directly into the basement. Sneaking up to the left side of the mansion from a different path leading into Tumbleweed, then going into the back of the mansion will avoid ANY form of a fight with gang members. This ensures that the player can go in and out without a trouble in the world. This video shows where to find it. Contains:Rank 5  Can be found along the river bank in Rio del Toro, which is northwest of Chuparosa. Look for a tree about 15 meters (50 feet) inland adorned with cattle skulls.

It is the fastest horse breed and mount available in the base game; in exchange, its overall health and stamina are average in comparison to the other two top-tier breeds. Described as a \"black horse\" in its deed, the American Standardbred is dark brown, almost solid black, in color, with a full black mane and tail.Deed  A deed for this horse can be purchased at any general store for $1500 but mostly for 750 with high enough honor (or low enough honor at Thieves' Landing), but only after the player has successfully broken the horse at least once.Locations  The American Standardbred can be found in the following locations: Rare occurrences have taken place where the American Standardbred has also been found north of Wreck of the Serendipity. Groups of two American Standardbreds can also be found near Aurora Basin, though such occurrence is rare. On extremely rare occasions, this horse has been reported galloping with the Hungarian Half-Bred and the Kentucky Saddler. This is either a game bug or a spawn code error.Multiplayer  In multiplayer-mode, the horse is unlocked at level 40 and can be selected by the player in the Outfitter.Tips Trivia Achievement  The player is required to tame an American Standardbred to complete the following trophy/achievement:John Marston  John Marston is a central character and the main protagonist of Red Dead Redemption and Undead Nightmare and secondary protagonist in Red Dead Redemption 2. With the addition of the Liars and Cheats DLC pack, John Marston is also a multiplayer character model that may be selected in the \"Redemption\" section of the Outfitter. With the addition of the Undead Nightmare DLC pack, an Undead version of him, known as Zombie Marston, is a Multiplayer character model that may be selected in the \"Zombies\" section of the Outfitter.History Background  John Marston was born in 1873. His father was an illiterate Scottish immigrant, who was born on the boat into New York, while his mother was a prostitute, who passed away during John's birth. John's father was blinded in both eyes during a bar fight south of Chicago. His father loved to talk about Scotland and hated the English for what they did to his great-grandparents, although he never met them. In 1881, John's father died. John was only\u00a0eight years old at the time and was sent to an orphanage, where he spent the next few years. He eventually ran away and tried to make his own luck living out in the streets. At the age of eleven, John committed his first murder when he shot a man to death, though he claimed it was not his fault. In 1885, at the age of 12, Marston had been caught stealing by homesteaders in Illinois, who planned on hanging him. Dutch van der Linde stepped in and saved the young boy, taking him under his wing. John joined the Van der Linde gang alongside Hosea Matthews, Arthur Morgan, and Susan Grimshaw. The gang became a surrogate family to the young boy, with Dutch becoming his mentor and father figure. He taught John how to shoot, hunt, gather, read, and instilled him with a love of nature and things other than power. John had become an outlaw and gunslinger. He ran with Dutch, Bill Williamson, Arthur Morgan, Javier Escuella, and several others, committing robberies, raids, murders, kidnappings, and other crimes across the frontier. Marston, alongside Morgan, quickly became one of Dutch's proudest proteges. Many members of the gang considered John to be Dutch's favorite and \"golden boy\", much to the envy of certain people, such as Bill. Marston had fallen under the sway of Dutch's philosophy, believing that the gang stole and fought for a reason. In stealing from the rich, they in turn gave to the poor. They wanted to elicit change in the people of the West, although he later came to admit that these were excuses to let them rob and steal indiscriminately. In 1894, a prostitute named Abigail Roberts joined the gang. Despite having sexual relations with most of the gang members, she eventually fell in love with John. Together they had a son named Jack. The gang became an extended family to Jack, with most of the members becoming aunts and uncles to him. In his early years John had a lot of difficulty connecting with his son due to doubts as to whether or not he's Jack's biological father as well as fears about his own ability to raise him. Around the time Jack was 1 year old, John left the gang for a year. His return was met well with Dutch and certain other members of the gang, whilst Arthur Morgan felt betrayed by his actions. A rift between the two steadily grew over the next few years. The gang continued moving east until they reached Blackwater, where they decided to stay for awhile. They picked up new members such as Micah Bell and Charles Smith. Micah ended up encouraging Dutch to pursue a boat heist, which John participated in alongside Javier, the Callander brothers Mac and Davey, and Sean. The heist went wrong when a unit of Pinkerton agents ambushed the gang. Dutch shot a girl named Heidi McCourt in the head during the struggle. The gang escaped and managed to stash the money from the boat somewhere in Blackwater. The heist was a disaster, leading to the deaths of Davey and Jenny Kirk, Mac being separated, and Sean's capture by bounty hunters. John took a bullet in the leg and escaped with the rest of the gang heading north towards Big Valley.Events of Red Dead Redemption 2 Colter Chapter  After the botched ferry incident in Blackwater, the Van der Linde gang fled north. As they seek shelter in Colter, John and Micah, one of the gang's newest recruits, scout for shelter and supplies. However, Abigail gets concerned when John didn't return to their shelter. She pleads Arthur to find him along with Javier. Arthur and Javier manage to track John down and found him up in the mountains, badly injured and his horse killed. He revealed that he had gotten lost a day or so prior, ending up on a cliff near the peak of a mountain after being attacked by wolves which badly scratched his left cheek and nose, giving him permanent scars. They proceed to bring him back to safety, although Morgan was forced to fend off several wolves that had come after the trio while Escuella carried Marston on his horse. Once back at their temporary shelter, Abigail scolded Marston for his actions, and then was left to heal.Horseshoe Overlook Chapter  After recovering from his injuries, John along with Arthur, Charles, and Sean rob a train passing through Rhodes. The law shows up almost immediately, prompting suspicion from John, however they still manage make off with the money. John and Arthur then go and steal a herd of goats, to sell them at the Valentine auction. When they go to the nearby Saloon to drink after the success, Dutch and Strauss show up. Strauss and John go outside, and are captured by Cornwall and his guards. Arthur and Dutch rescue them, before riding off. They then pick up camp and leave.Clemens Point Chapter  John, along with\u00a0Javier\u00a0and Arthur make a deal with the\u00a0Grays,\u00a0in which they will steal the\u00a0Braithwaites\u00a0prized horses and sell them for five thousand dollars. The three of them talk their way into the grounds, before killing the stablehand and stealing the horses. John will take the lead during the escape, until they sell them for a meager seven hundred dollars. After Jack is kidnapped by the Braithwaites, John takes part in the assault against Braithwaite Manor in the hope of taking back his son. After his son is not at the manor, he grows furious.Saint Denis Chapter  John along with Arthur and Dutch go to Angelo Bronte's manor, who they learn is holding Jack hostage. In order to get him back, Arthur and John go deal with a group of men robbing graves in the citys cemetery. In exchange, Bronte gives back Jack. During the failed bank robbery in Saint Denis, John gets captured and sent to Sisika Penitentiary where he is incarcerated.Beaver Hollow Chapter  After Dutch and the remaining group traveled back from Guarma, Morgan and Sadie Adler scouted the penitentiary using a hot air balloon and manages to bust John out of prison where they returned to their camp in Beaver Hollow. However, Dutch berated Arthur and Sadie for getting John back earlier than intended. John and Arthur, on orders from Dutch blow up Bacchus Bridge. During this operation, John and Arthur decide to run away from the crumbling gang with Johns family, once they have the money. John joins the final robbery for the Van der Linde gang which involves robbing army payroll from a train. As they battle towards the front carriage, John gets shot by a train guard and falls off the platform. Dutch attempts to get John, but it is revealed that he left John to die after John confronts him about it back at camp. He then sides with Arthur against the rest of the gang. After Pinkertons show up, the two flee the area using the caves underneath the camp. Once they get out of the caves, Arthur will decide to stay with John or go back for the money. If you go with John, Arthur will eventually tell John to run while he holds off the Pinkertons.Pronghorn Ranch Chapter  Years after the gang disbanded, in 1907, the Marston family had an incident at Roanoke Ridge and heads to destination unknown. The family plan to lead a good, honest life after leaving Dutch. They arrived in Strawberry to try their luck there where Abigail and Jack land a job in the town clinic and John temporarily working for the general store, delivering goods to David Geddes at Pronghorn Ranch. John arrived at the ranch on time and manages to stop the Laramie boys harassing the ranch. After this, John receives work as a ranch hand for the Geddes. Their reunion with Abigail starts an uneasy friction after she receives news of John's actions prior their arrival. Nevertheless, Abigail and John manages to get by with their newfound life. John helps Mr. Geddes and ranch foreman Tom Dickens with more ranch work such as teaching the David Geddes' s younger son named Duncan Geddes how to tame and ride a horse, and build fences around the ranch. During these times, John briefly connects with Jack, teaching him how to ride a pony and retrieving mail from Strawberry. Their journey in getting packages at the post office was not easy after John and Jack were followed by people connected to the incident back at Roanoke Ridge. John is forced to kill them which triggers Jack's anxiety. After they return to their ranch, Abigail becomes increasingly worried after seeing Jack anxious and John failing his promise to her. This concern ignite after the Laramies attack the Pronghorn Ranch one night, stealing cattle. John and the ranch hands head to Hanging Dog Ranch where they successfully fight the gang and retrieve the cattle. John also kills their leader after mocking John's work. The event angered Abigail and left John quietly the morning after. John continues to work back at the ranch and after some time, Marston asks Mr. Geddes to put good faith on his name so that he can borrow loans from the bank and buy a plot of land at Blackwater. John attempts to buy Beecher's Hope to convince Abigail he's changed, with the intention of turning it into a ranch.Beecher's Hope Chapter  John successfully buys Beecher's Hope after clearing away squatters living there. He reunites with Uncle, Sadie and Charles, who help Marston build his ranch and provide him with jobs to pay off his bank loans. Abigail and Jack heads back to John after receiving the letter from him. John spends time with his family more such as fishing with Jack and Rufus, their dog, and going to Blackwater with Abigail. During their trip in the town, John proposes to marry Abigail by the lake. Eventually, Marston comes across information leading to Bell's location. He, Sadie, Charles go despite Abigail's pleas not to. In revenge for Morgan's death, Marston tracks down and confronts Bell, only to be shocked to see Dutch is with him. Upon seeing Marston, Dutch wounds Bell, opening the way for John to gun down Bell and takes his leave. Marston finds the gang's old money stash and uses it to fully pay off his loan. Afterwards, he formally marries Abigail, both looking forward to living a new life on their ranch. Sadie and Charles leave Beecher's Hope and the Marston family on good terms. Agent Ross, the newly appointed head of the Bureau of Investigation catches wind of the events on Mount Hagen and goes to investigate, finding nothing but Micah's corpse and no trace of the missing Blackwater money. Alongside his new subordinate, Archer Fordham, they begin a manhunt for the culprit, questioning various people until they discover John's location at Beechers Hope. John continues working on his ranch with his family for the next few years, unaware that his revenge against Micah had cost him his freedom.Events of Red Dead Redemption  Four years later in 1911, the old American West is dying. Encroaching technological advances such as railroads, telegram offices and stronger law enforcement begins to integrate themselves in western society. The federal government wants the Bureau of Investigation to aid in the process of civilizing the west by ridding the region of all of the savage gangs running wild and unchallenged, especially that of Bill Williamson and Dutch van der Linde. Not wanting to make martyrs out of them, Ross decides to use an ex-associate of Williamson's that the Bureau had been watching to hunt him down: former outlaw John Marston. By kidnapping John's wife and son, Ross forces him to comply. Thus, John is forced to roam the frontier once again to protect his family.New Austin  John arrives in Blackwater on the ferry \"Morningstar\" and is escorted by Edgar Ross and Archer Fordham through town to be sent off by train to Armadillo. Once there, John finds a guide named Jake hired by the local marshal in the saloon. The talkative guide questions Martson about his motives, but gets no answers in return. He leads John to the walls of Fort Mercer, the main hideout of the Williamson Gang. In confronting his old friend, Marston tries to reason with Williamson in giving up peacefully, but Williamson taunts John for his vocabulary, proudly proclaiming that he is now in charge of his own gang. John reaches for his revolver and gets shot in his lower right torso by one of Bill Williamson's outlaws. After suffering through the night and eventually passing out on the side of the road, Bonnie MacFarlane and her ranch hand Amos find John and take him to Nathaniel Johnston's doctor office in Armadillo. After treating his wounds, Bonnie provides John with lodging, food, and drink, on condition he helps her around the ranch. John works off his debt of $15 and his life to Bonnie and her father Drew MacFarlane by doing various ranch jobs such as night patrol, cattle-herding and horse-taming. However, Williamson finds out that John has survived and is staying at the MacFarlane Ranch, and\u00a0orders his gang to\u00a0set the barn on fire. John rescues the trapped horses and Bonnie promises to sell him some cattle when he settles on his ranch again. After assisting U.S. Marshal Leigh Johnson with various jobs in and around Armadillo, John and the Marshal begin to plan an assault on the fort. To gather a posse, John works with snake oil salesman Nigel West Dickens, and through him meets Irish and Seth Briars. However, their plans are temporarily delayed when Bonnie MacFarlane is kidnapped and John must help Marshal Johnson save her from being being hanged. After saving Bonnie, John and his allies carry out an assault on Fort Mercer, using a \"Trojan Horse\" strategy by sneaking John and a Gatling gun inside the fort in Dickens' wagon. West Dickens gives them a lecture about what is inside his \"miracle\" wagon, before rapping sharply on the side of the wagon to signal John, who shows himself and kills most of the outlaws while assaulting the fort. However, after the battle, the crew discovers that Williamson had fled the previous morning and went into hiding in the Mexican province of Nuevo Paraiso with Javier Escuella.Nuevo Paraiso  Irish escorts John south of the border to the Mexican province, Nuevo Paraiso, where he meets the region's provisional governor, Colonel Allende, and his subordinate right-hand man, Captain De Santa. He is forced to work for them to gain information on Williamson and Escuella. At the same time, John runs into the aging famed gunslinger Landon Ricketts who teaches him new gun fighting skills, and commits raids on the Mexican Army. Marston also aids Abraham Reyes and Luisa Fortuna-\u00a0two lover revolutionaries working to overthrow Allende and their president, General Sanchez, with numerous revolutionary attacks. He attempts to extract any information possible from both Allende and Reyes regarding the whereabouts of Williamson and Escuella. Allende, however, aware of John's loyalties, betrays John and has his men attempt to kill him. However,\u00a0Reyes and his rebels arrive in time and rescue John before he is executed. John then sides with Reyes and joins the revolution. After killing Captain De Santa and participating in an attack on El Presidio, Marston confronts Javier and echoes Dutch's statement about Angelo Bronte when he says \"It's either you or me. Way I see it, it might as well be you\". Javier is either killed or captured by John in the ensuing struggle. Eventually the rebels lead an attack on Allende's villa. Unfortunately, Luisa is gunned down by Allende's men. John and Reyes successfully manage to kill Allende and Williamson, who was seeking shelter and protection from the army. Reyes and his rebels take over the villa and plan on marching to Mexico's capital, fighting for revolution. John heads back to Blackwater in America to meet with Edgar Ross again.West Elizabeth  Though his business with Williamson and Escuella is over, Ross tells him that he still needs to kill Dutch van der Linde, former leader of John's old gang, or he will continue to keep his family in captivity. John, along with Ross, Fordham and other Bureau Agents meet in several fights across West Elizabeth against Dutch and his gang of Natives, but he escapes capture or death every time. Marston also works with incompetent Yale Professor Harold MacDougal and Native-American informant Nastas in tracking Dutch down. Eventually, John and the Bureau of Investigation join the American army in ambushing Dutch's hideout. He confronts Dutch himself, who warns John that the government will always find a new \"monster\" to justify their pay. Rather than dying or being taken captive by John's hand, Dutch chooses to commit suicide by falling from a cliff. After the raid, John is released by the government and finally reunites with his family at their ranch in Beecher's Hope. He settles down with his wife Abigail and sixteen-year-old son Jack, along with old family friend Uncle, and attempts to return to a crime-free life as a farmer and rancher with his family. However, as per Dutch's warning, Edgar double-crosses John. He, along with the Bureau and US Army, launches an attack on the Marston ranch. Uncle is killed during the gunfight, while John and his son continue holding off the attackers. John tells Abigail and Jack to run while he stays behind in the barn to defend them. Knowing that the chances of survival for John are slim, Abigail and John seal their love with a passionate kiss before the former rides off. In the end, John realizes that the only way to save his family from the government's crosshairs is to lay down his life so they can be free. John sacrifices himself in a last stand against Ross and his men. After exiting the barn calmly and standing before a large firing squad, he draws his pistol and takes out as many men as he can until they open fire on him. Still standing, breathing harshly with multiple bullet wounds on his body, he drops his revolver, falls to his knees and then eventually collapses backwards to the ground. As Ross watches Marston dying, he callously lights a cigar and is clearly satisfied with knowing that the final member of Dutch's gang is dead. Ross and his men leave the ranch. Abigail and Jack, upon hearing the cease-fire, return to find John's body in a pool of blood. They bury him up on top of the hill overlooking the ranch, alongside Uncle. His grave is inscribed \"Blessed are the Peacemakers.\"Epilogue  John's death at the hands of Ross is a poetic end to his life. His journey has been about what he would do for his family: He certainly kills for them, he helps swindle people in order to get at Bill Williamson, he works for both sides of the Mexican Civil War, he tortures a man with a prolonged beating to get information about Javier Escuella, he confronts the man who raised him, and in the end, he sacrifices himself to save his family so they could lead a better life - the reason he sought redemption in the first place. By his death, he knew that Ross wouldn't persecute Abigail or Jack any longer, allowing them to start life fresh, allowing Jack the chance to grow up without the brutality and violence that shaped John's early life. Sadly, despite his father's sacrifice, Jack possibly still goes on to become an outlaw; he tracks down and kills Edgar Ross in revenge, without hesitation. The path to redemption, it seems, is a hard road to follow. In 1914, three years after John was killed, Abigail dies from unknown causes. An older Jack, now a mirror image of his father, buries her body up on the hill next to John's grave. From then on, he is playable throughout the remainder of the game; retaining all of his father's weapons, clothes, money, horses, houses and fame/honor. The rest of Jack's life is shrouded in mystery.Events of Undead Nightmare  Note: The events of Undead Nightmare are not considered part of the same canon as Red Dead Redemption. The following description is therefore not contiguous with the preceding section on Red Dead Redemption.West Elizabeth  In Undead Nightmare, John Marston, the protagonist, is in his house with his wife, Abigail, and son, Jack. They are all talking about general things, like a book Jack is reading, however they mention that Uncle hasn't returned from what he was doing yet. John states that because of the storm, Uncle has probably sheltered in a dry place nearby and will stay there until the storm subsides. Uncle then arrives, hideous in appearance, and attempts to attack them. John heads to a nearby shed to grab his gun. When he returns, Uncle has bitten Abigail in the neck. John shoots Uncle in the head and tends to Abigail. Jack comes outside and tries to help his mother, but Abigail turns into an Undead because of the bite from Uncle and in turn she bites Jack, turning him undead as well. John then has to hogtie both of them, and after giving them both a plate of food, he leaves them in the house and sets out to find a cure. John goes to Blackwater, where he finds Professor MacDougal, who returned from Yale to document the undead infestation. MacDougal is killed by an undead Nastas, however, and John is forced to clear out Blackwater and look for more survivors. He finds a family on a roof, but as they're more interested in arguing with each other, they are of no help. John finds another group of survivors, who give him various theories for how the plague started, including a \"snake oil merchant\" and a \"freak with a glass eye\". If John goes to Tanner's Reach, he will meet a hunter who claims to have just shot a Sasquatch and makes him hunt the elusive creatures. Eventually, John learns that his hunting has doomed the Sasquatches and the last one there asks John to kill him because his family is dead. John can choose to kill him or not.New Austin  If John decides to follow the \"snake oil merchant\" lead, he will find Nigel West Dickens in Fort Mercer, trying to sell his elixir as a cure and repellent to the plague. John, however, forces Nigel to stop selling it, and Nigel, though annoyed by Marston's interference, complies and hands out free samples to see if they like it. The elixir, however, is actually more of a bait, and the drinker is killed by zombies soon after drinking. Nigel is disappointed and asks John to retrieve ingredients to see if he can make a better cure. He also gives John some of the elixir to use as bait. After John returns with the ingredients, Nigel makes a phosphorus coating with it, and then asks John to find him some old parts he needs. After John finds the parts, Nigel uses them to make a Blunderbuss, telling John that it is the ideal weapon for zombie killing. He also tells John that he is trying to get to Mexico and should be in Solomon's Folly in a few days. At Solomon's Folly, John finds out that all paths to Mexico are blocked, and that Nigel has no way of getting to Mexico. However, Nigel tells John that if he gets a U.S. Army uniform from some deserters, he can sneak on a train manned by the U.S. Army that is headed to Mexico. Nigel goes off and John doesn't meet him again. If John decides to follow the \"freak with a glass eye\" lead, he will find Seth Briars in The Old Bacchus Place, playing cards with an undead Moses Forth. John asks Seth if there's a cure to the plague, and Seth tells him to clear the graveyards. After John clears out three graveyards and goes back to Seth, Seth tells him that the cause of all this has something to do with the Aztecs, \"Or, or Incas\" and tells him to head down to Mexico if he wants to cure the plague. In MacFarlane's Ranch, John meets Bonnie MacFarlane, who tasks him with trying to find her father, Drew MacFarlane in the barn, although she tells him he has been in there for more than a day. John finds Drew in the barn, zombified. John is forced to kill Drew, and he goes to Bonnie and tells her what happened. In Plainview, John finds D.S. MacKenna, who tells John to bring him a Retcher, because MacKenna desires to make a zombie movie, aimed at \"the lowest common denominator\". Once John does so, MacKenna sets it and another zombie loose, and they both proceed to attack him, who is then turned into a zombie. John can kill all three of them. In Armadillo, John meets Marshal Leigh Johnson, and Johnson asks John to find Eli and Jonah, who have been missing for a few hours. John finds Eli eating Jonah, and they both attack John. John then has to kill them both, and tell Johnson the news. Johnson also gives John a Sawed-off Shotgun. In Fort Mercer, John sees an Army Captain posting up a missing persons poster for Millicent Waterbury. The captain asks John to find the girl, and John finds Millicent in Pleasance House, where zombies are trying to attack her. After John saves Millicent, they head back to Fort Mercer and the captain thanks John and tells him that there are more missing persons if he wants to help them. If John heads to the deserters, he finds them being attacked by zombies, he can either help them and earn the uniform, or steal it and suffer the consequences. After John obtains the uniform, he can head to the train, where he finds the U.S. Army being lightly hassled by zombies. After John helps them clear it out, the train heads to the border. At the border, the captain tells them all to get off and clear the roadblock. However, they are attacked by zombies and the U.S. Army retreats, leaving John to kill the zombies. After he has dealt with them, John can man the train and smash through the roadblock into Mexico.Nuevo Paraiso  In Nuevo Paraiso, John finds that Mexico is actually in worse shape than America, and he heads to Las Hermanas, where he meets the Mother Superior. She tells John that the other nuns are not as resourceful as her, and that he needs to head inside Las Hermanas and save the town. After doing so, Mother Superior thanks John and John asks her why the plague is happening. She tells John that she needs a normal Undead to really find out. After John brings her a normal Undead, Mother Superior tells John that she suspects evil, and she pours Holy Water on the zombie, who is briefly bathed in blue flame, but is not killed. She asks John if he can clear out the Sepulcro graveyard for her, and she gives him Holy Water. After he returns, Mother Superior tells him that a woman told her that the cause of all this is because of something Abraham Reyes has done. John is then tasked with heading to Escalera and finding out what's really causing all this. In Casa Madrugada, John meets Landon Ricketts, who is busy ridding the town of zombies. Landon seems to be holding off all the zombies by himself, and Landon tells John that if he can find something that attracts the zombies, he can combine it with dynamite and really kill the zombies quick. After John brings Landon bait and dynamite, Landon combines them and makes Boom Bait, after handing it to John, they say farewells and John leaves. In Escalera, John finds a woman, who tells him that Reyes is up ahead, John finds Reyes, however, he is zombified and is trying to kill a woman. After John kills Reyes, the woman tells John that the cause of all this is because Reyes' lust for invulnerability made him steal an ancient Aztec mask, and this is why the plague started. They take the mask to the crypt where Reyes found it, and after John places the mask back in the altar, the zombies are returned to normal and John heads home.Epilogue  Upon heading back to Beecher's Hope, John finds that Abigail and Jack are fine, and they are happy again. A few months later, John is dead. In\u00a0Escalera, Seth is shown stealing the ancient mask once again, causing the dead to rise again, including John Marston. However, as John was buried with Holy Water, he returns as an undead with a man's soul, allowing the player to still play as him.Character Personality  He has a strong dislike of birds and a rather dull imagination, especially when compared to his son\u00a0Jack.\u00a0When it comes to how he feels about religion, in-game quotes reveal that he is either an agnostic theist or a Christian, who is not too overtly religious.\u00a0 John is also extremely polite to women, often calling\u00a0Bonnie MacFarlane \"Miss MacFarlane\", even after she has asked him to call her \"Bonnie.\" He also does anything possible to keep women safe, even pistol-whipping Irish to defend two nuns he was holding up.\u00a0In contrast to his politeness to women, John is unafraid to take the moral high-ground when dealing with less than reputable characters, like Irish with his alcoholism and Nigel West Dickens with his swindling of gullible people.\u00a0John seems to be one of the only men in the game that is loyal to his wife. He also\u00a0seems to get angrier when someone mentions his wife's past than his own. John is a fairly serious individual with very little patience for the eccentricities of the various people he meets during the story. He frequently threatens Irish into sobering up so as to be of some use to him, and he is clearly disturbed/disgusted by Seth's habitual grave robbing. However, he is not above employing sarcasm in conversation with certain characters, particularly those he sees as exhibiting hypocrisy, such as Abraham Reyes. John is very complicated from a moral perspective. He respects women and refuses to commit adultery, yet can be quick to anger and never seems to feel guilty or remorseful about the murders he's committed both past and present. However, he does seem to have matured since his criminal days and simply desires to live out the rest of his life with his family. Despite Dutch leaving him for dead and devolving to a mindless murderer, he still holds respect for him as he was a father figure in John's life. Dutch educated John as a teen and had more of a role in his development than his own biological father. In the end, John is reluctant to kill Dutch despite having numerous chances to do so, displaying the respect he still has for him. Unlike many people of the time, John doesn't hold racist views and even sarcastically mocks those that do. John is also skeptical of new technology and the government as a whole. He once explains that \"most men can't handle power\" and explains to Marshal Leigh Johnson the irony of murder being a crime \"unless it's ordered by a court of law.\" Interestingly enough, John does nothing to solve these problems in society, but instead seems to further them. He helps Marshal Johnson murder criminals and aids Abraham Reyes in leading a revolution where he eventually is described as becoming a tyrant. It seems John has come to a realization that civilization will always be littered with hypocrisy, violence, unfairness and corruption. Unlike his former gang members, John stops trying to fight it and instead chooses a path to live a peaceful life as a rancher with a loving family. In Red Dead Redemption II, a younger John Marston is depicted. Unlike his older self, John is seen having a more apathetic, colder personality towards his family. Avoiding his responsibly of being a father to Jack, even believing for a time that Jack wasn't his son and often expressing annoyance at Abigail. At one point John even jokes about his family \"seeing corpses\" in reference to all the people he's murdered. As the Van der Linde gang faces increasingly dire situations, John frequently questions Dutch's plans and the overall morality of the gang. While at the same time, recognizing how much of a poor husband and father he's been due to the growing danger his family is being put in due to his actions which ultimately causes him to change after his wife and son leave him in 1907.Mission Appearances GOTY guidebook description  Our hero is a failed apostle. He is a man who fell in with Dutch van der Linde's vision, until he saw it become insane. Thus, he gave up his former life up to become a farmer and a family man. John grew up in a rough orphanage and started stealing and killing when he was young. Dutch saved him from a hanging and educated the illiterate Marston. He taught him ethics and a love of nature, a belief in things other than violence- other than power. John never really believed he could escape his past, especially after the killing on the train, but spent three years trying. Now his past has returned in the form of a government agency that is hell bent on solving these murders and is prepared to use his family to do so. He is a man who understands that human beings change, and that the world cannot be held up by one mans' dreams. He is both Van der Linde's greatest success, and his ultimate undoing.Trivia Red Dead Redemption Undead Nightmare Red Dead Redemption 2 Other Media Hungarian Half-bred  The Hungarian Half-bred is a horse breed featured in Red Dead Redemption.Description Characteristics  Alongside the Kentucky Saddler and American Standardbred, the Hungarian Half-bred is one of the three top-tier horses available in Redemption, not including DLCs. Out of the three top-tier horse breeds, the Hungarian Half-bred is statistically the best; while not as fast as the American Standardbred, it is still a very fast horse that possesses the highest damage resistance and stamina out of the three top-tier breeds. Described as a \"white horse\" the Hungarian Half-bred possesses a pale grey fur and a dark muzzle, as well as having pale mane and tail. The Hungarian Half-bred is unlocked at level 33 in multiplayer.Appearances  In the Stranger side-mission \"Love is the Opiate,\" the player must bring back a Hungarian Half-bred to the foreman. The man describes it as \"a white stallion which real cowboys ride\".Deed  A deed for this horse can be purchased at any General Store for $1500 ($750 with high enough Honor, or low enough honor at Thieves' Landing) after the player has successfully broken the horse at least once. As deeds are not single-use items, the player can use a deed as many times as they like, and it will still remain in their inventory. Usage of a deed will allow Marston to respawn his horse in the event it is killed or if the player wishes to switch horses.Locations  The Hungarian Half-Bred is most often found in Mexico. The Hungarian Half-Bred rarely spawn in Two Crows near Armadillo, but one or two were found. but on an extraordinary occasion, one was found in Tall Trees, on the grassy area in the north of Manzanita Post. Also, it appears just in the west of Punta Orgullo. Another possible location is around Odd Fellow's Rest.Trivia Achievement  The player is required to tame a Hungarian Half-bred to complete the following achievements/trophies:Jack Marston  John \"Jack\" Marston, Jr. is a recurring character in the Red Dead series, appearing as a central character and the secondary protagonist of Red Dead Redemption, and as a supporting character in Red Dead Redemption 2. With the addition of the Liars and Cheats DLC pack, Jack Marston is also a multiplayer character model that may be selected in the 'Redemption' section of the Outfitter.History Background  John Marston, Jr., better known as Jack, was born in 1895 as the first child of outlaw John Marston and prostitute Abigail Roberts, two members of the Van der Linde gang. He would also have a younger sister, who died before 1911. As the child of John and Abigail, Jack lived his early years around the various members of the Van der Linde gang such as Bill Williamson, Javier Escuella, Hosea Matthews, Sadie Adler, Arthur Morgan, Uncle and even Dutch van der Linde (among others); he saw the gang as his uncles and aunts, who in return watched over his growth and shielded his innocence from their more nefarious actions.Events of Red Dead Redemption 2  In 1899, Jack is living with the gang and is taken care of by its members. Jack doesn't usually leave the camp except on certain occasions such as when Arthur takes him fishing. Jack gets kidnapped by Angelo Bronte and is missing from the gang for some time before returning to the gang after they complete a business deal to get him back. John was badly injured during a train robbery and left to die by his former brothers-in-arms and left the gang with Jack and Abigail. By 1907, the Marston family owned a farm in Beecher's Hope, while John hired Uncle as manpower. The family also brought a dog called Rufus, to whom Jack took a liking.Events of Red Dead Redemption  In 1911, Jack and Abigail were taken hostage by Edgar Ross and Archer Fordham, two senior agents of the Bureau of Investigation, using them as leverage against John so he would hunt down Bill, Javier, and Dutch.Early chapters  While not physically present during the first three-fourths of Redemption's narrative, Jack is sporadically mentioned by his father during conversations with many of his allies and enemies, including Leigh Johnson, Luisa Fortuna, Javier Escuella and Dutch van der Linde.Marston Ranch  Jack first appears reuniting with his father after John finished his business with the Bureau of Investigation and is allowed to return back to the Marston Ranch. In a close hug, he apologizes to John for failing to maintain the ranch. The next day, Jack and his father visit MacFarlane's Ranch, owned by John's friends Drew and Bonnie MacFarlane, to purchase cattle from them. During the ride back and forth, Jack inquires his father about his meeting with the MacFarlanes, as well as revealing it was his first time visiting Hennigan's Stead. Sometime after helping both Abigail and Uncle, John takes time with teaching Jack hunting and skinning. The two go on a hunting trip with Rufus and take down a pair of elks. Afterward, John takes Jack to Manzanita Post to teach him about selling meat. In a later incident, Jack helps his father in killing a wolf pack that threatened the ranch's cattle.  Wishing to prove himself to his father, Jack decides to head up to Tall Trees and hunts down a grizzly bear by himself despite John's warnings. At Nekoti Rock, Jack is badly injured by a bear and his mount is killed in the process. John arrives with Rufus and kills the bear before taking Jack back to the ranch. During their ride back home, John expressed disappointment in his son's actions while Jack argued at his father's sparse involvement in his life.  Sometime after the grizzly hunt incident, Jack is found by his father at the barn where John praises his son for his skill with work tools. The tender moment between the two is cut short by a wide-scale attack by American soldiers and agents, led by Edgar Ross. Jack is ordered to stay in the Marston house with his mother while John and Uncle fight off the invaders.  After one wave of attackers, Jack joins his father and Uncle in the fight, but the latter quickly dies of a fatal bullet much to Jack's dismay. Jack and John fight more waves of soldiers before running off to the barn with Abigail. At the barn, Jack and Abigail are ordered by John to get on a horse and ride off as far as they can, promising to join them after dealing with the attackers. When Abigail hears gunshots from the ranch, she tells Jack to ride back to Beecher's Hope. The two find a recently deceased John in a pool of blood, and Jack comforts his mourning mother. Jack and Abigail then proceed to bury both John and Uncle on a hill overlooking the ranch.Epilogue  In 1914, three years after John and Uncle's deaths, Abigail dies and Jack proceeds to bury her. Now a nineteen year old gunslinger and the spitting image of his father with similar skill in combat, Jack decides to hunt down his father's killer. In Blackwater, Jack approaches an agent called Howard Sawicki, who he tricks into telling him of Edgar Ross. From Sawicki, Jack learns that Ross was awarded for killing John, and is now living his days out in a cabin on Lake Don Julio with his wife. With this, Jack departs Blackwater. Visiting Don Julio, Jack meets Edgar's wife Emily, who greets him with a rant about how the government doesn't let Ross retire in peace, before apologizing and directing him towards the camp of Edgar and his brother Philip, close to the San Luis River. Meeting Philip, Jack finally locates Ross down the river hunting ducks. Jack confronts the retired agent about his part in John's death, but Ross simply dismisses his actions as John's own fault. Unfazed by Ross' threats to kill him, Jack challenges the older man to a final duel. In a single moment, Jack guns down Ross and avenges his family's misfortune once and for all. With Ross' death, Jack looks at his gun somberly, realizing he's close to becoming an outlaw, the very same life his father tried to have him avoid. Jack hostlers his sidearm and walks away from the scene.Events of Undead Nightmare  Note: The events of Undead Nightmare are not considered part of the same canon as Red Dead Redemption. The following description is therefore not contiguous with the preceding section on Red Dead Redemption.  Jack appears as a supporting character in Undead Nightmare; he is first shown sitting with his mother at the Marston residence, reading a book while discussing swearing with Abigail. After John returns, he asks Jack about the book he's reading; an Aztec man who apparently must kill his people who have been infected by a virus or plague, which happens to foreshadow the events of the Undead Nightmare. Later that night, the Marston family are attacked by an undead Uncle, who manages to bite and infect Abigail before being finished off by John. A worried Jack rushes to help his mother but is quickly infected as well, prompting John to hogtie them. Before being hogtied, Jack chases Rufus. Abigail and Jack are then brought to John and Abigail's bedroom, where John leaves them with some food before leaving to find a cure for both. Jack is not seen again until the final mission, where he and Abigail are found by John to have returned to normal. Abigail's dialogue implies Jack was returned to normal after her. After being untied, Jack and Abigail embrace John. His fate after John's death and return as an undead are unknown, and he can't be found anywhere.Character Personality  Born into a gang of criminals, Jack's upbringing was that the gang was family to him and called most of them his aunts and uncles. Even when he was only 4 years old Jack could already read and write. He even learned how to fish through Arthur Morgan, and also learned some Italian after being taken by an Italian crime boss. When he is at this age he was much more open and wanted to be around people more but that wouldn't last long as by the time he is twelve he is shy and nervous and has started feeling inferior to his father. As a result of his upbringing, Jack initially lacked his father's courage and superior combat, farming, and survival skills, but possessed intelligence and empathy that far surpasses John's. Jack was a bright young man and spent most of his time reading different books that further expand his knowledge. By his own admission, he greatly enjoyed reading about wild adventures and brave heroes, which gave him a more romanticized view on the Old West, and his remarks in 1914 suggest he looked up to the legendary Landon Ricketts. His love for books and stories prompted him to aspire to become a writer or a scholar, which his parents partly approved, as they also wished for him to be a rancher. At times he appeared to be somewhat timid and was often mild-mannered when speaking to his family or friends. A major theme of his character is his sense of inferiority when compared to his father John, a veteran and experienced gunslinger and hunter. This led Jack to feel insecure and frightful whenever John approached him and made him all the more desperate to prove his worth to both his father and himself. Despite the mutual struggle to understand each another, Jack shared a very close bond with John. He also cared deeply for his mother Abigail, who worried about Jack's condition after the two were released from the Bureau control. He was also the only member of the Marstons who seemed to be in a constant positive relationship with Uncle, who taught him several inappropriate things much to John's disapproval.   The death of his family and the decline of the Marston ranch, all happening in a very short amount of time, greatly darkened Jack's personality. His grief and loneliness appear to have developed a severe case of depression and self-loathing. Many of the lines he says in different activities imply he became a death seeker with a subtle sadistic streak. He also appears to be both proud and ashamed of his heritage. He became somewhat cold and ruthless, making some dark jokes whenever he kills a horse, an outlaw or a woman, but also shows signs of disgust at himself and questioning his own actions. He also developed an intense hatred for the American government and its law enforcement organizations, deeming them the real criminals and the people responsible for the demise of his family. Jack's deep love for his family also ironically results in becoming the very thing his parents didn't want him to be: an outlaw. It was this love and grief that led him to hunt down Edgar Ross three years after his father's death, determined to avenge the Marstons even at the cost of his own innocence and future. At the same time, however, he also showed self-doubts about his motives, and even a hint of regret after gunning Ross down. In his quest for revenge, Jack kept a rather calm and friendly demeanor, and had his anger in check, only showing his intense hatred for Ross when the latter dismissed John's death upon being confronted.Gameplay  Jack can be found as an NPC at Beecher's Hope between the mission \"The Outlaw's Return\" and \"The Last Enemy That Shall Be Destroyed\". He can be seen to do various different actions depending on the time of the day, playing with a Repeater Carbine during the day, and sitting next to the fireplace and playing the harmonica during the night. Jack is first playable during the final sequence of the mission \"The Last Enemy That Shall Be Destroyed\"; he is limited to only riding his horse back to the Marston Ranch, and it is the only time where his 16 years-old self is controlled by the player. Following the completion of the aforementioned mission, Jack becomes the player-controlled character for the remainder of the game. Every weapon, horse, safehouse, Honor, Fame, bounty and outfit that John had is carried over to Jack. This also includes progress in most Strangers side-missions, for which he has his own recorded lines. As the quest specifically deals with his father's past and eventual fate, Jack is unable to start or continue the side-mission \"I Know You\". In return, Jack gets the unique \"Remember My Family\" quest-line, which allows the player to hunt down Edgar Ross and acts as the epilogue and full ending to the game's events. As the player character, Jack shares most of his animations with his father but is provided with his own unique voice and lines, which tend to include references to his father, mother, Uncle, Landon Ricketts, lawmen and animals. He is also capable of using the Dead Eye Targeting. Jack gets his own take on the game's default outfit, the Cowboy Outfit, which sees him wearing a beige jacket. He also has access to three law enforcement outfits that cannot be legally obtained by John: the US Army Uniform, the US Marshal Uniform, and the Bureau Uniform.Mission appearances Trivia Gallery Red Dead Redemption 2  </nowiki>See also References Strangers  Strangers are special NPC characters featured in Red Dead Redemption and Red Dead Redemption 2. Unlike core gameplay missions, these side-missions can be initiated and completed at any time. Strangers will request tasks or offer opportunities to the player.

It was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on May 18, 2010, in North America, and three days later on May 21, 2010, in Europe. Taking place in a wide open-ended environment featuring western parts of the American countryside and northern areas of Mexico, Redemption is presented through a third-person perspective. The majority of the game's story takes place in 1911 and follows protagonist John Marston, a former outlaw, as he is forced to hunt down his former associates by corrupted government agents. Upon release, Red Dead Redemption was highly acclaimed by critics, scoring 95/100 on Metacritic for both consoles, and receiving perfect scores from over 20 reviewers including GameSpy, 1Up.com, GamePro, Game Revolution, and VideoGamer. It was praised for its story, thematic depth, presentation, visuals, open world setting, and gameplay mechanics and as of 2013, has shipped over 13 million copies worldwide. Following its release, Redemption received multiple end-year accolades and was considered one of the best games of 2010. Its success led to the development of several DLC\u00b4s, including a new single-player campaign in Undead Nightmare. A successor game and a prequel, Red Dead Redemption II, was released on October 26, 2018.Synopsis  John Marston is a former outlaw looking for an all new life in 1911 America. When government agents from the newly-established Federal Bureau threaten his and his family's freedom, Marston is sent across the American West to help uphold the law and to achieve redemption. His job is to kill or capture his former gang members, including his old friends and gang partners such as\u00a0Bill Williamson and Dutch Van Der Linde. He must do this or his family will pay the ultimate price. Along the way through frontier towns, deserts, prairies, mountain passes, and territories, Marston is given work as he freely explores the free-roaming sandbox environments. The game features thirty-six species of animals that can be hunted and traded for supplies and cash. Marston also participates in jobs, activities, and games such as Poker, Horse Taming, and Nightwatch.Background Detail  The game takes place in 1911, which is near the end of the seventy-year span of the Western American Frontier (also known as the Wild West). As players see in the opening of the game, many new and \"unfamiliar\" people are moving into the West on the train. The town of Blackwater has noticeable modernized differences in architecture and technology compared to other gritty towns like Armadillo and Thieves' Landing. Electric line poles are also noticeable along roads. Even Marshal Leigh Johnson is seen fussing with a telephone in one of his mission cutscenes, showing the unfamiliarity with such technology people of his generation and likeness have. Some people have a hard time accepting this new lifestyle, and many are willing to fight to preserve their way of life. Players can see the frustration many characters have with the Federal Government and eastern folk. Being so far away from modern America gave the West a sense of self-reliance, independence and order which would have difficulty complying with the Federal Government. It was inevitable, as more and more people poured in from the east, that every part of the American West would be populated. It wasn't until the 1920s that the Wild West would become a famous and popular icon in American history and culture.Information Themes  Like Rockstar's crime epic Grand Theft Auto IV, Red Dead Redemption has many deep themes. The four main themes are: The battle between an old world facing change from a new world. The Old West in the game is being exposed to industrialization and new technologies such as automobiles, aircraft, Gatling guns, water-cooled machine-guns, and armored warfare. Ultimately, the Old West must contend with the taming of its lands and the coming of \"civilization.\" While some folk like those in Blackwater accept that change, other characters such as Dutch Van Der Linde, Bill Williamson, Javier Escuela, and John Marston do not. The main two factions in the game appear to be outlaws and lawmen. Both sides are equally bad, although in different ways. The outlaws steal and kill to live their lives with sheer brutality. The government does the same, albeit in a different manner. Near the end of the game, John Marston holds his old friend Dutch van der Linde at gunpoint by the edge of a cliff. Dutch tells John that he can't fight change, and even if times change, the Government will just find another enemy to contend with. The second theme appears to be a question that falls under the moral choice of good, neutral, and evil. The government agents in Blackwater (excluding Edgar Ross and Archer Fordham) believe they are good even though they usually interfere with the people of the West more than they help them. The outlaws in Dutch's Gang killed and stole from the rich but then gave to the poor. This raises the question: Is it acceptable to be evil and brutal in the present in order to achieve a better future? If both sides are indeed evil, then that makes John Marston neutral to good or evil. John has killed hundreds of people, abducted people, and stolen from the government his whole life. But yet, he realizes the mistake in his ways and to tries to restart his life with his family. He no longer cares which side is right, and that makes him neutral. Of course, it is up to the player to dictate how John Marston behaves during the course of the game. The third theme of Red Dead Redemption is that one's path will always catch up with the player. As stated above, John Marston lived a life of crime in his younger years, and now tries to put all of it behind him to start a ranch and to live a calmer life. However, there are no clean getaways from one's past when one lives the life of an outlaw, and the past always comes back to haunt them. To repair his past, John must achieve Redemption and justify his sins. He achieves this in the climax when he sacrifices himself to let his wife and son escape from government agents who have come to assassinate him. The fourth and final theme of the game is shown through the character of Dutch Van der Linde: self-destruction. The people from the New West are brightly dressed, own motor vehicles, and are bringing in new technology. While most accept this, Dutch Van der Linde sees it as evil and wants to destroy the new society. In Dutch's eyes, the world is meant to be brutal and a true fight for survival like it was in the Old West. This is also shown through Dutch's followers, angry Native Americans who come from a bloody and brutal background. Dutch thinks that technology, social order, and the government bring nothing but corruption, and this is why he sets out to destroy the town of Blackwater. A subtext which runs throughout the game, including many Stranger missions as well as the main plot, is that of obsession, self-deception, and madness. This is most directly apparent in the insane graverobber Seth Briars and his quest for his \"treasure\". It affects other people as well. In Let No Man Put Asunder, an elderly woman waits at an abandoned church, in her wedding dress, for her fianc\u00e9 who had died years before. In Flowers for a Lady, a man treats his wife's cadaver as if she were still alive. In Jenny's Faith, a girl dying in the wilderness refuses rescue because she believes her faith in God would save her. Daedalus and Son, Lights, Camera, Action, Aztec Gold, and California, all deal with obsessive and delusional quests for treasure that lead only to nothing or tragedy. The theme is used as a major plot device in the story of Luisa Fortuna's fatal fantasy in which she sees the self-serving revolutionary Abraham Reyes as her betrothed and a champion of the people. Harold MacDougal and his Quixotic attempt to \"understand\" the Indians but only in accordance with his misconceived notions. All of this unsettling background is there to reflect upon the main story and to John Marston himself: not only his obsession with recovering his wife and son, but the self-deception under which Marston convinces himself that through the way of the gun he could ever 'earn' a normal, peaceful family life, or a son who wouldn't follow the same violent path.Gameplay  The gameplay of Red Dead Redemption is vast. The use of guns in the game is very similar to that of Grand Theft Auto IV, another game developed by Rockstar Studios. There are a variety of pistols, revolvers, shotguns, and rifles available to the player as the game progresses. Ammo can be purchased in stores across the landscape, as can other useful items. Prices for various items vary from settlement to settlement.  There are numerous ways to make money in the game. One way is through random encounter missions which present themselves as the player travels. Players can also accept bounty hunter missions, to capture or kill escaped criminals; play games of chance such as poker or blackjack, search for treasure or hunt wild animals (skins, meat etc. can be sold at stores). There are many animals available to hunt ranging from dangerous animals such as boar, bears, cougars, wolves, coyotes, and even legendary animals such as Lobo the Wolf or Gordo the Boar, to harmless animals such as rabbits, birds, raccoons, and even beavers. A change from Grand Theft Auto's system of a wanted level is the bounty system. As players commit crimes, their bounty increases. Certain crimes raise the bounty more than others: murdering a sheriff, for instance, will raise the player's bounty more than committing arson. Players with high bounties will be tracked down by either the Mexican Army or the US Marshals depending on whether the player is in the US or Mexico. Players can surrender themselves to law officers at which point they will have to spend time in jail. If players cannot pay the bounty, they will be sent on a bounty hunter mission (it is best to capture the bounty alive so the player can get more money to pay off their own bounty). If a player can get close enough to a law officer who is currently in pursuit of Marston, they can bribe the officer (for a much larger fee than that required to pay off a civilian). This will stop all officers from chasing the player but one's bounty remains. Players can get rid of their bounty by going to telegraph offices and paying off their bounty piece by piece. Another option that can be used is to hand over a pardon letter, which eliminates all of a player\u2019s bounty.Development  A trailer of the project was sent to a select number of people at a Sony conference in 2005, promoting the release of the PlayStation 3 system. The trailer was a tech demo of RAGE set in a western setting referred to as Old West Project and a direct sequel to Red Dead Revolver. The trailer circulated throughout the internet. In the April 2005 edition of Game Informer, Red Dead Redemption was listed as being available for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC. On February 3, 2009, Rockstar Games announced the first official trailer. Resulting trailers showcased numerous characters, gameplay features, and multiplayer modes that were to be featured in the final release. Previews and beta releases included some features that were absent or changed in the final release.Contents Downloadable Content  Shortly after the release of Redemption, on June 22, 2010, Rockstar released the first DLC, Outlaws To The End. The content included six new cooperative side missions ranging from raiding a mine and stealing the gold to riding down a river to secure a town's weapon cache. New multiplayer challenges, as well as new trophies/achievements, were also included. The downloadable content is free for all users on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live. Rockstar subsequently announced several more major DLC; in chronological order, Legends and Killers, Liars and Cheats, Undead Nightmare, and Myths and Mavericks. Several other minor DLC was released as well. A full list can be found on the Redemption DLC category page. In September 2011, a Game of the Year edition was announced that includes all previously released DLC (details below). A Free-Roam pack had been announced earlier. It was initially going to be released for free, but Microsoft's and Sony's rules regarding the quantity of free DLC that a game can have resulted in the contents being incorporated into the Liars and Cheats pack instead.Pre-Order Contents  There were three bonuses for those who pre-ordered the game. The content itself was dependent on the vendor, as different shops provided different bonus content, with some even providing all three.Box Contents  The original boxed version of the game includes the following materials:Game of the Year Edition  On September 13, 2011, Rockstar announced that a Game of the Year Edition of Red Dead Redemption would be released on October 11, 2011. This edition bundles the game with all downloadable content released to date. This edition also brings the Solomon's Folly gang hideout and the Walton's Gang Outfit to the Xbox 360. The Game of the Year edition adds a Hardcore single-player difficulty option that was not previously available for the game.Reception  Upon release, the game received widespread critical acclaim from all over the gaming industry. Aside from a few graphical glitches (noted by IGN and other gaming sites), its presentation, sound, and multiplayer were universally praised. While others such as GamePro have criticized the \"occasional pop-in and repetitive missions\", they also said it \"expertly captures the Wild West\", with 1UP giving similar praise and complaints. IGN gave the game 9.7/10' GamePro gave it 5/5 stars, and 1UP gave it an A. The average score, according to Metacritic, is 95 out of 100 for both PS3 and Xbox 360 versions with 100% of critic reviews rated as \"positive.\" The game won the title of \"Game of the Year\" from multiple publications as well as awards based on user and developer voting. Among these are the Spike VGAs 2010, Game Informer, Game Developers Choice Awards, GameSpy, and GameSpot. The soundtrack also received many awards. GameSpy gave it 5/5 stars saying that Rockstar managed to create one of \"the most impressive open worlds I've ever seen in a game, and it's telling that \u2014 even after playing for over 30 hours \u2014 all I want to do is get back on my horse and gallop back into the wilderness.\" VideoGamer gave it a 10/10 exclaiming \"The game itself is absolutely spectacular... The sheer quality of Red Dead Redemption is evident right from the word go.\" They also said, \"it's a magnificent piece of work that everybody should play.\" The game's most \"negative\" review was made by Eurogamer, who gave it 8/10, stating that it \"re-clothes\" the Grand Theft Auto series with its \"distinct and expertly realized scenario\". Other reviewers such as Edge, GameSpot, GameTrailers, PALGN and Game Informer, gave the game scores ranged between 9/10 to 10/10.Eighth generation re-releases  The Xbox 360 version was made playable to Xbox One owners via backward compatibility on July 8, 2016. The PlayStation 3 version was made playable to PlayStation 4 owners via PlayStation Now on December 6, 2016. On April 10, 2018, the Xbox One backward compatibility version received a patch that enables Xbox One X owners to play the game in native 4K resolution.Trivia References  0Locations in Redemption  The sprawling world of Red Dead Redemption covers a total of 94 individual locations spread across three primary territories, each of which is split into a number of constituent regions. The land is a vast, open area of varying landscapes populated with a wide variety of flora and fauna. The area is based loosely on the Rio Grande Basin in Texas /\u00a0Mexico, the Sonoran and Mojave Deserts of Arizona, and the prairies of New Mexico of Arizona. The forested region is roughly based of the Rocky Mountains along with the Ponderosa Pine Forests and Arizona. The Great Plains are modeled after the plains of the Midwestern U.S. Within the region there are settlements, gang hideouts, camps, outposts, railroads, mines, bridges, mountains, fields, rivers, lakes, deserts, forests, canyons, major geographical features, Stranger missions, and much more. The San Luis River is the geographical backbone of the world, splitting the map in half and defining the boundaries of the three major territories, running between West Elizabeth, New Austin and Nuevo Para\u00edso, and emptying into the Sea of Coronado. There are small lakes scattered throughout the frontier, like Lake Don Julio in the south of Cholla Springs, and the much larger Flat Iron Lake which defines the eastern edge of the map, home to the port city of Blackwater.New Austin  New Austin is the first explorable territory available to the player at the start of a new game. The New Austin territory consists of four counties: Cholla Springs, R\u00edo Bravo, Gaptooth Ridge, and Hennigan's Stead. The land is based on the American South-Southwest (from California, through Arizona, New Mexico and Texas into Louisiana). Scrub desert covers most of the region to the west, becoming rolling prairie as one travels eastward and ending as lush wetland near the margins of Flat Iron Lake. Within New Austin are the towns of Armadillo, Plainview, Thieves' Landing, Rathskeller Fork and the ghost town of Tumbleweed. Also in this area are the large homesteads of Ridgewood Farm and MacFarlane's Ranch, a number of smaller farms and ranches, and the infamous Fort Mercer. In this area there are some locations that sometimes do not show up as places found even after purchasing and using the map for this area. Tanner's Span and Mason's Bridge are two railway bridges SW and SE respectively of the Pacific Union Railroad Camp. Crossing these bridges will unlock these two locations and count towards 100% Completion . Maps of Cholla Springs and Gaptooth Ridge are available to buy from the Armadillo General Store. Maps of Hennigan's Stead are available from the store at MacFarlane's Ranch. Maps of R\u00edo Bravo are available in the general store in Thieves' Landing.Nuevo Para\u00edso  Nuevo Paraiso, meaning New Paradise in Spanish, is the second explorable territory. Nuevo Paraiso represents the northern part of Mexico, a new country with a different language and different overall feel. It is unlocked in the story mission \"We Shall Be Together in Paradise\". The Nuevo Paraiso territory consists of three regions: Punta Orgullo, Perdido, and Diez Coronas. The region is most likely based on the Mexican border state Leon Nuevo Leon. Nuevo Paraiso is even vaster and emptier than New Austin with deserts, enormous mesas, canyons and mountains. Within this area are the towns of Chuparosa, Escalera (the secret area from Undead Nightmare is also under the villa in Escalera, also known as the Escalera Catacombs), the fortress of El Presidio, the nunnery of Las Hermanas and the settlements of Agave Viejo, El Matadero, Torquemada and Casa Madrugada. Many of the regions and towns can be translated into English. Punta Orgullo translates to Point Pride, Diez Coronas translates to Ten Crowns, and Perdido translates to Lost . Of the towns, Chuparosa, is similar to the Spanish word Chuparrosa, or Hummingbird. Escalera means Ladder ( the town climbs upward), El Presidio translates to The Prison, El Matadero translates to The Slaughterhouse (there is a slaughterhouse in the town) and Casa Madrugada means Morning House. Agave Viejo translates to Old Agave (agave is a type of desert plant similar to aloe vera), and Torquemada means \"Burnt Tower\". You can buy maps of the territory at the market in Chuparosa, and at the Gunsmith shop in Escalera. You can buy newspaper for activities in Nuevo Paraiso.West Elizabeth  West Elizabeth is the third and final explorable territory which is unlocked following the story mission \"An Appointed Time\". This region is part of America like New Austin, but it differs greatly from the rest of the land. The region is characterized by mountainous pine forests to the west, snowy mountains in the far north, and large empty prairie to the east. It is based on the American Rocky Mountains region (from Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, Arizona). It is the smallest territory in the game, being roughly the size of Cholla Springs. This region is far more industrialized and civilized than New Austin with the modern city of Blackwater boasting paved streets, street lighting, road signs and automobiles.\u00a0 West Elizabeth consists of Tall Trees to the north-west and the Great Plains region which makes up most of the territory. West Elizabeth has a mountain called Nekoti Rock which is where Brumas the Bear can be found; it is also home to many Grizzly Bears. The town of Blackwater (where John Marston passes through in the first cut scene of \"Exodus in America\") lies on West Elizabeth's eastern coast, while the smaller Manzanita Post can be found in Tall Trees. The highest point in Red Dead Redemption is also here, an area called Cochinay, which consists of snowy mountains and cliffs, canyons and a secluded hideout. Maps of West Elizabeth can be bought at the general stores in Blackwater and Manzanita Post.Interactive Map  Click on different locations in the map to see the location's page.  \u200bUS Marshal Uniform  The US Marshal Uniform is an outfit available to be worn by Jack Marston in Red Dead Redemption.Description  The outfit is obtained by completing the five American gang hideouts within 24 hours of game time. It is required for 100% Completion and the Redeemed achievement. Wear the US Marshal Uniform and the player will be considered part of law enforcement in the United States. Also, the player doesn't need to pay for a stagecoach. Even though the player is to be treated like the law, sheriffs and deputies will still come after the player if caught breaking the law, but Marshals and possees will lay off. This outfit acts the same as the Reyes' Rebels Outfit but in the U.S.Acquisition  The requirements for this outfit will be shown once the mission \"The Last Enemy That Shall Be Destroyed\"\u00a0has been completed and cannot be obtained before then. Therefore, this outfit can only be worn by Jack. The hideouts the player has to complete in the 24 hour in-game time period are:Tips & Tricks Trivia Achievements/Trophies  Obtaining the US Marshal Uniform contributes toward acquisition of the following Achievement/Trophy:Four Horses of the Apocalypse  The Four Horses of the Apocalypse are some of the mythical creatures unleashed in the Red Dead Redemption Undead Nightmare DLC pack. They are War, Famine, Pestilence, and Death.Characteristics  These four new mounts can be found and broken by John Marston, although Death is additionally awarded upon completion of the \"On a Pale Horse\" quest. Each of these mounts are faster and tougher than a regular horse or undead horse. If the mount is killed or John Marston breaks a different horse without retrieving and hitching the original one, the mount cannot be directly recalled until Marston completes Rank 5 of the Four Horses of the Apocalypse Challenge. Completion of the challenge awards Marston with \"Blood Pacts\" for each of the Apocalypse Horses, functioning exactly the same way as horse deeds. However, Death's Blood Pact is automatically acquired upon breaking him or receiving him at the end of the game. By default, all mythical mounts have unlimited stamina and extremely high health. However, any mythical horse can still be killed from direct damage to the head or extremely long falls. Note: If fed horse pills, these mythical horses will lose their unlimited stamina. Mortality aside, each of the Four Horses of the Apocalypse possess somewhat unique attributes and physical characteristics, making them easy to discern from one another; as well as from normal and undead steeds. They are summoned via Blood Pacts in lieu of proper deeds. Each Blood Pact bears a brief description of the horse to which it applies. Those descriptions are transcribed below, in the order in which the Blood Pacts are arranged in the player's satchel once they are awarded: When one of the horses or another mythical creature is nearby, a blue circular area will appear on the mini-map along with the notice, \"A mythical creature has appeared in the area.\" Unlike other mini-map notifications, however, the blue circle covers a large area and does not move with its target. In other words, the target may escape outside of the blue circle at any time, thus decreasing its likelihood of discovery. After a mythical mount's apparent death or loss (prior to obtaining their Blood Pact), it is possible to find each Horse of the Apocalypse again in the wild. Unfortunately, the notification and blue circle on the mini-map will not accompany the mythical mount's appearance after they have already been broken once before. Common discovery locations are listed on the individual articles for each horse, however, these are only guidelines as their locations vary randomly.Challenge  Acquisition of the four horses is one of the ambient challenges in Undead Nightmare. Completion of this challenge is necessary in order to obtain the Legend of the Apocalypse outfit and 100% game completion in Undead Nightmare.Tips Tips Trivia Achievements/Trophies  Completion of Four Horses of the Apocalypse Challenges contributes towards the acquisition of the following Trophies/Achievements:", "D&D 5th Edition Wikia": "D&D 5th Edition Wikia ", "Dark Souls \u0432\u0438\u043a\u0438": "Dark Souls \u0432\u0438\u043a\u0438 ", "Don't Starve game Wiki": "Don't Starve game Wiki ", "GTA Wiki": "GTA Wiki Vehicles in GTA IV  The following is a list of vehicles which can be driven, ridden on, or controlled in Grand Theft Auto IV. For vehicles added in the downloadable episodes The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony, see Vehicles in The Lost and Damned and Vehicles in The Ballad of Gay Tony. Please note that all vehicles from GTA IV appear in the episodic contents so it is redundant to mention their appearances in those articles. This game has a total of 123 vehicles.List of Vehicles  The following table lists separate models of vehicles in GTA IV. Variants that use modifications of pre-existing vehicles are not listed here (gang cars such as the Huntley Sport, the Futo GT, etc) - only vehicles that are separate models in the files.Grand Theft Auto IV  Grand Theft Auto IV Michael Hunter - Soviet Connection Main Theme Grand Theft Auto IV (also known as GTA IV or GTA 4) is the eleventh title in the Grand Theft Auto series. The game was developed by Rockstar North and was published and released by Rockstar Games for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC. The Xbox 360 and PS3 versions were released worldwide to widespread hype on April 29, 2008. GTA IV has subsequently been awarded the Gaming World Record of the Most Successful Entertainment Launch of All Time, and has received numerous other awards and accolades. The PC version was released on December 3, 2008. GTA IV and Grand Theft Auto: Episodes from Liberty City were released for Xbox One via backwards compatibility on February 9, 2017.Theme  The very first dialogue by Niko in the very first trailer for the game sets up the first notable protagonist to be from another country other than the United States, Niko Bellic, to enter the United States of America and make more critical analysis of American culture than previous main characters have done. Grand Theft Auto IV's deeper meaning circulates around Niko's own philosophy, and his clear, blunt critiques of American culture and life in general make the deeper ideas much easier to see and understand. Niko is normally shown to be in the right, but is also proven to be overly cynical, leaving interpretation open to the viewer. The game and its very complex plot deals with several themes: As read on the packaging of the game, Rockstar Games asks \"what does the American dream mean today?\". Niko is cynical about America, saying \"capitalism is a dirty business\" and only people who are extremely greedy and/or born into wealth have any opportunity. Mikhail Faustin also laments before he dies that \"America made him (Dimitri Rascalov) greedy! ...This American greed takes everyone! It is like a disease!\". Niko mocks American stereotypes like \"strip malls and clinical obesity\" (as do the makers of the game by hilariously parodying concepts like post-9/11 hysteria and celebrity obsession). On the plus side, Roman Bellic, as well as other characters (Brucie Kibbutz, Bernie Crane, Ivan Bytchkov and Hossan Ramzy among others) are optimistic about America and life in general, tend to do very well for themselves financially, and try in vain to encourage Niko to be more optimistic. The American Dream is also shown not to be promised to anyone, not even when they already live in America. Social circles all the way from Playboy X and Elizabeta Torres to Patrick McReary all have trouble making and responsibly saving money, not restricting it to any one nationality. Early on, The Beat 102.7 explains that their listeners \"don't know how to manage their money yet!\". Gerry McReary describes his family's spending habits as \"Never any fucking focus! Never! ...Oh yeah, wine and women as quick as possible, and remain a slave forever\". Packie eventually says after a mission \"Well, Niko, that was a whole lot of effort for no fucking reward. Story of my life.\" to which Niko replies \"It is the story of a lot of lives, Packie. I'm getting used to hearing it\". A very interesting part of the in-game media is a reality TV show called I'm Rich, which documents the most outrageous displays of gluttony by the world's wealthiest people, enough to make anyone feel inadequate. Grand Theft Auto IV has an extremely complex plot with a very long list of characters. It is also the first game in the HD Universe that allows the player to change the plot by making choices, which all have consequences. This creates an atmosphere where Niko is haunted and shadowed by his past actions wherever he goes. He tells Roman: \"There is no such thing as a new beginning, Roman. With every day we live, we pick up new baggage, baggage we must carry with us for the rest of our lives. There's no dropping it and pretending we are fresh and clean, just because we get off a boat in a new place.\" Prime examples include his numerous encounters with Ray Bulgarin, most of the random characters, and working alongside Johnny Klebitz or Patrick McReary while he had, either by not having met them yet or circumstances beyond his control, killed someone close to them. In the finale, Niko feels the coffin of Kate or Roman, depending on the player's choice, on his conscience because of his criminal lifestyle, saying they \"never should have gotten close to me\". He is deeply depressed about being trapped in the criminal lifestyle (by a need of income), telling Kate McReary and others that he wishes he could leave it behind, but often adds that he knows he can't. Main Characters:Voice Cast  'Character ListEpisodes  Two episodes have been released for Grand Theft Auto IV for the Xbox 360, and then released for PlayStation 3 and PC in April 2010. The Lost and Damned was released on February 17, 2009, and features biker Johnny Klebitz as the player character. The Ballad of Gay Tony was been released on October 29, 2009, with Luis Fernando Lopez as the protagonist. It was simultaneously released with the disc version of Episodes from Liberty City, which features both games. These episodes are set in the same city and time as GTA IV, and have many overlapping storylines, characters, and missions. They add new missions, characters, vehicles, weapons, and other gameplay features.Timeframe  Although nothing in the game specifically reveals the exact month the events of the game take place, most evidence suggests that it may take place between April and September.Controversy  There was much controversy over Grand Theft Auto IV, however, the series has experienced trouble throughout its whole time on the shelves. Before it was released, it was almost banned. Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) noted the drink-driving feature and requested it either not be released, or rated Adults Only. Because of this, Niko often says \"I shouldn't really be doing this\" whenever the player attempts to drink and drive. There was also controversy for the PC version with the game still supporting the defunct Games for Windows Live. Despite the recent update by Rockstar Games for proper optimization, Games for Windows Live has yet to be omitted.Game Information  Game Content Game Features Main ArticlesTrivia Further Reading Videos  See more videosExternal links Vehicles in GTA San Andreas  The following is a complete listing of vehicles in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. See here on what constitutes a vehicle. Based on that criteria, there are a total of 212 vehicles defined by the game. Please discuss changes to this list on the talk page.Deleted vehicles See Also Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas  Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Main Theme Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is a Rockstar North-developed video game, and is the seventh title in the Grand Theft Auto series. It is the sequel to Grand Theft Auto: Vice City and the prequel to Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories and Grand Theft Auto III. It was released on the same date as Grand Theft Auto Advance. GTA San Andreas is set in the fictional state of San Andreas. By far the largest and most complex playing field of any 3D Universe game, San Andreas consists of three fully-realized cities: Los Santos, San Fierro and Las Venturas, and includes vast expanses of countryside, forests, a desert, and even a mountain and many hills. The game is centered around the return of Carl Johnson (also known as CJ) to his gang (the Grove Street Families), and their subsequent return to power.Voice Cast Gameplay and Information  Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is similarly structured to the previous two games in the series. The core gameplay consists of elements of third-person shooter and a driving game, affording the player a large, open environment in which to move around. On foot, the player's character is capable of walking, running, swimming (the first Grand Theft Auto game in which diving and swimming without drowning is possible), limited climbing, and jumping, as well as using weapons and various forms of hand to hand combat. Players can operate a variety of vehicles, including automobiles, boats, airplanes, helicopters, trains, tanks, motorcycles,\u00a0and bicycles. Players may also import vehicles rather than steal them. Carl Johnson is Grand Theft Auto's most customizable protagonist due to the possibility in-game to change his clothes, tattoos, hairstyle, and even his body mass in which he can be fat, skinny, or muscular. Later 3D-era games eliminated many of the customization, swimming, and climbing abilities enjoyed by CJ. The ability to change body mass (due to eating and exercise - or lack thereof - which requires ongoing maintenance until a certain collectables challenge is completed) is as of 2017 unique to San Andreas as it has not been attempted again with any further 3D or HD-universe games. One aspect of Grand Theft Auto III and Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\u00a0(and the later Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories) that is eliminated in San Andreas is the \"Welcome to\" loading screens, which often disrupted game flow in those games; in San Andreas, transition between areas occurs with no such interruption.Game Information Gangs in San Andreas  Rockstar North conducted massive amounts of research before developing the gangs of San Andreas; this primarily involved talking to DJ Pooh, Mister Cartoon, Estevan Oriol, and hundreds of other well-known faces. Gangs play a much larger role in San Andreas than they did in Vice City. Gang members are recognized by their clothing, tattoos, and hand signs. These are useful for two reasons: it allows police to identify a gang set or victim, and it allows gang members to interact with one another. Each gang has its own territory, indicated by street warnings, wall graffiti, or simply violence. In Los Santos, two of the four gangs are split up into different \"sets\". While not all sets get along, at least there's always plenty of backup available.Gang Wars & Territory  Winning territory involves gang wars, so this must be done carefully. Enter the area that is eagered to control, and kill every opposing member in sight. Killing three members on foot will provoke a gang war, and the area under attack will flash red on the radar. The opposing gang will attack in three waves to defend their turf. Keep a close eye on the radar and watch where the attackers come from. They may attack unexpectedly or in large numbers, so make sure to get plenty of health and armor before starting the war. If possible, shoot from a long distances or from the rooftops. Survive the three waves and the area is taken over. The area is now highlighted green on the map, indicating the gang has gained possession over it. Similarly, other gangs may try and take back the territory; it's up to you to defend it. Gang wars and territory are introduced during the mission \"Doberman\". After the mission \"The Green Sabre\", CJ no longer has the ability to win new territory, or defend his own. This feature returns during the mission \"Home Coming\", in the Final Missions strand. By default, gang territories to take over are only available for player in Los Santos. By performing the Territory Glitch, player can unlock aditional territories to take over.Recruit Others  CJ can recruit other members of his gang. The number of gang members he can recruit is based on CJ's respect level, with the game-wide maximum number being seven. There's also a limited number of seats in a vehicle. A typical car can carry two to four people, whereas a coach or bus can hold all seven members. While homies are recruited, the player can get them to follow or stay put. CJ's homies will return fire to those who attack him, and shoot at rival gang members and cops. They will also participate in drive-by shootings, just like Sweet, Smoke, and Ryder demonstrate in the mission \"Drive-By\". Homies aren't very reliable, but they can draw fire away from CJ. CJ can also take a picture of himself with his homies. Aiming a camera at them will make them flash their gang signs.Influences  Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\u2015just like Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\u2015is heavily based on many crime-drama movies in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The game's soundtack, which features, amongst others, gangsta rap, alternative/grunge/metal and new jack swing, was also taken from that same era. The biggest counterpart of GTA San Andreas is the 1993 hood film Menace II Society. Many aspects were taken from this movie such as Los Santos being based on Los Angeles during the movie, plus Grove Street itself is a reference to the film. Also some of the lines in the game were taken from the movie. Furthermore the green Sabre drive by shooting, the trigger of the game storyline, is inspired by the final scene of the movie. One of your gang members with the green flannel shirt and the braids resembles O-Dog played by Larenz Tate, one of the main characters from the film. Also, the Balla wearing the beanie and shades resembles Harold's killer/carjacker who was later killed by O-Dog and Caine in a revenge killing in the film. Another film that greatly influenced Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas was the 1988 film Colors. The C.R.A.S.H. unit of the LAPD deals with Bloods, Crips, and Hispanic gangs at war, which much of the Los Santos storyline is based upon. Many of the missions in the game are influenced by scenes from the film. Officer Eddie Pulaski, played by the late Chris Penn, is based on Officer Danny \"Pac Man\" McGavin, which is played by his brother Sean Penn in the movie. New Jack City is another film that influenced Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, particularly the San Fierro chapter. CJ befriends and works for Jizzy B to infiltrate and bring down the Loco Syndicate, just like Scotty Appleton (Ice-T) did to Nino Brown (Wesley Snipes) and the Cash Money Brothers in the film. Jizzy B. is loosely based on Nino Brown, and CJ can be made look similar to Nino Brown (if CJ buys the clothes from Victim), and Big Smoke's Crack Palace closely resembles the Carter Apartment Buildings in the film. Other influences on San Andreas are:Timeframe  Although it is not explicitly stated when in 1992 the game takes place, it would appear to be around winter either at the beginning or towards the end of the year, due to the fact that when Carl travels to Liberty City during Saint Mark's Bistro, the city is covered by snow.Tips and Tricks Reception  Prior to its release for the PlayStation 2, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas was one of the most highly anticipated video games of 2004, along with Halo 2, Doom 3 and Half Life 2. San Andreas met most of these expectations, as it was praised as one of the PlayStation 2's best games, with an average review score on 95%, according to Metacritic, tying for the fifth highest ranked game in PlayStation 2 history. IGN rated the game a 9.9/10 (the highest score it has ever awarded to a PlayStation 2 game), calling it \"the defining piece of software\" for the PlayStation 2. GameSpot rated the game 9.6/10, giving it an Editor's Choice award. San Andreas also received an A rating from the 1UP.com network and a 10/10 score from Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine. As of March 26, 2008, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas has sold 27.5 million units according to Take-Two Interactive. The Guinness World Records 2009 Gamer's Edition list it as the most successful game on the PlayStation 2, with 17.33 million copies sold for that console alone, from a total of 21.5 million in all formats. The New York Times' Charles Herold gave the only non-positive review for San Andreas, giving it a 'mediocre' rating of 4.0 out of 10, criticizing the \"annoying\" mission structure, and the casualness of the intense violence featured in the game. Sales:Controversy  The game has received widespread acclaim for its technical achievements and free gameplay. However, it also received widespread criticism\u2015initially due to its \"gangster\" elements, which include drugs, prostitution, and murder; but later due to the discovery of disabled interactive sex scenes, nicknamed Hot Coffee, which could be re-enabled using third-party mods. This led to the re-rating by the ESRB of the game from Mature to Adults-Only until a second version, with the sex scenes fully removed (and removed the ability to mod the PC version), was released.Trailers Trivia Further Reading Official Site External Links The Ballad of Gay Tony  Grand Theft Auto: The Ballad of Gay Tony Main Theme Grand Theft Auto: The Ballad of Gay Tony (official abbreviation TBoGT) is the second episode of two downloadable add-ons for Grand Theft Auto IV. It is the fourth expansion pack in the Grand Theft Autoseries and the 13th release in the series.\u00a0It was released on October 29, 2009. The PlayStation 3 and PC versions were later released on April 13, 2010 in North America and on April 16, 2010 in Europe. The protagonist is Luis Fernando Lopez, a part-time hoodlum and full-time assistant to legendary nightclub impresario Tony Prince. The storyline intertwines with the original game and first episode, most notably the Museum Piece mission that involves all three protagonists. As well as a new storyline, missions, and characters, it also features new game mechanics, vehicles, weapons, side missions, collectibles and achievements/trophies. As with The Lost and Damned, new radio and in-game television programming is included. The game is also the first game in the series to implement a scoring system for missions. Rockstar says, \"Players will struggle with the competing loyalties of family and friends, and with the uncertainty about who is real and who is fake in a world in which everyone has a price.\" According to Rockstar's official website, \"The Ballad of Gay Tony injects Liberty City with an overdose of guns, glitz, and grime.\" Sam Houser, the founder of Rockstar Games, said before its release \"This episode's focus on high-end night life contrasts with the biker gangs portrayed in The Lost and Damned, whilst giving us a lot of new gameplay possibilities.\" As a downloadable expansion, it costs $19.99 (USD) on both Xbox Live and PlayStation Network. At first, The Ballad of Gay Tony, along with the first piece of downloadable content, The Lost and Damned, was going to be released to the PS3 and PC on March 30, but due to Sony Computer Entertainment wanting to edit some of the radio stations, it was released on the later date of April 13 in North America and April 16 in Europe. The stories for GTA IV, The Lost and Damned, and The Ballad of Gay Tony were written by Dan Houser and Rupert Humphries. All three stories run alongside each other and interwine at various points.Synopsis  In contrast to The Lost and Damned, an account of life in a biker gang, The Ballad of Gay Tony shines light on arguably the most glamorous place on Earth - the celebrity nightclub scene. Luis Lopez and Tony Prince are the two main characters. Being in debt to gangsters, Luis and Tony are barraged with temptation and the ever increasing necessity of selling each other out. The duo reject some substantial opportunities; Yusuf Amir franchising them, Cloe Parker bailing them out, Ray Bulgarin buying them out, Mori Kibbutz having a high-stakes bet, Rocco Pelosi threatening them, and Tony himself resorting to fraud. Very few, if any, of the characters make it the entire game without telling a lie; sometimes because of business, other times because of a social imbalance (such as Yusuf wanting to impress Luis, or Tony mocking Mori behind his back while flattering him eye to eye) - which gives the impression and teaches the valuable life lesson that no one is to be trusted. By the end of the game Luis and Tony have resolved trust issues they have with each other, successfully erased their debt and it is hinted that they may have eventually agreed to franchise Maisonette 9 and Hercules with Yusuf, despite their initial refusal. Characters: Another important set of characters, though they do not affect the main storyline, are the fictional celebrities met in the Club Management missions. Luis and Tony are made the peers and trusted confidants of extremely powerful celebrities. Beyond the comic value of pop culture, it is meant to portray opportunity raining from the sky for Tony and Luis, some of which might lure them to abandon or endanger each other.Story  Luis Fernando Lopez is being held hostage at the Bank of Liberty, during a robbery involving Niko Bellic, Patrick McReary, Derrick McReary and Michael Keane. A local gun club member lying next to him, Eugene Reaper, shoots and kills Keane and is then killed by the McReary brothers in retaliation. The scene cuts to the aftermath of the robbery; Luis is being questioned by the police about the incident before proceeding to Gay Tony's loft. On the way, he is nearly run over by Niko Bellic (returning from the robbery) and Johnny Klebitz who rides past him. Rocco Pelosi, a senior Ancelotti mobster, and his accomplice Vince enter the loft and collect Tony's club income for the week as interest repayment on an outstanding loan. Tony then discusses with Luis his dire financial situation with his two clubs, Maisonette 9 and Hercules. In an attempt to curry favor with Rocco, Tony and Luis go to Chinatown to negotiate a deal with a senior Triad. Billy Grey, President of The Lost Motorcycle Gang is seen arranging an ambush on Johnny Klebitz and Jim Fitzgerald with the Triad as Tony and Luis enter the room. The negotiations with the Triad soon turn awry, and Luis protects Tony as they escape Chinatown. Luis visits his mother, who also has financial issues, and his childhood friends Henrique Bardas and Armando Torres. Luis' mother does not approve of his lifestyle and would like him to attend to college. Henrique and Armando are Luis' friends who are heavily involved with the narcotics distribution trade. Luis soon becomes acquainted with Yusuf Amir, a real estate developer in Liberty City. Luis helps Yusuf acquire several vehicles, including an experimental military grade chopper called the \"Buzzard\", an APC used by the NOOSE, and even a subway carriage. Meanwhile, Tony is headed in a downward spiral due to substance abuse, supplied by his boyfriend Evan Moss. Luis, Tony and Evan head to the docks to buy $2 million worth of diamonds from a cook coming in on a tanker called the \"Platypus\". During the exchange, members of the The Lost (now led by Johnny Klebitz, formerly Billy Grey) attack and kill Evan and acquire the diamonds. Tony promises Luis that he will quit the substance abuse and introduces Luis to Mori Kibbutz, and his younger brother Brucie. Mori is highly egotistical, constantly bullies and belittles Brucie, a source of irritation to Luis who repeatedly stands up for the younger brother. Through entering Triathlons and undertaking dangerous police chases, Luis eventually managed to cancel Tony's debt to Mori. After Brucie finally retaliates and punches Mori, he later shows up at Maisonette 9 to thank Luis. Brucie leans in towards Luis after a series of compliments, strongly implying an attempt to hit on him. Luis strongly declines, and Brucie awkwardly attempts to convince Luis that he was just testing him to see if he was gay. Tony and Luis meet Ray Bulgarin and his associate Timur at Maisonette 9, who offer Luis some work in exchange for financial help. Luis helps Bulgarin eliminate some corrupt federal agents and acquire the Liberty City Rampage hockey team. Gracie Ancelotti gets Tony back on the drugs and is later kidnapped by unknown assailants. The Ancelottis establish that Gracie has been kidnapped because of the diamonds and are pointing the blame at Tony and Luis. Tony learns that the diamonds are being exchanged at The Libertonian, and sends Luis to retrieve them. Luis ambushes the exchange (involving Niko Bellic and Johnny Klebitz) and escapes in the Buzzard, which has since been gold plated. Bulgarin phones Luis, telling him to go to the roof of a building in midtown Algonquin. As Luis uncovers the severed head of the cook from the \"Platypus\", Bulgarin explains that the diamonds belong to him and accuses the cook, Luis and Tony of colluding to steal them. It emerges that Bulgarin has led Luis to an ambush on the rooftop, and he escapes alive. Gracie\u2019s father, Giovanni Ancelotti, then orders Luis and Tony to trade the diamonds with the kidnappers and get Gracie back. At the exchange, Bulgarin shows up and orders his men to attack the assailants, Packie McReary and Niko Bellic. Bulgarin flees the scene and amidst the chaos the diamonds fall into a dump truck headed the opposite direction. Luis, Tony and Gracie escape in a speedboat. Because of being preoccupied with recent events, Tony refuses to pay his debts and the city closes down all of his clubs. Luis meets Rocco and Vince in the restrooms in Middle Park, and they explain to him that he must kill Tony, or the Ancelottis and Russians will team up and kill Tony, Luis and all of their friends and family. Luis shows up at Maisonette 9, and contemplates shooting Tony before pointing the gun at Vince and shooting him in the head. Tony warns Luis not to shoot Rocco, as he is a \"made man\". Rocco escapes and the Russians show up ensuing in a huge gunfight within the club. Tony blames Luis for contemplating to kill him and flees to his apartment to pack and move to the desert. Luis convinces Tony that he chose not to kill him because it is them against the world, and that they need to resolve their situation. Luis ventures to Firefly Island to ambush a Russian heroin exchange, telling Tony to hide out by the Monoglobe in Meadows Park. In the fairground, Luis destroys the heroin and kills Timur, who mentions that Bulgarin is fleeing the city by plane within two hours. After an opportune phone conversation, Yusuf shows up in the Buzzard and eliminates the pursuing Russians while Luis drives to the airport. Luis manages to board the plane, and kills all of the henchmen on board. A vengeful Bulgarin emerges from the cockpit holding a grenade, threatening destruction to both of them if Luis kills him. Luis takes the risk and shoots Bulgarin, who drops the grenade causing it to explode. Luis parachutes out of the burning wreckage of the plane to safety, and heads to Meadows Park where Tony is waiting. Once there, they both tell Yusuf that they won't franchise the clubs since they prefer to keep it a \"family business\". As for the diamonds, they in the end are found by a street dweller among a heap of garbage when Luis accidentally bumps into him en route to meeting Tony at Meadows Park.Trivia See Also External Links Vehicles in The Ballad of Gay Tony  This is a list of vehicles are exclusive to or modified in The Ballad of Gay Tony, the second and final episode for Grand Theft Auto IV.

He is also mentioned by Lester Crest\u00a0and\u00a0Patrick McReary in Grand Theft Auto V. The player can choose Niko Bellic as their parent model in Grand Theft Auto Online. Niko grew up in Yugoslavia, where he fought in the Yugoslav Wars. He later worked for organized crime syndicates as a hired-gun in Liberty City. Ever since the Yugoslav Wars ended, Niko's main goal in life was to find and kill one of two men: Florian Cravic or Darko Brevic, for one of them betrayed and nearly killed him during the Wars. Niko is the younger cousin of Roman Bellic and the son of Milica Bellic.Biography Early life and family  Niko was born in Yugoslavia in 1978. It was implied that his father was an abusive alcoholic. His mother, Milica Bellic, was unhappy that her son grew up in such a harsh place. In a conversation with Patrick McReary, Niko reveals that he had a brother who died during the Bosnian War. According to the dialogue in the mission Taking in the Trash, Niko dreamed of becoming an astronaut when he was a child. In a conversation with Dwayne Forge, Niko mentions the house where he grew up in did not have electricity until he was twelve. In a conversation with Kate McReary, Niko says that he found out his aunt (Roman's mother) was raped and murdered, some time after Roman's departure to the United States. Knowing Roman would be even more devastated if he knew the true circumstances of his mother's death, Niko covered up what happened, telling him that she died in a house fire.Bosnian Wars  Niko grew up in the harsh environment of the Yugoslav Wars, and was a teenage soldier of presumably the Serb-controlled Yugoslav People's Army or its many aligned Serbian paramilitary forces and militias fighting against the government forces of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Bosnian Croat Croatian Defence Council. (The Yugoslav Wars were fought between 1991 and 2001, which means that Niko was only 13-21 years old at the time). Niko says that he was betrayed \"ten years ago\", making it closer to 1997 or 1998 (although Florian claims that it was \"twelve or thirteen years ago\" in a phone call after the mission That Special Someone). He served as a helicopter pilot and an infantryman during the war, and during the mission Easy Fare, Roman alludes to him driving a tank. During the war, Niko both witnessed and committed numerous atrocities, which led to his cynical perspective on life, and a certain degree of regret, depression, and emotional detachment. Eventually, Niko's unit of fifteen men (most of them friends from his hometown) were ambushed by enemy forces, but Darko Brevic, Florian Cravic, and Niko himself survived. Niko concluded that either Florian or Darko had sold the group out, and he vowed to uncover and kill the culprit, not only to gain revenge, but also to hopefully 'close the book' on the incident, and move on with his life.Post-war life  Niko had trouble finding steady work after the war. Niko's cousin, Roman, had already moved to America to start a new life in Liberty City while\u00a0Niko spends the next decade working in the European criminal underworld, leading to a period of incarceration in a European penitentiary. After his release from prison,\u00a0he began working for a human trafficking ring led by Ray Bulgarin; when a boat involved in the operation sank in the Adriatic Sea during a smuggling run into Italy, Niko swam to safety, but everything and everyone else was lost. Bulgarin believed that Niko had intentionally scuttled the ship and stole his money; the gangster's reach was too great within Europe, so Niko joined the merchant navy to escape Bulgarin's influence. During Roman's Sorrow, Niko reminds Roman of an occasion in Europe where they encountered a bar which had burned down and there was only one bottle of vodka left, so they sat down and finished it off.Events of GTA IV  Niko spent seven months on the cargo ship Platypus, which eventually smuggled Niko into Liberty City. During the game, Niko says he moved to Liberty City because he wanted a new life by living the American Dream, but when he does arrive in Liberty City, he has nothing except Roman. Niko parted ways with Hossan and the Platypus crew there, partly to reunite with his cousin, and partly to track down Florian Cravic, who had moved to Liberty City after the war. Roman had been boasting of great success in Liberty City, but in truth, his assets amounted to a small, gritty taxi depot and a derelict apartment, and he was saddled with heavy debts due to his gambling habit. Niko would assist Roman in his taxi business, and protect his cousin from the loan sharks who were harassing him. Roman's connections eventually led to Niko making friends with Little Jacob,\u00a0and\u00a0taking work from the Russian Mafia, setting in motion the events of the game. After killing Vladimir Glebov, Niko is spared by Mikhail Faustin, although Dimitri Rascalov wanted him and Roman killed. After killing Mikhail, Dimitri reveals his connections with Ray Bulgarin and turns against him, even trying to kill him. Niko and Roman flee Hove Beach when their apartment and Roman's taxi depot were burned down. It is at this point that Niko becomes a hitman and an associate of many. Mallorie Bardas, Roman's girlfriend, introduce him to two contacts, Manny Escuela\u00a0and Elizabeta Torres.\u00a0Niko\u00a0develops affiliations and becomes a worker of the McReary Family, Playboy X, Dwayne Forge, and the Pegorino Family, to name a few, over the course of the game. Maximizing his hatred of Dimitri, Rascalov gets Roman kidnapped. Niko eventually becomes in forced contact with an International Affairs Agency front under the name of\u00a0United Liberty Paper, who blackmails him into doing some \"country-protecting\" work. Also, Ray Boccino managed to help Niko find Florian Cravic. When Niko confronts him, Florian, who nows calls himself Bernie Crane, begs for forgiveness and claims he is not only a homosexual but that he is not the one who betrayed Niko (despite escaping). Niko forgives him and actually begins helping Bernie with his life. As a sign of gratitude towards Niko for his work with them, the U.L.P. locate Darko Brevic in Romania and smuggle him into Liberty City. Niko confronts Brevic, who confesses that he sold Niko's army unit out for $1,000, which he used to fund his heroin addiction. Enraged at the fact his unit were betrayed for such a paltry sum, Niko holds Brevic at gunpoint. Whether Niko kills Brevic or not depends on the player's actions. After his confrontation with Brevic, Niko meets Jimmy Pegorino again. Pegorino asks Niko to do a heroin deal with Dimitri Rascalov. Niko is reluctant to do so, because of the bitterness between himself and Rascalov. The conclusion of the storyline depends on the player's decision.Deal  If the player chooses to do the deal with Rascalov, he will betray Niko again and send a hitman to assassinate Niko at his cousin's wedding. Niko survives and eventually kills the assassin, though his cousin Roman is killed during the shootout. Enraged by this, Niko chases Rascalov, who killed Jimmy Pegorino, throughout the city before confronting and killing him on Happiness Island.Revenge  If the player chooses to take revenge on Rascalov, Niko fights his way onto the Platypus ship, which Rascalov is loading with heroin, and confronts Rascalov over his earlier betrayal of Niko. Niko executes Rascalov, which leads to the downfall of the Pegorino family. Angered at Niko's betrayal, Pegorino attempts to assassinate him in a drive-by shooting at Roman Bellic's wedding, but instead kills Niko's girlfriend Kate McReary. To avenge Kate's death, Niko, along with his friend Jacob Hughes, chases Pegorino throughout the city before confronting and killing him on Happiness Island.Life Post-GTA IV  If Niko chooses to do the deal\u00a0with Dimitri, Niko likely gives up his life of crime and stays close to his friends as they are there for him. Also, Niko says to Mallorie that her child will need not to worry about being fatherless, hinting Niko will help take care of her child and assume a fatherly role. If Niko chooses to seek Revenge\u00a0on Dimitri, Niko's possible love interest, Kate is killed though he is still able to have a date such as Alexandra Chilton, Carmen Ortiz or Kiki Jenkins and keep in contact with his cousin and friends. He most likely gives up his life of crime and tries to live a normal one\u00a0with Roman, as is hinted by the comments made about him in Grand Theft Auto V.Grand Theft Auto V  Not much is known about Niko's life during the events of Grand Theft Auto V. It is hinted that he has completely given up a life of crime, and has now retired. While setting up for the first heist, Lester Crest mentioned to Michael De Santa that he knew \"an Eastern European guy making moves in Liberty City\", but dismissed the idea as \"he went quiet\". This would hint that he'd continued his life as a career criminal for a few more years before leaving it, especially if he was able to gain such notoriety as recently as of 2013. Later while on a heist, if\u00a0Packie\u00a0was chosen for the job, he begins talking about his most successful job\u00a0in\u00a0Liberty City, and then mentions Niko, revealing that he doesn't even know what became of him, and that he is \"probably dead\". It is possible though that Niko has cut all ties to his previous criminal lifestyle and is retired. If Michael survives the game, one potential scenario in his house sees his family gathered around the dining room table. Jimmy, Michael's son, is viewing a Lifeinvader page on a laptop. By using a camera to zoom in, the page is revealed to be that of Niko Bellic, complete with an image of the character. He now lives in Broker, still working as a taxi driver for Bellic Cab Service, and still in contact with\u00a0Mallorie Bardas, Little Jacob, and Brucie Kibbutz who all liked his latest status, and a Happy Birthday note for\u00a0Roman which was posted recently. Either the Revenge ending was the canonical ending of GTA IV, or this was simply an easter egg. A wanted poster for Niko can be seen on the porch of a house just west of Sandy Shores. This, with his Lifeinvader activity, leaves the possibility that Niko may still be alive. During the \"Got Your Back\" private taxi fare, an Emperor sedan may spawn with the license plate \"NIKOB\".Overview Appearance  Niko has brown hair and hazel eyes. He has facial hair that resembles a \"scruffy\" looking 5 o'clock shadow, which fits his 'thug' appearance very well. Niko isn't as heavily muscled as Luis or Johnny and he's more slender than both of them. Still, Niko has enough physical strength to hold his own in a fistfight and he's capable of pulling himself up on a ledge after hanging by his straight arms. Several characters throughout the story call Niko \"big guy\" or \"big man\", which likely means that he is of tall stature and/or heavy build. Niko has a scar running through his left brow. He most likely got the scar during the war, however, this has not been confirmed. Niko's body is of 'average' build, but characters like Bernie Crane mention that \"Niko is still in great shape.\" Later, Bernie asks if Niko works out, to which Niko answers he doesn't work out but his dangerous lifestyle keeps him active. People consider him to be \"above average\" build despite his slender appearance.Beta  In artworks and earlier screenshots, Niko had often been seen wearing finger-less gloves. The files still remain in the PC version and can only be used with an in-game trainer. Obtaining them in the game without modding is impossible. The reason why they have been removed from the final version of the game is unknown, but it is likely due to the fact that they are not very inconspicuous. In early beta versions of GTA IV, Niko had slightly thicker hair and sometimes he can be seen with a buzz cut, neither of which appear in GTA IV, but still exist in the game files.Personality and traits  Niko is very protective of his family and loved ones, particularly his cousin Roman, whom Niko constantly has to worry about due to his gambling habit. Roman has an indiscrete nature of frequently getting the pair into trouble. He is withdrawn among strangers, but has good manners, and shows a softer side with love interests like Kate McReary and Michelle. That said, the horrors of war, both witnessed and perpetrated by Niko, have given him a great sense of guilt, and an ambivalence about the value of human life \u2014 he warns away pursuers and expresses regret over his past violence, but also feels that killing is all that he can do, readily taking on jobs which necessarily involve murder. Niko is prone to violence after being angered and he has an explosive temper when he is betrayed, manipulated, or his loyalty is questioned, but he is also quick to help the defenseless and unfortunate, even those he merely meets in passing; he apparently possesses a sense of idealism which was wounded by his wartime experiences. Unfortunately, such a split attitude leads to hypocrisy \u2014 Niko, for example, appears to genuinely sympathize with the McRearys' grief over the demise of one of their brothers (either Derrick McReary or Francis McReary), despite having secretly committed that murder himself. This makes it highly possible that Niko is a pessimist. Niko's bitterness at the murder of his friends during the war has consumed him, and he is unable to let it go, taking on several highly dangerous jobs merely to enable his quest for vengeance. Several of his friends, most notably Roman, urge him to find a new reason to live, and there are many morality choices for Niko to emphasize his trait. Niko's business-like manner usually leads him to behave more maturely and cautiously than his acquaintances, although with acquaintances like Brucie Kibbutz, Bernie Crane and Roman, this is no surprise. He has an apparent distaste for illegal drugs, much like Carl Johnson and Victor Vance. He frequently turns down Little Jacob's offers for marijuana and warns Packie about his cocaine habit. He also finds it distasteful to traffic in cocaine and particularly heroin, although this may be due to the heavy jail sentences they attract as much as any moral qualms. He is skeptical of American mainstream culture, which he sees as \"shallow\" and \"hypocritical\" and has trouble relating to Roman's fascination with the country. However, he reasons that being in America is far better than back in Serbia due to the country's instability and misery. Niko also exhibits dislike for American conservative politicians, whom he considers to be hypocrites. An example is Bryce Dawkins, whom Niko says is a \"bullshitter\" for giving homophobic speeches and preaching about family values to gain political power when he himself is bisexual. However, a conversation between Niko and Kiki Jenkins reveals he considers himself neither liberal nor conservative, and that the war gave him a highly cynical view of politicians in general. Niko has a certain degree of empathy for other people, even random strangers, and feels obliged to help others who cannot help themselves. Most missions involve Niko doing jobs for money, particularly one occasion. After meeting a troubled young girl, Marnie Allen, he even gives her some of his own money multiple times to help her out.\u00a0 He is also surprisingly calm when speaking to authority figures, even those as powerful as Francis McReary, who he simply asks for more money from, much to the disappointment and frustration of McReary.\u00a0He is usually never emotionally disturbed by anyone besides figures from his past, such as Darko Brevic.\u00a0 If Niko kills Brevic, Niko will hesitate for a moment before unloading 12 shots (one for every member of Niko's army unit who was killed) into Brevic's body uncontrollably, even after Brevic's death after about the sixth shot.\u00a0The only other figure that has visibly disturbed Niko is Eddie Low, who Niko is understandably creeped out by.\u00a0 This can even horrify the player to an extent, such as when Low makes\u00a0comments about all the people he has murdered in gruesome ways, or Low's clinginess towards Niko for being his 'friend'.\u00a0 During his encounters with Low, Niko's eyebrows are raised and his mouth is open in disbelief.\u00a0 Otherwise, Niko's face is usually very serious. Niko almost always refuses alcohol when it is offered to him (he asks for water in the mission Ivan The Not So Terrible) except for the mission The Holland Play where Playboy X pours him a glass. Niko goes to drink it, but changes his mind and puts the glass on a table. There is a scene where Niko does drink a glass of vodka (on the rocks) in the mission One Last Thing, while talking to Jimmy Pegorino, but this is understandable considering what he had just been through. Niko does seem to enjoy a drink, but knows the time and place for it. He refuses alcohol outright in instances where he needs to keep a sharp mind, such as during missions. Without the player's control, Niko will never hit female pedestrians. For example, when Niko carjacks someone, the animation can sometimes see him punch or kick the occupant of the car, but he only does this to male drivers. If the driver is female, Niko will just pull her out of the car and not harm her.Naming, errors and language  The name \"Niko\" means nobody or nothing in the Serbo-Croatian language. The surname \"Bellic\" would not exist in that language, as it does not allow consecutive consonants (i.e., the double-L in \"Bellic\"); \"Bellic\" is also pronounced with a hard 'c' (/bel-lik/) throughout the game \u2014 Niko himself uses the incorrect pronunciation when introducing himself to the receptionist  at Goldberg, Ligner and Shyster in the mission Final Interview. A proper pronunciation would use a hard 'ch' (/belich/, as used in-game with the names \"Darko Brevic\" and \"Florian Cravic\"); a more authentic rendering of Niko's surname would be 'Belic'. At one point, Florian, speaking in his native Serbo-Croatian, pronounces the name correctly; \"Bellic\" may simply be an Anglicised version of \"Belic\". Going by that custom, Niko's real\u00a0name may be Nikola Beli\u0107. The surname \"Bellic\" is likely derived from Russian rather than Serbian, which is incorrect. The first name \"Niko\" is distinctively of Croatian origin rather than Serbian, the latter one preferring the name \"Nikola\". In the mission Final Interview, Tom Goldberg refers to Niko as \"Nikolai\", although this is an assumption on his part \u2014 he begins their interview by saying, \"Hello, Niko! What's that short for? Nikolai?\" Niko does not respond and no one else calls him \"Nikolai\" in the game. Niko's voice actor, Michael Hollick, is American, and the accent he assumes for Niko is not a Serbian one; Niko's spoken Serbo-Croatian is frequently mispronounced or wrongly emphasised. Additionally, Niko's mother writes in a language similar to Serbo-Croatian.In Other Media Initial Inspiration  Niko appears to be visually inspired by Sasha from the 2001 movie Behind Enemy Lines, which takes place in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the war. Sasha's clothes are even available to buy in the Russian Shop. Sasha's actor Vladimir Mashkov\u00a0later confirmed in an interview that he was asked to play \"a man with a dark past, with a slightly rumpled appearance\" in an unnamed video game, whose producers liked his performance as Sasha. Given few de\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200btails about what he was being asked to do or what for, Mashkov thought it was a questionable proposal and not very interesting, and he turned it down. Only later did he learn that the game was GTA IV.Popularity  Niko was voted 13th in the 2011 edition of the Guinness World Records for the Top 50 favorite game characters. His name was incorrectly spelled \"Nico Bellic.\"Grand Theft Auto Online  Niko Bellic is available as a special parent, used in creating the player's custom character, alongside Misty, Claude and John Marston from Red Dead Redemption.Appearances Grand Theft Auto IV The Lost and Damned The Ballad of Gay Tony GTA Online Characters murdered by Niko Bellic  Main Article: Murders Committed by Niko BellicHeinous crimes committed by Niko Bellic Other Crimes Committed (player-determinant) Trivia Missions in GTA IV  The following is a list of missions featured in Grand Theft Auto IV. For a list of missions in The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony, see Missions in The Lost and Damned and Missions in The Ballad of Gay Tony. In the game, many missions are available at the same time from multiple characters, so this list does not reflect any required chronological order of completion. Each character's respective missions, however, can only be completed in the order listed. And, of course, some characters and their respective missions may not be unlocked until certain missions are completed. The list is done in a logical order in which it can lock chronologically with The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony. In total, there are 88 story missions, which are the following:Broker-Dukes-Bohan Missions  There are 34 missions total in Broker-Dukes and Bohan (27 in Broker-Dukes, 7 in Bohan).

Like in GTA San Andreas, two of the girlfriends are introduced during the storyline. The other three girlfriends are met online from the dating websites, as www.lovemeet.net and www.craplist.net. Aside from the amusing interactions between Niko Bellic and the women he dates, there can be several in-game benefits to starting a relationship with any of the datable characters. Putting in a little bit of time to raise the fondness of the girlfriends can unlock their \"special abilities\": these can help in particularly difficult missions late in the game. Like the other relationships that Niko has with his friends in GTA IV, favor can be gained with girlfriends by taking them to different venues around the city. Unlike the male friends, however, dating is more than just worrying about the venue. To have a successful date Niko must cater to the women's tastes in three areas; clothing, vehicle, and how fancy the date is. Each woman has different tastes and will respond accordingly. Reaching 100% fondness with all five girlfriends is not required to achieve 100% completion of the game.Internet Girlfriends  After the mission Out of the Closet for Brucie Kibbutz, dates can be set up online through www.love-meet.net or www.craplist.net. 12-24 in-game hours after contacting the girl, she sends Niko an email. The date and time of the first date will be added to the organizer in Niko's phone. The first date is very important as it will determine whether or not the girlfriend will give Niko her phone number so he can continue dating her. If an Internet girlfriend's fondness is raised to a high enough level, her \"special ability\" is unlocked. If Niko Bellic has a bad date or does not ask to come inside, the girl dumps Niko. However, wait a few in-game days and they reappear on the site so Niko can try again. When Niko meets a girlfriend again after being dumped or dumping her they will act as if they had never met him, Sometimes they will refuse to let Niko in, But thankfully if one of them do, they will still share a kiss before they go back into their house.Ballad of Gay Tony  Main Article:Booty Call There are ten \"girlfriends\" that Luis Lopez can have in The Ballad of Gay Tony. Luis is able to dance with them in the clubs and if he does well they'll bring Luis to the restrooms for an encounter, after which they may give Luis their number. Afterwards, they can be contacted, or may contact Luis, for a \"booty call\". There are ten Luis \"girlfriends\" including:Damageproofing Vehicles  A glitch in the game can make any vehicle damage proof by scaring Niko's date right when she gets in the vehicle (however these properties can randomly disappear at any time). To do the trick, fire a weapon when Niko's date gets in the car (wait for both door-opening and seating animations to pass). Or with a helicopter, snap off the blades at a height where Niko's girlfriend can get hurt but won't die.One-handed Driving  Another glitch in the game will make Niko drive one-handed if he says goodbye after a successful date instead of asking to come inside. Niko's right arm will be at his side, usually clipping through parts of the car in between the seats. To rectify this, make Niko call someone or get out and back in the car.The Lost and Damned  Grand Theft Auto: The Lost and Damned Main Theme Grand Theft Auto: The Lost and Damned (TLAD) is the first of two episodes of downloadable content for Grand Theft Auto IV on the PlayStation 3, PC and Xbox 360. This episode features a new storyline, with a new protagonist - Johnny Klebitz, of The Lost\u00a0Outlaw Motorcycle Club. The game was first released as a download on Xbox Live on February 17, 2009 as an \"Xbox 360 exclusive\". However, recently, in GTA IV's fourth PC patch, The Lost and Damned's achievements were added to the PC version. At first, The Lost and Damned along with the second piece of downloadable content, The Ballad of Gay Tony, were to be released to the PS3 and PC on March 30, 2010, but due to Sony Computer Entertainment wanting to edit some of the radio stations, it was released on April 13 in North America and April 16 in Europe. The Lost and Damned received critical acclaim, holding 90/100 (Xbox) and 88/100 (PS3) on Metacritic, and 89% (Xbox) and 94% (PS3 and PC) on GameRankings.Overview  The episode features new missions, multiplayer modes, weapons, vehicles, and music/radio shows. It became available for download via Xbox LIVE and PlayStation Network and costs $9.99 or 800 Microsoft Points. It is part of a disc-based title, \"Grand Theft Auto: Episodes From Liberty City\", which does not need a GTA IV disc to be played and is bundled along with the second episodic content, The Ballad of Gay Tony, for $39.99 (around \u00a325.00) \"Johnny is a very different character than Niko, with a very different background,\" says Dan Houser, vice president of creative development for Rockstar Games. \"I can't go into too much detail on the story, because we try not to give away too much plot before the game is released. But I can say that the story will show you a different side of Liberty City.\" \"The story is not directly impacted by decisions you took in the main game,\" he says. However, \"tons of details and mysteries from the main story get explained, so it will add a lot of color to the main story.\" The storylines for GTA IV, The Lost and Damned, and The Ballad of Gay Tony were written by Dan Houser and Rupert Humphries. All three storylines occur within the same timeframe, and occasionally intertwine with each other.Synopsis  The Lost and Damned's plot and tone consists of a dark, gritty storyline revolving around the actions and lifestyle of members of The Lost Motorcycle Club, which operates in Alderney and Liberty City. Billy Grey is the president of the club, who is the most reckless of all and leads the others in a stubborn refusal of rational methodology (even in the case of Johnny, when Billy frowns upon him for making peace with the Angels of Death. While the main protagonist, Johnny Klebitz, is battling rivals across Liberty City beside their gang he also associates with wealthy political congressmen, lower-class bikers and drug pushers, emphasizing the distinction between upper and lower class in America. The Lost own a clubhouse and mostly patrol throughout Alderney, North Algonquin, and South Bohan. Labeled as the most dangerous threats to personal safety in Liberty City, the Lost partake in drinking and drug abuse, gang shootouts, illegal racing, drug distribution, mere prostitution and motorcycle thefts. When Johnny Klebitz and his fellow bikers feel compelled to \"put this place out of its misery\" by burning it to the ground, it symbolizes the end of the Lost motorcycle club, as the pressures of authority, government, territorial gangs, and members either double-crossing the gang or becoming killed by the dozens prove that the club can no longer function from the enemies it has gained. Characters: As read in the booklet included with Episodes from Liberty City: Across the West River from glamorous Algonquin lies Alderney; home to industrial wastelands, strip malls, dreary suburbia and The Lost Brotherhood, a notorious biker gang along with band of thieves, murderers and drug-runners. The Lost have sworn to live by their own rules, above the law and in complete allegiance to the brotherhood. Billy Grey, the clubs President, has one set of priorities: Bikes, Booze, Babes and Blow; in any order and preferably all at the same time. His second-in-command, Johnny Klebitz, knows that time is running out for this gang of outlaws, and with money to be made in Liberty City, he is determined to make cash as quickly as possible before they all ride off into the sunset. Johnny has been in control of the club while Billy serves out a court-ordered stint in rehab. He has focused the gang\u2019s activities on deals and truces, instead of petty vendettas, and has been making good inroads into Liberty City's organized crime world, even developing a working business relationship with the Angels of Death, long-term rivals of The Lost. One problem. Billy's coming home, and he's crazier than ever...Story  Johnny Klebitz, Vice President of the Alderney chapter of The Lost MC, has been busy protecting the gang's business interests in Liberty City, and is loyal to the chapter president, Billy Grey, who was recently sent to rehab for heroin addiction after narrowly avoiding a fifteen-year sentence in prison. When Billy returns, his violent actions towards the gang's rivals, the Angels of Death, causes a previously established truce to be broken between the two gangs, threatening the Brotherhood's survival. Johnny also works with Jim Fitzgerald to further sabotage Angels of Death business at the behest of Billy Grey, which includes stealing Angels of Death bikes to be sold for parts and blowing up Angels of Death vans with pipe bombs. They briefly have problems with Jimmy Matthews and Ed McCornish, corrupt police officers who are attempting to extort them due to the stolen bikes, and later lure them into a death trap set by the Lost, killing them and their corrupt LCPD colleagues. To further complicate matters, Jason Michaels, a recently patched-in member of the Lost MC, is killed in Broker during an attack on members of the Lost by the Angels of Death. Billy uses the opportunity to convince Johnny that the AoD were responsible for the murder, rather than the actual killer. In retaliation, the gang attacks the Angels of Death clubhouse and secures a large amount of heroin. The gang attempts to sell the heroin through drug dealer Elizabeta Torres, but the buyer turns out to be an undercover cop. Following the botched deal, Billy introduces Johnny to Thomas Stubbs III (who Billy meets through his lawyer, Dave Grossman), a corrupt Congressman who pays Johnny to help him stay on top politically. Eventually, Johnny's friend and Treasurer of the Lost Brotherhood, Jim Fitzgerald, learns that the heroin was stolen from the Triads by the Angels of Death, so the gang attempts to sell it back to them, only to be betrayed. The police\u00a0capture Billy, who is sent back to prison. Following Billy's arrest, Johnny becomes the chapter's new president. However Brian Jeremy, the Club Secretary refuses to follow, having been fiercely loyal to Billy and blaming Johnny for his arrest. Brian attempts to ambush Johnny and his loyalists using a peace meeting at the docks as a ruse, sending members of his rebel faction after them, and so Johnny is forced to later ambush Brian and members of his rebel faction at his safehouse, either killing or sparing him. In order to keep the gang afloat, Johnny begins working with people such as Uptown Riders members Malc and DeSean, and is forced to get his ex-girlfriend, Ashley Butler out of trouble on two separate occasions: rescuing her from violent drug addicts at a condemned housing project in North Holland, and kidnapping Roman Bellic at the behest of Dimitri Rascalov, to whom Ashley owes money. Johnny eventually comes to help out\u00a0Pegorino Family capo Ray Boccino at the recommendation of his ex-girlfriend, Ashley. Through Ray, Johnny steals a large amount of diamonds from Gay Tony and attempts to sell them to the Jewish Mafia with the help of Niko Bellic, however the deal fails after Mori Green is gunned down by a sniper, who reclaims the diamonds, and so Johnny manages to escape with the money, after dealing with Ray's henchmen, planning to keep it for the Brotherhood. An angry Ray kidnaps Jim and tortures him while holding Johnny at gunpoint, but the two escape. Johnny fights off several hitmen working for Ray and ultimately learns from Ashley outside the Lost MC Clubhouse that Jim was killed by one of Ray's men. He plans to attack Ray but is told by Stubbs not to, who reckons that Ray Boccino will either be \"locked up or dead within a month\" and so instead focuses on Billy, who has agreed to testify against Johnny and Angus Martin so that he may be freed from prison. Johnny, Terry Thorpe, Clay Simons and other members of the Lost infiltrate the prison and Johnny personally executes Billy. Afterward, the remnants of the Lost burn the clubhouse down, as it has sustained heavy damage due to the conflict with Ray Boccino. The group stands in front of the burning building contemplating the future. Later, Ashley phones Johnny and tells him she's admitting herself to rehab, with Johnny wishing her the best.Reception  The Lost and Damned received critical acclaim from critics; The Episode's Xbox version holds 90, while the PS3 version holds 88 on MetaCritic. On GameRankings, the Xbox version holds 89.81%, while both the PS3 and PC version hold 94%. Many minor critics awarded the DLC with perfect scores, including AceGamez, Level7.nu, DarkStation, Total Video Games and G4 TV. X360 Magazine UK gave the DLC a perfect 10/10, stating \"[The] Lost and Damned is an absolute behemoth of an expansion, providing a fresh perspective on the same city and setting a devilishly high standard for DLC in the future\". GameTrailers gave the game a 9.2/10, stating \"One of the most robust pieces of downloadable content we've ever seen. We're used to getting a handful of hours, but we were surprised again and again that the missions just kept on coming. There's a certain level of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu involved and more mission variety would be appreciated, but the new multiplayer options are practically worth the price of admission alone\". GamesRadar awarded TLAD with a 9/10, stating \"the story and acting are great, the missions are enjoyable and riding around on the retooled bikes is the most fun it's been in any GTA since Vice City. It's not going to change the minds of any Niko-haters, but anyone itching to delve back into Liberty City should grab it now\". The Official Xbox Magazine UK gave the DLC a 9/10, stating \"for the price, it's unmissable, and it proves that Liberty City can support far more than the two pieces of DLC Rockstar has committed to\". IGN gave TLAD a 9/10, stating \"If the story and new characters were better, this would be the perfect $20 download. But as it stands, it's still the best available by a long shot.\" Game Informer, GamePro and GameSpy all gave the game a 9/10, praising its gameplay. 1UP.com awarded the DLC a B+ (83/100 on Metacritic). Eurogamer and Destructoid were less favorable towards the DLC, with both critics awarding it with 8/10.Trivia External links Infernus  The Infernus is a supercar that was first introduced in Grand Theft Auto III and has appeared in every GTA title since (except Grand Theft Auto Advance) and has gained a reputation for being one of the oldest sports cars to still be in a vast number of GTA titles. It is manufactured by Pegassi in the HD Universe.Design 3D Universe  Between Grand Theft Auto III and Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories, the Infernus has appeared in three different forms, each illustrating the car as a sleek, low-profile sports car comparable to the Cheetah. In Grand Theft Auto III and Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories, it is a cross resemblance between a Jaguar XJR-15 and a XJ220. In Grand Theft Auto: Vice City and Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories, it closely resembles a Lamborghini Countach, but lacks the characteristic swing-up doors, and features bulged headlights and rounded taillights. In Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, the Infernus strikingly resembles the first generation Honda NSX and Cizeta-Moroder V16T, which is the original design of the Lamborghini Diablo prototype before it was changed by Chrysler. Its front bumper and rear bumper both resemble the Chevrolet Corvette Coupe Export Model. Although the Infernus' design suggests an RMR layout in GTA III and GTA Liberty City Stories, its engine is visible under the front hood, possibly due to limitations of the game engine. The GTA Vice City and GTA Vice City Stories renditions reposition the engine to the back, as the front compartment is revealed to be the trunk. The GTA Vice City Infernus, however, still emits smoke from the front when damaged. The GTA San Andreas Infernus stays in a front mounted engine, all wheel drive layout. In GTA San Andreas, the Infernus can be modified at any TransFender modification garage.Grand Theft Auto IV  The Grand Theft Auto IV rendition, manufactured by Pegassi, is largely based on the first generation Lamborghini Murci\u00e9lago combined with the side-paneling of a Lamborghini Diablo (most notably the side windows) and the rear fascia and venting off an early model Pagani Zonda and Spyker C8.\u00a0The car also features a rear-mid rear configuration. The Infernus may spawn with a rear spoiler as an extra. It is capable of supporting a second body color for a stripe over the side skirts, though it is not utilized on any standard car. The Infernus in GTA IV is also the first car in the series to feature non-standard doors. The doors appear to reflect the design of Lamborghini doors, known as scissor doors, however they also appear to rotate away from the vehicle body, unlike the standard scissor-door design and purpose. This design trait allows the Infernus' doors to be self-closing, relying on gravity to fall shut from its opened position. Also featured are small, racing-style wing mirrors. The interior is fully finished in black leather and sports the same Lamborghini-style sport seats as the Comet. Sections of the dash and transmission tunnel are finished with carbon fiber accents. The Infernus is the most expensive car in GTA IV with a price tag of $150,000, followed by the Turismo with a price tag of $130,000 and the Super GT with a price tag of $110,000.Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars  The Infernus in Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars is only available without a spoiler, and features conventional doors. In addition, players who pre-ordered GTA Chinatown Wars from Amazon are able to purchase a bulletproof Infernus from the Auto merchant earlier on in the game.Grand Theft Auto V  The Infernus in Grand Theft Auto V appears to be unchanged from Grand Theft Auto IV except for the rim and interior design. The rims on the Infernus match the rims used on the Lamborghini Revent\u00f3n, a limited production car based on the Murci\u00e9lago. It also has a new, red interior, though only in the last-gen version of the game; the enhanced version shares its predominantly-black interior with the Furore GT and Comet. Unlike the GTA IV version, the Infernus can be modified with some parts such as the rear wing and exhausts.Performance 3D Universe  The Infernus' handling remains similar between GTA III and GTA Vice City, but in San Andreas, it seems to be the fastest vehicle in the game (followed by the Turismo and the Bullet), and its all wheel drive system means the car has good front grip. However, the car suffers from understeer due to its small wheels and wheel wells. Caution must be ensured when braking as the wheels usually lock up during high speed braking. Power distribution is considered smooth, but due to its high power output, moderation must be used when taking turns, otherwise fishtailing may ensue. Its suspension in GTA III and GTA Vice City, however, is softer, allowing it to drive over curbs without jolting the car substantially or bottoming out. Additionally, the drag multiplier is only 1, which means it is the most aerodynamic sports car in the game. This probably answers why it is often a bit difficult to handle. One of the downsides of the car, is its low durabilty, as it catches fire only after a few collisions. In GTA Vice City Stories, the Infernus is equipped with an AWD drivetrain (20% front, 80% rear torque distribution), and what sounds like a supercharged engine. With such speed and power, it is great for cruising along the beach, although its turning radius will suffer. The AWD drivetrain can be easily seen by flipping the car over; switching between the hand-brake and regular brakes, while applying gas.Grand Theft Auto IV  The Infernus returns retaining its renowned performance of high speed and acceleration. It is highly susceptible to deformation from high-speed impacts, due to its light body construction and rear mounted engine. Windshield Ejection is also common due to the lack of substance in the front of the car. The Infernus is one of the best racing cars, but does suffer from understeer during high speed turns. It is laid out in a mid-engined all-wheel drive layout, like most Lamborghinis. The mid-engine configuration makes it unlikely to break down or be set aflame from front-end collisions. It is also good at performing quick J-Turns. In GTA IV, the Infernus shares its engine sound with the Comet and the Super GT. It also tends to backfire, like the Banshee, Buffalo, F620, Sultan RS, and Bullet GT. The in-game engine model is not very detailed, and cannot fully reveal the engine cylinder configuration, however, it can be said to be a V8, as it shares the same base model as the Bullet (which has a V8 model), except it has silver cam covers, with \"Infernus\" engraved into them.Grand Theft Auto V  Returning in GTA V, the Infernus retains its high-performing engine but exchanges understeer for oversteer and general poor stability. As before, it has excellent acceleration and speed due to the AWD drivetrain and what sounds to be a high-revving, high-power engine, but attempting to corner while letting off of the accelerator and not braking will cause wild spinouts and general loss of control. To counter this, the player must always keep either the accelerator or the brakes on throughout the turn. The mid-engine layout provides some measure of resistance against accidents and bullets but otherwise its durability is disappointing, as its wheels can make a positive camber very easily when having side-on crashes. Again, like GTA IV, the engine is very undetailed and cannot fully reveal the cylinder configuration, however the website states that is a 6 liter engine capable of pushing 610hp.Modifications Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Prominent Appearances in Missions Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories The Lost and Damned Notable Owners Grand Theft Auto III Grand Theft Auto: Vice City and Vice City Stories Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Grand Theft Auto IV Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars Special Variants Grand Theft Auto III  In GTA III, D-Ice is known to own a unique pear-red or metallic blue Infernus. In the mission where the player has to drive it to a garage to defuse a bomb in it, he can save it in a garage, but only by failing the mission. This car is also seen in the mission Grand Theft Auto.Grand Theft Auto: Vice City and Vice City Stories  In GTA Vice City, Lance Vance is depicted to be driving a uniquely white Infernus, which can be seen and driven during Back Alley Brawl and Guardian Angels. After obtaining Diaz's mansion in Rub Out, the regular Infernus parked next to the garage will permanently appear white, implying the car belongs to Lance. Given its permanence, the car is easily and always obtainable from this point on. The White Infernus reappears in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories at Lance Vance's Apartment in Ocean Beach after the mission From Zero To Hero. Other Infernuses can be seen with the same color driving around the city. It was later destroyed by members of the Mendez Cartel using a rocket launcher during the mission Light My Pyre, although it still spawns at the apartment after the mission.Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas  in GTA San Andreas, B Dup has a full immune Infernus. To get it, start the mission Beat Down on B Dup, bring a tractor or Monster Truck (Monster Truck recommended) park it somewhere safe, take over Glen Park like normal, then park the monster or tractor on the road next to the two sidewalk grooves outside B Dup's Apartment. It should flip the Infernus during the final cutscene. After that, push it to a garage.Grand Theft Auto IV Locations Grand Theft Auto III Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories Grand Theft Auto IV Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars Grand Theft Auto V Grand Theft Auto Online Trivia General Grand Theft Auto III Grand Theft Auto: Vice City and Vice City Stories Grand Theft Auto IV Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars Grand Theft Auto V See Also Vehicles in The Lost and Damned  This is a list of vehicles introduced to Grand Theft Auto IV by The Lost and Damned, the first episodic pack. It introduces sixteen new motorcycles and seven new cars and trucks on top of the already large list of vehicles in GTA IV. Bike handling has been improved to encourage bike transportation, making the task of knocking the protagonist Johnny Klebitz off a bike a much harder task and sharp turns easier to make.Vehicles  Before proceeding to edit the vehicle pages, please refer to the Manual of Style/Vehicles to understand the vehicles' page contents.Bikes Four-wheels Notes Random characters  Random characters are minor characters found around the game world with whom the player can interact, often providing the player with a small bonus mission or objective. They have appeared in every game in the HD Universe with the exception of Grand Theft Auto Online.Description GTA IV, EFLC and GTA Chinatown Wars  Their presence is indicated by a small blue person icon on the radar, but only when within close proximity to the player (Usually around 1 block). In The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony upon unlocking the random character's mission, their location will appear on the minimap represented by a white person icon. They provide Niko, Johnny, Luis and Huang\u00a0with small missions. They generally are in some problem and will ask the Protagonist's help. After completing all the random encounters in GTA IV, the achievement/trophy \"No More Strangers\" will be unlocked. Most of the random character missions are required for 100% completion. Though some are not required (like Cherise Glover's, Brian Jeremy, Ivan Bytchkov's, Clarence Little's, and Jeff Harlingford's random encounters).GTA V  In Grand Theft Auto V random characters are known as Strangers and Freaks. They take elements from the Strangers featured in Red Dead Redemption, which means that even after starting one of this side missions, the player is still free to roam around the map and complete other missions. There are a total of 58 Strangers and Freaks missions, though only a specific 20 of them are required for 100% Completion.External Links See also  There's a few more types of distinguished random people:Luis Fernando Lopez  Luis Fernando Lopez is a character in the Grand Theft Auto series, appearing as a supporting character\u00a0in Grand Theft Auto IV and The Lost and Damned and the protagonist of The Ballad of Gay Tony. He is also mentioned several times in Grand Theft Auto Online. He is a bodyguard and business associate of Tony Prince.Biography Background Childhood  Luis is of Dominican descent and was raised on Frankfort Avenue of Northwood in Algonquin. His mother is Adriana Yanira Lopez, his brother Ernesto Lopez and his sister Leta Lopez-Wilkinson. His father was a U.S. Marine who abandoned them while they were young. He was raised by his mother, who also had a notable role in the upbringing of Luis' childhood (and current) best friends, Armando Torres and Henrique Bardas. He also grew up with Oscar Gomez and Alonso Gomez, Teddy Benavidez and Willy Valerio, older kids by three years, ushered most of the neighborhood kids into drug dealing. During a drug war, Henrique mentions that Luis used to rap while Henrique \"laid down\" the beat. Henrique claims that Luis was a poor rapper because people used to laugh at him when he would rap. He was also scrawnier in those years, as Armando and Henrique recall. During school, a teacher, had apparently been making fun of Luis' sister, and in retaliation Luis broke the teacher's arm. Henrique at one point reflects on the time the three of them had stolen liquor from Principal Fischer's office, and claims that detention in their school was almost as bad as prison. When Luis was 17, in 2000, he went to juvenile hall for two years because he shot and injured a teacher who felt up his sister. Armando and Henrique remember spending the summer of 1999 with Luis, meaning it happened during their next school year. Curiously, this does not appear on his criminal record. Not long after his release in 2001, he had been arrested again for grand theft auto. This likely coincides with him taking the blame for a crime committed by Armando and Henrique (neither of whom were caught) and going to prison. During this stint, also two years, he went from being very skinny to being quite muscular. He got his physique by body-building to help against fighting off inmates to keep himself from getting raped or killed. His brother and sister, however, both left Liberty City and started stable lives, married, with children and homes in different small-town suburbs, with little to no interaction with their mother. As a result, she relies on Luis to give her money. Luis got in police trouble a third time in 2003, for assault, but avoided prison. This likely coincides with Luis being arrested alongside Oscar Gomez and Willy Valerio - the LCPD goes on for years thinking Luis is still closely connected to them, while in fact this was one of their last times together.Meeting Gay Tony  In 2005, when Luis was 22, his life changed when he accepted a job from \"Gay\" Tony Prince to be a bodyguard. It wouldn't take long for Tony and Luis to see each other as a sort of father-and-son pair. He cut all remaining ties with his old gang (except Armando and Henrique as friends), and paid his supposed last visit to an illegal cage fighting ring (though he would return). By working for Gay Tony, his life became much more positive, and while he lost respect with old friends who saw him as a yuppie, he was introduced to much more money and glamor. Tony once paid Luis to take helicopter-flying lessons for business purposes (as shown from his Higgins Helitours piloting certificate in his apartment, as well as the Club Management mission with Bruce Spade). Unfortunately, Tony was in debt to several loan sharks across the city such as Mori Kibbutz and Ancelotti family soldato Rocco Pelosi, setting in motions TBoGT's events.Events of The Ballad of Gay Tony  Luis begins doing several jobs for Tony, witnessing the bank robbery, meeting Rocco Pelosi and Uncle Vince in the introduction. He began doing work for his mother and friends (Momma's Boy, Corner Kids and Clocking Off) then began helping Rocco with his work on missions for Tony; he meets multiple gang officials in peace attempts, all of which wage war nearly killing him and Tony. He would then get The Celebinator (...Blog This!) off Tony's back. Tony would introduce him to Yusuf Amir, who got Lopez stealing a Buzzard, APC, a subway train, and killing Tahir Saeed and Ahmed Khalil. He would later work for Mori Kibbutz, one of Tony's loaners; after completing This Ain't Checkers and beating Mori in a Triathlon, he got Tony out of his grasp. Things only turned worse for Tony after a Bahama Mamas meeting in the mission Boulevard Baby also went wrong. Luis, Evan Moss and Gay Tony would later buy $2,000,000 worth of diamonds, but lose them at the hands of Johnny Klebitz, who kills Evan, but was fortunately able to reclaim them that much later. Luis also discovered how Tony had befriended Gracie Ancelotti. Luis began working for Ray Bulgarin, who had him deal with his Marki Ashvilli situation alongside Timur, his right-hand; after discovering how Luis bought diamonds that were claimed to be his, he ambushed and betrayed Lopez by having him witness The Cook's dead head and sending snipers, gunmen and choppers after him. Having left him, Luis gets Tony's attention on this; his life is falling apart now. Thanks to Niko Bellic and Gerald McReary, Gracie Ancelotti is discovered to be kidnapped. Luis, knowing how she pumped Tony with cocaine, refuses to help, but he is ordered by Tony to track her down. When the Ancelotti's, following this mission, fail to reclaim her forcefully, Tony and Luis are forced to give away the diamonds to Niko Bellic and Packie McReary in the mission Ladies Half Price. Luis is later ordered by Rocco to kill Tony in the mission Party's Over, but kills Uncle Vince, and spares Rocco due to Tony's claims that Rocco is a made man, and at the cost of a heavy ambush. He later destroys the heroin and then kills Timur and Ray Bulgarin in Departure Time. In the last cutscene, Luis is thanked by Tony as he 'saved' his business. Then Yusuf arrives and the three talk about what their near futures, as the player is to decide what happens next. It is implied that they finally accepted Yusuf's offer to franchise Maisonette 9 and Hercules, although it is never explicitly stated whether or not this happens.Sex life  Because of his role as a celebrity nightclub bouncer, Luis has the opportunity to socialize and even have casual sex with famous, beautiful women. Some people mentioned during the game that Luis has a small penis. It's unproved, but this blame comes from his lovers, and he gets angry when somebody else talks about that. Gracie and Daisie both playfully tease Luis about being a closeted homosexual.\u00a0 He had been sexually linked to:Murders Committed Optional Murders Heinous crimes committed by Luis Physical appearance  Luis is depicted as a muscular Afro-Latino man in his mid-twenties. He is of light brown complexion with brown eyes and black hair, has a 'high fade' haircut a small bit of facial hair. He also wears an earring on his left ear and has a small tattoo of his own name on his neck. He usually wears a black and white letterman jacket with jeans and white tennis shoes, or expensive suits for club business. He speaks with a New York Latino accent and often mixes in Spanish with his speech. Before he went to prison he was much scrawnier, but the harsh prison lifestyle forced him to build up his body.Personality  Luis is a person who normally keeps his emotions in check, rarely demonstrating his feelings. Despite this, Luis does care for his mother and friends as he was visually struggling to keep his anger toward Mr. Santo from exploding because of his threatening behaviour around his mother. Luis is also very sarcastic and talks back to people when he needs to. He is also more reasonable and careful than most other people, being a perfect foil to the flamboyant, impulsive Tony. Luis also shows clear disdain for the 'street thug' lifestyle that landed him in prison, and criticises Armando and Henrique for still living it. Despite this, he still helps out his old friends with drug deals and they repay him with vehicles and weapons. He also shows clear signs of bitterness for the time he spent in prison, though this is because he had to furiously fight off other inmates.Mission Appearances Trivia Grand Theft Auto V  Grand Theft Auto V Main Theme (Oh No - \"Welcome to Los Santos\") Grand Theft Auto V (also known as Grand Theft Auto Five, GTA 5 or GTA V) is a\u00a0video game developed by Rockstar North. It is the fifteenth instalment in the Grand Theft Auto series and the successor of Grand Theft Auto IV. The original edition was released on September 17th, 2013 for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. The Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions were released\u00a0on November 18th, 2014, and was later released on April 14th, 2015 for the PC. The original edition was announced on October 25th, 2011; the game's first trailer was released on November 2nd, 2011, at 4:00 PM GMT. The game was initially slated for a Spring 2013 release and there were even posters printed saying this but was delayed until September 17th the same year. Then, on July 15th, 2013, Rockstar announced the Japanese release date for the game: October 10th, 2013, almost a month after it was released in the Western world.\u00a0The enhanced edition was announced on June 9th, 2014, with pre-orders made available on June 10. Grand Theft Auto V is set circa 2013 in the city of Los Santos and its surrounding areas and tells the stories of three protagonists: Michael De Santa, Franklin Clinton, and Trevor Philips. It takes place about five years after the events of Grand Theft Auto IV, and four years after the events of Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars. As one of the most awaited video game titles to be released in 2013, the game was widely anticipated prior to its release. Grand Theft Auto V was released to universal acclaim, holding scores of 96 and above on MetaCritic and GameRankings, as well as receiving perfect scores from over 30 reviewers. The game sold 11,210,000 copies and grossed $800,000,000 on its first day of release, setting many records, and eventually making $1,000,000,000 within 3 days of the game's release.Gameplay  Grand Theft Auto V evolves nearly every mechanic that was in the previous Grand Theft Auto games. As far as driving goes, the vehicles have been greatly improved, with Rockstar running more complex physics on them. The cars can even hold to the ground slightly better. The driving mechanics feel more like a racing game, particularly the Midnight Club series, compared to Grand Theft Auto IV's rocky, boat-like handling system. The shooting mechanics are better in terms of the feel of the mechanics and larger compared to the melee mechanics in the game, but that doesn't mean that the melee combat won't be fun, as it has been improved over the previous titles as well. Weapon selection has now also been changed. Instead of the old way of selecting through all the weapons, there is now a Weapon Wheel, which is similar to the one featured in Red Dead Redemption, another game made by Rockstar Games. Grand Theft Auto V draws inspirations from many different Rockstar titles in the past, including Max Payne 3, Midnight Club, Manhunt, and Red Dead Redemption. There are many unique features in the game; one of those features is that when the players are playing as one of three protagonists in the game, the other two are living their independent daily lives, and you will be surprised by what you find the characters doing when you switch back into them. Another unique feature is that the character swapping feature is executed in a Google Earth-styled manner and was displayed during a Game Informer demo, which was shown to have run smoothly and without lag. The PC, PS4 and Xbox One versions present an exclusive feature, the first-person mode, where the whole game can be played through the eyes of the protagonist. This gameplay mode presents a whole new way to play the game. Cars have detailed interiors different from one another, shooting is like that of an FPS game. New activities have been added, such as yoga, triathlons, jet skiing, parachuting, tennis, golf, and scuba diving. Random events have also been added to the game and can appear anytime, while the player is exploring the map. The mobile phone has returned from Grand Theft Auto IV but is now only used for calling the player's contacts, surfing the web, and quick saving. Giving people the middle finger is another new feature the player can use while in a vehicle (which Rockstar recommended you do in various locations around Los Santos to see the outcome of this effect, depending on where the player is at, they will get different reactions from pedestrians). Rockstar has also made changes to the pedestrian mechanics; some pedestrians can be seen at the bus stops in East Los Santos, and the same people can reappear in Rockford Hills working in the gardens of the opulent mansions. Some minor mechanics that help convey the environment and appearance of Los Santos occur at certain times of day, such as a sprinkler system being turned on in the morning in wealthy areas like Morningwood. The map is larger than Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, Grand Theft Auto IV, and Red Dead Redemption combined. After some calculations by members of\u00a0GawdAlmighty.com, that would equal to around 27.5 square miles/71.2 km when land and sea are combined.\u00a0[3]Vehicles  Grand Theft Auto V\u00a0has more vehicles than in any other Grand Theft Auto game to date, with a variety of vehicles, including aeroplanes, helicopters, cars, utility vehicles, emergency service vehicles, motorcycles, and jet skis.\u00a0Players are able to fly planes, which was a cut feature from Grand Theft Auto IV because of the limited size of the map, but the feature is now available in Grand Theft Auto V because of the much larger, open world map. There are also submarines that players are able to use to explore the depths of the Pacific Ocean. The Rhino from previous GTA titles has returned, including a new complex aiming system and a realistic depiction of a tank. A new feature also allows the player to roll-over a vehicle when the car is flipped upside down. Like all previous games, a wide array of vehicles spawn driving around the map that can be stolen. To give the game a sense of realism and make the map feel more alive, various vehicles (as well as pedestrians) spawn in scenarios to make them more interactive with the map, such as delivery vans pulling out of alleyways, emergency vehicles responding, or vehicles pulling in and out of driveways. This behaviour was present in GTA IV to a lesser extent and is revamped in GTA V, even more so with the enhanced release of the game, where modified vehicles can spawn driving around, as well as the presence of the fully-controllable Jet, among other planes flying high above San Andreas.Businesses  Businesses from Grand Theft Auto IV\u00a0re-appear. New businesses also appear, such as the Bugstars pest control company, who specialise in fumigation and the fast-food restaurant, Up-n-Atom Burger. The option to eat takeaway food from outlets such as Burger Shot is no longer available. Instead, the player can only buy drinks from the various Vending Machines across the map.Weapons  The game features a large variety of weapons, like the Norinco Type 56-2 assault rifles with sound suppressors, mounted flashlights, olive drab polymer furniture, and side-folding stocks. There is now the option to mount attachments onto various different guns, each one affecting the performance. Melee weapons like the nightstick\u00a0and the golf club that weren't present in Grand Theft Auto IV have also been introduced to Grand Theft Auto V.Character Customization  In the game, the player has the option to customize the three protagonists' wardrobe and appearance. There is less customisation available compared to that of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (e.g. changing the body mass of the 3 characters isn't available as it was with Carl Johnson in San Andreas). The availability of tattoo parlours, barber shops and the ability to apply and remove facial hair has returned from GTASan Andreas after being missing from previous titles in the HD universe.Multiplayer  Grand Theft Auto V\u00a0expands the multiplayer feature that was present in Grand Theft Auto IV. The multiplayer is treated as an additional title and is known as Grand Theft Auto Online. In GTA Online, multiplayer crews from Max Payne 3 can be carried over to Grand Theft Auto V. Grand Theft Auto V has multiplayer features linked to Rockstar's Social Club.\u00a0 Multiplayer holds up to sixteen people on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, and thirty players in Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and PC versions.Downloadable Content  DLC have been released regularly since the launch of GTA V and GTA Online, adding new vehicles, weapons and other content. They are however more advanced in Online\u00a0with the availability of jobs and properties along with additional character customization options like tattoos, clothing, masks, hairstyles etc.\u00a0 Additional content is unlocked if the player buys the Collector's Edition of GTA V. It features a\u00a0classic hot rod,\u00a0a sports bike,\u00a0an electric sports car,\u00a0a shotgun\u00a0and a hammer. This is available when the Collector's Edition is installed. All subsequent content updates focus on GTA Online, and no content has been implemented in single player GTA V in updates that followed the Ill-Gotten Gains Part 2 update.Synopsis Setting  On November 3rd, 2011, Rockstar Games confirmed that the game would take place in Los Santos and the surrounding countryside - and will not feature a recreated rendition of an entire State of San Andreas - in a statement on their Newswire: Developed by series creator Rockstar North, Grand Theft Auto V heads to the City of Los Santos and the surrounding hills, countryside and beaches in the largest and most ambitious game Rockstar has yet created. During the Game Informer Grand Theft Auto V Cover Story, the vice president of creativity for Rockstar Games, Dan Houser, has stated that Los Santos this time around is different and a lot more developed (having cities, wilderness, deserts, farmlands, towns, a Mount Chiliad, a military base\u00a0and a fully detailed ocean floor (including coral beds). The state of San Andreas is also about five times larger than Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, Grand Theft Auto IV, and Red Dead Redemption.\u00a0After some calculations by members of\u00a0GawdAlmighty.com, that would equal to around 27.5 square miles/71.2 km when land and sea are put together.\u00a0Characters and Premise  Grand Theft Auto V features three playable protagonists: Michael, Trevor and Franklin. Michael is a retired professional bank robber, who after making a sweet deal with the FIB, returned to the life of crime. Trevor is the loose cannon in this story and is also a long time best friend of Michael's and a hothead psychopath as well. Last but certainly not least, we have Franklin, a young and grim repossession agent who has a large amount of experience behind the wheel, but no real experience with a crime until he meets Michael while he was trying to hustle. Other main characters include Amanda, Michael's wife; Jimmy and Tracey, Michael's two grown-up children; Lamar, Franklin's closest friend; Ron, Trevor's paranoid friend;\u00a0and\u00a0Lester,\u00a0a long-time associate of Michael and Trevor.\u00a0Timeframe  Although it is not specifically stated when exactly in 2013 the game takes place, the following evidence suggests August - October 2013:Media Unique Features Hobbies and Pastimes  These are all the hobbies and pastimes listed in the Rockstar Social Club page, note that they are not all mandatory to achieve the 100% completion in the game.Enhanced and PC Versions  Prior to the announcement of the eighth generation consoles and PC versions, there was wide speculation and anticipation regarding an official announcement from Rockstar. On change.org, there was a petition with 728,000+ signatures asking for a PC version at the time of the announcement. Within the comments section of the Rockstar Newswire, and many other GTA\u00a0related blogs, there were many comments asking for a PC/Next Gen release. After its reveal at E3 2014, the news spread like wildfire and became one of the most talked-about announcements. The enhanced version of Grand Theft Auto V was released on November 18, 2014, for the PS4 and Xbox One and was released for PC on April 14, 2015. With the release, there are many\u00a0improvements and changes compared to the versions released on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. No major graphical changes from PS4 and Xbox One are seen in the PC version, other than further Draw Distance and 4K capable quality. The PC version also features 2 exclusive radio stations: The Lab (now available for all consoles from the Ill-Gotten Gains Part 2 update) and Self Radio. The biggest new feature was a first-person view, which is not only available in vehicles but is also for the first time available on foot. Several other features were added. These include (see edition comparison table for more information):Controversy and Criticism  Like all previous GTA games, Grand Theft Auto V has courted controversy, though has been viewed by some as significantly more controversial than its predecessors.Controversy (missions)  A mission which requires the player to torture a target for the government has proven significantly controversial. The mission contains water-boarding, using a wrench on kneecaps and genitals, electrocution and even an action where the player can perform tooth extraction using pliers.Criticism  GTA V received criticism both for the game and its Online counterpart. One part was missions, as only three made the player profit, and only one of them topped $1,000,000. Missions were longer, more taxing and low to non-paying. Only seven non-heist missions gave a payout; Franklin and Lamar gave the player $250, Nervous Ron gave the player $62,000 and Lester's Assassinations gave the player varying amounts of between $3,000 and $10,000. Further criticism included the recent lack of an actual discounted price of the game during the Steam Summer Sale events for the PC version of GTA V, which retained the price at $60, resulting in a major backlash among other customers. The PC version was also criticized for the lack of Valve Anti-Cheat with hackers becoming prevalent in GTA Online and being dealt with very little.Copyrighting and Lawsuits  After the game was released, actress Lindsay Lohan claimed that Rockstar had used her likeness without permission for in-game celeb Lacey Jonas, which Rockstar denied. On 1 September 2016, Lohan's lawsuit was dismissed. In October 2013 Daz Dillinger claimed Rockstar used two songs from Death Row Records without permission, the songs in question being \"C-Walk\" by Kurupt and \"Nothin' But the Cavi Hit\" by Tha Dogg Pound and Mack 10. However, Dillinger was not signed to Death Row at the time and had an ongoing feud with Kurupt. The lawsuit was eventually dropped and the songs stayed in the game.Title Update Notes  To see a list of GTA V's patch notes history, see Grand Theft Auto V/Title Update NotesTrivia Further Reading External Links Grand Theft Auto  Wikipedia Grand Theft Auto (GTA) is a long-running series of video games, published by Rockstar Games and developed by subsidiary companies. The games are primarily developed by Rockstar North (formerly DMA Design). There are currently sixteen games in the series, plus two expansion packs for the original and two expansions for GTA IV and including a multiplayer title. The games have been released for various platforms, including the PC, PSX, PS2, Xbox, PS3, Xbox 360, PS4, Xbox One, GBC, DC, GBA, PSP, DS, iPhone and Android with all but two of the games released on multiple platforms. There has been much controversy involving the series. The unofficial Hot Coffee mod and subsequent uproar gave Rockstar Games a huge amount of press attention. Grand Theft Auto currently holds 10 world gaming records, including the Most Guest Stars in a Video Game Series, Largest Voice Cast in a Video Game (Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas), Largest In-Game Soundtrack (Grand Theft Auto IV), and Most Successful Entertainment Launch Of All Time (Grand Theft Auto V). The Grand Theft Auto series are also ranked 5 in the best-selling video game franchises of all time.Overview  The games allow the player to take on the role of a criminal in a big city, typically an individual who rises through the ranks of organised crime through the course of the game. Various missions are set for completion by the figureheads of the city underworld, generally criminal, which must be completed to progress through the storyline. Assassinations, and other crimes feature regularly, but occasionally taxi driving, firefighting, pimping, street racing, or learning to fly fixed-wing aircraft are also involved as alternate adventures, which can be done at any time during the game, with the exception of the periods performing main missions. The Grand Theft Auto series, belonging to a genre of free-roaming video games called \"sandbox games,\" grants a large amount of freedom to the player in deciding what to do and how to do it through multiple methods of transport and weapons. Unlike most traditional action games, which are structured as a single track series of levels with linear gameplay, in GTA the player can determine the missions they want to undertake, and their relationships with various characters are changed based on these choices. The cities of the games can also be roamed freely at any point in the game, offering many accessible buildings and minor missions. There are exceptions: missions follow a linear, overarching plot, and some city areas must be unlocked over the course of the game. Although you can explore the entire city or state even if it is locked (but there are limited time to explore some city because some may trigger a 4-wanted level or 6-wanted level) and ignore the missions.Setting  See: Grand Theft Auto World and United States of America.Other games 2D Universe  In the 2D Universe there is the original game, the subsequent two expansion packs featuring missions in 1960's London and GTA 2, which featured an improved graphics engine and a different style of gameplay. Whilst originally just called \"Grand Theft Auto\", the first game and era have become known as \"GTA 1\" for clarity.3D Universe  The 3D Universe featured the first blockbuster GTA title, Grand Theft Auto III, and introduced a 3D game world and a third person perspective. The entire era contains interlocking storylines, and many characters appear across multiple games. Notably, games in this era were not released in chronological order, with first game released being the last chronologically, and the last game released being the first chronologically. It is generally believed that the 3D Universe has been completed, and there will be no more official expansions on the characters, storylines or engine. However modifications and fan fiction\u00a0continue to build on these.HD Universe  The HD Universe features Rockstar's new RAGE engine, also used in Rockstar Games Presents Table Tennis. This era featuresThe Fan Base  Grand Theft Auto has one of the largest fan bases of any game franchise. There are many unofficial Fansites about GTA games, providing the latest news, download databases, and often an online forum for the GTA community. Thousands of GTA fansites exist, ranging from small one-person news blogs to community-edited wikis (like this one) to massive downloads databases to forums with hundreds of thousands of members. An activity popular with fans is modding - creating new vehicle models, skins, re-texturing of objects, and tweaking settings in the games' configuration files. These modifications are made freely available on fansites for anyone to download and install into their game. Another popular pastime (since GTA III) is stunting - the act of performing wild stunts with vehicles, which are produced into compilation videos. Another activity popular with members of the community is writing Fan Fiction\u00a0- stories based on events which follow on from, or are based around events which happen in the games, but these are not to be considered canon. The List of GTA Forums attempts to list all of the large communities, and by demonstrating just how big the community as a whole is. These are a list of some of the most popular fan sites:Trivia Official Sites Navigation  sco:Grand Theft Auto (Series)Grand Theft Auto: Vice City  Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Main Theme Grand Theft Auto: Vice City (also referred to as GTA Vice City, Vice City and GTAVC), is the second game in the 3D Universe. GTA Vice City is set in Vice City, Florida, in 1986, and concerns the exploits of protagonist Tommy Vercetti as he rises to become Vice City's major criminal power. The game's events follow on from Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories. Designed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games, it debuted in North America on October 27, 2002 for PlayStation 2 and quickly became the best-selling video game of the year.\u00a0Following this success,\u00a0GTA Vice City\u00a0saw releases in\u00a0Europe,\u00a0Australia\u00a0and Japan, and became available on\u00a0PC\u00a0and\u00a0Xbox.\u00a0Later, Rockstar Vienna packaged the game with its predecessor, GTA III, and sold it as the Grand Theft Auto: Double Pack for Xbox, and finally it debuted for iOS and Android December 6, 2012 as a celebration of its 10-year anniversary.\u00a0As of April\u00a02015,\u00a0GTA Vice City\u00a0is the fourth best-selling PlayStation 2 game of all time in the United States.\u00a0GTA Vice City\u00a0also appeared on the\u00a0Japanese\u00a0magazine Famitsu's readers' list of 100 all-time favorite videogames in 2006. It uses a tweaked version of the Renderware game engine used by GTA III, and similarly presents a huge cityscape, fully populated with buildings (from hotels to skyscrapers), vehicles (cars, motorcycles, boats, helicopters, and planes) and people.Storyline  From the official site: After being released from prison, Forelli Crime Family overlord Sonny Forelli sends Tommy Vercetti to Vice City in order to gain profit off the uprising of the drug trade in the city. After arriving in Vice City, Tommy, Harry and Lee are introduced to Ken Rosenberg who is tasked with driving them to a drug deal with the Vance brothers. But the deal is ambushed and one of the brothers along with Harry and Lee are killed and the money and cocaine are stolen. After Tommy and Rosenberg discuss what they plan to do, Tommy calls Sonny and tells him the deal was a setup. After some hostile words, Sonny agrees to let Tommy handle the situation while Rosenberg tells Tommy about Juan Cortez, a retired colonel who helped set up the deal. After meeting him, his daughter Mercedes Cortez introduces him to the many of the more popular guests including Vice City's largest drug baron Ricardo Diaz at the party before asking him to take her to the The Pole Position Club. Rosenberg then tells Tommy that Kent Paul may know what became of Tommy's merchandise and Paul tells Tommy that Leo Teal may know what happened. Tommy confronts Teal and beats him to death before being confronted by Lance Vance, the third survivor in the botched deal. Tommy and Lance form an alliance and vow to get the money and drugs back. Rosenberg then introduces Tommy to Avery Carrington, a property developer. Avery gives Tommy work and in exchange offers to protect Tommy from any threats to his operation. Tommy is then offered some work from Cortez, who has Tommy kill Gonzalez, a former right-hand who is responsible for botching the deal. Tommy kills Gonzalez and goes for more work. He runs into Lance again and the two watch over a drug deal between Diaz' Gang and the Cubans. But the Haitians ambush the deal as Tommy, Lance and Diaz are forced to fight back and afterwards Tommy is offered work from Diaz. During his work for Diaz, Lance learns that Diaz' gang were the ones who ambushed the deal and killed their associates. Tommy however plans to gain Diaz' trust before attempting to kill him. Lance loses patience and secretly attempts to kill Diaz, but he fails and Tommy is forced to rescue him. With their cover blown, Tommy and Lance head to Diaz' mansion and kill him. With Diaz dead, Tommy is given more opportunities to take over the town. Tommy ends up buying many businesses and expanding on his business. But Lance begins to feel under appreciated, causing a rift between him and Tommy. Meanwhile, Sonny loses patience and personally comes to Vice City to claim his money. Tommy plans ahead and attempts to give him fake money, but Lance betrays Tommy, reveals the plan to rip off Sonny and the Forellis attempt to kill him. Tommy kills Lance and then Sonny and is ultimately wounded in the chaos. Tommy then makes Rosenberg his right-hand man.Setting and Influences  GTA Vice City is arguably the most heavily influenced Grand Theft Auto game, taking inspiration from a wide range of classic 1980s movies, television programmes and music. Perhaps the closest real-life counterpart to GTA Vice City is the television series Miami Vice. Aside from the broad-ranging similarities (80's music \u2014 including new wave, hip-hop, R&B, soul, glam metal and synthesizer pop \u2014 organized crime, drug trafficking, styled cars, pastel clothes etc.), several specific references are included. For example, at a 3-star wanted level or above, the player will be chased by two undercover police officers named Cracker and Butts, who strongly resemble Sonny Crockett and Rico Tubbs, the primary characters from the TV series. Furthermore, these officers drive a VCPD Cheetah, which is itself styled after the 1986 Ferrari Testarossa, Crockett's car in the latter three seasons of the show. Another direct link to Miami Vice is the inclusion of \"Crockett's Theme,\" a piece of instrumental music from the show, on the in-game radio station Emotion 98.3. Many other popular songs that were used in Miami Vice are featured on the game's radio stations, including \"Self Control\" by Laura Branigan, \"Turn Up the Radio\" by Autograph and \"Missing You\" by John Waite. The musical similarities extend to the background score composed specifically for the game \u2014 many cutscenes and the end credits feature ambient, synth-heavy tracks very much in the style of Jan Hammer, who provided the background music for the show, while the \"Theme from Vice City\" is comparable to Hammer's \"Miami Vice Theme\". One of the game's primary characters, Lance Vance, is voiced by Philip Michael Thomas, who portrayed Tubbs in Miami Vice. His initial goal in the game \u2014 to avenge the death of his brother in a drug deal gone wrong \u2014 mirrors Tubbs' objective in the show's pilot episode. Several vehicles and weapons in Vice City are also taken from the TV series, including the Squalo (Sonny Crockett's speedboat), the Stinger (Crockett's Ferrari Daytona, his car for the first two seasons), the Marquis (Crockett's sailing yacht), the Infernus, the Katana (featured during the climax of the episode \"Bushido\"), the Stubby Shotgun (Tubbs' signature weapon in the later seasons of the show) and the MAC-10 (a weapon smuggled in the episode \"Evan\"). Other more subtle references to Miami Vice appear in the game. For example, during the opening credits sequence, one of the stylized images that appears framing the in-game footage is actually a screenshot from the episode \"Bought and Paid For\", showing Nico Arroyo's Lamborghini Countach being chased by Crockett's Daytona. The attire worn by the Cuban and Haitian gangs in the game is taken from two prominent extras in a scene at Miami International Airport in the pilot episode of the show. Also, the game's Hidden Packages, small green \"tiki statues\" packed with cocaine, are a reference to the episode \"Milk Run\", in which cocaine is smuggled in an identical fashion. Another significant influence on GTA Vice City is the 1983 film Scarface, starring Al Pacino as Tony Montana. Several in-game locations, such as the mansion that becomes the Vercetti Estate and the Malibu Club, are obviously styled after locations featured in the movie. Elsewhere in the city, there is a hidden apartment containing a chainsaw within a blood-stained bathroom, a nod to Scarface's infamous chainsaw dismemberment scene. The game's final mission mirrors the end of the movie; in both instances, the main character is assaulted by an army of goons at their mansion leading to a large shootout (although Tommy survives, whereas Montana does not). The \"Mr. Vercetti\" outfit available from the The Pole Position Club strongly resembles an outfit worn by Tony Montana, and even Tommy Vercetti himself takes many character traits from Al Pacino's character, specifically his short temper, his heavy dealings in the cocaine trade and his desire to rise to the top. It is also worth noting that the radio station Flashback FM from Grand Theft Auto III exclusively features songs written for the Scarface soundtrack; the developers acknowledged the film as being a major influence on the overall rise-to-criminal-power theme of that game, and the soundtrack was included as an homage. Other references and influences on Vice City include:Resources Reception  GameSpot rated the game 9.6/10, giving it an Editor's Choice award. Its record was surpassed by its successor Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. Awards GameSpot's Best and Worst of 2002 Best Music on PlayStation 2,[13] Best Action Adventure Game on PlayStation 2,[14] Game of the Year on PlayStation 2[15] IGN's Best of 2002 Best Adventure Game for PlayStation 2 (Editor's Choice and Reader's Choice),[16] Special Achievement for Sound (Reader's Choice),[17] Best Game of the Year for PlayStation 2 (Editor's Choice and Reader's Choice)[18] BAFTA Video Games Awards Best Design, Best PC Game, Best Action Game, Sunday Times Reader Award for Games, Best Playstation 2 Game, Best Sound. Despite near-universal acclaim, GTA Vice City was voted \"Most degrading Video Game to women\" a few months after its release.10th Anniversary Edition  Grand Theft Auto: Vice City 10th Anniversary Edition was announced by Rockstar on October 26th, 2012. On November 21, 2012, Rockstar further revealed it would be launched on December 6, 2012 for iOS and Android devices, and would cost $4.99 for both the App Store version and the Google Play version (with the British release costing \u00a32.99 for the App Store and \u00a33.29 for the Google Play Store). Rockstar announced that it would include \"native high-resolution graphics and several enhancements unique to the iOS and Android platforms including updated character models and lighting effects, new and more precise firing and targeting options, a fully customizable control layout and native support for retina display devices.\"Trivia Further Reading Cheats in GTA IV  In Grand Theft Auto IV, The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony, cheats are activated by bringing up the phone number pad and typing a cheat phone number into Niko Bellic's, Johnny Klebitz's, or Luis Fernando Lopez's mobile phone. After this has been done once, the cheat will be stored in the phone, and accessible from the \"Cheats\" menu there. Note that the PlayStation 3 version of GTA IV needs to be updated in order for trophies to work. Entering some of these cheats in the game will disable certain achievements/trophies only on the active save file; it does not prevent the player from achieving 100% completion. If achievements are blocked, they can be unblocked by loading a save file without blocked achievements. Cheats may have undesired effects on gameplay and can introduce glitches. Note that cheats that are found in the episodes only work in their respective episodes. They do not work across games.GTA IV Vehicles  While outside, bring up the cell phone and insert the following phone numbers to spawn the vehicles listed. (inputting the numbers while inside saves the number if first inputted but does not spawn the vehicle.)Stevie's Car Theft Trick  If the player has completed all 30 of Stevie's Car theft missions, Stevie will pay cash for almost any car delivered to his garage. Using vehicle-spawning cheats, the player can exploit this arrangement for as much money as he or she wants. Below are the prices of the (eligible) spawnable vehicles; keep in mind that this table is presuming that the car is just spawned and has not taken any damage. The FIB Buffalo and the Jetmax are unsellable spawn vehicles and the Annihilator cannot fit in Stevie's garage. Most cars have a low sale value, however driving gently into a wall (enough to scrape the paint) will dramatically improve the value of certain cars. For example, when the Cognoscenti is spawned and sold in perfect condition, Niko will get $8,000; scraping the car against the wall of the garage while entering will change the payout to the full retail value, $10,500 (some have reported the value further increasing to $10,800). Presumably this is a game bug, possibly the game lowering the base value of the cars for reselling, but uses the full price to decide the value when broken in the garage.Trivia The Lost and Damned  The downloadable content adds cheats to spawn new vehicles. These do not block any achievements or trophies. In addition, any of the cheats from the main game can be used, and do not block any achievements in The Lost and Damned. This list of phone numbers can be found at The Lost's clubhouse in Acter, and the website of Lost MC, in the form of a flier listing the vehicles either for sale or as a prize for a contest.The Ballad of Gay Tony  These are the cheats introduced in The Ballad of Gay Tony. Unlike GTA IV's and TLAD's cheats, TBoGT's cheats cannot be found anywhere in-game. The Advanced Weapons Set cheat replaces the one from GTA IV.Trivia See Also Claude  Claude is a character in the Grand Theft Auto series who appears as the protagonist of Grand Theft Auto III, and a minor character in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. He also appears in Grand Theft Auto Online as a parent character model. Claude never speaks in any of his appearances.History Background  Nothing is known about Claude's life before 1992, other than he had emerged as a top contender in an illegal racing ring and owned an abandoned garage in Doherty, San Fierro. Rockstar, however, states that Claude is: \"Definitely a drifter, probably from the west coast, new to Liberty City\" and his \"surname may or may not be Speed\".Events of GTA San Andreas Racing with Carl Johnson  Claude, in 1992, became involved with Catalina, who had recently split up with Carl Johnson, before racing CJ in a losing effort. Following the loss, he hands over his garage to Johnson, before leaving San Andreas with Catalina. The two head to Liberty City where they embark on a nine year crime spree ending with Catalina's betrayal.Events of GTA III Bank Heist and Jailbreak  At the start of the game, Claude and Catalina robbed a bank in Liberty City. Catalina, however, turned on her boyfriend, shooting him and leaving him for dead, justifying her decision with \"I'm an ambitious girl, and you're just small time\". Claude is arrested by the Liberty City Police Department. He is convicted of all charges and is sentenced to ten years in prison. While being transferred to a prison in Portland View, Claude escapes from a police convoy after the Colombian Cartel attack the convoy to free the Oriental Gentleman. Claude and 8-Ball escape to a safehouse in the Red Light District, before moving on to Luigi's Sex Club 7. Luigi Goterelli, the owner, gives Claude his first job in the city, to drive Misty from the hospital back to the club.The Leone Family  Claude, successful in his errand, continues to be employed by Goterelli, who also has him kill a drug dealer and two pimps, before having him drive Misty to Joey Leone's Garage. Claude then begins to work for Joey, killing both Mike Forelli and Lee Chong, before chauffering Toni Cipriani, later working for him against the Triads, principally killing three Triads warlords. Claude, impressing the Leone Family hierarchy, is introduced to the Don, Salvatore Leone. Salvatore, 'seeing nothing but good things' for Claude, has him looking after his 'girl' Maria for the evening, kill Curly Bob (who was selling secrets to the Colombian Cartel, now co-led by Catalina) and later destroy a freighter used as a factory for the drug SPANK. During this time, Claude also works for El Burro, the leader of the Diablos, helping him on various tasks, and Marty Chonks in his attempts to get out of his various problems.The Yakuza  After destroying the Cartel freighter, a paranoid Salvatore attempts to kill Claude by having him enter a bomb-laden car. Salvatore's wife Maria, however, pages Claude and directs him to a small pier where the two meet Asuka Kasen, co-leader of the Yakuza, and flee to Staunton Island after Maria had told her husband that she and Claude were an \"item\". Asuka, unconvinced of Claude's loyalty, has him kill Salvatore Leone to prove himself, before having him kill a number of other people causing her problems. She later introduces him to her brother Kenji and Ray Machowski, a corrupt police man working for the Yakuza. Claude helps Kenji with his problems, including settling debts and freeing a man from prison, and helps Machowski in his attempts to remain unnoticed, eventually helping him flee the city by the airport.Later Jobs and The Exchange  Claude continues to look for work and finds employment with King Courtney, who has him attack the Diablos before attempting to kill him on orders from Catalina, and Donald Love, who has him kill Kenji Kasen disguised as a Colombian Cartel gangster in a Cartel Cruiser to provoke a war. Asuka, unaware of Claude's role in her brother's death, launches an assault on a Cartel-controlled building site and begins to torture Miguel, co-leader of the Cartel, into giving away Cartel secrets. Armed with the information, Asuka sends Claude on various missions to hurt Cartel operations, including stopping the selling of and stealing a shipment of SPANK. Claude briefly finds employment with D-Ice, leader of the Red Jacks sub-sect of the Southside Hoods, and attacks the rival Purple Nines into defeat. Claude returns to the building site and finds that Asuka and Miguel are both dead, whilst a ransom note from Catalina, wanting $500,000 for Maria, is left for him. Claude goes to the Cartel mansion, escapes an ambush, destroys a helicopter piloted by Catalina, thus killing her, and rescues Maria. Maria's fate is then left unknown as the screen fades to black while she is talking, before a gunshot is fired and she stops talking.Personality  Claude is a calm and serious man who appears almost emotionless regardless of the situation, aside from a slight smirk and usually a glare, seemingly taking everything in stride. Provided he is paid for his services, he will take orders from his bosses without reluctance or complaint, usually giving a nod to show that he understands, and doesn't respond even when he is scolded or shouted at by his bosses for doing something wrong. He also prostrates to his bosses if required, in Kenji Kasen's case. Ironically Catalina states that she betrayed Claude for his lack of ambition, and yet throughout the game, Claude works, kills and rises through the ranks of the Liberty City underworld, all just to get his revenge. Because Claude never verbalizes it, it's unclear if he has any true loyalty or respect to anyone. As long as he is paid and it will get him closer to getting revenge, he will work for, and kill, anyone, as evidenced by him killing Kenji Kasen. He even fights on multiple sides of gang wars, working for the Mafia, the Diablos, the Yakuza, and the Yardies, completely without hesitation and goes as far as to orchestrate a gang war between the Yakuza and the Columbian Cartel along with Donald Love. It should be noted that when Claude does kill one of his former bosses, it's usually those who mistreat him or betray him like Kenji or Salvatore Leone, implying Claude doesn't take slights against him lightly, explaining why he is more than willing to kill them. His vindictive side is further evidenced when he coldly leaves Miguel to be tortured by Asuka Kasen, for his part in Catalina's betrayal. He does appear to at least have an amicable relationship with Asuka and Maria, since Asuka is willing to help Claude in his goal for revenge when she learns about Claude's history with Catalina. For the vast majority of the game, Claude is taciturn and\u00a0doesn't speak. He will only make a slight grunt when he is hurt, or an \"Oh!\" whenever he drowns, gets shot, run over, or when he falls down. He may also give passing vehicles the middle finger when crossing the road. There are moments where despite not talking, Claude will let his actions or behaviour speak for him, such as appearing taken aback and flinching slightly when Kenji yells at his face, or visibly reacting in surprise when Maria tells him that she told Salvatore that they slept together, the aforementioned leaving Miguel to his fate, and seemingly attempting to intimidate Carl Johnson when the latter has an argument with Catalina over a racing prize. Claude remains true to his mission of finding and taking revenge on Catalina for leaving him for dead, even showing the slightest bit of pity for Maria when he allows her to live after freeing her and that saving her was at least part of his priorities, only to possibly kill her himself. It's also clear that Claude is primarily out for himself and will use people for his own ends or benefits until he no longer sees a reason to use them anymore; which more often than not ends with Claude killing them.Appearance  Claude is a tall Caucasian male in his late twenties to early thirties. He has a muscular build with brown hair and a faint 5 o'clock shadow. He always wears a black bomber jacket with bronze zippers with a black T-shirt underneath, green cargo pants and blue sneakers. During Give Me Liberty, Claude wears a baggy orange prison jumpsuit with rolled-up sleeves. In the PC version of GTA III, there is an alternate outfit consisting of a brown leather jacket, blue jeans, white sneakers and a brown mustache. Aside from that, Claude is the only 3D-era protagonist (except for Mike) that wears the same clothes throughout the entire game. Claude's appearance in San Andreas is very similar, though he has a more youthful and detailed face. His clothes consist of a re-skinned black biker jacket with a black T-shirt, olive cargo pants and white and black sneakers.Mission Appearances Characters murdered by Claude Optional murders Possible murders Trivia Tommy Vercetti  Thomas \"Tommy\" Vercetti is a character in the Grand Theft Auto series who appears as the protagonist of Grand Theft Auto: Vice City (set in 1986) and mentioned in The Introduction, a prequel of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (set in 1992), and in the game itself during the mission The Meat Business. Tommy is a former member of the Forelli Family, and the leader of the Vercetti crime family in Vice City.Biography Early Life  Thomas Vercetti was born in Liberty City in 1951. His father worked in a printing shop and as a child, Tommy used to clean the rollers with him. Tommy had planned to follow in his father's footsteps, but, in his own words, \"led a different life\". Dialogue spoken by Tommy while fighting indicates that he had a bad relationship with his mother.Early 1970s  Sometime prior to 1971, Tommy joined the Forelli Family. He continued to work with the Forelli Family, making his way up the ranks and presumably becoming a made man. In 1971, Sonny Forelli, growing apprehensive of Tommy's increasing power, attempted to set up an ambush for him, under the guise of a hit in Harwood. However, Tommy not only survived, but also killed all eleven men that were sent to kill him. He was arrested and convicted of eleven counts of murder. Tommy was sentenced to death for the murders, but since he kept quiet and turned no evidence on the Forelli Family, Sonny Forelli used judicial connections to commute the sentence. Tommy remained in prison for fifteen years, refusing to divulge any Forelli Family secrets to the LCPD. He was nicknamed \"the Harwood Butcher\" by the press.Events of Grand Theft Auto Vice City - 1986  In 1986, Tommy was released from prison after Sonny \"pulled some strings\". Fearing that Tommy is \"too well known\" in Liberty City, and also wanting to expand into the drugs trade in the south, Sonny sends Tommy to Vice City. Tommy flies to Vice City along with Harry and Lee, meeting Ken Rosenberg at the airport, before immediately driving to a drug deal at the docks. The drug deal turns into an ambush, and Harry, Lee, and one of the drug dealers are killed. Only Tommy, Ken, and the other dealer escape the attack. Tommy informs Sonny of the ambush and is reminded that Sonny is \"not a man to be screwed with\"; Sonny makes it clear he wants his money and his drugs back. Tommy initially works for Ken, starting riots and intimidating jurors. While working for Ken, Tommy also meets Lance Vance, the other dealer, who seeks revenge for his brother who was killed during the initial drug deal. Tommy also works for Juan Cortez, an intermediary for the drug deal, who begins to look into the ambush for Tommy. Meanwhile, Cortez has Tommy steal missile technology chips and kill Gonzalez, who had talked about the deal. Cortez, believing that Ricardo Diaz was responsible for the ambush, asks Tommy to act as protection for Diaz in a deal with the Cubans. The Haitians, enemies of the Cubans, ambush the deal but are killed by Tommy and Lance. Diaz, seeing potential in Tommy and Lance, hires them to kill gang members who were stealing his money and steal the fastest boat in the city in order to purchase drugs from a dealer on a boat. Lance eventually attempts to kill Diaz for the death of his brother, but is captured by Diaz's men, though he is later freed by Tommy. The two subsequently go on to take revenge, killing Diaz in his own mansion. The death of Ricardo Diaz brings change to Vice City, allowing Tommy and Lance to step in and continue the crime ring established by Diaz. Tommy, however, begins to look beyond the protection rackets established by Diaz and purchases a number of businesses around the city, most prominently the Malibu Club, the Cherry Popper Ice Cream Factory (a front for a drug running business), InterGlobal Films and the Print Works. After purchasing each business, Tommy helps establish their influence in the city. During this time, Tommy also begins to work for a number of smaller time criminals in the city, including the Cuban leader Umberto Robina and the Haitian leader Auntie Poulet (due to her drugging him), helping both sides attack the other. He also works for Avery Carrington's real estate business, Phil Cassidy's gun running business, Mr. Black's hitman business, Mitch Baker's biker gang, and Kent Paul's management of Love Fist. Tommy also went on to help Juan Cortez escape the city when the GIGN assault his yacht for the missile technology. Sonny Forelli, growing restless and impatient, sends some of his men to collect some of his money from Tommy's businesses. Tommy kills the collectors, although not in time to save Earnest Kelly, the owner of the Print Works, from being injured. Tommy decides to give Sonny fake money printed at the Print Works. Tommy meets Sonny in person at his estate to give him the counterfeit cash, but Sonny informs him that Lance has sided with him, betraying Tommy. A gun battle ensues, with Tommy killing both Lance and Sonny, who also confirms Tommy's suspicion that he was set up in Harwood. Following the deaths of Lance and Sonny, Tommy and Ken taken over, becoming the most powerful men in Vice City.Life After 1986  Tommy Vercetti continued to run the criminal underworld of Vice City after 1986; during that time, Tommy's relationship with Ken became increasingly strained due to Ken's cocaine addiction. Tommy eventually got Ken into rehab at the Fort Carson Medical Center in Fort Carson, San Andreas. Although Ken completed rehab and got clean of his addiction, Tommy refused to speak to him following this and essentially cut all ties.\u00a0 Tommy is mentioned by Ken in the mission The Meat Business in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, leading Carl Johnson to question, \"Who the fuck is Tommy?\" Rosenberg also calls Vercetti at the introduction video of the aforementioned game, Tommy's secretary answers and tells Ken that Tommy is not taking calls, this is the moment where Rosenberg discovers that Vercetti was ignoring him. Tommy is also mentioned in Kent Paul's website under the list of social problems, saying, \"(see, Tom, I didn't mention your name, nowhere. Maybe you won't get us killed now, okay?)\" This could mean that Tommy is still alive and in power during the early 2000s.Personality  Tommy Vercetti is depicted as both intelligent and temperamental. He is easily angered and quick to resort to violence. He does not hesitate to kill, though many of his victims are trying to kill Tommy, or have done something that guaranteed their deaths. However, Tommy often shows care and sensitivity towards characters like Mercedes Cortez and especially Earnest Kelly, viewing Kelly as a father figure due to his own father working in a print works, and showing anger and concern when Kelly is injured by Sonny's hitmen. Tommy prefers to perform his own work rather than delegate tasks to others. Even after he has his own gang and other subordinates working for him, he usually puts his plans in motion personally. He also personally gets involved if things aren't going as well as he'd like - for example, in the opening cutscene of Bar Brawl he is irritated by Lance's lazy attitude towards the bar refusing to pay protection money and immediately goes out to settle things himself. Despite his hot temper, Tommy tends to be loyal and trusting, especially toward those whom he feels helped him to achieve his goals. He went back to work for Sonny Forelli after being released from prison even though he strongly suspected that Sonny set him up. This is especially true of Lance Vance. Although Lance's competence was declining and his temperament was becoming negative, Tommy still viewed and attempted to treat Lance as an equal partner, even letting him in on the counterfeiting setup at the Vice City Print Works. Tommy was shocked at Lance's betrayal, leading Earnest Kelly to quip, \"Tommy, for a raging lunatic, you sure are na\u00efve\".Appearance  Tommy, an Italian-American, is portrayed with a tall, swarthy, handsome appearance, combed dark brown, almost black hair, brown eyes, and a constant five o'clock shadow. He first appears wearing a light blue-green Hawaiian shirt with dark blue palm trees printed on it, a gold pearl necklace around his neck, a gold watch around his left wrist, and a pair of blue jeans and white sneakers. He has other outfits also, and his appearance can be completely changed through the Player Skin Setup, a new feature of Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, allowing players to create custom textures for the default player model and apply them in the game.Inspiration  Tommy Vercetti shows many characteristics in common with Tony Montana, a drug lord from the film Scarface. The two both end up in exile, both arrive in the city wearing Hawaiian shirts, both rise to power in Miami using great amounts of violence, both build an empire from a large estate and mansion, both have short tempers and are prone to violence, both work as contract killers, and both killed their collaborators and took their ex-bosses' empires. The interior of the Vercetti Estate is even modeled after Montana's mansion, save for the lack of an indoor pool. There are, however, key differences, most notably that Tommy did not become addicted to his own narcotics and that Tommy survived the shootout in his mansion, as opposed to Montana who was killed, and Tony Montana is of Cuban descent, whereas Tommy Vercetti is of Italian descent. Tommy Vercetti also bears some resemblance to 'Mr. Blonde' from the film Reservoir Dogs, played by Michael Madsen who also voiced Toni Cipriani in Grand Theft Auto III, protagonist of Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories. The film sees 'Mr. Blonde' released from prison after loyally doing time for his crime family, as Tommy did after the \"Harwood Incident\". Tommy later performs contract killings for a 'Mr. Black', whilst he is referred to as 'Mr. Teal' (a reference to the then deceased Leo Teal). He also has a small resemblance to his own voice actor Ray Liotta. Tommy Vercetti's story is extremely similar to famous real life mobster Joseph Iannuzzi. In the 1980's Joseph was sent to Florida to be a representative for his mob boss Tommy Argo. Like the relationship between Tommy and Sonny in game, the relationship between Joseph Iannuzzi and Tommy Argo became strained over a large sum of money. When Joseph was forced to flee Florida with a large sum of Argo's money. As a result, Argo ambushed Joseph in Florida and nearly killed himMurders Committed by Tommy Vercetti  Optional MurdersMission Appearances  GTA Vice CityDialogue  This is Tommy's dialogue during free roam. [1]Trivia Liberty City (HD Universe)  Wikipedia The City of Liberty, commonly known as Liberty City, is a major city located in the State of Liberty in Grand Theft Auto IV.Description  GTA IV marks Liberty City's fourth appearance in the series after the original Grand Theft Auto, Grand Theft Auto III and Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories, which came out in 1997, 2001 and 2005 respectively. The new rendition of the city is, more likely, the \"official\" GTA universe's version of New York City. The city has more detail and personality, with many places which are based on landmarks such as the Statue of Happiness, Star Junction, and the Rotterdam Tower. This rendition of Liberty City has versions of four of the five boroughs of New York City, plus New Jersey. Brooklyn is Broker, Queens is Dukes, Manhattan is Algonquin, and Bronx is Bohan. The state and city of New Jersey is Alderney, which technically is separate from Liberty City. The only borough not to be recreated in the game is Staten Island. Although in the game, Liberty City appears to be an isolated set of islands, the rest of America is actually nearby. Rockstar Games stated that they avoided placing unreachable pieces of land in the distance to retain the city's \"complete\" feel. Grand Theft Auto IV and its two episodes (The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony) use the same full rendition of the city. However, a small number of different locations are accessible in the different episodes. Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars uses the entire city apart from Alderney, and is altered for the top-down perspective of the game. In Grand Theft Auto V, the films Meltdown and An American Divorce produced by Richards Majestic Productions are set in Liberty City.Geography  Liberty City is divided into 56 individual and unique neighbourhoods which are spread across four boroughs within Liberty City and border the neighboring state of Alderney, including Alderney City. Whereas the 3D Universe version of Liberty City was partly located on the mainland, the GTA IV version is completely made up of islands.History of Liberty City  Liberty City first began when the Dutch sent out English explorer Horatio Humboldt to find a new location for them to sell Marijuana in 1609, and\u00a0he sailed to the Humboldt river. The Dutch established a colony and soon plenty other European nationalities travelled to the city to find what freedom was truly like in the colony of New Rotterdam, which promised convenience stores and public hangings, as well as a slave trade craze that swept the colony ever since the very first shipload of slaves. Eventually, the English set sail for the colony, which was based on the slender island named Algonquin after an old Indian word with the same pronunciation and the settlers signed a petition to be ruled by the British.\u00a0 Soon the English expanded the colonies by eradicating natives and took over three new islands for the colony. The first consisted of both Broker, named after the king's bastard son who was conceived by a milk maid and the other Dukes, after the term Duky because the people smelled like excrement. Alderney was named after a man called Phillip D'Alderney, the only man who could bear living in the swampy industrial island. The smallest island was named Bohan for the Dutch word.\u00a0The British and the Americans fought in what was to be known as the American Revolution for freedom from taxes, and after receiving a statue of a transvestite eating ice cream from the French, the Americans won and removed the Union Jack and melting the statue of King George into chains, toilet seats and gold teeth. Slavery was soon outlawed in Liberty City and women were forced to spend time under train tracks servicing men. The politicians of Liberty City moved to Washington DC when Liberty City's status as the capital of the nation was removed and given to DC. Frederick O' Fitzpatrick decided to head to the south and teach them a lesson after tensions risen and a civil war was on the horizon, but before doing so constructed Middle Park. Beyond the tranquility, people were tired of living in black and white and riots ensued, which didn't help with a civil war looming. (From History of Liberty City TV show GTA IV). It is stated in two internet news articles in GTA V (right after the missions Franklin and Lamar and Three's Company) that Liberty City was devastated by a massive storm. This is an obvious reference to Hurricane Sandy which hit New York and New Jersey in 2012.City Information  As of 2008, the population of Liberty City is 8,363,710. The mayor is Julio Ochoa while the Deputy Mayor is Bryce Dawkins. Thomas Stubbs III is Liberty City's congressman. The time setting is approximately late summer-early fall 2008. The area of the city is compressed in size (as seen with the Empire State Building's proximity to the Broker Bridge in the final shot), and the various landmarks are placed much closer to each other than in real life. The entire map is smaller than that of GTA San Andreas, but is immensely more detailed. This made Liberty City in GTA IV the most lifelike city to feature in any Grand Theft Auto game at the time of release. From the massive buildings and large mass of traffic on every block of Algonquin, to residential areas of Bohan, Rockstar has successfully compromised quantity for quality, although the lack of pedestrians in normally crowded places such as Star Junction (based on Times Square) has drawn criticism. In GTA IV, the scaling of Liberty City as compared to New York City has a number of differences in the building heights, road distances, and landmark positions. Liberty City is also known as a shrunk version of New York City with almost everything cramped together. Ground Zero (World Trade Center site) has been excluded from the GTA IV's Liberty City in a way that as though it does not even exist in the real life New York City while having the site replaced with the merger of buildings surrounding the Ground Zero. Liberty City is an incredibly diverse city and so are its neighbourhoods and residents. Such examples of diverse neighbourhoods include the large Russian, Italian-American and African-American populations found in various neighborhoods across the city. Liberty City's residents are known for their sarcastic attitude. The demonym of a Liberty City inhabitant is \"Libertonian\".Housing, Architecture and Geography  Liberty City has a unique geography. Firstly, it is an island city that is surrounded by water. Consisting of four different boroughs (Broker, Dukes, Bohan and Algonquin) that are all separated by water and connected by bridge; with the exception of Broker and Dukes, which are connected by land. Smaller islands also exist around the main boroughs; including Happiness Island, Colony Island and Charge Island. Liberty City's housing architecture and style is a direct amalgam off of the style used in New York City. Brownstone rowhouses, terraced townhouses, low-rise apartments and urban tenements are commonplace; especially in the boroughs of Broker and Dukes. Some of the more affluent neighborhoods; particularly in Dukes, have a higher concentration of larger single-family homes of Tudor Revival, Irish or Victorian style. The borough of Algonquin hosts many modern landmarks and skyscrapers, in fact, Liberty City boasts some of the tallest Skyscrapers in the United States, with the most impressive being the Rotterdam Tower. Various points of natural parkland can also be found throughout Liberty City, the largest of which being Middle Park in Algonquin. Due to the size and population demand of Liberty City, housing projects, towers and urban complexes are also commonplace throughout the various boroughs. They are, however, often stereotyped as being low-income while breeding high-crime rates, despite some housing projects in Liberty City being more affluent and having a lower crime-rate. Housing projects in Liberty City include: Parks of Liberty City include:Crime  It's no secret that various areas in Liberty City suffer from high crime rates; most likely brought about by the large number of gangs and criminal organizations\u00a0in Liberty as well as a large underground black market in various areas - in particular the drugs trade, each fighting for control of the city and will use any means possible. The Commission is an Italian-American Mafia association made up of the Five Families, which are the Ancelotti Family, the Pavano Family, Gambetti Family, the Messina Family and the Lupisella Family. Another mafia family called the Pegorino Family also exist but are not part of the Commission and primarily operate in the state of Alderney as opposed to Liberty City. Aside from the Italian mafia families, there are other major crime organizations such as the\u00a0McReary Crime Family/Irish Mob, Russian Mafia, Korean Mob and the Triads. Aside from these major big-time\u00a0criminal organisations, there are, of course, many\u00a0small-time local\u00a0ethnic street gangs in Liberty City as well, such as the Albanian Mob, Jamaican Hillside Posse, motorcycle gangs (The Lost and the Angels of Death) and\u00a0various pockets of African American gangs (such as\u00a0the North Holland Hustlers) as well as various Hispanic gangs such as\u00a0the Northwood Dominican Drug Dealers and the Spanish Lords. Many of the gangs fight over the drugs trade and other businesses in Liberty City for money and power. However, after word gets out about smuggled diamonds; some of the major criminal organizations battle for possession of the diamonds too; including the Pegorino Crime Family\u00a0and The Lost Motorcycle Club. Aside from the gang violence and drug trafficking, other crimes and social problems such as prostitution, car theft, arms trafficking, economic deprivation/poverty and a little history of corruption in the LCPD\u00a0also plague certain districts and neighborhoods. During 2008, Liberty City mayor Julio Ochoa took a tough stance against gun crime by introducing gun control laws; limiting the availability of firearms. He did so primarily by shutting down Ammu-Nation\u00a0stores across Liberty City. However, this campaign has proved to be generally ineffective as the sale of firearms in Liberty City appears to be booming as an underground black market; with criminal organisations, drug lords and gangs typically being heavily armed.\u00a0 Statistically, parts of\u00a0Broker and especially Bohan are notorious for their higher crime rates, gang violence and drug trafficking market in the city. Most of the crime occurs in the deprived and run-down neighbourhoods as well as the large projects/housing complexes around Liberty City. Bohan deserves a special mention as they often\u00a0outperform the other boroughs in terms of crime rate with Broker often coming in second. The many projects and housing complexes around northern Algonquin also appear to be plagued by a high crime rate. Dukes appears to be the safest borough in Liberty City due to its heavy middle/upper-class influence but still contains a minority of areas with a higher crime rate. Crime-for-crime, some of the most dangerous and/or deprived\u00a0areas with the highest crime rate in Liberty City include:Food & Drink  Much of Liberty City's catering scene comprises fast-food chains and snack vendors. Two of the most dominant fast-food chains within the city are the Burger Shot and Cluckin' Bell franchises. Their restaurants can be found in several locations across the city. Hot Dog vendors can also be found in many locations, as well as a few hamburger vendors and mixed nuts vendors around Liberty City, particularly around Middle Park.Sports Teams  Liberty City, being one of the largest cities in GTA's America, is home to many major league sports franchises. The Liberty Swingers (based on the New York Yankees, New York Mets and Brooklyn Dodgers) are the baseball team. There is one American football team, the Liberty City Wrath (based on the New York Giants and the New York Jets). There are\u00a0two basketball teams, the Liberty City Penetrators (based on the New York Knicks), and the Liberty City Warriors\u00a0(who share a name with the Golden State Warriors), as well as a women's basketball team, the Liberty City Salamanders. The hockey team is\u00a0the Liberty City Rampage (who have a logo that's similar to an older Washington Capitals logo, albeit recolored). There are also three soccer teams the\u00a0Red Mist FC (based on the New York Red Bulls) , the\u00a0Liberty City Cocks\u00a0and the\u00a0Liberty City Beavers.Transportation  The main form of transport throughout Liberty City is by road, there's a fleet of taxis throughout the city, making it easier to transport through the city fast. There is a prominent freeway in each borough, with two in Algonquin and another stretching from Broker to Dukes. A bridge connects each island to Algonquin, with two from Algonquin to Broker and another from Dukes to Bohan. There is also an extensive subway system, connecting the many areas of Broker, Dukes, Algonquin, and Bohan with two main routes. One serves inner Algonquin and Bohan, the other serves outer Algonquin and Broker/Dukes. The subway] in reaches everywhere in Liberty City except for Alderney, as it is not a part of Liberty State. Every street in the new Liberty City has a name, increasing the realism (in past games, only a few rare street names were used for locations such as Grove Street in GTA: San Andreas. The 3D Universe version of Liberty City had some street names as evidenced on the GTA III website, but none are directly referenced in any game). All the streets on each island have a meaning, for example, most streets in Broker are named after famous cowboys; streets in Dukes are named after patriotic events, and streets in Algonquin are named after minerals, chemical elements, and U.S. State Capitals. Helicopters can be flown either by the player or by an NPC pilot when participating in Helitours or by using Brucie's special ability. Liberty City has an airport in Dukes named\u00a0Francis International\u00a0that receives planes from around the world.\u00a0The aircraft cannot be used by the player in the game. Boats can also be used to travel between the islands.Freeways Bridges Tunnels Education High Schools  A few high schools that are based in Liberty City can be seen on the in-game website Hornyhighschoolreunions.comVespucci University  Vespucci University is located in Varsity Heights, Algonquin and appears to be based on Columbia University.Public Services Police Stations Fire Stations Hospitals Choice of City  When asked why Rockstar Games decided to re-use Liberty City, Dan Houser, Vice President of the company said: \"New York City is an environment we felt had never been done to the level we were envisioning it in a video game. From looking at all of the locations, this was the one that really stood out to us, and really had that impact. It has.\" \"The texture of the Algonquin streets, which are filled with crater-like potholes and occasional glimpses of the brick used in a world gone by, are greatly varied in design and something you can't tear your eye from. The visual makeup of the city was something we could capture real well and really understand the minute aspects of its personality. Trying to put that into a videogame is something that we think is unique to the video game medium. It was a way that we could capture some aspects of the experience of living there that you couldn't put into a film, you couldn't put into a TV show, and you couldn't put into a book.\" \"A big part of New York life is walking around the streets and meeting lunatics. That's something that we definitely tried to put into the game. We are trying to give it that life and difference between the neighborhoods and the difference between the kinds of people. We are trying to capture that Capital of the World aspect of New York.\" \"It's not the full city, it's an approximation thereof. We make a city that feels like the real thing, but is perfectly tuned for gameplay in the broadest sense. The world is not designed to be a video game. We are trying to make a video game that feels like the world, but still plays like a video game. The design of the city and the missions that unfold within it are designed hand-in-hand and complement each other perfectly. Everything in this world is here for a reason, where it is directly tied to gameplay or simply there to create atmosphere.\"Beta Releases  The depiction of Liberty City in the official website of GTA IV has been retouched to picture the entire city, or at least its landmass, as being larger than it is in-game. Broker is seen extended further to the right, or east, and lights that stretch to the horizon are visible in this extended area, as well as behind Dukes and Algonquin. The same modification can be seen to a more limited extent to the left or west of Alderney. Liberty City in GTA IV was originally going to be called Liberty State and it would feature other landmasses such as mountains and countryside around the currently featured islands, but time limitations caused Rockstar to instead resort to just focusing on the city. Alderney is supposed to symbolise New Jersey. Like New Jersey, Alderney is a full state, although many mistake it to be a part of Liberty State as\u00a0Alderney is included in most maps of Liberty City. Although, the Autoeroticar website states in that it is located in \"Alderney City, Liberty City.\" Whether or not it is just a typographical error or it is intentional is unknown.GTA Chinatown Wars  Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars has a few differences to the Liberty City in the main console versions. This is mainly due to its top-down view, which is as a result of its design for the Nintendo DS portable platform.Trivia See Also Secrets and Easter Eggs in GTA IV Secrets Easter Eggs  The Statue of Happiness' face bears a striking resemblance to former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. This resemblance, along with the cup of coffee in her right hand, may be a reference to the Hot Coffee controversy which Clinton took investigation in, also suggesting that new regulations be put on video games. The southern door has a sign: \"No Hidden Content This Way\". This is similar to the sign on top of the Gant Bridge in GTA San Andreas and The Hidden Sign in GTA III.Easter eggs references to previous games Elements re-used from previous games Easter eggs references to other games Easter eggs references to media culture Easter eggs real-world references Easter eggs about in-game street names Easter eggs about adult humor Easter eggs about languages Bugs & Glitches Banshee  The Banshee is a recurring mid-sized sports car appearing in every GTA game since Grand Theft Auto III and shares its reputation with the Infernus for being one of the two longest running sports cars in the GTA series. It is manufactured by Bravado in the HD Universe.Design 3D Universe  In Grand Theft Auto III, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories, the Banshee resembles a first generation Dodge Viper RT/10, with its dual exhaust and curvilinear design. It differs from its real life counterpart in its narrower width and headlight design. The Banshee also borrows minor elements from other 90s American coupes, such as the hood scoops from the 1993-1997 Pontiac Firebird and headlights resembling those of a 1994-1996 Dodge Stealth. The car's rear end is mostly based on the first generation Dodge Viper RT/10, but features wrap-around taillights, a distinct design element shared with the 1993-2002 Chevrolet Camaro. The Banshee also features very pronounced fender flares, something not found on any Viper and very uncommon on American cars of its era. This rendition of the Banshee is the only top-down convertible that the player cannot jump into without opening the driver door. The Grand Theft Auto Advance rendition, which mimics the design of GTA III's Banshee, is also comparable to the GTA 2's Rumbler, but is generally sleeker, sports the same single stripe as other Banshees, and comes with a vinyl top. In Grand Theft Auto: Vice City and Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories, the Banshee resembles a mid 80's model Corvette C4, with its angular design and dual twin-exhaust. The Banshee is one of a handful of vehicles where CJ kicks the driver instead of punching them or slamming their head into the steering wheel. This is probably due to the fact that the Banshee sits quite low to the ground.Grand Theft Auto IV  In Grand Theft Auto IV, the Bravado Banshee resembles a second generation Dodge Viper SR (though the Banshee has a V8 instead of a V10 engine), but has a side-pipe exhaust and a shorter roofline, resembling the third generation or fourth generation Dodge Viper ZB. The front fascia loosely resembles the Marcos Mantis, while the taillights resemble those of the Aston Martin DB9\u00a0 and the front end resembles a\u00a0Third Generation Mazda RX-7.\u00a0The interior of the car appears to be inspired by the MKIV Toyota Supra's, with the auxiliary dashboard controls facing the driver. In GTA IV, despite its obvious sporty appearance, the game does not classify the Banshee as a sports car. Many characters show disdain for the car, and many of Niko's girlfriends do not like it. In Grand Theft Auto IV, the Banshee may spawn with several cosmetic accessories: Hardtop Banshees do not have windows, so they are easier to steal than other cars. This is counteracted by an alarm that will go off when the door is opened. In the CNT TV show, I'm Rich\u00a0and in the billboard for Heavy Weapons X, the beta version of the Banshee with two stripes instead of one can be seen.Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars  In the DS version of Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars, the Banshee appears similar to either the Phoenix or the GTA Vice City rendition, while in the PSP/iOS version it resembles the GTA IV rendition, but always features two white stripes.Grand Theft Auto V  The Banshee returns to Grand Theft Auto V, holding the same design as its previous appearance in GTA IV. In the enhanced version of GTA V, the Banshee is given a restored interior model that greatly resembles that of the Dodge Viper's, right down to the vertically-aligned speedometers.Performance 3D Universe  Being a sports coupe laid out in an FR layout connected to a 5-speed transmission, the Banshee in the GTA III era is one of the fastest sports cars, but requires a tactile driving style to perform well. Fishtailing and spin outs are common if moderation is not used with the throttle. Examination of the game's engine reveals the vehicle's performance stats remain unchanged throughout, with a top speed of 124 mph (200 km/h), a weight of 3,086 lbs (1,400 kg) and all-wheel disc brakes. The Banshee's speed in GTA Advance is significantly high, nearly matching that of the Police Car. The Banshee in San Andreas features a different engine sound from the other games. Acceleration is one of the best in San Andreas. Steering response is very sharp. Turning at high speeds may cause the car fishtail, so braking is appropriate considering the high power of the Banshee. Improper braking can also cause the car to slide, so the player will need to brake smoothly. It appears to be powered by a carbureted V6.Grand Theft Auto IV  The Banshee in Grand Theft Auto IV is very fast, thanks to its 300ci (4.9L), twin-turbocharged V8 mated to a 5-speed gearbox with an FR configuration. The acceleration and top speed are similar to that of most exotic sports cars in the game, such as the Super GT, Turismo, and Comet. It is stated to have a top speed of 99 mph in the files. The car has sharp handling with the expense of stability. The high-powered engine coupled to the rear wheel drive causes the rear wheels to lose traction easily. Fortunately, power distribution is smooth, making it easier to control. It requires extra caution to maintain the traction when cornering at high speed, otherwise the rear wheels will slide. Many, however, find this handling characteristic preferable. Those who are able to control the car's high power output will be able to play with this weakness. The Banshee is an excellent racing vehicle, given that the player can properly control the squirrely handling. The suspension is firm and set low, often leaving the Banshee's ground effects victim to curbs and other low-laying objects. Braking is very good; the Banshee out-brakes every other vehicle in the game, and ABS is standard on all models. Crash deformation is moderate; it copes reasonably well with head-on crashes, however after a while the engine will begin to fail.\u00a0 As a result of the outstanding performance, this can easily compete with the fastest cars in the game. However, for some reason, the Banshee is not considered to be a supercar in online race classes or by characters (e.g. it is not approved by Alex Chilton, who is fond of supercars/expensive cars). Like the Infernus, Buffalo, F620, Sultan RS and Bullet GT, the Banshee occasionally backfires from its exhaust pipes when shifting gears, or when kicking in the accelerator quickly from a complete stop.Grand Theft Auto V  The Banshee returns to Grand Theft Auto V, now sporting better acceleration, and a significantly higher top speed. Sharing the same braking distance in GTA IV, it is only slightly different performance-wise from GTA IV. The handling line has slightly improved, due to GTA V's new vehicle handling. Overall, the car is a good pick for an escape car, but not so good for off-roading, or for fast cornering, due to its back-heavy weight distribution, and its terrible grip. Although the Banshee in GTA V is identical visually to the one in GTA IV, the engine now produces a more sportier sound, similar to the real-life SRT Viper. Its engine size is now updated to a massive 8.4 liter carbureted V8 engine as reported on Legendary Motorsport (GTA Online), though it remains a V8 and not a V10 like the Viper. However, it is severely underpowered, even with twin turbochargers. What causes many players to turn away from the legendary sports car is the low top speed, only 140 mph, according to the website. This may actually be incorrect, as the Banshee is capable of catching up to supercars like the Infernus and even the Zentorno without any modification.Modifications Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas  Note: The TransFender in Las Venturas charges 20% more (except for colors).Grand Theft Auto V Variants \"The Bitch\"  In GTA IV, Brucie Kibbutz owns a unique\u00a0black Banshee with a yellow stripe, which he dubs \"The Bitch\". He intended to use this car in the street race in the mission No. 1, but the car failed to start (likely due to the fact that Brucie personally tuned the car). Having an alternative in mind, Brucie called his friend Stevie for a replacement car; Stevie's bright yellow Comet. A normal Banshee in yellow with a black stripe can be found on the streets. The player can see Brucie's black and yellow Banshee on Auto-Eroticar's website.Special Variants Grand Theft Auto III Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Grand Theft Auto IV Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars Prominent Appearances in Missions Grand Theft Auto III Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Grand Theft Auto Advance Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories Grand Theft Auto IV The Ballad of Gay Tony Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars Grand Theft Auto V Notable Owners Grand Theft Auto III Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Grand Theft Auto Advance Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Grand Theft Auto IV Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars Real-Life Counterpart  A one-of-a-kind real life reproduction of the Banshee\u00a0has been\u00a0made by West Coast Customs, by modifying a 2006 Dodge Viper SRT-10. It was given away by Rockstar Games\u00a0in a GameStop PowerUp Rewards Epic Rewards Giveaway contest. It began on September 1, 2013, sixteen days before the release of Grand Theft Auto V. On September 30, 2013, the contest ended and the winner was 56-year-old Cheri Parker from North Carolina. She later sold the car on eBay to pay for her sons' college fees. The only thing that has changed from the original Dodge Viper is how the car looks; it is still essentially a stock Viper, which means it would have a V10 instead of a V8.

The game is the first of the 3D Universe, and introduced many new features and increased the fan base of the series. It was originally released on the PlayStation 2, PC, and Xbox. GTA III is the first foray into true three-dimensional GTA gameplay, with the player taking control of the game via a third-person perspective, viewed from behind and above the player character, as opposed to the Top-Down Perspective in the earlier Grand Theft Auto 1 and Grand Theft Auto 2 games. The transition from top-down to full 3D has been widely regarded as a great maneuver, proven by its phenomenal sales figures. The changes made for GTA III marked a defining point in the series' graphical representation and control scheme. More recent GTA titles have stuck with the same 3D control and visual scheme, and all other titles of GTA are likely to remain so, albeit improved in visual quality as hardware improves. The game was met with an outstanding universal critical acclaim, becoming one of the highest rated video games in history.Storyline  From the official site LIBERTY CITY, USA. The Worst Place in America. You've been betrayed and left for dead. Now you're taking revenge, unless the city gets you first. Mob bosses need a favor, crooked cops need help and street gangs want you dead. You'll have to rob, steal and kill just to stay out of serious trouble. Anything can happen out here. Following the events of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, Catalina leaves with her boyfriend Claude to Liberty City. At the start of the game, the two are seen robbing a bank with Miguel, a Colombian Cartel member and their getaway driver, and another unnamed man. Amidst the chase, Catalina tells Claude that she is an ambitious girl and doesn't need him anymore, shooting him, killing the unnamed man, and leaving with Miguel and the money. Claude survives, and is arrested for the robbery. While crossing the Portland Island bridge in a police convoy, the\u00a0Colombian Cartel\u00a0ambushes them by blowing up the Callahan Bridge\u00a0(isolating Portland\u00a0from the rest of the cities)\u00a0and then kidnap an\u00a0Old Oriental Gentleman. Claude and another prisoner named\u00a08-Ball\u00a0free themselves while the convoy is ambushed and leave. 8-Ball introduces Claude to Luigi Goterelli and Claude works for him to prove himself useful. Luigi orders him to drive Joey Leone's favorite prostitute, Misty, to Joey's Garage, and earns Joey's trust by performing missions against the Triads and the Forelli Family. Joey introduces him to Toni Cipriani, who Claude begins working for to exact revenge on the Triads after a failed assault attempt in a laundry shop. After proving himself, Claude is introduced to Joey's father and the head of the Leone Family, Salvatore Leone. Claude is not powerful enough to stay for Joey, Toni, and Salvatore's meeting, so he is instructed to drive around Salvatore's trophy wife, Maria Latore, and saves her from a drug raid in a warehouse party she attended. Salvatore begins trusting Claude, and confides in him that he believes that a bartender named Curly Bob is selling information about the Leone's to the Cartel in exchange for SPANK, an illegal drug. Claude follows Curly Bob and finds out that Catalina and Miguel are now leaders of the Cartel. Claude kills Curly Bob, but Catalina and Miguel escape. Salvatore has Claude, with the help of 8-Ball, blow up the Cartel Ship with their supply of SPANK. For his last mission, Salvatore asks Claude to get rid of a car filled with murder evidence. However, as Claude nears the car's location, Maria pages Claude, saying that the car is a trap, and to meet her at the docks. Should Claude enter the car, it will explode. At the docks, Maria admits that she lied to Salvatore and said she was having an affair with Claude, which caused his rage. Maria introduces him to a Yakuza leader Asuka Kasen and they move to Staunton Island to escape the Leone's. Asuka wants Claude to prove that his ties with Leone's are completely broken by assassinating Salvatore as he is leaving Luigi's club. Claude works for Asuka against the Leone's and the police. She soon introduces Claude to her brother and waka-gashira Kenji Kasen and a corrupt cop Ray Machowski. Claude works for Kenji against the Yardies and the Cartel while he also works for Ray to keep his connections with the Yakuza secret by making him do his dirty work. Ray introduces him to billionaire mogul\u00a0Donald Love and Claude begins working for him. He rescues the Oriental Gentleman from the Cartel, after Love tells him that they are holding him hostage for a ransom. To lower the real estate price of the city, Claude starts a war between the Yakuza and the Cartel by running over Kenji with a Cartel vehicle. He also collects the packages from a plane hangar, however, the Cartel have taken it back to their construction site headquarters, and finds Miguel and Catalina there. Miguel attempts to negotiate with Claude, but Catalina shoots him in the back and escapes. Thinking that the Cartel killed her brother, Asuka arrives to assist Claude and tortures Miguel for information. After helping Love by providing a distraction, Claude returns to the penthouse and finds that he and the Oriental Gentleman have disappeared. He returns to the construction site and finds Asuka and Miguel both dead, with a note from Catalina saying she has kidnapped Maria and will kill her unless he brings $500,000 to the Cartel Mansion. Upon arriving, it is revealed that the exchange was an ambush and Catalina takes Maria away in a helicopter and orders them to kill Claude. Claude escapes and follows the helicopter to the dam. Catalina flies away, leaving Maria on the dam with her men. Claude kills all the men and shoots down the helicopter, killing Catalina. Leaving the dam, Maria begins babbling, and after the screen fades to black, a gunshot is heard. It is unknown if Claude shot Maria to permanently silence her or to keep her quiet.City  Main Article: Liberty City in 3D Universe The game takes place in Liberty City, which is loosely based on New York City, but also incorporates elements of other American cities. There are different districts in Liberty City. It consists of three islands - Portland Island, Staunton Island, and Shoreside Vale. The three islands are comparatively similar to Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Staten Island, respectively. The city was meant to feature buildings modeled after the then World Trade Center, but last minute edits were made to the game to remove them after 9/11.Portland Island  This is the old industrial district, consisting largely of workmen in old cars, the Leones, Triads, and Diablos. The manual's description: This is the first area the player will interact with in the game.Staunton Island  This is the business district. Lots of rich people can be found here, along with their nice cars. The resident gangs are the Yakuza, the Yardies, and Colombian Cartel. The manual's description: Staunton Island is the second of the three districts the player will see in the game.Shoreside Vale  This is the suburban area of Liberty City. The wealthy live here, along with the middle-class residents and gangs. The Francis International Airport is also located here. The local gangs are the Southside Hoods and the Colombian Cartel. The manual's description: This is where the ending of the game takes place.Influences  It could be said that Grand Theft Auto III has the third least amount of influences in the entire GTA series, only having two, which is the movie GoodFellas and the classic TV show The Sopranos as most of the mafia theme in the game was influenced by the both the show and the movie.Reception  Upon release, Grand Theft Auto III was met with near-unanimous critical acclaim. Various critics praised the game for its story, gameplay, and the near unlimited freedom gain to the player; GTA III was touted as revolutionary by several game review websites and publications. GTA III holds a 97/100 on Metacritic, making it (along with Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3) the highest rated PlayStation 2 game on the website. The game holds a 95% on GameRankings, making it the highest rated PlayStation 2 game on the website, as well the second highest rated game of its year, behind Halo. IGN heavily praised the game, giving it a 9.6/10, calling it \"a massive scale operation that just gets better and better as players dig into it, even though it gets ridiculously difficult at points.\" Eurogamer gave the game a perfect 10, calling it \"A luscious, sprawling epic of a game and one of the most complete experiences I have ever encountered. If this is what I've waited a year to see on my PS2, then I would have waited ten. Magnificent\". 1Up.com gave the game an A+, saying \"The best game of the year? Maybe the best game ever\". GameSpot gave the game a 9.6/10. stating \"While the violent nature of the game will surely turn some people off and kids simply shouldn't be allowed anywhere near it, GTA III is, quite simply, an incredible experience that shouldn't be missed by anyone mature enough to handle it\". Game Informer gave it a 9.5/10, stating \"The environments of Liberty City are stunning in scope and detail, dwarfing anything I've ever seen, and your choices are endless\". GameSpy awarded the game with 9.4/10 stating \"A fantastically designed and fun game that's one of the most absorbing, entertaining titles released in a while. It gets better and better with every single day, as you continue discovering new little features here and there. \". Game Revolution gave the game a perfect score, stating \"Just about the best game yet released on the system and one of the most impressive console titles we've ever seen. And I ain't blowing smoke up your tailpipe\". GamePro gave the game a 5/5, stating \"Greatly improved in GTA III is the stunning visual and sound package.\" GamesRadar gave the game a perfect 10, stating \"Almost immediately after your first play you'll realize that underneath the cloak of controversy that will forever shadow GTA3 sits a truly special, groundbreaking and brilliant game. You'll love it.\" Edge was less favorable, rating the game 8/10. The PC version of the game received less positive, yet strong, reception. The PC version has been criticized for performance problems, especially in light of the much smoother performance of Vice City. This was due to technical issues. IGN gave the PC version a 9.4/10, while GameSpot gave it a 9.3/10.Sales  GTA III emerged with an US$49.95 price, becoming the #1 selling game of 2001 in the United States. The game was later discounted to the price of $19 after becoming one of Sony's \"Greatest Hits\". The game has became the second most best-selling game of 2002, behind its sequel, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. As of March 26, 2008, Grand Theft Auto III has sold 14.5 million units according to Take-Two Interactive. GTA III is the fifth best-selling game of the series, behind Grand Theft Auto V,\u00a0Grand Theft Auto IV, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, and Grand Theft Auto: Vice City.10th Anniversary Edition  The 10th Anniversary Edition was announced by Rockstar Games during October 2011. The edition was released for mobile phones and tablets, such as iPod, iPhone and Android. The game was released in fall 2011. A limited edition of Claude action figure is available for pre-order for $149.99; only 1,500 pieces were made. The iOS version of GTA III has received favorable reception, with IGN rewarding it with a 7.5/10.9/11 Terrorist Attacks  Grand Theft Auto III was changed significantly due to the real-world 9/11 terrorist attacks. The game was originally intended to be released on October 3, 2001, however the release was pushed back three weeks, until the 22nd, while Rockstar combed through the game's files. Dan Houser claimed that the main reason the game's release was postponed was due to how close Rockstar Games's head office was to the World Trade Center, and work that had to be done was made impossible due to the circumstances during that period. Dan also claims that, at the time, he came close to cancelling the game's release altogether due to the circumstances; \"This beautiful city has been attacked, and now we're making a violent crime drama set in a city that's not unlike New York City\". Despite this, he claims that it was his duty to release the game, especially considering how close they have come to releasing it. Several changes were made to the game, however Rockstar claims that the changes made to the game only make it about 1% different.. For example, the Police car and Enforcer's color scheme which resembled those of the NYPD's in the early 2000s was changed to an entirely new black and white color scheme, similar to Californian-style police vehicle color schemes. Several aspects of the map were changed, including entire skyscrapers removed due to any possible resemblance of the World Trade Center buildings. The Airtrain at Francis International Airport was made un-solid, to prevent the player from firing rocket launchers at it, and aircraft flight paths that flew through the city were changed. One mission was removed from the game as it referenced terrorism. Certain radio and pedestrian dialogue was also removed. The game's Boxart was changed, too. The original artwork was replaced with an entirely new style of artwork, which is still used to this day - comprising of sections displaying individual pieces of artwork from the game, spread around the box, and the Grand Theft Auto wordmark situated in the center of the box. The original artwork was still used for the European release of the game.Alternate Artwork  In some PAL territories, Grand Theft Auto III was released with different cover artwork, despite there being no major differences in the game itself. Below are examples of several box arts.Trivia See Also Further Reading Official Site External links Characters in GTA IV  This page lists the major characters of Grand Theft Auto IV.

List Additional cards  In the English version of this set, the following cards (which were promo cards in the Japanese version) were added:Clans  \"Clans\" (\u30af\u30e9\u30f3 Kuran) are the factions in Cardfight!! Vanguard, and which each card belongs to one. Likewise, each clan also belongs to a nation. In card text, the name of a clan is mentioned within \"\u300a\u300b\" in the Japanese version, and within \"\u00ab\u00bb\" in the English version. Clans have some Unique Races and Shared Races in them. Unique Races found in most of the clans sometimes make up their main theme to represent themselves with their unique traits. For example, Megacolony is based exclusively on insects. These themes may be used to form a deck, and they are usually themed around a certain ability or trait, such as paralyzing your opponent's units, locking/deleting, calling units from the drop zone, drawing cards, etc. Originally, most cards had restrictions that prevent players from adding cards from other clans (such as Lord or requiring a vanguard from the same clan to use their effects) to discourage clan mixing, however, mixing clans was allowed and wasn't necessarily a bad idea in some cases (such as Overlord/Tri-stinger for Aqua Force decks, or Stil Vampir/Silent Tom for Oracle Think Tank decks). As the introduction of Clan Fight regulation in February 2014 (paralleling the airing of Season 4) essentially outlaws decks with two or more clan (except for some exceptional cases), such restrictions in later cards were removed as they are no longer necessary. Originally, most clans (outside of \"main\" ones like Kagero and Shadow Paladin) only had 4 cards (from grade 0 to 3) and no trigger units in the set they were introduced. In Cardfight!! Vanguard G, top-level fighters (like Mamoru Anjou) are honored with the title of \"Clan Leader\".Gold Paladin  \"Gold Paladin\" (\u30b4\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u30d1\u30e9\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3 G\u014drudo Paradin) is a clan from the nation of United Sanctuary, and introduced in Trial Deck 5: Slash of Silver Wolf alongside Narukami. In the lore, the leader of this clan is\u00a0Incandescent Lion, Blond Ezel. The clan also has seven notable troops, known concurrently as the Gold Paladin Corps, as well as the Liberation army, and the wielders of the Bluish Flame Armaments from the past. In the events of the Cardfight!! Vanguard G series, the Knights of the Sun are a notable troop lead by their charismatic commander, known for his exceptional intelligence and security prowess.Background  Who are the Gold Paladin? Originally a rag-tag team of creatures who would normally be sworn enemies, brought together by the threat of annihilation, this clan has become a disciplined army of the United Sanctuary. Wielding the power of light in one hand and the power of darkness in the other, the Gold Paladin will defend the Sanctuary to the finish. What is the Shadow Paladin Investigation Unit? A faction of the Gold Paladin created to investigate reports of havoc being wreaked by the Shadow Paladin, specifically the clique led by the nefarious Claret Sword Dragon. Led by Gurguit, one of the Gold Paladin's strongest, the unit arrested many Shadow Paladin within in a short period of time. However, this made Gurguit the target of Claret Sword Dragon. What is Gold Paladin? (Card of the Day 7th March 2016) It is the Second Regular Army of the Holy Nation \"United Sanctuary\". In the past, it was established as the coalition of the Holy Knightly Order and the Shadow Knightly Order to liberate the sealed heroes. After the war, the knights of shadow, having liberated the Hero of Darkness, parted company with Gold Paladin, and Gold Paladin was reorganized into the Second Regular Army under the command of the King of Knights, and came to modern times. Their major missions are securing and protecting borders with contact with the neighbouring nations, holding investigation and expedition in the neighbouring nations, and relaying messages to the capital. The Disassembly of the Investigation Unit, and the Establishment of the New Troop Some time before the end of the civil war caused by \"Shadow Paladin\", the Special Investigation Unit was disassembled due to the severe injuries suffered by the captain, \"Gurguit\". Nevertheless, the achievement the Investigation Unit had made so far, and the high reputation of Gurguit, led to the decision of establishing a new troop centered around Gurguit. As the troop has just been established, its name hasn't been decided yet, but people call its members \"Knights of the Sun\" from the features of their armament. By the way, the troop received high expectation as the members are young elites, but they could not make achievement as expected, and the troop's reputation has been dropping gradually. It is rumoured that the disassembly of the new troop is being examined. What will the mentally stressed Gurguit become---Playstyle  After\u00a0both the\u00a0Royal Paladins and the Shadow Paladins were sealed\u00a0away in the events leading to the War of Liberation, the\u00a0Gold Paladins\u00a0were created by the remaining\u00a0members of the Royal Paladin and Shadow Paladin clans. Naturally, the Gold Paladin's playstyle is a combination of its progenitors'. Most units emphasizes multiple call and empower (such as Ezel and the Liberators), while few others retire their owner's rear-guards to activate their effects (such as Spectral Duke Dragon and the Bluish Flame group of the Liberators). Gold Paladin's search abilities is limited at a few cards from the top of the deck, somewhat restricted compared to its predecessors, who can search the entire deck, but gains the right to call anything from among them in turn. The original limit is only one card from the top of deck. The search limit is expanded during the Legion Mate Era, to three or four. And finally up to five during the G era. Regardless of the increased, only one unit may be called for each search, in general. In Cardfight!! Vanguard G, specifically with the Gurguit archetype, the clan gained its keyword \"Unite\", which is fulfilled by their playstyle of multiple calls. The archetype also have an ability to superior call cards to (GC) for further defense, and the call (including other normal calls) count towards \"Unite\".Known/Notable Fighters Trivia Booster Set 5: Awakening of Twin Blades  Awakening of Twin Blades is the 5th Booster Set released in the Japanese/Korean format, and the 7th\u00a0released in the English format.Contents Illustrators  \u4f0a\u85e4\u5f70\uff0fAzusa\uff0fDaisuke Izuka\uff0fEel\uff0ffunbolt\uff0fHirokorin\uff0fkoji\uff0fKou Takano\uff0fMorechand\uff0fNINNIN\uff0fRyo-ta.H\uff0ftoi8\uff0fToMo\uff0ftouge666\uff0funi\uff0fZB\uff0f\u5b89\u9054\u6d0b\u4ecb\uff0f\u96e8\u5bae\u6176\u592a\uff0f\u4f0a\u54b2\u30a6\u30bf\uff0f\u77f3\u7530\u30d0\u30eb\uff0f\u30a4\u30c8\u30a6\u30e8\u30a6\u30a4\u30c1\uff0f\u53f6\u4e4b\u660e\uff0f\u6728\u4e0b\u52c7\u6a39\uff0f\u7c73\u8c37\u5c1a\u5c55\uff0f\u8336\u58f1\uff0f\u9f4b\u85e4\u30bf\u30f6\u30aa\uff0f\u9f4b\u85e4\u76f4\u8475\uff0f\u6c99\u6751 \u5e83\u660e\uff0f\u5c71\u5b97\uff0f\u30b9\u30ba\u30ad\u30b4\u30ed\u30a6\uff0f\u30bf\u30a4\u30ad\uff0f\u9ad8\u7530\u660e\u7f8e\uff0f\u30bf\u30ab\u30e4\u30de\u30c8\u30b7\u30a2\u30ad\uff0f\u7af9\u6d6a\u79c0\u884c\uff0f\u7530\u6240\u54f2\u5e73\uff0f\u305f\u306b\u3081\u305d\uff0f\u5343\u8449\u30b5\u30c9\u30eb\uff0f\u3066\u308b\u307f\u3043\uff0f\u8429\u8c37\u85ab\uff0f\u30d1\u30c8\u30ea\u30b7\u30a2\uff0f\u524d\u6cb3\u60a0\u4e00\uff0f\u524d\u7530\u30d2\u30ed\u30e6\u30ad\uff0f\u96c5\uff0f\u5897\u7530\u5e79\u751f\uff0f\u677e\u5cf6\u4e00\u592b\uff0f\u78a7\u98a8\u7fbd\uff0f\u4e09\u597d\u8f09\u514b\uff0f\u6751\u679d\u8ce2\u4e00\uff0f\u6751\u702c\u502b\u592a\u90ce\uff0f\u6751\u5c71\u7adc\u5927\uff0f\u7791\u4e38\u30a4\u30cc\u30c1\u30e8\uff0f\u5c71\u5d0e\u592a\u90ce\uff0f\u5c71\ufa11\u5948\u82d7\uff0f\u7d50\u57ce\u907c\u4e5f\uff0f\u7531\u5229\u771f\u73e0\u90ce\uff0f\u4f59\u6e56\u88d5\u8f1d\uff0f\u7adc\u5fb9\uff0f\u9df2\u5c3e\u76f4\u5e83Card List Additional cards  In the English version of this set, the following cards (which were promo cards in the Japanese version) were added:Booster Set 1: Descent of the King of Knights  Descent of the King of Knights is the 1st Booster Set released in the Japanese/Korean and English format.Contents  There are a total of 80 cards (RRR x8, RR x12, R x20, C x40) + SP cards x12 (Parallel).

In the lore, this clan is the strongest military in all of Planet Cray.Background  Bombardment Troop \"Kagero\" It is the land assault troop composed of dragons, dragonoids, and machines modeled after them. The dragons and machines both possess combat strength exceeding that of modern weapons. It is one of the strongest army that has prominent strength to turn cruel operations into reality. The army is centered around flame dragons. What is \"Kagero\"? (Card of the Day 3rd May 2016) It is the First Army of \"Dragon Empire\", and the attack troop led by the flame dragons. The army is composed of warriors centered around flame dragons, dragon knights and dragonmen, and boasts of overwhelming offensive power. It is a leading army of the world, with both power of dragons and technology of humans.Playstyle  Kagero's theme of \"fire\" is prominent in its effects, with a focus on \"burning\" the opponent's resources. The main way they do this is by retiring the opponent's rear-guards to gain advantages and weaken, or outright ruin, the opponent's battle formation. The \"Blaze\" keyword, primarily used by the Blademaster archetype, activates if the player has more rear-guards than the opponent. Each military troop within the clan has its own methods of benefiting and using the retiring mechanic. The Overlord's add a focus on beatdown tactics by restanding the vanguard after attacking certain units, allowing the player to burn the opponent's field while also gaining more drive checks. More recently they have gained a greater focus on retiring and pressuring the opponent through effect damage and the gaining of power and drive checks based on the opponents damage. Dauntless, like Overlord, also restands, but utilizes the trigger checks gained by restanding to power up the vanguard while also retiring the opponent's rear-guards. The Perdition troop retire rear-guards based on columns, while powering up from these retires. They can also chain retires as well. The Seal Dragons allow the opponent to superior call grade 2 units from the top of the opponent's deck, but in doing so gain power from the opponent having multiple grade 2 units on the field, preventing them from intercepting, and even retiring them. Nouvelle directly penalizes the opponent the most, by preventing them from guarding with certain cards, and even nullifying trigger checks.Known/Notable Fighters Trivia Aichi Sendou  \"Aichi Sendou\" is the main protagonist of Cardfight!! Vanguard anime and manga. He is also the main protagonist of Cardfight!! Vanguard Movie: Neon Messiah, along with Toshiki Kai. For the duration of season 4, Aichi was sealed by his own volition to keep Link Joker sealed away with him, while leaving his friends in the dark. Consequently, Kai set out to find Aichi and becomes the main protagonist during this period, although the spotlight is still on him. As a result of playing host to the Void's seed, Aichi himself ends up becoming the final hurdle in Kai's quest to bring him back. In Cardfight!! Vanguard G, Aichi is studying abroad in America and is recruited by Ibuki to help with Plan G. Because of his absence, Team Q4 is forced to fight Team TRY3 in the G Quest's Ultimate stage without him. He also sends his Stride Force to Chrono Shindou during his fight against Ryuzu. In Cardfight!! Vanguard G: NEXT, he comes back to Japan during summer break and goes to meet Ibuki Kouji with Chrono. He is a somewhat shy and timid young man who wishes to be a Vanguard Fighter, but has never had the chance to have a real\u00a0fight until his second encounter with Kai. When starting to play Vanguard, he believes more in himself, becoming a powerful Vanguard Fighter. His Vanguard Circle's color is blue; but when using a Shadow Paladin deck, the color changes to dark blue.Name  According to Kerokero Ace September 2011, Aichi's surname is written with the kanji for vanguard (\u5148\u5c0e), the forward element in a military formation (and, of course, a reference to the title of the franchise). His forename primarily refers to the Aichi prefecture of Chubu, Japan. This follows a general trend in Vanguard of using historical names for characters. \"Aichi\" as a name originates from the third volume of the Man'y\u014dsh\u016b, Japan's oldest collection of poetry, where it was referred to as Ayuchi, the Ayuchi-gata tidal flats.\u00a0History  When he was younger, Aichi was a very shy and lonely boy who was frequently bullied at school. During the fateful encounter with Kai, who was still a friendly teenager, he gave him the card Blaster Blade, telling him to imagine himself big and strong, like the royal knight depicted on the card. Aichi couldn't picture himself any stronger at that moment, but the card gave him courage. He constructed a deck in the hopes of finding Kai and having a cardfight with him, but shortly after their encounter, Kai had apparently moved away. He eventually transferred to a different school after his mom got upset over the constant bullying. Aichi lives with his mother and little sister, Emi. It is shown that Aichi isn't interested in school that much and his sister always wakes him up, though this behavior disappears after he starts playing Cardfight!! Vanguard.Personality  At first, he is a shy, taciturn and timid boy who doesn't stand out, but is always kind and nice to everyone. After he starts playing Vanguard, he starts to come out of his shell and appears more confident in himself, resulting in a boost on his Cardfight skills. During the regional tournament, he doubted his ability when Misaki wouldn't make it in time for most of the tournament, and again when he was paired up to fight Gouki in the finals, but through winning the team's first match, and some encouragement from Kai, he regained his confidence and grew determined to win. After Aichi gains PSY Qualia, he begins to act very much like Ren Suzugamori; arrogant and obsessed with growing stronger, yet staying eerily polite throughout, which he frequently displayed once Ren gave him a Shadow Paladin deck, which appears to fuel his PSY Qualia. After Kai brought him back, Aichi started doubting himself, but quickly gets over it after seeing his friends having fun during a shop tournament at Card Capital. During Season 2, he displays more of his calm and determined personality while he was fighting with other fighters, even when he was in the brink of losing against Christopher Lo after the latter got PSY Qualia powers. However, he grows increasingly worried when his Royal Paladins were replaced by the Gold Paladins, and desperate for answers as to what happened. This starts to lessen after fighting with the new clan and learning to respect it. After facing fighters like Kourin and Jun, he begins to forge his own path, growing stronger with each fight. He refuses to leave his friends in trouble if he can help them, even when the circumstances dictate that it is a waste of valuable time, as shown when he accepted Christopher's rematch to try and break him out of his PSY Qualia-induced madness, even when Cray and Earth were in danger. In Season 3, it is shown that Aichi, outside of any Cardfight!! Vanguard-related event, is still quite unsure and nervous, but this side of him completely vanishes whenever he plays. He also starts to act more like a leader in the Cardfight Club. Naoki, Rekka, and Kourin have all noted that during their fights with him, he seems like a different person, only looking forward and having his sights set on winning. Based on his cardfighting ability and place in Miyaji, Aichi is highly intelligent and perceptive, though this is mostly hidden by his shyness. His intelligence is seen in his cardfight strategies and ability to keep his deck evolving, and his perceptiveness allowed him to see Naoki Ishida had been reversed even if he didn't know what was actually wrong with his friend. Even so, he is dense when not cardfighting especially when he fails to realize Kourin had a crush on him and when Naoki bought a deck to cardfight him. In Season 4 after waking up under the influence of Link Joker, Aichi is show to have become cold and cruel under its effects, striking Kourin and Philippe Neve with his dark power. He also fought ruthlessly during his cardfight against Kai, showing determination to be sealed away again. At that time, he felt that there was no other way to save Earth and Cray from Link Joker other than to disappear from the world. However, he had a slight change of heart when he realized that everybody was willing to take his burden in order to end his misery of being the host of the Seed. He had also shown more care and concern towards Kourin, during the times when she tried to take more of his agony and when he saved her from the Link Joker miasma. His wish to prevent the incident from happening again was apparent as he was able to hold back Link Joker for a prolonged time despite the clan's efforts to break his soul and body. After his fate was changed by his friends and Planet Cray, he was able to relieve his burdens of the future. In NEXT, he is more confident than before but still very clumsy as he misses his train while helping some foreigners. He is very caring and offers to buy Chrono and Kamui drinks. When he plays Vanguard, he becomes a completely different person, becoming more confident in himself and concentrating on the game. In the Cardfight!! Vanguard manga, Aichi (during the Link Joker arc) becomes a very cold person under the influence of Psy Qualia Zombie's effect.Appearance  Aichi is a boy with long blue hair with a right hair bang which is his signature style. He is first seen in his Hitsue Middle School uniform which is mostly all gray with white linings along with a red sweater under it. His civilian clothes varies with the change in season particularly wearing a short green jacket with a red sweater under it for cold seasons while sporting a white double sleeved shirt for warm seasons. He is quite particularly short compared to other characters of the same grade. By the start of the second season, he still wears his middle school uniform but he is mostly seen in his civilian clothes by the time of the VF Circuit which is a white jacket with a red sweater beneath it. In the start of the third season, he is now a high school student at Miyaji Academy wearing the basic male uniform which is a black blazer with red linings along with a white formal shirt underneath it and a red necktie. By this time, he has short hair but still maintaining his signature right hair bang and has significantly grown taller. His civilian clothing shown so far is a varying colored jacket of dark purple and white while having a light purple sweater underneath. In the fourth season, as the host of Link Joker, he wears a general coat schemed with red & black and his clothes shares the same theme as the Quatre Knights. After finally appearing he is shown to have shorter hair, dull eyes and he may have possibly grown slightly taller. He also has a cold and cruel look on his face due to Link Joker's effects, and the signature black and red aura. In sixth season, he is shown that he is still wearing a white jacket with the same blue haired color. His attire is still the same as what he had in Season 3 when he was fighting against Reverse. In NEXT, he has a light blue jacket and jeans. He has grown taller and his hair has grown noticeably as well.Abilities  In the beginning of the series, he was used by Cray as one of the keys in the war between the Royal Paladin and Shadow Paladins. However, after the end of the Link Joker invasion, his spiritual strength was on par with Takuto, even though not as strong as the host of Ezel. This was later proven as Planet Cray was willing to save him from his fate of being sealed away together with Link Joker and the units having faith in him to save their world.Connection to Planet Cray  He is shown to have PSY Qualia, which was later revealed that this power is a key to link the fighter to Planet Cray. After the Link Joker invasion, in between the events of season 3 and 4, he was able to meet the respective Quatre Knights locations, even though it was unexplained how he was able to arrive there. Before the arrival of the Quatre Knights to the Sanctuary, some of his powers were transferred to Kourin and a card Companion Star Star-vader, Photon appears as Kourin's avatar, showing his ability to create cards like Suiko and giving Kourin the ability to use Link Joker on her own free will, despite being under Link Joker's control himself during the cardfight against Philippe Neve. He was able to turn the respective Quatre Knights's cards to talismans, which reflect their type of prisons they have. After defeating Takuto in Neon Messiah his PSY Qualia was enhanced, allowing him to bring back units from the brink of death. Also, he was able to see Brandt.Memory Manipulation  Like Takuto, he also possesses an ability to erase or manipulate any memory of his existence to most individuals, like how the existence of the 3 clans were forgotten in the Asia Circuit Arc. Despite that, there are a few flaws as Kai was not affected by it possibly due to Blaster Blade's arrival in Kai's dream. Even Naoki, Misaki, Miwa and Kamui were able to remember him after some significant cardfights, in which Aichi even noted that it was a major mistake he made. The Sanctuary's foundation, which was formed by Aichi's will, has the ability to erase memories of an individual connected to him if they lose a cardfight, with the exception of the Knights and Kourin (due to making a pact with him to protect him and Planet Cray). His existence was brought back after the Sanctuary breaks down.Physical Abilities  He also demonstrated his strong willpower, shown when he was able to suppress Link Joker within him for several days after the Reverse event. It was even demonstrated even further when he was able to hold and absorb his dark powers with a bit of help from Kourin before the Knights arrival and with Neve's help after waking up from Link Joker's complete control over him, either being rendered unconscious or showing noticeable signs of exhaustion, though it was stated by Gaillard that it was life threatening. He also exhibited some physical strength and was deceptively fast despite his looks, when he saves Kourin Tatsunagi from the Link Joker miasma in the nick of time and carrying her to the throne.Biography Season 1  Aichi is a student in Hitsue Middle School. He is introduced as a self-contained boy with low self-esteem, as seen when he is asked by his teacher to base an opinion, to which he gives an answer that makes him seem cowardly in appearance to the other students. When Kai introduced to Vanguard, he gained a lot of friends like Morikawa, Miwa and Izaki, and later his teammates that becomes his best friends - Kai Toshiki, Misaki Tokura and Kamui Katsuragi. Aichi continues to play Vanguard with his friends at Card Shop Capital, thus progressively getting better at the game until he places fourth in the Card Shop Tournament. As a result, he joins Team Quadrofolio (Q4) to invest more in the game. When Q4 begins to play in the Regionals, he becomes friend with members of teams like Handsome, and when they forward to Nationals, he become friend with members of Team Caesar. He loses the Nationals to the Teams Jurassic\u00a0Army and AL4 in the third match, but gained a lot of experience because of it.\u00a0 However, as the series progresses, Aichi discovers PSY Qualia, an unusual power that allows him to hear the voices of his cards and see his path to victory. Placing his trust in these voices, Aichi begins to rely on his own skill less and more in favor of PSY Qualia. Kai leaves Aichi, partially out of guilt over what happened to Ren, but not without coldly telling Aichi he has only gotten weaker. Confused over Kai's words, Aichi stumbles into Card Shop PSY, where he meets Ren again. Ren gives Aichi a Shadow Paladin deck and tells him that it will give him the strength he needs. He takes the deck because he believes that he can use it to show Kai that Aichi indeed had grown stronger, when in reality the deck fueled the dark intentions of his power. Aichi then uses this deck to utterly defeat Kourin.\u00a0 Later in the series, after Team Q4 qualify through the Preliminaries of their second National Championship, Kai fights Aichi, in order to try and prevent PSY Qualia from totally consuming him as it did Ren. When the fight is almost over, Aichi has a vision of Blaster Blade that tells him that he has a big strength that he's always had, and he doesn't need a perfect constructed deck to win. After recognizing Blaster Blade as his true Avatar, Aichi stops using his PSY Qualia, although his cards answered his call during his fight with Kenji Mitsusada. However, Ren noted that Aichi won without PSY Qualia, as did Kai. Later, Aichi goes to Foo Fighters' headquarters with Ultra-Rare to watch the fight between Kai and Ren, with the former losing. Ren noted that he received Phantom Blaster Overlord from Suiko in the process. After the battle, Aichi tries to comfort Kai, but Kai tells Aichi to get away from him\u00a0and storms off. Suiko then manifests two spheres of energy, one of darkness and the other of light, and says that Ren chose the path of darkness and now Aichi must choose his path, and presumably a new card. After the battle between Kai and Ren, Aichi and Q4 (minus Kai) return to the stadium for the finals of the National Tournament to fight Team Foo Fighter AL4. Aichi remains on the sidelines while Kamui fights Tetsu and Misaki fights Asaka. After these battles Aichi takes the field to battle Ren in the final match of the tournament. Throughout the match Ren tempts Aichi to use his PSY Qualia ability but Aichi constantly refuses while Ren constantly uses PSY Qualia to cause Aichi to feel the pain of each of Ren's attacks. Aichi eventually succumbs to the temptation after he calls Blaster Dark to his Rear Guard. Using PSY Qualia's power, he then begins to unleash his full power on Ren, causing Ren to feel the attack from Aichi's units just as Ren had done to Aichi previously. From the stands, Kai shouts to Aichi not to fall back into PSY Qualia's grasp and brings Aichi back to his senses once more. After Ren Crossrides Phantom Blaster Overlord, Aichi is backed into a corner when his guard is broken and Phantom Blaster Overlord's attack hits. After checking a Heal Trigger, Aichi proceeds to ride Majesty Lord Blaster and defeat Ren using its skill as well as removing the power of PSY Qualia from Ren. After the match, Aichi and Team Q4 are crowned the National Champions. A few days after the tournament, Aichi runs to Card Capital to see his friends while saying that he can no longer use PSY Qualia. As he enters Card Capital, all his friends are there waiting for him, including Kai who has been waiting to battle him. Aichi then proceeds to start a battle with Kai.Season 2  During season 2, he uses a Gold Paladin deck. Aichi is taking part in Asia Circuit and travels around Asia to fight different fighters, along with the rest of Team Q4. In episode 66, he fights Takuto Tatsunagi, who has a Gold Paladin deck. After the fight, he realizes his deck consists of Gold Paladin units instead of Royal Paladins. Aichi is told that Shadow Paladin, Royal Paladin, and Kager\u014d have been sealed away. Eventually, Aichi finds Kai, and discovers that his deck has changed too, although Kai is unaware of the change, unlike Aichi. Kai and Aichi then start a battle, in order to try and determine what really has happened. However, Aichi is unsure without his old deck to play with and is swiftly defeated by Kai's new ace, Dragonic Kaiser Vermillion, who demonstrates the new Limit Break ability. In episode 68, Aichi takes on Kamui, in order to try and convince him to come to the VF Circuit with him, and battles with his Gold Paladin deck, even using the Limit Break for the first time. Once Aichi and Q4 land in Singapore, they meet up with Kenji Mitsusada and Team Caesar by chance, and then meet with a boy named Christopher Lo and his teammates, Lee Shenlon and Pajeel Ali, of Team S.I.T. Genius. After parting ways with Teams Caesar and S.I.T. Genius Aichi sees Takuto in a car driving away and proceeds to give chase. After being denied an audience with Takuto, he walks through town until Kourin finds him and proceeds to give him his new trump card, Incandescent Lion, Blond Ezel. Aichi's quest to see Takuto again, however, is brought to a halt, when Takuto appears in the middle of Aichi's fight with Christopher Lo. Takuto grants both players the power of PSY Qualia, which Christopher uses to defeat Aichi before he can begin to re-understand his new power. Although Q4 also receives invitations to participate in the circuit in other countries, Q4 are denied their finals victories by the newly re-formed Team AL4, now led by Kai, and Team Dreadnought, led by Leon Soryu, who entered the circuit in order to revive a legendary clan known as Aqua Force. Later on, Aichi realizes that his lack of progress is due to his own hesitation regarding the correct use of PSY Qualia, but he learns to overcome them after a match with Ultra-Rare. His new resolve results in the acceptance of a new ace card, Blazing Lion, Platina Ezel. With this card, Q4 are finally able to win the Japan leg of the VF Circuit. However, he and the other finalists are drawn to Cray via a portal connecting Cray to Earth, where he learns the VF Circuit's true purpose; Cray is in danger of a threat known as Void, and is responsible for the sealing of the clans who united the others. The whole tournament was held in order to find chosen cardfighters who could save Cray from Void. Leon Soryu, however, reveals that he made a deal with Void in order to revive the Aqua Force in exchange for eliminated all threats to Void. With his wildly-evolved PSY Qualia and mastery of the powers that Void handed to him, Soryu betrays Tatsunagi, draining him of his own powers and leaving the boy for dead. He then separates each team who made the finals, and Aichi is forced to look for Leon and stop him. While searching, he finds the spirit of his lost Avatar, Blaster Blade, which manifests in the form of a beam of light, which points towards Leon, and as a new unit, Blaster Blade Spirit. Q4 then bump into Team S.I.T Genius, where Aichi discovers that Christopher Lo has been completely consumed by PSY Qualia. Seeing himself in Christopher, Aichi decides to try and snap him out of it, as Kai did for him. Aichi succeeds in winning the fight, banishing Team S.I.T Genius from Cray, as only the winners can remain. However, this fight delays Aichi, and he is too late to stop Leon from defeating Kai and banishing Team new AL4 from the space as well. Aichi fights Leon to avenge Kai and stop Leon's plot. After a hard-fought fight, which results in the return of his Avatar and the Crossride of Platina Ezel, Aichi narrowly escapes defeat and succeeds in saving Cray. Afterwards, when he re-discovers the Royal Paladins, Aichi realizes that he has forged a bond with his Gold Paladin allies and cannot bear the thought of simply abandoning them. Understanding his feelings, Blaster Blade, as well as the other Royal Paladins he fought with, manifest in the form of new Gold Paladins. Aichi then makes the true finals of the VF Circuit, where he officially defeats Christopher Lo, ending in Q4 becoming the champions of the tournament.Season 3  Aichi re-enrolls in Miyaji Academy with Misaki. However, when he settles into his old school again, it becomes apparent that his hobby has little place in a school where the primary concern is college. At the end of school, he goes to Card Capital and a regular student, Naoki Ishida, follows him. Aichi teaches him how to play Vanguard, and introduces his new deck. Although Aichi wins, he notices that Naoki bought a Trial Deck, which means he is now interested in Vanguard. He then decides to keep an eye on him. He tries to start a Cardfight Club at his school, but many people only wanted to join because Kourin was a member, so it resulted in there only being three members;\u00a0Naoki Ishida, Kourin Tatsunagi, and Aichi. In addition, the Student Council, who disapproved of the formation of such a club, frequently spread rumors and put a bounty on the Cardfight Club to dismantle them.\u00a0Eventually they added Shingo Komoi\u00a0and Misaki Tokura, completing the Cardfight Club. However, the club was not approved by the Student Council as they also did not have a teacher to advise them. As an alternative, the Student Council President challenged them to face Hitsue High's Cardfight Club, rewarding them with approval and an advisor should they win. By the time Aichi fights, the results are tied up leaving it up to Aichi to save the Cardfight Club. He faces off against Morikawa whose deck was switched out\u00a0in favor of\u00a0Kai's Kager\u014d deck which utilized Dragonic Overlord The End and the Kager\u014d's new Break Ride as a way for Kai to test him. Aichi manages to break through impressing even Kai with how strong he has become. This victory establishes the Cardfight Club within Miyaji Academy as Aichi is named President and Captain of the club. During the regionals for the High School VF Circuit, his team begins the tournament defeating Hitsue High with Aichi coming out victorious against a strong willed Izaki. By the finals, Aichi faces off against Ren to decide the winner of the tournament, but in the end Aichi fails to defeat Ren and the club is knocked out of the next stage of the Circuit. He returns to his duties as club president only to find himself getting a strange premonition about his friends. Soon he faces against Naoki who is being controlled by Link Joker defeats him. He also starts getting strange feelings as Kourin has not attended school for a while and Kai has not shown up to Card Capital as well. Later on, he is shown to lead his club on a hike trip around the camp site that the whole academy is taking as a relaxing trip. He and his team made it first out of everyone and the other students are rather impressed at that. At night, the whole club gathered around to watch the high school cardfight tournament, they were joined by other students along with the Football club and the Paranormal Research Society though Kourin was a no show. He with Naoki and Shingo made a vow to win the next tournament. The next day, he and the others worked together to enjoy their time on the trip. At night, Kourin asked Aichi to walk with her to the legendary tree next to the lake. When they reached there, Kourin told Aichi to fight her in a cardfight. Not wanting to disappoint her, he agreed to it while Misaki calmly watched from a far. During the fight, she displayed a sign of being Reversed, however, at the last minute, she was able to break free of it. She, then, ran off without a word while Aichi and Misaki wondered what was happening. When on the bus back to school, he wondered and worried for what is happening to Kourin. When Aichi returned to Miyaji High School, he felt bad premonitions during the bus ride back and immediately ran out only to find Kamui who was just defeated by Kourin and in the process of getting Reversed and the Student Council Secretary, Maki Nagashiro,\u00a0showing a video of the Reversed Takuto who declared it to be the beginning of the destruction of the world. Upon returning to Card Capital, Miwa shows himself and reveals that Kai has been reversed all for the sake of facing Aichi. Soon after Miwa leaves, he is confronted by Leon who plans on facing Kai and Takuto. He challenges Aichi for the sake of seeing if both are prepared for the threat but after Aichi rides Blaster Blade Liberator, Leon suddenly stops the Cardfight stating that Aichi is hesitating to fight Kai saying that the strong wind from when he usually brings out Blaster Blade isn't there. Aichi realizes this hesitation and reflects on his doubts. Soon he hears of Naoki and Shingo missing for a day realizing that the both of them are attempting to liberate Miyaji Academy. When Aichi and Misaki head over, they find that the black ring hovering over the school is disappearing. As they find an exhausted Shingo and Naoki, Naoki having just defeated Maki, Shingo revealed that Naoki decided to take on all of these cardfighters for Aichi. Inspired by Naoki's passion and courage, Aichi decides to storm the Tatsunagi Corporation with the intent to defeat Kamui, Kai, Takuto and whoever else stands in his way in defeating the Link Joker. Upon making his way there with Misaki, Naoki and Shingo, he encounters Kamui who challenges him. Kamui reminds him\u00a0that\u00a0when they formed\u00a0Team Q4, Aichi was barely keeping up against Kamui, slowly becoming equals\u00a0but soon enough, it became obvious that\u00a0Aichi\u00a0became much stronger than Kamui.\u00a0Kamui manages to get his Crossbreak Ride off with Ethics Buster \u042feverse\u00a0delivering a full eight attacks but combined with a couple Quintet Walls and a strong guard, Aichi holds out stating that it's through the bonds of Q4 that he was able to get as far as he is now and that Kamui is one of his strongest rivals. He solidifies this by Crossbreak Riding Gancelot Zenith and after superior calling Blaster Blade Liberator, defeats Kamui and returns him to normal as he now is accompanying the group. He watches the Misaki's fight against Miwa and ultimately ends up fighting Kai as well. Confident that he can bring back Kai, he does well against Link Joker for the first time. However, Aichi fails to defeat him as Kai ends the fight by Break Riding Star Vader, Chaos Breaker Dragon and breaking Aichi's Quintet Wall. Upon being defeated, Aichi would have ended up being Reversed, prolonging the process through his own willpower, but Leon with Sharlene and Jillian luckily came in time with a mirror holding Takuto, who helps Aichi tap into his PSY Qualia and temporarily suppressing the Reverse process. However, the strain of holding back such a power has affected him as Aichi cannot engage in a cardfight otherwise the power would rush out all at once and would threaten his life, thus benching him for the time being. However, Aichi, not wanting to sit out while his friends are in trouble, rushes in only to arrive as soon as Takuto is absorbed by the Reversed Takuto. Unwavering, he challenges Reversed Takuto to a cardfight. However, before he gets a chance to, Takuto has Kourin fight Aichi instead, Aichi deciding fight to free Kourin from the reverse. However, during the fight, he is clearly seen struggling to hold himself together but with his desire not to lose his friends to darkness, he manages to defeat Kourin with his new card,\u00a0Liberator, Monarch Sanctuary Alfred. He confronts Takuto with this deck, however Takuto begins to slowly lock his field during the cardfight until he locks his open spot on the field with a unit in his deck setting up for\u00a0Star-vader, \"Omega\" Glendios' Ultimate Break all the while chipping away at his damage. Takuto taunts Aichi that in defeating him, he releases everyone from the reverse, Aichi's suppressed reverse included, but in doing so, he denies cardfighters their strength and would also deny Kourin her memories of her time with him and his friends. But when he sees images of his friends fighting the incoming Link Joker army, he gets his second wind saying that they will find their own strength eventually and even if Kourin loses her memories, he'll find her again and make new ones. Aichi solidifies this hope by riding Alfred against Takuto and shows off Alfred's ability to liberate his locked units. With a full field, he defeats Takuto and liberates the world from reverse and Link Joker. As Takuto is being absorbed back into the void, he tries to take Aichi with him but the real Takuto regains control of the body and drags him into the void with him. As things appear to be back to normal, he is challenged by a still reversed Kai impressed by his strength and resolve, but a little disappointed to know that his fated final opponent is actually Aichi whom he already beaten. However, as Kai is about to be unreversed, he wants to see how Aichi does at his full strength before he loses his reversed Kager\u014d deck. As the fighters clash, Kai states that he knew what he was doing the entire time and that by nature, a cardfighter's job is always to find new strength, no matter the cost, and upon finishing this cardfight, win or lose, he will leave and disappear from everyone's lives. Not satisfied with Kai's self alienation, Aichi says that Kai is his idol, and without him, he wouldn't be the man he is today. He states that Kai should stay with his friends in that case and instead of walking away from them. Aichi then rides Blaster Blade, the card that began his journey, a unit which Kai says defines Aichi. In response Kai rides the unit that defines himself, Dragonic Overlord but soon takes it a step further by Crossbreak Riding\u00a0Dragonic Overlord \"The \u042fe-birth\"\u00a0and demonstrate to him the power Link Joker had given him. Aichi manages to hold off long enough in order to Ride Alfred and fill up his field and superior calling Blaster Blade for Alfred's Ultimate Break. He finished the match by finishing Kai off with Blaster Blade who sees that Aichi became strong through his allies and friends while Kai tried to become strong by shutting everyone away from his life.Season 4  A few days after saving the world from Link Joker and saving Kai from himself and from the will to use the power of Link Joker, Aichi mysteriously disappears not only from school and the card shop but also from everyone's memories including his family relatives. Aichi is seen at the end of episode 164,\u00a0sitting on a throne at an unknown location. In episode 166, he is seen in Ishida's dream telling him he cannot be with them. Later in episode 169, it said that Aichi is in a supposed slumber and that the Quatre Knights inherited his will. In episode 174, Olivier Gaillard states that if Aichi wishes it, the Quatre Knights will show no mercy to Aichi's so-called mates. In episode 177, Aichi is seen seating on his throne, addressing his mates. Aichi ordered his mates to stop trying to rescue him and wished them \"Goodbye\" for he does not want to see them. As revealed by Ren and Leon in episode 179, Aichi had approached them both and offered each of them a position as one his Quatre Knights. Ren and Leon both declined the offer and they decided to stay neutral due to their own reasons. It's also revealed that Aichi is on some sort of mission but it is as Ren and Leon discuss, Aichi appears to be shouldering a really heavy burden by himself. So he made a decision of picking the four best players of the world and formed the Quatre Knights in order to seal him up and protect him from the Seed of the Void. Before the Knights arrival to the palace after he managed to convince them, he holds back Link Joker to buy some time. His agony had caused Kourin to be involved in his situation when she was transported to his location, regaining her memories and a card Photon, which represents their pact appears after some of his powers was transferred to her. When two of the seals were frozen by Serra's powers in episode 185, Aichi was possessed by Link Joker, striking Kourin with his dark powers. Afterwards, he ended up in a cardfight against Neve in his Steel Wall Prison in episode 186 and 187, using a Link Joker deck. During the cardfight, he managed to break out of Link Joker's control in brief moments thanks to Neve who tried to reach his feelings, only to be taken over again and ultimately won. He finally was able to completely snap out of Link Joker's possession when Neve received Judgement from his own prison and fainted after he was carried back to the throne. After Ratie's seal was down due to her loss to Serra in episode 189, Aichi tried to hold back Link Joker despite his weakened condition from the previous battle. It was then Kourin uses her deck to absorb his dark powers, allowing him to relax. Realizing what she was doing, he held up his hand to her deck to stop her from absorbing more of his powers before he lost consciousness again. In episode 191, he woke up and saved Kourin from the Link Joker miasma after her loss to Naoki and commented to her on how she had taken on his suffering again. He then carried her to the throne for her to rest and absorbed the miasma from her deck. He agreed to let Gaillard have one last cardfight with Kai to redeem himself and witnessed Kai and Gaillard's final battle, commenting that both of them are having fun. In episode 193, he then explained to Kai on why he had chosen to seal himself away. When he learned that Kai was guided by Blaster Blade, he showed him the card, only to be corrupted by Link Joker, as Star-vader, Blaster Joker. He then cardfight against Kai to determine his own fate and future. When Kai mentioned on how his precious mates had went through all of this just to take him back, he ignored his words and replied that no matter how strong the bonds are, they won't be able to save him. He then rides Blaster Joker, using his Legion skill to push Kai to a tough spot. However, Kai barely managed to delay his victory, frustrating him in the process. When Kai uses Aichi's own plan to seal himself against him, he was shaken by Kai's question and became doubtful of his own thought of sacrificing oneself to save others. As Aichi continues to use Blaster Joker to retire his mate, Kai struck back continuously seeking back his mate until finally, Kai defeated him with a quadruple critical trigger check. As the seed attempts to get to Kai, Kai calls on Blaster Blade who smashes the seed into tiny pieces that went into all fighters there as well as selected fighters across the world who possess forgiveness and understanding and small enough that it will not possess and take over its host. Thus with the threat over, the palace breaks down as Aichi and the others return to Earth with everyone's memories of Aichi restored. Before the palace completely disappears from his fading will, he and Kourin have their final conversation in the form of their astral bodies. Noticing that his card Photon fades away and realizing that Kourin's memories will fade away along with the card, he imparted his final farewell words to Kourin that he won't forget her no matter what happens. In episode 195, a year after the battle in the moon palace, Aichi was having problems in writing the graduation ceremony speech but was still glad that everything went well in school as the Cardfight Club has gotten some new freshmen members and it was revealed that they won the VF high school tournament. After a few fights at Hitsue and Fukuhara, the next day Aichi and Naoki were on to school when they met with Kai who was fighting some tough fighters while talking about the major Card Capital shop tournament. In episode 196, during the ceremony Aichi was called to deliver his speech, whereby after it was mentioned he did not say it well as he felt depressed over it. After the ceremony, they all went to Card Capital and participated in the tournament. They were surprised to meet up with AL4, Dreadnought, and Genius. Towards the end of the episode, Kai told Aichi he will be going to Europe and wouldn't be back for a while but Aichi assured him as long as they play the game they will meet up in time as they open up their vanguards.Neon Messiah  In the animated Vanguard Film, Aichi is the main Protagonist alongside Kai. He's back at Card Capital for the summer with team Q4, the Miyaji Cardfight Club, and a few more companions. While fighting against Kai, Aichi is transported suddenly to a chaotic Planet Cray consumed in flames, and Blaster Blade emerges to warn him about a mysterious threat to Cray, and the need to awaken a messiah to save them. Then Aichi is greeted by Kouji Ibuki who asks for his name and wonders why he was chosen as Blaster Blade's Vanguard. After telling Ibuki his name, Ibuki utters the word \"Disappear\" and strikes Aichi/Blaster Blade in the chest. Aichi then flashes back to reality and is questioned by Morikawa if he was spacing out in the middle of a fight. Aichi reveals that he's been having these Visions almost every day, where Blaster Blade asks him to awaken the messiah and warns him about Cray's impending doom. Eventually, he, along with team Q4, is invited to take part in the Messiah Scramble tournament to compete for ownership of a strange grade 4 \"Harmonics Messiah.\" He and Kai connect the visions and the tournament and realize that the Scramble is more than just a friendly competition. A second later they experience a small tremor and look out the window to see a glowing red planet hovering above them, confirming Kai's suspicions. At that moment Aichi receives a call from Misaki, who tells him to get to Card Capital fast. Upon arrival at the shop, Kai and Aichi see Team Asteroid surrounded by his friends with blank black cards scattered on the table in front of them. Ren goes over his fight with Kouji, revealing that he is the one responsible for the deletion of the cards all over the world, and warns Team Q4 about Ibuki and his \"Alien\" like deck. The next day, Aichi and Team Q4 take off on a private plane to be transported to the Scramble Tournament, with most of the Miyaji High School characters there to see them off. During the plane ride, Aichi and Team Q4 spend time talking about the messiah, and how the Scramble Tournament is one big mystery. Team Q4 finally arrives on the island, prepared to fight, but Aichi, seeing a temple up ahead, recognizes it from his visions. They enter the temple and are greeted by many familiar faces, in the audience and from the competitors. Soon, the tournament begins, but because of Ibuki's actions, a whole round of the tournament was cancelled, so Aichi must fight Ibuki in place of that round. The fight between Aichi and Ibuki begins with Aichi confronting Ibuki about his actions. He asks why Ibuki would be doing such a horrible thing to Vanguard, but all Ibuki says is that he's liberating people from the curse that is Vanguard. During the fight, Ibuki's Deletor units are revealed to the audience and Aichi. Aichi fights on with his Seekers (his boss card being Alfred EXIV), but is soon overpowered by Oksizz's unbelievable skill. Ibuki wins the match and prepares to Delete Alfred and the rest of the Paladins, but Blaster Blade sacrifices himself to save everyone else. Blaster Blade, standing in front of Aichi, asks with his dying breath to please save his home, Cray. Aichi receives the physical and emotional pain of Blaster Blade's death and is eliminated from the tournament. That night, Aichi wakes up determined to bring Blaster Blade back, claiming that he can feel Blaster Blade still alive. Suiko reveals to him the can in fact bring Blaster Blade from the brink of death, but he must fight in order to do so. Aichi, along with Naoki and Miwa, join Suiko to meet Takuto underneath the shrine. Takuto explains to Aichi that beating him at his strongest will activate the best of Aichi's PSY Qualia, strengthening Aichi's connection with Blaster Blade, and Undeleting him. Takuto also warns that the strain on Aichi's body may kill him, but Aichi proceeds anyway. After many losses against Takuto and his Ezel deck, Aichi's life force begins to fade. Then, the Royal Paladin units all begin to speak to him, thanking him for being their Vanguard and risking his life to protect them, and that they would now give all their power to win this fight and save Blaster Blade. They succeed, with Alfred/Aichi delivering the final blow. Aichi then meets Kai and Ibuki back in the coliseum, revealing that he's freed Blaster Blade and is ready to fight. Ibuki challenges them both at once and they enter a massive fight in order to save Earth and Cray. Aichi tries to talk to Ibuki and reach the person inside him that loved Vanguard. He tells Ibuki that going at it with all your might during a cardfight is what allows you to make friends with anyone, and that's why even with the fate of the world on the line, he's having a lot of fun. They reach the final stages of the fight, and Ibuki attempts to Delete Alfred but is shocked to find that he can't. Aichi begins to speak to the Messiah, who is glad that he finally hears her voice. Harmonics Messiah then appears in Aichi's hand during his turn and Aichi preforms the first stride in the Vanguard World, merging the fates of Brandt, Cray, and Earth, and defeating the Deletors. The last few minutes of the film show Aichi and Team Q4 talking to the real Ibuki as he heads off to find a new path. Aichi sees a new friend in Ibuki and gives him the Harmonics Messiah card. Upon Ibuki's touch, however, the Harmonics Messiah changes into Neon Messiah, the first Generation Break unit in the Vanguard World.G Season 1  In Turn 1, he was seen at the very end when Chrono Shindou was running past him. He stopped to look back to Chrono, and then continued to walk. He was shown as a shadow. In the next episode he was briefly seen on a message chat with Miwa and Kai on Kamui's phone when he was telling Chrono that he was asking a few friends about the mysterious clan.G Season 2  He was briefly seen again in Turn 1 looking at Ibuki's message regarding Plan G on his phone. It is assumed that he is studying abroad. He is seen again at Turn 22 with who seems to be Ratie Curti. He is again seen in the next episode watching the match between Tokoha Anjou and Misaki. He is also seen directly on the final episode, showing that he is helping Plan G (GIRS Crisis), with riding his avatar Blaster Blade, alongside with Ratie and his friends.G Season 3  In Turn 49 he was seen summoning his ace Blaster Blade along with his friends and traveled with them to help Chrono stop Ryuzu Myoujin's plan.G Season 4  In TURN 26 in NEXT, Aichi returns to Japan, to be greeted by his friends. He meets Chrono for the first time, knowing all about him thanks to Kamui. It was mentioned that he was attending an American University to study Cosmology and Astrophysics and learn the English language. While studying abroad, he continued to play vanguard at America. In TURN 27, he fights with Chrono with his new \"Saver\" Deck. At the end of the episode, he is the one who gives Chrono Interdimensional Dragon, Beyond Order Dragon.G Season 5  To be added.Relationships Toshiki Kai  His relationship with Kai, at first was rocky. They didn't get along too well though they learned to enjoy each other company. Kai is quite supportive of Aichi though only when Aichi learned how to do things by himself and become more confident. Aichi taught Kai how to have fun in Cardfight again when Kai forgotten how much fun he was having before his change in school and his parent's death. During Season Two, Kai was withdrawn from him since Aichi needed to learn how to do things by himself and to not count on others to help him. In Season Three, Kai noticed how much Aichi has changed. He was happy and sad at the same time though he was glad to see Aichi being himself now. However, this now puts him in a role reversal as, through observing Aichi and Ren's strength through their cardfight, he feels as though they have exceeded him by leaps and bounds. Tempted by the promise of strength, he willingly takes the power of Reverse and the Link Joker clan so he can face Aichi one on one as his equal. Aichi, realizing the danger of having such strength using a dark power, resolves to personally defeat him and release him from Reverse. In the end, he finally got through to Kai who tried to shut himself away from everyone. In Season 4, Kai seems more assured about preserving his bond with Aichi who he considers as his \"mate\", going through great lengths to bring Aichi back. \u00a0Misaki Tokura  She and Aichi have a close friendship. They shared one thing in common: they both didn't know how to play Cardfight at first. After going through countless tournaments together, they formed a tight bond with each other eventually becoming schoolmates in the same High School. She appears to have a slight liking to Aichi though Aichi never noticed it.Kamui Katsuragi  Their relationship is close and very supportive of each other. Kamui treated Aichi as a brother, and they had an inseparable bond. Although Kamui, at first, was treating Aichi with kindness to see if Emi would like him, but eventually Kamui learned to enjoy Aichi's company. They went through thick and thin together and eventually became an irreplaceable friend and teammate.Taishi Miwa  He and Aichi get along quite well. They speak a lot to each other when not Cardfighting and Miwa is very supportive of Aichi. He cares a lot for everyone and Aichi is one of them. He likes to lighten the mood when Aichi is down in the dumps.Kourin Tatsunagi  He and Kourin have an understanding relationship with each other. At first, she was annoyed at him though she learned to care about him after seeing what he was going through. Out of the three sisters, she cares for Aichi the most and seems to worry about him whenever he was in trouble. She helped him in many different situations and he was always glad for her help. It appears that her caring has turned into a slight crush on him. She, at times, shows some feelings for Aichi though he does not notice it. In season 4, their bond becomes stronger. Before the arrival of the Quatre Knights at the sanctuary, Kourin helped Aichi to control his dark powers. The card Companion Star Star-vader, Photon appears as Kourin's avatar. When Kourin lost to Naoki in episode 191, he woke up in time to save her from the miasma, commenting on how she had taken his suffering again. During his cardfight with Kai, even Kourin realized what Aichi was doing when he seeks mate, Photon to Legion with Blaster Joker, Aichi's corrupted avatar.Ren Suzugamori  His relationship with Ren was very distant the first time they met. He was a far better player than Aichi and Aichi felt a difference in strength. When Aichi was upset for causing his team failures, Ren took a chance and told him that power can be his if he chose the path, he took back then. When they fought in the last battle, Aichi told him that he will not use PSY Qualia anymore and showed Ren what it meant to have true strength. When they met again after some months, their relationship became rather close. They now enjoy each other companies and likes to talk to each other even though Ren tends to switch subjects or sleeping on his feet.Blaster Blade  His relationship to Blaster Blade is a special one. Although Blaster Blade was just a card to many people, Aichi has always counted on him to support him and always calls him his avatar. When Aichi was abusing PSY Qualia, he abandoned Blaster Blade for Blaster Dark though when they meet in Cray (an image of it), Blaster Blade told him that PSY Qualia was never his true strength. Aichi, once again, called him his avatar. When Blaster Blade was sealed away in Season Two, Aichi went through lots of trials to get him back. Blaster Blade told Aichi that he will always be with him. Even though Aichi chose to seal himself away to prevent the Link Joker invasion from happening again, Blaster Blade even went as far as entrusting to Kai his strength in order to save Aichi and Cray's future.Blaster Dark  His relationship with Blaster Dark is very loose. Although Aichi did use him instead of Blaster Blade, he in the end chose Blaster Blade over him. Blaster Dark told him that he will regret it later. When Aichi fought against Ren, he told Ren that both Blaster Blade and Blaster Dark are his avatars.Emi Sendou  Aichi cares a great deal for Emi, though their relationship is slightly reversed from that of normal siblings with Emi often taking care of him. He has shown to respect her and appreciate her for making him meals and supporting him. He was also the one who inspired her to take up Vanguard after seeing how the game changed him.Quatre Knights  Not much is known about his relationship to the Knights. However, he has faith in them and entrusts them his will in protecting the future. He has great trust in Gaillard, even admitting his fears and telling them how others have given him strength during their first meeting. He earned the respect of Neve through their first cardfight, even as far as Neve addressing him as 'Lord'. Before the time he was sealed, he even gave Ratie courage, helping her to find the true meaning of friendship and protecting the one precious to her. Later on in the series, they understood what Aichi meant during their initial time together, which later becomes their strength and a key to save the future. A year after the battle in the moon palace, the remaining knights still kept in contact with their former leader, signifying their undying bond with Aichi; and up today, Ratie still follows Aichi wherever he goes.Trivia List of Cardfight!! Vanguard Booster Sets Dark Irregulars  \"Dark Irregulars\" (\u30c0\u30fc\u30af\u30a4\u30ec\u30ae\u30e5\u30e9\u30fc\u30ba D\u0101ku Iregyur\u0101zu) is a clan from the nation of Dark Zone, and introduced in Booster Set 1: Descent of the King of Knights. In the lore, this nation is full of cryptids, demons, vampires, and other supernatural beings. There is no hierarchy, as the only way to have power in this clan is to gain it by murdering others, and being one of the strongest in the clan. The most notable group, though, are the followers of the demon marquis; high-ranking demons who bear the mark of the \"Evil Eye\", the insignia of the demon marquis himself. There seems to be different realms within the clan, as those from the land of nightmares seem to live in a world all of their own. Due to the power-hungry denizens residing in this clan, torture and experimentation are commonplace, resulting in such groups as those who wield the \"Wings of Destruction\". In the events of the Cardfight!! Vanguard G series, a scarlet vampire has been making himself known due to his insatiable bloodlust.Background  Who are the Dark Irregulars? This is a group of psychics residing in \"Dark Zone\", the nation of mysteries and magic. The members are people repelled by common senses, order and peer pressure of the world, such as exiles banished from their homelands due to possession of paranormal power and aberrantly-shaped beings who have undergone forbidden spell treatment and modification surgeries for their desire of strength. Despite being a lawless group, they share one and only one common value, that is, \"might makes right\". Though they compete for the domination of Dark Zone and their internal activities are filled with intrigues and schemes, other nations recognize them as a party of formidable military power.Playstyle  Their gameplay revolves around increasing the number of cards in their soul, and gaining advantages based on how large their soul is. As the number of cards in the soul is usually only important to the main bosses, while the rear-guards focus on getting cards into the soul, this playstyle can be seen as the followers \"collecting souls\" for their leader, which mimics the clan's lore. The power gained by obtaining cards into the soul is made greater due to the keyword \"Darkness\". The denizens from Nightmareland seem to have the only notable deviation from the clan in their effects, in which they require specific cards in the soul for their effects.Known/Notable Fighters Standard Fight Rules  Main rules about how to play Cardfight!! Vanguard.Winning/Losing Conditions Deck Construction Rules  As global rule: Continuous abilities regarding deck construction of your main deck or G deck, are applied as a replacement effect that changes the following rules. You may only have up to four cards with the same printed card name between your main deck and G deck each (even if anyone has different characteristics except its card name).Main Deck G Deck Fighter's Rules Reading the Card Layout  Currently, there are sixteen relevant properties that a card has concerning the gameplay. They can also be referred to as the \"original characteristics\" of the card.Zones of the Game  These are the zones where you and your opponent put their respective cards while fighting. The information of cards are public or hidden depending on the zone where they are in. When multiple cards move from a zone to another zone at the same time, the player must put them into that zone one by one.Details  These are additional rules to know in case of conflict with actions or effects that will resolve.Starting the Fight Turn Phases  Both players go through of each of these phases in this order during his/her respective turn, until a winner is declared. If an effect or condition skips any of these phases, effects and actions that are mandatories will not be performed.Stand Phase  During your stand phase, turn all of your units that are rest  (horizontal) to stand  (vertical) one by one, unless they are prevented from doing so by an ability. After resolving all effects, proceed to the draw phase.Draw Phase  The draw phase takes two steps, which must be done in this order, and only once each turn.1. Draw Step  Take the first card from the top of your deck, and put it into your hand without revealing it. This is known as \"draw a card\".2. G Assist Step  Main article: G Assist.Ride Phase  The ride phase takes two steps, which must be done in this order, and only once each turn.1. Ride Step  You may normal ride only once in this step. Choose a card from your hand that is one grade greater than or equal to your current vanguard, and ride it. Your chosen unit is always ridden in [Stand] by default. Either you rode or not, after resolving all effects, proceed to the stride step.2. Stride Step  Main articles: Stride, Ultimate StrideMain Phase  During the main phase, you prepare for the battle by playing units and using abilities. In any order, you may: Once you are ready to attack, proceed to the battle phase by declaring it.Battle Phase  During your battle phase, you may attack with your standing units in the front row against your opponent's units. It takes five steps, which must be done in this order, and only once each turn. A battle is considered a battle from the moment it begins. Even if the process of the battle is cut off midway, or even if any of the units in the battle leaves the field, and proceeds to the close step, it still counts as a battle.1. Start Step  Start step is where you choose whether to attack or not. If you choose not to attack, or you cannot attack, proceed directly to the end phase, and none battle has been performed as a result. If you have chosen to attack, proceed to the attack step, and you cannot return back.2. Attack Step  Attack step is where you may choose with which unit attack first. If there are no effects being used at this moment, choose one of your standing  units in the front row as the attacking unit for this battle, then rest  it (or rest both Legion Leader and Mate in such case). After choosing, choose one of your opponent's units in the front row other than a Legion Mate, which will become the unit being attacked. The state of \"attacking unit\" and \"unit being attacked\" only remains as long as those units continue present on their respective circles, until end of this battle. For the attacking unit, the unit attacked becomes its \"battle opponent\", and at the same time, for the unit that is being attacked, the attacking unit becomes its \"battle opponent\". After choosing the unit to be attacked, you may choose one of your units with boost icon  on it from your back row in the same column as the attacking unit, and rest it to make it boost the attacking unit (if it is a vanguard that is Legion, it will boost one of the attacking units under your choice). From this moment, the unit chosen becomes a \"boosting unit\" and the attacking unit becomes a \"boosted unit\" by that unit. The state of \"boosting unit\" and \"boosted unit\" only remains as long as both units continue present in their respective circles, until end of this battle. Until end of the close step, while the boosting unit is in its original circle, its power value will continuously be added to the power of the boosted unit (even if its power is increased during the battle due to an effect). Finally, resolve all abilities that were activated in any order, then proceed to the guard step. The real battle begins here.3. Guard Step  Guard step is where your opponent may use guardians to prevent the attack hit. This is performed after resolving any ability, and in any order as he or she wishes: Each time your opponent calls a new unit to (GC) or moves a new unit to (GC) during this battle, he or she chooses which unit it will guard among the units that are being attacked. Then, they resolve all abilities that were activated before calling a new guardian or intercept. Your opponent may continue calling or intercepting guardians, as many times as possible. While the guardian units are in the guardian circle, the power of the attacked unit that was chosen, is increased by the total shield of units guarding it (if there is a unit without a printed shield, its original value will be regarded as 0 shield). After resolving all abilities, if you opponent has finished calling guardians or intercepting, proceed to your drive step. If your opponent chose not to call or intercept guardians against the attack in this step (\"I don't guard\" for example), proceed to your drive step.4. Drive Step  If the attacking unit is a vanguard, you check for additional effects during the attack, known as \"drive check\". \"Drive\" is referred as the amount of drive checks that your vanguard is able to peform in this step. If you need to perform multiple drive checks, check for it one by one, and resolve it one by one. To drive check, put the top card of your deck into your trigger zone face up. If that card has the same clan as a unit on your vanguard or rear-guard circle, resolve all effects indicated by the trigger icon on the card, in any order you like. After resolving all effects, if the card is still in the trigger zone, put that card into your hand, regardless of whether it has a trigger icon or not. Then, repeat this process as many times as your vanguard's drive (or Legion Leader in such case). After completing all actions during the drive check, proceed to the damage step. The battle arrives to its climax here.5. Damage Step  Damage step is to confirm whether the attack to the \"unit being attacked\" will hit, as well as the damage to be dealt. Compare the actual power of the attacking unit with the actual power of the attacked unit, and if the attacked unit's power is less than or equal to the attacking unit, then the attack hits. If the attacking unit or the attacked unit leaves the field, or if the master of any of these units is changed, or if any of these units is moved to another circle, then the powers are not compared, and the attack does not hit. If the attack hits, one of two situations occurs, depending on the unit who was hit. Also, retire all the guardians other than G guardianss that were guarding that unit, and all G guardians that were guarding that unit are put into the owner's G zone face up. If your opponent's vanguard is dealt damage by the attack, your opponent checks for additional effects, known as \"damage check\". \"Damage\" is referred to as the amount of damage checks that the vanguard who dealt damage is able to perform, either during the damage check or a card's effect. If the player need to perform multiple damage checks, he or she checks for it one by one, and resolves it one by one. To damage check, he or she puts the top card of his or her deck into his or her trigger zone face up. If that card has the same clan as a unit on his or her vanguard or rear-guard circle, then resolves all effects indicated by the trigger icon on the card, in any order he or she likes. After resolving all effects, if the card is still in the trigger zone, he or she puts that card into his or her damage zone face up, regardless of whether it has a trigger icon or not. Then, your opponent repeats this process as many times as the amount of damage dealt to his or her vanguard. If your opponent has 6 or more cards in his or her damage zone as a result, you win the game. After completing all actions during the damage check, proceed to the close step.6. Close Step  Close step is where all effects that happen at the end of a battle, or at the beginning of close step, are activated. After resolving all effects, the battle arrived to its end. Attacking units are no longer \"attacking units\", and attacked units are no longer \"attacked units\". After this, return back to your start step to continue attacking with your standing units. In that step, you choose whether to attack or not again. If you choose not to attack during your next start step, proceed to the end phase, and the battle phase has ended.End Phase  End phase is where all actions and effects are activated and resolved at the end of a turn. The following actions take place before any ability, and the turn player then perform them in the following order: After resolving these actions, abilities with \"when card is unlocked\", \"when card is put face up\" and \"when card is put into the G zone\" are activated, and resolved in any order. Then, abilities with \"at the beginning of end phase\" and \"at the end of turn\" are activated, and resolved in any order. Then, effects with \"until end of turn\" cease to exist. At this point, if there is no longer further abilities nor actions to resolve, declare the end of your turn, then your opponent's next turn starts, beginning with his or her stand phase. If an effect allows you to get an \"Extra Turn\", your opponent cannot declare the beginning of what would be their next turn.Comprehensive Rules  The \"Comprehensive Rules\" is the official manual designed to explain and detail all the game rules and mechanics. While it explains everything in general, some unmentioned details can be found in the rulings of the card you need instead.Oracle Think Tank  \"Oracle Think Tank\" (\u30aa\u30e9\u30af\u30eb\u30b7\u30f3\u30af\u30bf\u30f3\u30af Orakuru Shinku Tanku) is a clan from the nation of United Sanctuary. In the manga, the clan has been referred to as \"\" (literally \"Divination Magical Team\"). In the lore, the clan is led by CEO Amaterasu. As the clan itself is a corporation, the offer many different services, with the main business being in predictive magicks and fortune telling. They also have an offensive troupe that specializes as a police force, and magick users that focus on collecting and organizing information. Many gods and goddesses are also considered to be celebrities, such as the avatar of the moon. In the events of the Cardfight!! Vanguard G series, the rebellious younger brother of the CEO travels the world, looking to test his strength, after having a world-changing premonition, later becoming a VIP of the holy nation.Backgrounds  What is Oracle Think Tank? It is a conglomerate which carries out counselling and economic forecast, using magical and scientific prediction methods such as prophecy magic, clairvoyance and fortune-telling. It is an information major, able to respond to requests from many niches, including even love divination and prediction of gambling results. It is centered around fortune tellers and spellcasters of humans and fairies. What is Oracle Think Tank? (Card of the Day, April 21st 2016) It is a conglomerate which carries out counselling and economic forecast, using magical and scientific prediction methods such as prophecy magic, clairvoyance and fortune-telling. It is involved in all kinds of business related to information, ranging from love divination and great scale divination of the fate of nations. In order to counter industrial spies that try to steal their information, they pay efforts in training agents responsible for combat and security. With that know-how, it supports the nations from the rear, carrying out tasks like development of new armament for knightly orders and dispatching security guards and witch corps.Playstyle  Oracle Think Tank's main focus is increasing the player's hand size in order to keep guarding the opponent's assaults until they run out of resources. They also manipulate the deck to some extent to have more control over which cards they draw and know when they'll Drive Check Triggers. Their keyword is Oracle, which activates when the player has 5 or more cards in hand. The clan relies less on brute force than other clans. Instead, they apply pressure by Drive Checking more triggers and restricting the opponent from guarding with Grade 0 cards. Tsukuyomi relies on checking the top five cards of the Deck then returning them to the bottom in any order, by doing this enough times and never shuffling, the player can eventually stack the entire deck. The Witches focus on having one or less cards in the soul. The Magus focus on guessing what's the top card of the deck, which they do by looking at it beforehand. The Battle Sisters draw power from their rear-guards and use a large amount of on-hit effects. Susanoo looks at the top two cards of the deck and decides which to add to their hand and send the other to the bottom of the deck to improve the quality of their draws.Known/Notable Fighters Trivia Shadow Paladin  \"Shadow Paladin\" (\u30b7\u30e3\u30c9\u30a6\u30d1\u30e9\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3 Shad\u014d Paradin) is a clan from the United Sanctuary nation, introduced in Booster Set 4: Eclipse of Illusionary Shadows. In the lore, the leader of this clan is Blaster Dark \"Diablo\". This clan is one of the three armies defending the holy nation. Due to their preference of working in the shadows, without seeking glory or recognition, many do not know of this clan, and the clan's name falls in and out of obscurity from time to time. Despite being a part of the holy nation, they sometimes start conflict within the nation, and have been known to start at least two civil wars. The clan's main fighting force are the warriors in black who once helped to repel the invaders. There are also three main branches of magic, specifically \"Ogreshift\", \"Dragshift\", and black magic. This clan also contains many mobile strongholds used for various purposes such as housing studies for mages, or being used as gates and fortifications. In the events of the Cardfight!! Vanguard G series, a black dragon with a blood-red sword sought rebellion against the Grandmaster, and ultimately failed. A young yet prodigal mage travels Planet Cray in search of ancient texts dealing with dragons, while also seeking revenge against the one who killed his brother.Background  Who are the Shadow Paladins? (Card of the Day 25th February 2015) The holy nation United Sanctuary has overcome many tragedies and difficulties in its history. In the shade of its history, there is a knightly order which never comes to the front stage. The black knights hide in the darkness, stealth in the darkness, and persevere in performing their tasks indifferently like shadows---it is not clear if they exist nowadays. However, they were there, as the legendary shadow of the radiant light. Shadow Paladin after Invasion Great War (Card of the Day 25th March 2015) After defeating \"Link Joker\", the invaders that pose a threat to planet Cray during the \"Invasion Great War\", \"Mordred\" passed back the title of Grandmaster of Shadow Paladin to \"Blaster Dark\". With the faith and determination to sustain the holy nation beneath the shadow, Blaster Dark fought silently without seeking praise. His form inspires his subordinates as the mental fulcrum of Shadow Paladin. There are, however, people who don't feel comfortable about Blaster Dark's status. As Blaster Dark uses no words but actions to display his aspirations, misunderstandings and animosities grow in Shadow Paladin from time to time. Conspirators with nefarious ambitions arise and collude, in order to overthrow Blaster Dark and become the new grandmaster. All usurpers who proceed to attack Blaster Dark are easily defeated by their target himself. Yet, the belief of martial leadership is spreading obscurely among the Shadow Paladins. One wonders whether Charon, the advisor of Blaster Dark, notices the situation... The Legend of Shadow Paladin (Card of the Day 30th March 2015) \"Blaster Dark\", the Grandmaster of Shadow Paladin after the Invasion Great War, has companions who have fought alongside him for a long time. There is Macha the tactician, commanding the troops at the frontier with her sword in her hand, just like Blaster Dark himself. There is Mac Lir, the leader of the Defense Troop that shelters the soldiers on the front line. There are Dorint and Claudas, the twin knights, who unleash their strength for the purpose of Blaster Dark. The angel girl and high owl dance on the battlefield, and bestow power to warriors. The black high dog gallops on the land, and charges forward with Blaster Dark. Standing behind the warriors are Badhadh Caar the great mage, Charon the sage and Nemain the witch, protecting the rear of the knights. The strife of these \"heroes\" can only be found among the legends, with no official records. Their current whereabouts are, again, hidden in the darkness and unknown to anyone. Shadow Paladin in Modern Times (Monthly Bushiroad 2015 May Issue) \"Shadow Paladin\", the knightly order of shadow, leaves no name on historical texts, but the details of their existences are recorded in the notes of the King and the memo of a famous sage. However, they have disappeared even from the back stage in modern times, to an extent that their very existence has been doubted. As a result, villains arose frequently in the United Sanctuary where the suppressing force behind the scene was lost. The disappeared knightly order of shadow, the frequent incidents---the simultaneously occurred phenomena caused the inspection team members of the capital came to a hypothesis, that Shadow Paladin was the culprit. In addition, a mysterious monstrosity known as \"Black Dragon\" showed up. With the interference from \"Gear Chronicle\", the current situation of Shadow Paladin is being made clear. The Movement of Shadow Paladin (Monthly Bushiroad 2015 July Issue) Now, the knightly order has been divided into two groups. Those who follow the original Grandmaster, and those who are led by the opposing \"Claret Sword Dragon\"---generally known as the \"Divided Clique\". Claret Sword Dragon has gained greater power to speak as time flows, and has persuaded those whose dissatisfaction against the style of the knightly order leaked from mouths to follow him. Gradually he assembled subordinates loyal to him. As he judged he has accumulated enough power, he proclaimed himself the Grandmaster of \"Shadow Paladin\", and declared rebellion openly. To claim the nation his own, he triggered the revolt sternly. The Fusion of Forbidden Spells and the Techniques that Surpasses Time (Monthly Bushiroad 2015 July Issue) It is impossible to analyze the details of technologies of \"Gear Chronicle\". However, as one briefly figure out \"where to work on\", \"what to be done\" and \"what are the results\", the technologies can be utilized without knowing the tricks. By combining the unknown technologies and forbidden spells with the secret sacrifice of multiple members of the knightly order, \"Claret Sword Dragon\" developed new forbidden spells. The dark arts, commonly known as \"Forbidden Spells of Reinforcement\", can respond to the negative emotions of the spellcasters and extract great power of darkness from another spacetime. Nonetheless, the power could disrupt the energy balance between spacetimes, and lead to exacerbation of Interdimensional Crosstalk. Chaos of the Holy Nation, Trap of the Black Dragon, and... (Monthly Bushiroad 2015 September Issue) Long time has passed since the end of the Great Wars. No grave battle has occurred, and the invasions from the neighbouring nation and the pirates are nothing more than checks and balances, as a way of expressing their own power. Not only civilians indulge in peace, but also the knights, deities and sages of the capital... United Sanctuary, the holy nation who has let down its guard, is now exposed to the threat of subversion, triggered by the declaration of war from \"Claret Sword Dragon\", the Grandmaster of \"Shadow Paladin\". To make things worse, \"Fenrir\", a deity of \"Genesis\", has committed treason with his partakers, and \"Black Gravers\" of \"Angel Feather\", led by \"Gavrail\", were forced to surrender as the hospital and patients were taken hostage. The nation, losing a great portion of its forces, turned to summon back the garrison troops of other cities and expedition troops, and asked for help from other friendly nations. However, it is perhaps an adverse effect brought by the long peace, that they couldn't look through the truth that all their actions had been predicted in Claret Sword Dragon's scheme. And, the Black Dragon couldn't foresee, that the mightiest warrior of \"Gear Chronicle\" has released its power from restraints to break this desperate situation. Liberation War and the Knightly Order of Shadow (Card of the Day 4th February 2016) Liberation War---that is a great war when the brave knight \"Ezel\"'s heroic saga was carved into the history. However, only few knows the truth of the war now. During the great war which triggered the establishment of the kingdom's Second Regular Army \"Gold Paladin\", the kingdom's regular army and the knightly order of shadow joined hands to save the sealed heroes. The regular army \"Royal Paladin\" fought to liberate the sealed hero of light. And, \"Shadow Paladin\" fought to liberate the hero of darkness. The two knightly orders, once had exchanged blades and fought hard to annihilate each other, carried the same aspiration and title of the golden knightly order, \"Gold Paladin\". ---After the war, under the command of the King of Knights of that time, \"Gold Paladin\" was organized into the kingdom's Second Regular Army. However, the shadowy knights left no name on the history, and disappeared into the kingdom's darkness again. The legend of the \"Black Steed Corps\", is only known by few knights. And so is the whereabouts of the \"Dragon Whelp\" who leads the black knights... The Forgotten Legend of the Black Steed Knight There is a mysterious legend in \"Shadow Paladin\", none knows from when and from where it is told. That is, the \"Black Steed Knight\", the saviour of the shadowy knights, has been revived. When \"Vortimer\" just disappeared, there were many members who knew his existence and waited for his revival. However, few people know him now. By the way, the name of Vortimer can be found in a book published by a great sage of the holy knightly order. However, the book is over thousand pages, and his name only appears a few times. It is not really wrong to say none in the Regular Armies know his existence.Playstyle  Shadow Paladin's theme is \"sacrifice your allies for power\". It focuses on calling rear-guards from the deck, but unlike Royal Paladin who gains power from rear-guards, Shadow Paladin retires their rear-guards for costs or effects. It uses superior calling and building hand advantage to recover from the losses of retiring many rear-guards at once. This allows the clan to have a highly aggresive game while still keeping enough resources to defend and has strong consistency via multiple Superior calls similar to Royal Paladin. As of Cardfight!! Vanguard G, Shadow Paladin now focuses on calling grade 1 cards in contrast to Royal Paladin calling grade 2 cards, and also introduces rear-guards whose effects activate when retired similar to Tachikaze, but differ in that they only activate when retired for your cost or effect. This trait of calling Grade 1 is most most prominent with Claret Sword Dragon. The keyword \"Ritual\" activates based on the number of grade 1 cards in your drop zone, and is mostly used by Dragwizards. This is fulfilled with the clan's usual playstyle of sacrifice. In contrast to the rest of the clan, the \"black witches\" focus on weakening the opponent by replacing the opponent's rear-guards with grade 0 to mess with their attack formations and strategies and also reduce the opponent's vanguard's power based on how many grade 0 rear-guards they have. They still retire as a cost.Known/Notable Fighters Trivia Nova Grappler  The Nova Grappler (\u30ce\u30f4\u30a1\u30b0\u30e9\u30c3\u30d7\u30e9\u30fc Nova Gurappur\u0101) is a clan from the nation of Star Gate. First introduced in Booster Set 1: Descent of the King of Knights. Lore-wise, the Nova Grapplers are a participant in the \"Nova Grapple\", a fully free fighting sport. Kamui Katsuragi uses this clan in both the\u00a0anime and manga.\u00a0Nagisa Daimonji\u00a0also uses this clan in the anime.Background  What is Nova Grappler? Pro fighters have gathered from around the globe to participate in this event. As all weapons, spells, and modifications are allowed, no one is really sure whether this is a no-holds-barred competition or a battlefield anymore. Most of the participants are machines, but there are other types of participants as well. The Nova Grapple is also one of Star Gate's main sources of tourism. Extreme Battlers and Exxtreme Battlers Recently, the number of young kid fans of Nova Grapple is increasing drastically. To amuse these adorable guests, a certain team develops series of robos---the \"Extreme Battlers\" and the reinforced \"Exxtreme Battlers\". The heroically fighting \"Exxtreme Battlers\" win popularity among both adults and kids, while the \"Extreme Battlers\", who have comical looks and fight merrily, attract the eyesight of younger children. What is Nova Grappler? (Card of the Day 20th April 2016) It is a group of pro fighters with global popularity. Their activities have become a great source of tourism income of \"Star Gate\". Nova Grapple accepts participants from all races, and all weapons, spells, and modifications are allowed. Although many participants are machines, but there are also superhumans who can fight with machines equally, and aliens from other planets. Their fights go beyond the common senses of ordinary combat sports. Their fights are not limited to ground, and seas and the space are also their rings to be fought on mobile weapons.Playstyle  Nova Grappler fully focuses on Standing for a successive attack, and gains more power form Stand. Many of their cards can Stand after an attack, and some wil gain more power. Their Keyword Rush, which activates when they [Stand] due to an effect or Trigger, is a symbol to this playstyle. The Death Army and Asura Kaisers focuses on Dive Check and reveal a grade 3 so they would [Stand] themselves and little bit of other cards. The Beast Deity also focuses on Drive Check, this one requiring any grade 1 or greater among them.Known/Notable Cardfighters Pale Moon  \"Pale Moon\" (\u30da\u30a4\u30eb\u30e0\u30fc\u30f3 Peiru M\u016bn, sometimes written as  in flavor texts) is a circus-themed clan from the nation of Dark Zone, and introduced in Booster Set 3: Demonic Lord Invasion. This clan focuses on calling units from the soul. For that, there is a number of effects that allow Soul Charge, and some of them allow a specific option of cards from the deck. Then, G Trial Deck 7 added the keyword \"Magia\", which allows to call units from the soul with added bonuses and/or lower costs in exchange of returning them to the soul at the end of turn. This clan is primarily used by Asaka Narumi and Kiriya Bidou from the anime, as well as Luna Yumizuki in Cardfight!! Vanguard G: GIRS Crisis.Backgrounds  What is Pale Moon? Pale Moon is a magical circus of which headquarter is located in \"Dark Zone\", the nation of mysteries and magic. They give touring shows all over the world, and win popularity with extraordinarily high level of performing skills and performances of magic. Nevertheless, behind the scene, they are merciless assassins. The magic and psychic powers, and the dangerous weapons and beasts, are not only decorations on the stage, but tools to wipe out intruders who dare to grope for the secrets of Dark Zone like magic tricks. The Reality of \"Pale Moon\", the Magical Circus with the Longest History in Cray The best trick-performing group of planet Cray---the magical circus \"Pale Moon\". A veteran elf of the group claimed that \"we have histories beyond millenia\", but since \"Dark Zone\" had little interest in the past, there was no official record to prove the claim. According to spoken lores, \"Pale Moon\" started as a mere assassination group, and the business of circus was nothing more than its cover, only performed stealthily. Nonetheless, as the group traveled around the world for assassinating important people, their popularity has grown gradually, and has become \"the best circus of Cray\". Thousands of years have passed, and now they pay more attention to the circus business, and members had changed a lot. That said, the assassination business has not been abolished completely, and there are two different kinds of teams. Some teams focusing on performances, like the \"Silver Thorn\" led by the Millenium Elf \"Luquier\", while others focus on assassination, of which members have combat-specialised psychic abilities. Now, \"Pale Moon\" is more seen on the public stage and display brilliant performances. The group is shrouded in many mysteries, and their combat strength is the most concerned part. The ostensible records of their battles are deleted by someone, and their full combat strength is a total unknown. One theory states that the members of \"Pale Moon\" are scattered in all places of Cray, and rumours tell that they can destroy a nation from within if they have the intention.Playstyle  Pale Moon's playstyle primarily focuses on calling rear-guards from the soul.Known/Notable Fighters Trivia Booster Set 4: Eclipse of Illusionary Shadows  Eclipse of Illusionary Shadows is the 4th Booster Set released in the Japanese/Korean format, and the 6th released in the English format.Contents Illustrators  \u4f0a\u85e4\u5f70\uff0fAzusa\uff0fDaisuke Izuka\uff0ffunbolt\uff0fhippo\uff0fHirokorin\uff0fKEI\uff0fkoji\uff0fKou Takano\uff0fMorechand\uff0fNINNIN\uff0fRyo-ta.H\uff0fTHORES\u67f4\u672c\uff0fToMo\uff0ftouge666\uff0fZB\uff0f\u5b89\u9054\u6d0b\u4ecb\uff0f\u96e8\u5bae\u6176\u592a\uff0f\u4f0a\u54b2\u30a6\u30bf\uff0f\u77f3\u7530\u30d0\u30eb\uff0f\u30a4\u30c8\u30a6\u30e8\u30a6\u30a4\u30c1\uff0f\u53f6\u4e4b\u660e\uff0f\u6728\u4e0b\u52c7\u6a39\uff0f\u5f37\u5316\u65b0\u578byutori\uff0f\u30b3\u30ac\u30e9\u30c4\uff0f\u9f4b\u85e4\u30bf\u30f6\u30aa\uff0f\u9f4b\u85e4\u76f4\u8475\uff0f\u30b9\u30ba\u30ad\u30b4\u30ed\u30a6\uff0f\u30bf\u30a4\u30ad\uff0f\u30bf\u30ab\u30e4\u30de\u30c8\u30b7\u30a2\u30ad\uff0f\u7530\u6240\u54f2\u5e73\uff0f\u8336\u58f1\uff0f\u5929\u795e\u82f1\u8cb4\uff0f\u306a\u304b\u3056\u304d\u51ac\uff0f\u897f\u6751\u30ad\u30cc\uff0f\u8429\u8c37\u85ab\uff0f\u96bc\u512a\u7d00?\uff0f\u524d\u6cb3\u60a0\u4e00\uff0f\u524d\u7530\u30d2\u30ed\u30e6\u30ad\uff0f\u5897\u7530\u5e79\u751f\uff0f\u4e38\u5c71\u6d69\uff0f\u78a7\u98a8\u7fbd\uff0f\u4e09\u597d\u8f09\u514b\uff0f\u6751\u702c\u502b\u592a\u90ce\uff0f\u7791\u4e38\u30a4\u30cc\u30c1\u30e8\uff0f\u767e\u702c\u5bff\uff0f\u68ee\u30c1\u30e3\u30c3\u30af\uff0f\u5c71\u5d0e\u592a\u90ce\uff0f\u7531\u5229\u771f\u73e0\u90ce\uff0f\u7c73\u8c37\u5c1a\u5c55\uff0f\u7adc\u5fb9Card List Additional cards  In the English version of this set, the following cards (which were promo cards in the Japanese version) were added:Aqua Force  \"Aqua Force\" (\u30a2\u30af\u30a2\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30b9 Akuaf\u014dsu) is a clan from the nation of Magallanica, and introduced in Trial Deck 7: Descendants of the Marine Emperor. This clan is based off of naval armed forces, and uses ranks in many of the card's titles. In the lore, the leader of this clan is Blue Storm Dragon, Maelstrom, who brought the clan into the present times from obscurity after being sealed away in ancient times. Similar to the militaries from the holy nation, each high-ranking officer has their own troop, such as the Ripples under the command of Genovious, the dual-troop Blue Waves lead by Tetra-drive and Anger-boil, the blue dragon's elite forces, the mesmerizing-yet-lethal special ops mermaid troop, and the all-terrain troop of the blue flight dragon. The clan is constantly at war against the undead pirates. In the events of the Cardfight!! Vanguard G series, a beloved troop captain rises through the ranks, impressing the blue dragon. As of Cardfight!! Vanguard G: Z, the first Admiral, Valeos, has been freed from his seal for his affliation with Dragon Deity of Destruction, Gyze. As a response to this new threat, Thavas is promoted to Vice-Admiral, and with Maelstrom's support, moves to directly combat Valeos and the revived Blue Wave Troops.Background  Aqua Force of Present Times (Card of the Day 25th December 2014) Aqua Force of the present Cray focused on the patrol, administration and conservation of marine environments, as well as the suppression of pirate activities and riots on shorelines. Though there isn't any war great enough to threaten Cray, they never ignore daily training so as to prepare themselves for any accidents. They know that disasters, be them natural or man-made ones, are possible to occur at any moment. Commander Max, of the force lead by Rear Admiral Thavas, was patrolling the ocean. There were ignorable incidents such as the capturing of a suspicious duo, but the ocean was otherwise calm. However, just after that, they would be forced to witness a \"natural disaster\" that could outshine even the strongest storm...Playstyles  The theme of this clan's playstyle is \"promotion, demotion, and tactical movements\", similar to that of a real world military. Many of their skills activate after a certain number of battles have occurred during that turn, and some can even activate during the opponent's turn with the clan's keyword \"Wave\". In general, the more the stated number require, the stronger the effect. To achieve multiple battles per turn, many units have the ability to re-stand after attack, exchange positions with other rear guards (allowing the player to not be hindered by having grade 2 or greater units in the backrow) or directly attack from the backrow. Usually, the skills of the vanguards themselves require them to participate in at least the third battle of that turn. Blue Storm, The elite forces of the blue dragon have a focus on the blue dragon himself, either by gaining more copies of him from the deck to the hand, or adding guard restrictions to his attacks to deal heavy damage. The Blue Wave troops instead relies on their vanguard to grant them more attacks by restanding units, including the vanguard itself, while gaining small power boosts after restanding. This troop also focuses on the \"Wave\" keyword. Those following the aspirations of Genovious base their attacks on the number of rested units rather than the number of battles that turn. They also have the ability to superior call and superior ride their units. Thavas' troop is a \"jack-of-all-trades\", with Thavas himself focusing on retiring the opponent's rear-guards, while his support gains power and has the ability to draw as well. He also makes use of \"Wave\", as well as the keyword \"Resist\".Known/Notable Fighters Design Concept  This clan is based off of naval armed forces, which is apparent in their designs and playstyles. Like other militaries in the Planet Cray, their designs have a futuristic aspect to them. Most of their titles follow naval rankings, although the hierarchy differs slightly than that of real-world rankings, and their standard uniforms more closely resemble real-world ceremonial uniforms that are reserved for special occasions. Their own names have Mediterranean-style origins (specifically Greek), such as Thundering Ripple, Genovious, while some are named after famous philosophers, such as Marine General of Heavenly Silk, Aristotle. The non-humanoids also take names from different types or forms of water and its phenomena, such as Blue Storm Dragon, Maelstrom and Blue Storm Deterrence Dragon, Ice Barrier Dragon. The clan's inhabitants consist of aquatic beings, such as Mermaids, aquatic mammals, fish, and aquatic avians, synthetic humanoids known as Aquaroids (some of which ride seahorses or dragons as mounts, known as \"Kelpie Riders\" and \"Jockeys\"), titans whose power comes from the mineral \"pyroxene\", and blue dragons. Due to the Greek naming style, and the fact that this clan was removed from Planet Cray's history and brought back, this clan is likely also based off of the mythological island Atlantis.Trivia Narukami  \"Narukami\" (\u306a\u308b\u304b\u307f Narukami) is a clan from the nation of Dragon Empire, and introduced in Trial Deck 6: Resonance of Thunder Dragon alongside Gold Paladin. In the lore, the clan's military prowess is second only to Kagero. After the Kagero clan was sealed away in the events leading to the War of Liberation, Narukami was created by the remaining members of the Kagero clan. Although many have crimson scales, their power comes from thunder and lightning. Each troop wields the lightning differently, such as the Eradicators who strike down their opponents, the Brawlers whose explosive martial arts can attack multiple foes at once, or those who bind their foes to incapacitate them. Their main infantry units are master lancers whose strikes mimic lightning strikes. In the events of the Cardfight!! Vanguard G series, a scarlet dragon commander seeks to protect the Planet Cray, all the while inspiring others to be strong for the future.Playstyle  Naturally, Narukami's play style is reminiscent of its predecessor's. All of the units focus on retiring the opponent's rear-guards, from actual retiring (such as the Eradicators), or gaining the ability to attack multiple units at once, causing the opponent to guard each unit individually or lose those who remain unguarded (such as the Brawlers and Kaisers). Also, the clan's purpose of retiring is for pure, extreme offense in contrast Kagero's pressure-based and sabotaging style. The clan also retire its own rearguard, usually with total destruction along with the opponent's. To differentiate from Kagero further, Narukami gained the ability to bind units starting in Cardfight!! Vanguard G. Some units can retire an opponent's rear-guard, and then bind said card once it enters the Drop Zone, while some cards can bind a card directly from the Drop Zone. The cards are bound face up, permanently, thus fueling the clan's keyword \"Thunderstrike\", which allows units to gain power and effects depending on the number of cards in the opponent's Bind Zone.Known/Notable Fighters Design Concept  This clan is based on lightning and dragons, which is apparent in their designs and playstyles. As a clan of the Dragon Empire, most of the units here are dragons, although there are some humanoids with an affinity to lightning. There is no specific naming theme to this clan, as many unit's names and titles take inspiration from the Middle East, eastern Asia, and southern Asia. These influences are slightly more apparent in the designs themselves rather than the names, as many units wear clothing that is more suited towards desert and arid regions, such as Desert Gunner, Shiden, and many units featuring these regions in their art's background, like in Malevolent Djinn's art, while the title \"Dragoon\" takes a more fantasy approach than that of its western European origins. Some units take after Hindu mythology as well, such as Avatar of Heroic Spirits, Vishnu. However, during Cardfight!! Vanguard: Season 4, the clan started taking a martial arts theme for its units. The inhabitants of this clan are humanoids and reptilians with an affinity to lightning, as well as Demons known as Djinns, and a few rodents.Trivia Booster Set 6: Breaker of Limits  \"Breaker of Limits\" is the 6th Booster Set\u00a0released in the Japanese/Korean format, and the 3rd released in the English format.Contents Illustrators  Eel\uff0fEin\uff0ffunbolt\uff0fHirokorin\uff0fMorechand\uff0fNAKAGAWA\uff0fNINNIN\uff0fSTS\uff0ftanu\uff0fToMo\uff0ftouge666\uff0funi\uff0fZB\uff0f\u9ebb\u5bae\u9a0e\u4e9c\uff0f\u3042\u3089\u3044\u305a\u307f\u308b\u3044\uff0f\u4f0a\u54b2\u30a6\u30bf\uff0f\u77f3\u7530\u30d0\u30eb\uff0f\u4f0a\u85e4\u5f70\uff0f\u30a4\u30c8\u30a6\u30e8\u30a6\u30a4\u30c1\uff0f\u4e0a\u7530\u5922\u4eba\uff0f\u3048\u3073\u3089\uff0f\u53f6\u4e4b\u660e\uff0f\u304b\u308f\u3059\u307f\uff0f\u559c\u4e45\u5c4b\u3081\u304c\u306d\uff0f\u6728\u4e0b\u52c7\u6a39\uff0f\u8349\u5f45\u7422\u4ec1\uff0f\u8336\u58f1\uff0f\u9f4b\u85e4\u30bf\u30f6\u30aa\uff0f\u971c\u6708\u3048\u3044\u3068\uff0f\u30b9\u30ba\u30ad\u30b4\u30ed\u30a6\uff0f\u4ed9\u7530\u8061\uff0f\u30bf\u30a4\u30ad\uff0f\u30bf\u30ab\u30e4\u30de\u30c8\u30b7\u30a2\u30ad\uff0f\u305f\u306b\u3081\u305d\uff0f\u7530\u6240\u54f2\u5e73\uff0f\u3066\u308b\u307f\u3043\uff0f\u6771\u57ce\u548c\u7f8e\uff0f\u306a\u304b\u3056\u304d\u51ac\uff0f\u897f\u91ce\u5e78\u6cbb\uff0f\u8429\u8c37\u85ab\uff0f\u30d1\u30c8\u30ea\u30b7\u30a2\uff0f\u524d\u6cb3\u60a0\u4e00\uff0f\u524d\u7530\u30d2\u30ed\u30e6\u30ad\uff0f\u96c5\uff0f\u5897\u7530\u5e79\u751f\uff0f\u677e\u5cf6\u4e00\u592b\uff0f\u4e38\u5c71\u6d69\uff0f\u7f8e\u6a39\u672c\u6674\u5f66\uff0f\u78a7\u98a8\u7fbd\uff0f\u4e09\u597d\u8f09\u514b\uff0f\u6751\u702c\u502b\u592a\u90ce\uff0f\u6751\u5c71\u7adc\u5927\uff0f\u7791\u4e38\u30a4\u30cc\u30c1\u30e8\uff0f\u3082\u3063\u3061\u30fc\uff0f\u767e\u702c\u5bff\uff0f\u5c71\u5d0e\u592a\u90ce\uff0f\u5c71\ufa11\u5948\u82d7\uff0f\u7531\u5229\u771f\u73e0\u90ce\uff0f\u7adc\u5fb9Card List Additional cards  In the English version of this set, the following cards (which were promo cards in the Japanese version) were added:Trivia Toshiki Kai  Toshiki Kai is the deuteragonist in the anime and manga. During Season 4, he becomes the main protagonist after Aichi's disappearance. He is also the main protagonist of Neon Messiah, along with Aichi. He is a very serious character. It is known from the end of episode 1 that he had previously met\u00a0Aichi\u00a0and gave him the card\u00a0Blaster Blade, which later becomes the heart of Aichi's\u00a0Royal Paladin\u00a0deck.\u00a0His Vanguard Circle color is red.Name  Despite continuous reference to 'Kai' both in-series and out, Kai's given name is in fact Toshiki. Going with Japanese rules of etiquette, none of the characters in Vanguard refer to Kai by his given name because none of them are close enough to him socially to speak to him as such, much like how Mr. Mark only refers to Aichi as Sendou, and Katsumi Morikawa refers to Kamui as Katsuragi.Personality  Kai is a serious person and doesn't like to joke around like other people his age. He doesn't talk much or to anyone. When cardfighting, he is shown to be more serious and confident on winning the game without any need of support. Despite his selectively mute personality, he has a best friend, who is\u00a0Taishi Miwa. There is also some speculation and various scenes in the anime that suggest Kai might have a soft spot for Aichi, even though he refuses to admit it. Often times, his friend Miwa will tease him about it. According to Miwa, Kai used to be more friendly before he moved away. Kai is shown to have some knowledge when it comes to cooking and especially like onions. Whether this stems from him living alone and having to fend for himself remains to be seen. He shares the popular phrase, \"Final Turn!\" with Ren Suzugamori, though Aichi recently adopted it as well as he got corrupted by PSY Qualia. This probably came from the fact that Ren and Kai were once on the same team. After the VF Circuit, Kai adopts friendly personality towards Miwa and the rest of his friends at Card Capital, which he goes to a lot now, but still retains his seriousness and confidence. He is shown to be more supportive and helpful with his school's Cardfight Club; he loaned Morikawa his old Kagero\u00a0deck and helped Izaki train for the High School Vanguard Championships, showing he now tolerates the two. This extends outside of the club, shown with Aichi when he gives him advice, and Naoki after their fight. However, while watching how Aichi was able to defeat his old Kagero deck, and his match against Ren, he starts to feel inferior after witnessing how much their skills have grown, lamenting that he would probably lose if he fought them as he is currently. After he became Reversed, Kai becomes obsessed with challenging strong fighters so Link Joker will become stronger. When facing such a fighter, for example Kenji, Kai will remark on that strength, saying that it is what he has been looking for. His manga counterpart personality differs from his anime counterpart. He still is very much a serious person and is quite confident of him winning cardfight battles. Although he retains his seriousness, he actually enjoys going to Card Capital and smiles quite often. He seems more friendly and supportive towards Aichi. Also, he appears to talk more towards Miwa. In Episode 162, however, Kai shows a different side to him. Horrified by what he's done, Kai challenges Aichi and reveals that what he's done hasn't caused anyone any happiness, and attempts to go into self-exile to amend for his crimes. In Season 4, he starts to open up more and becomes friendlier than he was in the previous seasons. He also considers to keep his mates out of danger that shows he cares about his friends (Mates). In the G series, he is more friendly and he doesn't seem to be as serious as he is seen smiling more. However, it seems he still secretly blames himself for the Link Joker incident, as he decided to follow Noa Hoshizaki, after learning from Nome Tatsunagi that he was possessed by Star-vader, Chaos Breaker DragonAbilities  Despite not having PSY Qualia himself, Kai possesses a few abilities reminiscent of said power. The most notable is his bond with Dragonic Overlord, which throughout the series has evolved to match Kai's feelings. When he was searching for the power to beat Ren, it evolved into Dragonic Overlord the End. When Kai was Reversed, it evolved into Dragonic Overlord \"The \u042fe-birth\". When he learned the value of mates, it evolved into Perdition Emperor Dragon, Dragonic Overlord the Great. Also, he was able to see Brandt. He is consistently touted as being the best player in terms of raw ability, and his name quickly becomes well known throughout the world. He also demonstrates an incredible ease mastering new units, an ability showcased numerous times in season 1. On several occasions, he nearly completely rebuilds his deck once new cards are released, but plays them effectively and effortlessly as though he'd been using them his whole life. He is the first to show off Superior Riding, the Megablast technique, Crossriding, the Persona Blast technique, Limit Break, Ultimate Break, and Legion (technically however, due to the English anime not dubbing Season 4, that makes Ibuki the first to display Legion in English specifically, though Kai does use Legion later on). It is worth noting that Kai acknowledges a similar ability in Ren, but Ren's seems to be more based off an intuition for how cards work together than Kai's more experience based skill.Biography Season 1  Kai was first seen in the local card shop, cardfighting with Katsumi Morikawa and beat him easily as he rode his trump card, Dragonic Overlord. Then Morikawa requested a rematch, at first Kai rejected it, reasoning that he was not strong enough but accepted when he bet a card which attracted his attention, Blaster Blade, a card he stole from Aichi. Kai disposed of him easily and took the card, then Aichi came and challenge him to claim back his card. Kai accepted the challenge and teaches him the rules because Aichi was a beginner in Cardfight!! Vanguard. Before the cardfight starts, Kai returns the card to Aichi, hoping that he will use it effectively against him. Throughout the fight, Aichi learns that Kai was the one who gave the card to him during his childhood. Eventually, Kai loses the game and returns the card to Aichi, though he purposely held back during the fight. Kai was seen again when Aichi and his friends spotted him walking back to his home. They decided to follow him secretly due to their curiosity, but Kai figures out they were tailing him. Aichi apologizes and asks him for another battle, but he declines it. However, when Kamui Katsuragi challenges him, he accepts it with an askance look. The next day, the two commence their fight. At first, Kai took the upper hand by riding a Grade 3 card very quickly, but shortly afterwards, Kamui countered it with his own Grade 3 card. However, Kai once again proved that he was the strongest as he rode\u00a0Vortex Dragon, proceeding to activate its Mega Blast to retire the rear-guard units controlled by Kamui, leaving Kamui defenseless for the final attack from Kai. He left the scene after he defeated Kamui, but not before Aichi told him he vowed to become a stronger and more worthy opponent in order to challenge Kai again. After that, he entered the Local Shop Tournament, with a hope that he would find some strong opponent. However, he easily reached the Semi-Final in the tournament. After the setup of the Semi-Final round, he was selected to be the next opponent of Misaki. Kai announced \"Final Turn\" before he easily claimed victory against Misaki. During the final round, he once again defeated Kamui effortlessly and took the champion title. After the tournament, he was invited into the Regional Tournament with Kamui, Misaki and Aichi as a team, called Team Q4, short for Team Quadrifoglio. In the First Round of the Regional Tournament, he annihilates his opponent without even breaking a sweat. Team Q4 easily won the second and third round. During the Finals of the Regional Tournament, he has a close fight against Kaoru but stills wins the cardfight with two critical triggers. However, it was shown that Kai purposely let his opponent take the lead before crushing him, hoping to motivate Aichi's will to fight. During Kai's match with Kyou Yahagi, the latter taunts him with the fact that he and Ren both say, \"Final Turn!\" Kyou's, however, fails and Kai turns the tables on him shortly afterward. After the first Regional championship, Kai starts suspecting that Aichi might have the same ability as Ren. During Aichi's fight with Kyou, Kai confirmed it. Kai, not wanting to suffer what happened with Ren again, told Aichi that he is not getting stronger, but weaker, and quits Team Q4. He also appears to blame himself for this and for the currently unknown incident that happened with Ren, as shown by how after quitting Team Q4 he said \"he made the same mistake again.\" Kai later fought against\u00a0Kourin Tatsunagi, who was looking for him and suspected he also had PSY Qualia, but confirmed that he didn't. Kai also said it is his fault that Aichi obtained PSY Qualia, and that he wants to exceed it. Then he accepted to help stop Aichi before he fully becomes like Ren. Kai cardfights Aichi and talks about his past, how Aichi showed him that Vanguard fights are supposed to be fun and not all about power, later convincing him to abandon using PSY Qualia that true strength does not comes from that power but oneself. Before the final match of the nationals, he challenges Ren for a fight in order to bring his former self back. Kai draws the card that will be the trump card to beat Ren and crossrides Dragonic Overlord the End saying that he will bring Ren back with this card. But Ren crossrides Phantom Blaster Overlord and wins. Later, he is seen in the match between Aichi vs Ren, where he helps Aichi snap out of PSY Qualia's influence. After the match, he gives Ren and Aichi a smile and thanks Aichi for saving Ren. At the end of the season, Kai finally challenges Aichi to a proper cardfight.Season 2  Kai is first shown fighting against Takuto Tatsunagi, who was using a Gold Paladin deck. Towards the end of the fight, Takuto rides Great Silver Wolf, Garmore,\u00a0which transforms Kai's Kagero deck into a Narukami deck.\u00a0The next day, Kai spots Aichi in the park and challenges him to a fight and during the battle, Kai does reveal he believes Aichi's story and starts to have certain memory flashes of Aichi's Blaster Blade. Kai starts training to become stronger and fights Kyou on a mountain, winning the fight and triggering an avalanche, which Kai saves Kyou from. During the Seoul Stage, he is seen with Ren and Asaka in his new team, Team New Asteroid, who wins all of their battles against Team Movie Stars in the first round of the Seoul Stage.\u00a0He fights Kamui in the next match-up against Team Q4, winning the match by taking advantage of the special rule, using Dragonic Kaiser Vermillion's Limit Break twice in the match. He appears beside Tetsu after the match, watching Ren's and Asaka's match. Kai does not have any recollection of PSY Qualia as he did not react when Ren says that the power is incredible.\u00a0In the final round of the Seoul Stage, he wins the match against\u00a0Team Caesar's\u00a0Gai Usui. Team New Asteroid is invited to a summer resort island to train by the Tatsunagi Financial Group. He watches Aichi and his friends training on the beach. He paired up with Aichi for the Test of Courage and tells him that their paths will cross. Next morning,\u00a0Kai is asked by Ren to play beach volleyball with him and Asaka, but declines, and asked Miwa out to cardfight with him. Later in the afternoon, he sees Q4 off from land as they go back to Japan, in preparation for the next stage. Kai and the rest of the winners of each stage gather in Japan, the last stage of the VF Circuit. New Asteroid wanders around the amusement park where the final stage is held. After the winning ceremony, all the teams gather in a room that has a portal that creates a space connected between Cray and Earth to fight a mysterious empty power,\u00a0Void. New Asteroid gets separated from the other teams by\u00a0Leon Soryu\u00a0not long after their arrival in the space. Ren uses his\u00a0PSY Qualia\u00a0to track Leon's whereabouts. After finding Leon, Kai challenges Leon and expresses his anger about \"sacrificing\" the three clans to bring back\u00a0Aqua Force. He crossrides Dragonic Kaiser Vermillion \"THE BLOOD\"\u00a0to counter Leon's\u00a0Aqua Force\u00a0units, but Leon managed to survive and crossrides\u00a0Blue Storm Supreme Dragon, Glory Maelstrom\u00a0and takes the win. Kai and his team were sent back to Earth as defeated cardfighters cannot exist in that space.Season 3  He is now a Second-year student at his high school and is a part of his school's cardfight club. He is seen briefly in episode 107, battling a kid in Card Capital. During the intermural fight against Aichi's school, he is matched up against Naoki Ishida. He acknowledges his skill in Vanguard as Naoki pushes Kai to 5 damage. However, Kai manages to win the match with Eradicator, Dragonic Descendant and agreed to fight Naoki again. Later in the matchup, he swapped Morikawa's deck with his old Kagero deck. Through that cardfight, he sees Aichi grow even stronger as a player, commenting that even Dragonic Overlord The End could not reach him anymore. During the tournament, he fights against Shingo crushing him completely commenting that he wanted to fight Aichi instead. But after his team fails to advance and after watching Ren and Aichi's Cardfight, Kai soon realizes that their skills have grown to the point where not even he can reach them anymore. He is later seen in Episode 126: The Mystery Dragon, where he witnesses a Reversed Naoki Ishida cardfight Aichi. After the fight, Kai picks up the mysterious card Eradicator, Vowing Saber Dragon \"\u042feverse\"\u00a0which burns right before his very eyes. He then confronts Takuto Tatsunagi about\u00a0\"Reverse,\"\u00a0and ends up cardfighting Takuto's other side, who uses the Link Joker clan in an attempt to Reverse him. Tempting Kai with the power of Link Joker, the agent of Void, he\u00a0accepts the power of Reverse and becomes a catalyst of what is to come. The next day, he goes to see Ren to fight him, only to be told by Tetsu that he is not there, so, as an alternative, he decides to fight Tetsu instead with his new power, which Tetsu assumes is a new Narukami unit (as no one other than Takuto and Kai know about Link Joker at the time). He defeats and Reverses Tetsu Shinjou, and walks out Fukuhara High saying he hasn't mastered Link Joker yet. In his quest to master the Link Joker deck, he decides to leave the country running into\u00a0Kenji Mitsusada, defeating and Reversing him as an unexpected bonus. \u00a0He is later seen on a plane that is heading towards New York in America, possibly looking for stronger fighters. But it was later revealed that Kai went to New York to reverse countless of cardfighters around the world. In episode 147, after Kai returned to Japan, Takuto's secretary was sent to drive Kai to meet Takuto but his journey was intercepted by Miwa who sought answers from Kai. Kai managed to reverse Miwa, revealing that he became a reversed fighter by his own will to be able to fight Aichi and Ren as their equal. He is later seen observing a fight between Miwa and Misaki on top of a building. After witnessing Miwa's loss against Misaki, he now gets into a cardfight with Aichi, saying how he has waited for this moment. He confidently wins the fight, entering the building satisfied with what he had accomplished. After Aichi and Ren storm the Tatsunagi building, Takuto has Kai fight Ren, a match both have been looking forward to since their fight from Season 1, with Kai finally understanding why Ren would ever be tempted by such a power like PSY Qualia due to his experience with the Link Joker power. Ren revealed his new crossbreak ride,\u00a0Revenger, Dragruler Phantom\u00a0in an attempt to win on final turn. However, Kai manages to hold out and reveals his newest ace card,\u00a0Dragonic Overlord \"The \u042fe-birth\", a Reverse unit that even Takuto did not know existed,\u00a0and manages to attack him up to three times, the final attack ending on a triple critical. Both knew from the start that Ren could not heal enough times to save himself but continued to damage check anyway because of how much they both enjoyed their cardfight managing to heal twice before submitting. With this victory, Kai became truly satisfied as when Takuto ordered Kai to fight Aichi, he refused because he already defeated him before and thus sidelines himself to observe Aichi and Takuto's fight. After Aichi and Takuto's fight, Kai appears in front of Aichi still reversed saying that he was the opponent he was looking for and challenged him to a cardfight. Kai states that he is in the middle of being un-Reversed and declares that, at his strongest, he wants to face Aichi at his strongest before he becomes completely un-Reversed and loses his deck. He tells Aichi that not only did he accept Link Joker, but its power never truly took control of him and knew exactly what he was doing. Knowing that, he declares that this will be his last fight against Aichi as he will disappear from his life due to the things he did when he was Reversed. Aichi says that he shouldn't disappear from their lives as Kai had become an example of what he should strive for as a cardfighter. They symbolize this by riding Blaster Blade and Dragonic Overlord, units that have become synonymous with each respective cardfighter. As he tries to overpower Aichi, Aichi manages to hold out his defenses. He finishes the fight with\u00a0Liberator, Monarch Sanctuary Alfred\u00a0which superior calls the field including Blaster Blade Liberator which finishes him off. As he is unreversed, Kai understands that by shutting everyone away, he doesn't become stronger but through friends and rivals, one can become stronger and stronger while at the same time raising everyone's strength around them. With this in mind, he has a new plan to get stronger, together with his best friend Aichi.Season 4  A while after the end of Link Joker's failed invasion, Kai headed over to Card Capital to see Aichi only for Shin to wonder who he is. Upon asking Emi and later Misaki, they both say that they do not know Aichi and he realizes that something is wrong. Upon entering the Physics room where Aichi would hold his Cardfight club, he is given a Royal Paladin deck with\u00a0Blaster Blade Seeker. He encounters Naoki who was curious about Kai having forgotten about Aichi as well. He challenges him to a cardfight as he notices that Naoki is getting a reaction upon seeing the deck. Upon riding Blaster Blade, Naoki finally remembers Aichi as they vow to find him. He then challenges Misaki as she got a reaction from seeing Blaster Blade and hopes to trigger that memory with a cardfight. As they fight, Kai attempts to drop subtle hints towards her past when she was using Oracle Think Tank. At the end of the fight, Kai demonstrates\u00a0Seeker, Sacred Wingal's\u00a0ability to Legion\u00a0with Blaster Blade Seeker finally unlocking Misaki's memories of Aichi. Seeing as how these effects triggered both Naoki and Misaki's memories of Aichi, Kai now sees a way to gain allies in search of the missing Aichi. He seeks Ren as a potential mate but after showing him Blaster Blade, it doesn't trigger any hidden memories and Kai gives up for now. During Kai and Miwa's club meeting (which Morikawa and Izaki are not a part of), he challenges Miwa by giving him his Kager\u014d deck and engage in a match similar to Kai and Aichi's first cardfight. Upon riding\u00a0Seeker, Thing Saver Dragon\u00a0and using Blaster Blade to Legion with it, he unlocks Miwa's memories of Aichi. Upon seeing Ultra Rare on the television, Kai remembers Aichi telling him of a cardshop called Psy that the idol group runs. Hoping to find clues about Aichi's and Kourin's disappearance. Kourin's, he goes there. However, instead of finding what he was looking for, he met a mysterious young man named Olivier Gaillard who introduced himself as a Quatre Knight. Gaillard tells Kai to forget about looking for Aichi, but the latter refuses. They engaged in a match with Gaillard triumphing in the end. Kai suffers judgement after he had lost, which is going through a fire the burns away the person's fighting will, from the result of the Holy Prominence Prison. Galliard then warns Kai that there are other Quatre Knights besides him and that they will destroy anyone that gets in the way, including Kai's mates. Gaillard disappears in a blaze of blue fire afterwards, leaving Kai flat on the ground, agonizing over the situation at hand. He struggles to get to the others in time as he catches up to Ishida after facing judgement and together finds Miwa in the same way realizing that this may be an enemy they are not ready for. Upon realizing that the Quatre Knights are just going to keep going after Kai's group, he decides to abandon his mates and go after Aichi alone. But Kamui, not wanting Kai to act alone anymore, defeats him in a cardfight saying that as his mates, they are willing to go into these dangerous situations knowing the consequences. Kai relents and accepts the group's help in the end. Then, as Misaki and Kamui are at the airport, he challenges Ren to fight him and learn everything he knows. He defeats him and reveals a stone circle formation which lead them to a portal area which they are greeted by Gaillard who defeats Naoki easily. As Kai gets ready to fight, they are surprised by an appearance by Kourin who allies herself not only with the Quatre Knights, but now uses the Link Joker clan. During their fight, Kai is shown an image of Aichi who tells them to forget about him and leave. While the others believe they are being tricked, Kai acknowledges that this is the real Aichi as his words burn deep as he loses to Kourin. While undergoing Judgement, Kourin takes Blaster Blade Seeker to give back to Aichi as the portals are destroyed. Needing to train, everyone decided to visit Leon Soryu's island. While there, Kai watched Leon defeat Naoki four times before Leon decided to fight Kai to figure out his thoughts. Kai loses, and Leon does not detect any wind behind his actions; meaning Kai seemed to be lacking something important. Miwa then tossed a Kager\u014d deck to him and Kai realized that if he wanted to get Aichi back, Kai had to be true to himself, which included going back to his Kager\u014ds. After Naoki found the entrance to their base, they storm it in hopes of defeating the Quatre Knights, but under the risk that if they lost, their memories of Aichi would be purged as well. Undaunted, Kai continued on until he reached Gaillard after the latter had defeated Kamui. He then challenged Gaillard and defeated him with his new Legion\u00a0Perdition Dragon, Vortex Dragonewt, with his flames overwhelming Gaillard's. However, after defeating him, Kai, Gaillard and Naoki are all trapped in Raul Serra's ice prison, with Gaillard's flames being too weak to melt the ice after receiving Kai's Judgement. With the help of Leon and Ren, they manage to escape. After witnessing Gaillard defeat Raul and enacting Memory Judgement upon him, Kai and Gaillard fought once more with Kai unveiling his reborn avatar\u00a0Perdition Emperor Dragon, Dragonic Overlord the Great\u00a0and overwhelming Gaillard in a heated battle. He then set his sights upon Aichi who revealed his corrupted avatar,\u00a0Star-vader, Blaster Joker\u00a0and asked that if Kai loses, he will become a Quatre Knight, which he agreed to. During the fight Kai kept trying to convince Aichi not to isolate himself from his mates, but Aichi didn't listen and rode his avatar, Blaster Joker. He then performed Legion with Kourin's avatar Photon, and demonstrated his Legion's ability, Absolute Lock, which locked all of Kai's rear-guards and retired his Legion Mate, Neo-Flame. Kai was astounded by this ability but did not waver, riding Overlord again and performing Legion once more. He tried to win that turn, but Aichi stopped his second Legion attack. Aichi used Absolute Lock once more, retiring Neo-Flame and locking Kai's units. Kai sensed the good part within Blaster Joker then and blocked the attack. He then made use of Aichi's thoughts against him, which lead Aichi to be conflicted about what he had done. Kai then asked if anyone was willing to take Aichi's burden, with everybody agreeing, much to his opponent's surprise. To prove Aichi that everybody will save him from his fate, Kai declared Final Turn and rode Overlord for the third time, performing Legion once more. Ren noted that Kai was \"milking\" Legion, but Leon said that it was showing his bond with his mates. Kai had Overlord attack Imaginary Plane Dragon, pulling a Double Critical drive check. He then stood his Legion and attacked Aichi's Legion. Aichi guarded, but Kai pulled another Double Critical drive check, breaking through with 5 Critical and leaving Aichi with no chance of recovering, thus winning the game. After the fight, the Seed of Link Joker attacked Kai but Kai called out to Blaster Blade. Blaster Joker then returned to normal, cutting through the Seed. Then all of Aichi's friends appeared as the avatar of Blaster Blade, breaking the Seed into fragments, which entered everyone who witnessed the fight. Blaster Blade then said that the Seed will now enter fighters who know forgiveness, saying that one day Link Joker will be accepted by Cray as a new Clan instead of an invader. He then envisions himself sparing with Blaster Dark and Blaster Joker. The next day after the incident, Kai waits for Aichi at Cardfight Capital after defeating Miwa several times. Once Aichi comes, he then challenges Aichi to a cardfight. In Episode 195, a year later, he was mentioned that several pro collage and leagues were planning on recruiting him but he has not made any plans yet until he appeared at the end meeting Aichi and Naoki at the place the former two first met. In episode 196, after the graduation ceremony he was finally more interactive with others as he sighed an autograph for a girl who asked for it. At the tournament he was shocked to see Ren wearing his trench coat again and mentioned during his fight with him that he \"hated\" that Ren's look. In the final round, he was about to fight Aichi as he mentioned that he will be going to Europe to fight and train with Gaillard and wouldn't be able to fight with him for a while but Aichi assured him as long as they play the game they will fight each other again as they both open up their vanguards.G Season 2  Kai makes a reappearance in Cardfight!!

Kai then covered Shion, who had fallen asleep, with his black jacket that he wore in Season 2. The next day, Kai was announced as the Super Chaser for Dragon Empire G Quest and those who beat him would gain 10000 points. Kai was later seen watching Shion and Miwa fight in order to release Chrono and Tokoha. Miwa then hints that Kai and Ibuki are the 'bad guys' in Star Gate. That night, Kai, Miwa and Ibuki were having dinner on a boat while discussing about TRY3 and how Shion wants to become stronger. Later Kai is seen again as one of the bosses of the Star Gate Branch G Quest along with Ibuki. He was then challenged by Shion and faced with his Narukami deck. After seeing how strong Shion's image, he then beats him and tells him that he's willing to fight him anytime. After the match, he tells Ibuki that Team TRY3 may surpassed his expectation from them.G Season 3  To be added.G Season 4  Kai appears in episode 26 in Card Capital waiting for Aichi.

He wins against Morikawa. Miwa comes out saying that Kai is the best cardfighter even asking Misaki if there was any other cardfighter that are as good as Kai. Kai went to step out leaving Miwa and the others. He wonders if there was any good cardfighters at all and mentions that he would never get any better than what he is now. He and Miwa were at Card Capital when Morikawa came out again to challenge Kai once more though Kai rejected the invitation when Morikawa pulled out Blaster Blade. Miwa was outcome with joy at that the fact that Morikawa had such a card and asked to cardfight him for the card. Kai was shocked to have seen Blaster Blade wondering where did Morikawa came upon the card. Miwa was able to win against Morikawa making him the new owner of Blaster Blade, but Kai took the card to see if it was the same card. Aichi came running through the shop begging Morikawa for his card back though of course he lost the card to Miwa. Aichi then asked if he could have it back only for both Kai and Miwa to answer that he must win it back through a cardfight. Although Aichi was shy about cardfighting, he admitted that he had a deck and willing to take a challenge from Kai. Since it was his first battle, Kai taught him the basic of the game and gave him Blaster Blade back seeing that his deck probably needed it. Aichi won against Kai and told Kai that he was glad to be able to meet him, saying also that it was fun playing against him. In chapter 2, he and Miwa is waiting in Card Capital for Aichi to come. They greeted him. Miwa and Aichi fought against each other. Miwa won the battle and said that he was the greatest cardfighter. Kai countered that he always loses to him, but Miwa countered back saying that Aichi won against him. Kai then said that they should cardfight only to be interrupted by Kamui as he made his way to the shop. Kamui asked who was the strongest cardfighter. Miwa said that he was, but Kai said that he lost to him, causing him to say that he lost to Aichi, only for Aichi to say that he lost to Miwa which in turned caused Kamui to spin around in confusion. Kamui decided to fight against Miwa and won. Kai told Aichi that he should go against Kamui. Aichi said that he wasn't good though Kai said that he won against him so he should be able to have some skill learned already. Aichi won against Kamui which caused Kamui to say that he will be more like Aichi. Then Miwa said that he should be more like him and not Aichi. This, of course, caused Kamui to see the circle again. Kai is shown smiling at his friends. In one chapter, it was mentioned by Miwa to Aichi that Kai had planned to make a deck with Blaster Blade back when he had the card. Of course, Kai told him to not bother with this. Aichi was amazed and shocked to know of this. Back when he was younger, he used to sleep on the park bench. He was awoken by Miwa who brought along a classmate who Kai doesn't even know even though they are classmates. He told Kai that Ibuki was going to teach them how to play Cardfight!! Vanguard. Being the hothead he was, he kept losing to Ibuki. Seeing this, he decided to go home to make his own deck. At home, he began to try to image a winning picture and found one. The next day, he asked Ibuki to fight him. Ibuki was surprised at him using a Royal Paladin deck. Kai said that it was a new clan that focuses on using magic and old tech together. He surprised Ibuki even more when he used Blaster Blade, a unit that is noted by Ibuki that can still grow, in his deck. He then used Blaster Blade Burst to win the battle. Ibuki was happy that Kai was doing something fun. Kai was shown to be walking away when a familiar someone walked along the same path too.", "TYPE-MOON Wiki": "TYPE-MOON Wiki TYPE-MOON Wiki  vi:Saber (Fate/stay night)  Saber\u00a0(\u30bb\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc, Seib\u0101) is one of the main characters of Fate/Zero and one of the three main heroines of Fate/stay night. She is the Saber-class Servant of Kiritsugu Emiya in the Fourth Holy Grail War and Shirou Emiya in the Fifth Holy Grail War. She is the Servant of Norma Goodfellow (possessed by Manaka Sajyou) in the Holy Grail War of Fate/Labyrinth. She is one of the Servants of Ritsuka Fujimaru of the Grand Orders conflicts of Fate/Grand Order.Profile Identity  Saber's True Name is Artoria Pendragon, better known as Arthur Pendragon and King Arthur, who is regarded as a male in history. She is the \"Once and Future King\" and a legendary hero of Britain known as the King of Knights\u00a0(\u9a0e\u58eb\u738b, Kishi-\u014c). She wielded the sword from the stone, Caliburn, but it was eventually destroyed. She later obtained Excalibur and Avalon from the Lady of the Lake. While Arthur is a hero well known as a model for knights, it is said that he actually existed as \"Dux Bellorum\", the leader of War, and was a great general who led the twelve kings of Northern England, Gododdin, while preventing foreign invasion from forces such as the Scottish and the Picts. This identity of the real great leader behind the legend of King Arthur has many variations, and it is thought that there may have been two people who fit the description of the king. One is the full Briton Arthur, while the other is the Roman Arturius, and their two separate sets of accomplishments are said to have merged into the legend of King Arthur that is known in the present time.Childhood  Artoria was born into a time of chaos and war that began with the demise of the Roman empire. It had been believed to be indestructible, but it was only awaiting its destruction at the hands of invading barbarians. In preparation for the war against the barbarians, Rome deprived her island province of any military forces left there. Once Britannia lost the empire's protection, it could not escape becoming independent, causing it to break into smaller countries soon after. This time of barbarian invasions and self-destructive strife between clans started a long period of war that would later become known as the \"Dark Ages\". Artoria was born into this period as the heir to the throne, the daughter of the King of Britain, Uther Pendragon, and the blue-eyed Igraine, the wife of Uther's servant, the Duke of Cornwall. The king, believing in Merlin's prophecy, yearned for the birth of his appointed successor, but the child born was a girl--not the one he desired. It is said in the legend that Arthur was left in Merlin's care as the price for his assistance in ensuring the success for Uther's love of Igraine, saying \"I will properly guide this child, one bearing a great destiny, and protect him from the crisis of the royal family.\" The true reality was that Artoria was not a boy, so the king could not make a child that was not male his successor even if she was fated to one day become a king. She was entrusted to the king's vassals and was to be raised as the child of a mere knight. The king fell into despair at the situation, but Merlin was delighted because the sex of the one to become king had never mattered. He was confident that the fact of the girl being separated from the castle until the day of prophecy was proof that she would become king. Merlin placed Artoria in the care of Sir Ector, a simple and wise old knight, who raised her as his adopted child and successor. Though Ector did not believe in the prophecy, he did feel the same air from the girl as he did his king. He felt that he must raise her as a knight, and he wished for her to grow. He never needed to wish for such a thing, as she trained day after day to become stronger than anyone. She swore to bear her sword for the only reason that \"only a king can save a ruined country headed for death\" without ever being told such. During this time, she was raised with Sir Kay as her brother, but they still loved each other as siblings after she learned the truth of their relationship. She acted as his squire and received training from him, while also doing other chores such as pulling along his horse. She was better than him in terms of swordsmanship, but she never beat him in a fight due to his arguments declaring himself the winner rather than actual skill.  Once the day of prophecy arrived, knights and lords from around the country gathered to be selected as king. Each expected the selection to be through jousting to select the most superior one to become a king, but the only thing prepared at the place of selection was a naked sword stuck in a stone with a golden inscription on the hilt reading \"Whosoe'er pulleth out this sword of this stone is rightwise king born of England.\" While many knights grabbed the sword trying to follow the command, none were able to pull it out. As they began the expected method of selection by jousting, Artoria, only an apprentice not qualified for jousting, neared the deserted stone of selection and reached out for the sword without hesitation. Before grabbing it, Merlin appeared before her to tell her to think things over before taking it. He told her she would no longer be human upon taking hold of the sword, but she only responded with a nod because she has been prepared for the fact that \"becoming a king means no longer being human\" ever since she was born. She knew that a king is someone who kills everyone to protect everyone. She thought about it every night and shuddered until morning came. While not one day passed where she did not fear that fact, she said that it would end this day. The sword was pulled out as if it were only natural to do so, and the area was filled with light. She became something not human in that instant. The king's gender doesn't matter, and no one will care about the king's appearance or even notice it as long as the king acts like a king. Even if anybody did notice the king was female, it would not be an issue if she was a good king. This started the time of the king who would become a legend. She stopped aging at 15 years old, back when she pulled Caliburn from the stone.Kingship  Artoria led Britain from Camelot, and after becoming a feudal lord like her father, she became a king with many knights under her, including the esteemed Knights of the Round Table. Her growth stopped at that time she pulled the sword because of its magic, so many knights feared it as ominous. Most instead praised their master's immortality as divine. Her battles thereafter were the acts of a god of war. She always led from the front, and no enemies could stand in her way. There was no defeat for a body admired as a dragon in human form. She only knew victory for ten years and twelve battles while she ran through those days as the king. She never turned back and was never disgraced. She was raised as a king and fulfilled her obligations as the king.Personal affairs  Due to the problem of being able to produce an heir, Merlin used magecraft to turn her into a pseudo-male capable of producing sperm for an unknown duration of time. During this period, she was enchanted by her sister, Morgan le Fay, who took some of Artoria's sperm, developed it within her own ovaries, and gave birth to the homunculus and complete clone of Artoria, Mordred. She was born and raised without Artoria's knowledge, quickly growing up due to her accelerated aging, and she managed to join the Round Table through her own efforts and Morgan's recommendation. She worshiped her king while hiding her identity, and she was ecstatic to learn of her heritage. Upon claiming her heritage and right to the throne, Artoria completely rejected Mordred, and refused to recognize her as an heir. Mordred believed the reason that she was not accepted was due to the hatred her father bore Morgan, and that no matter how much she worked to excel over others, she would forever be viewed as a tainted existence. The love she had for the king up until that point was so great that her rejection made her hatred burn. She married Guinevere, but it was only out of obligation to have a wife. The truth was that Lancelot, one of Artoria's closest friends, and Guinevere loved each other, and due to Artoria having concealed her gender, Guinevere had to carry the burden of this her entire life. Guinevere felt guilt for her actions, but felt relief that it was Lancelot who had fallen in love with her. He, who shared the same ideals as the king, would share the burden with her and not cause the country to fall into a dangerous situation. He did so, supporting Guinevere and the King from the dark on his unrighteous path.Kingdom  Artoria needed to act as the son of the king, as the one to govern the many territories and control the knights had to be male. While some people did grow suspicious of her, only her father, Merlin, and Kay knew the exact truth of her identity. She literally covered herself in steel to seal that truth for all her life, and due to her immortality from the protection of the fairies, no one questioned her small body or face that seemed like that of a girl. She was honored by the knights as a good-looking king, thought of as an invincible warrior whose looks or body size had impact on her standing. During that time, the people living in fear of savage invasions only wanted a strong king, and the knights would only follow an excellent commander. Having met these criteria, no one questioned her. She was considered fair and selfless as she always stood at the front of the army while defeating her enemies on the battlefield. While many enemies and civilians died, the king's choices were always considered correct, and she served as the king better than anyone else. No one doubted or had any need to doubt as long as the king was right. Her army reconstructed the lost cavalry, and knowing no losses, they ran through the battlefield while defeating foreign infantries and crashing through numerous ramparts. Many people were discarded for her to join the battles, and all her enemies had to be defeated once she joined. It was common practice for the military to meet its needs by sucking all the resources out of a local village to supply the battle to protect the country. It can be said that no knight killed more people than her, and it is unknown if she ever found such to be a burden. She strictly kept to the oath that a king is not human and that one cannot protect the people with human emotions. She never narrowed her eyes in grief while sitting on the throne, and she settled every problem while working hard in government affairs. She managed to balance the country without any deviations, and she punished people without a single mistake. Even after, or possibly because of, winning battles in victory, commanding citizens without disorder, and punishing hundreds of criminals, one of her knights murmured \"King Arthur does not understand human feelings.\" It is possible everyone felt that way, that the more perfect she became as a king, the more they needed to question her as a ruler. They felt that a human without emotion cannot rule over others, leading to several reputable knights leaving Camelot. She simply accepted this to be a natural event that is part of the process of government, isolating the fair king honored by her knights. Having abandoned her emotions from the start, she did not change her mind even if she was abandoned, feared, or betrayed. There was no right or wrong to someone who saw such events as trivial. Her final battle for her country began in such a way, and the battle at Badon Hill ended in complete victory. The savages sought reconciliation due to her overwhelming results, and her country that was only awaiting destruction earned a brief period of peace. The country finally began to return to the country of which she had dreamed.Downfall  Lancelot's affair with Guinevere was eventually revealed through the plans of traitors who hated Camelot, causing them to stand opposed. Artoria did not see this inescapably unrighteous action as a betrayal, but instead understood Guinevere's sacrifice due to having concealed her gender. She wrote a letter of pardon to Lancelot and Guinevere, and gave them her blessings, saying that their actions \"must have good cause\".\u00a0However,\u00a0Lancelot\u00a0 was afraid and ran, bringing about a tragedy where no one was right and no one was wrong. Excalibur's scabbard was stolen while she repelled an assault along her country's borders; when she returned inland, she discovered Britain is being torn asunder by civil unrest. Despite her valiant efforts to placate the dissent, she was mortally wounded by the traitorous knight Mordred during the Battle of Camlann. Her dying body was escorted to a holy isle by Sir Bedivere. Artoria ordered a grieving Bedivere to dispose of Excalibur by throwing it back to the Lady of the Lake; in her absence, she reflected on her personal failures, regretting her life as king. Before her last breath, she appealed to the world; in exchange for services as a Heroic Spirit, she asked to be given an opportunity seek the Holy Grail to save her country.Appearance  Saber has the appearance of a young woman in her late teens with a slender physique, soft skin, and green eyes. She has \"finely textured\" blonde hair that seems \"as if sprinkled with gold dust.\" Her face shows some signs of naivety and displays elegance. She is more muscular than someone like Rin, leading her to believe her body is unappealing, but Shirou believes her to be very feminine. She normally wears shining armor with an old styled dress, made from old-fashioned blue cloth, underneath. She is actually older than her appearance would show, as her body did not age from the moment she pulled Caliburn from the stone to the time of her death. Shirou sees her as being a few years younger, and the age of her body is probably a year younger than him. Though she lived as a man most of her life, Shirou and Rin describe her as beautiful instantly upon seeing her. Despite her armor being unrefined and unaesthetic, Shirou describes Saber as being beautiful enough to make the steel clanking of her armor seem like the chiming of a bell. Due to her inability to dematerialize, she needs to wear modern clothing in order to travel in public. Though she can wear her own dress when not in battle, she needs modern clothing to keep from standing out. With the ability to control the materialization of her armor, she can be ready for battle instantly and return to normal without damaging the clothing. During the Fourth Holy Grail War, Irisviel decides to match Saber's clothing with her own appearance by dressing her as a man. During the Fifth Holy Grail War, Rin Tohsaka prepares clothes for Saber, a blue, knee-length skirt (with tights) and white shirt (with a blue string tie), and brown boots originally a birthday present to Rin from Kirei Kotomine. Due to the different variations of Saber and characters that look similar, she is often called Blue Saber\u00a0(\u9752\u30bb\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc, Ao Seib\u0101), Saber Alter is called Black Saber, and Saber Lily is called White Saber. Similar characters include Red Saber, Saber of Red, Sakura Saber, Gray, and Saber Lion. Though there is no direct connection to Red Saber, Nero Germanicus, King Arthur's model was said to be the fusion of two individuals including the Roman general Artorius, so it can be said there is some sort of relation between them.Joan of Arc is also often considered similar to Saber, Gray is a distant descendent of King Arthur and Mordred is a clone who shares her appearance.Personality  Saber is a strong-willed young woman who always speaks truthfully. She is courageous, determined, and set on winning the Holy Grail. She constantly insists that she is a knight and king above all, and that her gender is of little importance to her and her role. She is resolute in following her own morals, regardless of more the more\u00a0viable, yet underhand,\u00a0tactics being available. Saber prefers direct, fair confrontations based upon codes of chivalry.\u00a0Not even her hunger for the Holy Grail can make her abandon her code of honor. This leads to regular conflicts with Kiritsugu over strategy within the Fourth Holy Grail War. While obtaining the Holy Grail is of the utmost importance, rejecting her chivalry is something she will never do,\u00a0even if it should put her at a disadvantage. If such came to pass, she coldly replies that her master must use a Command Seal as recompense for treading upon her heart. When a master respects Saber's own rules, they tend to do very well with Saber, such as Irisviel being closer to Saber than her true master, Kiritsugu, is. Saber's identity\u00a0as both a \"human\"\u00a0and a \"king\" is one of the greatest struggles of her character throughout the Fourth and Fifth Holy Grail Wars. When she is first summoned to the Grail Wars of Fate/zero and Fate/stay night,\u00a0she doesn't like to be treated as a woman, or even as a human, due to her status as a knight and a Servant. She tries to keep the notion that she is only a Servant, a tool for her Master, first and foremost in her mind. A normally quiet and reserved young knight even begins to raise her voice in defense of this non-human identity. This focus\u00a0is so extreme that\u00a0she has no obvious reaction to being walked-in on by Shirou as she was naked, not understanding, or perhaps ignoring, his flustered response. She slowly becomes more aware of herself as a girl after her bonds with Shirou and Rin develop, and later realizes and displays\u00a0her true embarrassment at such a situation when it is accidentally repeated with another walk-in. Despite being granted knowledge of the modern world upon being summoned, Saber also shows some signs of being a 'fish-out-of-water' in many social situations due to her strong disconnect from her humanity in her past and lack of interaction with others her age and social status. She was unaware of the innuendo of the phrase 'between my legs' and didn't understand why Irisviel was giggling afterwards. She's also unaware of what a date is, as the Grail doesn't give data on minor modern social structure and phrasing, and only understands when Rin translates the word for her.\u00a0Due to conducting herself as an untouchable king\u00a0at all times her in past,\u00a0she is unfamiliar with affection or flirting from others.\u00a0Notably, she is sexually inexperienced as a woman, but seems knowledgeable about a man's sexual experiences nevertheless. Once Saber \"allows\" herself to become more self-aware of herself as a girl,\u00a0Saber becomes very obviously self-conscious of her body and hides it, remarking it \"unsightly\",\u00a0and makes conscious\u00a0efforts to stay out of the center of attention. On the flip side, she is also more aware of others' physical appearances, envying the voluptuous\u00a0Rider.\u00a0These experiences of womanhood\u00a0were, initially, incorrectly viewed by both Saber and Shirou to be a complete contradiction to her identity as the king of knights. This causes much strife between them, and internally, for Saber.\u00a0Through careful self-exploration and support from those around her, Saber finds the answer for herself: that she is allowed to be happy as a woman;\u00a0that she does not need to punish herself,\u00a0locking that part of herself\u00a0away, since she \"failed\" Britain;\u00a0and that she is a capable, respectable woman-king of Britain all the same. This accumulates in Saber accepting Shirou's love, and\u00a0her declaration to herself and Gilgamesh that she will always be \"a king before a woman\", but a woman king all the same. In Realta Nua, Saber journeys to Avalon and lives as this\u00a0person she wishes to be.\u00a0In Fate/hollow ataraxia, Saber acts to refine that womanhood and femininity among her peers, and\u00a0Sakura and Taiga help her with this when they go shopping together. Saber is loyal, independent, and reserved. She appears cold, but is usually suppressing her emotions to focus on her goals. She is bewildered by Shirou's \"protective\" tendencies, and believes his over-valuing of her humanity\u00a0jeopardizes her chances of winning the Holy Grail War. However, Saber is secretly deeply insecure, having no real sense of self-worth. As she was born and raised to be a king in service of her country, she has no sense of self-worth past that, and can only feel fulfilled by serving other people. Shirou realizes from his dreams of her past that, even though she is a supremely skilled warrior, she would be happier if she didn't have to fight at all. Throughout her rule, she was plagued by self-doubt about being a worthy king, and eventually came\u00a0to hate herself for not meeting the impossible standards she set for herself. She\u00a0feels deep guilt over the eventual destruction of her kingdom, holding herself\u00a0solely responsible and calling herself an\u00a0inadequate ruler.\u00a0When she was shown her death before pulling Caliburn, Saber accepted that she'd die alone being ostracized by everyone due to her taking many lives. However, even though she accepted that, she was horrified to find the reality of it would be that her kingdom would destroyed alongside her in the bloody Battle of Camlann Hill. She understood, as Merlin told her, that Britain would fall, but she wanted to believe its end would more peaceful like a slumber. As a result of these factors, her wish for much of the Fourth and Fifth Holy Grail Wars is to completely undo her rule so that someone more suitable can take her place in order to give Britain a peaceful end.\u00a0Rider and Shirou both chastise her for this, saying that to undo her rule would be an insult to all those who died in her name, or that she is selfish for wanting to redo the past merely because she didn't like the result. For the most part, Saber is a serious person who fully devotes herself whatever task she's given. This can especially true when it comes to competition, since she's sore loser, though truthfully her soreness is directed at her own weakness. Saber, normally over-sensitive to others' feelings, can become obstinate at her worst. She can spend\u00a0hours on a single task that she doesn't feel satisfied with, such as forcing Rin and Shirou to keep letting her play baseball because she is losing way past the time scheduled.\u00a0Her devotion to her kingly\u00a0duty, however, is obviously greater than any poor sportsmanship. Her fanatic lock-on to this \"duty\" can\u00a0disturb\u00a0others, who\u00a0see her denying herself of everything\u00a0for the sake of this duty. This zealotry causes her to be so stubborn in completing her duty that she ignores,\u00a0rejects, and/or actively fights against\u00a0others'\u00a0opinions in a desperate attempt for validation.\u00a0This is most obvious\u00a0in her fights with Shirou about her past. This tendency to fight against others who she disagrees with is compounded by how\u00a0Saber is unable to ignore what others say, even the smallest of words or actions. She cares greatly about others' opinions, and their disagreement hurts her greatly; her brother, Kay, compares\u00a0her heart to a reed in that respect. If the other party is, instead, making a transgression against her, she is extremely ready to fight, even physically, anyone for that perceived insult. This most often includes Shirou, in a great variety of\u00a0situations, both serious and light. Shirou implying that Saber is a human, and not a Servant, is immediately cornered verbally by Saber. At another time, Shirou is knocked\u00a0unconscious for teasing\u00a0her for playing with her lion plushy\u00a0in Fate/hollow ataraxia.\u00a0 Underneath her serious exterior that she feels forced to hold,\u00a0Saber shows herself to be a kind-hearted and gentle person who wishes to protect those she cares about. She is perceptive when it comes to the others' feelings and their troubles, almost dangerously so\u00a0when combined with her low self-worth and habit to overthink. This is best demonstrated in a positive way when she purposely forfeited a competition of best little sister to Illya when she saw her frustration at losing by pretending to overwhelmed by Illya's \"sister force\", even convincing Sakura (another competitor) to join her. Her ability to perceive others' troubles also made her reckless in her pursuit to save others during her training with Caliburn, for which she was scolded many times by Kay. Saber greatly enjoys seeing the happiness of others, even though she doesn't wish any happiness for herself. This trait is a cause of great concern to those who care about her, believe she should obtain her own happiness. Saber herself believes she doesn't deserves happiness due to her self-perceived failure\u00a0as king. She rarely smiles for herself but smiles for others upon seeing their happiness and safety. During her reign, she never laughed once, with the last time being during her training with Caliburn. She is still very capable of laughing, such as when she giggled at Shirou's joke about Rin wanting to use the Grail to rule the world. Her kind heart can also extend to her enemies, such as while identifying the Saxons as her enemies, she didn't see them as evil. Rather, she understood they sought Britain for a land to call home, believing their aspiration to be inherently good. During her younger days, Saber loved to take care of horses, which surprised Kay when she used them in battle, despite her love for them. But, to her, a horse dying in battle is a different sin than a soldier dying, as a soldier knows why they're on the battlefield, while a horse does not. This kind-hearted facet of Saber is seen as her true self for it is\u00a0a person free from unhealthy, inhuman expectations - Shirou sees it as a Saber who no longer needs to fight. When Saber does not feel as though she needs to be inhumanly strong, she is less argumentative and confrontational, for these are traits she developed\u00a0to make up for her inability to meet her impossible goals. Though she once felt more linked to dragons\u00a0due to her unique birth, she came to enjoy lions after taking care of a lion cub for a month at some point in her life. She claims that it is not that she \"likes\" them, but rather the happiness she experienced as he became attached to her brought forth a bond with them. The lion cub in her past\u00a0was very energetic, often biting or scratching, but she wished to be able to stay with him until the end. She has had feelings for lions since then and remembers these fond memories while holding\u00a0stuffed lions. Shirou, seeing the memory of her rubbing her cheek against the lion, comments on it being a special\u00a0time where she truly looks like a girl her age. She is shown to have a voracious appetite, finishing large servings of rice within one minute. Although she can normally eat anything, Shirou's food education is what awoke her gourmet spirit. She originally did not appreciate modern food, as she doesn't actually need to eat as a Servant, and because she had believed that all food was simple. She had very bad experiences with the food in her time, due to being limited to meals like large quantities of potatoes, vinegar, bread, and ale, or even at times simply eating vegetables alone in times of need. She did not concern herself with food much in her life and\u00a0allowed her cooks to do as they wished. She felt those dishes were\u00a0unrefined, although she was not displeased by them. She shudders at the thought of eating the food of her era once introduced to\u00a0Shirou's cooking. She thought it had been made to suit the tastes of the knights, because they acknowledged it as tasting good, but they simply were unable to say it was bad to the King's face.Gawain was an exception, and enjoyed the meals, not noticing the others' distaste for it.Relationships Role Fate/Zero  Saber is summoned by Kiritsugu Emiya to participate in the Fourth Holy Grail War on behalf of Jubstacheit von Einzbern and the Einzbern family. Kiritsugu was recruited by Jubstacheit and given Avalon, excavated from Cornwall, to summon the legendary King Arthur. While surprised that she is a young woman, it doesn't change anything about his plans. He partners Saber with his wife and vessel for the Lesser Grail, Irisviel von Einzbern, to act as Saber's Master in the open while he acts from behind to win with his own methods. Saber is unaware of Avalon, and it is given to Irisviel without her knowledge. Saber and Irisviel arrive together in Fuyuki by plane from the Einzbern Castle in northern Europe because Saber cannot dematerialize due to her unique status. Kiritsugu travels separately from them and meets up with his protege, Maiya Hisau. Following the challenge of another Servant, they quickly encounter their first opponent that night. Saber engages Lancer, and despite a mostly even fight, she is left with a wound from Gae Buidhe to her left hand that prevents her from utilizing her full strength and Excalibur. Their fight is interrupted by the Rider, who declares the supremacy of his kingship and an invitation to join his army, but Saber claims her own kingship as a reason to never bow before another lord. The arrival of Archer, who claims that his own rule far exceeds their own, and Berserker, who takes an interest in Saber after battling Archer, confuses the situation even more. After Lancer is forced to battle alongside Berserker to kill Saber through a Command Spell, Rider interrupts that fight so that she and Lancer may properly finish their duel at a later time. All of the Servants then retreat for the night without any further battle. Saber and Irisviel encounter the deranged Caster on their way to Fuyuki's Einzbern Castle, and he mistakes her for Joan of Arc due to a slight resemblance in their appearances. While she manages to drive him off, she in unable to convince him of his mistake and he promises to save her soul from the curse of God. After Kiritsugu attempts to kill Lancer's Master, Kayneth Archibald El-Melloi, to remove the handicap caused by the wound left from Lancer, both he and Caster plan separate attacks on the Einzbern Castle. Saber, while discussing strategies with Kiritsugu and Irisviel, starts to become disgusted with Kiritsugu's attitude toward the Holy Grail War, such as his action of attacking Kayneth when she already has a planned duel with Lancer and avoiding Caster so another Servant can kill him instead. Caster shows up soon after, and he taunts Saber by slaughtering a number of children. Saber quickly goes to meet Caster in battle, and she finds that she cannot overcome his Noble Phantasm, Prelati's Spellbook, without the use of her hand. While she slaughters a multitude of his monsters, she is unable to close the gap on him at all. She is eventually met by Lancer, Kayneth having sent him to deal with Saber while he deals with Kiritsugu, and he decides to help her out of the honor of their promised duel. Acting as her \"left hand\", they eventually manage to drive Caster back using Invisible Air to create a slip stream for Lancer to make a direct charge through the horde. After Caster flees, Lancer senses that Kayneth in danger after his loss to Kiritsugu, and Saber lets him leave due to their chivalry. After the battle, Saber saves Irisviel by inadvertently providing Avalon with energy after she had received a fatal wound from Kirei Kotomine. Kiritsugu goes out on his own after everything settles down, leaving Irisviel and Saber alone in the castle. Their peace is quickly interrupted once again by the arrival of Rider on Gordius Wheel, who, rather than fighting, proposes a \"battle without bloodshed\", one of words between kings, to see who is suitable of obtaining the Holy Grail. Battling with wine, they, and Archer who Rider invited while on his way to the castle, discuss their methods of ruling and kingship. In the King's meeting, Saber expressed that she wanted the Holy Grail to change the history of her country's destruction. On the final day of the Holy Grail war, Saber encountered Berserker and fought against him. She realize that Berserker knows Saber's identity from their previous lives after catching Excalibur despite its invisibility. Saber demanded Berserker to reveal himself, Berserker answered by drawing Arondight and canceling his black fog. Saber was devastated as she learns Berserker's identity was her trusted friend Sir Lancelot. Rider's words haunt Saber as Berserker attacks Saber, causing her to believe that Lancelot's hatred towards her has driven him into madness. As Kariya ran out of magical energy, Berserker stopped his attack and Saber used this opportunity to stab him. Saber apologizes as she desires the Holy grail to change the past including Lancelot part. Berserker regained his sanity as his contract with Kariya ended, he wanted Saber to punish him because he was unable to forgive himself for falling in love with the Queen. As he fades away, Saber wanted to say that he was a loyal knight but could not find the right words. He felt that Saber was the greatest amongst king for those who served her. After Berserker's defeat, she is determined to win the Holy Grail so she can save her people and Lancelot. Saber found the Holy Grail but she also meets Gilgamesh who was waiting for her. He proposes that she becomes his wife and easily incapacitates her. Saber refuses as the Holy Grail is just in front of her. Kiritsugu arrives at this time and Saber asks him for the power of the command seal in order to defeat Gilgamesh and claim the Holy Grail. Much to her despair, Kiritsugu uses his last two command seals for her to destroy the Grail. Excalibur is used to destroy the vessel of the Holy Grail, but its contents spill out onto the earth, razing the land permanently and killing almost everyone caught in its mud. With the Grail gone and unable to maintain her form, Saber is sent back to the battlefield of Camlann, as she remembers the words of Lancelot and Rider. She was the sixth and final servant to perish in the fourth Holy Grail War. Her only wish is to redo her life so that she would never become king.Fate/stay night  Saber is summoned in the Fifth Holy Grail War as the Servant of Shirou Emiya after he has been pursued home by Lancer, who has come to kill Shirou again after being revived by Rin Tohsaka's pendant. He had been having dreams of Excalibur in the days leading up to the start of the Holy Grail War after receiving his Command Spells due to the Grail having decided that Saber would be summoned. Avalon, reacting with Shirou's mana flow, caused the image of a \"sword\" to manifest in his subconscious. While attempting to escape from Lancer, he stumbles into his shed which contains the traces of the magic circle established by Irisviel during the previous war. With both the catalyst, Avalon inside Shirou, and the circle, the summoning is complete. After Saber quickly commences with the formalities of finalizing their contract, she engages Lancer. She manages to keep the upper hand with Invisible Air until he utilizes Gae Bolg. She avoids his unavoidable attack allowing her to survive with a large wound and figure out his identity. He withdraws afterward due to orders from his Master, and Saber heals herself to the best of her ability with the lance's curse affecting the wound. Upon sensing more enemies, Rin and Archer, she quickly goes to engage them. At this point, the game splits into three routes, depending on previously cleared routes.Fate  In the Fate scenario, she is the main heroine, servant protagonist and the love interest for Shirou. With their contract, they share visions of their past. Saber learns through them that Shirou is the adoptive son of Kiritsugu and his personality changed from the time she fought for him. It is eventually revealed that in the end of the Fourth Grail War, Saber only managed to destroy the physical form of the Grail. Saber still had the view that Kiritsugu was a cold and selfish person regardless of anything and her perception of him only worsened after he forced her to destroy the Grail without bothering to explain beforehand. However, her opinion changes after realizing that after the fire Kiritsugu saved Shirou and taught him his philosophies and ideals. Shirou convinces Saber that she should accept her life for what it is rather than wishing to change her life. Saber realizes that changing her fate is a cowardly wish unlike Shirou, who was brave to keep going after being on the verge of death. She decides to accept her past and move on and with the help of Shirou, she fights to destroy the Grail. She used Excalibur to destroy the Holy Grail and its contents. After the destruction of the Holy Grail, Saber professes her love for Shirou and they bid farewell to each other. Saber vanishes to her original time, she finally accepts her past without the wish to change it thus breaking the contract with the world. She weakly smiles and tells Sir Bedivere:  \"I think I will sleep much longer this time...\" After her death, she goes to Avalon rather than being removed from the cycle of transmigration to be placed on the Throne of Heroes like other Heroic Spirits. The bonus \"Last Episode\" shows Shirou reuniting with Saber in Avalon.Unlimited Blade Works  In Unlimited Blade Works route, she is stopped from attacking Archer when Shirou uses a Command Spell to stop her. As a result of Archer not being injured, her fight with Berserker is more advantageous than in the other routes. However, before she can fight him further, Saber is saved by Shirou from Archer's Caladbolg. The next morning after explaining the rules of the Holy Grail War to Shirou, Saber decides to investigate his school for any potential dangers, where she encounters Kuzuki. Saber later goes to Ryuudou Temple at night to save Shirou, but she is unable to enter temple due to Assassin. She then takes Shirou, who has been seriously injured by Archer, home while Assassin defends them from Archer after he decided to let them go. Saber is later summoned by Shirou's Command Spell to his School to aid him and Rin against Shinji and Rider. However, She unexpectedly encounters Caster instead of Rider, and ends up arguing with Archer that Rider died with honor by protecting her Master. Saber later confronts Kuzuki and Caster when Shirou and Rin decide to ambush him to ascertain him as a Master. However, while Caster's spells are useless against her, she is surprisingly overhelmed by Kuzuki, who ends up defeating her. She later tags along on Shirou and Rin's date, where she participates in the activities during it. However, they come home to Taiga being held hostage by Caster, who Saber tries to cut down her but is stopped by Shirou's Command Spell. Seizing the opportunity, Caster stabs Saber with Rule Breaker, stealing her contract with Shirou. She is then commanded by Caster to kill Shirou and Rin, but she resists the command and tells them to run. Saber is then held captive in Caster's new base, the Church, where she resists Caster's constant torture. After Archer killed Caster and Kuzuki Souichirou, Archer claims he planned all this so he can be free to kill Shirou. This prompts Rin to form a contract with Saber to protect Shirou from Archer, who ends capturing Rin. Confronting Archer at Einzbern Castle, Saber witnesses the fight between Shirou and Archer while she allows Lancer to save Rin. Afterwards, Saber decides to destroy the Holy Grail with Shirou and Rin after Gilgamesh explained the Grail's corrupted nature. However, she ends up unexpectedly fighting a fading Assassin instead of Gilgamesh, as Rin had intially planned. She is able defeat him, and arrives just in time to save Shirou from Gilgamesh. Deciding to let Shirou fight Gilgamesh, Saber goes off to save Rin from the Grail. Saber then destroys the deformed Grail with Excalibur after Rin rescues Shinji. In the True Ending, with the destruction of the Holy Grail, Saber disappears, content knowing that Rin will watch over Shirou. However, in the Good Ending Saber becomes Rin's familiar after destroying the Grail, deciding to live alongside her and Shirou in the Emiya Household. She entrusts Shirou with providing her an answer someday about whether her path was wrong or not.Heaven's Feel  In the Heaven's Feel route, the first three days are the same as the Fate route, but the damage Saber receives from Berserker does not weigh heavily on Shirou's mind. After Saber gives her the explanation of the basics of the Holy Grail War, the topic of Illya and the Einzberns is brought up. Saber contemplates on explaining due to Shirou's confusion over Illya's hostility, instead telling Shirou to seek out the answers from Kotomine Kirei even though she wishes to have little contact with the priest. This line of conversation leads to the revelation of her connection to Kiritsugu in the previous war and her reason for disliking Kirei as a former enemy Master. Despite her dislike, she firmly believes Kirei is someone who will answer any questions clearly asked of him. As they head to the church, she suggests that Shirou not reveal the same Servant was summoned twice. After he comes back out after learning the answers, Shirou finds Saber's worried reaction funny, and also causes him to wish to reaffirm their contract as allies. In the movie adaptation, Shirou isn't carried back home following the encounter with Berserker, instead he's lied on a park bench while he heals. Saber doesn't explain the basics of the war, only convincing Shirou not to endanger his life again. Shirou and Saber's visitation to the church occurs after their encounter with Rider, which follows their encounter with Berserker. There Shirou learns from Saber of her connection to Kiritsugu in the previous war, and Kiritsugu's role in said war from Kirei. After he comes back out learning the answers, Shirou and Saber properly introduce themselves, and affirm their contract as allies. Shirou and Saber decide to patrol together at night, and then give a false explanation to Taiga and Sakura about why Saber is staying at the Emiya Residence. They begin their patrols that night, and Saber senses that someone is being drained by a Servant. They come upon Rider and Shinji Matou preying upon a woman for energy. Saber quickly engages and dispatches Rider easily, but Zouken Matou appears before they can deal with Shinji. Shirou is eventually appeased with Zouken taking charge of Shinji, although Saber is reluctant to let Shirou near him due to him being inhuman. Although she wishes to continue fighting, she stays her hand to help save the woman's life, and they bring her to the church for healing. As they discuss the situation, Shirou makes a clear resolution to end the war, and Saber says that she will never betray his trust. In the movie adaptation, the encounter with Rider occurs after Shirou and Saber's encounter with Berserker while they're heading home. The woman that Rider is feeding on is Ayako Mitsuzuri. Saber doesn't say anything following Rider's defeat when Shinji is torturing Rider. She doesn't say anything about Zouken, only keeping Shirou away from him. After Shinji and Zouken leave, Shirou becomes curious about Illya's hostility, to which Saber responds that Kirei could provide the answers. Shirou decides to do just that as he carries the unconscious Ayako with him. The next morning, Saber and Shirou argue about where she should sleep and him continuing to go to school normally despite the potential danger without her being able to be by his side due to being unable to enter spiritual form. After Shirou returns home, he finds Saber with Taiga, and the discussion of their sleeping arrangements leads to a misunderstanding. They continue their patrols that night, planning to check Ryuudou Temple due to information about a Master and Servant being there from Rin Tohsaka. Saber agrees with a direct attack, but they find little upon arriving at the mountain other than Saber briefly seeing the katana of the recently killed Assassin before it fades away. As they make their way into the temple, they find Caster standing over the body of Souichirou Kuzuki. Before Saber can charge, Shirou warns her of the ominous feeling he gets from Rule Breaker, but she attacks in anger after believing Caster to have killed her own Master. Caster then regains her composure and attacks Saber, only to be easily cut down as Saber negates her spells. They decide to contact Kotomine to heal the residents of the temple and return home for the night. In the movie adaptation, Shirou and Saber do not investigate Ryuudou Temple until the movie's climax. As such Saber doesn't see Assassin's disappearing katana nor does she kill Caster as punishment for killing her own Master. The killing of both Kuzuki and Caster is instead done by True Assassin. Shirou is left sick the next day due to Rider, as Sakura's Servant, using Breaker Gorgon on him and taking his energy.Fate/hollow ataraxia  In Fate/hollow ataraxia, Saber continues to protect Shirou, though it seems their relationship has turned more towards Saber having the major control over the relationship with Shirou. She spends most of her time at Shirou's house or wandering Fuyuki, but Rider berates her for it by calling her a freeloader. Saber participates in various activities with the others in the numerous loops; Helping and spending time with Shirou, playing soccer with children, and having a contest between herself, Illya, and Sakura over who's the best little sister. Avenger is the main source of the endless loops, the loops are based on the Third Holy Grail War so he used the participants of the 5th grail war to recreate the scenes. There are two Sabers, as in the Third Grail War there were two different versions of the same Heroic Spirit, so he uses both Saber and Saber Alter as their templates. In the beginning, Saber greets Shirou when he enters the house after he woke up. Although she admires his work ethic, Saber shows due concern for Shirou's health for sleeping in the shed. After coercing Shirou to sleep in his room from now on, Saber goes with him to have breakfast with the others. After breakfast Saber discusses the restarted Heaven's Feel with the others, then afterwards decides with Shirou to patrol Fuyuki for any potential threats to their now peaceful lives. In one loop, Saber is patrolling Fuyuki with Shirou at night, and as they cross the bridge into Shinto, she reminiscenes about the first time she crossed the bridge to Shinto with Shirou and Rin. After expressing her displeasure at the poor disguise Shirou gave her at the time, The pair are suddenly fired upon by Archer. Saber deflects the first shot at Shirou's warning, which shocks he as she should've sensed it first. Deflecting a couple more shots, Saber reluctantly lets Shirou use his Command Spell to boost her abilities so she can quickly get to and klll Archer before he kills Shirou. After exchanging a few words with Archer before he dies then Shirou, Saber goes home with Shirou. In another loop, Saber takes a tour of the school, which Taiga helped set up, with Shirou as her guide. Upon entering the school grounds she is almost immediately noticed by the boys in the track team, but Kaede, Kane, and Yukika arrive to drive off the boys. After conversing with the trio, Saber has lunch at the archery range with Shirou, Sakura, and Ayako, who asks for Saber's help with Cultural Festival. Continuing the tour, Shirou and Saber run into Kuzuki, who thanks her for helping Caster with her dress-making business. Afterwards, the two arrive at the student council room, where Saber and Issei talk at length as he shares stories about Shirou's school days. At the end of the tour, the pair arrive at his Shirou's homeroom, which Saber examines contently. After being asked by Shirou about why she wanted to visit his school, Saber expresses that she wished to see what sort of life Shirou lead at school. She becomes overjoyed when Shirou suggests that she transfer to his school, which he affirms as something that both Rin and Taiga would help with. Walking home, Saber tells Shirou that she is proud that he is ending the restarted war, for he sees the value of what is gone. Continuing saying that she'll protect him until the end, Saber tells Shirou not to be sad and that no matter the end, it will not be farewell for them as they'll arrive at the future they desire. In another loop, Saber goes to the church with Shirou, where they encounter Bazett and Avenger. Though disturbed by Avenger's very existence, Saber fights him defensively to get a feel for his wild fighting style. She then breaks his blades with ease and deals what should be a fatal blow. However, Saber then feels the pain of Avenger's wound due to his use of Verg Avesta, but she able to resist it. Wishing to end the fight, Saber, with Shirou's permission, uses Excalibur against Bazett and Avenger. Unfortunately though, Bazett's Fragarach reverts Excalibur and kills Saber. In another loop, Saber decides to stay home instead of going to Ryuudou Temple with Shirou and the others to prepare for the cultural festival due to believing she would be unhelpful, despite Shirou's insistence otherwise. Eventually though she does come to the temple, much to Shirou's delight, along with Rin, Archer, and Lancer. Saber then participates in the play rehearsal for the festival, afterwards she celebrates with everyone before leaving with the other Servants. In the final loop of Fate/hollow ataraxia, Saber aids Shirou/Avenger in reaching the Grail by fending off the mysterious monsters (which were in fact leftover parts of Avenger wishing to continue the loop) with the other Heroic Spirits. She stands as the last defense against the shades, having enveloped the entire Central Building in Invisible Air to bar any entry except through the front door, which she now guards. Saber warns the monsters of their impending demise, then, after recalling visting Shirou's school, she obliterates them all with Excalibur. In her Eclipse scenario Golden bathtub Saber arrives into the bathroom completely naked, while Shirou is bathing. She join in the bath and express her intention to repay everything nice that Shirou did for her until now. After little temptation they have passionate sex.Fate/unlimited codes  Saber has three different incarnations in Fate/unlimited codes including Saber Alter and Saber Lily. Her normal form has the title Proud Knight-King\u00a0(\u8a87\u308a\u9ad8\u304d\u9a0e\u58eb\u738b, Hokori Takaki Kishi-\u014c). Saber's story follows the basic path of Fate/stay night Fate route. Saber is summoned by Shirou, and she explains the nature of the Holy Grail War. He, having nothing to wish for, finds it meaningless, and he only wishes to stop the other Masters. Saber is confused, but offers not objections to his goal. She briefly explains her own goal of selecting a new king to replace her, not caring about her own fate afterward. Shirou cannot believe such a wish is correct, but she rebukes him by saying only the Holy Grail can decide upon the worthiness of the wish. She eventually encounters Berserker, and Ilya, having knowledge of Saber's wish, says that it is not bad to cling to impossible wishes, but questions if her wish is actually just. Saber simply believes that the result of the War will decided if it is just. Ilya calls her goals purely selfish in nature, citing that the justness she had protected all that time made the world as it is in its current state. Telling Saber that there is nothing in her past to be ashamed of as Shirou has said many times, that she lived it the best way possible, Saber cuts her off and challenges them to battle. Ilya is simply sorry for Shirou for having a Servant that does not understand the Holy Grail War. Saber emerges victorious, she contemplates Ilya and Shirou's words, wondering about if that which she seeks is truly just. She later encounters Gilgamesh, claiming that he will give her the Holy Grail and her miracle by becoming his queen. She no longer needs the Holy Grail, and her wish now has nothing to do with it. Rejecting his offer, she has only come to defeat him, citing that Shirou risked everything to teach her that she did the best with her life. He also taught her to destroy the Holy Grail, as people do not require magic to make their dreams come true. Gilgamesh pledges to cleanse her of such simple views, and the two engage in battle. After destroying the Holy Grail, she will no longer be a Heroic Spirit. Believing there was no such reason to have done so in the first place, she ruminates on not seeing the simple fact that she stood by her country while her countrymen did not stand by her. She begins to fade without the blessing of the Grail, finally returning to the hill. She tell Shirou that she is grateful and that she cares for him deeply. Though her country was far from a utopia and that she could not save everyone, he told her to be proud of her accomplishments. She decides to move on from the hill with those words in her heart, bidding him farewell and hoping that his dreams will come true. Her role is very similar to Fate route in Shirou's story, Saber and Shirou discuss about their situation together. Shirou understands that he became Saber's Master, he explains to her that he has no use with the Holy Grail and his only wish was to keep innocent people from getting caught up in the war. Saber finds his plan honorable and follows his orders. In Shirou's ending, Saber destroyed the Holy Grail and fades away. In Gilgamesh's ending, Saber is slowly corrupted by the Holy Grail blackened mud when Gilgamesh forces her to submit to him.Fate/Grand Order GUDAGUDA Honnouji  Saber appears in the event under the name Uesugi Artoria. She appears just after the Chaldea group defeated Takeda Darius and Sanada Medusa, the former of whom is her rival. After Okita tells her that Takeda was just killed, Uesugi is disappointed that she wasted a journey from Kasugayama; planning take and gorge herself on Kai's food. She then decides to attack the group for their rations, but she is defeated by them. After her defeat, Uesugi complains that the only reason she lost was because she only had three bowls of rice this morning. Before disappearing, she asks if her shadow is getting thinner.Fate/Accel Zero Order  Unlike the original Fourth Holy Grail War, Artoria isn't the Servant of Kiritsugu Emiya and is instead the Servant of Irisviel von Einzbern. Before the arrival of Chaldea, she had arranged a duel with Diarmuid Ua Duibhne to be held at the wharf. Unfortunately, Artoria encounters Ritsuka Fujimaru, Mash Kyrielight, and El-Melloi at the wharf instead Diarmuid as he had been trapped by El-Melloi's Qi Men Du Jia formation. When Irisviel questions if the group are participants in the war, Artoria tells her that she no longer senses Diarmuid's presence even though he invited them. Then, to her surprise, El-Melloi reveals her True Name, and she fights the group but is forced to retreat. Later, Artoria confronts the group after Mash established a summoning circle near to the Fuyuki River. She challenges them to a fair fight, which El-Melloi is unconvinced of due to his knowledge of her serving as a decoy while Kiritsugu Emiya ambushes the enemy. However, as she continues fighting the group, Irisviel is ambushed by EMIYA but Mash quickly defends her. Hearing EMIYA wants to kill Irisviel, Artoria fights him to defend her, prompting the group to join forces to prevent ruining El-Melloi's plan. After EMIYA retreats, Artoria realizes the group never had the intention of killing her. She learns with Irisviel from El-Melloi that the group aren't enemies, and they only wish to keep her safe to achieve their goal which El-Melloi doesn't divulge. When Irisviel states her vague feeling she was meant to be killed by EMIYA, Artoria refuses to believe such a thing, and vows protect her. She also recognizes Mash's true identity, but decides not to divulge it, believing Mash should discover it on her own. With the group having saved Irisviel, she is convinced they aren't enemies. Artoria encounters the group again when they invade her discussion with Iskandar and Gilgamesh to kill the latter with Lancelot's help. However, after Gilgamesh perishes, Artoria is suddenly attacked by Lancelot due to his Master, Kariya Matou, passing out. The group help her fight Lancelot, but he is defeated by Iskandar. He warns her and Diarmuid (who joined the group earlier) that they'll been his enemies if they ally with El-Melloi, whom he now considers an enemy, before leaving. Afterwards, EMIYA returns to kill Irisviel, but Artoria defends her against him. When El-Melloi states her true Master is Kiritsugu, she reveals she is contracted with Irisviel who shows her Command Spells as proof. After EMIYA is defeated, Artoria and Irisviel learn he is a Counter Guardian from El-Melloi. They further learn the activation of the Greater Grail will end the world, and that the Einzbern's highly certain victory in this version of the Fourth war prompted the Counter Force's activation. Artoria and Irisviel, along with EMIYA, then decided to join the group, and go with them to the the Greater Grail's cavern. At the cavern, Artoria and Irisviel learn of the Grail's corruption from El-Melloi, and he tells the group of his initial plan to safely dismantle the Grail. However that plan was changed with the failure of recruiting Iskandar, so the plan was changed to destroying the Grail directly. After defeating Hundred Faced Hassan, the group move on to Grail's chamber, where they encounter and defeat Iskandar. After he disappears though, El-Melloi is severely wounded by Lancelot, who is now contracted with Zouken Matou, and the group fight and defeat him. Unfortunately his defeat begins the Grail's activation, and Zouken uses Irisviel's magical energy to hasten the process. A figure resembling Irisviel called Black Iri emerges the Greater Grail, and proceeds to devour Zouken. She then goes to devour the group, saying five Heroic Spirit aren't enough to fill her. Artoria and Diarmuid decide to hold her off while the others escapes. Although Irisviel is concerned for her, Artoria assures her a Servant can instantly withdraw via Command Spell as long as their Master remains safe. Unfortunately, she and Diarmuid struggle against Black Iri, but thankfully the others return to assist. she is able recognizes Waver Velvet (who joined the group) has become a Servant, which unbeknowst resulted from becoming Zhuge Liang's temporary vessel. After the group destroy Black Iri, Artoria bids the other farewell, glad the battle ended well before disappearing due to the Grail's destruction.Chaldea Summer Memories ~Soothing White Beach~  While she and several other Servants prepare to rayshift with Ritsuka, Artoria and Sc\u00e1thach ease Mash's worries about the dangers they may encounter. The group arrive on an unknown island unable to contact Chaldea, which Artoria assures isn't Britain due to the tropical plants. After defeating a group of giants crabs, she reconfirms to Mordred their current location isn't Britain while the others discuss the same subject. The next day, the group learn from a near dead Blackbeard (who was convinced earlier by Mary Read to observe the island) that their location is still unknown, and its nearly impossible to leave with a normal ship. After he disappears, while others are complaining about the heat, Artoria suggests to Mash and Sc\u00e1thach possibly leaving the island for a new location where they can reestablish contact with Chaldea. Agreeing with her suggestion, the group decided to build a ship capable of leaving the island. When monsters arrive, Artoria reprimands Mordred for wearing heavy armor to intimidate her opponents when she complain how hot it is in the armor. She tells Mordred to change her armor to one suiting of her frame, but also tells her it won't bring her reputation as knight above negative. After slaying the monsters, the group's Spirit Origins are altered by Sc\u00e1thach to give them swimsuits in order to accommodate with their current environment. Artoria deciding she needs a more appropriate weapon for her swimsuit, pulls out a water pistol she apparently still had from Waku Waku. Monsters then approach, which Artoria sees as an opportunity to see if she and the others can still fight in their swimsuit. After the monsters are slain, the group go to gather materials for Sc\u00e1thach to build their escape ship while also building other facilities. Later, the group discuss what their first task of island life should be when a storms suddenly rolls in. They enter a small cave spotted by Mordred to escape the rain, but they run out due to a massive swarm of bugs. Outside the cave, Artoria is concerned another storm could happen anytime due to the island's unstable weather conditions. Out of concern for Ritsuka, the group decide they need to build a cabin to take shelter in. When Tamamo-to-Mae and Kiyohime suggest building a wooden cabin, Artoria accidentally insults them by comparing their suggestion to a stable. Apologizing for her unintended insult, she suggests a stone cabin for stability and defense. If the stone cabin is built, Artoria tells Ritsuka they may someday build a castle rivaling Camelot. She begins telling of Camelot's past before it was her castle, but stops herself, believing it to be inappropriate given their situation. She then takes back her comparison to Camelot from earlier as the island isn't Britain and Ritsuka isn't King Arthur. She assures Ritsuka that if they build a castle on the island, it will a proud and noble place like them. Next, the group decide to build a water supply to preserve any fresh water they collect. Artoria becomes surprised when Anne Bonny states a rumor of faucets that produce orange juice or udon broth. if the faucet that Anne and Mary suggested is built, she wants to confirm the rumor Anne said, and becomes overexcited when she mentions udon dashi. Familiar with udon, she then praises it as the epitome of exquisite yet simple looking cuisine. She then decides to check if the faucet produces udon broth, but become disappointed when she realizes Ritsuka tricked her. Later, Artoria joins Ritsuka, Mash, Anne and Bonny in hunting with C\u00fa Chulainn), which she calls a knight's hobby. She claims she won't let any prey escape her, and says it would be perfect if horses Llamrei and Dun Stallion along with her dog, Cavall, were with her. Artoria then prepares to unleash Excalibur to get a deer C\u00fa Chulainn spotted on leeward of a nearby mountain, but she is stopped though. Reprimanded by C\u00fa Chulainn, she explains destroying the surroundings as one way to get at prey when they hide in difficult places. She assures though that she doesn't always use it, only using it when she needs to. Artoria then asks C\u00fa Chulainn if she is somehow breaking Celtic hunting etiquette, to which he answers her method goes beyond simple etiquette. She recalls Agravain praising the aforementioned method when they went hunting together, but questions if he was lying to her. After the group ban the use of Noble Phantasms, they proceed with hunting, with Artoria catching several birds and rabbits. Deciding they've gathered enough food for now, she asks why C\u00fa Chulainn didn't participate, to which answers he sniffed out bigger prey. After slaying the wyverns that appeared, the group return to the beach to barbecue and eat the meat they've gathered; Artoria considers barbecue to be a sloppy cooking method though. Tired of barbecue, the group decide to build a proper cooking facility. Artoria compares the choice of what cooking facility to make to choosing what troop gets reinforcements, where two will be sacrificed if one is chosen. She claims she'll have to make the choice, but Mash corrects her that Ritsuka will do so. As well, she remains indecisive between the choices of hearth, pizza oven and a big cauldron as she finds the respective food options to be all delicious. Either way, she supports whatever choice is made, and eats with Ritsuka, Mash, and the choice's respective requester. Next, the group decide to build a bathing facility. Artoria requests they build a proper bathing facility, which Marth agrees with. If her request is chosen, she and Martha test the bath. Martha asks her why she requested a japanese-style bath even though she's the king of Britain. Artoria answers that bathing in it gives her vague flashbacks from when she was a main heroine in reference to Fate/stay night. Feeling she was meant to be with the bath, she suddenly imagines Medusa bathing in it as well in reference to Fate/hollow ataraxia. Later, the group decide they need to cultivate a vegetable field for a more stable food supply. If Mordred's request for a watermelon garden, she gets into a watermelon splitting competition with Sc\u00e1thach. Her competitive nature gets the better of her though, and she ends destroying the watermelon's surroundings after splitting it with her Mana Burst. Later, the group build a grain field which can be used for cooking ingredients. Afterwards, they build a ranch to raise livestock; Artoria happily accepts whatever choice is made. If a cattle ranch is built, she smacks Mordred for trying to steal her meat while its cooking, saying Mordred does her usurper name justice. if a sheep ranch is built, she mentions how Romulus was sheperd, which makes the others imagine him as one. A couple days later, Artoria, Mordred, Kiyohime, and Marie learn from Sc\u00e1thach that their crops were destroyed by a beast as determined by Fionn mac Cumhaill's use of Fintan Finegas. Unfortnuately, they find Fionn and Diarmuid Ua Duibhne, who served as lookouts the previous night, fatally wounded. Fionn quickly dies, but Artoria is able to get Diarmuid to reveal their attacker to be a boar. After he disappears, she spots a boar piglet. Marie defends the piglet, but Artoria tells her they've no choice but to suspect it given the current evidence, and not to be fooled by appearance. She warns her to be beware of a boar's charge when Marie tries to feed the piglet some nuts. She continues the group should surround the piglet and finish it off. After killing monsters that appeared, Artoria has the group split up and search the island for the boar piglet that ran off earlier. Later that night, they reconvene at their crops joined by Tamamo, Martha, and Anne and Mary. The group find the piglet along with two trying to protect from the crops when a demon boar appears. Realizing it to be true culprit, the group fight the demon boar. Artoria finishes it off, but she hears it say \"Arthur\" before dying to her surprise. She then apologizes to Marie for not believing in her that the boar piglet was innocent. After Sc\u00e1thach contracts the piglets to guard the crops, Artoria apologizes to the boar piglet for chasing it for a crime it didn't commit. She praises the piglet for its bravery against the demon boar despite its small size. Unfortunately though, she causes the piglet to run away when she mentions how looking at it makes her hungry, which Marie reprimands her for. Artoria warns though that given the island's size more demon boars may be encountered. The next day, Artoria proposes the group build a new pathway to help improve their efficiency in procuring materials. She disagrees with Tamamo's proposal for a wooden path instead proposing they build a cobblestone path. If the cobblestone path is built, Artoria praises the roads in Camelot while admitting the roads in Rome are also nice. She continues Nero Claudius and Gaius Julius Caesar would do the same, though neither can be better than the other regardless of national pride. She then becomes somber when she states how patriotism clashing can cause not easy to resolve situations. Deciding to return to camp, she mentions how stone roads remind her of knights returning home on their horses. Later, the group build an aqueduct to improve their efficiency in storing water. If Marie's request for a stone aqueduct is built, Artoria notes how it has a roman design to it when Mash compares it to Pont du Gard. She then tells Ritsuka she respects other cultures, but advises against favoring a specific culture as unnecessary friction may raise between their Servants of differing cultures. When she thinks Ritsuka isn't listening to advice, she wonders if she should something British to be built. Next, the group decide build a bridge to make travelling easier for Ritsuka. Admitting Japanese Bridges are beautiful, she believes they'd be fragile, and proposes they build a drawbridge with a stone gate for defense. if the drawbridge is built, Artoria recalls how in her past, she and her destroyed many a bridge repelling Picts, Saxons, bandits, and insurgents only to rebuild them again. She glad though that with a drawbridge she no longer has to face such a problem. As she admires the bridge's beauty though, Mordred ends up scratching it with Prydwen. Angered at her for scratching the bridge and not admitting fault, Artoria asks Ritsuka for permission to release Excalibur, comparing Mordred to driftwood. Later, the group build a garden. Afterwards they decide to build a place for recreational activities. Stating how sports can have a positive impact on both mind and body, Artoria proposes they build a athletic field given her experience in sports. If the athletic field is built, she plays a one on three game of soccer against Ritsuka, Mash, and Cath Palug. When asked by Mash if she always liked soccer, Artoria answers she hasn't, and that she must have practiced it somewhere before yet is unable remember anything else. Seeing Mordred bouncing a ball against a wall by herself, she believes her to be like a child desiring to practice alone in silence in hopes of making into the majors one day. Seeing Mordred bouncing a ball against a wall by herself, she believes her to be like a child practicing alone in hopes of making into the majors one day. Somewhat reluctantly she allows Mordred to join Ritsuka's teams, telling her not to hold back. After finishing a game of beach ball, Artoria tells Tamamo and Marie to remember their duty as Servants when they go to relax. Later, the group build a tower to overlook the isldand. Next, they decide to expand their cabin; Artoria agrees with Marie's request for a castle. If the castle is built, she notes how it is a small yet good castle, but worries about Heracles lurking around. When Marie and Tamamo speak of their experiences with castles, Artoria agrees with Marie's assessment that a smaller castle can strengthen the bonds with the people. She then calls the king and the others along with herself to be their knights, and prays their unity will be like a family. If the samurai residence is built, Artoria finds it nostalgic and soothing, and she suggests filling the storage shed with broken junk to make it more soothing in reference to the Emiya Residence. Eventually, the group decide a build a statue, though Artoria doesn't see the point of it. However, as they prepare to build it, a giant demon boar appears, and the group along with the men fight it. After the giant demon boar retreats, Artoria states it shouldn't bother them for a while given its wounds. Eventually, the construction on the escape ship is completely when the giant demon bear attacks again despite its wounds. The group then fight it to protect the boar piglets, and Artoria asks herself how can she be a king if she doesn't fight for the people. However, the giant demon boar's stamina proves to be tremendous, and it charges at the ship to destroy it. The group are able to make it to the ship thanks to the boar piglets protecting it. After defeating the giant demon boar, the group and the men board the ship and set sail, with plenty of food personally procured by Artoria.Chaldea Heat Odyssey ~Evolving Civilization~  As the group continue to sail, Artoria apologizes to Sc\u00e1thach for Mordred's rudeness, and asks her if something is bothering her. She then admires Sc\u00e1thach's belief in C\u00fa Chulainn's strength to survival when Mash mentions the men fell overboard. Eventually, the group make landfall to find a desolate wasteland. Artroria depressed by the complete lack of food, but she is more concerned about Ritsuka dying of malnourishment. The group then hear a cry for help, and are surprised it is coming from a boar piglet. After defeating the Shadow Servant chasing the boar piglet, it reveals itself to be a demon boar in disguised. The boar piglet then calls the group goddesses, and asks them to save this world. Later, led by the boar piglet, the group find the ruins of a city. Artoria points out the boar piglet speaks as if it never met humans before, and is concerned it may be too late to save this world given the ruins. Eventually, the group guided to the boar piglet chief who thanks them for saving his grandchild after hearing their circumstances. They become shocked when they learn the buildings were from an advance civilization built by the boar piglets. Unfortunately that came to an end with the arrival of the demon boars and Shadow Servants fifty years ago. The group then learn from the chief of a legend in his clan about nine goddesses called Nine Sisters who gave the boar piglets civilization. The goddesses were said to take human form, so the chief's grandson assumed the group were them. The group decide to redevelop the island in exchange for the boar pigelt's help. When the chief's description of a tenth goddess who eat boar piglet matches Tamamo, Artoria tries to comfort her. She tells Tamamo that her being summoned as Servant is because she changed her way. She then calls Tamamo her comrade regardless of how many big piglet she may have eaten while also wondering if the boar piglets were delicious. Later, the group start to rebuild the boar piglet's civilization, with Artoria being involved in the construction of a restaurant. While concerned by the piglet's suggestion of hamburger, beef bowl, or kebab shop, she wonders where the meat is going to come from. When Mordred says she's going with Sc\u00e1thach's search party to the coast for chance to surf, Artoria says she'll double her workload when she returns. Eventually, she learns from Ritsuka, Mash, Sc\u00e1thach, Tamamo, Marie, and Mordred that their current location is actually the same island from before 2,000 years later. The group realize they are the Nine Sisters the boar piglet chief spoke of. They decide against leaving the island by ship again as Sc\u00e1thach points another thousand years may pass on the island and the boar piglets may be extinct. The group then decide they need to discover why the island's space-time is distorted as they continue to redevelop the island and make contact with Chaldea. They also meet with C\u00fa Chulainn, who recently returned from being tossed overboard from the group's ship. Later, she learns from Ritsuka, Mash, and C\u00fa Chulainn that Berserker (Fate/Grand Order - Beowulf) is on the island but as an enemy. She also calls Mordred a thug when she calls Beowulf a thug. Later, the group decide to build a bridge, and if the red bridge is built, Artoria and C\u00fa Chulainn will find it familiar. After building three amusement centers, the group search for the Caster that gave the boar piglets electricity 200 years ago. Artoria and Mordred join Ritsuka, Mash, and Sc\u00e1thach in searching for the cave where the Caster is sleeping. As they continue to search for the cave, Artoria wonders if the Caster could've survived for more than a century, to which Sc\u00e1thach answers the island doesn't follow the laws of time. Nearing the cave, the group fight the demon boars surrounding it. Inside the cave, they encounter even more demon boars. Artoria defends Mash's natural good nature from Mordred's critcism by comparing Mash to pristine water while comparing Mordred to a cheap, chaotic cocktail. She then gets into an argument with Sc\u00e1thach about the balance between order and chaos. After slaying the demon boars, Artoria and Sc\u00e1thach apologize to each other for their behavior. The group then encounter an unknown Servant, and fight him along with his robots. After defeating the unknown Servant, he's reveal to be Thomas Edison who just woke from cryo-sleep; Artoria is enamored by his lion visage. The group then follow Edison outside when he learns the boar piglets' civilization he helped create is in ruins. Artoria doubts though he is Edison as his current face doesn't match the picture of him she's seen. Deciding check for herself personally, she painfully pulls on Edison's face. Returning to the city, the group learn Edison requires the Holy Grail to build an escape device to contact Chaldea. Later, Artoria with Ritsuka and Mash goes to a cave the boar piglets found. Inside the cave, she recalls it as the same cave she viisited with Ritsuka, Mash, Marie, and Anne and Bonny 2,000 years ago. Remembering, she and Anne destroy a icicle that nearly fell on Marie when she was pondering which path to take. The group then split up, with Artoria and Anne deciding to see which one can reach the end of either path. As Anne and Mary aid each other in the other path, Artoria admires their teamwork as true partners. She then states the Knights of the Round Table were indeed trusted comrades, but they were knights and she their king. Asked by Ritsuka if she wanted a partner, Artoria answers she was observe what she odesn't have, saying a king doesn't desire a partner. She then wonders if, in another time and another world, she had someone who fought by her side as a partner would. She then realizes Ritsuka could become her partner for whom she can build a trusting relationship. After comforting Mash by saying they're all partners, Artoria and the others reach the end of the path. There her competitive nature causes her to claim herself as victor of her competition with Anne as the tip of her gun entered the area first. The group then fight two demon boars that were inside the cave, which retreated after being defeated. In the present, the group encounter those same demon boars disguised as Anne and Mary separately. Upset that the demon boars copied the pirates due to numbers even though they're one Servant instead of her who's stronger, Artoria fight them with the others. After the demon boars are slain, she is glad Ritsuka understands that she is the best Servant. Some time later, the group build a tourist attraction. Next, the boar piglets request the construction of an automated machine so they can remain lazy, which Artoria and Kiyohime both criticize. If the robot factory is built, she says the boar piglet's laziness is giving her a headache. If the wish-granting device is built, she ponders destroying it, but reconsiders when she realizes the boar piglets will likely use it only to aid their laziness. Eventually, the group decide to go to where the demon boars reside as they likely have the Grail. As they near their destination, Artoria points out a vast number of demon boars guard the cave as Sc\u00e1thach surmised. She realizes the Grail must be inside the demon boars' cave, but they outnumber the group. Going with Mordred's plan, she helps breakthrough the enemy line and hold them off so Ritsuka, Mash, Sc\u00e1thach, and Edison can enter the cave. After the escape device is built, Artoria learns her old enemy, Twrch Trwyth was the cause of the island's crisis, and blames herself it. Sc\u00e1thach tells it isn't her fault while the piglets tell her they can share the blame, which doesn't exactly make her feel better. The group prepare to leave the island, and contact Chaldea and rayshift back. Artoria implores the boar piglet chief to build a lasting, peaceful country. The group are then contacted by Romani who reveals they were only gone for a hour, and return to Chaldea.Interlude  A Reason to Fight is her first interlude. She requests to visit Fuyuki, and is horrified by the destruction caused as a result of the Singularity manifesting. However, monsters attack the group when she and Romani Archaman are explaining the differing aspects of Heroic Spirits to Mash Kyrielight. Afterwards, Saber talks about the circumstances of her birth, and her past as King Arthur. She continues that despite her life being full of mistakes and failures, she was ultimately satisfied with it nonetheless. Saber then admits she hurt many and failed to recognize many, but she's proud to have protected what she held dear until the end. After killing some more monsters, Saber reveals she became king to fight for and protect the future like Ritsuka Fujimaru is now; a future that everyone wishes and desires for. She continues that while she is unsure if she did a good job, she did her best regardless. Asked by Mash if she regrets the way her life ended, Saber answers that while she has frustrations about it but has no regrets about it. She admits her battle wasn't the correct salvation for everything, but she's certain it wasn't a mistake. Awakening the Holy Sword is her second interlude. Visiting a deserted area in the Septem Singularity, Saber summons several monsters using a disposal grimoire given to her by da Vinci, in order to improve Ritsuka's strength to strengthen her Noble Phantasm. After several battles, she states that she is proud of Ritsuka, and says that she feels like this has happen before. She then wonders if she'll meet someone like Ritsuka again, a Master worthy of her respect and fondness, who rises to the occasion despite his own inexperience.Fate/Labyrinth  Saber initially appears as Manaka's Servant during the Subcategory Holy Grail. Together, they defeat many opponents as well as the bosses of each of the floor levels in Caubac Alcatraz's labyrinth. After forming a party with Archer, Assassin and Caster, they come across a bath where Manaka and Caster take the opportunity to grope her as they are bathing. Finally, reaching the end of the 3rd level, Saber helps the group defeat the 3rd level boss, a dragon golem. However, after the dragon is beaten, Saber becomes shocked to see Manaka transforming into Norma Goodfellow (due to Manaka being pulled back to her reality by the Beast Class Servant) at the entrance to the 4th floor. However, before Saber can ask Norma any questions, Norma ends up activating and falling through a pit fall trap which automatically closes on her. Although Saber is able to see Norma's whereabouts through a mental image passed to her by Norma due to her existing contract with Manaka/Norma. Despite some initial disagreements with the other Servants about Manaka, Saber and the rest of the party decide to keep on going, eventually finding the room that Norma fell into. During the walk, Caster postulates that Saber's contract with Manaka is fading. Inside the crystal room, Saber and the other two Servants encounter a two-headed dragon golem. After a lengthy battle, they are able to defeat the defeat through the use of Saber's Noble Phantasm. But, this comes at the price of Saber using up the last of her prana, proving Caster's theory. Before fading away and after saying her goodbyes, Saber gives the other 3 Servants a bracelet mystic code that she had found, and tells them to give it to Norma/Manaka.Capsule Servant  Saber makes several appearance in Capsule Servant. There are six playable Saber in the Capsaba Servants, one is known as the regular Blue Saber while the others are Saber Alter, Zero Saber, Hungry Saber\u00a0(\u306f\u3089\u307a\u3053\u30bb\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc, Hara Peko Seib\u0101), Saber Lion and King Saber. In the story mode, she appears as Master Artoria. She also appears as Galactica Saber, a super-rare Servant specially drawn by Takeuchi Takashi. Leysritt tells Shirou that by collecting all the Saber editions from limited-time Servant draws, there's apparently a rare chance of drawing Galactica Saber Final Edition. Gilgamesh has this servant in his possession in Shirou's ending in Celebloomers ending. Gilgamesh spent the entirety of his treasury on collecting many super-rare Servants. He hug it every night while he goes to sleep.Chibichuki!  Saber and many of the Type-Moon characters were transported to Katatsuki school\u00a0(\u578b\u6708\u5b66\u5712, Katatsuki gakuen) by Nasu Kinoko. Her Excalibur sword was changed to a Harisen called Exacali-harisen\u00a0(\u30a8\u30af\u30b9\u30ab\u30ea\u30cf\u30ea\u30bb\u30f3, Ekusukariharisen). She is part of the Saber 4~8\u00a0(\u30bb\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc4\uff5e8, Seib\u0101 4~8).Fate/Extella  She is a playable character for the war for the Moon Cell and an available choice for Hakuno Kishinami. She is an independent participant of the war who was summoned by the Moon Cell itself to act as a deterrent for the three factions of Nero, Tamamo, and Altera. It is her duty to ensure that the war between the three factions doesn't escalate to such a level as to cause the SERAPH's destruction. In her side story The Other Stranger, Artoria has just recently been summoned to SE.RA.PH., and muses it as an almost perfect recreation of Earth if not for the Moon Cell explaining to her beforehand. She goes to exclaim her role is to not fight for a wish, but to act as a deterrent for the recent conflicts, which she finds acceptable as she is glad to fight as a protector. She then continues to say that she must seek the cause of the abberation in SE.RA.PH., Altera, and sets out for the battlefield, believing it to be the best place to start her investigation. Later, Artoria senses a battle nearby and goes towards to where it is while exclaiming that she needs to gather information about Altera. Arriving soon at the battle she sensed earlier, she sees C\u00fa Chulainn and Medusa fighting and tells them to stop otherwise she'll have to intervene. However neither of them listen to her and attack, which prompts her to fight both of them. After defeating them, she confronted by Nero Claudius, who is confused to why she attacked both her forces and Tamamo no Mae's forces. Artoria explains to her that she serves neither side in the conflict and that she only seeks to root out the cause of the war. She then asks Nero to what compelled her to use attack programs, reprimanding her for it as they're dangerous weapons that easily lead to aberrations. She continues reprimand her by saying that battles between Servants are ferocious, asking her if she considered the poor A.I. who were swept in. Nero then realizes that her actions placed her citizens under such pain and strife, and thanks Artoria for saving her soul and her people. Hearing her words, Artoria is pleased that Nero can be reasoned with, finding her to be wise and kind, at least by the standards of a Roman emperor. She then tells her that she can be trusted to protect SE.RA.PH., and then asks her if she knows where Altera is. Nero answers that she hasn't heard of Altera, then she tells Artoria about how the war began. Arriving in a different part of SE.RA.PH., Artoria sees that Altera hasn't arrived yet, and muses about how about the Forces of Destruction haven't appeared yet either and that the only conflict for now is between Nero and Tamamo, both of whom possess the Regalia. Needing to know where Altera, she goes to ask Tamamo, and to inform her of the true threat to SE.RA.PH. even though she know little about it herself. Confronting Tamamo, she senses that she is an Anti-Hero, and prepares to fight her when Tamamo begins to speak in an evil manner. Tamamo then tells Artoria that she was mistaken for coming alone, and then goes to tell her about how she'll kill her and then she'll display her head to the masses and parade her parts across her lands as a testament to her anger. Artoria tells her that she came to obtain information on Altera, but decides to fight her for the sake of SE.RA.PH. after sensing mana on her. In response, Tamamo calls Lu Bu to her side, and Artoria proceeds to fight both of them. After defeating them, she tells Tamamo that she felt her true nature as they fought, commending her for subtly protecting her Master even in the heat of battle. She believes that her true nature to not be evil and that SE.RA.PH. is safe from her as long as her Master wills it. Tamamo tells her to kill her, but begs her not to destroy the Regalia as her Master is blameless. Artoria tells her that she has no intention to harm anyone ignorant of wrongdoing nor will she harm her. She decides to spare Tamamo, seeing that she isn't threat to SE.RA.PH. that she proclaimed herself to be. In another part of SE.RA.PH., Artoria muses about how Altera by the Moon Cell's judgement is behind the catastrophe in SE.RA.PH. She then exclaims that intuition warns her of Altera's power though not with fear or revulsion, but that same intuition warns of her of a powerful presense near her that she describing it as hating and envying the world, and mocking all human progress. Wondering what is behind the aberrations in SE.RA.PH., she continues her search with both her eyes and mind open. Eventually she encounters Gilgamesh and Iskandar, who were called by Archimedes to kill her for interfering in his plans. Iskandar asks for her name, but Gilgamesh tells him not to bother as she isn't like either of them, especially the battle enjoying Iskandar. She then decides to fight them to discipline for betraying the Moon Cell. After defeating them, a narration by Nameless reveals that her actions had prevented the conflict between Nero and Tamamo from escalating, and that she was able to weaken the forces of the Umbral Star. Later while eating at a restaurant, she tells Hakuno that Archimedes, the mastermind behind the abberation, has been defeated, but warns that he may return when it's least expected. She also reveals that she spoke with Altera, believing her to be a pure and simple yet stubborn woman. She asks Hakuno to treat Altera with an open mind should they cross paths with her again in the future, telling them that she needs a companion to confide in. Then, as admires the food she is eating after second portion arrives, Artoria expresses that she feels blessed to have come to SE.RA.PH. and that her worries of her journey are now in the far-off past.Other appearances  Saber is the main mascot character\u00a0of TYPE-MOON. She appears with her various incarnations in various promotional art.Abilities  The Saber class is considered the \"Most Outstanding\" due to its excellent ratings in all categories, and Saber doesn't fall short of that reputation. She is left very underpowered for the majority of the Fifth Holy Grail War due to Shirou's extremely bad aptitude and being unable to provide her with mana due to his Magical Paths being obstructed. She is not able to achieve the power she had during life, so she cannot be said to have the abilities of the greatest Servant in that state. She is stronger under Kiritsugu, but her luck is decreased since even Kiritsugu still could not provide sufficient Magical Energy, as a result the status was affected by the Master's way of life. After she forms a proper contract with Rin, she displays her original abilities without being affected by the Master. She can barely keep up with Berserker using all of her strength while weakened, but Shirou believes that not even he would be able to stand against her at full strength. She is also strengthened under Caster, but doesn't display it due to being incapacitated by the Command Spell. Unlike other Heroic Spirits who can fit under multiple classes, she claims that she is only suited to the Saber class. Mordred, when told that Lancer and Rider are powerful Heroic Spirits without being given their identities, considers the possibility of her having been summoned under those classes. She could possibly have the capacity to qualify for the Caster class, but \"magecraft is not the way of the King\" and she lacks the patience to actually learn magecraft. If she were to be summoned in western Europe, she would receive a general boost in power similar to other European Heroic Spirits, and she would display a much sharper increase in power in England.Combat  She is extremely skilled with a sword. Even unarmed and faced with a surprise attack from Taiga, said to be an unmatched kendo expert, Saber is able to easily disarm her without even taking a stance. She takes up teaching Shirou, but only focuses on giving him as much battle experience as possible because she does not have an aptitude for teaching others. While her ability as a swordsman is proficient, it is not where her true strength lies, but rather her enormous amount of magical energy. She believes that there is no Servant that surpasses her in close combat, and she is certain that she can clear an escape route from the battlefield under any disadvantageous situation. Her initial Noble Phantasm is always Invisible Air, allowing her to hide her identity and main weapon, Excalibur, while also confusing opponents with an invisible sword. She can also release it in a large blast of air and cover other objects with it. She eventually releases Excalibur when necessary, allowing her to unleash a large slash of light capable of wiping out almost anything it its path. She lost Avalon in life, but the genuine article still exists in the present. While it is kept from her during the Fourth Holy Grail War, it is returned during the Fate route of the Fifth War, giving her more energy and allowing her defend against any attack in combat. She also lost Caliburn in the past, and while she can no longer use it, she is able to make use of Shirou's projection to slay Berserker. Saber utilizes armor woven by her magical energy and it can be called part of her body, so it can be called forth for battle and dismissed for normal interactions. It is heavy, hard silver-white and azure armor including gauntlets, greaves, a breastplate, and long tassets shaped like a skirt that act as impregnable defenses made from magical energy overpowering others. She has to will it away manually and it doesn't fade when she is unconscious, so Rin is able to remove it from her like it is normal armor. While she normally wears a casual outfit, removing her armor during battle leaves her with a blue dress that she wears under it. Being made from her energy, it is weak against abilities that target magical energy like Gae Dearg. It cannot be permanently damaged no matter how much it is slashed, chipped, or smashed, as she can instantly repair it with her own energy. It costs a great deal to protect herself by forming, maintaining, and repairing it, so she may have to forgo healing her body to repair the armor. Maintaining her armor is the same as maintaining her body, so she keeps it off when possible to preserve her dwindling power. The cost of doing so in battle can be deadly, but it can also grant her a boost in power that proves greater than the handicap of losing it. She can dismiss it simply by cutting off the magical energy supplied to it, causing it to fade into mist as it breaks into metallic dust. She can manipulate it through psychokinesis, allowing her to impart it on objects of her choice like the Yamaha V-Max. She has a potent healing ability due to regeneration magic that automatically heals her wounds. It takes her own energy to heal wounds, so she relies on support from her Master if possible. While large, the first wound from Berserker heals in an hour, but the wound from Gae Bolg only heals on the outside and does not completely until Lancer's death due to its curse. Avalon's natural healing abilities greatly increases her healing potential, and it is able to heal her without using her own magical energy . It is not without limits, so it takes a number of minutes to recover from the backlash of Ea. She has a high level of Charisma, noted to be a rare talent, and her rank reflects her time leading her country as king. Her influence was not enough to build a grand empire on global scale, so it remained at rank B, sufficient Charisma to rule one country. While she was a guardian of the British Isles, not even her charisma could stop the kingdom from crumbling. As the natural talent to lead an army, it increases the ability of her army during mass combat. Saber is easily able to battle alongside others, and even though she and Lancer only fought once, she was able to etch all of his secret techniques into her memory after having fought with their lives on the line. They are able to understand each other without explanation, allowing Lancer to understand her skills and intentions to pull off an impromptu plan that required complete synchronization between them. She is definitely not a Servant excelling in searching for the enemy, and it is more likely she would be found by enemies while wandering about. As a Servant who can defy normal physics, she is capable of running directly up a building. She is unable to fly through the sky, but she can repeatedly kick off of the building to gain momentum. It is no different than free falling, only that she is rising until she loses her speed rather than plummeting downward. After having started, she must continue until she reaches the final destination of the rooftop. If she were to take any blows during the process, she would just fall to the ground. Such battle is so alien to her, as it is her first time engaging in an air battle as a knight who runs on the ground, that her inexperience makes her evenly matched with Rider who she normally had a great advantage over in close combat. She cannot be impeded by water due to her body having received divine blessing from the Lady of the Lake. The miracle from the blessing allows her to advance undeterred on water at full sprinting speed, which gains hardness identical to ground even while her feet splash against the surface. Command Spells allow for the temporary strengthening of Servants, enough to fill Saber's enormous circuit, allowing for the one who ruled over the battlefields in the age of legends to be reborn. While going against Command Spells brings down a Servant's abilities, their effectiveness increases with the consent of both parties, allowing them to enforce the Servant's actions and possibly support and amplify them beyond what is normally possible. This makes Spatial Transportation, magecraft close to the level of Magic, possible, and allows for Saber to perform normally impossible physical feats. Shirou commanding her to fly fills her with energy and allows her to directly fly towards Archer on top of a building four kilometers away. It uses the same principal as leaping up a vertical building, but with much more energy behind it. Using all of the energy of the Command Spell on the one action allows her to increase the distance she can jump, effectively reducing the distance to zero in an instant. She is able to match the speed of Hrunting, allowing her to kill Archer in the same instant it reaches Shirou. While she has gained knowledge on modern times from the Holy Grail, knowledge about other Heroic Spirits comes from the Throne of Heroes. She is able to recognize heroes like C\u00fa Chulainn, but is unable to know of the legend behind Gilles de Rais or Joan of Arc.Magic Circuits  Saber was born with the magical energy of a dragon, shown by the \"Pendragon\" name, as Uther ordered Merlin to grant his successor the factor of the dragon\u00a0(\u7adc\u306e\u56e0\u5b50, ry\u016b no inshi). She is the holder of the Element of the Red Dragon who carries the blood and very magical power of a phantasm in a human body, granting her a heart and unique Magic Circuits that transcend what can be achieved by normal humans and magi. Saber's Circuits are called a Magic Core, which is fundamentally different from those of a normal magus. While a magus' body can be considered a machine which creates magical energy, hers acts as a factory which creates magical energy. It functions as an enormous magical energy core with tremendous capacity that generates energy independent from her body simply through breathing like dragons. This allows for a case where she herself is so out of energy that she is unable to access the energy without a proper \"starting key\" to get the extra energy flowing. Due to the characteristics of a Dragon, she has trouble with existences such as Siegfried, who is associated with tales of culling Dragons and weapons with an anti-dragon attribute such as Arondight. The fault in her summoning caused the normal line between Servant and Master to not be connected, so she cannot replenish magical energy normally under Shirou. She is essentially limited to the amount with which she was summoned, around 1250 units of magical energy, placing her in a bad situation. It would help her even if he were only able to provide a small amount, but she doesn't receive any due to lack of a normal spiritual connection. She uses the energy of ten average mature magi just in the span of her first day. She would have to use a low amount for all of the subsequent battles, ten units assuming there was no damage, which would also place a limit on her use of Excalibur. She has to suppress her magical energy usage to the utmost to keep from fading away. She can lower the amount consumed by regularly consuming food, sleeping as much as possible, and disarming herself, as she cannot go into spiritual form to reduce the burden on her Master like other Servants. She can regenerate eight units of magical energy while subsiding on six units by being idle during the day, allowing her to save two units for later battle. The amount is inefficient, as the first battles with Lancer and Berserker cost her two hundred fifty units to protect herself and restore her broken armor. The only ways to supply her with energy would be to force her to feed on human souls with a Command Spell, or to use alternate means than the inactive spiritually connected path to provide her with magical energy. Using Excalibur a single time is enough to completely cripple her in this state. She is left unconscious and in constant pain as she fights to keep fading away. She is left in a state where she can barely run while she is awake, and she is physically on par with a weakly Shirou. It is possible to use the physical path between Saber and Shirou to provide her with energy through intercourse, as the semen of a magus is a cluster of energy. During Realta Nua, they instead utilize the great amount of undiluted magical energy within her core. It is meaningless without enough energy to start it, requiring a \"fire\" to burn in order to activate it. It doesn't matter how small it is, as it will resume activity once a path to send magical energy is connected. Shirou uses part of his own Circuits to start Saber's Circuits. Shirou travels there in an unconscious spiritual form, and encounters a dragon that takes form in Saber's unconsciousness. Shirou calls it \"an absurd 'true nature' that is appropriate for the best Servant.\" It attacks him to obtain the necessary starting energy, and once reactivated, it shows its nature as a prismatic circuit as it glows with all the colors of the rainbow and burns with a golden fire as its circulation restarts. While the energy from either act is enough to keep her from fading away and allows her to actively battle, it is not able to allow her to use Excalibur. Attempting to use it straight away brings about a very weak version of it, and she instantly fades away after its use. She later regains enough energy to use it without instantly fading away, and bolstered by Avalon, she can use it four times in a row before completely disappearing.Magic Resistance  The immense magical power from Saber's dragon blood grants her a very strong Magic Resistance that is the highest amongst the Servants, especially due to it having increased in magnitudes upon becoming a Servant. It is capable of completely neutralizing any magic that is A rank or below, including grand sorceries involving magic arrays and instant contracts not only from modern magi of the highest level but also those from the Age of Gods. She notes that divine mysteries greater than herself, such as True Magic and members of the Phantasmal Species with divinity, can overwhelm it. It is possible that it will not function to its fullest extent if she is targeted by \"Dragon-slaying Sorceries.\" Its effectiveness is enough that its rank remains unchanged at A rank under both Shirou and Rin, regardless of their differences in power and characteristics, but it does decrease one rank to B with Sakura as her Master as result of the dark alignment from her Blackening. It becomes able to only nullify magic less than three verses, but it is still able to protect against grand sorceries and ritual magic with little chance of actually damaging her. The extraordinary rank of her Magic Resistance is even able to resist an action forced onto her powered by one stroke of the Command Spell, sufficient enough to shake the very foundation of the Servant System, although only just barely. She is left in pain as compulsion and resistance clash intensely within her body from Kiritsugu's command, but she is able to use all of her strength to resist it. Under Caster's command, she is left in a state with no free will and her abilities lowered to the point where Caster can torture her with magecraft as long as she refuses to follow it. Caster believes that it will eventually infringe upon her mind enough to forcibly make her loyal within a day. She cannot handle having two used at once, so the tremendous force of dual Command Seals will ravage and crush Saber\u2019s form and resistance to make her follow the second command without being able to stop it. She cannot be directly wounded by magecraft, so she will charge in without fear to quickly determine the outcome of the battle with a slash. This is especially true against those of the Caster class, putting her at an overwhelming advantage and giving them little chance of victory should they face her directly. It is not effective against Caster's Prelati's Spellbook because Magic Resistance is only activated when someone targets her to use magecraft, and the creatures are materialized and carry a threat different from magecraft. She is able to charge through Rin's jewel powered spells, strong enough to wound and kill Servants without Magic Resistance, without pause as they instantly disappear simply from touching her, and even Caster's Age of Gods magecraft is ineffective on her to the point where even Saber looks down on her abilities. It proves to be a hindrance when protecting Shirou in \"Missing Ariadine\" after he is caught by Caster's enforced transference due to being unaffected by it. She is able to weaken it herself to allow Shirou to attempt Reinforcement on her.Mana Burst  Saber's entire fighting style and strength are based around her Mana Burst ability. It infuses and accumulates magical energy into her weapon and body, momentarily injecting an arbitrary vector that allows for an exceptional boost of her abilities by instantaneously releasing the magical energy to reinforce herself. It can be called a jet blast of magical energy to increase her movements in close combat, and executing large-scale body reinforcement through Mana Burst is only possible with her immense magical power. It would allow for even a stick to become a weapon of great power at her rank, but normal weapons without strong divine protection will not be able to endure the magical energy-fueled attack and will be destroyed with one blow. Her power increases with her available energy, so she can gain a boost in power and speed six times the energy used her armor should she convert the cost for it into her Mana Burst. She uses the magical energy for her sword techniques, guarding, and movement. Her body is naturally physically frail, and she is even weaker than Shirou and Rin should she not utilize the ability. It is the secret that has allowed her to brandish her large sword with the combat style of a power fighter, and she is able to reinforce the ability of her body to such a great extent using magical energy that she can fight head on with monsters such as Berserker even with the thin body of a small girl. Each of her powerful blows contains enough magical energy that they are visible, and if Lancer's strikes are like an accurate sniper rifle, her own can be compared to a powerful shotgun. Simply striking the enemy's weapon causes the energy to penetrate it, and it fills the area with light. She can surge it around herself to blow apart bindings like Horrors, tearing them into slivers of flesh and scattering them in an instant. She uses Mana Burst to compensate her lack in strength while wielding Excalibur with one hand after being wounded by Gae Buidhe, but it drains much more energy and she still cannot use the strength that can only be delivered with both hands. She can easily adjust her strength to match Shirou's level of swordsmanship while training him, and she can readily increase it as he also improves.Instinct  Saber has extremely honed Instincts that have gotten her through many battles, allowing her to instantly identify \"the best personal course of action\" during combat. It is a heightened sixth sense that is innate unlike something that can be gained by anyone through hard work like Eye of the Mind (True), and it is essentially in the realm of predicting the future as a form of precognition due to having been strengthened by a degree from the specialty of the Saber class. It allows for the prediction of trajectory, allowing her to avoid attacks from firearms, and along with listening to the sound of cutting air, she can be said to have a protection against all projectile weapons. It also possible to negate the penalties inflicted by visual and auditory interference to a certain extent. While she cannot actually follow the confusing strikes of Kuzuki's Snake, she is able to dodge them purely through her Instinct because surprise attacks are ineffective against her. Even if she lacks sound logic or proof, it can be used a guidance, such as allowing her to tell that goading Berserker was a fatal mistake. It alerts her to the possible danger of an enemy, such as sensing a threat from Caster even though he is a magus and feeling Berserker's presence simply from his murderous intent. Her instinctive alarm is triggered by Caster\u2019s unnatural degree of confidence even with his fragile tentacle monsters being killed, and she is able to comprehend with extreme accuracy the nature of the threat from Berserker's F-15. Despite sensing Assassin to be harmless, her instincts tell her that he has a way to seize a certain kill even without a Noble Phantasm, and they tell her not to underestimate him for giving up his high ground because his words warning her of the lethality of Tsubame Gaeshi are true. While being able to discern techniques like Lancer\u2019s ultimate technique, Gae Bolg, reflects her skill, her exceptional Instinct also helps her immensely. It allows her to turn and jump back from the attack with all her might, as if she knew it was going to happen. She is able to sense the possible arrival of certain \"divine opportunities\" for victory should she manage certain conditions. Against Tsubame Gaeshi, she is able to see a small blind spot created by the bent sword after having experienced it once before. While it allows her to see it, only her determination to follow it and charge in at Assassin without knowing if it would work allows her to defeat the skill. While it can theoretically surpass thought for a natural talent in battle decisions and it has kept her alive over the years after having been sharpened through many battles, is not an infallible ability. Lancer is able to trick her with a ploy using his Noble Phantasms, leaving her unable to predict her blunder, and while she is able to dodge many of Kuzuki's strikes through pure instinct, it eventually fails her in the end. While she is able to select the best choice and follow that view normally, she is not able to even feel a chance of victory against Gilgamesh. It is as if the probability of victory is so low and the chance of a comeback is pretty much zero.Chivalry  Saber\u2019s ability is maximally unleashed while engaging in an honorable face-to-face single combat. It is a method of battle that is full of chivalric honor, and it is also one that suits her sense of aesthetics. She does not dislike strategizing, but she tends to loath fabricated strategies that have no concrete basis due to her experience as a capable military commander. She will fine tune her strategy meticulously, and she will further adapt her actions in response to the ever-changing dynamics of combat while in battle. She naturally dislikes cowardly actions, no matter if it involves strategies or not. Her compatibility with the cool-headed, achieving-his-goal-at-all-cost Master, Kiritsugu Emiya, was the worst due to his various strategies that involved using her as a tool. She dislikes fights involving constant running and retreating, and such behavior from an opponent can only be seen as an insult to her pride as knight. Battles must determine the victor by exchanging blows with full force. While she believes Assassin is doing just that to her, he explains that the difference in their swords makes it impossible to clash directly without destroying his own. She likes the idea of withstanding a surprise attack fair and square, turning the tables to go for the kill, and reminding them that the Saber class is not about gallantry. Due to her nature, she feels inclined follow the etiquette of a knight to properly introduce herself to an opponent should they give their own name. Despite the potentially devastating effects it could have on future battles, she feels that she cannot disgrace the faith of a knight. She would never normally reveal her true name no matter what torture she were to receive, but that is only for the sake of victory that is not worth more than her pride. When fighting Lancer for the second time in the Fourth Holy Grail War, she replicates the effect of the wound to her hand left by Gae Buidhe even after it is healed. She deliberately forgoes using her left hand by tucking her left thumb into her palm, so that her fighting style is lighter and somewhat held back because the strength of the hand is not used at all when attacking. It is not actually grasping the sword, so the remaining four fingers are only lightly wrapped around for supporting the control of the sword. Her pride is not able to settle for accepting Lancer's concession of destroying his own spear, so she attempts to match him in an action of true chivalry. While Lancer is worried that they can not have a true battle under those conditions, she tells him that using her left hand in the situation would cause her enough shame to slow her sword. As it would be a fatal mistake to face him in such a condition, she feels it is the best strategy in order to put all her strength into defeating him. The extent of the injury to her hand is only of secondary importance in battle, as the most important contributor to Saber\u2019s ability to obtain victory is in her clear fighting spirit and passion for battle that has been honed to purity. The pride in her heart can be called her greatest weapon, so she would rather give up her left hand to sever any confusion in herself. She is not against receiving Kiritsugu's help in order to secure the Grail during her final battle of the Fourth War. She is fine with entrusting everything to him at that moment because it is the only way to reverse the situation with Gilgamesh at the time. She resolves herself to do her utmost to carry out his battle tactics no matter how strange. She is fine as long as she is able to retaliate against Gilgamesh, whether it involves using a Command Spell to block the sense of pain and use all her strength in an attack that may destroy her body or to undergo instantaneous movement to the side of the Grail in order to get out of her disadvantageous position and attack him with Excalibur.Riding  Saber has a very high rank in Riding because knights are soldiers proficient in mounted warfare. Chariots and normal mounts can easily be ridden, but she is unable to control Pegasi, Griffons, Dragons, and other Magical Beast and Divine Beast ranked members of the Phantasmal Species. She can not handle such high level beings because her class is not Rider, and due to the fact that she was a King in the Age of Man, she does not have the fortune of having \"Legends of Riding Phantasmal Species.\" She is able to control modern machinery like motorcycles and automobiles in a similar fashion to mounts. The Riding skill is applicable because they are treated as \"modern mounts\", but it is unclear if it is applicable to aircrafts. While the rank is B under both Shirou and Rin, it is elevated to A while having Kiritsugu as her Master. The ability allows her to completely understand the control of all ridden equipment both known and unknown to her. Even having never driven a car, she is able to make quick decisions that allow her to easily control it on her first time driving. Even if she doesn't know the actual function of a button, she is able to understand the effect it will have once pressed. She is confident in the prospect of piloting a passenger plane or any other mount by sitting on a saddle, seizing a bridle, and managing the rest with instinct. She does not have the opportunity to demonstrate her Riding ability in the Fifth Holy Grail War, but the battles might have developed differently if she were provided with an appropriate mount. She drives both Irisviel's Mercedes-Benz 300SL Coupe and a Yamaha V-Max prepared by Kiritsugu during the Fourth Holy Grail War. While she chauffeurs Irisviel around in her Mercedes, it is not suitable for battle with other Servants. Four-wheeled vehicles, while controllable, are too constraining with the driver placed into a seat while constricted by safety belts. She is unable to get a natural feel for the vehicle without the act of actually riding it. In order to maximize Saber's Riding skill and the reinforced abilities of a Servant, something two-wheeled is necessary. It becomes much easier to control if the driver is able to become part of the vehicle itself to allow them to control balance, expose them to the outside elements, and allow them to feel the internal composition as if it were an extension of their own physical body. While a Servant's dexterity is far above such machines in both terms of maximum acceleration and maximum speed, they can travel while maintaining their speed as long as they have fuel, so she can avoid wasting energy in a drawn out pursuit.Yamaha V-Max  Kiritsugu has Maiya prepare a mechanical prop more fitting for guerrilla warfare than a car in the form of a Yamaha V-Max, a powerful motorcycle likened to a \"steel lion\", during the Fourth Holy Grail War. It has a ridiculously impractical and hypothetical design that ignores the limits of normal drivers. The motorcycle body, that of a Yamaha V-Max, is already the most powerful in the modern world, and the original V4 1200cc 140 Horsepower engine that could already work near its limits was strengthened again into a V4 1400cc engine. The acceleration system is completely reinforced to make it a monstrous abnormality with an output equal to 250 Horsepower. The structure of the V-style propelling mechanism and its four-cylinder design allows it to immediately start to work as a two-cylinder design when the limit of engine rotation is reached and allows it to increase the amount of air sucked in to achieve an ultimate acceleration. It has surpassed the basic rule of a machine, the limit of \"machines are tools of men.\" It can be thought of as an alien creation born through advanced modern technology which can only show its true worth by having an inhuman Servant rider. It is a design structure that would normally never be placed on a machine using two cylinders, but it is a \"beast\" that has completely surpassed the limits of a motorcycle. It can no longer function properly as a two-wheeled design because of the various extreme reinforcements. The wheels have too much torque, and they cannot generate enough friction with the road and only keep on turning. The front wheel jumps up whenever the brakes are applied, creating enough force to throw off the driver immediately. Its deepest hidden secret and most powerful trump card lies in a button on the steering wheel. It causes a valve inside the interior of the engine to switch to automatic mode and fill with oxide fuel. The nitrous oxide expands under the high temperature of three hundred degrees Celsius and reaches the boundaries of its limits to increase the V-Max's acceleration rapidly by twofold. Saber, as a Servant, exists far beyond ordinary humans, so she is able to manage control over it with ease. Acting as her \"steed\", the speed it grants reminds her of riding a horse more than the Mercedes, and even though she is driving a creation of modern technology, riding it allows her spirit to return to the memorable battlefields of the past and regain the spirit of chivalry from a time when she had held her lance and charged towards the enemy formation. She becomes able to easily detect obstacles blocking her path through changes in the air flow, and even closing her eyes wouldn't hinder her ability to avoid collisions. She removes her armor because it would only hinder her riding, and because she is short in stature, she can only control the over three hundred kilogram, super heavily reinforced motorcycle in a precarious driving position. She is practically lying flat on top of the engine, which is covered by a plastic turbo pump, and is forced to bear the powerful vibrations of the large engine while holding onto the steering like a child desperately clinging onto the back of a beast. She has no trouble controlling the physically uncontrollable steed perfectly at full speed from that position due to her prided battle skills and Mana Burst ability. She focuses the motorcycle's horsepower entirely on acceleration, and controls it with the enormous power of her mana bursts instead of breaking. As it was completely revamped to achieve the ultimate acceleration, it has no dexterity much like cars modified to compete in high-speed short and straight courses. Her superior skills allow her to overturn the common physical rule of \"vehicles can\u2019t turn corners at high speed\", making it possible for her to open the throttle valves on tight turns to pour all of the excess torque into the back wheel. The intense acceleration would normally threaten to topple the vehicle sideways due to the front wheel starting to drift, but her explosive energy allows her to forcibly tilt it to the side in order to complete the turn. Rather than skill, it is more like using even more power to overwhelm and twist the direction of the vehicle. Despite the machinery being extremely advanced, it is unable to cope with Saber's riding for very long. It easily reaches 6000 revolutions per minute from her breakneck pace, and on its own, it is able to reach over three hundred kilometers per hour. No mater how much of her magical energy she uses, the strength of its material composition and structure are limited to their original design. Before even catching up to Gordius Wheel, the machine has fully manifested all of its ability to its greatest capacity by that point, and the engine and acceleration system already show signs of breaking down. The ability to match something transcending normality like a Noble Phantasm requires to use both her armor and Invisible Air in conjunction to reinforce it and reduce the burden. This mode is called Saber Motored Cuirassier\u00a0(\u30bb\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30fb\u30e2\u30bf\u30fc\u30c9\u30fb\u30ad\u30e5\u30a4\u30e9\u30c3\u30b7\u30a7, Seib\u0101 Mot\u0101do Kyuirasshe, Saber Motard Cuiassier). Through intense psychokinesis, she is able to fuse her own armor with the bike following a concept similar to the armor that protected beloved horses on the battlefield to turn the motorcycle into a \"magical beast\" with a hard structure befitting its extraordinarily strong horsepower. The capability of the entire bike is increased due to being wrapped in the flexible and strong sliver armor, and she constantly releases her magical energy to reinforce, cover, and protect various important parts that are able to ensure maximum speed of movement. It also increases her unity of riding by truly making it into her own limbs. The speed causes air friction that is close to approaching the force of water pressure, so she releases Invisible Air in the shape of an arrow around her to completely cover the body of the vehicle. She is able to entirely release it from air resistance by decreasing it to zero with the compression of the pneumatic umbrella. This allows it to easily reach over four hundred kilometers per hour, and due to the pressure released by the magecraft, the back wheel is firmly pressed against the cement even when making turns at full throttle. She has full control even at this speed, allowing her to easily dodge and weave through numerous obstacles while only on one wheel.Contract  Heroic Spirits are those who have been removed from the time axis and placed on the Throne of Heroes, while Saber can still be considered living. The hero known as King Arthur is not currently classified as a Heroic Spirit, so she cannot be called a complete Servant. She made a pact with the World as she was on the verge of death after the Battle of Camlann that will require her to become a Counter Guardian, a sub-category of a Heroic Spirit at the service of the World, after her death. These pacts are normally done by those requiring the power beyond ordinary humans to become heroes during their lifetimes, but her wish instead came at the time of her death because King Arthur did not require support to become a hero. Due to the fact that she could not obtain the Holy Grail during her lifetime, she could not stand not having it in her final moments when a wish appeared that she needed granted. She could not complete the search for it, so she asked the World to allow her to obtain the Holy Grail while she still lived. King Arthur will not die until she obtains the Holy Grail, also meaning that King Arthur cannot die. She should be dead according to the timeline, but the contract cannot be fulfilled if that is true. Time is stopped for her at the moment of death, so it can be said that she is stopped in time rather than that time itself is stopped. The flow of time doesn't care that she is stopped, so it keeps flowing into the present without any issues. While she is not actually a Heroic Spirit, she can be summoned as one because as long as she continues to seek the Holy Grail, it is evident that she will eventually become a complete Heroic Spirit. The result of obtaining the Holy Grail and fulfilling the contract are already determined, so she has an infinite amount of chances to claim it. This also allows her to be summoned into many ages even without being outside of time and before she became a Heroic Spirit due to the condition that her becoming one is already determined. She has no trouble staying in the world for an indefinite time during the Unlimited Blade Works good ending even though she has yet to fulfill or cancel the contract. It would not be possible to summon her if she does not seek the Holy Grail, and as she cannot be summoned unless something called the Holy Grail is present, her existence is proof of its existence. Trials to obtain the Holy Grail exist in all ages, so she will eventually obtain it as she continues to challenge each one. Continuing the search for the Holy Grail of Fuyuki as a Servant or on any battlefield where there is a chance to obtain the Holy Grail can be done as many times as she wishes. Due to the fact that she still exists within the time axis, she cannot participate in two chances to obtain the Holy Grail at once, and she cannot redo chances she has already failed. She will fail a lost attempt at the Grail no matter how many times she tries because she cannot change an already experienced result. Heroic Spirits summoned as Servants are all copies of the \"true body\" stored in the Throne of Heroes, but she had not yet reached that rank. She instead is called in the form of \"myself about to die.\" This makes her current incarnation unique among Servants because she is called from within the time axis rather than being copied from outside of the concept of time. She jumps forward or backward in time from the moment of her death, and returns to that moment upon obtaining or failing to obtain the Grail. Should she claim it, her time will flow again and she will die just as history has recorded. Should she fail, all her memories are returned to her body, and she can either continue her search for the Grail or cancel the contract should she find a reason. She originally claims that she cannot enter spirit form due to Shirou's inexperience as a magus, but eventually tells that it actually has to do with her body. Due to not having actually died, she is classified as a living being despite being handled differently as a Servant. This also allows her to keep all memories of her search for the Grail unlike Heroic Spirits that don't allow for any inconsistencies in their memories. Upon learning new knowledge, the self that learns will disappear after their duty is complete. With the exception of Archer's ability to \"read\" outside records of his actions as a Counter Guardian, Servants would normally not have any memories if they happened to be summoned in two different Grail Wars, while Saber completely retains all of the happenings of the Fourth Holy Grail War. If her wish is granted, another king will be chosen in King Arthur's place. Even after she is no more, she will still have to act as the hero King Arthur, instead as a Counter Guardian, even without a legend behind her. Purposefully destroying the Grail means also destroying her contract and ability to be summoned as a Servant. After giving up on obtaining the Grail and terminating her contract with the World during Fate, she goes to Avalon rather than being removed from the cycle of transmigration to be placed on the Throne of Heroes like other Heroic Spirits. She is still considered a person in the present among the English as the \"Once and Future King.\" She also destroys the Grail voluntarily during Unlimited Blade Works, but the contract is only halfway done rather than fully broken because it was a flawed Holy Grail and she is still unsure of herself. Since she reconsiders her life and finds her own path, it is possible she can become a Heroic Spirit on her own.Forms and Alternate Versions Swimsuit  \u201cOf course, I am under the Archer Class. What about it?\u201d \u2014Artoria Pendragon (Archer) A king of the beach that descended on the summer sea. Since all the duties as a king were left behind at the office in this occasion, she is completely adapting to the summer's sunlight. As she was not able to fully enjoy swimming due certain circumstances, Artoria was having fun with watermelon splitting at the beach when she met the water blitz (a survival game using water guns), and turned out like this by the time anyone noticed. It goes without saying that she, who hates to lose, is aiming at becoming world champion. At that day, she met her (relatively trivial) fate. The same Artoria as always, but her attention is just a little more relaxed since this is the beach. Her class representative temperament has not changed, but it goes without saying that she is more gentle than usual. In this rare vacation, it should be fine to cut loose at least this time around - such is her stance. Also, one should play at the playtime. Wherever it is games or sports, she - who hates to lose - is aiming at the seat of strongest of the Archer Class. Who said that King Arthur was a sword-only Heroic Spirit? She also uses a sword. She also uses a spear. She also uses a bow. She also rides a reindeer and makes surprise attacks on her Saber kins. As expected, wouldn't you call this an almighty combat skill befitting the King of Knight's reputation? That aside, the reason why Artoria does not swim has its cause on the protection of the fairy to \"walk on water\". While alive, she never practiced swimming since there was no need for her to swim. In other words, she cannot swim. Protection of the Beach Houses\u00a0(\u6d77\u306e\u5bb6\u306e\u52a0\u8b77, Umi no Ie no Kago) is a Personal Skill that restores HP in compensation for Noble Phantasm. While at the beach, she is revered by most food stalls as the \"king of foods\". It is probably due her lavish orders, pleasant eating spectacles, and the shining smiles after meals that cause said shop to flourish - or so it has been told. Is it really? Maybe it is. However, only mashed potatoes are a \"no, thank you\". Territory Creation is originally a Skill from the Caster Class. Also, Mana Burst (Water). A dream-like effect by means of the protection of the fairy, which boosts the morale of companions, raises LCK, raises accuracy rate, clears irritation and, on top of that, makes them refreshed. A cheat Skill in regards to survival games. By displaying this Skill, Artoria will become the champion of the world tournament of water blitz, but that is another story.Development Creation and Conception  Kinoko Nasu's original story of Fate, Saber and Shirou were opposite gender to now. Takashi Takeuchi convinced to Nasu to change the gender of Saber but the essential theme had not been changed, it's the story about legendary heroes and \"a boy meets a girl.\"Reception  Gen Urobuchi believes Saber's relationship with Shirou doesn't seem like a realistic relationship between a male and a female, but a complicated relationship with a boy who became a girl. He further explains that it is not a relationship fueled by instinct like the relationship between a man and a woman, but a romance of logic between two people who need each other from the heart. He thinks the Fate route could have been told as a story through the ancient Greek views on love. She often ranks near the top of official popularity polls, and she ranked first out of the female characters during the TYPE-MOON Fes. tenth anniversary poll.References List of unused Fate/Apocrypha Servant designs Fate/stay night  Articles related to TYPE-MOON's visual novel, Fate/stay night.Gilgamesh  Gilgamesh\u00a0(\u30ae\u30eb\u30ac\u30e1\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5, Girugamesshu), also known as Archer\u00a0(\u30a2\u30fc\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc, \u0100ch\u0101), is the Archer-class Servant of Tokiomi Tohsaka in the Fourth Holy Grail War of Fate/Zero. He later forms a new contract with Kirei Kotomine that lasts ten years later into the time of the Fifth Holy Grail War of Fate/stay night. He has an obsession with Saber during both stories. He is one of the Servants able to be summoned by Ritsuka Fujimaru of the Grand Order conflicts of Fate/Grand Order.Profile Identity  Archer's True Name is Gilgamesh, the great half-god, half-human king born from the union between the King of Uruk, Lugalbanda, and goddess Rimat-Ninsun. He ruled the Sumerian city-state of Uruk, the capital city of ancient Mesopotamia in the B.C. era. He was an ultimate, transcendent being so divine as to be two-thirds god and one-third human, and no others in the world could match him. He was a despot possessing high divinity who believed he was invincible. He is not merely a legend, and is said to have actually existed and ruled during the Sumer Dynasty five thousand years ago. He was the King of Heroes\u00a0(\u82f1\u96c4\u738b, Eiy\u016b-\u014c) who possessed all things in the world, whose tale is recorded in mankind's oldest epic poem, the Epic of Gilgamesh which portrays Gilgamesh as a hero, destined to be king and achieve great feats, who is driven to meet his destiny, facing challenges together with his best friend Enkidu. His title, King of Heroes, is not meant to call him a king who is a hero, but instead implies that he is the king over all heroes. He is mankind's oldest hero, the origin of all myths and model on which heroes are based, so his story is copied within the mythologies of all the countries of the world. The heroes of various myths are derived from his legend, so his Gate of Babylon possesses all of their Noble Phantasms. Though there are numerous kings with titles such as the King of Knights or the King of Conquerors, he is the only one in all of heaven and earth crowned with the title of \"King of All Heroes.\"Early years  Born with a body that was of the highest grade by mortal standards and knowledge reaching truth, Gilgamesh was born, designed, as king and the Keystone of Heaven between the rising humans and the fading gods. He was sent to ensure the humans and bind the earth slowly leaving the Age of Gods. He was a being embodying the two life sets of life forms, with the blood of those who had ruled and the blood of those who would rule from thereon. He was to be the ultimate neutral party able to discern their respective failings, adjudicating from their respective positions. During his childhood, he loved the gods instead of humanity, but the gods created Enkidu at that time to punish the arrogant king. Enkidu observed the young Gilgamesh, but could not understand the need to punish such an amiable, ideal king who was praised and lauded by his infatuated subjects. There could be no flaw that required correction, and the only problem was that he did not submit to the gods even if he did respect them. Enkidu was forced to admit that the gods had been correct as he watched the boy grow into a young man. Practicing absolutism, oppression, duress, levies, and the utmost decadence from self-interest, the people of the kingdom lamented the change, and even the gods were perplexed at the extent of the expected transformation. The reason was simply that he had been born with the conclusion already drawn, existing independently as a being neither fully divine or human. He acquired the characteristics of both, so his field of vision reached even past what the gods were able to comprehend. His overwhelming power bred overwhelming isolation, but his strength of self kept him from abandoning his kingship or fleeing from the mission imposed upon him. Through revering the gods and loving humanity, he decided to follow the path to its conclusion by deposing the gods and loathing humanity.Friendship  Gilgamesh encountered Enkidu for the first time outside of the Temple of Uruk, who immediately stated that he would reprimand the King and rectify his arrogance. They entered a battle that spanned several days, and Gilgamesh was forced to use all his strength to match his transforming opponent. He was either angered or surprised at having found his equal for the first time, insulting Enkidu as a clod of mud. He was forced to draw out his treasures that had been carefully stored away, marking the first use of the Gate of Babylon as a weapon, and although it was a reluctant and forced humiliation at first, he eventually began to enjoy it and brought them out without regret. He eventually emptied the vault, and Enkidu was left with only a tenth of his clay. Rather than continue, Gilgamesh let himself fall backwards onto his back while bursting with laughter, Enkidu following in suit. He remarked that there would only be one chance to strike for each of them, and without any means of defense, it would leave only two foolish corpses. Enkidu was never able to interpret if that meant it was a tie or if Gilgamesh wanted to make it so that there would only be one corpse. Enkidu asked, \"Do you not regret the treasures you have spent?\" to which he replied in a bright voice, \"Why, if it's someone I should use it on, then it's not unthinkable to do him the favor.\" Gilgamesh and Enkidu became close friends afterward, marking the one and only story of eternally unchanging worth in all the world. They worked side by side, and Gilgamesh noted that his vault started to become disordered after having begun utilizing weapons as projectiles, calling it a bad habit. Looking towards Humbaba, the guardian of the forest and beast of the gods, Gilgamesh decided to seek out and defeat it. They did so with their combined strength, but Enkidu was left confused by the action. It had not been an order from the gods, and it could not have been for his people who suffered under him. Gilgamesh told him that it was part of purging the evils of the world to protect Uruk, but Enkidu could not understand why he would care about those he tyrannized. Gilgamesh explained his way of protecting humanity, causing Enkidu to fully realize the source of his isolation. Enkidu stated that Gilgamesh took the path of observation, causing Gilgamesh to smile embarrassedly like in his childhood and speak of it. In response to his passion, Enkidu pledged himself as a tool to Gilgamesh afterward, but Gilgamesh reprimanded him, explaining to him that he was his friend. Enkidu believed it was the only time Gilgamesh had ever shown relief. He became the greatest and richest king on Earth, who eventually acquired all the treasures of the world. Uruk became unprecedentedly prosperous, and Gilgamesh was considered so powerful that even the gods could not ignore his existence. One goddess, Ishtar the goddess of fertility, even fell in love with Gilgamesh and proposed marriage to the perfect king. He rejected her immediately because he knew her to be a witch who was unfaithful, cruel, and the corruptor of all men. She became furious, feeling that he had insulted her, and went to her father, the god Anu, to get revenge. She begged him to unleash the Bull of Heaven. The unopposable beast of the gods caused seven years of starvation and destruction on the earth. Working together, Gilgamesh and Enkidu defeated it after binding it with the Chains of Heaven, causing the dark clouds covering the world to fade and saving the land from the flood. Ishtar's reputation was once again crushed, and her fury did not abate. She requested they be put to death for the sin of slaying a beast of the gods with the body of a human. Her request was granted, and Enkidu, created by the gods, was unable to defy the decree. He slowly weakened and was returned to clay, as Gilgamesh desperately held onto the crumbling clod in his arms. He was angered by this, believing that he was the one who deserved retribution should it be required. Enkidu attempted to assuage him by telling Gilgamesh that he was only one of the many treasures in Gilgamesh's collection, that he would find countless more greater than him in time. Gilgamesh instead declared, \"You do have worth. You alone have this worth. I hereby declare: In all this world, only one shall be my friend. Thus---not for all eternity shall his worth ever change.\" Enkidu returned to his original state afterward, leaving nothing behind but Gilgamesh's thunderous cry.Immortality  Up until that point, Gilgamesh had lived by his own standards, collecting riches, bedding women, fighting with his friend, and purging the earth of banes. Enkidu returning to dust, meeting death, greatly changed his views. Death had never inspired grief or fear in him until that moment, and it had never once even been in his mind though he knew that it awaited all. Seeing the one who held equal power to him perish before his eyes let him register the true reality of death for the first time. The despair that Gilgamesh felt was because he saw death as an escape from his duty as the observer of humanity; in order to fulfill his mission completely, he was to observe humanity's path until its eventual end. Falling into depression and with his vigor gone, he sought out the Herb of Immortality, a spirit herb of perpetual youth and eternal life. He had known of it even before Enkidu's passing, and had planned to obtain it eventually in order to complete his collection. With a reason to search for it, he left for the underworld, Ereshkigal. He sought out the sage, Ziusudra, who had lived since placing a large amount of animals upon an ark before the coming of a deluge that assailed the Earth. He was said to have been the only one of the Earth to escape from death and live until the present. Gilgamesh loathed and feared the death that took away his friend, making him frightened for his own life for the first time since birth. He went on his journey, that he later called a farce, that lasted the same amount of time as he had lived up until that point. He wandered the wilderness for decades as described in the epic, \"grovelling along pathetically\" while thinking nothing other than not wanting to die. He had the same motive as all humans, as not even a child of the gods was any different when faced with death. With \"idiocy exceeding that of humans\", he continued to attempt to overcome death, flinging aside the pride, authority, and power of the king, without knowing a purpose to do so or someone for whom to do it. His fear of death was one of the reasons for his actions, but he also loathed death because he could not forgive himself for abandoning his role of observing the future. He eventually reached the realm of the dead, and found upon meeting with Utnapishtim that his form of immortality was not special at all. Utnapishtim had gained longevity by joining the ranks of the gods, half-becoming a plant in the process. Gilgamesh rejected such an immortality because he had to be immortal with the desires of a human still intact, rather than simply living eternally in a body with no appetition. He had simply planned to leave the underworld and return to Uruk to bring his vault to completion, but Utnapishtim, having grown doubtful of having his way of existence rejected or possibly wanting to condemn one who had denied immortality from the gods to the same existence, told Gilgamesh a secret. He told Gilgamesh a method of becoming immortal without seeking the mercy of the gods, the root of a herb that grew in the deep. Though he would not consume it himself, as he would only become a plant, he collected it as a rare treasure to decorate his vault. Stopping within the deep, he jarred the herb and returned above ground. Unable to put words to his state of mind at the time, there was some part of him that was hopeful even though he declared that there was no need of immortality modeled on the gods. He smiled at his accomplishment upon returning above ground, believing that he could overthrow death and avenge his friend. With the ability to rise above the \"death\" that had taken even Enkidu, the voices and acclaim of the people of Uruk would have reached unprecedented level upon returning with immortality. Describing himself as being in the \"rashness of youth\", vanity soon followed and he became bothered by his ragged state to which he had not spared a single thought until that moment. He wished to cleanse himself before returning to Uruk to test the fruits of his labor in perfect condition, so he rested at a spring close by to recover from the fatigue accumulated over decades of searching. He experienced a certain feeling at that point that he believed to be his first true feeling of joy. As the water healed him, he felt a peacefulness like being released from a prolonged malaise in both body and mind. It was the first time he had been so ecstatic about any of his accomplishments because the act of amassing treasures is like an instinct similar to breathing that does not bring joy to him. The action of obtaining immortality was the first time he was thankful for being born into the world because, despite claiming to have the perspective of humans, he believed he was not human until that moment. He felt free from everything, no doubts, fears, fixations, or duties. Overwhelmed by the sensation of omnipotence, he describes the feeling as \u00e9lan vital, the reward of his self desire and the belief that he could do as he pleased with that joy for all eternity. It was then that his carelessness caused it to be snatched away from him, brought down by the desires, simple appetition of \"hunger\", of a serpent that crawled the wilds. The snake with an empty stomach was drawn by the herb's smell, and although a panicked Gilgamesh emerged from the spring, it was too late. The snake gained the property of shedding, having been the restoration of youth instead of immortality, and all that was left was its shed skin. He then was struck with laughter at the event, the absurdity of the conclusion in all he stood to gain and all he took pride in being \"naught.\" He laughed at his own foolishness until his sides ached. Though it was not that he was unable to obtain anything, he understood that his sole reward was that not one thing would remain for him. The fulfillment in life and joy that he obtained for the first time vanished instantly, causing him to realize that was the nature of the human world. Realizing that immortality was unnecessary to his duty, he had been born as a human at that moment and died as a human after learning of joy. Though he had been \"complete since birth\", he also had his times of inexperience. Taking nearly the entirety of his life to complete his development, he reached physical maturity in the time with Enkidu and mental maturity at that moment, marking the end of his youth. Having laughed away the theft, the sun had risen, and smiling at the fleeting moment of human joy, he returned to Uruk. Marking the end of his adventures, he governed Uruk as the ruler of heroes and brought it to completion. He later also returned to the deep to retrieve the herb once more simply to complete his collection and for the off-chance he would ever be in a situation he could only tolerate as a child. Though he was still severe, he ruled Uruk quietly, entrusting it to the next king before going to his eternal rest without telling the whereabouts of the herb. He became humanity's most ancient hero and the illustrious king who was the first in this world to have \"become a story.\" It is said that the snake begins its life again in a new body after shedding its skin because it stole Gilgamesh's medicine and drank it. The way snakes went about their life appeared to the ancient people as a kind of perpetual youth and eternal life that was not available to humans. The skin shed by the first snake in the world in ancient times was later fossilized and remained in existence for countless eons before being used as a catalyst by Tohsaka Tokiomi to summon Gilgamesh as Archer in the Fourth Holy Grail War.Appearance  Gilgamesh is a tall and dignified young man with golden hair standing up like a blazing flame. He is described as handsome with a\u00a0handsome face, and his eyes, crimson like blood, are visibly not those of a human and give off a mysterious radiance that makes people wither. He has a \"perfect, Golden-proportioned body\" described as emanating majesty that makes flames surrounding him afraid to come close, and his very soul glows golden. He normally wears golden armor that makes a heavy first impression on those he encounters. While fighting at full power in Fate/hollow ataraxia, he gains a number of red tattoos on his body that are not normally present. He is often referred to as the \"golden Archer\" and the \"golden-sparkling Servant,\" and Rider generally calls him \"Goldie.\" He is similarly called Gold-glitter\u00a0(\u91d1\u30d4\u30ab, Kin-Pika) due to his hair, armor, and golden soul, but Rin's reasoning behind the name has less to do with the color of his hair and more simply due to the fact that she thinks he looks like he is living a rich and luxurious life. He looks like a regular foreigner to both Rin and Archer, and he does not openly give off the impression of a Servant or Master due to his body being made of flesh after the Fourth Holy Grail War. He likes to wear casual clothes, \"playing attire\" to ward off boredom from being in spirit form, when not in battle, later becoming knowledgeable on the latest fashion trends after living in modern society for ten years. He has collected a number of casual outfits.Personality  Gilgamesh greatly differs from most of the sovereigns and leaders in the history of humanity. He placed himself before his nation and the people, and he had neither the curiosity nor desire to conquer, possibly because he had too much in the beginning. He takes the time to enjoy himself, mastering every treasure and every pleasure. With conviction to treat good and evil equally, he has no need for other ideologies and ways of life when the absolute basis is \"himself.\" His actions and way of life left him alone, so Enkidu compared rectifying his attitude to rectifying his solitude. He follows a simple style of ruling, acquiring worthy treasures and guarding them. He exterminates those that stand in the way of his enjoyment without exception. All living beings are \"something that is about to die\" or \"something that will one day die.\" If he decides that there is a \"being that should die this moment\", he will simply execute the sentence no matter if they should be a sage or a god. If it is an astute judgment synonymous to universal truth, or even a misrule during a drunken stupor, anything carried out by him, the absolute king, becomes the indisputable sentence of the king. He is extremely arrogant and selfish, believing himself to be the sole potentate and only king of the world even many millennia after his death. He cannot acknowledge the authority of anyone, including that of other kings and especially that of the gods. He considers all those around him as inferior due to this fact, viewing all other kings and heroes as a collection of mongrels, and loathes any individual who would try to be on the same level as him. The only exception is Enkidu, who he considered to be his equal and only friend. He responds to Iskander's request to form an alliance with him by saying \"It is unfortunate, but I do not require a second friend. Past and future, my companion will only be one.\" He believes that all who look upon him, when he honors them with his presence, should be able to recognize him instantly, and feels that the ignorance of not knowing him is worthy of death. If anyone so much as looks upon him with a \"lowly and filthy\" gaze, it is an intolerable disgrace for a nobleman who claims the title of king more so than anyone else. This is enough to make that person a complete malefactor in his eyes, instantly marked for death. He doesn't view the modern world as worthy of having him rule over it because humanity has become too weak. After finding out the nature of the Holy Grail, he plans to use it to exterminate most of the world's population and rule over those who survive. Gilgamesh has a natural disposition to collect items for his treasury, which lead to collecting all the treasures of the world. The treasures he amassed went without use until his fight with Enkidu, causing him to develop the \"bad habit\" of utilizing them as projectiles. The act of collecting is something that has never brought him true joy due to essentially being on the same level as breathing to him, but he still persists at it nonetheless. He lives by the Golden Rule, only accepting the finest of luxuries, and those who fall to it are utterly blinded by money. Despite his treasury having been dispersed all over the world, he still holds that it all belongs to him. As its contents even exceeded his knowledge, if an item is labeled as a \"treasure\", it is obvious that it belongs to him. He has absolutely no interest in the Holy Grail before finding out its true nature because competing for his own treasure is a pointless action. He doesn't have a wish, but he cannot allow people to rob his treasury as a matter of principles. The only reason he needs is that it was the law he set down as king. Only if he agrees to give someone the Holy Grail would he allow them to obtain it, but the rats trying to steal his treasure are not worthy of reward. He doesn't mind rewarding his own subjects and people, and would even allow Rider a \"cup or two\" if he were to bow down to him. He takes a great interest in Saber and her ideals, and proposes that she becomes his wife. He becomes enthralled with her stubbornness, believing there has to be at least one person in the world to deny him. Should he actually \"obtain\" her, he comes to realize that the outcome is not very satisfying. Normally people consider flowers at their most beautiful as their petals fall, but he only feels disappointment if he ever manages to have her because she only shines brightly to him when she is opposing him. He decides to \"show her his love\" until he grows tired of her. He has no interest in Saber Alter because she has lost sight of her ideals. He is prone to underestimating his opponents and views combat as a game of amusement. His gigantic ego prevents him from acknowledging his opponent as a real threat and he does not battle them seriously. He will properly fight those he respects, or simply utilize more power than necessary on a whim depending on the situation. If his Master happens to grow on him, or he decides that their battle is worth fighting for, then he could become somewhat more willing to use his full power should they will it. He is influenced by the era in which he is summoned, and in the case where he achieves incarnation, his blood as a human will stir and gravitate towards that of the humans of the era. The consumption society of the early 2000s sullied his property, the world, so he is in a worse mood overall. Even with his personality, Gilgamesh was able to blend into the society without a problem. While he will always retain his core self-centered traits, he will be more stable and like he was in life when summoned in a place without any alteration like the Moon Cell. He is quite different between the Fourth and Fifth Holy Grail Wars due to his priorities. He simply enjoys the events of the Fourth, but the Fifth is utilized to fulfill his goals of making humankind worth governing and coercing Saber to become his bride. Kinoko Nasu describes the variation in his personality as the \"prideful Boss King of Heroes\" and the \"not very prideful Horny King of Heroes.\" Gilgamesh speaks with the notion that nothing is greater than himself, using a commanding pronoun\u00a0(\u6211, ore, written as \"ware\"). He is the type of person to become angry even if someone is to simply try to converse with him, thinking something like \"A plebeian dares to speak with the King? Such insolence!\" In Fate/Grand Order his profile states that his nature is cruel and heartless. Never hearing people's opinions, a tyrant who holds only his own standards as absolute. Pretentiously displaying an extremely gaudy golden armor, this exceptional Heroic Spirit releases his excessive treasures as if abundant water. Gilgamesh seems to have tolerance and in some rare cases soft spot towards children. In Fate/strange Fake, he shows some degree of leniency towards his master Tin\u00e9 Chelc and takes measures to protect her from harm. He even addresses her by her real name although he initially refers her as\u00a0\"mongrel girl.\" In Fate/hollow Ataraxia, he is seen fishing with his\u00a0children admirers at the Fuyuki Dock, although he\u00a0calls them mongrels, albeit good-naturedly. Gilgamesh is a collector of treasures. His favorite phrase is \"I've assembled all treasures in the land\", but that is not a metaphor. He has assembled, stored and sealed away every sample of technology that were developed in his age. His argument is \"humans are foolish, but there is value in the tools, civilization that humans create\".Humanity  Gilgamesh was born as a guardian of humanity, so it is his duty to lay the foundations for the future civilization of the planet. He does not view sheltering as his way of guardianship, but instead a harsh form resembling the north wind. He is the adjudicator of humanity who is an observer and sentencer at his core, punition personified and uncolored by human values. He lives by the ideal that later became Code of Ur-Nammu and Code of Hammurabi, that it is law for humans to prosecute humans. He had been brought forth by the gods to secure humanity for them, but he did not fulfill his role. He considered his own desires first, and he controlled the kingdom as a person. He rejected the gods as something from a past age, telling them that he will obey and respect them and at the same time telling them to be destroyed. He believed they lost their positions through their own actions the moment they brought him forth into the world. Although he was created for a specific purpose, he did not feel contempt for being artificially manufactured life for the sake of being used by the gods, and although his every cell was designed before birth, he was born from her mother's womb like a normal human; therefore, he was both \"born\" and \"created\" at the same time. It matters not if a being is an animal or a puppet, as all life is created through the intentions of the parents. He was brought forth by predecessors like all living things, the only difference being that his predecessor was the planet, the gods. The \"self\", the soul, is the only naturally occurring and unique part of life, awaking to individual originality that cannot be thought of as having been created. Whether the body was manufactured or the product of reproduction, the shape of life is always brought forth by predecessors, so only the naturally occurring soul matters to him. The gods' countermeasure was correct, but it was that, being born as a new life with a new will, that he did not behave in accordance with their wishes. While he was designed as the keystone for the gods, he became the tip of the spear that put an end to the old age. He decided upon reaching adulthood that he would not live as a king governing his people, but would instead act as a storm that reprimanded them. Ignoring the will of the gods, he ruled Uruk because it was something worthwhile. Collecting and seizing as he willed it, the nation and the people were his all for the reason of judging them. He considers humanity to be the epitome of ingenuity, but says it lacks a shared standard. It is for this reason that humanity continues to bring forth new advancements, and the reason that an absolute standard is indispensable. It required someone human while more than human and belonged to the gods without being a god. It would have simply taken a human to govern and a god to menace, but the gods never understood that even in the very end. To better become this absolute standard, he collected all the treasures of the world and judged the worth of humanity. Enkidu believed that his actions, his tyranny over his people, extended from his ability to see even what the gods were unable to comprehend. His overwhelming power bred overwhelming isolation for him, but his strength of self did not allow him to abandon his kingship or flee from this mission imposed upon him. The reason that he favored isolation is that he chose that path and needed to advance down it alone. He needed to hate the gods and dislike the people while keeping the future in mind, so he needed to be isolated. The more favorably he regarded the future of humanity, the farther he had to remove himself. The only thing he stood to gain was the result of it because, being more than human, he could not interfere with the brilliant course it would bring about. He personally felt the resulting future would be quite dull, but decided to abide his decision to the end. Even Enkidu, sharing the same origins, was unable to see the sights on which his distant gaze was set. Enkidu regarded this isolation, his ability to remain aloof, as his greatest sincerity. Though he knew the weak, he never glanced back at them, and though he knew the strong, he never acknowledged them. Though he should have had none by his side, Enkidu believed that he had sinned in leaving a lasting mar upon that integrity. Though he is similar to Alexander the Great in the manner of pride, their greatest difference is \"not needing retainers.\" He is only dedicated to himself, so his loves are only treasures and tools. People are only things that will disappear. During his search for immortality, he was also obsessed with seeing the end of humanity. Dying would mean abandoning his role, his kingship, because he had determined to be the observer and adjudicator of the people. It was necessary to obtain an enduring body that would last until the end of the world not to see everyday contentment, but the deeds, the future of the people, and witness their end. He felt true joy for the first time upon obtaining it, but it was snatched away in an instant by the snake. This caused him to realize that was the nature of the world of humanity, that which he must observe. He realized he could not understand that unique appeal with an undying body, realizing immortality to be nothing by the incompleteness of the common people and the dream of those who cannot face the end. He decided he had no need for it because his eyes that could foresee the future had no reason to fear death. He was able to exist in that era, unfading at that moment, and still gaze at the distant future even without experiencing the passage of time. His duty would be fullfilled as long as a hero, humanity's most ancient tale, was passed down through the ages. The future he is able to see for humanity is that of human knowledge continuing to expand until they will be able to see even light from millions of years away. Though it would take such a long time that his body will have long rotted, it was an exhilarating sight for him, but he feels that he must have lost his drive. Having collected all that needed to be collected, he found no further joy in that era. He needed to simply depart with integrity, experiencing death as many times as necessary, time and again reviving and observing until the end of the world and the day when humanity reaches beyond his garden, the planet, to reach the end of the sky and strike its final note.Childhood  Gilgamesh has nothing in common with his childhood-self, and their natures are so different that he cannot even perceive his younger self's past. He can only speak as if having heard from secondhand accounts, and he, who had never forgotten anything from birth, cannot remember his childhood well. He believes his younger self would be the same, and that it is likely he would have stopped his own growth had he known what his adult-self would be like at the time. He was benevolent, cherished by the people who praised him as having \"gained the best king there was.\" He was known as tolerant, sage, fair, and moral, and he had a kingly aptitude superior to all. He changed greatly as he grew, becoming the King that the gods created Enkidu to punish. After Gilgamesh consumes the Herb of Immortality, he becomes his well-mannered, polite and amiable younger self. He not only retains his memory, but his royal and divine charisma as well. He is amiable with Shirou and expresses his uneasiness of how he grows up to become someone so unpleasant. He becomes a popular idol among children in Fuyuki, as he is seen leading a football team with amazing leadership. Though he later reverts to his adult self, he is able to socialize with others without issue, as he is seen fishing at the Fuyuki dock with several children and they are having a good time making fun of Lancer that doesn't manage to catch even a single fish, though he displays his usual arrogance, and becomes portrayed comically in a number of scenes.Relationships  Artoria PendragonRole Fate/Zero  Gilgamesh is summoned by Tokiomi Tohsaka in the Fourth Holy Grail War. While the relic used as the catalyst looked like the broken fragment of a mummy, it was actually claimed to be the fossil of the first skin ever shed by a snake. He immediately takes notice of both Saber and Rider due to their status as kings. As they exchange their philosophies on ruling as monarchs, he develops a fascination for Saber due to her flawed ideals and the chance to see them crush her in despair. He feels Rider is a suitable opponent after witnessing Ionioi Hetairoi, and exclaims that he will be the one to kill him. He eventually begins to take an interest in the actions taken by Kirei Kotomine, Tokiomi's disciple, because of the conflicts in his heart. He has begun to find Tokiomi boring and uninteresting to view, so he attempts to guide Kirei into finding true pleasure in his otherwise empty life. He suggests that Kirei should determine the backgrounds and the motivations of the other Masters and Servants as to why they wish to obtain the Holy Grail. As Kirei takes an interest in Kariya Matou, he convinces him to learn about him specifically. After witnessing Excalibur, he remembers the death of Enkidu, unable to forget the way he passed away with tears streaming down his face. Their final conversation differs from Fate/Extra CCC. He asked Enkidu \"Why are you crying? Could it be that, only now, you are regretting having taken my side?\", to which Enkidu responded \"Who would understand you after I die? Who else would march forward by your side? My friend... when I think that you will live on all alone henceforth, I can't help but shed tears...\" As he saw Enkidu taking his last breaths, he realized that the way the man who was human but wanted to surpass humanity had lived was even more precious and more brilliant than all the treasures he had collected. His final words to Enkidu were \"You fool who stretches your hand towards realms not of men... There is only one person in heaven or earth who's worthy of appreciating your destruction, and that is none other than I, Gilgamesh. Sink into my embrace, oh you glorious and illusionary man. That is my decision.\" As Enkidu's golden majestic brilliance disappeared in the night mist, there was only an evil laughter left echoing long after. In the culmination of the events with Kirei, it is revealed that Tokiomi will use a Command Spell to force Gilgamesh to commit suicide to gain the Holy Grail and proposes that he should form a new contract. Gilgamesh allows him to murder his former mentor and forms a contract with Kirei afterward. He continues to observe Kirei's movements with interest, and finally has his duel with Rider that ends in Rider's defeat. In a moment of respect, he spares Waver Velvet after the fight because he no longer has any claims as a Master, only proclaims that he is Rider's follower, and says that as his king told him to live, he cannot seek revenge only to die. During the final confrontation with Saber, he proposes that she becomes his wife while she lays defeated in front of him. Their battle is interrupted by Kiritsugu Emiya ordering Saber to destroy the Holy Grail. Due to his proximity, Gilgamesh is caught off guard and becomes drenched by the pollution that spills from the Holy Grail. He obtains a physical body, and because he has been incarnated into the world, he decides that it is time to once again unite the world under his rule. He continues to follow Kotomine after the war is over, and Kotomine provides him with energy drained from children orphaned by the fire to sustain himself. He decides to wait for the next Holy Grail War to cleanse humanity, so he retrieves a potion of temporary youth from his vault that reduces his physical age and allows him to smoothly blend in with society for ten years.Fate/stay night  Gilgamesh is one of the antagonists in each scenario of Fate/stay night. He first appears before the start of the Fifth Holy Grail War around Sakura's house. He identifies her as \"the other Grail\" and comes to tell her \"Go die right now.\" It is just a suggestion rather than a command, as he believes that the matter will develop into some sort of entertainment regardless of the situation. When questioned about the encounter, Sakura just claims that he was asking for directions and that \"It was English\" in order to hide the truth.Fate  In Fate, Gilgamesh suddenly appears and destroys Caster's Dragon Tooth Warriors when she is assaulting the Emiya residence. Shocked by this, Shirou, Saber, and Caster all stare toward Gilgamesh standing atop the residence's wall. Staring only at Saber, he ignores Caster until she asks him who he is. With that Gilgamesh coldly proclaims he has no reason to name himself to a lowlife. Then, with a snap of his fingers, he launches various weapons at Caster, who is seemingly killed after her shield is shattered by them. However, Gilgamesh sees through her deception when she tries to escape as a floating shred of her robe, and proceeds to finally kill Caster. Gilgamesh remarks that he only has the right to capture Saber, who he reminds of his marriage proposal from ten years ago. He then takes notice of Rin and Illya, who is confused by Gilgamesh's mere existence and attacks him. With a mirror-like shield, he easily deflects the blast of magical energy that Illya launched at him back toward her, but Rin manages to block it. Recognizing Illya as the vessel of the Holy Grail as well her hybrid parentage, Gilgamesh tells her to hurry and become the fifth. Afterwards, Saber asks him why he is still in the world to which he answers that the Grail is his treasure, and then states that he came to fight Saber but decided that the Emiya residence was too shabby to celebrate his reunion with her. Stating to Saber that they'll meet again, he tells her to prepared for that meeting before leaving. Later, Gilgamesh ambushes Shirou and Saber when they're walking home together. Reminding Saber that they would meet again, he states that he has come for her. Saber then prepares to fight him to let Shirou escape, but Shirou, sensing that she would be unable to defeat Gilgamesh, decides to protects her instead. Gilgamesh then takes notice of Shirou, proclaiming him to be so shabby of a Master that he thought him to be a dog or something. Telling Saber to run to the Church for shelter, Shirou runs toward Gilgamesh, but he is struck down by a hammer. As Shirou lies on the ground, Gilgamesh tells him that he won't kill him since Saber would disappear, but states that although keeping Shirou alive is the easiest way to keep Saber, he will kill Shirou if he irritates him. Saber tries to run to Shirou, but Gilgamesh blocks her and questions why she doesn't submit to him already. Revealing his knowledge of Saber's contract with the World, he offers to give Saber a second life with him, but she outright refuses his offer. Laughing at her defiance, Gilgamesh decides that he'll force Saber to be his, and that he'll pour the contents of the Grail on her so that she may be incarnated like him. Saber then asks for his intentions, to which Gilgamesh answers that he has no interest in the Grail but proclaims he'll use it if it will let him rule the world once again. After hearing his answer, Saber attacks Gilgamesh, but her strike is deflected by his golden armor that he just equipped at that moment. After blocking numerous blows by Saber with his armor, Gilgamesh opens the Gate of Babylon, which catches Saber off-guard as she is attacked by numerous Noble Phantasms. Saber then asks him who he is due to the vast quantities of Noble Phantasms he possesses, but Gilgamesh answers that he collected them during his lifetime, which Saber states to be impossible. However, after being impressed by Shirou for discerning his identity, Gilgamesh reveals that he is the most ancient king that ruled the world when it was one, and spent his time collecting weapons that were never used into his treasury. After his death, the weapons within the treasury were scattered across the world, eventually becoming Noble Phantasms. With that, Shirou and Saber realize that he is Gilgamesh, the King of Heroes, the strongest Heroic Spirit. Yet despite knowing his identity, Saber continues to fight him and unveils Excalibur, which prompts Gilgamesh to unveil Ea. Their Noble Phantasms then clash with one another, but Ea overwhelms Excalibur, leaving Saber critically wounded. Amused that the strongest holy sword couldn't overcome his own sword, Gilgamesh laughs that he is disappointed that Saber couldn't even offset his attack. Gilgamesh then moves to capture Saber, but Shirou manages to get up and attack him with a projected Caliburn. Irritated by Shirou's resistance, Gilgamesh decides to use Merodach, Caliburn's original model, which easily shatters Caliburn and leaves Shirou nearly bisected. Impressed that Shirou wasn't completely blown apart by his sword, Gilgamesh once again moves to capture Saber. However, Shirou manages to regenerate and get up to block Gilgamesh, which prompts him to launch Merodach again to kill Shirou. However, Shirou projects Avalon, and with Saber's help, deflects Gilgamesh's attack back at him. Infuriated by his defeat, Gilgamesh silently departs the scene. After Shirou and Saber reject Kirei's offer, Gilgamesh comes down to the Church's basement when Kirei snaps his fingers to call him, which shocks Saber and Lancer. After Kirei introduces him as his Servant from the previous war, Gilgamesh asks Kirei if he is going to get rid of Shirou and Saber here and now despite it not being good direction on Kirei's part. After accepting Kirei's apology for not expecting the current situation, Gilgamesh states he'll kill Lancer if he continues to glare at him. Then, after Kirei reveals the corrupted nature of the Grail, Gilgamesh is ordered by him to kill Saber while Lancer kills Shirou before he leaves. After Kirei leaves, Shirou and Saber decide to charge through Gilgamesh and Lancer in order to escape. However, to Shirou and Saber's surprise, Lancer attacks Gilgamesh, but his spear is repelled a long sword. Gilgamesh reminds Lancer that he is to kill Shirou while he is to kill Saber, but Lancer decides to betray Kirei on his own principles. Gilgamesh then prepares to kill Lancer, purposefully letting Shirou and Saber, which confuses Lancer since Saber was Gilgamesh's target. He answers that he had no intention to kill Saber since she belongs to him, and states he needs one more Servant to die so that he claim the Grail. The two Servants then begin their battle, which ends in Gilgamesh's victory after half a day. Afterwards he goes to Ryuudou Temple, where he waits for Saber's arrival. As Shirou and Saber arrive at the temple, Gilgamesh welcomes Saber, and states that the Grail has summoned. He is reveals that contents of the Grail are a curse that spilled onto him when Saber destroyed the Grail ten years ago. Saber then asks him for his intentions regarding the curse, to which Gilgamesh answers that he unconcerned how Kirei uses the Grail and that Saber is his only concern. Summoning several weapons, Gilgamesh prepares to fight, saying how will force Saber to swallow the Grail's contents. He continues to say that Saber will be unable to stop from going insane after that, and that she'll disgrace yourself and beg at his feet. Saber answers that Gilgamesh will meet the same fate and readies herself for battle, which causes Gilgamesh to be delighted by her strong spirit despite knowing she cannot defeat him. Not wanting any intrusions in his battle, Gilgamesh tells Shirou that Kirei is waiting for him at the back of the temple. As Shirou leaves to confront Kirei, Gilgamesh and Saber begin their battle. Using the weapons summoned from his treasury, Gilgamesh fight Saber, but her unhesitating attacks cause him to retreat a couple times despite blocking her with weapons summoned from behind him. However, Gilgamesh still has the advantage due to his weapons having unknown abilities that Saber can only repel, and that he is left unfatigued by their battle unlike her. Gilgamesh asks Saber if she going to continue fighting since it is futile, and that Kirei should've killed Shirou by now. Saber counters that Shirou is still alive and will not lose to Kirei. Gilgamesh then claims that Shirou will soon die by the Grail's curse, which he admits even he has trouble against. Stating that Saber cannot beat him and that Shirou cannot beat Kirei, Gilgamesh says that if Saber gone after the Grail, she would've already won the battle. But, Saber states that her decision was correct, she will not lose to Gilgamesh, and Shirou will not lose to Kirei, whom she calls a corpse. Summoning even more Noble Phantasm from his treasury, Gilgamesh launches them all at Saber from all directions. Saber manages to elude all of them, but Gilgamesh summons even more weapons and launches them at her, which manage hit this time. As his weapons continue to fire, Gilgamesh pulls out Ea and releases it as Saber releases Excalibur while Kirei summons the curse of the Grail against Shirou that covered the earth for an instant. After waking from the unpleasant sensation from the Grail's curse, Saber is left unable to move despite managing offset Ea a bit with Excalibur while Gilgamesh approaches her. Saber asks him what that darkness from the back of the temple was, to which Gilgamesh answers that was the curse of the grail that curses everything in the world summoned by Kirei. He continues to say that pollution that Saber saw up to now was just the remaining contents of the Grail from ten years, and that now the primary curse has been summoned, Shirou should be dead. As Saber, sensing that Shirou is still barely alive, fails to get up, Gilgamesh tells her that the Grail will overflow, and that events of ten years ago shall reoccur. Telling Saber to rejoice, he tells that if she is showered by the Grail's contents, then she too will become incarnated like he was, though he doubts she can keep his sanity like he did. Seeing that Saber believes him to be insane already, Gilgamesh claims that only three times of All the World's Evils summoned from the Grail can affect him. Gilgamesh then grabs Saber by the foot, and asks once again to marry him with the intention of killing her should she refuse. Saber refuses since she already belongs to her country, which Gilgamesh sneers as a country is just a possession of the king. If a king cannot rule everything then there is no point in having one, which Gilgamesh states as the reason why Saber's country had destroyed her. Saber accepts his words but states that the very same reason is why Gilgamesh destroyed his own country, and promptly kicks him in the face with her free leg causing him to release her. Infuriated, Gilgamesh releases Ea once again to kill Saber, which she tries to counter with Excalibur but fails to release it. However to his confusion, Gilgamesh watches as Saber steps into the swirling energy of Enuma Elish, in which she releases Excalibur to create boundary in space. Gilgamesh then releases Ea at maximum power, but Saber completely blocks it using Avalon to his utter disbelief. Unable to take action, Gilgamesh can only scream Saber's name as she charges toward him armor-less to finally strike him down with Excalibur. As he stands there dying before an exhausted Saber, Gilgamesh touches her face and expresses how hateful she is for defying him to very end. However, he decides to forgive her as he realizes that some things are beautiful because they cannot be obtained. He continues sullenly that his loss against her was inevitable if that is the case as his hand falls from her cheek. Gilgamesh then tells Saber goodbye, stating that it was fun, before finally disappearing with an ironic smile.Unlimited Blade Works  Gilgamesh is more active in Unlimited Blade Works, and becomes the main antagonist midway through the story. He is \"lent\" to Shinji Matou after Shinji's Servant, Rider, is killed by Souichirou Kuzuki and later kills Ilya and Berserker. When next he appeared, it was following Archer's kidnap of Rin, due to Kirei leading Shinji there, in attempts to procure Rin to turn her into the Holy Grail's core. In response to Archer's comment of how, if Shinji did not agree to not do anything to Rin until his deal with Shirou was finished, he would die there, he became offended, and filled with enmity. Shinji accepted the condition, so he did not take much action, awaiting Archer to pass him by, to say, \"Faker,\" as a way to suggest he knew his true identity all along, in a voice filled with loathing. Instead of staying with Shinji, Gilgamesh went to observe Shirou and Archer's fight. Once it was over, he assaulted Archer in a surprise attack to kill him, and explained the true nature of the Holy Grail to Shirou, Rin, and Saber. He had planned to resume his fight with Saber from the end of the last war, but because Lancer had set the building on fire, Gilgamesh was forced to change his plans, as avoiding getting soot on his favorite clothes was more important than killing them all right there. Shinji had lost Rin to use as the Holy Grail vessel, so when next they meet up, Gilgamesh decided to turn Shinji into the core of the Holy Grail using Illya's heart. As the Holy Grail began to enact his wish and eradicate humanity, Rin, Saber and Shirou show up to interfere with his plans. Gilgamesh and Shirou begin a climatic battle, where he explained the hypocrisy in his ideals, explaining how flawed they were, similar to how Archer did, and then, he is humiliated and overwhelmed by Shirou within his Unlimited Blade Works. In defiance to how his attempt to kill Shirou after he had run out of mana would have succeeded, having lost Shinji, because of Rin, it attempted to use him as the core, next, and he desperately tried to escape its clutches, going so far as to using the Chains of Heaven on Shirou, but using this situation to his advantage, Archer appeared, and he finally got killed by him.Heaven's Feel  Gilgamesh has a small role in Heaven's Feel scenario, where, first, he appears when Shirou went to see Kirei about the Fourth Holy Grail War, sitting in a chair, to get up when he entered, and exchange a few words with Shirou, his presence being enough to intimidate him greatly through the enmity of his presence, prior to going up to the next floor to watch the conversation between Shirou and Kirei that was about to commence. A while afterwards, he's seen speaking with Kirei in his room, commenting on how he disliked the being causing murders throughout Fuyuki, a comment of which, even surprised Kirei, to such, he explained he disliked it, because humans should only be killed by the king\u2014 himself, following up by once again asking him if he had any wish for the Holy Grail. Hearing Kirei's usual answer that he has none, he became amused, and laughed, noting how well suited they were for each other, because he killed, because humans were disgusting to him, and Kirei did, simply because it was enjoyable, and ended the conversation by leaving the room, shortly after. In his final appearance, he lacerates Dark Sakura with swords from the Gate of Babylon. However, he underestimates her regenerative abilities and is devoured by her shadows. Dark Sakura is forced to quickly convert him to mana in haste because Gilgamesh's ego allows him to be immune to the mental pollution and she was afraid he might tear her up from the inside if she did not digest him.Fate/hollow ataraxia  Gilgamesh utilizes his child form for much of Fate/hollow ataraxia to act low-profile in Fuyuki City and avoid interacting with previous Servants or Masters. During the Fuyuki eclipse, he reverts to his adult form and assists the other Servants in slaying the endless horde of Shadow Wolf Beasts, providing the opportunity for Avenger to make his way to Heaven's Feel.Fate/unlimited codes  He is given the title The Oldest King of Heroes\u00a0(\u6700\u53e4\u306e\u82f1\u96c4\u738b, Saiko no Eiy\u016b-\u014c) in Fate/unlimited codes. In his story, Kirei meets Gilgamesh and discussed about the assembled Master and Servant in the Fifth Grail War. Kirei confirmed the summoning of Saber to Gilgamesh, Gilgamesh becomes pleased after hearing this and calls her foolish for not knowing the real contents of the Grail. He proudly boast about his survival in the Fourth Holy Grail War when he was bathed in the black mud and how it is proof of his greatness, he believed others would have gone insane from its power. He calls those who believed the Holy Grail to be a wishing device to be foolish. Kirei questions about his intention because Kirei believes he doesn't need to part as a Servant. However Gilgamesh proclaims that the Holy Grail is his property and Kirei suggest him to use the Grail. Gilgamesh takes on the offer and looks forward to meeting Saber. He meets Dark Sakura, Sakura remembers her encounter with Gilgamesh when he ordered her to die. Sakura refused to die while Gilgamesh was hoping the Holy Grail wouldn't form properly but is disappointed to see how it progressed. He decided for her to die and claims that Sakura hates herself for being so compatible. He says he does not allow murder by anyone other than himself because when a human kills another human, they become lost in guilt and suffering, which he does not find enjoyment in. He meets Saber in the Emiya residence, Gilgamesh reminds Saber about his decision on making her his wife. Saber questions about how Gilgamesh was able to return in the Fifth Holy Grail War and Gilgamesh told her the truth. Gilgamesh offers Saber to be his wife, Saber refused and they both fight until Gilgamesh wins. Gilgamesh forces Saber to bathe in the black mud from the Grail, it is slowly corrupting her to be Saber Alter. Gilgamesh decides to show his love to Saber until he grows tired of her. \"Until then, let us enjoy the pains and joys of life as we please.\"Fate/Grand Order GUDAGUDA Honnouji  Gilgamesh appears in the singularity under the name Toyotomi Gilyoshi. After Ritsuka, Mash, Okita, and Nobunaga enter \"Osaka\", Toyotomi welcomes them as proclaims himself to be the King of Heroes and the ruler of Zipangu, the Land of Gold, and that all treasures belong to him whether they be gold or exquisite tea sets. He then continues to claim that he cannot be affected so easily by the singularity, telling the group that he is here on a different matter. However, when Mash wonders about the matter he speaks of, Toyotomi claims that he bestowed the group his finest treasures yet they said Rome's treasures were better. He continues that he wanted Rome's treasures too, and wonders why no one came to his summons. Toyotomi then says he won't give up, stating that some things are beautiful because you don't own them. He then proclaims that he will build up his power in preparation for the next event by gathering all gathering all gold and tea sets in the country. Toyotomi then becomes angered when Ritsuka and Mash are ready to fight him, to which he orders Takenaka Andersen and Kuroda Mephisto to give him a plan. Then, after Toyotomi and his subordinates are defeated by the group in battle, he is in disbelief at his lord, and then dies after saying to act now to become an Uruk citizen.Miss Almost Weekly Santa Alter  Sending a letter to Santa Alter, Gilgamesh waits for her arrival. He calls praiseworthy for a king to try and meet his subject's expectations, and he could learn her example though he won't. Gilgamesh then expresses his interest in Christmas, stating that even during Christmas even a modest woman cannot help but speak her heart out. He continues that he can't imagine a future but one where Santa Alter will confess her feeling to him, though he shall allow it. Gilgamesh demands for Santa Alter to come quickly, and says he'll make her understand their differences through his treasury. He then laughs that she is Christmas present.Interlude  The Worthy\u00a0(\u5024\u3059\u308b\u3082\u306e) is his interlude. Axiom of Creation\u00a0(\u958b\u95e2\u306e\u7406) is his interlude.Capsule Servant Carnival Phantasm  Gilgamesh appears in Carnival Phantasm, serving the role of a \"friend nobody likes\" based on the general reaction of the other Fate characters to his presence. He appears in the first episode outright breaking the rules and using his Noble Phantasm to attack Lancer. In episode 5, he is referred to as \"Gil the Prankster.\" He attempts to get rid of Berserker but fails and becomes the first Servant Berserker defeats. Berserker also trips on him later on in the episode. In episode 8, Gilgamesh teases Saber over her employment at Ahnenerbe, but receives a verbal backlash from Saber Alter, whom he immediately develops a crush on. In episode 9, Gilgamesh participates in the race even though Kirei Kotomine did not invite him due to his rule-breaking tendencies. The episode reveals Gilgamesh spent the ten years between the 4th and 5th Grail Wars developing a passion for race cars. Gilgamesh's child self appears in episode EX as Caren Hortensia's Servant alongside Lancer.Today's Menu for Emiya Family  N/AAll Around Type-Moon  Gilgamesh, in his child form, appears once in All Around Type-Moon.Other appearances  Fate/strange fake and Fate/Extra CCC feature other incarnations of Gilgamesh separate from the version summoned during the Fuyuki Holy Grail Wars. Archer of strange fake is the Servant of Tine Chelc, and Gilgamesh in Fate/Extra CCC is one of the four selectable Servants summoned by Hakuno Kishinami along with Saber, Caster, and Archer. Fate/Prototype features Archer, an alternate version of Gilgamesh that lacks his kingly disposition. Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA\u2606ILLYA features an incarnation of Gilgamesh that takes form as his child self. Gilgamesh also appears in Fate/Extella as a member of Altera's team, as well as Altera's second-in-command. Like all Servants, he has his own side story.Abilities  Gilgamesh is the most powerful existence among the Servants in both the Fourth and Fifth Holy Grail War and the strongest Heroic Spirit. He is placed into the Archer class because of his main Noble Phantasm, Gate of Babylon. It grants him access to all of the world's treasures that he collected during his life, which include prototypes of other heroes' Noble Phantasms, and he can launch them as the strongest arrows towards his opponents. While he may sometimes choose to wield them as regular weapons, he mainly fights by raining down an infinite amount of weapons on his opponents. The most trusted Noble Phantasms contained within include Enkidu and Ea. While he has numerous Noble Phantasms, none are indicative of his true identity, and the only person through both Holy Grail Wars to figure out his identity without being told is Rider, though Shirou is able to guess after he gives a number of details about himself. The energy of his soul is worth that of hundreds of thousands of souls, and taking him in is enough to fill a partially-full Lesser Grail even while it lacks several other Servants. He has the skill Golden Rule, being fated to a life that is filled with riches. It does not measure the percentage of gold in one's body, but the chance of attracting gold in one's life. The level of gold provided by rank A will make the user incredibly wealthy to the point where money trouble will be unknown, allowing him to live the life of a nabob. While it seems unrelated to battle, it plays a great role in arming him. Claiming all the world's treasures as his own, he obtained the originals of Noble Phantasms preserved in his treasury during that period. He has a very high rank of Charisma with the influence to build a grand empire on a global scale. He is often praised as the greatest king, so his ability to command and lead great armies is excellent. It is a rare talent, and even a B rank is sufficient enough to lead a nation. Gilgamesh has a rank of A+, making it no longer a matter of popularity or skill, but closer to something like sorcery or curse. Any army led by him will have a tremendous increase in abilities because an egotistical Gilgamesh radiating with self-confidence is sure to boost the morale of his army to an extremely high level. He would normally possess the highest rank of Divinity among all Heroic Spirits due to being 2/3 God. He is at a level even exceeding Heracles, the son of Zeus who ascended to the Pantheon after death. The rank is instead decreased from A+ to B because of his hatred of the gods, who killed his only companion, Enkidu, unleashed the Bull of Heaven onto the earth, and caused him much trouble in his life.Combat  Gilgamesh's compatibility against Heroic Spirits is great due to the versatility of his weapons, allowing him to assault the weakness of any Servant. He is about as physically strong as Saber or Berserker, if not weaker, and he would not receive a boost in power from fame due to not being well known in Japan. The main reason for his overwhelming power comes from the sheer number of Noble Phantasms in his possession. All Heroic Spirits have things they were weak against in life, their greatest weak points, and he possess all of the Noble Phantasms, including those that killed each hero. He can be called the \"Servant Killer\" because he has an advantage over most of them in combat and because they are no match for him. While there would be no competition between him and Saber in terms of direct swordsmanship with the same Noble Phantasm, he does not display power as an \"individual\" soldier, but rather as a \"war\" that even the strongest soldier could not overcome by himself. Only those who are a \"war\" themselves will be able to compete against him. In terms of the \"firepower\" available to him due to the versatility of his weaponry, he can be said to have the strength of \"5 Servants + a\", a force able to match all the Servants and Masters defending the town in Fate/hollow ataraxia, putting him at an advantage against those like Arcueid Brunestud whose strength is based on the \"single entity ability\" of the opponent rather than their weaponry. Gilgamesh's pride and carelessness often keep him from fighting seriously, considering it to be unbecoming to be serious for the Holy Grail. As his dignity cannot be yielded, such weaknesses \"kind of balance out\" with the firepower of the other participants of the Fourth Holy Grail War when he could simply end it in one night should he wish it. Kotomine comments that his notion of overlooking \"worthless and meaningless things\" is one factor that can lead to his defeat because \"there are worthless things, but there are no meaningless things.\" Shirou describes that along with his great power that he was \"given the fate of being raised with his 'carelessness' skill maxed out.\" He considers his title as a king \"constrictive\" in a sense that his pride will not allow him to go all out against people he considers to be unworthy, seeing taking such a person seriously as himself being defeated. He will refuse to use Ea against anyone unworthy, either hesitating with its usage or testing them to make sure they are worthy of it. He describes his going all out in Fate/hollow ataraxia as a once in a lifetime whim, and he would have been able to conquer the four day loop of by himself had he not turned himself into a child. Although the strongest existence among the Servants who cannot be rivaled when he is serious, he loses against Saber due to obsession, loses to Shirou due to pride, and loses to Sakura Matou due to carelessness. It can be said he is forced to bend his knees before the universal law of \"love conquers all\" in Fate/stay night, but is allowed to \"show off his overwhelming, cheat-like strength without restraint\" in Fate/Zero. He normally does not care about his attire in battle while playing, but claims there are some restrictions for a serious, dignified battle. As he does not favor hand-to-hand combat, exercising his true power only requires his body and the key to his treasury. He has the absolute self-confidence to calmly show himself before his opponents, but he is also apt to simply kill by raining Noble Phantasms behind his enemies' backs depending on his mood. The will of the king cannot be simply gauged by the concept of tactic. Saber believes the only way to stand a chance against him is to take him down before he gets serious. If he has a natural weak point besides his tendency not to fight seriously, it is that he is not a master of his weapons. He is not a \"wielder\" who has mastered his weapon to the limit, leaving some room for counters like Unlimited Blade Works. Knight of Honor is said to be a natural counter to him, though Berserker is only able to put up a fight through Mad Enhancement boosting his abilities. Gilgamesh possesses clairvoyance, taking the form of the Noble Phantasm Sha Naqba Imuru. He is extremely perceptive of magecraft, allowing him to see through Caster's fake death and tell the exact number of spells a magus is preparing just by looking at them. He is able to predict the exact number of Projections prepared by Shirou, and asks what kind of hero he would be if he could not see through a magus. He is also capable of accurately assessing his opponents' abilities. He would not even consider having a battle of swordsmanship with Assassin, and while he plays around with a weakened Saber in Fate, he immediately backs off from her to avoid hand-to-hand combat during Unlimited Blade Works after she receives a boost in power from her contract with Rin. He normally wears Golden Armor\u00a0(\u9ec4\u91d1\u306e\u7532\u5191, Kogane no Katch\u016b) materialized from magical energy much like Saber's armor. It is extremely strong to the point that Shirou initially assumes that it is his main Noble Phantasm. It has a strong innate Magic Resistance, and it is durable enough to block Tsubame Gaeshi and numerous strong blows from Saber simply by protecting his head with his hands. He eventually stops playing around despite his armor not being in any danger of giving out to her attacks. Shirou believes she would have been able to slash through it if she were to relaunch her barrage of attacks. He claims that he does not need it while playing around, and that it is only crucial for guarding against evil spirits like petrifying serpents, due to it being anti-petrification equipment, and gigantic bulls. He did not have any abilities to resist magecraft during life, so he only gains Magic Resistance as the class ability of the Archer class. He obtains C rank under Tokiomi, allowing him to completely nullify magecraft under two verses, but he is still susceptible to High Thaumaturgy and Greater Rituals. It is lowered under Kirei due to his lack of magical energy, and remains at only the minimal level, rank E, that provides light damage mitigation against magecraft rather than full neutralization. The state of his Magic Resistance matters little, as he is able to neutralize most magecraft with his many items that defend against it. His armor and a shield are able to repel A rank magecraft with ease. Overall, he is much more likely to simply unleash a raging wave of Noble Phantasms against \"mongrels\" impeding the king by attempting to use large-scale spells, completely crushing them without even giving them the time to cast.Independent Action  Gilgamesh has a high rank of Independent Action, rank A, allowing him to easily utilize his Noble Phantasms and remain in the world without Tokiomi's backup. He is able to easily ignore his Master's orders, making it possible to stroll around without making his Master aware of his whereabouts. The only way to command him is through the use of Command Spells, but his disposition that does not even contain an ounce of respect for his Master makes utilizing them idly a bad move. Utilizing Noble Phantasms of great power does require backup from his Master. After being materialized, he gains the rank of A+, completely setting him apart from the rest of the Servants by allowing him to operate without a Master. Exceeding his previous rank, the support of the Master is unnecessary even while unleashing a large amount of magical power. It is an ability that bends the rules, and it allows for his continued materialization as a Servant even after the conclusion of the Holy Grail War for ten years. While he was always able to operate without regard for his Master, gaining a physical body is what allowed for him to remain materialized after the Holy Grail War. While he accepts energy supplied by Kirei from a number of orphans, he claims that the act was unnecessary overall.Incarnation  Gilgamesh is doused in a torrent of the black mud, the incarnation of All the World's Evil, spilling from the Holy Grail during the Fourth War. His body is instantly broken down and absorbed into it, becoming one with the flow. Servants are normally corrupted and blackened upon contact, but Gilgamesh is unable to be controlled or blackened due to his powerful ego that can stave back the mental pollution. He claims that someone would need at least three times that amount to even think about affecting him. However, the incarnation inevitably makes his human side resonate with the people of the era, making him much more destructive and impulsive in the Fifth Holy Grail War compared to the Fourth. It is normally impossible for correctness and affirmations to exist with the cursed vortex of hatred because all has determined that everything is ugly and hateful, so the words \"yes\" and \"that is right\" appearing within is an anomaly. It does not allow the existence of \"entities\", so such a thing should not be possible. It questions these affirmations, and gets a response. Gilgamesh, as the king, will acknowledge that the world was originally such a way, he will permit it to be so, and he will bear the burden of sin for the entire world. It then asks \"what is a king?\", causing a contradiction in that it admitted there was someone else within it. Gilgamesh is recognized as a strange foreign object that cannot exist, and the King, a presence that is an absolute controller that has no equal, announces his presence and frees himself from the mud. The only change after being temporarily absorbed is that the saturation converts his spiritual body to one of flesh and blood like the blackened Servants. It could not digest him even after utilizing all of its hatred, so it crystallized the impurity within itself and abandoned it. He was given a corporeal body and regurgitated back into the present world. Becoming completely incarnated, he continued to survive as an existence with a physical body. Due to the connection, the Grail attempts to turn him into a host in Unlimited Blade Works in a last ditch effort to survive even though a Servant cannot become its core. It opens a black void on his body that proceeds to instantly swallow him. He managed to partially escape, but needs an anchor to keep from being sucked in completely. It begins to melt his body in various places, and the void shrinks into nothingness after he sinks into it. During Heaven's Feel after being devoured by Sakura, she quickly converted him to mana in haste because she was afraid he might tear her up from the inside if she does not digest him. It also has to do with the power behind the curse, as the \"mud\" cut off from the main body that he managed to \"beautifully escape\" and the \"shadow\" connected to the thing itself are of different quality. There is also the effect Sakura has as the Grail itself, as he was materialized under the Grail System. Regardless if he is incarnated or spiritual, he cannot resist the Grail, and due to the large amount of mana she absorbed from him, she buckled like a broken dam.Development Creation and Conception  When selecting heroes for Fate/stay night, Gilgamesh was chosen as the oldest and most obscure hero that Kinoko Nasu and Takashi Takeuchi could find in contrast to the well renowned Heracles. While there were other candidates, they liked his strong sounding name and myth. The overall concept of the character was changed very little since his initial conception. It is revealed that Gilgamesh's overall design and appearance was heavily based on Gilgamesh from the Tower of Druaga franchise. Nasu \"selfishly demanded\" that \"Gilgamesh must wear a full golden plate armour\" during the designing stage, reasoning it to be that Gilgamesh would have needed it to repeatedly challenge some sixty-story building in his era.Reception References English  \"Even though it's not like my armor is actually in danger of giving out or anything.\"Japanese  \u6211\u306e\u93a7\u304c\u8ecb\u307f\u3092\u3042\u3052\u308b\u306a\u3069\u3001\u305d\u3046\u3042\u308a\u5f97\u308b\u4e8b\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044\u306e\u3060\u304cServant  Servants\u00a0(\u30b5\u30fc\u30f4\u30a1\u30f3\u30c8, S\u0101vanto) are Heroic Spirits and Divine Spirits summoned by the Holy Grail for the purpose of competing under Masters in the Holy Grail War.Nature  Servants are Heroic Spirits made into special familiars of the highest rank that are bound to the Master. Pure Heroic Spirits, the \"main body\" in the Throne of Heroes, can only be summoned by the World, and summoning even one is considered to be a miraculous occurrence. Differing from the normal definition of familiars that can be likened to minor mascots unable to be stronger than their masters, Heroic Spirits are the most powerful of beings with which even the five magicians would never be able to forge a contract with. Rather than it being a hard process to summon them or the fact that they far surpass magi, it is their intrinsic nature in that they are beings beyond magecraft. Magi can perform rituals to borrow their power to mimic them, but cannot summon actual Heroic Spirits themselves. Even the Holy Grail lacks the power to summon a true Heroic Spirit, so the process is facilitated by summoning them into one of seven vessels prepared beforehand. The Greater Grail makes a copy using information from the \"main body\" of the Heroic Spirit, an \"emanation\", that returns to them as information, in the form of a soul, upon the death of the Servant. Disconnected from the \"main body\", they are able to know of the actions of the Servant through records, as if reading a book. Due to this, any Heroic Spirit summoned in multiple Holy Grail Wars will lack knowledge of previous summonings. The only exemption is King Arthur due to her unique circumstances. Similarly as to how daemons require a form invented by humans in order to take shape, Heroic Spirits need a form to exist in the world. The vessels, classes, act as their temporary name and method of existing. Acting like a \"passport to the present\", the vessel prepares them for their role as a familiar in advance, allows them to take on that role to help them take form, and brings them forth into the world. Each class identifies only the core skills of the Heroic Spirit because replication of all their abilities is impossible. Their main traits align with the class and are given form, matching the principal nature of the class. Only heroes matching the attributes of the classes are brought forth, allowing them to be summoned into any reflecting their abilities. Although too powerful to be controlled by humans, they are bound by three Command Spells, representing the Masters' \"right to rule\" over them, with obedience towards the Command Spells being the \"absolute condition required for materialization.\" Due to the prospect of having a wish granted by the Holy Grail, it also serves as an incentive to cooperate with the Master, as well as requiring them for energy upkeep and acting as their anchor to the world. Killing them will normally go against their purpose, but the Command Spells protect the Master from those who would kill them to seek out one who would be more suitable.Characteristics  Servants are beings able to switch between a Spiritual Body and Material Body at will. While in spiritual form, they cannot be easily detected by enemies due to being invisible to the naked eye and most forms of scrying, or be affected by physical interference. They can travel where they please without being impeded by walls, but they also cannot carry anything in that state. Their senses are limited to spiritual sensations, so they must materialize in order to fully experience normal senses when sharing a visual link with their Master. Their upkeep cost is low when not materialized, so many Masters prefer them to stay in spirit form when they are not fighting or doing other tasks that require them to be in physical form to lower the cost on themselves. Depending on the disposition of the Servant or a special case like Saber, such an order may be impossible. It is also hard for them to affect a Material Body in that state, so they must materialize to properly engage in combat. While they may bleed and take damage to their organs, their true being resides in a Spiritual Core they obtain upon first materializing. Their Material Body envelopes it, and damage must be inflicted to it in order for them to be defeated. It gradually diminishes under magical energy expenditure and while sustaining bodily damage, and their expenditure will escalate under such conditions. If it is damaged through powerful magical energy, curses, or Noble Phantasms, it will be destroyed, meaning that the Servant can no longer stay materialized. The heart and head are directly connected to it, so they are a Servant's greatest weaknesses. Sustaining damage will significantly weaken it, with some Servants having it instantly destroyed and some with Skills like Battle Continuation being able to at least temporarily sustain themselves. While they have Material Bodies like humans, the composition is drastically different. They are of a much higher magnitude, so it is normally impossible for portions to be transplanted onto a human. Shirou Emiya is able to obtain Archer's arm due to them being the same person. Normally the recipient would die of shock, but being even closer than twins allows the surgery to succeed, although Shirou needs to wear the Shroud of Martin\u00a0to supress the negative effects Archer's arm would have on his body. It is still too much for him even in that case, so being connected to it slowly kills him. Sieg, a homunculus, obtains Siegfried's heart, gaining the ability to transform and have a longer lifespan, yet his body is consumed by memories of Siegfried until it is no longer the same, ending up transforming into a dragon.Heroic Spirit Possession  Heroic Spirit Possession\u00a0(\u82f1\u970a\u6191\u4f9d) is the process of a Heroic Spirit fusing with a human in some capacity. It is possible for a Servant to possess a human, fuse with a human to become a Demi-Servant, and for a human to act as a receptacle for the facilitation of the summoning to become a Pseudo-Servant. Normally the souls of Heroic Spirits would overwhelm those of humans, making it impossible for them to intermix and grant a human the powers of the Heroic Spirit. Pure souls like those of homunculi can have a better time accepting their power and withstanding transformation of the flesh. The act of a Heroic Spirit possessing a human for even a single second can be called a miracle in itself.Alignment  All Servants have an Alignment\u00a0(\u5c5e\u6027, Zokusei), a status showing a clear representation of the mentality of the Servant, differing from the elemental alignment of magi. It is broken down into two parts, a combination of the principles they consider important to their personality. Principles are reflected as Chaotic\u00a0(\u6df7\u6c8c\uff0f\u6e3e\u6c8c, Konton/Konton), Lawful\u00a0(\u79e9\u5e8f, Chitsujo), and Neutral\u00a0(\u4e2d\u7acb, Ch\u016britsu, \"True\"), and their personalities are reflected as Good\u00a0(\u5584, Zen), Evil\u00a0(\u60aa, Waru), and Neutral\u00a0(\u4e2d\u5eb8, Ch\u016by\u014d). Berserker Servants have also displayed Insane\u00a0(\u72c2\u5316, Ky\u014dka) as a \"principle\", and Mad\u00a0(\u72c2, Ky\u014d) and Reckless\u00a0(\u66b4\u8d70, B\u014ds\u014d) as their \"personalities.\" Differences in personality will not result in major discord, but differing principles can make Servants resolving their differences of opinions difficult. While two Servants may have the same personalities as \"good\", like King Arthur and Gilgamesh, their Lawful and Chaotic principles lead to differing opinions. Others:Upkeep  Servants must maintain a certain amount of energy to remain materialized and fight, and they must have an anchor to the world, their Master or another physical being in order to remain in the world. Their current strength is reflected by their current stores of energy, so they will lose strength as they lose energy. The Grail itself provides most of the upkeep for Servants during the duration of the Holy Grail War, so Masters, granted Magical Paths to supply energy, do not need to provide vast amounts of energy normally. More energy intensive Servants like A-rank Servants and Berserker-class Servants can still pose a great threat should they not have the ability to provide their upkeep, even draining them to death in the case of Berserkers. Those who are cognizant are able to throttle the energy they intake, keeping their output to a minimum or using only their own stores when their Masters are unable to provide their full cost. If the Servant is without a Master, has issues with the Magical Paths, or has a Master unable to supply energy, they must supplement themselves elsewhere. As Human Spirits, they have the ability to consume the souls and minds of people and convert them into energy. Their basic abilities do not change from such nourishment, but they become tougher as their magical energy capacity increases. They can also intake semen or blood for energy depending on their method of processing it. Places like Ryuudou Temple can naturally allow them to subside longer, and draining directly from leylines is possible for some. With a full stock of energy, they can subside for a time even with the constant cost of upkeep, and they regain some energy from their own magic circuits daily. Remaining in spiritual form can decrease their upkeep, and while in material form, dematerializing weapons and armor can help cut it somewhat. Food can be converted to supply some energy, and sleeping can stop the consumption. This only helps when no action is taken due to even a single battle using upwards of twenty times as much energy as simply existing, so such methods are only stop-gaps compared to taking in souls. Even having a full supply will not help a Servant should they lose their anchor to the world with the loss of their Master, so they must quickly seek out another contract. While normally not much of a burden, their energy noticeably drains by the second without one. Depending on the amount of energy and upkeep cost, they may only be able to stay materialized for a brief time. Saber can manage only two hours, while Caster can last two days with a full supply of energy. Those with Independent Action are able to subside without Master support far longer than others, allowing them a better chance to seek out another contract. Much like the class container, their anchor is a \"passport to the current age\", so losing that will mean being forced to return to the \"outside.\" They cannot form proper contracts with other Servants, as spirits cannot link spirits to the World. Caster is able to summon Assassin, but it is an improper summoning with several complications; rather than her being his anchor, it is the mountain gate, so Assassin cannot leave the area. Without a Master, they are no different than regular spirits and may be affected by the Church's scripture. It is possible to remain materialized as a normal familiar after the Holy Grail War ends, but it greatly increases the cost without active support from the Grail. Rin Tohsaka, a superior magus, has no issue in providing for Saber's upkeep, Noble Phantasm usage, and Shirou Emiya's Reality Marble at the same time during the Holy Grail War, but in-turn requires the majority of her energy and Shirou's help in keeping Saber materialized after it ends in Unlimited Blade Works. The only one easily able to maintain a Servant is Sakura Matou after becoming the Grail in Heaven's Feel, granting her a limitless supply that easily allows her to maintain Rider. Gilgamesh incarnating allows him to exist indefinitely by granting him A+ Independent Action, allowing him to exist for ten years with no issues. Ruler becomes incarnated through another method, allowing him to exist for about sixty years.Knowledge  Those summoned as Servants are given the minimum information required to allow them to fit into any era. No matter how ancient the Heroic Spirit, they should understand a number of concepts that were not known in their time. The idea that Saber may be shocked about the immediate world initially worries Shirou Emiya, but the knowledge makes such worry unnecessary. Irisviel von Einzbern first believes that Saber may find flying in a plane to be an amazing experience, but it instead seems less than expected to her. Flying in a plane is also mitigated due to her Riding Skill that could potentially even grant her the ability to fly it. While not given enough information to actually drive modern vehicles, higher ranks of Riding grant the ability to manage such through intuition even if they do not actually recognize what each separate control of a vehicle will actually perform what action. Conversely, even though Ruler understands the basic principles behind the concept of a plane, she is unnerved by the idea of a mass of metal flying through the sky and only has the relief that it did not fall out of the sky after landing. With language, Rider displays the ability to speak English to his Master, Waver Velvet, and also speak Japanese to Taiga Fujimura, allowing him to easily translate between the two. The knowledge is not all-encompassing, so concepts may still have to be explained to them. Rider is shocked at the true scope of the world compared to the area he had conquered in life, and needs to have certain areas shown to him on a map. He enjoys spending his time learning about different aspects of the world such as wars since his time, and details like the price of a stealth bomber are not immediately known to him. Saber does not understand the idea of dating until it is specifically explained. They are granted knowledge on the Holy Grail ritual itself, but only as much as the outside Masters are told. They do not know of its true purpose in being a method requiring all seven to be sacrificed to reach the Root, only believing it to be a war for a single wish. The knowledge can change upon the nature of the war changing, allowing knowledge of the two teams of Servants and factions of the Great Holy Grail War to be given to them. They are not granted knowledge on other Heroes through the Grail, but rather from knowledge gained within the Throne of Heroes. Witnessing traits of other Servants can allow them to deduce their True Names with the knowledge even if they are from incompatible eras. Aberrations like Saber, who is not part of the Throne of Heroes due to her circumstances, are able to identify those whose legends would have been known to them in life, such as C\u00fa Chulainn, but cannot identify the legends of later Heroic Spirits like Gilles de Rais even after being directly named.Variations Shadow Servant  Shadow Servants\u00a0(\u30b7\u30e3\u30c9\u30a6\u30b5\u30fc\u30f4\u30a1\u30f3\u30c8) are a variety of Servant that is incomplete, degraded, or false. There are number of circumstances that bring them about such as a bad summoning or blackening. The Seven Fake Heroic Spirits created by Jeanne Alter are similar in nature.Solo Servant  Solo Servants are Servants summoned by the Moon Cell after the formal end of the Moon Holy Grail War in Fate/Extella. They exist independently without the need for a Master.Top Servant  Top Servants\u00a0(\u30c8\u30c3\u30d7\u30fb\u30b5\u30fc\u30f4\u30a1\u30f3\u30c8, Toppu S\u0101vanto) are the most powerful \"heroes among heroes\" in human history who represent the pinnacles of Heroic Spirits. When summoned by the Moon Cell to deal with threats like the awakening of Velber 02 in Fate/Extella, they are said to be summoned in a special class different from the normal classes. Known Top Servants include Arjuna, Artoria, Gilgamesh, Iskandar, Karna, Joan of Arc, Romulus, Scathach, and C\u00fa Chulainn.Summoning  Masters summon their Servants at the start of each ritual. Different system possess different means of facilitating the summoning.Fuyuki-based Systems  Under systems based upon the Fuyuki ritual, there are several factors that determine which Heroic Spirit the Master will summon. It is general that the seven participating Masters are all magi due to requiring basic magecraft to properly perform the summoning, but the quality of the Masters does not matter so long as the most basic summoning requirements are met to fill out the Grail's requirement of seven Servants being manifested. Upon selecting the Masters, the Grail distributes the massive amount of magical energy it has gathered among them to facilitate the process. Performing a summoning ritual facilitates the process in which the copy of the Heroic Spirit is brought into the chosen class container. Most Masters will prepare a catalyst with which to summon their desired Heroic Spirit, but it is not absolutely necessary. Without a specific artifact, the Grail will, rather than base it on their power, choose a Servant based upon similarities to the summoner's own nature. When choosing based on power with a catalyst, bad compatibility may make forming a bond impossible, bringing about hardships without being able to have faith in each other. When allowing for a good affinity, it may bring forth a weaker Servant, and it is possible that a single mistake could rouse bad feelings between them due to the resemblance in their personalities being so close.Summoning Ritual  While the summoning ritual\u00a0(\u5100\u5f0f\u306e\u53ec\u559a, gishiki no sh\u014dkan) are generally specific, their main goal in the Holy Grail War system is to act as a precaution to create a bond with a perfect, reliable Servant. They really only require a summoning circle, even if unskilled, and a catalyst can bypass the need of chanting a spell. Doing so can create aberrations like Gilles de Rais being placed into a normally unsuitable class or King Arthur having a bad connection with her Master that does not allow her to receive magical energy through normal methods. Flatt Escardos is a complete anomaly in that he is able to complete the ritual without even meaning to summon a Servant, simply by \"fiddling\" with the magical energy in the area. The connection to his Servant is spontaneously established, and it is unknown if it can be called a miracle, luck, or an achievement of his own latent potential. It is possible to specify in the summoning ritual that the Servant be placed under the Berserker class for those familiar with the workings of the Grail System. By adding in a specific line,\u00a0Zouken Matou\u00a0and the\u00a0Einzbern\u00a0family, as members of the Three Founding Families, were able to choose this class during the Fourth and Fifth Wars respectively. In the Great Holy Grail War, each faction has a summoning ritual according to the color they represent.Catalyst  Catalysts\u00a0(\u89e6\u5a92, Shokubai) are symbols and holy relics used to attract the desired Heroic Spirit. Requiring something with a connection to the hero, it can be anything from a sword, armor, a talisman, or even their bones. While something like Rin's Pendant is an artifact holding great power on its own, it is unable to help summon a Servant. If the catalyst is one that is particularly weak, or if it is one with a connection to many different Heroic Spirits, the Heroic Spirit among the candidates that has good affinity with the Master will be chosen. Some are those that have only been connected to a single Heroic Spirit, allowing them to be brought forth regardless of affinity with the Master. Catalysts are extremely valuable, and it can take much effort depending on the Servant the Master wishes to summon. The Mage's Association, having been collecting the esoterica of thaumaturgy for generations since ancient times, has a grand number of catalysts \"numbering among the stars.\" Kayneth El-Melloi Archibald is able to order a relic from Macedonia, while the Einzberns have to specifically have Avalon excavated from Cornwall. Within the Fate/Apocrypha world, the spread of the Holy Grail War system means many catalysts quickly disappearing over seventy years and numerous Grail Wars. Especially those of Gilgamesh, King Arthur, and Alexander the Great have been scattered and lost over time, and Yggdmillennia specifically collects desired artifacts over decades to procure enough excellent Heroic Spirits. The Association still has enough even then to easily provide seven catalysts to their Red Faction on a short notice. Examples of catalysts include: General catalysts include:Servants summoning Servants  It is also possible for some Servants to bring forth other Servants under limited conditions with their own abilities and Noble Phantasms:Limitations  Within the Fuyuki Holy Grail War system, there is a rule that makes only the summoning of Western Heroic Spirits possible due to the Holy Grail being a Western, Christian concept and that the summoning system was created in the world of Western magi.Sasaki Kojiro of the Fifth Holy Grail War is a complete aberration in many ways. Other systems like the Moon Cell Holy Grail War have no such restrictions. Under normal circumstances, the Fuyuki ritual is made for the summoning of only \"pure Heroic Spirits\", so with the exception of Hassan-i-Sabbah, those who are \"mixed spirits\" \"who only have the aspect of a Heroic Spirit\" cannot be summoned. Through the induction of Angra Mainyu into the Grail after the Third Holy Grail War in the main timeline and the alterations made by Darnic Prestone Yggdmillennia in the alternate timeline of the Great Holy Grail War, it becomes possible to summon those with anti-hero aspects. That limitation is not present in other Holy Grail Wars like the Moon Cell Holy Grail War. Divine Spirits cannot be summoned normally under most systems. Due to their nature, it is nearly impossible for them to manifest in the current world.Strength  Servants have six primary statistics that make up their overall strength: Each of the statistics and Skills are translated into specific parameters, reflecting the individual ability of each Servant. They display strength and speed far beyond normal humans, showing in battle displays likened to a \"dimension that is completely at odds with the physical laws of this world.\" Simple hand-to-hand combat between two Servants is enough to wreck a city street in a manner able to be compared to having been carpet-bombed, damaging the ground with only their footfalls, cutting metal with only the backlash caused by their weapons clashing, and tearing away iron from simply brushing against it with weapons. The usage of their Noble Phantasms can easily leave an area in complete ruin, some displaying the capability to easily wreck part of a city with minimum usage or even an entire city should enough time pass. Both their movement speed and dexterity is enough to make them invisible to the human eye, looking like a breeze of wind when running past and only leaving the aftershocks of their attacks to be felt by onlookers. Compared to even a top-class motorcycle like Saber's V-Max able to reach over four hundred kilometers per hour, the dexterity of a Servant places them far above it in both maximum acceleration and speed, and they can rival a jet fighter in speed with proper footwork. It may be still advantageous to use a motorized vehicle in a pursuit due to it only relying on its fuel rather than using their own energy while running on foot. The speed of bullets travelling faster than the speed of sound poses no threat, unable to surpass the speed with which they wield their weapons, and those with greater dexterity can easily deflect them with their weapons. Not bound by normal logic, they are able to move up the sides of buildings simply by kicking off the sides. Even the smallest of Servants will have little issue in carrying a person, and Rider, casually copying something out of a comic, is able to lift a vehicle from a construction site to slam down onto her opponents. Even those who are physically weak compared to others like Caster-class Servants show great feats of strength, Gilles de Rais displaying grip strength enough to easily crush a human skull and Medea severing an arm with a ritualistic dagger unable to normally even be considered lethal to a regular human. Masters who have made contracts with Servants have the ability to read out the status of a Servant with powers of clairvoyance. It is a unique ability granted by the Grail that summoned the Heroic Spirits, so it cannot be used by those without a contract. They can see through the abilities of the other Servants and compare them to those of their own so that they can guide them as efficiently as possible in battle situations. Tokiomi Tohsaka owned a book that provides a similar ability, but it is useless to a full Master. It was passed on to Rin Tohsaka after his death, and she gives it to Shirou Emiya because he lacks a proper connection to Saber. The book itself is blank, but simply looking at a random page gives him an image in his head that allows him to look upon all known statuses of the Servants in the War. Reading the book will give him new details any time he reads it, and Rin says that he will be able to identify Servants from intuition without using the book after he gets used to it. It is reflected in-game as the Servant status screen.Factors  The strength of the summoned Servants depends on various factors. It is ideal if the Servant can wield their original power as a Heroic Spirit, but it is also possible that they can even surpass their original selves in the case of the attribute enhancement from Mad Enhancement of the Berserker class. It is also possible to obtain abilities from Class Skills they did not originally have in life, such as Riding modern vehicles, or have their own attributes strengthened by their classes' natural attributes.Strengthening Ascension  Under the FATE system, it is possible for Servants to undergo Ascension\u00a0(\u970a\u57fa\u518d\u81e8, Reimoto Sairin, Spirit Foundation Second Coming), a reform for the Servants to become stronger by coming closer to their \"starting point of conception.\" It may even bring about a younger, more inexperienced form without reducing their power as a Servant because it is the \"most fitting figure\" for them.Form Change  Form Change: Altered Morphology\u00a0(, ) is an element present in Fate/Extella that allows for Servants to be strengthened in battle, altering their outward appearance and weapons. This is only given to the wielders of the Regalia, rings that symbolize the Royal Authority of SE.RA.PH, given to Servants who have won a Moon Cell Holy Grail War.Mythological Mystic Code  Within the Moon Cell, unlocking their Origin as a legend within a Servant grants them great power on the same scale as the Ten Crowns possessed by BB, granting them a Mythological Mystic Code\u00a0(\u795e\u8a71\u793c\u88c5, Shinwa Reis\u014d).Battle  Battles between Servants can be called a process of gradually shaving off the magical energy that forms their bodies. Attacks that consume a great amount of magical energy will inflict a massive amount of damage on the opponent, but it will also weaken the attacker in the process. In order to inflict a great amount of damage with minimum expenditure of magical energy, it is necessary for them to collect intelligence regarding the enemy and assault their weakness. The greatest weapon is their Noble Phantasm, and a battle between Servants can often be called a battle between Noble Phantasms. When describing their strength, they can be likened to a single jet fighter in pure attack power, far beyond the ability for a single person to fight. While strong, they would have to refuel many times in order to destroy a city. Though there are many modern weapons that are more powerful, their status as spiritual bodies makes them among the most powerful due to being immune to modern weapons. Their Noble Phantasms can be likened to a jet's ability to load a nuclear warhead far beyond its normal fighting power, with some Servants having extremely powerful ones. With Servants, those with an \"extremely average Noble Phantasm\" would have one around the level of B Rank which has strength able to be represented through numbers. Broken Phantasms, Invisible Air, and Gae Bolg's thrown strike all deal pure physical damage, while Gae Bolg's piercing version carries a conceptual effect able to kill opponents of a much higher level than the wielder.True Name  The True Name\u00a0(\u771f\u540d, Shinmei) of a Servant is something vital to battle, as it can reveal much about them. They most often have their Masters refer to them solely by their class name unless they do not care like Assassin of Black, wish to have a closer connection to their Master like Caster after she reveals her identity, or are under circumstances where it no longer matters like those trapped in the Sakura Labyrinth. There are Servants and Masters with extreme confidence or no filter in revealing their True Names for all to hear, such as Rider exclaiming his name without regard and Illyasviel von Einzbern having supreme confidence in Berserker even with his name revealed. Their names can reveal certain traits about their abilities, allowing for specific countermeasures, and there are many famous heroes that had met untimely deaths in life. Those killed by poison will be more susceptible to it, those shot down by arrows will be weak against them, those with weak spots will be severely disadvantaged if they are targeted, and those with traits like being weak to monster-slayers or dragon-slaying weapons can be specifically damaged in accordance. Even without such a specific countermeasure being available to one Master, releasing that information to the other Masters can allow for other countermeasures to be brought forth. Most Masters should know instantly of their own Servants' identities, but something like Secret of Pedigree can block even that, and the refusal of a Servant to disclose it can keep them from knowing. In the case of a weak Master susceptible to mind control, they may forgo telling them altogether until necessary. Famous heroes like King Arthur and Siegfried are very likely to have their identities found out more easily than others, with simply glancing upon Excalibur being enough for any Heroic Spirit to identify King Arthur. Others need to utilize their Noble Phantasms before they reveal themselves, but it may require deductive reasoning even then. While the oldest legendary hero Gilgamesh is able to show off his Noble Phantasms without many being able to guess, and despite his belief that it should be obvious to others, he generally discloses it himself. Someone like Archer, being a Counter Guardian from the future and displaying numerous Noble Phantasms with Unlimited Blade Works, is a complete anomaly to others, greatly confusing all who fight him with his contradictory traits that do not match any known hero. There are also those without specific weaknesses whose True Names will bring no trouble if revealed, like Astolfo. There may be slight variations to the True Names depending on different circumstances:Affinity  Affinity between Servants can factor into battles.Humans and Modern Weaponry  As spiritual beings and divine mysteries, Servants cannot be harmed by normal means and are still considered spirits even in physical form, so they cannot be physically harmed by regular humans or modern weaponry. They can only be harmed by attacks accompanied by magical energy like a Servant throwing dirks imbued with magical energy, so they can ignore even debris in battle unless it should become contaminated by an enemy's magical energy. Only Servants can normally harm other Servants physically, so even a paper knife could be used to harm a Servant should another Servant wield it. Servants that are physically incarnated through methods such as blackening can no longer return to spiritual form, allowing them to be damaged with strong enough magical weapons able to pierce the shadows surrounding them in the case of blackening. For a human trying to apply pressure to a Servant, even one physically the size of a child, it feels like trying to bend a steel beam. Punches with all of their strength will not even cause a Servant to budge a millimeter, and even Souichirou Kuzuki, whose punch is potent enough to crush a human's skull, can only slightly move Archer's head from the impact. Stabbing them with a knife does nothing but bring about a \"prickling irritation\" that does not hurt at all. They can by harmed by physical attacks strengthened magically through Reinforcement or enough Command Spells. \"Mere bullets\" normally pose no threats to Servants regardless of the caliber, but firearms wielded as regular weapons by Servants like Francis Drake's pistols are able to inflict damage, and those ascended to the rank of Noble Phantasm like through Lancelot's Knight of Owner can prove lethal with a single shot.Other opponents  Beings other than Servants that are able to combat Servants are few in modern times. Beings such as Arcueid Brunestud at 30% of her strength, Amaterasu, and Kingprotea would always generally win against a single Servant due to their overwhelming ability. Arcueid could potentially be overwhelmed by two Servants fighting at once even though she is around four times as strong as one, while Amaterasu and Kingprotea require the strength of several Servants to be defeated. If speaking of a Servant with an extremely average Noble Phantasm, the members of the Twenty Seven Dead Apostle Ancestors, Kouma Kishima, and Aoko Aozaki can fight directly, while Ciel and Shiki Ryougi's third personality can keep up in a defensive fight that can still be called a fight. Ryougi's normal personality and Shiki Tohno have no chance of matching Servants, but the Mystic Eyes of Death Perception they carry are capable of affecting such beings whether they are incarnated or spiritual bodies. Humans utilizing ten Command Spells would also be able to damage Servants.Kirei Kotomine and Kiritsugu Emiya at the peak of their strengths during the Fourth Holy Grail War could defeat Servants, but only when the weakest, Caster and Assassin, are at their most exposed, or when they have special conditions in their favor like surprise or suitability against the opponent. Against Dead Apostle Ancestors, both are types of beings that live in Mystery, so such battles would come down to \"having the means of killing the other guy somehow.\" Servants will generally hold a slight advantage, barring compatibility issues, and the Knight classes, Saber, Archer, and Lancer, will all be able to have solid fights. While Saber's Excalibur is extremely effective against those who overwhelm by material quantity and alienness, there are those capable of surviving being hit by Excalibur-class attacks through pure endurance. At the same time, those same ones with extreme endurance would have a tough time with Lancer's G\u00e1e Bolg.ORT, to which Earth's rules do not apply, and Primate Murder, which has an advantage against primates and requires seven Counter Guardians to control, can be called in a league of their own above both Ancestors and Servants.Classification  Heroic Spirits summoned by the Holy Grail are placed into one of various classes. The seven standard classes are the Three Knight\u00a0(\u4e09\u9a0e\u58eb, Sankishi) classes of Saber, Lancer, Archer, and the Four Cavalry\u00a0(\u56db\u9a0e, Shiki) classes of Rider, Caster, Assassin, and Berserker. There are also non-standard Extra Classes\u00a0(\u30a8\u30af\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30af\u30e9\u30b9, Ekusutora Kurasu) that are \"split off from the regular servant classes in order to take on certain roles\", such as Ruler which oversees the Holy Grail War. Under the Fuyuki-based rituals, it is said that only the Three Knight classes will definitely be summoned according to the framework of the ritual, allowing for variation in the rest of the classes. Classes are said to have occasionally changed between the various Fuyuki Holy Grail Wars. More than one version of the same class cannot be summoned, even if all the Masters were to use the variation in the summoning chant to get a Berserker-class Servant for example. Under the Snowfield Holy Grail War, the Saber-class does not even exist. Under the Moon Cell Holy Grail War, there are 128 Servants summoned at once, so there are many Servants sharing the same classes. Servants are normally only of the singular class under which they are summoned, but certain circumstances allow for multiple classes at once or class changes. Elizabeth B\u00e1thory and Li Shuwen undergo unconventional changes to the Berserker class. Assassin Servant Henry Jekyll and Berserker Servant Hyde can switch between each other at will with their Noble Phantasm Dangerous Game, and Tokugawa Ieyasu can switch between all seven classes based on his retainers with his Noble Phantasm. Double Summon allows for two classes to be utilized simultaneously, limited only to the Cavalry classes and \"modern classes\" like Gunner. Joan of Arc Alter displays the ability to bestow the \"benefits of Berserkers\" upon Servants, such as making Saber Servant Le Chevalier d'Eon into \"Berserk-Saber.\" Elizabeth B\u00e1thory (Brave) possesses the Skill \"Double Class\" from being the result of a fusion between her Lancer and Caster counterparts, but the ability has no special characteristics. While not actually changing classes, it is possible to visually alter the class of a Servant in the Moon Cell, such as Jinako Carigiri changing Karna's class from Lancer to Launcher.Known Servants Fuyuki Holy Grail War  The events of the Fuyuki Holy Grail Wars are detailed in several stories.

Gilles de Rais manages to bring forth Joan of Arc Alter as a corrupted manifestation of Joan of Arc by using the Holy Grail. She then summons five more Servants, becoming their Master and giving them all the attribute of Berserker.

He is the adopted son of Kiritsugu Emiya, the adopted brother of Illyasviel Von Einzbern and the younger self of EMIYA.Profile Background  Ten years before the start of Fate/stay night, Shirou was an ordinary boy living with his parents in Shinto. The great fire caused by the contents of the Holy Grail spilling out at the end of the Fourth Holy Grail War killed both his parents and left him mortally wounded within the blaze. He was rescued by Kiritsugu Emiya, who was dejected after indirectly causing the fire and, wishing to actually \"save\" someone for the first time in his life, rescued Shirou by embedding Avalon in his body. He then later asked the recovering Shirou if he would like to become his adopted son, fully disclosing his identity as a magus. Shirou agreed and spent the next two years persistently asking Kiritsugu to teach him Magecraft. Kiritsugu eventually complied, and though he disapproved of Shirou's desire to learn his craft, he advised applying it in secret, where it could only benefit people and not attract confusion or suspicion. The knowledge he imparted to Shirou was very basic and incomplete, leading him down a dangerous path with little results. Furthermore, and perhaps inadvertently, Kiritsugu passed on his philosophy of wishing to be a Hero of Justice capable of saving anyone to Shirou. Five years prior to the fifth Holy Grail War, weakening every day due the effect of black mud from the Holy Grail, Kiritsugu dies, leaving Shirou frustrated, depressed, and alone. He was subsequently watched over by Taiga Fujimura, Shirou's longtime neighbor and his English teacher, and his living expenses were managed by her grandfather, Raiga Fujimura. He later went to a middle school where he encountered Matou Shinji around October of his second year when he had to remake the signboard of the culture festival according to the design of third year students in a single evening. Shinji, who oversaw that throughout the evening, said \u201cHmm\u2026 you\u2019re an idiot but you actually do a pretty good job.\u201d and started to laugh. After starting in Homurahara High School, he met Issei Ryuudou and became known as someone who would readily do anything to help others, such as fixing the school equipment. He later joined the Archery Club, which led to an estranged relationship with Shinji. He missed the target only once during the period that he was enrolled, but even then he said that he saw that \u201cit will miss\u201d before even shooting it. He withdrew during the summer of his first year due to a bone fracture in his right shoulder he received during his part-time job, which left a burn mark over the skin. The wound itself was nothing major, but Shinji pointed out that it was unsightly for someone with a burn mark to do a formal shooting, so he left the club as it was also a period when he was busy with his part-time job. Their relationship eventually stabilized, but some tension still remained, especially in regard to Shinji's abuse of Sakura Matou. Shirou also got closer to Sakura as she started to visit his household frequently during the period while he was injured in order to help him cook and clean up the house. Even after he was healed, she continued to come as a member of his surrogate family.Appearance  In the events of Fifth Holy Grail War, Shirou is a teenager with auburn hair and golden-brown coloured eyes. He is often seen wearing his casual clothing, consisting of a blue and white long sleeve baseball jersey T-shirt and a blue slim straight jeans. During school, he wears his Homurahara Academy uniform but underneath his jacket uniform, he wears the same long sleeve baseball jersey T-shirt. In Heaven's Feel scenario, Shirou gains a new body designed by Touko Aozaki. His puppet body is noted to match his original body closely. He wears a long sleeve shirt with black trousers. In Ufotable adaptation of Fate/stay night [Unlimited Blade Works], Shirou has a lot more variety of clothing. For instance, Shirou wears a black and white jersey zip jacket along with his casual clothing. He wears a charcoal coloured thomson tartan lambswool scarf along with his school uniform. Other than his casual clothing, he is seen wearing a long sleeve white shirt and a black hooded coat. He also wears a black long sleeve shirt.Personality  Due to the trauma he suffered during the great fire, Shirou has a constant emptiness in his personality and suffers from tremendous survivor's guilt. He feels that, as the only survivor, it is unfair to the deceased to prioritize his own needs before those of others. He has a distorted sense of values where he only finds self-worth from helping people without any compensation, feeling that the very act \u201chelping people\u201d is its own reward. He believes it is highly unfair that some people survive and others do not. When it comes down to receiving an injury or even giving up his life to help someone, he will do it without a second thought. The people who see this side of him are often very worried and attempt to correct his behavior, though they are unable to change his opinions. Kiritsugu often talked about how he used strive to protect the innocent from the world's many perils, even at the cost of his own humanity, and how he was saddened by the reality that whenever he was able to spare one life, another person was fated to die. Although Kiritsugu was tormented by his inability to save everyone, Shirou always admired his efforts. Right before Kiritsugu's death, Shirou pledged to be a Hero of Justice in Kiritsugu's place and strive to protect everyone at the cost of his own life. Everything that he is thus far is the result of that very pledge. He has made it his dream to become a \"Hero of justice\" who will save everyone regardless of what happens to his own life. Shirou pushes his ideals to their limit during the Fate scenario, where he constantly attempts to protect Saber from harm and keep her from fighting other Servants, despite the fact that she is many times more powerful than he and that even his odds of mere survival, not winning, are hopelessly low against those he personally fights. This is because he cannot stand the idea of someone else being harmed for his sake. He never gives up his ideals during the route and injures himself numerous times to uphold it. During the Unlimited Blade Works route, Shirou, through constant arguing with Archer, begins to see the hypocrisy in his ideals. Though he refuses to give them up entirely, he works his way towards a middle ground where he will strive towards fulfilling ideals, despite knowing they are impossible to achieve. He faces his largest dilemma during Heaven's Feel, where he is forced to choose between maintaining his ideals and protecting the life of Sakura. He eventually forsakes them, with the exception of the \"Superhero\" ending, where he becomes as resolute as Kiritsugu in his prime, allowing Sakura to be executed for the greater good. He strives only to protect Sakura, though he is presented with conflict a number of times. Shirou is extremely stubborn once he sets out to accomplish something, such as spending hours attempting to perform a high jump that is nearly impossible for him. This action, as watched by Rin and Sakura, is one of the initial factors that causes them both to develop feelings for Shirou. He will stubbornly defend his own viewpoints, no matter how wrong they may seem to others, even to the point of causing them great mental anguish. Though he does his best to help others, if he feels that a person brought about their own ruin, he will simply watch instead of helping. Nasu has stated that Shirou and Shiki Tohno would not get along.Relationships  Shirou's love interests varies from Saber, Rin and Sakura depending on the routes. However, he has shown to be initially attracted to Saber, having a crush on her, from the moment he saw her after she's summoned, regardless of the route. In Fate, Shirou eventually fully accepts his feelings for Saber, and even desires to be with her, despite her being unable to exist in the mortal world. In Unlimited Blade Works, Shirou develops feelings towards Rin during their alliance and eventually becomes her boyfriend. In Heaven's Feel, his feelings for Sakura become major plot point, when he realizes her growing beauty and develops feelings for her even before the beginning of the Grail Wars, which drastically alters all of the following events and eventually leads him to forsake his long held ideals of becoming a Hero of Justice in order to save her. Shirou quickly develops a rivalry with Archer after their first meeting, and is shown to be jealous of Archer's relationship with Rin in the Unlimited Blade Works route. Shirou also grudgingly believes Archer is cooler than him. Shirou is initially fearful of Illya but can become fiercely protective of her when they're not acting as enemies. This is even before he discovers they are step-siblings. In addition to Saber, Rin and Sakura, Shirou is also attracted to Rider.Hobbies  Shirou possesses an extraordinary talent for housework. Despite having Taiga as his caretaker, he generally cooks all of her meals and does almost all of the housework while she generally does nothing. Home cooking is his forte, and he especially prides himself in Japanese cuisine. He is not a cheapskate when it comes to ingredients to make a delicious meal, and he will spend a great deal of time in order to make something extravagant. He teaches Sakura how to cook and as she improves, they eventually start to compete over the quality of their meals. Shirou equally enjoys Japanese tea, black tea, and coffee, but he prefers Japanese tea and dislikes plum kelp tea. There are times when he receives liquor from Copenhagen, but he merely tastes it as he is not good with alcohol. Among the characters of Fate, he is one of the heaviest eaters, losing only to Saber, Berserker, and Lancer. According to him: \u201cone who does not have the stomach to digest breakfast is a failure as a martial artist.\u201d Despite having his household finances taken care of by Taiga, Shirou does not wish to feel like a freeloader, so he has been taking up part-time jobs since middle school in order to pay for his own expenses. He earns 950 yen per hour at Copenhagen, and he receives spending money from accompanying Raiga Fujimura when he participates in his hobbies, which include sumo wrestling and hunting. Shirou does not feel comfortable in the atmosphere of a Game Center. He is weak against blind dates, even though he likes them. He has never gone to the dentist. His English language skills are poor and his intended major is initially in the field of law and politics. He likes repairing electronics to help practice his Magecraft, and he can become immersed for hours at a time while fixing appliances. Due to the fact that he almost never denies requests to repair appliances or work, such as cleaning the school's swimming pool before its opening, he has many nicknames such as \u201cfake school janitor\u201d, \u201cin charge of mending\u201d, \u201cvacuum cleaner of the Archery Club\u201d and \u201cHomurahara\u2019s brownie\u201d. He likes to meditate within the dojo in his household, often to relax before or after practicing Magecraft. While at school, he aims to be the greatest at the \u201cwho will give up first\u201d type of contest. He once participated in sepak takraw along with Ryuudou Issei and Matou Shinji during a school festival. They advanced to the finals, but when they competed with the team formed by Kane Himuro, Ayaka Sajyou and Ayako Mitsuzuri, Issei caused a quarrel after being harassed with concentrated attacks and caused both teams to be disqualified.Role Fate/Zero  He appears near the end of the story. He lost his family to the great fire caused by the Grail, as he laid on the floor trying to reach out to someone. Kiritsugu found him and thanked him. Shirou was envious of Kiritsugu when he saw him happily cried in tears as if he was saved. After being rescued by Kiritsugu from the inferno, he is adopted as Kiritsugu's son. Shirou felt more comfortable calling Kiritsugu \"old-man\"\u00a0(\u723a\u3055\u3093, jii-san) than \"father\" or \"dad\". In the anime adaptation, he is seen settling into the Emiya residence. In the Drama CD, Shirou kept experiencing nightmares. Shirou would take the medicine that Kiritsugu made with magecraft. Shirou asks Kiritsugu about teaching him magecraft but Kiritsugu was completely against it. Five years later, while gazing at the stars in the Emiya estate. Kiritsugu tells Shirou of his dream to be a Hero of Justice and how he failed. Shirou, in admiration, states that he will achieve Kiritsugu's ideal and this allows Kiritsugu to die peacefully.Fate/stay night  See Main Route Articles for Shirou's role during the scenarios: Fate, Unlimited Blade Works and Heaven's Feel Shirou is a Student of Year 2 Class C of Homurahara School during Fate/stay night. He has no interest in the Holy Grail and instead despises its use. However, he is determined to win the Holy Grail War with Saber for he hopes his efforts will ensure that another disaster like the Fuyuki conflagration will never occur again. At the End of the Fate scenario, he continues to pursue his dreams of being a \"Hero of Justice\" and hope to unite with Saber all while leading a regular life. After the True End of Unlimited Blade Works route, he was working part-time at the mansion of Rin's rival Luviagelita Edelfelt. Shirou does not end up as his alternative future self at the end of the three scenarios.Manga  The manga adaptation of the visual novel follows the Fate route with a mixture of events from Unlimited Blade Works. It follows the events of Fate normally until the defeat of Rider. Instead of Shirou being immediately kidnapped by Ilya while Saber is weakened, Saber manages to recover somewhat from her use of Excalibur before the Emiya household is assaulted by Caster. Using Taiga as a hostage, Caster successfully uses Rule Breaker on Saber and takes her as her Servant after Shirou was unable to make a quick decision. When Rin tells Shirou that he is no longer a master and should not be involved any further, Shirou becomes depressed and becomes confused with what to do (noted: Shirou's feelings for Saber continue to develop). Feeling depressed over his loss and worried over Saber, Shirou goes to the Church for shelter. At the Church, Kotomine tells Shirou that his decision to sacrifice Saber was the right choice. Enraged, hearing such a thing Shirou counters Kotomine, saying that that (sacrifice Saber) was wrong and that he never truly gave her up. Kotomine then counters Shirou saying that not accepting what he did was the real betrayal. Kotomine then reveals to Shirou that his father Emiya Kiritsugu was also a Master in the Holy Grail Wars and that he was the victor. Shirou was both shocked and horrified even further after being told the truth. Kotomine tells Shirou that Kiritsugu was the man who kill all the other masters and caused Kotomine's first death in order to attain the Grail, and making Shirou believe that Kiritsugu was the one responsible for the huge fire that killed so many people ten years ago (although this is only half true, as Kotomine was the one who made the wish to make everyone in the area disappear). Following this, Shirou begins to have visions of Saber thanks to his mental link with her. Shirou then decides to come out of hiding and rescue Saber. Kotomine then acknowledges Shirou as Kiritsugu's son and secretly swears to end Shirou's life personally. Shirou tracks down Caster and Kuzuki only to be beaten by Rin and Archer. During the battle while Rin attempts to reach Kuzuki, and Caster overwhelms Archer until she temporarily retreats upon Archer starting to unleash Unlimited Blade Works. Kuzuki bringing a defeated Rin stops the battle, and Archer is forced to also become Caster's Servant in exchange for Rin's safety. Caster reneges on the promise by ordering Saber to slay Rin, but Shirou saves Rin and takes her to safety just in time. After the loss of Archer, Shirou and Rin are approached by Lancer, who has come to offer some help. They attack Caster and Kuzuki who have taken over the Church. While initially overwhelmed, Archer, having been waiting for his chance to kill Caster, assassinates both her and Kuzuki before turning his attention to Shirou. Shirou who has become disgusted with Archer, engages Archer demanding why Archer hates him so much, The two are stopped by Rin who manages to convince Archer from killing Shirou by talking it out. Rather than Rin forming a contract with Saber, Shirou manages to become her Master again, while Rin becomes Archer's Master again. It continues to follow the Fate route afterward, Shirou's feelings for Saber continue to develop and her for him as well.Fate/hollow ataraxia  Shirou, as Saber's master, is the winner of the Fifth Holy Grail War, having opted to destroy the Grail. Half a year later, he continues to live a peaceful life with the other Servants and Masters in Fuyuki. However, the peace is broken when the Heaven's Feel is unexpectedly restarted, despite the destruction of the Grail. Shirou then decides to patrol the town with Saber to investigate the dangers of the restarted war. Shirou soon discovers though that everyone is trapped within a loop of four days, thus resolving to put an end to the loop. In the meantime, He finds himself repeatedly encountering a mysterious sliver-haired girl when going out alone at night. However, he is unable to properly interact with her as he is quickly killed by a horde of beast-like shadows, resetting the loop back to the first day. Additionally, Shirou and Saber encounter a new Master and Servant: Bazett Fraga McRemitz and the mysterious Avenger, who are participating in a war unrecognized by the others. Unfortunately, Shirou and Saber are both killed in this encounter, resetting the loop once again. Shirou learns from Rin, after returning from London, that both the loop and the restarted war may possibly be the result of the Holy Grail granting someone's wish. Later, Shirou encounters the sliver haired girl once again who reveals her name as Caren Hortensia, and that she already knows who Shirou is. However, like the times before, a horde of beast-like shadows attacks, only this time though they are beaten by Shirou and Caren. After defeating the horde, Caren tells Shirou to meet her at the Church to further discuss the situation occuriing in Fuyuki. Meeting Caren at the Church, she begins to relay information regarding the loop and the restarted war. Caren reveals that the events occuring within the loop are artificial, though she says the people themselves are real except for one. She also reveals that she was sent to investigate the Holy Grail and the nature of the restarted Heaven's Feel. Furthermore, she tells Shirou that as the winner of the Fifth Holy Grail War only he can end this new war, as it is a reenactment of the fifth so it must end with his victory. Shirou then leaves the church after being told by Caren to ask Rin about London. Shirou questions Rin about London, to which she eventually reveals the existence of twin manors built during the third war to be used as seperate hideouts for the Edelfelt sisters. She further recounts that one of the manors was where she discovered the murder scene of Lancer's original Master. Prompted by this information, Shirou goes to one of the manors to ascertain it as Bazett's hideout. However, he finds the place to be empty, though he does discover one of Lancer's earrings. Taking the earring with him, Shirou goes to the harbor to get Lancer's assistance against Bazett, using the earring to convince him. Agreeing to kill Bazett, Shirou and Lancer meet up at the church courtyard before midnight, where they encounter Bazett and Avenger. Lancer and Bazett confront each other brieflly, which ends with them giving each other fatal wounds with their Noble Phantasms. With Bazett's death Shirou believes that both the loop and the restarted war will now end, though he is surprised that Avenger still exist despite his master being dead. The horde of shades then appears, yet their focus is only on Avenger. Avenger then begins to turn into one of the shades, but he manages to tell Shirou to speak with the Heaven's Cup, imploring Shirou to destroy real him, before his transformation is complete. Realizing what Avenger may mean, Shirou visits Illya to get answers. She reveals that the Holy Grail that reproduced the war is a true wish granter compared to the Holy Grail of the Einzberns. She further reveals that the Grail is actually Avenger, which is located at the moon. It is also discovered that Shirou is actually Avenger taking his form. Now knowing his true identity, Shirou returns to being Avenger, and with Caren, goes up to the Grail to end the loop. Outside the loop, the real Shirou is tricked into letting Bazett stay at his house.Fate/unlimited codes  He is given the title Apprentice Mage\u00a0(\u898b\u7fd2\u3044\u9b54\u8853\u5e2b, Mitarai Majutsushi) in Fate/unlimited codes.Carnival Phantasm  Shirou has a large role in Carnival Phantasm due to being the main character of Fate/stay night. He often interacts with his love interests, and a large plot deals with him attempting to date them simultaneously in order to make all of them happy. It is also shown that, despite what Nasu has stated, he and Shiki Tohno are very good friends and often collude with each other to keep the girls happy.Today's Menu for Emiya Family  Shirou is the main character of Today's Menu for Emiya Family, which features mostly Shirou (and occasionally, other characters) cooking various Japanese and/or Chinese dishes while explaining how they're made. A young Shirou also makes an appearance in Episode 6. Shirou's face becomes obscured in episodes that center around Archer, as demonstrated in Episode 11.Capsule Servant  In Capsule Servant, he appears in his younger appearance and a playable character.Other appearances  In the Fate/Apocrypha universe, the Fourth Holy Grail War didn't occur, Shirou is still living in Fuyuki with his original surname unchanged. His personality is a lot closer to his Capsule Servant counterpart. Still having an honest and upright personality, and likely going through days with a love comedy-like tone, along with a twin-tail magic-fist user and her cheerful little sister who laughs like a high-class young lady. In the Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA\u2606ILLYA series, Shirou has two alternate versions of himself: Miyu's brother and Illya's brother. Shirou makes an appearance in Fate/Grand Order as a Craft Essence card. He appears as the illustration cover for Projection Magecraft\u00a0(\u6295\u5f71\u9b54\u8853, T\u014dei Majutsu) and Limited/Zero Over\u00a0(\u30ea\u30df\u30c6\u30c3\u30c9\uff0f\u30bc\u30ed\u30aa\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc, Rimiteddo Zero \u014cb\u0101). This design is later on used for Senji Muramasa when he is summoned in Shirou's body.Abilities  Shirou is a magus trained by Kiritsugu Emiya. Differing from a formal magus, Shirou can instead be called a Spellcaster who does not follow the normal ways of magi. As he was adopted into the Emiya family, he has no way of inheriting Kiritsugu's Magic Crest, and he lacks the innate talent produced through generations of magi striving to develop the best Magic Circuits. His training was informal, as Kiritsugu had no desire to teach him originally, and aside from sparse knowledge, Kiritsugu taught him nothing of magecraft. He has an Origin of \"Sword\" and Elemental Affinity of \"Sword\" as well due to having had Avalon inside him for many years. This leaves him unable to use magic of the five great elements with precision due to lacking any as an alignment, but it does allow for the manifestation of Unlimited Blade Works and the derivative skills in Reinforcement and Projection Magecraft. Despite any more training, even when following Rin to the Mage's Association, he will never leave the level of a magus apprentice. Should Rin be given a ranking ranging from seventy to one hundred as a magus, Shirou would only rank as a ten. Ranked within the classification as a specialist spellcaster, he would be received as someone on par with Kiritsugu\u2019s evaluation as a \"Magus Killer\" with a rank of forty.Magecraft  He is an unorthodox magus who makes use of a very specialized version of Projection magecraft. Shirou is initially completely inept as a magus, only able to use Reinforcement and Projection Magecraft with a low level of success. Reinforcement allows him to analyze the structural composition of an object, and increase its effectiveness, such as making it more durable or its shape more practical, or return it to its original state. He can also use it to improve upon the physical capabilities of his own body, such as his eyesight, allowing him to see as far as four kilometers away. Shirou is also very skilled in Structural Grasp Magecraft, which allows him to understand the structure and design of objects as if he were viewing a blueprint. Projection, while a high level skill, is generally considered useless compared to Reinforcement due to the higher magical energy cost, and anything that Shirou initially projects is useless and hollow. Though the objects merely imitate the shape, there are only a few who can identify them as fakes in a first glance. Any practitioner that analyzes composition wouldn't be able to see through them, and even one that works through spiritual mediums would only notice a sense of incongruence. Since only objects with history ever go into the Department of Spiritual Invocation of Clock Tower, there is a low probability of them being discovered. Shirou's structural analysis is not a type of Mystic Eyes. Shirou is later capable of using Tracing, a higher level version of Projection that completely copies everything regarding the creation and existence of the object. During the Fate scenario, he slowly learns of it on his own by training with Rin and following Archer's advice: \"If you can't defeat it, then imagine what can\", while in the Unlimited Blade Works scenario, he learns of it through extensive contact with Archer. He is only effectively able to reproduce swords, other weapons, and armor, but this specialty allows him to faithfully reproduce even legendary weapons. However these weapons always suffer some degradation, as Humans cannot conceptualize an object's existence with a\u00a0single sense.\u00a0He is capable of reproducing any sword that he has seen, though Noble Phantasms are always one rank below their original strength and armor costs three times the amount of magical energy, and he is capable of employing its entire history, allowing him to wield any weapon with the same proficiency of its original owner. He has to see the weapons as how their form as final product actually are with his own eyes to reproduce them, as even the blueprint of Zelretch is not enough to reproduce it, but by seeing it and Caliburn through shared memories of Justeaze Lizrich von Einzbern and Saber, he becomes able to fully trace them afterward. If the weapon is not made of materials that exist in the world, such as Ea, he cannot analyze or reproduce it, though he can tell its basic nature. He is also quite capable of creating his own original kinds of weapons, should he put his mind to it. It is later identified that these abilities and Shirou's affinity with swords are concepts of Shirou's Reality Marble, Unlimited Blade Works. Rather than simply creating his projections in the real world, he actually reproduces them within the Reality Marble, as if he were loading a gun, and then projects them into the real world as if he were firing it. This allows him to prepare dozens of swords at a time for later use. Shirou is unable to properly deploy or maintain Unlimited Blade Works due to a shortage of magical energy, but with a proper contract with a magus with a suitable level of magical energy, such as Rin, he is capable of using it. If he were to learn about it normally, unlike the situation in Unlimited Blade Works where he learns of it firsthand from Archer, it would take ten years of training to set the foundations for the ability and another ten years to reach to the point of being able to use it. While actually using Unlimited Blade Works, the cost for creating the weapons is greatly diminished and the speed at which they can be created is also increased, allowing him to easily overwhelm Gilgamesh and his Gate of Babylon. If Shirou were to fight Shiki Tohno, there would be a high probability of a mutual defeat where Shirou would have his projected Noble Phantasms one-sidedly killed, while Shiki would overuse his Mystic Eyes of Death Perception to the point were he would overload and self-destruct after the battle. Circumstances would change if Shirou were capable of an Excalibur-like magical energy discharge. During a fight with Bazett Fraga McRemitz, a professional that specializes in anti-magus combat, he would likely be overwhelmed by her techniques, experience, and tactics, and he would also constantly have the disadvantage that using any of his high level techniques would leave him susceptible to Fragarach's instant kill ability.Knowledge  Shirou's basic training in Magecraft was extremely lacking, so he was left with the idea that he needs to create a new Magic Circuit with each use of Magecraft. He goes through extremely dangerous training, which he describes as the feeling of inserting a hot iron rod into his spine, where he constantly faces the risk of death in order to develop a new Circuit. Though his body has twenty-seven natural Magic Circuits, they had been abandoned for his nerves, which he made into makeshift Magic Circuits due to his wrong method of training. Once his real Circuits are awakened, he goes through extreme pain and suffering as his nervous system gets used to the new intake of energy. His newly opened Magic Circuits can barely handle ten units of magical energy each. Shirou has Avalon implanted within his body, which saved his life during the great fire. This gives him an extremely potent regenerative ability while Saber is summoned due to Excalibur, though it does seem to sustain him even without it as he was able to temporarily survive a fatal blow dealt by Lancer. This allows him to survive numerous fatal wounds though it works against him in bad endings where he is able to be tortured and mutilated without succumbing to his injuries for a long duration of time. Unlimited Blade Works also seems to protect Shirou by creating blades within his body to reinforce it. He is able to survive a blow to the chest from Rider's dagger, which is repelled as if it is hitting metal, a kick that would have gouged his stomach only knocks him away, and he manages to keep from having his entire body destroyed from an attack by Gilgamesh. The ability seems to go out of control during a bad ending where numerous swords sprout from his dying body, and while his body is fully breaking down in the Heaven's Feel scenario, they are constantly being created and protruding from his skin. He practices basic sword fighting with Saber, though it amounts to little in actual offensive capabilities. While she teaches him, he cannot use her fighting style as a model. He cannot see exactly how she is attacking and their different physiques makes her impossible to copy.Fate  During Fate, Shirou only learns the basics of his abilities, leading him to only trace Caliburn and Avalon. He temporarily utilizes a bow during the second battle with Berserker, having imitated Archer's Bow. Shirou\u2019s Bow\u00a0(\u58eb\u90ce\u306e\u5f13, Shir\u014d no Yumi) is formed by utilizing strengthening magecraft on a tree branch he had found, and he creates arrows for it in the same manner. It utilizes the same design for the most part, but the arrow rest and grip are amateurish and simple compared to those of Archer's bow. Shirou personally thinks it is ugly and crooked, but it functions properly as a bow. It is also slightly less curved due to Shirou's preference in the Japanese method of shooting. He is only a practitioner of Japanese archery compared to Archer's Western method, so he subconsciously altered the bow into his preferred shape without realizing it.Unlimited Blade Works Contradiction  Shirou and Archer's connection is a large part of his development in the Unlimited Blade Works scenario. The contradiction of Shirou Emiya and the Heroic Spirit EMIYA existing at once is much like magecraft that allows one to acquire skills from the past by possessing themselves with a previous self. The more they come into contact, the more of his knowledge and techniques flow into him. The abilities suit him perfectly, as they are Shirou Emiya's optimal technique, perfected over many years of training. It is first noticed after several training sessions with Saber, when he makes a drastic improvement over the previous day. Copying Archer's technique, he begins to make fewer unnecessary movements, allowing him to desperately avoid her counter-attacks rather than become instantly knocked out, and as his body is already fit, just the knowledge of proper techniques can improve his fighting quickly. He is captivated by Kanshou and Bakuya, and uses it as a basis for a two-sword fighting style. He does not have a basic style, so it is immediately evident that he is copying Archer. The flow of it is so unconscious that he believes that Saber is going easier on him, and his sword is able to automatically parry her strikes even though his body cannot react to them. The effect greatly magnifies after they recognize each other's identities, causing extreme pain as it flows into him. His body begins to break every time they touch, as he has learned too much of his future self while trying to match him in skill. He even begins to obtain Archer's memories, such as the reason behind his hatred for their shared ideals.Projection  Once he learns the true use of Projection, he lacks proper training so even the most basic projections cause him pain and the majority of the swords generated shatter upon impact due to their low quality. He projects both Archer's sword technique and his reproduction ability, but it is flawed because he does not understand that they originate from his Reality Marble. Unlimited Blade Works cannot be utilized without that realization, and even after coming to that conclusion, he does not have the necessary energy to utilize it on his own. He forms a contract with Rin to have her provide the necessary magical energy to form his Reality Marble and he manages to project a number of weapons from the Gate of Babylon while fighting Gilgamesh.Heaven's Feel Archer's arm  Shirou does not develop his abilities as he does in the other routes during Heaven's Feel. He uses his basic Reinforcement magecraft on a stick and wooden sword during the early part of the war without grasping onto Projection. During the first conflict in the Einzbern Forest, he loses his arm while protecting Ilya from the Shadow's explosion. The wound is critical, so Archer, having also suffered a critical wound, tells them to transplant his left arm onto Shirou. Attaching a spiritual body to a normal human body requires a spiritual doctor like Kotomine because the process it more akin to healing the soul rather than the body. Kotomine manages to attach Archer's arm\u00a0(\u30a2\u30fc\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u306e\u8155, \u0100ch\u0101 no Ude) to replace Shirou's lost arm. It is a \"foreign substance\" that should not be there, attached by opposing the natural Providence, and joining two separate spiritual bodies is forbidden magic that cannot normally succeed. The formation of spiritual bodies deals with resurrection and restoration of souls, divine mysteries that cannot be handled with magecraft, so it would normally be that the recipient would die of shock even if the operation was a success in shape. Kotomine expected the completion of the surgery to result in his death, but Archer and Shirou being the same person makes them an exception to the normal rejection. Not knowing of their exact connection, he states that they are suited for each other and not even two twins would be as similar. While the arm would have disappeared had Archer faded away while the surgery was in progress, it is now anchored to Shirou and can be called his own limb. Due to being transplanted while Archer was still in the world, it is part of a Heroic Spirit that has been connected to his Magic Circuits, and stays in the world using his own magical energy. While unconscious, the arm grants him knowledge on Archer, the basis of Projection magecraft, battle experience, and battle information. The sensation feels like his body is burning while countless ants enter the hole in his shoulder that is now sealed with flesh that is not his own. While the sensation tells him to manage these skills, the level of information and power required feel impossible to him. Even if it becomes familiar with his body, he neither has the skills to handle it or the power to use it without destroying his body. While they are the same person with compatible Magic Circuits, the power of the arm of a Heroic Spirit is not something a human can handle. No matter how suited he is to the arm, he cannot use its abilities without it eventually swallowing him due to his body being spiritually far inferior to the arm. It can be considered a weapon more than an arm, and it is referred to as an Artificial Phantasm: Man-made illusions\u00a0(, ) in the scene's title. It passively flows Archer's battle experience and physical abilities into Shirou even while inactive. It acts like an overdose of strength-enhancing drugs, letting him demonstrate abilities beyond his limits. He becomes able to easily leap out of the third story window of the Einzbern Castle, compared to around eight stories for a normal building, with only temporary numbness and pain upon landing. Unable to strengthen his body, he does bring a large amount of magical energy to his feet to lessen the impact and believes that landing on asphalt instead of grass would have broken his legs. Ilya mentions that Archer is influencing both his mind and body, making him think that he can easily handle the drop like Archer and toughening his body enough to survive. He can also run fifty kilometers per hour through the uneven terrain of the Einzbern Forest.Shroud of Martin  In order to counteract the effects of the arm, Shirou is given a Holy Shroud, the Shroud of Martin\u00a0(\u30de\u30eb\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30f3\u306e\u8056\u9ab8\u5e03, Marutin no Seigaifu), by Kotomine, as a seal which keeps Archer's circuits from connecting to his body because it has the ability to seal a certain event or return it to normal. It completely wraps around his arm with the exception of his fingers, and while it is initially completely numb, it eventually regains enough functionality after familiarizing with his body to allow him to lead an ordinary life. It would be possible to cut it off, but that would remove his only possible weapon in defeating Zouken. The arm is treated as a different object even if he uses magecraft, but magical energy still constantly flows through the body even if magecraft is not being used. Despite the Shroud cutting off the Magic Circuits, he will feel a great deal of pain if he does not concentrate to form a \"barrier\" to keep the \"foreign substance\" out of his unstable body when the arm reacts to the energy and tries to activate. It is easy to do once he figures out where the pain is coming from, and he is able to control it to an extent. Living with it is not quite as easy as Kotomine suggests because the arm randomly flows magical energy into his body. It constantly becomes hotter each time he moves it, and when it overheats, it sends the excess to the rest of his body. While it first feels like he is being burned, he realizes it is more like he is being cut and stabbed by his own body. Simply undoing part of the binding for even a brief moment causes him to completely lose himself as his nerves and senses are overwhelmed by extreme pain and the feeling of impending death. He rambles on in his mind about how he is feeling more pain than ever before, \"sitting on a mountain of swords\", and that he can see all of his cells crumbling apart. He regains his senses a few seconds afterward, and he cannot remember the exact happenings during that period. He is able to manage at times, but also suffers a great deal of pain in intervals to the point of wishing to simply cut it off, or even risk removing the shroud to stop the pain. Its existence brings him true fear of an unavoidable death and utter obliteration, making it the first he has felt such since the fire ten years before. His ability to suppress the infringement from the arm even with the Shroud is limited to a certain extent. Kotomine believes that the arm will consume him within ten years, but it is possible for him to live to an old age if he trains to become a magus worthy of matching the arm in order to seal it without the Shroud. It is not an imminent threat, so he would have enough time to attempt do so if he wished. Rin also shares part of her Magic Crest with him as a Warding Sign. She is able to transplant a small part of her Crest by placing her left hand on his body, comprehending it, and sharing her warding crest. While she was planning on giving him the capability to use a \"switch\" for his Magic Circuit, being able to turn it on and off is too dangerous in his current state. She instead performs it to suppress the magical energy by placing needles in his left shoulder, belly button, and throat so that the arm won't be connected to him unless he wishes for it. It also grants a resistance to magical energy, so that something that passively absorbs energy like the Shadow will have less of an effect on him. Her crest cannot familiarize itself with someone not from the Tohsaka family, so it is a makeshift that won't even last a week.Projection  Shirou is currently observing Archer's magecraft rather than his own magecraft, so he cannot use Projection in his current state without invoking the abilities of the arm. Ilya states that he will eventually obtain his own usage of Projection magecraft, but it is still only a possibility at his current level. His own Projection is still at the level where it will fail constantly due to his misunderstandings, but drawing on Archer's knowledge without invoking the arm can force him to \"level up\" quickly. He can loosen the Shroud slightly in order to practice retrieving Archer's knowledge without breaking the seal and only getting a small reaction. With help from Rin's Magic Crest to increase his Magic Resistance and Ilya to protect his consciousness, he is able to experience Archer's Projection by interacting with the arm like opening a Magic Circuit. The knowledge is like poison, but the arm will continuously flow its experience into him. It is similar to pouring one hundred units of fuel into a container that can only hold ten, and he will likely only gain from less than a tenth of the agony he will endure. The knowledge disrupts his memories and leaves him with a large blank space after replacing the Shroud. Projecting directly with Archer's abilities requires the removal of the Shroud, and while he may be able to recall the activation spell gained from Archer's knowledge, it would destroy his body to attempt using it. It can easily be removed at any time for instant access to the full extent of Archer's power. It is not something that lessens his life with each use, but the activation of a time bomb that will ultimately lead to his death the second he removes the Shroud. Archer's Magic Circuits will be activated if he uses the arm even once, and while he may last while using its abilities, his body will break down due to being unable to withstand Archer's magic. He will eventually be consumed, or more correctly \"blown away\", by the arm after the first activation. Once it is removed, Shirou instantly gains access to Archer's Magic Circuits, battle experience, and techniques, but he cannot deploy Unlimited Blade Works because Archer's inner world is different from his. He claims that he can only reproduce what he himself has learned and the Noble Phantasms that he has personally recorded, but he is later shown to be able to project Caladbolg II and Rho Aias from Archer's records despite never having personally witnessed them before. The level of Projection magecraft and combat experience and abilities granted is sufficient to allow Shirou to match Servants in direct combat for a limited time and even defeat them. He is able to trace \"Nine Lives\" to kill Black Berserker nine times with a single maneuver called \"Nine Lives Blade Works\" and later defeat Saber Alter with the Overedge technique of Kanshou and Bakuya at the cost of his mind during a bad ending. Using these abilities comes with a heavy penalty as Archer's circuits overload Shirou's body leading to his mind slowly eroding, the decay of his memories, and eventual death as his body and soul break down from being invaded by Archer's Unlimited Blade Works.Puppet body  Due to Archer's arm and his overuse of Projection, his Magic Circuit is broken into pieces, and his death is one that even the Holy Grail could not reverse. He is resurrected by Ilya's imperfect usage of the Third Magic, reviving his soul and giving him a body free of wounds by preserving his soul and inserting it into a container. It would normally be that giving the soul a container or body would allow it to take perfect form by utilizing the \"genes of the soul\" rather than those of the body. His body is reconstructed from a portion of Ilya's body, which she mentions is a bit cheap as a container, so it is nowhere near his original form in terms of size. Its shape afterward is not that of a human, but as he mentions reaching his hands out and grasping onto Rin's pendant, it is at least vaguely humanoid. He is able to be found due to Rider using the pendant as a landmark to locate him, and while his exact form is left unknown, it is small enough to be \"plucked\" from the river by Rider. He is not a true product of the Third Magic, a high-dimensional planar being, but it instead re-anchored his soul to a vessel. They decide to experiment with various ideas for a proper body during the first six months, as he cannot simply grow in his current state. They do not have the resources to make a homunculus body, so they instead sell the books of the Matou household to obtain a puppet body left by Touko Aozaki. He is perfectly human even in this state, but Rin notes his soul is actually remotely controlling the body. He can receive surgery at hospitals, drink cold medicines, be killed, and eventually grow old and die of old age. The soul is fixed to the body, so he can be likened to a Servant that can operate without a Master. He has some issues because body is used, but even other good puppet makers cannot match up to it. Rin wishes to find and consult Touko about it, but her Sealing Designation makes that a hard prospect. The magical energy does not flow well, but Shirou is fine with it because all other aspects are better than his original body. The soul will overwrite the body no matter its quality, so there will likely always be places that won't function properly. Sakura supplements his very weak Magic Circuit with her own overflowing amount in order to keep him from returning to his prior state. Despite the setbacks, Rin believes that he should be able to utilize Unlimited Blade Works with training, and that his being a successful example of the Third Magic is an extraordinary trait in itself.Development Creation and Conception  Kinoko Nasu's original story of Fate, Saber and Shirou were opposite gender to now. Ayaka Sajyou was the original main protagonist until Takashi Takeuchi convinced to Nasu to change the setting but the essential theme had not been changed, it's the story about legendary heroes and \"a boy meets a girl.\" Nasu describes his writing of Shirou is based on novels written after the 90s, where the main character suffers from trying to come to terms with his problems in their own narrow perspectives.Reception  Gen Urobuchi believes Saber's relationship with Shirou doesn't seem like a realistic relationship between a male and a female, but a complicated relationship with a boy who became a girl. He further explains that it is not a relationship fueled by instinct like the relationship between a man and a woman, but a romance of logic between two people who need each other from the heart. He thinks the Fate route could have been told as a story through the ancient Greek views on love. Urobuchi, thinks the true heroine of Fate/stay night is Rin Tohsaka. He asserted that Shirou's relationship with Rin was the more realistic relationship. In the \"Unlimited Blade Works\" route, an equal relationship with a woman who's become stronger than men is depicted. Rin and Shirou mend each other's weaknesses with their own unique strength. Also, Sakura's romance expresses the dark sides that women have, but Shirou's actions show that men can accept that and love them regardless.References English  Nasu:With this time's battle, since we're working off the assumption that Shirou \"has trained/is operating himself to the max\", people might think that this might end up being a good fight, but m'lady Bazett's a trained professional specializing in anti-magus battles. Technique, experience, and battle power. Against someone like her whose superior in all those regards, even with a \"Broken Phantasm\", Shirou's disadvantages are still not going to change. And you see. She's ruthless.English  User: Emiya Shirou\nA bow that Emiya Shirou made during the fight against Berserker. He attempted to create a copy of Archer\u2019s bow, by using strengthening magecraft on a tree branch. Though the design is more or less the same, if you compare it to Archer\u2019s bow the arrow rest and grip are amateurish and simple. Furthermore, it is a bit less curved, more akin to a Japanese bow than a Western one. It seems that Shirou, as a practitioner of Japanese archery accustomed to the Japanese method of shooting, altered the bow into this shape without realizing it.Japanese  \u58eb\u90ce\u306e\u5f13\n\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\uff1a\u885b\u5bae\u58eb\u90ce\n\u30d0\u30fc\u30b5\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u6226\u306b\u304a\u3044\u3066\u3001\u58eb\u90ce\u304c\u6728\u306e\u679d\u3092\u5f37\u5316\u3057\u3001\u30a2\u30fc\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u306e\u5f13\u3092\u307e\u306d\u3066\u4f5c\u308a\u4e0a\u3052\u305f\u5f13\u3002\u5927\u307e\u304b\u306a\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306f \u4f3c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u304c\u3001\u30a2\u30fc\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u306e\u5f13\u306b\u6bd4\u3079\u308b\u3068\u3001\u77e2\u647a\u3001\u5f13\u675f\u306e\u90e8\u5206\u304c\u5358\u7d14\u306a\u5f62\u306b\u306a\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\u307e\u305f\u3001\u3057\u306a\u308a\u3082\u5c11\u3057\u5c0f\u3055 \u304f\u3001\u6d0b\u5f13\u3068\u3044\u3046\u3088\u308a\u306f\u548c\u5f13\u306b\u8fd1\u3044\u3002\u5f13\u9053\u3092\u3057\u3066\u3044\u305f\u58eb\u90ce\u306f\u3001\u624b\u306e\u3072\u3089\u5074\u306b\u77e2\u3092\u3064\u304c\u3048\u308b\u548c\u5f13\u306e\u5c04\u6cd5\u306b\u6163\u308c\u3066\u3044\u305f \u305f\u3081\u3001\u7121\u610f\u8b58\u306b\u3053\u306e\u5f62\u306b\u306a\u3063\u305f\u3068\u601d\u308f\u308c\u308b\u3002Archer (Fate/stay night)  Archer\u00a0(\u30a2\u30fc\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc, \u0100ch\u0101) is the Archer-class Servant of Rin Tohsaka in the Fifth Holy Grail War of Fate/stay night. He is one of the Servants of Ritsuka Fujimaru of the Grand Orders conflicts of Fate/Grand Order.Profile Identity  Archer's True Name is EMIYA\u00a0(\u30a8\u30df\u30e4), Shirou Emiya. He is not a proper Heroic Spirit in the sense of other heroes. He is an alternate version of Shirou from an alternate timeline of Fate/stay night where he made a contract with the World (Alaya) and became the Heroic Spirit EMIYA. He acts as a Counter Guardian for the world as payment for the contract. He is summoned because he still has the jewel pendant that Rin used to save his life after Lancer stabbed his heart. The jewel he owns is the actual catalyst used for his summoning rather than the one that Rin still has at the time of his summoning. After the end of each of the three routes in Fate/stay night, the possibility for Shirou to become Archer still exists, but the chance of it happening is close to zero. The beginning conditions for Archer's Holy Grail War were mostly the same as that of the Fate/stay night universe, but it could be said that \"something was missing.\" The following events of the war happened in a similar manner to the Fate scenario, having summoned Saber and continued fighting together with her until the end, but while he understood her, he didn't \"save Saber's heart.\" After they destroyed the Grail and parted, he went on to cooperate with Rin and headed to London. He eventually went on to work as a freelance magus to pursue his dream of becoming a hero of Justice. He stubbornly trained himself while pursuing his dream of saving mankind, but later fell into despair upon realizing that his abilities were insufficient in fulfilling his goal. Sometime in his twenties, he obtained his signature red overcoat, possibly as a gift from Ciel of the Church. He at some point encountered and fought beings similar to Angra Mainyu, but he was forced to retreat when he was unable to act against them. He later gained some understanding of such beings as targets of the Counter Force upon entering the Throne of Heroes. He had to make a life changing decision. Confronted by a calamity which had the potential of killing one hundred people before him, he decided to \"make a contract\" with the World to become a hero capable of producing miracles and become a Heroic Spirit after his death. He believed he could save both the lives of the dying people before him and save even more as a hero after his death. Although he desperately fought to end a war, he was in turn branded as the mastermind behind that war and subsequently executed because of the betrayal of his allies. Although he died of betrayal, he did not hate mankind. However, the \"World\" ironically gave him the duty as a Heroic Spirit \"to slaughter all humans at a particular location when mankind is at the threshold of complete self destruction\", a \"Counter Guardian\". His belief that he would continue to save many people as a Heroic Spirit did happen, but it was through being made to clean up after human actions and forced to take many lives to save humanity as a whole, instead of \"saving everyone\" - protecting humans without having to cause deaths of humans as he would have liked to. After seeing human self-destruction and forced to oppose his own ideals countless times, he began to deny himself and his ideal. Even knowing that the Throne of Heroes was isolated from time and space, Archer desperately came to believe that his only hope of release was to have himself summoned into an era where Shirou Emiya exists and kill his past self, hoping that the double paradox created by Shirou Emiya being killed before having a chance to make the contract with Alaya and that the killing was done by a Shirou Emiya who successfully made the contract with the world would create a time paradox great enough in magnitude that could potentially erase his existence as a Counter Guardian.Appearance  Archer appears as a man in his early thirties with a muscular build. Shirou from the Fifth Grail War would grow about 20cm as Archer. It is uncertain if his extreme height growth is caused by magecraft. Comparing to Shirou, Archer has white hair, gray eyes and tanned skin colour. His skin, hair and eye colors are different to his younger self due to the extensive use of projection magecraft that caused a rebound effect. His servant clothing, Red Plain Mystic Code\u00a0(\u8d64\u539f\u793c\u88c5, Akahara Reis\u014d) is Archer's signature costume. He wears a black body armor made from a special material that has yet to be discovered by mankind as of the present time, which consisted of a black tight and sleeveless shirt with sliver accents which outlined his muscles and a metal plate on his collar, and black pants that had two black straps on his thighs, and another two strapped around his shins separate from each other. He wears black metal plated shoes, which appear to be attached to his trousers. His signature red coat is a type of holy shroud, which were actually two separate sleeves connected by a metal plate at the back which covered his arms and was cut off showing his upper torso and midriff, and had a separate red open skirt which ended above his shins with the top fashioned and tied with an agemaki knot, covered by a silver metal plate. In Fate/hollow ataraxia, Archer is seen without his holy shroud in one of the loops - however, he is wearing black bow gloves. In his past, Archer has been seen wearing a pale-coloured cloak in the Ufotable adaptation of Unlimited Blade Works. In Fate/hollow ataraxia, his casual attire consisted of a plain black shirt and black trousers. When he went fishing, he wore his signature clothing without the holy shroud. Instead, he wore a red down vest jacket and a red cap hat.Personality  His personality is very contradicting. While he is thoroughly cynical and nihilistic, he is at the same time devoted and protective, and even a little childish to the point that it makes him hard to hate. He does not lie, but he does keep secrets and tell half truths. He means well and is capable of being nice, but often ends up being sarcastic, especially so when he gives advice. He cannot approve of Shirou\u2019s ideal of becoming a Hero of Justice due to his own experience, but at the same time he cannot deny it\u00a0for\u00a0the very same reasons. Archer is a very bitter person due to how his life turned out after constant betrayal by those he deemed his comrades in life and for becoming\u00a0a counter guardian willingly, a being that is forced to \"clean up the messes humanity has made\". The reason he chose to become a counter guardian was because he believed that he could save as many people as possible and in a way this was true, but the reality was that the counter force merely sent him to a point in time where it believed humanity was on the brink of collapse and had him kill any and every person it had deemed to be the perpetrators irrespective of the fact if they were good or evil. Archer was forced to kill in spite of his beliefs and feelings, something that shattered him from within and essentially broke his heart. Due to this Archer feels\u00a0betrayed by his ideal, his sole remaining wish even in his afterlife. That further solidified his bitterness and increased its intensity. His bitterness was so strong that he wished to die. He claims that his memory is confused to the incomplete nature of his summoning, but that is only half truthful. He is able to assess the situation and deduce his circumstances the night of his summoning, believing himself to have the opportunity to achieve his goal to kill Shirou. He had forgotten the name \"Rin Tohsaka\" over the period of his life, but remembers her the instant she introduces herself. Murmuring \"\u2015\u2015Rin. Ah, that's the name\u2015\u2015\" under his breath, it is a statement from his heart filled with \"much endearment close to insanity.\" He claims to no longer have Shirou's memory, but remembers the day Kiritsugu Emiya saved him and the feelings he felt upon seeing Kiritsugu's smile. He has a fond remembrance of the moment Saber was first summoned that he will always recall vividly \"even if he should fall into the depths of hell.\" He's not interested in video games but he is willing to play, once he gets started. Archer gains much joy and pride in housework especially cooking. Though he denies that he enjoys doing them.Role Fate/stay night  In the prologue of Fate/stay Night, Rin intended to summon a strong Saber class servant without a catalyst. Unknowing to her, the jewel pendant was used as a catalyst which summoned the Heroic Spirit EMIYA. Rin's Pendant, a one-of-a-kind jewel kept by Emiya as a keepsake of his unknown savior over the years. Differing from normal, it is not the pendant Rin owns in the present that acts as the catalyst. Emiya is instead a case where he holds a catalyst with a connection to his summoner. Archer crash landed in one of the mansion room after the summoning process has been completed. He is disappointed by her first impression of him, to which she questions what he is \"supposed\" to be. After the two of them confirm their relationship as Master and Servant, Archer begins to question Rin as a master. He judges her worth as a master, and even goes so far as to announce he will not follow her orders, regardless of their importance. Archer makes sarcastic remarks about Rin which aggravated her to use one of her command seals to force Archer submit to her. Afterwards, Archer scolds her for being so careless, and asks whether or not she knows the importance of Command Seals. Once their argument is settled, Archer agrees to stay with Rin. He blames Rin for his vague memories due to her incomplete summoning but also acknowledges her talents and skills. Archer is then seen touring the Fuyuki City, with Rin acting as his guide. As they venture through the city, Archer learns that Rin has no actual wish for the Holy Grail, other than her desire to win it. One night, after informing Archer of a strange Bounded field around the school grounds, Rin goes to the school in an attempt to destroy it, only to encounter another servant, who she identifies as belonging to the Lancer-class. When Lancer tries to attack Rin, Archer intervenes. The two servants then engage in a fight. While Lancer tries to disarm Archer, he becomes quite agitated at Archer's ability to reequip his swords. During in their fight, Shirou Emiya was a pedestrian who witnessed the two Heroic Spirits battle for the first time. Before their fight can continue, they are disrupted by Shirou's presence. Lancer stops the fight and pursues Shirou, Archer and Rin followed him. Lancer pursues the student, and impales them before fleeing. Archer and Rin stumble upon the student's body. When Rin and Archer found Shirou, Rin ordered Archer to track down Lancer, but he was unsuccessful. Rin identifies the student as a boy she encountered earlier, and uses her healing magic on him. Before the boy can regain consciousness, the pair flee. Archer gave his own pendant back to Rin making her think that Archer returned to the scene to retrieve the pendant. Shortly after, Archer and Rin come to the conclusion that Lancer's master will gain knowledge of the boy's survival, and have Lancer finish him off. Deciding to protect the boy, the pair travel to the suburbs. However, before they can enter the grounds, they are attacked by a servant, who Rin identifies as belonging to the Saber-class.Fate  In Fate, Archer is a nameless hero who gives up his life in order to let his master, Rin, escape along with Saber and Shirou. Before facing off with Berserker, Archer advises Shirou to 'imagine something that can defeat it' when presented with an enemy he cannot defeat. He is subsequently killed in combat against Berserker, but not before killing Berserker six times (five in the anime) and reducing his stock of lives from God Hand.Unlimited Blade Works  In Unlimited Blade Works, Archer is the servant protagonist like Saber in the Fate route and Rider in Heaven's Feel. Despite this\u00a0Archer\u00a0develops into\u00a0an antagonistic character later in the story. Archer early in the story shows to be both a powerful servant and a character shrouded in mystery. During the battle with Berserker and Illya, Archer shows his great skill when he protected Rin from Illya and attacking Berserker with his Caladbolg which he fired as an arrow to destructive effect.\u00a0Rin initially\u00a0thought it was an A rank noble phantasm. In reality it was an A rank broken phantasm. During the early part of the route Archer awakens Shirou's dormant magic circuits. Throughout his many battles in the route Archer demonstrates that he is on par with\u00a0Caster in devising strategies with them both\u00a0being regarded as\u00a0the best tactians in the holy grail war. Often winning with his well planned strategies that he often doesn't share with Rin beforehand. Archer throughout the route tries multiple times to kill Shirou Emiya or not assist in dangerous\u00a0situations Shirou is caught in, in hopes of it resulting in his death. Archer betrays Rin after she tells him that she wants to rescue Saber so that she can form a contract with Shirou and become his servant once again. He aligned with Caster because he claimed, she had the highest chance of acquiring the Holy Grail. After conceding to Lancer, he then betrays Caster and her master and kills them both, revealing his true intentions. Archer's identity as an older version of Shirou is revealed. Archer reveals he needed to be freed from his contract with\u00a0Rin\u00a0in order to accomplish his goal of killing Shirou. Archer then kidnaps Rin after she forms a contract with Saber, forcing a situation where Shirou must engage Archer. During the battle it's revealed that due to Shirou and Archer being the same person. The more he engages with Archer the more Shirou absorbs Archer's skill and abilities. Archer loses the battle, but only because he does not attack Shirou as he is stabbed through the chest. However, he survived the blow due to Independent Action, and remains hidden up until the final battle. Despite everyone believing him\u00a0to be dead.\u00a0He saves Rin from the Holy Grail and eliminates a cornered and nearly defeated Gilgamesh\u00a0who had lost to Shirou. Rin appears before him desiring to form a contract with him. He tells her he does not want to and he believes it would not be possible. He then disappears for good with a smile on his face, confident that Rin will stop Shirou from taking a path that he will regret.Heaven's Feel  In Heaven's Feel, Archer abandons his wish to kill Shirou, opting instead to fulfill his duties as a Counter Guardian to eliminate 'the shadow'. During a battle with Saber Alter, Assassin and \"the shadow\", Archer's core is critically damaged and he is mortally wounded. Since Shirou has discarded his heroic ideals to save Sakura, Archer chooses to have Kotomine graft his left arm onto Shirou, who lost his arm protecting Ilya (following the way of the Counter Guardians, sacrificing one life to save another rather than losing both). Much of Archer's knowledge was subsequently transferred to Shirou, though the foreign arm began to invade his body as well. Archer's final appearance in Heaven's Feel is a motivational image for Shirou, who is struggling with taking off the Shroud of Martin.Manga  The Fate/stay night manga follows parts of both Fate and Unlimited Blade Works. He remains loyal to Rin instead of joining Caster of his own free will, and he displays the same antagonistic attitude towards Shirou. He is forced to join Caster once Kuzuki captures and holds Rin hostage. After freeing himself from her control, he proceeds with his plan to kill Shirou. He is stopped by Rin, who begs him not to kill his younger self and erase his existence as a Heroic Spirit, as she has respect for both Shirou and Archer. Eventually, Archer decides not to kill Shirou and continues his role as Rin's Servant, reforming their contract. Finally, during the group's rescue of Shirou from Illya's mansion, Archer sacrifices himself to stall Berserker in battle and take away half his stock of lives - but not before entrusting Rin to Shirou, giving him a final few words of encouragement before walking to the hero's end he'd always previously disdained, smiling to the very end.Fate/hollow ataraxia  When Rin went to Mage's Association to attend a court, she asked Archer to protect Fuyuki City in her absence. In the loops, Archer guards the bridge that connects Miyama and Shinto districts of Fuyuki city. Should Shirou try to cross the bridge at night time without meeting certain conditions first, he will be sniped off by Archer from the roof of the center building in Shinto district. After Shirou/Avenger \"relearn\" his Projection magic, he and Saber challenge Archer. They fight from a long distance. Archer fired the Broken Phantasm Hrunting towards them while Saber flew towards Archer with Shirou's Command Spell. Saber defeated Archer while Shirou/Avenger deflected the Hrunting with Rho Aias. Defeating Archer grants Shirou/Avenger the access of Shinto at night patrols. After that, he began to shows up in Fuyuki to be interacted with. At the night of the final loop, Rin and Archer guard the Fuyuki Bridge from a horde of \"monsters\" to prevent them from chasing after Shirou/Avenger.Fate/Unlimited Codes  In Fate/Unlimited Codes, he is known as the Wrought Iron Hero\u00a0(\u932c\u9244\u306e\u82f1\u96c4, Rentetsu no Eiy\u016b). In his arcade story, he monologues his situation about him being summoned in the Fuyuki Holy Grail War and how it was a miracle for him to achieve his goal to alter his past by ending Shirou and allowing Rin to win the Holy Grail War. He has to deceive his Master in order to do this. Archer unexpectedly faces Shirou early and by the time he faces Shirou, Shirou figured out his identity and challenged Archer. Archer expected Saber to fight him personally, however Shirou decided to settle things between the two as the Hero of Justice. As the fight turns into a clash of their ideals, Archer responds to Shirou that an ideal amounts to nothing if there is no strength to back them up and is forced to cut him down. Although he wins, it is hinted that Archer didn't kill Shirou and continued the Holy Grail War against the other participates. His last opponent is Gilgamesh, who asked if Archer requested assistance for death. However, Archer claims that he is doing something stupid by eliminating the villain who will burn the whole city. His original goal was to let Rin win, but he can't allow Gilgamesh to continue and Archer prevails in their fight. In his ending, many years has past and Archer is fighting along with an adult Rin against an army of Golems. Archer turns out more cheerful and Rin finds him cooler than in their first encounter. In Rin's ending, Rin sealed the Holy Grail and transformed Archer into a smaller scale of himself. She claims that she transformed Archer into this form because he didn't help her out in the war. Archer regrets that he didn't destroy the Holy Grail.Fate/Extra CCC  There exists an alternate version of Archer in Fate/EXTRA universe. Although their life experiences were the same, this version made a contract with the Moon Cell rather than the World. This resulted in him becoming a nameless Heroic Spirit embodying the concept of a \"hero of justice\" rather than the Counter Guardian EMIYA. Through fluctuations in the Moon Cell, Fate/stay night version of Rin and Archer appear in Fate/Extra CCC. Should the two versions face each other, the Fate/stay night Archer is noted to be more cynical.Fate/Grand Order First Order  In First Order Archer was one of the Servants summoned into the Holy Grail War being fought in Fuyuki, but after battling Saber Alter, he was blackened along with the other Servants. After being blackened, he acts as Saber Alter's guardian, patrolling the burning ruins of Fuyuki and attacking anyone he deems a threat with his bow. During this time, he seems to have had several encounters with Caster, where they fought at long-range with neither being able to get the upper hand. When Caster teams up with the Chaldea team, he faces Archer on Mt. Miyama, finally ending their battle at the Miyama Temple with Caster being the victor.GUDAGUDA Honnouji  EMIYA appears in the singularity under the name Chousokabe Emichika. After hearing Shimuza Setanta's complaint about having to be grouped with him and Mouri Medinari, Chousokabe states that he wished could've refused to obey as a Servant this time around. Chousokabe then asks Mouri if she knows what is happening after she complains that the Holy Grail is being used for something weird again. Then, after Mouri complains again about being named after a strategist from Warring States period that she knows nothing about, he notes that the Grail has made strange pairings for pairing a grand strategist and the Witch of Betrayal. Chousakabe then agrees Mouri's plan for him to ambush Ritsuka, Mash, Okita, and Nobunaga when Shimuza lures them. Before the group though, he tells Shimuza to careful about the mini-nobu, which wonders if it's male. Later, Shimuza succeeds in luring the group to the ambush spot, which Chousakabe assaults his arrows. After the ambush is successful, he asks Mouri what she plans to do with the group. However, when he says his given name along with his allies, Okita becomes enraged and dons the Coat of Oaths, which he blames on him being Chousakabe. After being he and the others are defeated by her, Chousakabe states that this incident was stranger than expected.Miss Almost Weekly Santa Alter  EMIYA goes on a fishing trip with Robin Hood as a continuation of their competition since both were equally matched at hunting in the woods. Unfortunately their contest was interrupted when David, having stowed away earlier without their prior knowledge, had steered their ship out to sea due to him wanting to meet the ladies of Southern Lands. David's decision however leads them into a storm, and both EMIYA and Robin blame him for their situation as the ship is torn apart by the storm. They then get further infuriated with David when he tells them jump overboard and swim for shore, believing that the ship's weight can withhold his weight alone. EMIYA then agrees with Robin's decision to throw David overboard when he begins to recount the tale of Carneades. Santa Alter then suddenly lands on the ship; EMIYA remains silent when Robin asks him if he knows her when she mentions him regarding that a Servant should think of their Master's safety. However, he and the others fight Santa Alter when she decides to test David's claim of being the \"Most Victorious King\". After being defeated by her, EMIYA asks if everyone has calmed down now and why Santa Alter had come, which she answers that she came in response to a Dear Santa letter. This prompts EMIYA to accuse David of wanting jewels for his many wives, and chastise him for writing letters to Santa as an adult. But David asserts that it wasn't him as he sends his prayers only to God and finds the concept of Santa to be scary, which makes EMIYA realizes that Robin had sent the letter. He then refutes Santa Alter's claim that he's too overprotective unlike Robin's more subtle method of protecting his Master. After Santa Alter leaves after giving presents to Robin and David, EMIYA notices that the storm had passed, and is glad that he won't have to hear the tale of Carneades. He and Robin then both yell that David hasn't learned anything since Uriah incident when he asked who was talking about Carneades. EMIYA then again agrees with Robin's decision to throw David overboard, but he contemplates David's request for them to form a team. However, they're interrupted by the arrival of Elizabeth B\u00e1thory, who had came to perform a concert for them as Santa Alter's last gift to them.Interlude  In his first interlude Requirements of a Master\u00a0(\u30de\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u6761\u4ef6), EMIYA, Ritsuka, and Mash go to Fuyuki, which he suspects turned into its present due to the Masters there letting their Servant run wild without the interference of the Mage's Association and the Holy Church. After telling Ritsuka to control their Servants with their Command Spells, he goes to explain the different attributes of the Heroic Spirits. However, his lesson is interrupted by the appearance of monsters, which the group are soon able to defeat. Afterwards, EMIYA goes on to explain the differences between different Servant classes, but he interrupted once again by monsters. After killing the monsters, he tells Ritsuka that Masters and Servants should work together on equal terms. However, a group of Amazons appear targeting EMIYA, but they are soon defeated by him and the others. EMIYA then says that they should return to Chaldea, realizing that Ritsuka didn't need his lectures since they already have wonderful Servant with them like Mash. He tells Ritsuka that they have a long journey ahead of them, and that they'll learn better through experience, not words. He continues to tell Ritsuka to go at their own pace, but he soon asked by Mash why he's being nice to both of them. EMIYA answers that he wants others known that his Masters succeed, saying that a true Servant increase their reputation by helping their Master grow. In his second interlude Unlimited Blade Works\u00a0(\u7121\u9650\u306e\u5263\u88fd), EMIYA, Ritsuka and Mash travel to the cavern of the Greater Grail in Fuyuki due to him sensing a presence within. He then tells Ritsuka that he purposely seal away his Noble Phantasm until they were strong enough as a Master, not wanting Ritsuka to rely too much on Noble Phantasms. After he tells Ritsuka to defeat the Servant that guards the Greater Grail as proof of their growth, Mash realizes that he is talking about Heracles, but monster appear to attack the group. After killing the monsters, the group encounters the corrupted Hercales, and proceed to him after EMIYA warns of his multiple lives. After the group defeats the corrupted Heracles, EMIYA congratulates Ritsuka on no longer being a novice.Carnival Phantasm  Archer makes a regular appearance in Carnival Phantasm. Like in Fate/Stay Night, he is Rin's Servant and often follows her orders. However, he acts more light-hearted and comical than his usual self. In episode 5, Archer is shown to have a weakness against Boomelancer, a Noble Phantasm of Berserker that involves throwing Lancer at Archer, sending the latter flying into the distance.Today's Menu for Emiya Family  Archer makes his debut in the series during the second half of the show, though his face becomes obscured or partially shown when the episode centers around Shirou. Archer first appears in Episode 7, interrupting a volleyball match between Rider and Rin vs Shirou and Saber. He and Lancer choose to play against Shirou and Saber, easily overwhelming the pair by taking the game to its logical extreme. Archer also makes a rather obvious attempt to kill Shirou during the match, but misses each time. Archer appears briefly in Episode 8, after Shirou's tendency to clean dust in the Tohsaka mansion reminds Rin of him. Archer is the central character of Episode 11. He is asked by Rin to wait for her and Sakura at the park at 12 o'clock so he could carry their shopping bags, but Lancer unexpectedly shows up and talks Archer into becoming a cook for the cafe Lancer is working at. Archer ends up serving food for Caster, Kuzuki and Saber. Afterwards, Archer discovers he has missed the deadline but was already caught cooking by Rin, who praises Archer for his work.All Around Type-Moon  Archer appears in three chapters of the manga series All Around Type-Moon, mainly as a customer of Ahnenerbe. In chapter four, he is talked into sewing an apron for Neko-Arc by Lancer. In another chapter, he tries (and fails) to teach Rin how to use a laptop, which she somehow uses to conjure Servants directly from the Moon Cell. He appears at the end of another chapter and has a very brief encounter with Kiritsugu Emiya.Capsule Servant Other appearances  In Type-Moon's April Fools' Day 2009, moon.cinemas.jp is a fake movie theater site listing a number of parody films. He was featured in Dog Fate -DooGSDAY-\u00a0(\u3044\u306c\u3075\u3047\u3044\u3068\u3000\u2015DooGSDAY\u2015, Inu Feito \u2015 DooGSDAY \u2015). In April Fools' Day 2010, Tmitter is a fake online social networking, a parody of Twitter. His online user account is @Archer_tm41. In Type-Moon's April Fools' Day 2015, Archer is part of the Imperial Roma enforcer. His Tmitter user account is @tmtt15_archer.Abilities  Archer is not a regular Heroic Spirit who was revered as a hero, but instead a Counter Guardian who made a contract with World for power. He is a Heroic Spirit from the future, so he does not gain any blessings normally provided by fame. He also does not possess any actual Noble Phantasms, but his Reality Marble, Unlimited Blade Works, can be called his Noble Phantasm in a way. He wears a cloak and mantle set that are first rate Conceptual Weapons made from the Holy Shroud of a saint. It does not oppose enemies, but instead the external environment. Due to his nature, he has no fame as a hero and he cannot be recognized by those with knowledge from the Throne of Heroes. This makes him a confusing existence for the other Servants, displaying his projection that turns normally important Noble Phantasms into items that can be discarded and destroyed on a whim, varied abilities that would normally mark the identity of a Servant, and contradictory abilities that do not match any known hero. Lancer believes there should be no Archer with a shield capable of blocking Gae Bolg, and Berserker thinks that being defeated in six different ways, all abilities of the highest class, without learning of the enemy's identity is very strange. In combat, Archer is proven to easily best Caster and True Assassin. Caster believed he wouldn't be able to scratch her within her own domain. But he quickly proved her wrong as he used two attacks capable of killing her, one of which he warned her to dodge. While in a fair fight with True Assassin he nearly killed him having almost sliced his body in half. Which he did all the while protecting Illya and Shirou. He deflected every one of True Assassin's attacks even the ones aimed at Shirou and was able to match True Assassin's speed with ease. Though Archer possesses weak parameters he is a powerful servant regardless of this fact. So he is deemed as a heroic spirit that's unconventionally strong. This is mainly due to the fact that Archer can compensate for his weaknesses by refining what little talents he has. Never focusing on trying to strengthen what he's weak at but rather by advancing his best abilities to their absolute limit.Combat  Due to lacking an actual Noble Phantasm, Archer's basic abilities are below those of other Servants. His main strength lies within his versatility and adaptability, shown through his exceptional use of tactics and battle experience making his combat style very distinct from those of other Servants. His strength does not come from natural talent like Rin or Saber, but instead from single-minded refining of what little talent he had in life. He had nothing at first, and through improving himself for reason that he was not extraordinary, his techniques trained by his will alone reached the point where it is obvious to Shirou that he should be naturally considered strong. He is not fixated on the exact method of winning, opening many possibilities not available to those who fight with chivalry and codes of honor. Unlimited Blade Works is his sole magecraft, allowing for the use of Reinforcement and Projection. As a \"blacksmith Heroic Spirit\", it includes the \u201call the elements necessary to shape swords\u201d, allowing for the replication of Noble Phantasms. All weapons are copied upon seeing them once, he has thousands stored as of the Fifth Holy Grail War, and all can be freely deployed. Many varieties of weapons can be summoned for melee combat, though he primarily utilizes Kanshou and Bakuya. Swords can also be summoned and modified to be fired as arrows and utilized as Broken Phantasms by overloading them with energy to generate overwhelming destructive power from exploding upon contact. He also has the ability to summon weapons in the air and fire them like arrows in the same way as Gilgamesh uses his Gate of Babylon. He can fight in a variety of ways depending on the situation, allowing him to match or even exceed other Servants even without an actual Noble Phantasm of his own. Utilizing Broken Phantasms requires for the destruction of a Noble Phantasm, so it is not something able to be utilized by a normal Servant without sacrificing their strength. Due to him being able to replicate as many weapons as he wishes, the use of Broken Phantasms became a trump card available only to him. He can turn the odds in his favor by assaulting melee Servants with such long range attacks. Even if he attempts to replicate an Excalibur-class holy sword, he does not have the magical energy necessary to bring out its full potential and may simply end up fading away after using all his energy in a suicidal attack.Close combat  Though he is of the Archer class, which originally focuses on long range combat, he is adept at melee combat, and due to his wish to conceal his trump card, he mainly focuses on melee tactics, primarily utilizing Kanshou and Bakuya when engaging other Servants. Even when told to fight seriously by utilizing a bow as expected of the Archer class, he continues to rush into close combat without intentions to draw his bow. Utilizing his unorthodox tactics, he is even able to slay Berserker six times. He will also use other weapons like Caladbolg II to thrust at the opponent's heart or Durandal to perform powerful strikes. Kanshou and Bakuya are his preferred weapons, and his usage of them has allowed him to develop a style of fighting perfectly suited to him. Though he can fight with a single blade, he generally wields them both at once. The advantage of projection allows for him to replace swords if they are destroyed or if he is disarmed. He has no trouble projecting twenty-eight pairs during a strenuous clash consisting of over a hundred strikes and constantly being disarmed. His greatest strategy, Triple-Linked Crane Wings, involves utilizing multiple projected pairs in succession to completely seal the opponent.Ranged combat  Archer utilizes a bow that he projects when he does make use of projectiles, which, along with his armor, is made from a special material that has yet to be discovered by mankind as of the present time. Archer's Bow\u00a0(\u30a2\u30fc\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u306e\u5f13, \u0100ch\u0101 no Yumi) is a matte black, western-style straight bow, with a simple design that was constructed to be resistant enough to fire Noble Phantasms. It is a completely original weapon, a projection whose structure and composition is not directly taken from another hero's bow. He often uses regular arrows for quick and accurate attacks that cost less magical energy than Noble Phantasms. Their accuracy is spot-on, and their power is still great enough to bring down houses with a small barrage released in quick succession. Releasing over a dozen arrows at once, they are accurately fired at the opponent whether as a sneak attack or support for another. He is capable of performing Broken Phantasm shots from various distances, from hundreds of meters away up to four kilometers away from the target. His Clairvoyance, a visual ability also called Hawk Eye\u00a0(\u9df9\u306e\u77b3) that affects the accuracy of bows, allows him to execute his \"ultra long-range sniping\" precisely even against targets moving at high speeds as long as they are within a four kilometer range. With accuracy transcending the realm of men, it is an ability often used for scouting that is able to fully survey the town simply upon looking down from a high location. Utilizing the \"must-have ability\" of the Archer class, such strikes greatly differ from his regular arrows, and they are a means to certainly kill the opponent. Differing from his former Japanese shooting method, nocking the arrow in the palm of the left hand, Archer utilizes the traditional European method of nocking the arrow over the back of the left hand. He is skilled enough to mark two enemies and fire a single arrow with the intention of striking both, surpassing the normal rules being unable to alter its course. He can make use of specific strategies to defeat opponents from long range, such as Saber, who would not fall in single combat easily even inside Unlimited Blade Works. Burdening her with protecting Shirou and keeping her from utilizing Excalibur, he is free to fire upon her without worry of being counterattacked and increase the power each time. If such tactics are unavailable, such as with Assassin, it is possible that fighting directly may lead to his defeat. Utilizing sniping can cause him to falter when suddenly forced into close combat, as returning to his true method of attack leaves him unable to draw his sword and respond properly due to focusing on his arrows. Nasu stated in an interview that Archer would be able to defeat Rider through range combat as he said \"If you think about it, Archer will win, but at long range.\" In Fate/Hollow Ataraxia, Archer used his advantage of long range combat to defeat Saber. As he was able to snipe at her from a building many kilometers away. And the only way Saber was able to defeat Archer was by having Shirou use his command spell to transport her to Archer's location. So under normal circumstances she wouldn't've been able to do so, due to not being able to close the distance between Archer and her with her own abilties alone. Though she was burdened by having to protect Shirou (Avenger) during the fight so it's undetermined what the outcome of the battle would've been had she not needed to protect someone else. But it should be noted that Archer has twice defeated two enemy servants while forced to protect Shirou himself. When discussing the terms of a match up between Archer and Saber, Nasu stated that \"It might really depend on the wit of their masters' not their own in determining who has the upper hand.\"Magecraft  Although classified under the Archer class, he was not a swordsman nor an archer in life, but a magus at his core relying on his one spell, Unlimited Blade Works, to fight. Despite being a skilled combatant, his true unique strength lies within the manufacturing of weapons rather than their use. His abilities in life were unremarkable overall, utilizing Reinforcement with difficulty and the \"structural analysis\" step of projection more often than anything else. Only Projection had any worth, having granted him the many Noble Phantasms and combat skills they hold. Aside from Projection, he can also use magic detection and magic resistance, which are considered very basic. He does not posses the ability to utilize offensive magecraft that work around the lines of nature interference. His dark skin, white hair, and gray eyes are a side effect of extensively using Projection Magecraft. He has weak Magic Resistance, D rank, that is only the equivalent of an anti-magic amulet. He can nullify spells of one bar, but anything higher than that will annul the resistance. It can easily be overcome by a relatively strong magus, as his affinity with magecraft is much worse than Heroic Spirits of ancient times. He may have been a magus possessing the unusual Projection magecraft, but they were those who saw magecraft and even Magic as commonplace. Due to that resulting in his low ability, even spells greater than two steps can be fatal to him. Without any support, he is at a serious disadvantage against a Caster, capable of great sorceries and ritual spells, and even spells from magi Masters must be watched carefully. When holding both Kanshou and Bakuya, his magic resistance is improved, and he proves capable of deflecting even Caster's A-ranked spells, though they still pose fatal danger should they strike him.Eye of the Mind  Eye of the Mind (True) is a danger-avoidance ability that utilizes the intelligence collected up to the current time as the basis to predict the opponent\u2019s activity and change the current situation. Servants like Lancer and Saber cannot be matched in direct combat under normal circumstances. They are too fast and strong for him to last more than a few blows before falling to their strength, should he take them on without any strategy. He reads the oncoming attacks and counterattacks ahead of time, constantly thinking tens of steps ahead in order continuously prolong his survival by seconds in avoiding blows, parrying, and striking back without being overwhelmed. It is \"combat logic\" that utilizes calm analysis to take information obtained from the current situation and enemy's abilities to make predictions, and makes use of his cultivated battle experience to plan his attack. In spite of danger, he takes consideration of all possible actions in a particular situation, and if there is even a one percent chance of a comeback, the ability improves the chances of success. Although superior to Shirou, the circumstances of their battle lead to Archer being unable to see through Shirou's \"passion-infused strike which puts 'ideal' on the line\", and he ultimately is struck by it. He does not to answer as to why he did not block an attack he should have been able to easily block, and it is possible he does not know the answer. His nerves of steel, his mind's eye obtained through experience, is nothing extraordinary compared to Saber's Instinct, but noted to be the only skill that he possesses, a weapon wielded by a mortal that anyone can gain through tenacious training. It is the result of an overwhelming amount of combat experience, allowing him to see even Lancer's thrusts, fast enough that they are not visible to even his honed eyes. Though Lancer is far superior, Archer is able to guide the fight to his advantage through his experience, utilizing his inferiority as a weapon to control the attacks coming at him. Archer battles such opponents by leaving fatal openings, dodging them and risking instant death instead of slowly being cut up, which would ensure his loss as the fight drags out. Through battle, he is able to think of at least thirty ways to \"show an opening\", and this allows him to match Lancer's onslaught without being overwhelmed. Although he should not be a match because he should only be able to put up a true fight as a long-range archer and holds no prospect for victory in close combat, he is able to block Lancer's full force strikes, leaving Lancer perplexed at the situation and noting Archer's mysterious strength.Independent Action  Archer's ability to survive alone is extremely great, displayed in his Independent Action. Independent Action allows him to act without constant support from his Master, and while normal Servants fade within hours after losing their Master, he can last much longer due to the ability. He can also survive for a short period of time even should he sustain lethal damage to his spiritual core. Servants of his rank normally have two days in the world without active support from a Master, but that figure is based upon maximally conserving energy while also avoiding battle and the usage of Noble Phantasms. Archer is able to switch Masters, act independently without a Master and do battle with ten percent of his abilities left, sustain ultimately fatal injuries, observe the battle between Shirou and Gilgamesh in spiritual form, protect Shirou with Rho Aias, save Rin and Shinji from the mud, and then finally eliminate Gilgamesh to save Shirou in the Unlimited Blade Works scenario. His final attack is a regular arrow instead of a Noble Phantasm, and due to his gradual fading after the attack, it shows the final limits of his materialization. Even after sustaining a lethal injury, he is able to survive long enough in the Heaven's Feel scenario to allow for his arm to be transplanted due to the ability.Forms and Alternate Versions Blackened  EMIYA is shown to appear in Singularity F. The blackening seems to have affected Archer to a degree, as not only is his equipment and appearance different, his preference for combat and tactics has changed as well. Discarding the stance of only drawing his swords when the time is right, Archer instead uses his bow extensively and attacks as soon as he spots an enemy. It is possible that given the effects of blackening, Archer's Eye of the Mind (True) skill has been downgraded, reflected by his simpler mentality as his snarky and analytical personality has been replaced with a sour and aggressive one, along with an inability or unwillingness to use his usual more elaborate tactics. A version of blackened Archer appears in TYPE-MOON ACE VOL. 11 with his left eye completely blackened, the red garments absent and his shirt extending down to his knees like a waist-cape. This Archer continuously wears a smile on his face, even as his body slowly disintegrates into nothing. Like the anime version that appeared in First Order, this Archer primarily uses a bow.Development  The scene \"Decisive Battle\" in Fate/hollow ataraxia shows Archer remembering the very first scene of the Prologue of Fate/stay night with Shirou Emiya summoning Saber, and though it was meant to show that the Prologue scene was from Archer's perspective, Kinoko Nasu was surprised when nobody made the connection.Reception References English  Nasu-san CHECK! The class of the representatives of close-range and long-range combat. Saber, who would take her sword in any condition whatsoever and Archer who would fight using a strategy of victory. The highlight won't just be the different battle styles, but the difference between their personalities. However, even with UBW, it's questionable whether he could hold Saber back in single combat. One definite hit from sniping and one absolute blast of death from her Holy Sword. It might really depend on the wit of their Masters not their own in determining who has the upper hand.English  Nasu-san CHECK! If it's a straight out death match, then Archer will win. But Assassin is an oddity that fights under different battle conditions from the other Servants. While many Servants are offensive, Assassin is defensive. At a Servant-killing battlefield like Ryuudou Temple and with Caster's anti-sorcery defensive barrier, sorcery and Noble Phantasm power is decreased significantly. As a result, if it's not a powerful Noble Phantasm, then he won't take a fatal wound. Which means that the battle between the two is clearly swordsmanship. With Archer having his sniping sealed off to him due to the terrain effect, could Archer actually lose...?English  Summary: And again, Nasu pointed out on his blog that it meant the very start of the prologue was from Archer's POV and he was surprised nobody got it.Fate/Extra  Fate/EXTRA\u00a0(\u30d5\u30a7\u30a4\u30c8/\u30a8\u30af\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9, Feito/ekusutora) is a Japanese Dungeon Role Playing Game for PlayStation Portable created by Type-Moon and Image Epoch, published by Marvelous Entertainment. The game is a part of Marvelous Entertainment's TYPE-MOON\u00d7RPG PROJECT.Story Setting  The universe of Extra shares the events of the Fate/stay night universe until a \"certain major incident\" in the 1970s that caused the world's mana to start drying up causing it to split off into its own separate universe. As of the 2030s, the world's mana was completely gone. The world is set in a school called Tsukumihara Academy, a fictional place existing within an artificial environment called the Moon Cell. There, the Moon Cell orchestrates a replication of the Holy Grail War using a system called Serial Phantasm or SE.RA.PH, which handles the summoning of Servants. Servant data is taken from the Moon Cell Automaton, a spiritual computer system built on the lunar surface by a pre-human civilization and discovered by humans in the year 2032. The Automaton has monitored and recorded all occurrences on the Earth (including the activities of human heroes) since time immemorial. In this sense, it is similar to the Throne of Heroes. Unlike the Fate/stay night counterpart, all involved are either human personalities that function as NPCs, or Spiritron-Hackers, resulting in what Rin herself called a \"fair system,\" as it does not involve innocents. In addition, Servants are to convey the will of the Moon Cell above their own needs. Each of the 128 participants in the war must duel the other Masters in a place called the Arena, where failure results in deletion from the digital world and death in the other. When only one remains, the \"Holy Grail\" shall grant the victor's wish.Plot  Waking up in a strange virtual world with no recollection of the past, the main character finds themselves forced to fight for survival in a war they do not understand for a prize beyond value; the opportunity to have one\u2019s wish granted. With only an enigmatic \u201cServant\u201d by their side, Hakuno Kishinami will have to face both friends and foes in battles to the death in order to not only gain possession of a mysterious object known as the \u201cHoly Grail,\u201d but also to find the answer to the most important question of all: \u201cWho am I?\u201dCharacters  Apart from the main Fate characters, several newer ones were introduced in the game and also plays a role in the story. Depending on some choices, the masters that the player fights and their respective servant classes change. The Rin route has the player ally with Rin Tohsaka and fight Lancer Vlad III and Berserker Lu Bu, and the Rani route has the player ally with Rani VIII and fight Lancer Cu Chulainn and Berserker Arcueid Brunestud.Masters  Various unnamed \"student\" participants also act as masters. There are total of 128 masters.Gameplay  Fate/Extra's gameplay incorporates dungeon crawling and a high-school theme; although the theme very quickly becomes a distant background element as it is the battlefield of the Holy Grail War. The player, after proceeding through the prologue with a nameless character, chooses a gender and a name for Hakuno Kishinami, and one of three available Servants: Saber, Archer, or Caster. Exploring is done in the school and inside a virtual space called the Arena, overseen by the Serial Phantasm or SE.RA.PH, which is part of the Moon Cell that controls the Holy Grail. In the Arena, monsters are abundant and are used by Masters for training purposes. Masters may also engage one another for brief periods of time to test and learn about each other before the SE.RA.PH forcibly separates the combatants. The SE.RA.PH also oversees the official Elimination Round battles between Masters at the end of each week, located in the Colliseum at the heart of each Arena... and ensures that the loser of such a battle perishes on Earth as well as in the Moon Cell. Combat is carried out in six-move turns, with the core combat moves operating in a fashion similar to rock-paper-scissors; heavy Break attacks smash through defensive Guards, quick Attacks can strike a foe before they can land a Break, and a Guard can deflect a light Attack and allow the defender to retaliate. Successfully landing multiple damaging blows (not counting the trivial damage a successful Guard takes from an Attack) increases the damage each move delivers, and delivering three blows in a row, as noted by the \"chain counter\", allows a combatant to use a powerful Extra Attack outside of the regular move order with no retaliation possible. Servants, and a select few monsters, may also use Skills, which can either provide a passive combat benefit or attack a foe directly, causing damage or inflicting a status ailment - or both, depending on the Skill in question. Offensive Skills override all other moves and the use of a Skill prevents a foe's offensive move from occurring (it does, however, also reset the chain counter of both combatants, for better or worse); if both combatants use an offensive Skill at the same time, the combatant with the higher Agility goes first, but both skills are used... assuming the slower combatant survives being hit. Passive Skills, such as Caster's Spirit Theft, also occur before normal attacks, however using this kind of Skill leaves the user completely open to an Attack or a Break. Masters may also use Items or Code Cast spells (the Fate/Extra version of Magecraft, effectively), which occur before any other actions in a given move - if both Masters act in a given move, the Agility of the Servants again determine who acts first. Items almost universally provide restorative effects for a Servant, while Code Casts can vary in utility from healing to increasing or decreasing parameters to interrupting and stunning a Servant using a Skill and more. Finally, under certain conditions Servants may utilize their Noble Phantasm fully, which have different effects depending on the Servant. Information is a key tool in the Holy Grail War of Fate/Extra, and is the primary impetus for the school exploration section of the game. Knowledge of your opponent results in being able to see several of their moves beforehand (and crucially, full knowledge of an enemy Servant including their true name, allows you to anticipate when a Noble Phantasm will be used and thus avoid getting obliterated by it). While information about the monsters simply comes from beating them repeatedly, knowledge of the enemy Masters and their Servants must come from a combination of learning about them in the school section and occasionally confronting them in the Arena. The exploration sections also advance the primary plot, and you have a private room within the school, allowing Hakuno to spend time with their Servant and learn more about them. You can also speak with various unnamed Masters participating in the Holy Grail War, many having their own stories which range from the humorous to the tragic.Development  The game was first announced in the September 2009 issue of Famitsu. Marvelous Entertainment teamed up with Image Epoch and Type-Moon to develop a re-imaging of the visual novel series.Staff Release History  The game was released on July 22, 2010. The game was released in North America on November 1, 2011. There were some mistranslations, such as a character calling Hakuno Kishinami a \"ghost in the machine\" when he was speaking of his own prowess in the original. Fate/Extra CCC was later released as a companion game that occurs simultaneously with Fate/Extra.Music  In the first trailer, ALI PROJECT performed the official theme song of the game titled \"Ranse Eroica\"\u00a0(\u4e82\u4e16\u30a8\u30ed\u30a4\u30ab, Chaotic Heroic).Sound Drama  The sound drama retells the game story with the male Hakuno as the lead protagonist. He is named with the game default name Hakuno Kishinami and he is voiced by Atsushi Abe. His chosen servant is Saber.Release Date  At Type-Moon Festival, it was announced that a Fate/Extra sound drama would be released around winter 2012.Manga  The game received a Manga adaptation illustrated by Robi\u301cna and published by Kadokawa Shoten. The manga was compiled in 6 volumes. The first volume was released on September 26, 2011 and the second volume on March 22, 2012. The third volume was released on December 10, 2012, the fourth on March 25, 2013, the fifth on March 26, 2014 and the sixth on December 10, 2014. The main character of the manga is the male Hakuno Kishinami, with Saber acting as his Servant during the Moon Holy Grail War.References External links List of minor characters in the Fate series Noble Phantasm  Noble Phantasms\u00a0(\u30ce\u30a6\u30d6\u30eb\u30fb\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30bf\u30ba\u30e0, Nouburu Fantazumu), in Japanese literary called Precious Tools\u00a0(\u5b9d\u5177, H\u014dgu) are \"crystallized mysteries\", powerful armaments made using the imagination of humans as their core, and weapons or abilities owned by Heroic Spirits. They are the embodiment of the ultimate mysteries of a hero that symbolizes one's existence through historical facts and anecdotes. They can be physical weapons, such as swords, lances, and bows, or support items, such as rings and crowns. They can also be abstract concepts, like unique abilities, unique means of attacks, curses, and changes to the environment and its physical properties. When summoned as Servants in the Holy Grail War, they are the trump cards of the heroes that allow them to overcome others in battle.Origins  The Noble Phantasms of all Heroic Spirits are said to have originated from the Gate of Babylon, the treasury of Gilgamesh. They were the greatest treasures of the world collected throughout his lifetime, nameless, splendid weapons, that acted as the Noble Phantasms' prototypes before becoming the objects of faith that act as the foundations for their legends. They spread throughout the world after his death, eventually becoming Noble Phantasms. Even though it can be considered a paradox, unless Gilgamesh as the original hero possesses them, they cannot be handed down as the Noble Phantasms possessed by the later heroes derived from his legend. Some abilities solely wielded by Divine Spirits like Sarasvati Meltout and Eightfold Blessing of Amaterasu are called Noble Phantasms, so it is unknown if they also fall into that categorization. It is impossible for myths and legends to start from nothing, so they all have common points acting as the foundations that became the model for the legend. Those like demonic swords and holy swords were granted names and abilities once such legends begin to flourish in their lands of origination, but those within Gilgamesh's treasury are their forms before they were granted such through myths and legends. Those possessed by Gilgamesh are the true original models, different than those that have been renewed from older Noble Phantasms over the millennia. Though differing in appearance, renewed weapons hold similar true natures, concepts for their creation, and souls. As with the progression of Merodach, Gram, and Caliburn, all carrying the \"foundation of the sacred right to select the king\", each cycle of transmigration causes the weapon to become weaker. Gilgamesh claims that the \"children cannot defeat their parents\", with each new incarnation simply being a deteriorated imitation that cannot match the original model, but Shirou Emiya claims \"but there is no rule that an imitation cannot defeat the original\" while taunting him. There are cases where the nature of the Noble Phantasm is not actually a true crystallized mystery, such as Archer's Unlimited Blade Works, which is magecraft that symbolizes him, and Li Shu Wen's No Second Strike, which is the quintessence of his martial arts. Sasaki Kojiro is a case of a Servant without a Noble Phantasm due to his status as a wraith, but his technique, Tsubame Gaeshi, has managed to be on par with Noble Phantasms without the use of magecraft. Enkidu is described more as a \"Noble Phantasm of the gods\" than a Heroic Spirit, and Kingprotea is a being whose self can be treated as a Noble Phantasm.Characteristics  Noble Phantasms make up part of the existence of Heroic Spirits, the anecdotes about their prowess and weaponry all becoming part of the very \"symbol\" of their existence. As the \"ultimate mysteries\" and embodiment of the heroes, they are trump cards carried by each to be used at an appropriate time. Most Noble Phantasms will belong only to a single hero, activated only by them, their true owners, by channeling magical energy into them and releasing their True Names. There are cases as with the Hanging Gardens of Babylon which is possessed by multiple heroes, Nebuchadnezzar II possessing it by deed and Semiramis possessing it by distortion of fact. They each possess a great amount of magical energy that show them being things \"outside of normality\", miracles exceeding both humanity and magecraft. Noble Phantasms represents the legends of Heroic Spirit, in other words, it would most likely reveal the identity to other Masters if used. For example, if a servant used a Noble Phantasm in a one-on-one tournament format in the Moon Cell Holy Grail War, the leakage of information will lead to defeat because it will give clues to the Servant's real name. It can be said that a Master winning without the use of a Noble Phantasm(s) is an excellent Master. They are brought into the world with Servants upon their summoning, normally complied out of magical energy and granted the ability to materialize and dematerialize at the wielder's will. Compared to the Servants who sometimes also possesses normal weapons as well, they give off a clear level of magical energy that shows that they are Noble Phantasms. Most Heroic Spirits will only possess one Noble Phantasm, while those who sometimes obtain two or three would normally be the absolute limit, and it may be possible for some to have treasured three or four extraordinary weapons in their life.Medusa, with three, is noted to be exceptional among other Servants, and Perseus being granted five during his lifetime is the most given to a single hero in Greek mythology. Gilgamesh is unique in possessing an unlimited amount within his treasury due to having all of them. No Name Assassin possesses eighteen of the nineteen Zabaniya Noble Phantasms. Perseus possesses six with the inclusion of Bellerophon in his legend, Achilles possesses five, and others like Astolfo, Saint George, and Karna possess four each. It is possible that Noble Phantasms will be granted to heroes even if they had nothing to do with them in life, such as the misunderstandings of countless people thinking Semiramis had some connection to the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, causing it to become her Noble Phantasm. Noble Phantasms are ranked by their strength and mystery. Those called \"extremely average\" are around the level of B Rank which have strength able to be represented through numbers and show only output of pure physical damage. G\u00e1e Bolg's thrown strike is a pure destructive attack, while its piercing version carries a conceptual effect, a \"destiny interference type\", that falls into a special category. Differing from regular attacks, even a C Rank Noble Phantasm is the equivalent of an A or A+ ranked normal attack. It is possible for the ranks to be increased or decreased depending upon certain circumstances. G\u00e1e Bolg can temporarily be strengthened to A Rank through the use of Runes, while Clarent loses ranks from having been obtained and used improperly. Defensive Noble Phantasms like God Hand and Armor of Fafnir use the concept of ranks as a means of defense rather than the relative power the ranks represent. Fortress Noble Phantasms are very rare, fewer in number than even the rare Anti-Fortress Noble Phantasms. Even those that own them like C\u00fa Chulainn can only use it within his homeland of Ireland. Floating fortresses like the Hanging Gardens of Babylon are close to zero. The ability to kill hundreds and thousands of people is a trait possessed by Anti-Army and Anti-Fortress Noble Phantasms, but those capable of killing over ten thousand like Kazikli Bey are few in number. Normally limited to the exclusive usage of their owners due to being tied directly into their legends, the Noble Phantasms of heroes being wielded by other heroes will not normally be able to be wielded properly by them or activated with their True Names, whether stolen or freely borrowed. There are specific Noble Phantasms like Knight of Owner and Sword Hunt that can temporarily transfer the ownership of armament Noble Phantasms, allowing Lancelot to wield them with great skill and Toyotomi Hideyoshi to handle them with less skill than the original wielder but also be able to unleash their True Names under certain conditions. Under certain exceptions, it may be possible for a Heroic Spirit to freely grant usage of the Noble Phantasm, requiring the conditions of \u201cbeing where he is making a contract, instead of being in opposition, of his own volition\" and \"the Noble Phantasm not requiring considerable skill and power to invoke its True Name.\u201d Even with such conditions fulfilled, Rider of Black borrowing Akhilleus Kosmos from Rider of Red also required the respective episodes in their legends of \u201cthe giver (Achilles) where he loans his Noble Phantasms\u201d and \"the receiver (Astolfo) where he borrows a Noble Phantasm.\u201d The most common Noble Phantasms are holy swords and demonic swords used by heroes during their lives. There is no specific form into which they must fit. They can be the weapons the hero used in life, and they can be famous anecdotes about the hero given form upon their ascension. While they can be physical weapons, the act of throwing many weapons at once or a \"sword that splits into an infinite number\" could be Noble Phantasms in themselves.Rin provides several examples of a Noble Phantasm's power, mentioning dragon-slaying swords, shoes that can run far and wide, god-killing demonic swords, and Hazanken, a sword in Chinese legends able to even slice through mountains that can only be swung once. There are those like Ionioi Hetairoi that is Alexander the Great's life sublimated into a Noble Phantasm due to having been acknowledged by all as the King of Conquerors, and there are those like Zabaniya that are Noble Phantasms because of their status as that which establishes their users as Hassan-i-Sabbah rather than having been recorded in history. Most Noble Phantasms are simply regarded as lost legends in modern times, but there are some that have remained throughout the millennia. There are humans like Bazett Fraga McRemitz and Gray that can actualize Noble Phantasms that have been passed down throughout their bloodlines for generations. Others like Avalon, Jack the Ripper's knives, and one owned by Qin Shi Huang have remained throughout the ages and act as catalysts for summoning their wielders as Servants. It is possible to sacrifice a Noble Phantasm for an attack that is one rank higher, which is called a Broken Phantasm: The Destroyed Illusion\u00a0(, ). If a Noble Phantasm is packed with magical energy, it can be made to explode after striking its target. It is nearly impossible to repair a destroyed Noble Phantasm, and since they are the trump cards of Heroic Spirits, they are unlikely to take such measures. Archer is an exception, as he can reproduce as many copies of Noble Phantasms as his magical energy will allow due to Tracing, allowing him to also counterbalance the fact that all of his projections are lowered by one rank. If a Servant wishes to destroy their own weapon in another fashion, it is much easier than destroying one in normal combat. Lancer is able to easily break G\u00e1e Buidhe in half without any effort.Activation  Similar as to how spells are required to activate magecraft, it is necessary to awaken and activate Noble Phantasms with their True Name. While something like G\u00e1e Bolg is a splendid spear with history and itself a Noble Phantasm, it does not appear inherently extraordinary by itself, only able to display its full potential beyond the realm of normal weapons when imbued with magical energy and activated with the recitation of its True Name. It is possible to give an alternate name to a Noble Phantasm in the case of its True Name being forgotten like with Casseur de Logistille, but while it will be reflected in the Servant's status as such, it cannot activate its true power without it. Sakata Kintoki activates his Golden Eater and Golden Spark with those \"suspicious names\", while the True Names are very likely different. For weapons that release a great attack, they only reflect their power upon having their True Name called, so striking with them as regular armaments will only reflect the physical abilities of the wielder. There are a number of Noble Phantasms that display passive abilities that continue to function without any need to call out their names called Continuously Active-Type Noble Phantasms\u00a0(\u5e38\u6642\u767a\u52d5\u578b\u306e\u5b9d\u5177, J\u014dji Hatsud\u014d-Gata no H\u014dgu), such as God Hand, Crying Warmonger and Kavacha and Kundala. It may be the case that there are conditions required before Noble Phantasms can be activated, and some rare ones require materials to construct. The most common of such cases are those that still exist in the world in the present day that requires the Noble Phantasm to be obtained, while rarer cases require actual materials for their entire construction. While normally complete existences, there are those that are too large to be possessed by a single hero and those that were incomplete but still recorded in the hero's legend. Noble Phantasms that can be utilized by Masters in the Holy Grail Wars are called Master's Noble Phantasms\u00a0(\u30de\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u5b9d\u5177, Masut\u0101 no H\u014dgu). While Avalon lacks functions as a Noble Phantasm without Saber present, Avalon can be sealed within a person to allow them to experience its healing effects so long as Saber is present. Qin Shi Huang's can be used by someone even without him being summoned, and Karna has shown the ability to give his armor to his Master.Classification  Noble Phantasms are classified by their effectiveness against enemies. One Noble Phantasm may have multiple classifications depending on its abilities. Along with Noble Phantasms, there are also the alternate descriptors of Secret Technique\u00a0(\u5965\u7fa9, \u014cgi) for Jumping the Eight Ships at Dan-no-ura and Mystic Sword\u00a0(\u9b54\u5263, Maken) for Tsubame Gaeshi.List of known Noble Phantasms Non-Standard Noble Phantasms  Some objects that are not normally Noble Phantasms can temporarily become Noble Phantasms under certain circumstances.Other Noble Phantasms References Fate/Zero  Fate/Zero\u00a0(\u30d5\u30a7\u30a4\u30c8\uff0f\u30bc\u30ed, Feito/Zero) is a novel written by Gen Urobuchi as a prequel to Fate/stay night, with illustrations by Takashi Takeuchi. The project was supervised by Kinoko Nasu, who looked over the draft for the new characters and the plot. The first volume was released on December 12, 2006, and is a collaboration between TYPE-MOON and fellow developer Nitro+. The second volume was released on March 31, 2007. The third volume was released on July 27, 2007. The fourth and final volume was released on December 29, 2007, along with the Fate/Zero Original Image Soundtrack \"Return to Zero\". Four sets of Drama CDs were released from 2008 to 2010. From 2011 to 2012, an anime adaption of the series was produced by ufotable.Story Setting  Because of certain minor details such as whether Gilgamesh had seen Excalibur or not during the 4th Holy Grail War, Fate/Zero is treated as being in an extremely similar parallel world to Fate/stay night. Fate/Zero takes place 10 years prior to the events of Fate/stay night in the year 1994, detailing the events of the Fourth Holy Grail War in Fuyuki City. Originally founded by the Einzbern, Tohsaka, and Matou families, the war involves seven Masters and seven Servants under seven classes: Saber, Lancer, Archer, Rider, Caster, Assassin and Berserker.Plot  After being defeated in three successive wars for the Holy Grail, the Einzbern family is determined to win the next one at any cost and elects to hire the notorious Magus Killer, Kiritsugu Emiya, to become their representative in spite of his reputation as an unconventional and ruthless hitman. For the next eight years, he prepares the war in the Einzbern stronghold while unexpectedly forming a family with Irisviel von Einzbern, who is to become the vessel for the Grail, and their daughter, Illyasviel. However, Kiritsugu must contend with six formidable opponents, all participating in the war for their own reasons. From one of the three founding families, the magus Tokiomi Tohsaka wants to achieve Akasha through the Holy Grail, receiving support from the priest Risei Kotomine and his son, Kirei Kotomine, who is also unexpectedly a master in the war. Unlike Tokiomi, Kirei has no direction in life and soon sets his sights on Kiritsugu as an answer to the frustrating lack of meaning in his life. Meanwhile, Kariya Matou becomes a Master after learning Tokiomi's younger daughter, Sakura, was adopted into the Matou family. In hopes of saving her from suffering at the hands of Zouken Matou, he agrees to win the Holy Grail in exchange for her freedom to return to her family. After learning of the war and taken by arrogance, Clock Tower magus and lecturer Kayneth El-Melloi Archibald decides to join the battle to increase his own prominence within the Mage's Association. However, his dismissive attitude towards the radical theories of his student, Waver Velvet, drives the young man to steal Lord El-Melloi's artifact and participate in the war in order to force the Mage's Association to recognize his genius. When a seventh magus fails to answer the Grail's call, a serial killer named Ryuunosuke Uryuu is chosen to become the final Master in the war. Seeking exciting new ways of killing people, he winds up summoning a Servant from an occult book and proceeds to commit as many unusual murders as he can with the help of his Servant. As the war begins, only one will emerge victorious.Characters  The storyline of Fate/Zero takes place 10 years prior to the events of Fate/stay night, detailing the events of the Fourth Holy Grail War war in Fuyuki City . It includes the following characters: Humans Servants\nServants participating in the Fourth Holy Grail War and their true identities include the following: Minor CharactersDevelopment  The project began when Nitro+ writer, Gen Urobuchi, met with Kinoko Nasu and Takashi Takeuchi. Takeuchi suggested a prequel proposal to Urobuchi, who had been experiencing writer's block while attempting to write a happy story. Urobuchi, who was known for his tragic stories, agreed to become the writer for the project. Though Urobuchi is the writer for the series, the project was supervised by Kinoko Nasu, who looked over the draft for the new characters and the plot. In Fate/hollow ataraxia, there was teaser poster of Fate/Zero in one of the background images. It is unknown if the novels were in development at the time.Light novel  The first volume was released on December 12, 2006, and the fourth and final volume was released on December 29, 2007.Sound Drama  Four sets of Drama CDs were released from 2008 to 2010. While Takeuchi Takashi draws the Drama CD covers, Shidzuki Morii provides several illustrations of the Sound Drama. Following the airing of the anime adaption, there is also one drama CD per anime box set written by Gen Urobuchi released from 2011 to 2012.Anime  The 2011 issue of Type-Moon Ace magazine reported that an anime adaption of Fate/Zero was green-lit for production. It is produced by studio Ufotable and began airing in October 2011. This is the third anime production in the Fate series, following the 24 episode Fate/stay night adaptation and the Unlimited Blade Works movie. Nico Nico Douga and Aniplex simulcasted Fate/Zero worldwide with eight different language subtitles (Korean, Chinese (Traditional & Simplified), English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish). Aniplex of America sells the Fate/Zero Blu-ray Boxset, with English subtitles in North America through Rightstuf.com. The anime was originally slated to run continuously for all episodes, but was later given a season break between 13 and 14 to allow for better animation. The first season ran from October to December 2011 and the second season ran from April to June 2012. The first opening song was \"Oath Sign\" by LiSA and the second one was \"to the beginning\" by Kalafina .Einzbern Consultation Room  The Blu-ray Boxsets each featured three episodes of Please!

It features alternate versions of Irisviel von Einzbern and Taiga Fujimura, Student No. 0, explaining various details unable to be elaborated on within the anime, and they speak with the various defeated Servants left with regrets after having been killed.References External Links Berserker (Fate/Zero)  Berserker\u00a0(\u30d0\u30fc\u30b5\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc, B\u0101s\u0101k\u0101) is the Berserker-class Servant of Kariya Matou during the Fourth Holy Grail War of Fate/Zero. He is one of the Servants of Ritsuka Fujimaru of the Grand Orders conflicts of Fate/Grand Order.Profile Identity  Berserker's True Name is Lancelot, also known as the Knight of the Lake\u00a0(\u6e56\u306e\u9a0e\u58eb, Miz\u016bmi no kishi), the person serving as a negative symbol of the Arthurian legend. The \"Knight of the Lake\", admired as the strongest even among the Knights of the Round Table. He was extremely loyal to King Arthur as one of the Knights of the Round Table. Lancelot's downfall began when he fell in love with Artoria's queen, Guinevere. It is said that the tragic love story of Diarmuid Ua Duibhne and Grainne later became the story model of Guinevere and Lancelot.Life  He was originally born and raised in France. Having lost his parents as a child, he was raised by the fairy of the lake Nimue and thus gained the alias \"Knight of the Lake\". He had heard rumors of the King of Britain. He believed the King of Knights in Britain was pure nonsense. He began to compare himself with the King of Knights until he decided to travel to Britain to see the legendary king with his own eyes. He met the King as soon as he landed in Britain in the midst of battle. It carved a deep impression of the King when he saw the sight of a young boy riding on his horse, gallantly swinging her sword in a horde of invaders. It proved how wrong he was, the requirement to battle day and night was not physical attributes but it was one who holds unwavering convictions. Lancelot had fought together with the King in that battle, and for his accomplishments he was granted the honor of speaking with her as a friend and invited to Camelot as a guest. Before long, he began desiring a seat on the Round Table. He became a knight among the Round table and saw many battles. He had many famous exploits, including once hiding his name and disguising himself to enter a horse race for the sake of a friend\u2019s honor. Even after falling into a trap and being forced to face the enemy's blades with only his bare hands, he had proved victorious with his skilled fighting prowess using only an elm branch.Downfall  When Sir Tristan left the castle saying King Arthur does not understand how others feel. It was those words that began to trigger his insanity. Sir Lancelot wishes to lessen the burden for his King, a wish that Guinevere also held. They conversed with each other and came to recognize each other as friends and rely on the other. It was then that Sir Lancelot became attracted to her. He learnt the King's secret from her. Though the king was actually a woman, she had married in order to maintain the pretense that she was a man and the image of a stable royal family. Guinevere, in turn, willingly sacrificed her own life as a woman in order to preserve this ideal government. When Lancelot and the queen began their affair, the Knight of the Lake considered fleeing Camelot with her, but his loyalty to Artoria and his sense of duty prevented him from doing so. When political enemies of the king learned about the affair, Agravain, who was working for Morgan le Fay, exposed the adulterous relationship to the public. The queen was ordered to be executed. Lancelot attempted to save her, killing several of his fellow knights including Gawain's siblings, Gareth and Gaheris, in the process. He fled back to his own domain. Lancelot, who was considered the perfect knight, Guinevere, the queen who had made her beloved betray his duty, and Artoria, the king who blamed herself for her loyal knight's despair, all suffered from the resulting fallout. Although Artoria forgave Lancelot's actions, Gawain still bore great hatred towards Lancelot for his betrayal and the death of his brothers. His disloyalty fractured the balance among the Knights of the Round Table. This incident eventually became the trigger of civil war and carnage, and the country shattered to pieces in the flames of war. Lancelot, even after being excommunicated, wanted to participate in the Battle of Camlann to serve his King but Gawain hostilely rejected him, which helped result\u00a0in the downfall of his King and country. When Lancelot heard the news of his King's death, Lancelot sank in despair and escaped through madness. Thus, when he became a Heroic Spirit, he was summoned as the insane Berserker.Appearance  Berserker is a robust man fully clad in pitch-black armor and a rustic helmet with a thinly carved slit displaying the ghastly glow of his eyes. The armor is the work of the delicate and nuanced workmanship of its smith's utmost effort, succeeding in granting it an air of formidability and a fine construction. It is a perfect armor that can be called neither exquisite nor crude, and it instead perfectly melds magnificence and functionality. It is carved with countless marks and scratches, the highlights of his various military exploits etched into it to add a touch of valor. It is an ideal battle outfit that all knights could not help but envy. During life, he was an ideal incarnation embodying the true face of a \"knight.\" Having lost his distinguished dignity of the past, he has been thoroughly changed by his descent into madness. Mad Enhancement and his anger have corroded him into his pitch-black form. He has a blackened face, the visage of a living dead man who has lost everything to a curse. He had a beautiful visage capable of drawing the admiration of many women, but his hatred has made him gaunt and pallid like a phantom. The only part of him filled with light is his eyes that are filled with hatred. He retains his normal appearance while not under the effects of Mad Enhancement. Due to For Someone's Glory, the identifying marks of his armor are hidden, only revealing the fact that he is fully clad in armor without any opening. It shows no ornaments or polished luster like that of Saber or Gilgamesh. Blurring the characteristic features and clues on the lineage of the maker, it makes him look like a \"shadow\", a bottomless black darkness like Hell. Once the ability is removed, the armor is easily identified as that of Lancelot. He lacks the radiance of Heroic Spirits, the \"shine\" that is the expression of their pride. There is no sign of the honor of his legend, the essential element of Noble Phantasms. This makes him closer to Assassin in nature, holding a \"negative surge\" like a vengeful spirit rather than a Heroic Spirit.Personality  \u201cI am the alienated, the ridiculed, the despised. No need to praise my name. No need to envy my body. I am the shadow under the radiance of heroic spirits. Birthed of the darkness of glorious legend. And so, I hate, I resent. Nourished by the sighs of the people precipitated within the darkness, people that curse the light. This is my disgrace. Because of her unsullied glory, I must forever be belittled. You are, the sacrifice. Good, give me more, your blood and flesh, your life. Let them ignite my hatred\u2014!!\u201d \u2014Berserker to Kariya As Berserker, his mind is under the effects of Mad Enhancement, limiting his rationality and ability to think. He gives off nothing but murderous intent and the thirst for blood, his deep hatred radiating out from him enough that he can easily be sensed even when he is hidden. He is able to battle with finesse due to his martial prowess, and he shows the ability to recognize that Lancer has been ordered to help him and take him as an ally for a short time. He still recognizes his King, instantly becoming hostile towards her and forgoing any orders in order to fight her. He growls parts of her name, a moan full of malice hardly resembling human speech. Lancelot was known to have extreme loyalty to his King during life as one of the people she considered to be a friend. She believes, even after their armies had clashed, that their hearts should still be the same, as a subject upholding the way of the knight and a king upholding the way of the knight. Saber is shocked in his ability to manifest as Berserker, that he who was the subject of people\u2019s admiration could be reduced to that state. She cannot help but think their eternal partnership was nothing but a naive fantasy onto which she had clung upon seeing him in that state. In one sense, he can be said to be a victim of Saber's righteousness. Saber believes the root of it to stem from her hiding her gender. Seeking punishment for his actions, he was forgiven by the one person who he desired it from the most. The wretchedness he felt from that simple act was overwhelming for him. His guilt weighed down on him the more he adored his king, so his only salvation became to personally bring about her downfall. The atrocities he committed were of an insane and irritable young man, but ultimately driven by his overwhelming love for his king. He hated that she could remain an ideal king even after learning about the affair, and lamented how his king sacrificed herself for the sake of her country.Role Fate/Zero  Berserker is summoned by Kariya Matou in the 4th Holy Grail War. Zouken Matou, deciding that Kariya was too lacking as a Mage, compensated by forcing him to obtain a Servant from the most powerful of the seven classes - namely the Servant of Mad Enhancement, Berserker. Until his identity was revealed, he was known simply as the Black Knight\u00a0(\u9ed2\u9a0e\u58eb, Kurokishi). During the War's first battle between the Servants, Lancer strikes Saber with G\u00e1e Buidhe and attempts to finish her off, but their fight is interrupted by Iskandar. In the ensuing chaos, both Archer and Berserker arrive and engage one another in battle. They are evenly matched, with weapons of Archer's Gate of Babylon being caught and effectively wielded by Berserker to deflect any other weapons thrown at him. Archer is forced by his Master to retreat, but Kariya, unable to control his Servant any longer, is unable to order Berserker to do the same. As a result, Berserker turns his attention to the injured Saber, but is stalled by Lancer's interference. However, Lancer's Master, Lord Kayneth Archibald El-Melloi, decides that Saber is the greater threat, and uses a Command Spell to coerce his Servant into aiding Berserker. This order is quickly retracted when Iskander interferes again, attacking Berserker from behind and threatening to team up with Saber. Both Berserker and Lancer retreat soon after. During the battle against Caster, Berserker takes control of an F-15 jet to use as his Noble Phantasm, and engages Archer in aerial combat at his Master's behest. Their fight is left unresolved when Berserker catches sight of Saber, and ignores Archer in favour of attacking the female Servant. He is defeated when Archer strikes him from behind with a barrage of Noble Phantasms. His Master, Kariya, is likewise defeated when he engages Tohsaka Tokiomi in combat. Berserker is next sent out to kidnap Irisviel von Einzbern, in order to fulfill Kariya's end of a bargain with Kirei Kotomine. He uses his abilities to assume Rider's form, effectively fooling Saber and her Master into pursuing the wrong Servant. Saber engages the true Rider in battle, allowing Berserker to safely deliver Irisviel to his Master. On the final day of the 4th Holy Grail War, Berserker engages Saber using submachine guns as his Noble Phantasm. (The anime depicts him with a Sniper Rifle and a Submachine Gun.) She manages to disarm him and damage his armour, but her killing blow is stopped short when Berserker deftly catches her blade between his hands. Saber realises that Berserker possesses knowledge of Excalibur's shape and length despite its invisibility, and deduces that he had known her when still alive. She demands that he reveal his true identity, to which Berserker responds by drawing his own sword, Arondight. His helmet finally shatters, revealing him to be Saber's old friend and greatest knight - Lancelot of the Lake. Overcome by guilt of how she had contributed to his downfall in life, Saber loses her will to fight, and is brutally battered by Lancelot. She blocks one final blow from Berserker, expecting the next to be a killing strike, only to have him completely cease all movement. At the instant of his last blow, Berserker's Master, Kariya, had been completely drained of magical energy, effectively cutting off Berserker's source of power. Taking advantage of the situation, Saber drives Excalibur into the frozen Berserker, dealing him a mortal wound. She tearfully tells him that she had wished to win the Holy Grail to atone for her past mistakes, including her part in Lancelot's death. Having regained his sanity, Berserker admits that he wished Saber had condemned him for his crimes, and demanded penance of him. Instead, her willingness to forgive him made it impossible for him to forgive himself. Berserker collapses into Saber's arms, sighing that, in the end, he would die in the bosom of his king, like a loyal and just knight. Unable to sustain his physical form any longer, Lancelot fades away and was the fifth servant to perish in the Fourth Grail War.  \u201cYou were the greatest amongst the kings. All who served you\u2026 believed thus.\u201d \u2014Lancelot last comments to Saber:Einzbern Consultation Room  Lancelot appears in Einzbern Consultation Room, a metafiction segment analyzing the story, taking place after his death. He appears as his normal self rather than under Mad Enhancement, shocking Irisviel and Student No.0's expectations of the Berserker-class Servant. He is humble and well-mannered, ashamedly standing outside hesitating to enter due to the deeds he committed. Throughout the episode, he makes several remarks about his past and the Grail War, as well as more personal opinions (the most notable of which being that he prefers Saber over Guinievere). He also reveals that, upon his summoning, he came into contact with the Great Grail's corruption and thus he became familiar with the nature of the Grail. Due to wishing for the Servants to be corrupted as a vessel for Angra Mainyu, Irisviel places a pot on his head to have him remember the darkness and slowly revert to Berserker. He tries to warn Student No.0 about Irisviel's true nature, but ends up reverting to Berserker and leaves in madness, only to be absorbed by the Grail.Garden of Avalon  Lancelot recounts his and Guinevere's betrayal.Capsule Servant  There are two Lancelot in the game: the Berserker Capsule Servant, and the Lancelot in the world of Capsule Servant who is the son of Gawain and the brother of Master Artoria, Kay and Bedivere.Fate/Grand Order Orleans: The Wicked Dragon Hundred Years' War  He is allied with Jeanne Alter and Gilles. Sanson and Lancelot are teamed up against Ritsuka Fujimaru, Mash Kyrielight, Mozart, Jeanne and Marie Antoinette. His attacks are blocked by Mash. When Berserk Assassin orders Sanson and Lancelot to retreat, he ignores the order and specifically targets Jeanne because he mistook Jeanne as King Arthur. When he is defeated, he calls out King Arthur and states he is pleased with this outcome.Salomon: The Grand Time Temple  Lancelot along with the other \"Orleans\" Singularity Servants and assist the Chaldea against Navelius.Interlude  In his first interlude Knight of Owner, Lancelot is brought to have a picnic with Ritsuka and Mash. Though Romani is concerned due to Lancelot being Berserker, Mash says they're fine as he is an understandable Berserker. However, further conversation is interrupted when a monster attacks the group, but Mash is unable to use her shield due to everyone's lunches being on it. So Lancelot blocks the monster's attack with chopsticks, then he uses a log to fight the monsters with Mash. In his second interlude For Someone's Glory, Lancelot joins Mash in a battle simulation (secretly at the highest parameters) as part of Romani's plan to remove his helmet. However, his combat skills overcome all of Romani's best efforts to get his helmet off. Frustrated by his failures Romani accidentally reveals aloud that everyone wanted to see Lancelot without his helmet. Complying with their request, Lancelot removes his helmet, but For Someone's Glory prevents them from seeing his face. Though they're disappointed, Ritsuka and Mash hope that Lancelot will one day reveal his face.Fate/Extella Link  Lancelot is a member of Karl der Gro\u00dfe's party.Other appearances  In Type-Moon's April Fools' Day 2009, moon.cinemas.jp is a fake movie theater site listing a number of parody films. He was featured in Tank Man\u00a0(\u6226\u8eca\u7537, Sensha Otoko), a parody film of Densha Otoko. Berserker plays the role of Sensha Otoko's Eirei Throne Channel internet friend with the nickname U to O\u00a0(\u30a6tu\u30aa, U tu o). He's a surprisingly nice guy but he is a man with a phobia of face to face and he uses his sketchbook to write his speech and thoughts. His role is expanded in TYPE-MOON 10th Anniversary Phantasm where he lives in the Matou family with Kariya and Sakura Matou. He and the other Eirei Throne Channel suggested Sensha Otoko to buy a Saber figure for El-Melloi Girl. When Kariya was stalking Aoi Tohsaka, Berserker calls him delusional and Kariya retaliate by throwing objects at Berserker. Kariya accidentally thrown an apple at Berserker's Saber Lily figure to which Berserker dived and saved it from falling. Berserker started to damage Kariya with his ability and they started to fight. In Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA\u2606ILLYA 3rei!!, Sakura installs Berserker Class Card. She was able to use Knight of Owner to steal Shirou's projected Noble Phantasm.Abilities  Berserker was born with numerous abilities and aptitudes that brought him to be famed as the strongest of the Knights of the Round Table. Rather than simply being \"high-spec\", he could be called \"completely overpowered\", displaying fighting prowess many times greater than even King Arthur and the ability to match Gawain until wounding him at nightfall. Due to his having often fell into madness in the incidents involving Guinevere, he has a great compatibility with the Berserker class. He is boosted by Mad Enhancement, giving him one rank in all stats besides Luck and Magical Energy. He loses the ability to speak and think complicatedly in exchange for the power, but still displays his great battle prowess. He has an extremely high rate of mana consumption as a Berserker, so it places great strain on Kariya to provide upkeep. While being of a normal class would have been better for Kariya, his increased parameters from being maddened are the only reason he is able to fight Gilgamesh as well as he manages. Constantly under the effects of Mad Enhancement, he is difficult to control in battle. While he will follow Kariya's general orders of targeting Gilgamesh, he will easily ignore them if he has another target he wishes to attack. Due to his connection with Saber, he immediately attacks her at any available point, and the only way to completely stop him is with a Command Spell. He uses a great deal of magical energy every time he acts, and combined with Kariya's fragile state of health, he brings his Master closer to death with each battle. He has low Magic Resistance granted by a ring amulet, but his madness drops the ability a rank. It can only somewhat reduce damage from magecraft instead of nullifying it. Protection of the Fairies grants him a blessing from the Elementals, the ability to call over luck in critical situations. Its activation is only limited to battlefields where it is possible to perform feats of arms. While his armor has many defining marks that easily show his identity, he remains unidentified due to the Noble Phantasm For Someone's Glory, a black fog that engulfs him to prevent others from discerning his identity by obscuring his figure and keeping enemy Masters from reading his abilities. The true nature of the ability would allow him to disguise himself as other Heroic Spirits, but the only way to use it as Berserker is to force him with a Command Spell.Combat  Berserker shows incredibly adept technical skills in battle despite his madness due to Eternal Arms Mastership, allowing him to put to use all of his skills in weaponry despite not being capable of fully rational thought. His mastery of the combat arts is at the level where he was unrivaled within his era. Due to the complete unification of mind, body, and technique, he displays flawless fighting skill even under the influence of any sort of mental hindrance. Though he attacks ferociously like a beast, befitting his class, all his attacks are accurate and precise enough to push even the strongest Servants back, and he can perform seemingly impossible maneuvers normally requiring complex thought purely on instinct, surprising onlookers due to his nature as a mad warrior. He mainly utilizes Knight of Owner in battle against other Servants for the duration of the Holy Grail War. He can make use of anything he classifies as a weapon, from telephone poles to the Noble Phantasms of others, as his own Noble Phantasm. He displays subtle and flawless technique, showing grandeur in using unfamiliar Noble Phantasms in repeated offensive and defensive maneuvers. Noble Phantasm are meant to be weapons for the exclusive usage of their owners, so another Heroic Spirit taking hold of one should not be able to wield it correctly. Knight of Owner allows him to easily wield Gilgamesh's weapons from the Gate of Babylon, and he is able to advance against his opponent without being forced back a single step or being damaged in any way. He is used to the full extent of Saber's abilities, so he is able to utilize accurate and prudent battle tactics. He hunts her by continually giving chase without allowing her to retaliate so as to slowly strangle her. He remembers her sword, allowing him to predict the path of it even while it is sheathed in Invisible Air. He knows every detail from its shape to its length like the back of his hand. He draws his main Noble Phantasm, Arondight, a sister sword of Excalibur, upon facing her. It allows him to unleash his true ability, showing skill with the sword completely incomparable to his previous level. While Saber is easily pushed back due to her having become unable to fight properly, even her being able to fight against him normally may not be able to withstand the strong momentum behind his strikes. It multiplies his magical energy upkeep many times, finally reaching the limit of Kariya's Crest Worms and taking several hours worth of backup magical energy in ten seconds from his last charge.Development  Lancelot first appearance in the illustration cover of Fate/stay night [Realta Nua] soundtrack. The scene with Berserker fighting Gilgamesh with a fighter jet was planned from the start, so Gen Urobuchi worked towards making it. He especially wanted an \"Itano Circus\", a unwieldy and unnecessarily large amount of missiles that will not even hit properly based on Ichiro Itano's work in Macross, from Gilgamesh's Gate of Babylon. The anime version has heavily revised the Berserker's flashback scenes. Gen Urobuchi explains that the sudden change from the battle to a flashback would make the audience lose tension from the inconsistent timeline. Tomonori Sudo (Supervising Key Animation Director) explains that they had the plan of \"there's a black haze\" with Berserker. He wanted to clearly show the haze that was hiding Berserker's real body. Naturally they thought of animating Berserker and then pasting the haze on top, but then the haze wouldn't look three dimensional. In the end, pictures are flat, so even if you paste the haze on top, it wouldn't have any depth. That being the case, he figured that if they applied the haze to the 3DCG, maybe they could get that sense of depth. So first they animated Berserker, then swapped out for 3DCG, and applied the haze to that. It was a fairly tedious process, but he thought it would be best to show Berserker.Masato Takizawa (Berserker 3DCG Supervisor) explains that he had to tweak parts like warping and altering the scale so Berserker's movements wouldn't look like stiff CG animation. Although there were a ton of difficult areas over the course of the series, he believe that all the hard work really can be seen on the screen and made for better visuals. He think that shows like this that are so beloved by the audience comes around once in a blue moon, so it is a real honor for him to be given the opportunity to take part in it. In episode 23 \"The Sea at the End of the World\", Berserker's movements are first drawn with keyframe animation, and then a 3DCG Berserker is animated to match, and finally, black mist is added over the top of that. After the mist clears, Berserker is fully animated using keyframe animation. Just like Kariya, the animation staff worked so hard they coughed up blood when they animated Berserker. Kei Tsunematsu was in charge of the storyboard for this episode.Creation and Conception  Berserker's armor was designed by Hirokazu Koyama. He was told to give Berserker the appearance of a dark hero with a \"bucket with a slit in it\" for the helmet. He gave him a massive outer appearance, and utilized various parts similar to Saber's armor to assemble it. Only the slit in the helmet remained from the original design order, and just from the outline of the head, it is a rather simple silhouette that still manages to carry the impression of the armor. Within the discarded designs, there was a period where the slit featured a more eye-like design. His original feel for the character was one of a great gap between his thin, weak looking appearance and amazing power and speed. The design of the back of the armor was added on afterwards, but fit in unexpectedly well. Takashi Takeuchi was surprised Koyama made such a complex design from the simple instruction of a \"Bucket Helmet\", and thought \"This sort of design must be pretty valuable.\" Gen Urobuchi also wondered how such a design would end up looking good, imagining a \"slit-like eyepiece\" like what was used in the final design. Takeuchi designed Lancelot's face easily, thinking \"This guy is so unlucky!\" while drawing him. The difference in his facial features between his living form and that under Mad Enhancement is like the difference between an ibis and an amoeba. The expression Lancelot makes next to Bedivere, like that of someone being punished for doing something wrong, makes Takeuchi tear up when looking at it. Urobuchi feels Lancelot is more beautiful as a handsome man with a shady past rather than an unrestrained playboy. Atsuhi Ikariya was in charge of the character design for the anime version. He drew Berserker like a mecha, so he used lots of shadows and lines and tried to give a sense of the metal of the armour. Ry\u014dtar\u014d Okiayu (Voice actor of Berserker) talks how it was surprisingly hard to pick out lines in the scripts as his lines were mostly just screaming \"Aaaah!\". When he was recording \"Sound Drama,\" he was told that the \"Aaaah!\" howl was him trying to shout \"Arthur\", but his hatred is so strong that he can't get the word out. He thinks it is hard to pick up on that when he first appears, but he made a point of going \"Aaaah!\" after they started the second season. He was really happy that he got to deliver some proper lines in the last two episodes. Nasu Kinoko is the scenario writer for his character.Reception  Okiayu said from a visual standpoint, the staff of Ufotable has really pulled out all stops on Berserker. When he heard that they could only finish a handful of cuts in a day, he was shocked at the craftsmanship. Since the visuals weren't done when he was recording, he only did growls and howls for timing. Okiayu said that a lot of people didn't know that he was playing Berserker in the first season because he's always howling. Shingaki Tarusuke (Voice actor of Kariya Matou) stated that every scene featured Berserker is a classic scene.References Japanese  \u30d0\u30fc\u30b5\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u7d44\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066Unlimited Blade Works  Unlimited Blade Works: Infinite Creation of Swords\u00a0(, , localized as \"Universe of Endless Blades\") is the Reality Marble of Shirou Emiya and the Noble Phantasm of the Heroic Spirit EMIYA and his Fate/Extra counterpart. EMIYA does not have a true Noble Phantasm that is the crystallized embodiment of a hero's existence like many demonic or holy swords, but if a Noble Phantasm is considered to be a symbol of the Heroic Spirit, then the Reality Marble is his Noble Phantasm. It is a high-class thaumaturgy that embodies their internal worlds and imprints them upon the World as a Bounded Field for a short amount of time. It is their one true specialization of magecraft, the result of \"Sword\" being both their Origin and their Elemental Affinity, and the basis of their projection and reinforcement skills. It is the definite answer obtained by someone whose life was saved by a sword, actually merged and lived with a sword, and acted as a sword all of his life. A magus who specialized in forging swords over one's entire lifetime while struggling to arrive at this one land very far to them. Shirou Emiya has no penalties from the World while utilizing his version of Unlimited Blade Works.Invocation  Both Archer and Shirou use an incantation to facilitate the invocation of the Reality Marble. It is close to a \"Ten-Count\" aria, using a poem about the caster as the basis, a sorrowful elegy in EMIYA's case, used to activate High-Thaumaturgy. Shirou describes it as a suggestion to change himself and the words that will \"connect Shirou Emiya\". Their chants differ slightly due to the different experiences in their respective lives. The lines of the incantation can be said at any time without requiring preparation, and Archer is able to stop between lines to speak and then resume without issue. The first line is often used in order to strengthen a projection, such as with Archer's use of Caladbolg II and Shirou's use of Rho Aias. Once the incantations have been completed, an illusionary fire that does not emit any heat spreads out to form a boundary and wall for the Bounded Field. The bright light fills the vision of those present, and manifests an open, barren desert with monolithic black gears gyrating in the distance. It is a kingdom of rubble littered with thousands, perhaps a countless number, of swords anchored in the ground like grave markers in a wasteland, yet are well preserved. It is a world likened to a steel mill, filled with weapons, flames, and giant gears. The basis for the world in the Reality Marble is a hill of swords that spreads infinitely in their minds. It is the final illusion Archer saw on the verge of death, the only pride left within himself, and it is where Shirou makes his vow to uphold his ideals during the Unlimited Blade Works route. The reflection of this inner world depends on their state of mind and their experiences in life, which means that they are completely different and incompatible with each other. Archer's is formed from the basis of having been betrayed by everything, including by his own ideals, and in the end having only been granted this one single spell. Shirou is able to realize his version upon deciding that his ideals and dreams, while borrowed, flawed, and hypocritical, are still worth striving for and upholding. Shirou's version is bathed in twilight from the extended horizon, while Archer's version has its view opaqued by a thick haze formed from embers and wisps of black smog rising from the ground, produced by the forging of iron. If their perspectives are to interact, such as when Shirou obtains Archer's arm, he is able to utilize the recorded knowledge of stored weapons, but is unable to actualize the Reality Marble due to the difference in their internal worlds. The version of Miyu's brother is a dark winter scenery with blowing snow; the reflection of this inner world symbolizes how Shirou chooses to disregard himself and the lives of others for a single person's happiness.Usage  The Reality Marble's purpose is a steel manufacturing factory that produces the countless famous swords that are without their owners, extending into the horizon. It contains all of the raw materials and sorcery needed for the formation of the weapons, and it records and analyzes all weapons and defensive armaments encountered by the user. The number of unique weapons encountered and recorded by Archer exceeds numerous thousands, most of which are Noble Phantasms each possessing deadly powers. Their entire histories, compositions, and designs are all perfectly recorded, allowing for instant proficiency with the weapons by inheriting all combat skills and techniques utilized by their original owners. This allows for the reproduction of Noble Phantasms, which would generally be impossible for a faker. They can also be modified to the user's taste with reinforcement as shown by Archer's Caladbolg II and Kanshou and Bakuya. During his lifetime, EMIYA would customize his weapons from their usual states, projecting Noble Phantasms that appears to have been arranged with designs that are easier to use. Close combat weapons such as swords, spears, and halberds are the main focus of the Reality Marble in accordance with Shirou's Origin of \"Sword\", which also makes it impossible to record or reproduce modern weaponry like guns and other mobile weapons. Shields and defensive armaments can be reproduced with a much greater struggle as the cost in magical energy is high, two or three times greater than a sword, and the effects are merely transient compared to the originals. Weapons encountered are immediately analyzed with a single glance, enabling them to be projected immediately afterwards, and once projected, they are stored within the Reality Marble for later use. Shirou is able to instantly recognize dozens of weapons being fired from the Gate of Babylon at an extremely high rate and instantly counter with projections of the same weapons before they can strike. The analysis of weapons is limited only to the direct use of human senses, meaning that blueprints and materials will be unable to provide the necessary information for a proper analysis. Shared memories, such as dreams shared with a Servant, can allow for weapons to be analyzed and projected, even if they have been lost like Caliburn. The quality of projected weapons will always be degraded by one rank due to humans being unable to fully conceptualize the existence of an object through only one sense, and they will never equal the originals without a technique such as detonating them as Broken Phantasms. The one exception for Shirou is Avalon, which can be projected perfectly due to having been fused with him for many years. Archer of Fate/Extra, under the conditions of the Moon Cell, is noted to be able to project objects with no inherent rankability (EX Rank Noble Phantasms) should he have support from the original owner. Without being deployed, the Reality Marble allows for projection and reinforcement in the real world. Weapons are produced within Unlimited Blade Works and then brought into the world, greatly lowering the cost of reproducing them and allowing for numerous weapons to be prepared at once to be projected. Weapons can be summoned directly to the user's hands, or they can be summoned to levitate within the air and fire upon the enemy as arrows much like the Gate of Babylon. Once the Reality Marble is deployed, all of the weapons are available for use without the need to project them from scratch as they are physically there in the Reality Marble, and any weapon can immediately be called to the user's hands, pulled from out of the ground, or levitated even while the user is in direct combat. The weapons reproduced once the Reality Marble is first activated will not consume magical energy, but those used or destroyed within it will add to the cost of maintaining the Bounded Field. The amount of energy used to reproduce weapons that did not exist after the Bounded Field was expanded and the amount of energy used to recreate weapons destroyed while it is activated is extremely costly. EMIYA and Shirou have access to a large number of Noble Phantasms that they have encountered during their lifetimes, which include Caladbolg II, Durandal, Hrunting, Kanshou and Bakuya, Rho Aias, and numerous weapons from the Gate of Babylon. Divine Constructs, such as Ea and Excalibur, are unable to be replicated, though there may be degraded Noble Phantasms with similar abilities stored within the Reality Marble. Archer claims that it is possible to reproduce an imperfect version of Excalibur likely to drain him of all of his magical energy in a suicide attack. Shirou using Archer's arm in the Heaven's Feel route states that he would be able to project it if Saber Alter were to give him time, but believes that he cannot handle the sword and that the difficulty of doing such a high level projection in battle would make it impractical. Shirou, during Heaven's Feel, requires a weapon to destroy the Greater Grail and uses his image of \"The greatest Noble Phantasm I know of.\" The image in his head is that of Excalibur, and the weapon utilizes a large beam of light as an attack at the cost of his life during the normal ending. The conditions for where wrought iron is possible are enhanced within the Moon Cell, removing the limitation and allowing for the projection of holy sword-class weaponry. Their performance is still inferior to the actual weapons, limiting Archer of Fate/Extra to projecting a degraded version of Excalibur, Excalibur Image. Characters in the world of Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA\u2606ILLYA show some ability to replicate Divine Constructs through special means. The Reality Marble is a natural counter to Gilgamesh, allowing Shirou, a below average magus, to completely overwhelm and defeat him. Though Shirou would be no match against other Servants who have mastered their own weapons to the utmost limit, Unlimited Blade Works being a somewhat troublesome ability to them, the fact that both he and Gilgamesh are \"owners\" of numerous weapons places them on a level playing field. Neither has a specialized weapon with which they can be called a \"wielder\", so Shirou's ability to counter each and every weapon fired by the Gate of Babylon places Gilgamesh at a disadvantage. Outside of the Reality Marble, Shirou is barely able to keep up with Gilgamesh's assault while he was simply playing around with Shirou. Once within the confines of the Reality Marble, all of his weapons are produced and ready to attack, which means that the Gate of Babylon's slightly slower summoning rate allows Shirou to hone in on Gilgamesh to fight and defeat him at close range. He is unable to handle Shirou's attacks, which forces him to allow his own weapons to be destroyed in order to counter Shirou's projections, and Shirou even has time to instantly recognize Ea as Gilgamesh is drawing it and quickly chop off his arm before he can utilize it. Even with the advantages, he claims that Gilgamesh would win if he were to have time to regain his composure.Outside Effects  The Reality Marble is able to invade Shirou's body in the form of numerous blades during severe trauma to heal and overwrite wounds. It changes the nature of the regeneration provided by Avalon into an indirect form that \u201cchanges his muscles into blades in order to knit his wounds with swords.\u201d It replaces and reinforces broken bones and muscles with swords after he is wounded, allowing him to survive a blow to the chest from Rider's dagger. It also allows him to survive a kick from her that would normally gouge out his stomach. When she realizes his innards are too durable to fatally wound him, she kicks him out of a window to kill him instead, and the ability goes out of control after he hits the ground during the \"Rafflesia Umbrella\" bad ending where blades burst from his chest and cause a fatal wound. The ability manages to keep him from having his entire body destroyed from an attack by Gilgamesh, and makes him appear to have \"masses of blades shaped like muscle fibers\" as he heals. He is completely invaded by Archer's Unlimited Blade Works after taking his arm during Heaven's Feel. The more he uses the abilities from the arm, the harder it becomes for him to suppress the Reality Marble. It will create an infinite number of blades inside his body rather than outside, causing a thousand blade to eventually pierce and kill him instantly if he lets it go fully out of control. The arm eventually begins to start permanently replacing parts of his breaking-down body with blades as it frantically tries to keep him alive due to him overusing its abilities. His joints gradually become harder to move properly as they begin to take on a metallic, grating sound when he moves, and hundreds of blades protrude from numerous areas on his skin as they prepare an inescapable death by skewering. He comments that \"I am the bone of my sword\" when thinking over that fact. During his\u00a0duel to the death\u00a0against Kirei Kotomine, it makes the latter unable to strike Shirou without also hurting himself on the blades, and it increases Shirou's durability so that only a fatal strike to his head will kill him. Before his body completely gives out, he states that even his senses are turning into steel as well.References Kiritsugu Emiya  Kiritsugu Emiya\u00a0(\u885b\u5bae \u5207\u55e3, Emiya Kiritsugu) is the Master of Saber in the Fourth Holy Grail War of Fate/Zero. He is the husband of Irisviel von Einzbern, the father of Illyasviel von Einzbern, and the adoptive father of Shirou Emiya. He is the main protagonist of Fate/Zero and has a minor role in Fate/stay night. He was a freelancer and notoriously known as the Magus Killer\u00a0(\u9b54\u8853\u5e2b\u6bba\u3057, Majutsushi-goroshi).Profile Background  Due to his father, Norikata Emiya, fourth family head of the Emiya family and a magus who received a Sealing Designation, Kiritsugu lost his mother shortly after he was born. Father and son were on the run from the Mage's Association, and thus Kiritsugu spent his youth wandering around the world with his father.Early years  They settled on Alimango Island for a year. He became friends with - and had a crush on - Noritaka's assistant, a local girl called Shirley who was four years older than him. However, disaster struck when Shirley became a vampire after she drank a potion, intending for it to prove that Noritaka's research would save the world. She pled for Kiritsugu to kill her, but he refused and fled. Their village was overrun by Executors from the Church and Enforcers from the Association, both groups having arrived when they heard rumors of a magus researching into vampirism. Kiritsugu was the only survivor of the 'cleansing', saved by Natalia Kaminski, a freelancer and part-time Enforcer who wanted information on the magus responsible. Returning to the hidden Emiya residence, Kiritsugu confronted his father on his research and Shirley's death. Norikata explained that he wanted to become a Dead Apostle to continue with his research on Magecraft longer. In the Fate/Zero novel version, just as Noritaka was planning their escape, Kiritsugu shot him in the back with a pistol; in the animated version Kiritsugu stabs Norikata with the dagger Kiritsugu received from Shirley and then shot his father, who was highly shocked at his son's betrayal, to death with a pistol that Kiritsugu found in Norikata's drawer. To this end, Natalia figured that the only person who could prevent Noritaka from escaping and ensure his death was his own son and she wound up taking Kiritsugu with her.Magus Killer  Realizing that the tragedies he saw in his childhood were common occurrences in the world, the teenage Kiritsugu became a freelancer like Natalia to hunt down heretical magi around the world. Natalia trained him not only in Magecraft, but in tracking, assassination, and all types of weaponry. At first, he only got in Natalia's way, but he eventually became her partner and equal. During one mission together, they were hunting down the last Zepter head Heinrich Zepter, who was a magus who mastered the revival of dead flesh. After tracking Zepter to an American village called \"Present Mountain\", Kiritsugu and Natalia discovered all two thousand members of the community were extensions of Zepter's body. They wound up destroying by throwing a hand grenade into the core of his body. During the last mission together, Natalia was positioned aboard an Airbus A300 jumbo jet in flight in order to track a magus known as the \u201cDemonic Bee User\u201d, Odd Borzak. It was said that this magus successfully created Dead Apostles and could manipulate the Demonic Ghoul Bees under his control to use poisonous stings to increase the amount of Ghouls under his power. The Ghoul Bees caused a fatal disturbance in the plane after the death of Borzak, and began to infect all the passengers one by one until every single passenger had become a Ghoul. Kiritsugu, who was stationed at the plane's destination, elected to shoot down the plane after he deemed the situation too risky to allow the plane to land, sacrificing Natalia in the process. In their last conversation via radio, he admitted that she was like a mother to him. It was then that he became disillusioned with his ideal of becoming a 'hero of justice', as it was impossible to save one person without losing another. However, he continued to fight for this dream, to ensure that everything he had given up would not be in vain. He was eventually branded as the Magus Killer by the Association.Before Fourth Grail War  Around eleven years before the fourth Holy Grail War, he took on a younger soldier as his apprentice, who he eventually named Maiya Hisau, training her in much the same way Natalia trained him. She became his assistant in the field and also his 'lover', in a purely sexual context. Two years later, Kiritsugu was hired by the Einzbern family to be their representative in the coming conflict. He entrusted all his equipment, including his Thompson Contender, to Maiya before leaving. Believing that the Holy Grail could grant his dream for world peace, he left behind his work as a 'hero of justice'. He first met Irisviel von Einzbern in a tank when Justacheit von Einzbern made her. The Drama CD expands on how they met and their initial reaction. Kiritsugu questioned Acht as he viewed Irisviel as useless with no survival skills or defense abilities. Acht took this personally and threw away Irisviel in the disposal yard during a blizzard as a test to determine her durability. Kiritsugu, disgusted, rushed to save Irisviel and took her back to the old von Einzbern castle. When she recovered, Kiritsugu decided to educate Irisviel about the current world with movies, pictures and music. Gradually Irisviel became more eloquent and expressive, and she became interested in Kiritsugu himself. Despite Kiritsugu's initial hesitation, they eventually fell in love. However, Kiritsugu knew that a love between the two would be fruitless, as he was aware that he would sacrifice her for the Holy Grail. For Kiritsugu's sake, Irisviel wanted to conceive a child so her husband would have hope after the Fourth Grail War. He was asked to marry into the Einzbern family.Appearance  He wears a black suit and trench coat. His face is blank and his eyes are vacant. As a boy, his shining eyes and tanned skin make him look cheerful.Personality  In his youth, Kiritsugu wished to be a Hero of Justice and protect the weak. He is often haunted by Shirley's question about what he wants to become, and how she believed him to have the ability to change the world. His hesitation to kill his first love when she became a Dead Apostle resulted in the death of the whole Island. Kiritsugu, realizing that his father was the cause of this and he would continue his Dead Apostle experiment, hardened his resolve and killed his father to prevent more deaths. Kiritsugu then resolved to make meaning and worth from the murder of his father. Only by hunting and assassinating all heretic magi like his father could he truly prevent such tragedies from occurring again. He lost all traces of youthful innocence after having spent his life going through countless battles while trying to obtain a utopia that could never be fulfilled. After finding out about the existence of the Grail, he sought to use it to obtain that utopia. He feels no emotion from personal victories over his targets, seeing them as nothing more than successful taunts with calculated resolutions. In order to pursue his dream, he attempts to distance himself from his emotions, acting as the \"machine that is Emiya Kiritsugu.\" He has managed to become completely devoted to any duty without showing any emotional wavering, though he is prone to occasionally fall into moments of extreme emotion and despair. When he admits that he is afraid and terrified of Kirei Kotomine, it is partly because of Kirei's bizarre personality, but also because of the fact that he fears that Kirei might be the one and only person who can kill him. When examining the Contender, he begins to wonder if he will remember the touch of his wife and daughter after the Grail War ends, and falls into self-derision upon realizing the eight year old Ilya weighs less than a rifle. He dislikes such emotions interfering with his work, believing that his interactions with his family have made him more susceptible to sentimentalism in viewing the figures of his own wife and daughter in a passing mother holding her crying child. Kiritsugu tries to hold to the belief that there is no differentiation in sacrifice, that all life is equal and choosing the path leading to a smaller sacrifice is for the best. With a target that must be eliminated in order to save the world by obtaining the Grail, killing one thousand people to save at least five billion more should be easy for him. He finds himself unable to do so when planning to destroy the Hyatt hotel. He hates the idea of fatal romanticism like the hope that the innocent tenants will be able to escape the hotel in time impeding his abilities. Such ideas and sentiment would kill him on the battlefield, so he feels that he must rid him self of them as much as possible. He has a close connection to Maiya that is older than the one with Irisviel, sharing a blood-stained existence not even his wife has ever seen. She acts to help balance his emotions, as she is often even more emotionless than him. Despite being close and having had a sexual relationship for a long duration of time, he shares no romantic feelings for her and attempts to simply regard her as a tool that will eventually die to serve her purpose. Because allowing his wife to sacrifice herself to complete the Grail is a betrayal towards her love, no matter what others say, it is necessary that he does not hesitate in this betrayal. Kiritsugu sees his sexual relationship with Maiya as a rehearsal before this betrayal, a form of self-abuse to steel his nerves while walking down this path. During the last moments of Maiya's life, he attempts to calmly tell her that she has nothing to worry about because her tasks are complete, and simply states \"you will die here.\" He finds himself unable to speak, and instead he almost finds himself crying for her. She eventually reminds him of his purpose and tells him to save his tears for Irisviel, allowing him to finally say, \"Maiya, your task is complete.\" He stopped smoking while with the Einzbern family, but takes it up again during the Grail War. Partly because he could not find his favorite brand, but mostly out of consideration for his wife and child. He instantly buys a pack out of habit and once again begins smoking as if hadn\u2019t been ten years. Being a Japanese native, he feels better while in the country despite being used to travel. After rescuing Shirou, he found salvation in his despair. Before his death, he found a glimmer of hope as Shirou inherited his ideals and he believed Shirou to achieve this. He once told a young Shirou that \"boys who make a girl cry will end in ruins\", something he experienced prior to his death. Overall, while Kiritsugu is a ruthless, calculating, stoic, emotionless, brooding, and cold-blooded killer who has committed some villainous acts \u00a0to achieve his goals, he is\u00a0idealistic and has good intentions which makes him mostly an anti-hero.Role Fate/Zero  Despite being the true Master for Einzbern family, Kiritsugu operated mostly in the background during the conflict, ambushing other Masters when they were otherwise occupied, while Saber, who was summoned using Excalibur's lost sheath as a catalyst, was partnered with Irisviel and made to act out in the open. This was to avoid conflict between Kiritsugu and Saber, as the methodologies of the two conflicted with each other too much. Saber and Irisviel traveled from Einzbern's castle in northern Europe to Japan by plane, while Kiritsugu took a different route, entering Fuyuki by ship and meeting with Maiya. In the climax of the war, Kiritsugu fought the last Master, Kirei Kotomine to a standstill, both being consumed by the black 'mud' flowing out from the Holy Grail. There, Kiritsugu met 'Irisviel' again, now completely merged with the Grail. In his mind, he was forced to confront the fact that his methods will eventually lead to him becoming the ultimate enemy of humanity, equal to Angra Mainyu itself - and, 'Irisviel' proclaimed, this path is correct. Kiritsugu, rejected the Grail's argument saying that he sought the Grail because his own methods are insufficient to bring about the utopia he sought, only to have the Grail argue further that it cannot grant a wish without a methodology to realizing it. In other words, the Grail only sought to grant his wish by doing what he has always done in his stead. Now realizing that the Grail was corrupted and false, Kiritsugu rejected 'Irisviel', who placed a curse on him - to never be free of regret until his painful death. Kirei, having gone through the same experience, asked Kiritsugu why he rejected the Grail; Kiritsugu killed him after a vague response. Kiritsugu appeared during the final battle between Archer and Saber and, without explaining what he just found, used all his remaining command seals to force Saber to destroy the Grail with Excalibur, causing her to fade away. However, Kiritsugu realized immediately after that this was a mistake - by leaving the Greater Grail intact, 'mud' from its core was able to spill onto the streets below, causing a fire that eventually destroyed a large part of Shinto. With the war's end, Kiritsugu discarded his merciless facade and sought to atone for his gruesome deeds. When he stumbled upon a dying Shirou, seemingly the only survivor after the fire, he was overjoyed at the opportunity to save a life. In order to revive him, Kiritsugu implanted Avalon into Shirou's body. Kiritsugu later adopted him as a son, settling in the new Emiya residence that he purchased during the war. He met Taiga Fujimura sometime after, and due to her resemblance to his first love, Shirley, he doted on her a great deal. Once Shirou was old enough, Kiritsugu left Fuyuki several times, traveling back to the old von Einzbern castle, trying to see his daughter. However, he never managed to find his way past the bounded fields, having lost most of his magecraft abilities. After his betrayal, rather than seeking to punish him, Jubstacheit von Einzbern never again allows Kiritsugu into their Bounded Field and keeps him away from his daughter, who is raised by Acht under the impression that she was abandoned by her father. Kiritsugu believes that Acht either wishes to exile him to carry the deplorable status of traitor for the rest of his life, or to impose the most severe punishment that can be inflicted by never allowing him to see his daughter again. To ensure the destruction of the Great Grail, Kiritsugu used explosives to create a 'bump' in the nearby leyline, which would ensure an earthquake in thirty to forty years' time. By doing so he hoped to prevent a fifth war, but did not realize that the incomplete ending of the fourth war would cause the next war to occur in just ten years. In the Drama CD, Kiritsugu was awake late at night and Shirou woke up after experiencing nightmares from fire. Shirou would take the medicine that Kiritsugu made with magecraft. Shirou asks Kiritsugu about teaching him magecraft but Kiritsugu was completely against it. The next day, he sparred with Taiga in kendo and complimenting her for her skills. Kiritsugu asked for Taiga's advice and her answer helped his decision about teaching magecraft to Shirou. Angra Mainyu's curse eventually cost his life, as his limbs were lame, his sight failed, and most of his circuits became useless. His last moments were with Shirou, watching the moon outside his garden. It would be his happiest memory, during which he reminisced on his life, noting that it was full of regrets especially his inability to save his daughter. Revealing his childhood dream to Shirou about becoming a 'hero of Justice', Kiritsugu admitted that the dream was impossible to accomplish as he became an adult. Shirou, who looked up to Kiritsugu, hated the way he spoke of his weakness and reassured Kiritsugu that he can accomplish it as he was still a child in Kiritsugu's place. He died peacefully as he vaguely stared at the moon and commented how beautiful it is. He died at the age of thirty-four, five years after the end of the War, passing onto Shirou his ideal of a 'hero of justice'. In his last thoughts, he recalled when Shirley asked what kind of adult he wants to become and he had said: \u201cI'll never forget what I felt today. I want to be a hero of justice!\u201d\n \u2014Kiritsugu EmiyaFate/stay night  Although he died before Fate/stay night, he is referenced by many characters. He is buried in the graveyard behind Ryuudou Temple, though Shirou rarely visits. His death left Shirou frustrated, depressed, and alone. Shirou frequently recalls how Kiritsugu saved him and how Kiritsugu had offered to adopt him, along with revealing that he was a magus. When Shirou expressed interest in learning Magecraft, Kiritsugu disapproved and initially refused until Shirou's persistence wore him down. Advising that Magecraft should only be used in secret and to the benefit of others, without attracting suspicion or confusion, he taught Shirou very basic and incomplete knowledge of sorcery. However, this knowledge would lead him down a dangerous path with little results. Before dying, Kiritsugu had revealed to Shirou how he once strove to become a \"Hero of Justice\" - a person who could save everyone - but gave up once he realized it was impossible, citing it was a dream that could not be achieved by an adult. However, Shirou took the ideal as his own, promising to accomplish it in Kiritsugu's stead. Archer generally disapproves of the ideal; in the Unlimited Blade Works scenario, it is revealed that Archer is a possible future incarnation of Shirou where he regretted the path he took. Archer's memories are incomplete, but he remembers certain events, one of the important events he remembered being when Kiritsugu saved his life after the fire. He understood Kiritsugu's last words and experienced the same suffering that Kiritsugu had. In his duel against Shirou, he claims that his ideals are borrowed and he simply admired Kiritsugu because he saved him. During the Fifth Holy Grail War, in the Fate and Heaven's Feel scenarios, Shirou discovers that his father was a master of the Fourth Grail War, and Saber's original master. In both routes, Saber revealed to Shirou that Kiritsugu was her Master in the Fourth Grail War. Furthermore, she is stunned into disbelief when she observes how Kiritsugu was an entirely different person in Shirou's memories. In the Fate scenario, she wants to know why Kiritsugu betrayed her until Kirei Kotomine reveals that the Grail was tainted. Finally understanding why Kiritsugu destroyed the Grail, she eventually accepts and agrees with her former Master's actions. Saber also expresses gratitude toward Kiritsugu for implanting Avalon in Shirou, which saved his life on many occasions, first when Berserker attacked Shirou and when Kirei heavily injured him. In the Heaven's Feel scenario, she discovers why Kiritsugu betrayed her after being corrupted by the ichor of the Grail. Upon her entry into the war, Illyasviel von Einzbern specifically targets Shirou because of his connection to Kiritsugu. Believing that Shirou had stolen her father and that Kiritsugu had abandoned her mother to die in the Fourth Grail War, she attempts to fulfill the Einzbern's desire to revive the Third Magic and avenge their defeat after Kiritsugu's betrayal. In the Heaven's Feel scenario, after being kidnapped by Dark Sakura and informed about Avenger and the corruption of the Holy Grail, she admits that Kiritsugu was correct in his decision to destroy the Grail. When Kotomine first meets Shirou, his interest is piqued because Shirou shares the same surname as Kiritsugu. In the Fate and Heaven's Feel routes, he revealed everything about his deeds during the Fourth Grail War. In the former scenario, Kotomine used the power of Angra Mainyu to curse Shirou just like Kiritsugu.Fate/tiger colosseum series  Kiritsugu is a playable character in Fate/tiger colosseum Upper but he makes his first appearance in Kirei's ending.Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA\u2606ILLYA  .Other appearances  Kiritsugu makes no appearances in Fate/hollow ataraxia, though it is common knowledge that Illyasviel is Kiritsugu's daughter. Taiga often requests that Shirou take her to visit Kiritsugu's grave. He has a brief appearance in Carnival Phantasm, celebrating with his family Irisviel and Illya in Ahnenerbe at the end of the carnival. He does not appear in Capsule Servant game. He kidnapped Irisviel from the Einzbern and married her, he adopted Shirou during in his business trip. In the events of Capsule Servant, he is on an overseas business trip with Irisviel. Kiritsugu appears in the 6th episode of Today's Menu for Emiya Family, a flashback episode which details the first time Shirou cooked hamburgers for him. He also makes an appearance in one chapter of All Around Type-Moon in which he encounters his former Servant Saber, yet he fails to recognize her. At one point, he brushes past Archer when leaving. Archer is surprised, but is happy to be able to see his father one last time.Abilities  Kiritsugu, due to the lack of devoted magecraft training under his father or Natalia, is only average as a magus, and instead specializes as a \"Magus Killer.\" He has a number of specialties that would not make him very notable within the Mage's Association, but instead make him useful for higher-ups when they need an assassin to kill other heretical magi. Compared to someone like Rin Tohsaka, who would have a high numerical value as a magus, Kiritsugu would have a low value as a magus, but a much higher evaluation as a specialist. His relationship with the Association is much like how the Church treats its Executors. His abilities are great enough that even the Church considers him to be \"an individual that requires surveillance.\" He is noted for many cases of missing persons and accidents believed to be magi he has killed, and many tragedies of the past reported as major acts of terrorism are in reality criminal acts committed for the sake of killing one magus. While there is no actual evidence, events such as planting a bomb in public and striking down an airplane with many passengers on board are believed to be caused by him. After becoming cursed by Angra Mainyu, he slowly deteriorates over a number of years as his flesh keeps growing weaker, his limbs become atrophied, and he completely loses the ability to use magecraft. He becomes unable to even find the starting point of the Bounded Field of the Einzbern Castle, while the \u201cMagus Killer\u201d would have been able to forcibly break through, he is left to wander in a blizzard without any hope of finding it. Once he fully succumbs to the curse, he dies peacefully.Combat tactics  Kiritsugu is a very unconventional magus, known as a Spellcaster, that treats magecraft as a mere tool in which he has acquired knowledge rather than the object of his lifelong goals, and he primarily prefers the use of modern technology supplemented with any little magecraft abilities he has to gain an advantage over enemies. Compared to someone like Tokiomi Tohsaka, who refuses to use phones and the like despite their convenience, he freely uses anything at his disposal in order to accomplish his goals. He learned most of his skills from studying Natalia's abilities while also refining his own as her assistant in his pursuit to become a \"hunter\" that stops other heretical magi like his father. Much of his ability comes from the fact that he can act cold and ruthless to complete his objectives. After having spent time in retirement with his wife and daughter, he believes he has degraded a great deal compared to the Emiya Kiritsugu from nine years before. He is no longer as willing or capable of being as ruthless as he once was due to his interactions with them, which he believes he needs to change. He wishes to restore his cold manner of judgement as fast as possible in order to be able to obtain the Grail. He developed his skills working as a Sealing Designation Enforcer for a number of years, learning methods of tracking, assassination, the usage of various weapons, and other skills needed to be able to catch up to his prey under all situations and conditions and bring it down. He sought to have his body master the skill of \"killing people\" that humans have spent an endless amount of time and intelligence to research. He is very skilled with using numerous blasting techniques from the past to the present, and he feels a certain appreciation for the certain art of destruction. He uses C4 combined with a precision blasting demolition technique used primarily to demolish tall buildings, allowing him to destroy the Hyatt hotel with a minimum amount of explosives. With the blueprints and planning, it only takes him an hour execute the entire plan. Targeting the load-bearing walls and key support structures, it collapses downward and inward on its own weight without much debris spilling onto the surrounding streets and causing unnecessary collateral damage. He is very familiar with the workings of Magic Circuits and the related temperature changes in the body of the practitioner. Having trained and studied the correlation, he is able to read the current status of the Magic Circuits through the heat distribution of the practitioner when viewed on the thermal output of a heat detecting scope. He is able to tell the difference between an ordinary person and a magus, allowing him to seize an opportunity to shoot upon the release of magical energy. Compared to magecraft, which can see through the dark better and detect the position of an enemy magus, it can be said guns fall behind. Its advantage is that it takes no magical energy to use firearms, leaving a magus unsuited to the battle conditions of a soldier trapped in the dark and unable to detect any magical energy. He is extremely skilled in penetrating Bounded Fields, allowing him to break through the Tohsaka residence's strong bounded field in three hours. It is an almost miraculous method allowing him to overcome a first-rate security system specifically guarding against magi that wouldn't be broken even if attacked continuously for a whole year by magecraft. Due to it being created with magi in mind, he was able to overcome it precisely because he is someone who does not seek results by way of magecraft and from his experience in fighting against magi by perceiving traps wrought through magecraft. He supplements familiars with miniature CCD camera tied on the abdomen as a measure of recording the true nature of the area. There are often illusions and camouflaged bounded fields based on using suggestions on an observer, but most magi would never develop countermeasures for electronic-based threats. Even though it slows the familiar's speed, it is also useful to have video records to rewatch events at a later time or show them to others.Anti-magi tactics  Kiritsugu has the mindset of a skilled assassin, and rather than facing another magus in a direct duel of abilities, such as in a battle between their Mystic Code's; he makes use of various plans, traps, and schemes that utilize both magecraft and modern weaponry in order to take out his targets. He preys on the weak point of magi, their negligence derived from arrogance; which makes them believe that the only true threat to them cannot be anything other than a magus of similar skill. He relies on the fact that a self-conscious magus, having stepped into a world of mysteries beyond human intellect, is unable to relate to the stereotypes of a narrower world; such as the conditions of a battlefield or scenarios, the type a regular soldier may face. He follows the methodology that the attack the enemy does not expect is a shortcut for all battles; and preys on the fact that they constantly stay on alert to the slightest trace of magecraft. Magi generally only hone their skills, counter measures towards thaumaturgical threats; ignoring any attack that is purely physical, and void of magecraft. They view the sharpest knives and strongest bullets as secondary menaces they have no need to fear. Before such an attack actually pierces their flesh, they are confident in their illusions, paralysis methods; and defensive bounded fields being more than capable to negate such attacks. They despise technology and underestimate what a human without magecraft can accomplish, which makes them weak to non-magical attacks from Kiritsugu. Though most magi would take the idea of entering the lair of another magus as a challenge, Kiritsugu takes an opposite approach. When faced with the Hyatt hotel; Kayneth's stronghold, which has been fortified with magical furnaces, spirits and apparitions, and a large Bounded Field; Kiritsugu decides to destroy the entire building instead of mounting a direct offensive against the defenses inside. With as much pride Kayneth has as a magus, he is willing to stay inside, believing with all certainty that Kiritsugu will invade rather than giving any thought that his entire castle will be destroyed instead. While Kiritsugu is able to fight most magi with modern weaponry, there are some special cases he calls \"formidable enemies.\" Following the methodology that technology is a blind spot to most magi, he finds that many of them easily overcome by night vision and a heat sensor scope. However, most magi will not deviate from that generality; there exist those that are impossible to measure with rules and experience. Against those who Kiritsugu's normal strategies will not prevail against, he must act as a magus and use his Mystic Code, which is his most powerful weapon. Even facing such an opponent, he is extremely adept at forming strategies and analyzing enemy movements and their magecraft, performing well even under tremendous stress from active combat. Within just one encounter with Kayneth's Mystic Code, he is able to find three weaknesses, form a countermeasure against it, and plan for his final assault.Partners  Kiritsugu is able to work in tandem with multiple parties, but he regards those people simply as \"tools\" to further his goals. His relationship with Maiya Hisau is that of a pupil and a teacher, but due to viewing magecraft as a tool, there isn\u2019t a single sense of master and pupil between them. He has only taught her a \u201cway to fight\u201d so that he may also freely use her as a \u201ctool.\u201d She acts as a vanguard scout, and due to years of working together, they are very in sync with each other's actions. She is a \"supporting machine\" whose actions are even more akin to a machine than those of the machine called Emiya Kiritsugu, and an \" indispensable final weapon\" to help him win the battle. Out of all of his teachings, she is most skilled with using bat familiars supplemented with cameras, and she makes use of a Steyr AUG assault rifle with a replaced night vision scope while still remaining under five kilograms. She is more of a soldier than a direct combatant, so he generally trusts her with reconnaissance and scouting due to her skills with familiars, and he allows her to procure all of his equipment. They have exchanged strands of hair between them, which Kiritsugu used as the basis for a spell in order to act as a measure indicating the worst-case scenario in which it has become impossible to use a wireless network or familiar to convey information. The enchanted strands were embedded in the subcutaneous tissue of their pinky fingers with the purpose of sensing if the Magic Circuits of one of them entered a state of extreme stagnation, the stage at which one's life force was weak on the verge of impasse with death. If the hair embedded in either one of their fingers starts to burn, it is a warning to notify them of the existence of danger, and it really essentially acts only as a signal to inform that \"it is already too late.\" He follows the methodology that Servants are the tools of their Masters, and that no matter how famous the hero, they will be nothing more than that as long as they are summoned as a Servant. Despite Saber being one of the most powerful Servants of the Saber class, he finds that Assassin or Caster would suit his style of combat more appropriately. Due to Saber's chivalrous preference for direct confrontations and fair battles, it is hard for him to coordinate with her. He instead has Irisviel pretend to act as Saber's Master, while he acts from the shadows. They only speak a few times in total, and are unable to ever agree with each other's methodology.Equipment  Kiritsugu lacks the various ritualistic catalysts used by normal magi like a dagger, cup, talisman, elixir, or spiritual container. He instead uses all state of the art weaponry that are unable to store any magical energy, which is the \"heresy\" that earned him his title. He utilizes a large number of different firearms and weapons to kill his targets. He also makes use of personal hand grenades, stun grenades, smoke grenades, C2 plastic explosives, and landmines, and he is skilled in incorporating them into traps with trip wires, hidden fuses, and a detonation system using a cellphone to trigger them through modified communication loops. He has number of Claymores, which simultaneously release around seven hundred steel balls with diameters of only one or two millimeters. They radiate outward in all directions in a fan formation with enough power to destroy an infantry unit in one strike. He is also familiar with setting up surveillance systems, allowing him to use a number of concealed CCD cameras throughout the Einzbern castle. He also has specialized magical equipment, such as an eye drop bottle filled with a liquid made from refining the body fluids of a succubus. It is sensitive to the blood of men and aged things, allowing it to immediately identify such substances. It is capable of comparing substances and distinguish differences accurately, allowing him to compare left over residue from shaving to a bloodstain to identify both as being left by Tokiomi.Avalon  Avalon, Saber's Noble Phantasm, is placed in his possession by Acht in order to be used a summoning catalyst. Rather than allowing Saber to have it, he hides its existence from her and keeps it for his own use. Normally, it would be used as the trump card of Kiritsugu as Saber's Master, but he is not present on the direct battlefield. It is a useless tool to him due to that Saber would not be able to provide it with magical energy since he is working so far apart from her. He leaves it for Irisviel's protection due to her acting as the front line substitute Master for most of the Grail War. Once returned to him, he seals it inside himself as a Conceptual Weapon and makes use of the contract with Saber to provide the full effects of its immortality. It revives him after his heart and lungs are completely destroyed by completely healing him seconds before his blood-deprived brain is about to die due to lack of oxygen. Even he is surprised with its potency, and decides to work it into his battle strategy to counter the negative effects of Innate Time Control. While it can heal both injuries caused by enemies and damage dealt to himself, it only nullifies the damage without taking away his pain. The state coupled with his Innate Time Control could allow him to defeat a Servant under limited conditions. The only ones he could readily defeat would be those who lack physical power like an Assassin after having been revealed or a Caster in close combat. Defeating those that specialize in hand-to-hand combat would require a special condition in his favor like surprise or suitability against the opponent.Calico M950  The Calico M950\u00a0(\u30ad\u30e3\u30ea\u30b3M950, Kyariko M950) is a submachine gun used by Kiritsugu and Maiya as a reserve sidearm. It has a compact size similar to a large handgun with a reinforced plastic that makes it look more like a toy when compared to the Walther. It has a unique helical-feed magazine that allows for fifty Parabellum rounds to be fired at a rate of seven hundred rounds per minute. It is also equipped with a sound suppressor, laser sight, and vertical foregrip.Thompson Contender  The Thompson Contender\u00a0(\u30c8\u30f3\u30d7\u30bd\u30f3\u30fb\u30b3\u30f3\u30c6\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc, Tonpuson Kontend\u0101), also called the Thompson/Center Arms Contender Custom\u00a0(\u30c8\u30f3\u30d7\u30bd\u30f3\u30bb\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30a2\u30fc\u30e0\u30ba\u30fb\u30b3\u30f3\u30c6\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc, Tonpuson Sent\u0101 \u0100muzu Kontend\u0101), is a special piece of equipment compared to his other weapons, which are armaments for the Magus Killer that can simply be bought and replaced at any time. It is something that cannot be bought with money that represents Kiritsugu as a magus, a Mystic Code with which he can use magecraft during battle against another magus. It is a one of a kind weapon only for his use that he has favored on many battlefields. It is used in conjunction with Origin Bullets\u00a0(\u8d77\u6e90\u5f3e, Kigen-dan), which are special Conceptual Weapons that utilize Kiritsugu's Origin\u00a0to its fullest extent by actualizing it within a target. The bullets were created from his first and second ribs on both sides being cut off, extracted from his body, ground into dust, condensed with a craft to preserve his soul, and sealed within sixty-six bullets as their core. The gun and bullets are stored within a rosewood case, which was left with in the care of Maiya during his nine years of retirement. It is 444\u00a0mm long and in its base form weights 1700g, with his modifications bringing the total weight to 2060g. The Contender was developed in 1967 by American company Thompson/Center Arms. It is a break-open single-shot pistol meant for sport shooting. Simple yet powerful, the weapon can, with little modification, be used to shoot various ammunition ranging from .22 LR to rifle bullets. While it is not suited for real combat, it was chosen as his Mystic Code due to it being able to deal the maximum physical damage possible. Its grip and forearm are carved in walnut, making it reminiscent of a dagger in its scabbard. The only visible mechanical parts are the trigger and the hammer, with neither a cylinder nor a slide on the simple exterior, making it similar to the percussion pistols used in the last hours of the Middle Ages. The lack of complex parts between the barrel and trigger allows for high accuracy. Kiritsugu's is customized with a fourteen-inch rifled barrel made for hunting specifications and fitted for .30-06 Springfield bullets. The cartridge of the bullet has a bottleneck structure, and its size and power level on an entirely different level from a handgun bullet. The .30-06 is 10% stronger than the .308 Winchester rifle bullet, and even surpasses the hand cannon class of a Magnum bullet. While it is a powerful weapon with especially powerful bullets displaying destructive power capable of easily puncturing bulletproof vests and killing large animals in a single shot when discharged from a handgun, its true use lies in the specialized firing pin and additional magical modifications for firing the Origin Bullets. Origin Bullets, containing part of Kiritsugu's soul, actualize his Origin of \"Severing and Binding\" upon contact with the target, which can cripple living creatures that are fired upon. There are no wounds or bleeding upon the bullet making contact, but the targeted area or body part appears to be suffering from necrosis. While it seems to have healed properly on the surface, the nerves and capillaries will never regenerate properly and the original function will be forever lost. While it would be bad for a living being to be hit by it, as a Conceptual Weapon, this bullet poses an even graver threat to magi in particular. Out of the sixty-six Bullets, thirty-seven bullets have been used, and not a single one was wasted after completely destroying thirty-seven magi. During the Grail War, he has access to twelve bullets, and Kayneth becomes the victim of the thirty-eighth bullet. The only person to render it ineffective is Kotomine due to the fact that he doesn't fight like an orthodox magus. Origin Bullets will immediately affect magi upon coming in contact with their magecraft. The only practical way for magi to defend against one is to discard all magecraft and defend purely by physical means, but he uses a particularly malicious method forcing the use of magecraft by making it impossible to physically block it. The bullets excel in penetration, and there is little outside of magecraft capable of blocking the specialized hunting rifle unless they are protected by the military-grade armor of an armored vehicle. Being forced to defend with magecraft, the impact of the Origin within the bullet affects everything all the way down to the Magic Circuits of the practitioner. If a magus' Circuits are a high-voltage power cable, then the impact of the bullet is comparatively a drop of water attaching itself to a thickly-placed electrical circuit. Once a conductive liquid becomes attached, the short-circuiting current will destroy the circuit itself, resulting in permanent damage. The more intense the pressure used to gather densely-packed magical energy for defense, the more active Magic Circuits will be functioning upon the moment of contact, and the more severe the destructive power of the bullet becomes. With an RPG analogy, it can likened to an attack that converts the MP of the user into damage, so someone with a high amount of MP compared to their HP would be overwhelmed and someone with a low amount of MP to their HP would only receive a small amount of damage. The \"Severing\" aspect will cause magical energy stored within the Circuits to ignore the paths within the body, flowing chaotically and destroying it in the process. Afterward, the circuits will be bound together again with the \"Binding\" aspect, albeit in a chaotic and useless manner, thus rendering them permanently inoperable and destroying the target's magecraft abilities. If used against a magus not actively using their Magic Circuits, such as Kotomine supplementing his own abilities with Command Spells instead of his own undeveloped Magic Circuits, it will target the source of the abilities instead. Targeting the one-use seal, it simply dissipates after being struck by the bullet without affecting Kotomine. Kiritsugu initially uses normal .30-06 Springfield bullets in order provoke the enemy into believing that those are his strongest weapons. Utilizing the bullets that have an initial velocity 2.5 times higher than 9mm bullets used by his Calico and seven times the destructive power, they become focused upon making sure that they can consciously defend against such an attack and focus most of their magical energy towards that task. When someone is provoked into using their utmost amount of magical energy, the damage is completely fatal. It causes excruciating pain within the body as the nervous system spasms while being broken down. Their internal organs are almost destroyed, and numerous muscles and nerves are damaged. If they do not die instantly, the wounds will quickly prove fatal, and even if healed by a magus, it would be impossible to recover enough to even stand again. Once Kayneth is struck, it takes a great deal of money and an expert puppet master to simply get his hands working enough to move a wheelchair.Walther WA2000  The Walther WA2000\u00a0(\u30ef\u30eb\u30b5\u30fcWA2000, Warus\u0101 WA2000) is a super heavyweight, semi-automatic sniper rifle of the highest class and performance that is the pinnacle of the latest electronic techniques. It costs $12,000 due to only being one of the 176 units produced. It is a rifle with a compact size measuring a little over ninety centimeters in length with the bullpup structure of the gun barrel with a gas-operated magazine measuring at a length of sixty-five centimeters. It fires a .300 Winchester Magnum cartridge that has an effective range of up to one thousand meters. While it is not equipped with its standard Schmidt & Bender telescopic sighting device, Kiritsugu has installed a pair of extra-large electronic optic devices as a special scope mount fixed in parallel above the barrel and on the left flank. The unit on the main side is the AN/PVS-4, the latest night vision scope used by the US armed forces that has been banned from being exported to prevent the leaking of technology to other countries. It uses a super sensitive video camera that acts as a light electrical amplifier with a lens, raising and displaying a perfect brightness. Acting as an electronic \"owl eye\", it multiplies the range of vision by 3.6\u00d7, allowing it to view up to six hundred meters under the moonlight or four hundred meters in starlight. The second unit is an Elcan Specter IR thermal weapon scope installed as sideways support. It is also electronically equipped for night vision, but displays the subject's heat pattern on the image display rather than acting as an intensity amplifier. It can perceive temperature variations from -5 to 60\u00a0\u00b0C up to two hundred meters with an 1.8\u00d7 magnification. The scopes are large and bulky, both being the size of plastic bottles and giving the relatively compact gun an air of unbalance, which brings the total weight of the gun to over ten kilos. Even with the steady progress of miniaturization, they are still large even compared to standard optic devices. It is a weapon more suited to a support fire squad more than a sniping weapon, and its practical use is hindered. Despite the challenge, it was within his calculations in best managing to make use of the weapon. The joint use of both scopes allows him not only the ability to fight in darkness, but they have also been configured to allow him to face off against a magus. Sensing the Magic Circuits within the dark, it can fire upon them from hundreds of meters away without them being able to detect him at all.Magecraft  The Emiya Magic Crest is carved on Kiritsugu's back, but he was unable to inherit it properly from his father as a normal magus. Due to the Sealing Designation, Noritaka's body was retained by the Association, and all the important parts of the Crest were confiscated. Through Natalia's negotiations, Kiritsugu was allowed to inherit part of the Crest, but it was only a \"fragment\" that contained less than half of the original amount. It was enough that he was able to use his abilities as a magus, but he had little interest in continuing the research in the first place. His only interest was whether it would prove practical as a tool in combat situations. While he relies on modern technology, he is still capable of using various different spells and techniques in his work. He is capable of using night sight by focusing magical energy to his eyes, allowing him to instantly see with impeccable clarity in the dark. He is proficient in using familiars, and he has taught Maiya how to use them as well. He can use basic hypnotic suggestions on those with no natural resistance to magecraft by making the target focus on his eyes. Kiritsugu's Elemental Affinity is the dual attributes of Fire and Earth, and as composite attributes, they are linked to his dual Origins, Severing and Binding\u00a0(\u300c\u5207\u65ad\u300d\u3068\u300c\u7d50\u5408\u300d, \"Setsudan\" to \"Ketsug\u014d\"). The previous generation of the Emiya family was at a loss upon finding the nature of his Origin, and named him Kiritsugu due to the strange results. Severing and Binding is different from the idea of \"destruction and rebirth.\" There is no chance of \"recovery\" in the case of binding, such as a string being cut and connected back together by tying the two pieces. While it is once again whole, there is forever an irreversible \"corruption\" in the form of a change in thickness where the knot it tied. It takes form in his everyday life when doing hands-on work, which caused him to become particularly aware of his Origin. While he can fix normal contraptions, he is not very skilled in working with delicate machinery. His unskilled hands suddenly cause everything to become the opposite, and the more he wants to fix something, the worse the damage becomes for the machine. He can use handcraft to piece together a snapped metal wire while still restoring the original function, but fixing a delicate electric circuit using the same principles will have fatal results. It is not something that will work as long as everything is connected, and if the connections are out of order, the circuit will lose its function. Rather than being caused by his personality or temperament, it is the true essence of the root deep within his soul.Innate Time Control  Innate Time Control\u00a0(\u56fa\u6709\u6642\u5236\u5fa1, Koy\u016b jiseigyo) is Kiritsugu's personal application of the Emiya family's magecraft. They spent generations researching and seeking the magecraft that controls time, eventually reaching \"Time Manipulation\", which is the ability to separate the passage of time inside a designated space from the \"flow of time\" in the outside world. It is classified as High-Thaumaturgy in the form of a Bounded Field that can be regarded as a type of Reality Marble in a way, but still not something extraordinarily difficult to utilize like other time related magecraft or something on the level of the True Magic that is unable to be replicated. It allows for \"time adjustment\" that can only stagnate the time which has passed and accelerate time in the future rather than something more advanced like \"time modification\", which has the ability to reverse cause and effect and change the past. The major problem is that the practitioner needs to consider the size of the Bounded Field and the scope of time that needs to be modified. It requires a large amount of magical energy and similar rituals in the same magnitude of High-Thaumaturgy to activate it. It would normally be applied to a wide area and a long period of time, taking longer to set up and more magical energy to utilize it as the Bounded Field becomes larger and the deviation in time becomes longer. It is not an ability that can be used on the battlefield where strategies must be quickly made in order to survive, as it must be prepared beforehand and used strategically even after the preparations. The Magic Crest of the Emiya family contains generations of inherited research, but that is unimportant to Kiritsugu. It was a useless inheritance until he found a way to use it to its maximum potential in a combat situation. He worked around the issue of size and magical energy consumption by creating a flexible method of utilizing it on a small scale that only applies to himself. This allows for the establishment of the Reality Marble at any given time without the need of extended rituals. It is impossible to completely isolate the flesh from the outside world, but the ability can minimize the effect the outside world has on the body. Keeping the scope of the spell to a minimal bounded field within his own body, it doesn't allow for the world to be affected, but rather allows for Kiritsugu to \"adjust\" a few seconds of time within his own body. He uses the chant Time alter\u00a0(\u56fa\u6709\u6642\u5236\u5fa1, Koy\u016bji seigyo), followed by the degree of speed he wishes to use. The chant accel\u00a0(\u901f, soku) allows him to speed up, while stagnate\u00a0(\u505c\u6ede, teitai) slows him down. He can use Release alter\u00a0(\u5236\u5fa1\u89e3\u9664, Seigyo kaijo) to stop it an any point. Time alter - double accel\u00a0(\u56fa\u6709\u6642\u5236\u5fa1\u4e8c\u500d\u901f, Koy\u016bji seigyo nibai soku) is his most used version, allowing him to move faster than the human eye can see. It speeds up his blood flow, hemoglobin metabolism, and muscle movement all at the same time. Using this brief burst of speed, he can use his own physical skills and reaction speed at a level far above human limitations. It allows for split second evasion in front of an enemy, and its power of mobility can make for one of his greatest defenses. Normally double accel is enough to push his body past its limits with brief use, but with Avalon providing regeneration, he is capable of using Time alter - triple accel\u00a0(\u56fa\u6709\u6642\u5236\u5fa1\u4e09\u500d\u901f, Koy\u016bji seigyo sanbai soku) and the quadruple-accelerated time of Time alter - square accel\u00a0(\u56fa\u6709\u6642\u5236\u5fa1\u56db\u500d\u901f, Koy\u016bji seigyo yonbai soku) for an extended period of time. Using stagnate, he can slow his biological processes, and using Time alter - triple stagnate\u00a0(\u56fa\u6709\u6642\u5236\u5fa1\u4e09\u91cd\u505c\u6ede, Koy\u016bji seigyo sanj\u016b teitai) reduces them to one third of their normal speed, slowing his heartbeat to the point where he can barely feel it himself, slowing his breathing so it lags, and reducing his metabolism to the point where body temperature cools quickly enough to almost match room temperature. The sound of his presence is reduced enough that Volumen Hydrargyrum is unable to make out his breathing and heartbeat from the other noises in the natural world, and it is unable to recognize him by using the standards of a human. While there are not any changes within the actual world, his optic nerves and eardrums register what he sees and hears from within the bounded field. His cornea receive three times the light a person's eyes normally receive, which makes his field of view extremely bright, and his hearing is dulled. Even with his minimalistic approach, it is still High Thaumaturgy far above the level of basic physical enchantment that causes inconsistencies between the flow of time inside and outside the field. Once the movement is complete and the field is removed, natural forces, the \"world\u2019s own adjustment\", will forcefully adjust the \"incorrect time.\" This places a large burden on Kiritsugu with each use, as the bounded field where the \"errors have occurred\" is within his own physical body. In order to get back in sync with the normal time flow, adjustments occurring within his flesh greatly damage him. Even brief use has him accompanying death, and continuous activation is nothing less than suicide, making it his riskiest technique. When returning to normal from stagnating, he suffers from the blood flow speeding up back to original speed, which causes burst capillaries and internal bleeding. Without the use of Avalon, Double Accel is his limit when speeding up, and even a few seconds of it is enough to rupture numerous blood vessels and cause fractures in the bones of his limbs due to the burden. Provided with constant regeneration from Avalon, he makes use of the ability's purpose as a strategic weapon to its full potential by utilizing higher levels while enduring his body breaking down and healing at an extremely high rate. He still feels the torn tendons and snapping bones tormenting his nerves while shedding mists of blood with every movement, but the regeneration allows him to keep fighting with accelerated speed for a much longer duration of time.Development Creation and Conception  Takashi Takeuchi feels that the young Kiritsugu looks like the protagonist of a shonen manga. While he was the protagonist of Fate/Zero, he is lacking in artwork compared to other characters, as he only appeared on the cover twice. One shot was from the back, while the other was only a silhouette. Gen Urobuchi felt that, because he abstains from the flashiness of Heroic Spirits, the best solution was to make him unnoticeable, as a \"character who spreads justice should speak with their back. Despite his shadiness, he still uses boku\u00a0(\u50d5), a first person pronoun most generally used by young boys. It was part of Nasu's design of the character, as Urobuchi felt he could never come up with it. Tomonori Sudo was in charge of Kiritsugu's character design for the anime version. He first thought Kiritsugu was a character who was not capable of expressing much emotion. Since he's a character with the strength to blot that out, it was a difficult thing to bring out the side of him that's rather frail and weak in comparison to his hard exterior. When Rikiya Koyama first played Kiritsugu in Studio Deen anime adaptation of Fate/stay night, he got one dialogue where Kiritsugu looked at the night sky and said \"the moon is beautiful tonight\" and then died with a sad laugh. However the staff were so touched that they made him do take after take of the line. Koyama was glad to do it, but he wondered why they were so concerned about one line in a huge production. Later on he found out the line was a key point that started the entire story of Fate. He was very surprised when he heard that. Because he had been in that, he was able to play the part of Kiritsugu again in Fate/Zero. He had never thought that tiny part would lead to a development like this..Reception References Lancer (Fate/Zero)  Lancer\u00a0(\u30e9\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc, Rans\u0101) is the Lancer-class Servant of Kayneth El-Melloi Archibald in the Fourth Holy Grail War of Fate/Zero. He is a chivalrous servant who wishes to do his best to serve his Master and obtain victory within the war for the Grail. He shares a bond of mutual respect with rival Servant Saber, wishing to face her in an honorable duel to the death. He is one of the Servants able to be summoned by Ritsuka Fujimaru in the Grand Orders of Fate/Grand Order.Profile Identity  Lancer's True Name is Diarmuid Ua Duibhne\u00a0(\u30c7\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u30c3\u30c9\u30fb\u30aa\u30c7\u30a3\u30ca, Dirumuddo Odina), the son of Donn, foster son of Aengus \u00d3g, and first warrior of the knights of Fianna. He is known as Diarmuid of the Love Spot\u00a0(\u30c7\u30a3\u30eb\u30e0\u30c3\u30c9\u306e\u611b\u306e\u9ed2\u5b50), due to a magical love spot granted to him by a young girl. Any woman who gazes upon the spot instantly falls in love with him, which eventually leads to an encounter with Grainne, the bride of Fionn mac Cumhaill. Gr\u00e1inne, having fallen in love with Diarmuid at her wedding party, placed a geis upon him to run away with her. It has been said that, even while at large, Diarmuid stuck to his fidelity to Fionn and did not lay a finger on Grainne. They were pursued relentlessly by Fionn, but after much blood was shed, he decided to recognize their marriage, granted Diarmuid a proper title and land, and welcomed them back as subjects. Sometime later while hunting with Fionn, Diarmuid was fatally injured by a Demon Boar, the reincarnation of his half-brother. Fionn, who had the ability to transform spring water in to a powerful healing agent was with him, so he had no fear of death. Fionn only needed to walk a few steps to the nearby spring, but with jealousy and hatred towards Diarmuid on his mind, he spilled the water twice. By the third time he went to scoop water, Diarmuid had already succumbed to his wound. The story of his tragic love affair with Grainne would later become the model for the story of Lancelot and Guinevere.Appearance  Lancer is regarded as a remarkably handsome man with quirky long hair combed backward in a rough fashion that has a strand hanging down his face. He wears a dark teal outfit, similar to that of C\u00fa Chulainn's. due to their shared Celtic mythology. Irisviel instantly notes that his features are capable of sweeping a woman's heart at a glance. It is described that the bold features of his face are the high bridge of his nose and his valiant eyebrow. His hard cut mouth marks him with a stoic air, but his eyes seem make his gaze even more brilliant. Takeuchi considers his charm point to be his droopy eyes and button of a mouth. He has a strong, attractive manly scent that rises from him. She soon realizes his elegant air of beauty is somewhat unnatural. Even though his features are considered handsome, much of it comes from his spiritual power charming women due to the curse of his beauty spot.Personality  Lancer is an extremely proud and noble knight who wishes to serve his lord to the best of his abilities. The geis laid upon him by Gr\u00e1inne was taken by Lancer as a test of his pride. He never once blamed her for forcing it upon him, and he truly admired her ability to throw away her pride, title, and future for the sake of her love. He was constantly distressed by the fact that he betrayed his lord, and even as he died while Fionn did nothing, he did not blame his lord for his actions. Lancer believed that despite the cruel twist of fate that led him down this path, the days spent with his lord and his love were used to the fullest. Lancer sees the Grail War as a miracle that will allow him to regain his pride as a knight by fighting noble battles and delivering the Grail to his Master. He sees no use in wishing upon the Grail, as simply being summoned has already half-fulfilled his greatest desire. If Diarmuid appreciated Kayneth's talents and experience, then Kayneth would have treated him with a much softer attitude. To Lancer's disappointment, Kayneth doesn't believe him in the slightest and constantly looks down on his pride as a knight. He constantly berates Lancer, believing that Lancer plans to betray him and take his fiancee, Sola-Ui Nuada-Re Sophia-Ri, by using his magical spot. He is also a coward who constantly make demands that would have Lancer betray his code and win by all cost. Despite his Master's distrust and lack of character, Lancer remains extremely loyal, though he fears that Sola-Ui's attraction to him will eventually cause him to betray his Master once more. He happens to be a submissive man as he constantly took abuse from his Master while offering little resistance to stop it. Lancer adheres strictly to the codes of chivalry and upholds his pride as a knight to the fullest, steadfastly believing in honor during battle. While being pursued by the knights of Fionn, he refused to fight against his former comrades. Despite having been presented with several chances to kill either Saber and Kiritsugu, he refuses to do so due to the circumstances with which he can do so are against his code. During his battles with Saber, he attempts to provide for the fairest conditions possible. His code and pride also forbids him to ignore evil. During the Caster crisis, he even goes as far as to fight alongside Saber, acting as her \"left hand\", after she suffers the crippling wound from G\u00e1e Buidhe in order to be able to face her in battle again in the future. He is willing to go so far as to destroy Gae Buidhe, so as to allow Saber to use her Noble Phantasm to destroy Caster, simply because Caster himself is a great evil that has to be wiped out, despite the fact that he himself has nothing to gain from it.Role Fate/Zero  Lancer is summoned by Kayneth El-Melloi Archibald in the fourth Holy Grail War instead of the Rider-class Servant, Iskander, whose catalyst was stolen by Waver Velvet. The contract formed with Lancer is unique in that while Kayneth holds the Command Spells, the energy to materialize Lancer is maintained by Sola-Ui, Kayneth's fianc\u00e9e. Lancer, on the orders of Kayneth, actively makes his location known in order to entice a battle, while Kayneth hides his location. Saber and Irisviel von Einzbern answer this challenge, and eventually Lancer attains the upper hand by successfully striking her with G\u00e1e Buidhe. Before their fight can continue, Rider interrupts the battle, then followed by Berserker, and Archer. Once Berserker begins to attack Saber, Kayneth orders Lancer to join him and finish her off. As it is against Lancer's code of honor, Kayneth uses a command spell to force him to attack. Rider, who holds similar values of honor to Lancer, decides to force Berserker to retreat, and threatens to face Lancer with Saber if Kayneth doesn't back down. Lancer is later berated for his actions, though Sola-Ui cuts it short by criticizing Kayneth for not actively participating. Lancer stands up for his Master, who is irritated by Lancer because he believes that Sola-Ui has become infatuated with him. Before the issue can be addressed, their base, Fuyuki Hyatt Hotel, is attacked by Kiritsugu Emiya and Maiya Hisau, who destroy the hotel's foundation and collapses it around the three. When Kayneth and the other Masters are offered a reward of extra Command Spells for defeating Caster, Lancer is sent to kill off the magic-wielding Servant, who at the time is engaged in battle with Saber. With Saber's help, he is successful in dispelling Caster's monster army with Gae Dearg, but abandons his duel with her in order to rescue Kayneth from Kiritsugu. Rendered bedridden and unable to perform magic, the injured Kayneth is forced to hand over his remaining Command Spells to Sola-Ui, whose infatuation with Lancer has escalated to near-obsession. Lancer is uncomfortably disturbed by how his current situation resembles his past life. Lancer plays a key role in defeating Caster, when the Servant summons a giant monster to wreak havoc on Fuyuki City. He willingly destroys G\u00e1e Buidhe in order to remove the enchantment inhibiting Saber's abilities, allowing her to employ her full power and destroy Caster. Lancer returns to the last location where he and Sola-Ui were supposed to meet, only to find Sola-Ui's severed hand. Lancer returns to a displeased Kayneth, apologizing profusely for failing to protect Sola-Ui. He tries to ease Kayneth's displeasure by informing Kayneth that Sola-Ui is still providing Lancer with mana, meaning she is still alive. Kayneth remains furious and openly mocks Lancer, on top of threatening to use a Command Spell he obtained from Risei Kotomine to force Lancer's obedience. Saber and Irisviel later confront Lancer to finish his duel with Saber, but both are unaware that Saber's Master, Kiritsugu, had already formulated a plan to eliminate both Lancer and his Master. They have an equal battle for a time, though Lancer is unsettled by the fact that Saber is simulating the injury from Gae Buidhe. He believes it is out of pity, but she corrects him in that fighting with honor is the only way to draw out her true strength. The battle ends when Kiritsugu, holding Sola-Ui and him hostage, coerces Kayneth into using his last Command Spell to force his Servant to commit suicide; Lancer is thus forced to drive G\u00e1e Dearg into his own chest. The shocked Servant realises that he has been fatally betrayed by his current Master, just as his former master Fionn had caused his death during his first lifetime. Enraged with his one wish being denied again for others', especially his Master's personal gain, Lancer dies cursing the Holy Grail, Kayneth, Sola-Ui, Saber, Kiritsugu, and the world at large for his fate.Einzbern Consultation Room  Lancer appears in the Einzbern Consultation Room, a metafiction segment analyzing the story, that takes place after he dies and becomes absorbed into the Holy Grail. Lancer has amnesia due to the mental trauma caused by the various events of the Holy Grail War, only remembering certain key parts that gloss over his misery. He enters the dojo believing it to be a school of martial arts that he can challenge, but he is told by Irisviel von Einzbern that they provide consolation. Student 0, temporarily falling under his curse, consoles him on not being able to remember his Master and his wife, telling him to forget his painful past, including his relationship with Grainne. Though she convinces him that he must have died nobly in combat against Saber, Lancer wishes to progress a proper and noble Grail war to a romantic relation with Saber. Irisviel, acting as an agent for the Grail's corruption, brings back his despair by making him remember the true nature of his death before being fully absorbed.Fate/unlimited codes  Lancer appears as an unlockable character in Fate/unlimited codes. To unlock him, you have to unlock Saber Alter and Leysritt. To make him show up, you have to get at least three KOs with supers (if game is set to best of 3) before reaching stage 5. Beat Zero Lancer and continue clearing arcade to unlock him. He is known as Zero Lancer\u00a0(\u30bc\u30ed\u30fb\u30e9\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc, Zero Rans\u0101) with the title Loyal Knight of the Fianna\u00a0(\u5fe0\u8aa0\u306a\u308b\u30d5\u30a3\u30a2\u30ca\u306e\u9a0e\u58eb, Ch\u016bseinaru Fiana no Kishi). Unlike the other characters, he lacks any sort of story mode. He notes that it is an undeserved honor to receive the chance to take up arms again, saying that he will not let the chance go to waste. Should he defeat Saber, he exclaims that it was the conclusion he had sought, and that he is thankful for having the opportunity to challenge her once again. He also notes that it is an unbelievable honor to face Lancer, a memory he will cherish deeply.Fate/Grand Order E Pluburis Unum: The Grand Battle of Legends in North America  Diarmuid appears in the \"E Pluribus Unum\" Singularity. He serves as a part of the Celtic army under Medb. He and Fionn mac Cumhaill attack Ritsuka Fujimaru, Mash Kyrielight and Florence Nightingale. They face the Protagonist's party again on Alcatraz and are finally killed there.Salomon: The Grand Time Temple  Diarmuid is amongst the \"E Pluribus Unum\" Singularity Servants to aid Chaldea against the Demon Gods Pillar.Interlude  In his interlude, he faces Fionn mac Cumhaill.Other appearances  In Type-Moon's April Fools' Day 2009, moon.cinemas.jp is a fake movie theater site listing a number of parody films: In Type-Moon's April Fools' Day 2015, Lancer is in a group called YARIO and is part of the Imperial Roma talent agency, his class is Farm idol unit\u00a0(\u7267\u6b4c\u7684\u30a2\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb\u30cb\u30c3\u30c8, Bokukateki Aidorunitto). Lancer is called Diar-something-kun\u00a0(\u30c7\u30a3\u30eb\u306a\u3093\u3068\u304b\u541b, Diru-nantoka-kun) in Fate/GUDAGUDA Order.Abilities  Lancer is an extremely accomplished spearman, capable of skillfully using two spears of different lengths with blinding speed and agility. His amazing warrior prowess is seen when he, despite having his back turned to Saber and not seeing her, is able to put her completely on the defensive, with no opening for a counterattack. Even when he resorts to utilizing just one spear, which is not his preferred style, he is still able to fight Saber without being at a disadvantage. His Noble Phantasms are his twin spears, Gae Buidhe, a spear that makes any wounds caused by it unhealable, and Gae Dearg, a spear that pierces through mana. He keeps them tightly wrapped in amulet cloths from their tips to the handles, sealing their abilities and acting as a counter-measure to avoid revealing their names by hiding the shafts of the weapons. Their abilities begin working immediately after undoing them from their bindings. Also qualifying for Saber, it is likely that it was Kayneth's original expectation to have summoned him as Saber. He is extremely calm and perceptive during battle, and with his Eye of the Mind (True) skill, he will always have a much greater possibility of winning or properly escaping from battle. He is extremely insightful, as he is capable of leading Saber, whose Instinct skill allows her to avoid danger, into a well thought out trap. By utilizing her lack of knowledge of G\u00e1e Buidhe, he made Saber believe that he had simply abandoned it, and later managed to lure her into a position where he could freely kick it towards her. He obtains no geographical boosts from the cultural sphere around Japan, and due to his greater mana supply from his Master, he has a greater advantage against C\u00fa Chulainn in terms of pure firepower. C\u00fa Chulainn would gain an edge over him should they fight in Ireland. Lancer has exceptional speed, the highest rank possible for a Servant and a high Strength rank, though the rest of his statistics are much lower. His Magic Resistance renders only high level magic a threat to him. He can easily defeat Servants who rely heavily on their Noble Phantasms. In addition to his close quarters combat prowess, he is confident that he is able to hit Caster's grimoire from the shore of the river with his lance if he can glimpse it for just a moment. This is a throwback to his legend, where he used the same lance to strike down a flying witch after he was in great pain from having been hit with poisonous darts. He has a good chance of genuinely winning the Grail if a sound tactic is used, but his failure mainly resides in the poor Master-Servant dynamic between him and Kayneth. It is noted that Assassin could potentially defeat him quickly, but no explanation is given as to the reason. He possesses a curse of the Mystic Face variety, not unlike the Mystic Eyes exhibited by Medusa. The curse takes the form of a beauty spot on his face, and causes any woman who looks upon his face to instantly fall in love with him. It can be overcome by individuals with high magical resistance, such as accomplished magi and Servants. While he follows the codes of chivalry during the War, it would be possible to have him to use underhanded tactics to have a better chance at claiming the Grail. Convincing him that Heaven's Feel is filled with filth instead of an honorable battleground with other heroes and avoiding contact with Saber to keep him from awakening his Chivalric Pride would allow him to utilize Gae Buidhe in a hit and run strategy. Briefly engaging opponents in order to land precise hits with the spear and then retreat would become the main form of attack. He would not directly engage them, allowing him to cripple his opponents one by one by repeatedly attacking them. The other tactic would involve manipulating or taking advantage of Team Berserker in order to let Berserker defeat other Servants and fight him in the final battle.Development  Toshiyuki Shirai (Animator Director) first debut in episode 16. His young and vivacious pen draws Lancer and Saber's lively battle, as well as the anguished expressions on Lancer and Kayneth's faces. He said the plan for Lancer's scene was to have him turn into particles of light and fade away. But since he was the type of person who would have cursed everything as he died, Toshiyuki changed it so that he would be enveloped in black mist and crumble away. Even though it was a last-second change of plans, he said it was thanks to the staff who churned out terrific elements, it ended up being a memorable scene. Ryuji Higurashi said Zero Lancer was a lot easier to draw than Lancer for the Fate/Unlimited Codes.Creation and Conception  He was a rare character to write for Gen Urobuchi because he normally views beautiful characters as either evil or stupid as an ironclad rule following that, if a man is too beautifully formed, his life would become truly miserable. Kinoko Nasu carefully picked out the tragic Celtic hero. It surprised him that Urobuchi, who faithfully followed the beginning of Fate/stay night's story where Saber beaten the Lancer at the start of the story, but he also copied its ending where Lancer committed suicide. He was designed by Takashi Takeuchi as having the manner of an English rocker. Atsuhi Ikariya was in charge of the character design for the anime version.Reception  Takeuchi calls Lancer as the faithful dog while Kayneth the stubborn man. Hikaru Midorikawa (Voice actor of Lancer) said Lancer had quite a few of scenes, but he was struck by the scene where he curses them as he dies (episode 16), and by the way he's shown as being so vigorous in the first half of the episode. He was so lively that when he's forced to kill himself, you feel sorrier for him. Midorikawa thought his suicide scene was handled delicately. There's an illustration for that scene in the original (the TYPE-MOON VERSION). But they presented it differently in the anime. Midorikawa was really impressed at how well they pulled it off. Midorikawa wished that they allow Lancer and Saber to go on fighting forever as Lancer seemed to be enjoying himself. Takumi Yamazaki (Voice actor of Kayneth) said that if team lancer had applied themselves, they would have been the favorite to win the Holy Grail War. Toshiyuki Shirai said Lancer was really popular at Ufotable, with his, \"I'm glad I met you!\". He was nicknamed \"Sparkling Lancer,\" and the day after he finished the keyframe art, copies would be posted at the animator's desks, and some of the girls even added world balloons that made him say \"My Master!\"References Sakura Matou  Sakura Matou\u00a0(\u9593\u6850 \u685c, Mat\u014d Sakura) is one of the three main heroines of Fate/stay night and the Master of Rider in the Fifth Holy Grail War. She is also the Master of Avenger, Saber Alter, and the blackened Berserker in the Heaven's Feel route. Sakura is the younger, adopted sister of Shinji Matou and biological sister of Rin Tohsaka. She has a long-standing and obvious crush on Shirou Emiya, who sees her as family. After Shirou's confrontation with Shinji, Sakura would often visit Shirou's home to help him with his daily chores.Profile Background  Born as Sakura Tohsaka, she is the biological sister of Rin Tohsaka and daughter of Tokiomi Tohsaka and Aoi Zenjou. Like most magi, her father chose only one daughter to carry on his family's tradition as he believed raising an additional child would introduce competition. Zouken Matou, an ancient ally of the Tohsaka House, offered to adopt Sakura with the intention of training her as the successor of the Matou's magecraft as his own heir, Shinji, was incapable of sorcery. As a result of her natural abilities, Zouken sought to use Sakura as one of his future vessels, empowered by the Angra Mainyu. Having to endure the cruel training under Zouken and Byakuya, Sakura became an empty and emotionless shell resigned to her fate. When Kariya Matou, Sakura's adopted uncle and her mother's childhood friend, learned of Zouken's intentions, Kariya attempted to win the Fourth Holy Grail War in hopes of liberating her. Unfortunately, Kariya died in his attempt and Sakura was unable to understand Kariya's motivation for trying to rescue her. His death demoralizes her and she convinces herself that she should not attempt to fight against Zouken. After gathering the tainted fragments of the shattered grail from that war, Zouken hybridized the collected black ichor with several of his crest worm familiars. He implanted these parasitic worms into Sakura's body, which drain her Mana but feed on her carnal impulses Sometime later, Sakura met her new brother Shinji (who was studying abroad at the time of the Fourth Holy Grail War) when he returned to the Matou house. Though he later came to love and accept his new sister, he bullied her. This ended the day Shinji found out that Sakura had become the heir to the Matou family instead of him and he became harsh with her, just like everyone else in the Matou house. Because Sakura was apologetic and expressed pity toward him, Shinji took that as Sakura submitting herself to him since she displayed no emotion. Sometime after the death of Byakuya, Shinji began raping her. Although castigated and humiliated on a daily basis, Sakura maintained her bearings with great stoicism. For the eleven years after her adoption, Sakura grew to resent Zouken for his cruelty, Tokiomi for sending her away, and finally Rin, for never coming to save her. However, she still kept the ribbon Rin gave her. Sakura drew her strength to endure such hardships from Shirou, whom she admired for his dedication. The inspiration she found came from watching him persistently attempt to jump a bar during a track-and-field practice session. She joined the Archery club in order to be closer to Shirou watching him from afar.  A year before the events of Fate/stay night, after Shirou was injured in an accident, Sakura gathered enough courage to approach and help him; she has visited him ever since to assist with daily activities.Appearance  Sakura is a young woman with violet hair, which she styles with a red-pink ribbon on the left side, and violet eyes. The ribbon she wears in her hair was given to her by Rin when they were children and is the first ribbon Rin ever made. Physically, Sakura is noted to have very \"large breasts\". During school, she wears the standard Homurahara uniform. Her casual clothing consists of a pink cardigan, a white top, and a long cream-colored skirt. In ufotables' movie adaptation of Heaven's Feel, Sakura is seen wearing a long white dress with short sleeves and a black sash, and white sandals. She sometimes wears a pink cardigan or puffer jacket over top. In the Heaven's Feel route, her appearance changes when she becomes Dark Sakura. Her hair turns white and her eyes turn red, but she retains her trademark ribbon. She wears a long black dress made of black ribbons, that are trimmed in red. The length of the dress and the length of the ribbons it is composed of vary. In this form, her face, dress and legs are covered in red markings. Before Sakura was adopted into the Matou family, she resembled her sister, having had short black-brown hair and teal eyes. Shortly after her adoption, at most a year after, her hair and eyes take on their violet color, which is a direct result of Zouken's torturous training changing Sakura's body. Her clothing at this time consists of a purple dress, purple socks and black shoes.Personality  While Sakura is outwardly shy, soft-spoken and eager to please, she possesses a great inner strength. As noted by Shirou, she can also be openly stubborn at times. However, she is also prone to feelings of resentment towards others. Despite the cruelty she endures living with the Matou family, she is given a brief reprieve in Kariya, her adoptive uncle and the only person who genuinely loved her. When he dies in the Fourth Holy Grail War, Sakura mistakes Kariya's last attempt to free her from the Matou house as a warning from Zouken as the fate of those who disobey him. The incident cements Sakura's despair and resignation towards her own suffering. However, her own resolve is strengthened after she falls in love with Shirou Emiya and becomes closer to him by helping him with domestic tasks to express how she cares about him. During Fate/stay-night, she begins to feel isolated when she believes that Shirou is beyond her reach. When she becomes Dark Sakura under the influence of Angra Mainyu, her personality changes drastically; she becomes a devilish, evil, and cruel person. Sometimes she talks about herself in the third person.Role Fate/Zero  \u201cI do not have anyone to call my mom or sister...Grandfather said I should think that they never existed\u201d\n \u2014Sakura speaking to Kariya before the Fourth Holy Grail War - Fate/Zero, Episode 1 In Fate/Zero, Sakura is adopted into the Matou family one year before the Fourth Holy Grail War begins. Sakura is described as soft-spoken and often in the shadow of her more energetic sister, and her adoption has deeply affected both Aoi and Rin, who both try not to express their unhappiness openly. Kariya arrives in Fuyuki City three days after her adoption, which he learns from Aoi. Having been a childhood friend of Aoi, he had become well-acquainted with Sakura and her sister, who were both fond of his company. After confronting Zouken, Kariya makes a deal with Zouken to win the Holy Grail in exchange for Sakura's freedom to return to the Tohsaka family. Kariya was the only member of the Matou family to love Sakura, who became resigned and emotionally withdrawn from the torture she endures from training under Zouken and Kariya's older brother, Byakuya. Unfortunately, Kariya is defeated during the Fourth Grail War and failed to obtain the Grail. With the last of his strength, Kariya returned to the Matou mansion to return Sakura to Aoi and Rin, but he died in the process. Sakura, who was standing in front of Kariya, interpreted Kariya's death as a warning that those who defy Zouken will die. She remained with the Matou family, demoralized and unwillingly to fight against Zouken.Fate/stay night  Sakura only plays a minor supporting role in the Fate and UBW route and she only appears as Shirou's friend. She visits Shirou every day and competes with Rin for his affection. In the Fate route, Sakura, like everyone else at school, becomes a victim of Rider's Blood Fort Andromeda, though her injuries only result in her staying at home. She becomes good friends with Illya in the epilogue after the latter made her get over her depression about Shinji's \"disappearance\". Sakura is also made vice-captain of the archery club. Sakura would not develop as the \"Black Grail\" in any other route. However, when she was chosen by Shirou, \"the person she does not wish to lose\", the negative emotions she kept bottled up all these years came flooding out, which accelerated the growth of \"All the World's Evil \u2013 Angra Mainyu\". In Studio Deen's anime adaption, her role is expanded slightly beyond her appearances in the Fate scenario. After the defeat of Berserker, Sakura is captured by Caster to use as a sacrifice in order to summon the Holy Grail and is held at Mount Enzo, Caster's stronghold. Shirou, Rin, and Saber attempt to rescue Sakura and to stop the Holy Grail from being summoned, during which Shirou and Saber are forced to fight against Souichirou Kuzuki and Assassin respectively. Rin confronts Caster, who manipulates Sakura to fight against Rin. During the fight, Sakura is revealed to be Rin's sister and that she actually comes from the Tohsaka family. In order to save her sister, Sakura allows Rin to stab her so Rin will be able to sever Sakura's magic circuit and prevent Caster's plans from being completed. Following Caster's defeat, Sakura recovers at Shirou's house and ultimately survives the Fifth Holy Grail War.Heaven's Feel  \u201cNo Senpai. I'll probably end up hurting you...I'm going to hurt you, Senpai, but...I want to stay like this.\u201d\n \u2014Heaven's Feel Sakura is the principal Master of Rider, who was summoned several days prior to the start of the 5th Holy Grail War. However, under pressure from Shinji and the desire not to fight either Shirou or Rin, Sakura yielded her Master's right to him, although Sakura retains her original Command Mantra. As Rin and Shirou became closer, Sakura began to feel contempt for her sister, which was intensified by the fact that Rin took no action to help Sakura. Zouken, disgusted at the ineptitude of Shinji as a Master, begins a genocide against the other Servants with help from True Assassin and Sakura morphed into a premature form of Angra Mainyu, referred to as \"the shadow\". Berserker, Lancer, Saber, and Archer are all absorbed or terminated by this unholy trinity, and Sakura regurgitates Dark Saber and Dark Berserker as assistants. At night, she goes on a rampage throughout Fuyuki City, ingesting large numbers of innocents for mana. Gilgamesh eventually confronts and impales Sakura's body with several Noble Phantasms from within his Gate of Babylon, but she regenerates at an impossibly fast rate and consumes him as well. She is forced to quickly convert him to mana in haste because she was afraid he might tear her up from the inside if she does not digest him. Meanwhile, Shirou, who was not attracted to Sakura and only saw her as a friend and Shinji's sister, realizes that something is wrong and that Sakura is suffering. Shirou decides to protect her, but he is unsure of his feelings for her. Because of it, Shirou is devastated when he found out that Sakura is one of the participants in the Grail War. He starts doubting about his ideals because he still wants to save everyone but realizes that if he does so, Sakura might die. Finally, after a talk with Illya and later Archer, Shirou abandons his ideals in order to protect Sakura. With this new ideal in mind, he finds Sakura crying at the park, believing that she cannot be saved. Shirou consoles her by telling her that he will always protect her and he fight for her. However, Sakura continues having her strange dreams. Recognizing the devastation she has wrought, Sakura seeks out her grandfather to force him into ending her life in order to protect Shirou. However, along the way Shinji attempts to blackmail her into sex, threatening to tell Shirou of his history of raping her. Horrified at this prospect, Sakura murders Shinji and gives into her internal malice. She then realizes that she is the shadow that appeared in her dreams and becomes Dark Sakura and proceeds to abduct Ilya, hoping to use her as the core for a new Holy Grail. After Shirou and Kotomine rescue Ilya, Dark Sakura stops the supervisor's artificial black heart, giving him only a few hours to live. She also assimilates True Assassin and purges her body of Zouken's worms. She is confronted by Rin in the chamber of the Greater Holy Grail beneath Mount Enz\u014d, her power equally matched by The Jeweled Sword of Zelretch. Rendering Sakura's shadows useless, Rin makes her way to Sakura, but is unable to give the finishing blow due to her love of her sister. Rin embraces Sakura even after Sakura has stabbed her in panic. Realizing Rin's love, Sakura again starts resisting the malice within in her long enough for Shirou to dispel Angra Mainyu's grip on her soul with Rule Breaker. If Shirou traces Excalibur and destroys the Grail, his life extinguishes, which results in Sakura's Normal Ending. Refusing to accept Shirou's death, Sakura continues to live in the Emiya household, forever waiting for Shirou until eventually dying of old age. She later reunites with Shirou in what is insinuated to be the afterlife. If Ilya intervenes, closes the gate, and performs Heaven's Feel on Shirou to keep him alive and close the Grail once and for all, it results in Sakura's True Ending. After her dark self is destroyed, Sakura's body is left containing vast amounts of mana due to her connection with Akasha. She ends up living with Shirou and Rider, with the servant's existence sustained by Sakura's mana pool. Sakura is the de facto Winner of the 5th Grail War in this route, though Kirei Kotomine proclaims Shirou to be the Winner.Manga  \u201cNii-san...Senpai...Will we ever be able to go back to those happy times?\u201d\n \u2014Fate/Stay Night Manga, Chapter 24 In the manga version of Fate/stay night (which follows the Fate and Unlimited Blade Works scenarios), Sakura is a supporting character. She is trained by Byakuya Matou rather than Zouken (who does not appear in the manga); while Shinji does not rape her, he is still abusive towards her. However, she shows concern for both Shirou and Shinji, wishing for the three of them to be good friends like they used to be before the Grail War. She quietly watches the fight between Saber and Rider from afar and after Shinji is defeated by Saber and Shirou and falls from a building, Sakura uses her last Command Spell to make Rider save his life, revealing to Shinji that she is the Master of Rider. After this, Shinji feels guilty after all he has done to her and apologizes. She is currently taking care of Shinji at the hospital and has not appeared since.Fate/hollow ataraxia  In Fate/hollow ataraxia, Sakura lives a peaceful life in Fuyuki City, which Rin has left in Sakura's care while she is at the Mage's Association, and Rider comments that Sakura is now the popular new captain of the school archery club. Sakura's dark side still exists, but appears only for comic relief. Shinji reveals to Shirou that Sakura assumed control of the Matou household, and both he and Zouken are terrified of her. In her Eclipse scenario Life of Sakura Sakura takes Shirou into the Matou residence's garden where they are looking at cherry blossom trees in bloom. Sakura then shows very old tree to Shirou, that according to her was planted by her grandmother and now is blooming for very first time in life. Amazed by this fact both are watching this tree for while. After that Sakura invite Shirou into her room where they continue talking about rebirth of old tree. Whereupon Shirou express that he want to see Sakura to \"bloom\" as well and then they both have sex. Sakura also appears in Rider's Eclipse scenario The backside of Kibisis where she and Rider appear both naked in front of Shirou and seduce him with their gorgeous big breasted bodies into threesome. However eventually it turns out that whole scenery is just Rider's illusion that she made in order to force Shirou to pursue Sakura more aggressively. Yet in the middle, Shirou realizes the truth and reverses her spell on her, in the end revealing to viewers that Rider herself has deep feelings for Shirou. Sakura appearing in this episode is only a conjecture by Rider's spell, a representation of Rider's true intentions of her actions.Fate/Unlimited Codes  In Fate/Unlimited Codes, Dark Sakura is a playable character and she is known as the Makiri's Grail\u00a0(\u30de\u30ad\u30ea\u306e\u676f, Makiri no Sakazuki). In her story, her personality becomes twisted and she wants to destroy everything along her path. She has already killed Zouken by the time she encounters Kirei Kotomine. Kirei can tell Dark Sakura is on the verge of collapse and the personality of Sakura Matou is still within Dark Sakura. Although Dark Sakura claims she is broken, Kirei founds the Matou can raise the young well but the training are too harsh which Sakura appears to have no concern of pain. She further explains that Zouken didn't expect her to last long and ironically he didn't last long to die. Kirei pleased with Zouken's death and expects to wait for the Holy Grail to form by removing Sakura's consciousness. Kirei was impressed with Dark Sakura knowledge but Sakura kills him in the battle, she claims that she will complete his plan in his place. Her final opponent is herself, her counterpart has stayed behind in order to help the growth of Avenger and the Great Holy Grail. They both fight to the death because there is no point for having two Sakura and they hate themselves the most. Dark Sakura fused her memories with her counterpart, although she is uncertain who actually died. She finally completes the transformation of becoming the Holy Grail and gives birth to \"All the World's Evil\". In her ending, she desires to get out to the outer world and wants to meet Shirou when she is reborn. However, she forgets about Shirou existence and longs to get out to the outer world. In Kirei's story, Kirei used Sakura in order to learn the meaning of life and was responsible for Dark Sakura transformation. In the opening Dark Sakura approach Kirei in the church. Kirei notices Sakura to be very different to their last meeting and he is pleased that she conceived Avenger. She already devoured both Lancer and Gilgamesh and she desires the life energy that has kept Kirei alive. It appears that Sakura's mind and body is completely contaminated aligned with the \"curse\". Dark Sakura desires to pay back everyone who made her suffer. Kirei pointed out that although Sakura appears to be a different person but she is pretending in order to protect Sakura Matou as a person. While Kirei escapes, Sakura convinced herself that she can kill him with two of his servants gone. Kirei encounters Shirou, Shirou wants to destroy the Holy Grail in order to stop Avenger in order to save Sakura.Carnival Phantasm  Despite being one of the heroines in Fate, she has a minor role in Carnival Phantasm, compared to Saber and Rin. However, she has a segment focusing on her, Type-Moon Serial TV Novel Sakura, parodying a soap opera. Her darker personality is comically exaggerated, such as complimenting herself in her monologues and having her stalk Shirou on his dates with the other heroines, all while showing a mischievous, evil grin and getting there before he does.Today's Menu for Emiya Family  Sakura makes frequent appearances in Today's Menu for Emiya Family, being a regular guest at Shirou's house. She is shown cooking in Episode 5 with Shirou and Episode 8 with Rin at the Tohsaka Mansion. Sakura's speciality is Chinese food.Other appearances  In the \"EXTRA\" universe, the Moon Cell replicated Sakura's data and created a NPC with the same name Sakura Matou who is an Advanced AI in charge of the health of Masters. In Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA\u2606ILLYA, Sakura appears briefly to help Shirou after he is injured. An alternate Sakura is an ally of the Ainsworth family, where she is equipped with a Lancelot Class Card. Julian Ainsworth controls her by taking Shirou's appearance. In the \"Apocrypha\" universe, Sakura was adopted by distant relatives. She ended up as a pro-wrestler and forming a tag team with a Luviagelita Edelfelt. Sakura makes an appearance in Fate/Grand Order as a Craft Essence card. She appears as the illustration cover for Imaginary Number magecraft\u00a0(\u865a\u6570\u9b54\u8853, Kyos\u016b Majutsu) and Imaginary Around\u00a0(\u30a4\u30de\u30b8\u30ca\u30ea\u30fb\u30a2\u30e9\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9, Imajinari Araundo).Abilities  Sakura was born with great potential and rare natural talent, considered to be a miracle equal to that of Rin with even the same Od level as her. It surpasses the norm of \"natural talent\" or \"inborn skill\" possessed by others, and due to that she would be in danger without the protection of a magi house, can be equated to a curse in a way. She was given to the Matou house to act as their heir for this reason, but Zouken did not intend to use her for that purpose. For the purpose of acclimatization, she has to undergo constant torture in the basement of the Matou household. The way they pass on their magecraft is not a study, but constant, lifelong torture due to Zouken's preference. Taught to the body rather than the mind, she is forced through immense pain and stress constantly for her \"education.\" The changes are so extensive as to change her hair color, eye color, and every cell in her body so that they no longer reflect her Tohsaka heritage. While having greater potential than Kariya or Byakuya, she is more suited to the Tohsaka magecraft. She was born lacking an Elemental Affinity of the \"five great elements\", and instead had an Imaginary Element of Imaginary Numbers, or \"Hollow\", as her affinity,\u00a0Sorcery Trait\u00a0and Origin.\u00a0Her Element\u00a0was changed to the water alignment with her acclimation to the Matou magecraft, so she cannot display her true talent.\u00a0Her Crest Worms will feed on any excess magical energy she circulates before she can use a spell, leaving her unable to even cast any in most cases. Due to them devouring it on a constant basis, even Rin is unable to tell that her sister is an actively practicing magus. Without expecting anything from her intelligence, Zouken sought to turn her into a tool that uses magecraft. With such little formal education, she is unused to combat and cannot normally match someone of Rin's caliber, losing ten out of ten times without being able to breach Rin's barrier. Rin compares her to a bird with the potential of flight being placed in water, forced to die or adapt as best it can. While she would have had great success as a Tohsaka magus, her current state is much like that of the untrained Shirou, only worse due to her lack of physical training. Under duress, she can cast a spell using the Matou \"absorption\" nature magecraft, and it shoots like a spear, stabbing and entangling the part hit to drain the person of energy. She says that it has little practical use compared to something like Reinforcement that has many different uses in that it is limited to \"stealing away from others\" and feeding on their pain.Magic Crest  The Magic Crest of the Matou family is in the form of Zouken's Crest Worms, forcefully implanted into her as part of her acclimatization process. They have grown within her for eleven years, turning into a nerve that has entangled throughout her entire body like a Magic Circuit. It is suspended under normal circumstances without have an effect on her body, but it will attack her nerves and use her energy to roam throughout her body while taking even more if it activates. Left for half a day, they will drain her body of energy and consume her flesh as nutrition. As with any Magic Crest, it is painful containing a foreign substance in her body, but even more so with it entangling her nerves with its own and moving about. Compared to the pain experienced in Rin's arm, she compares Sakura to a cluster of Magic Circuits that violates her function as a human being and should overwrite her mind with a wave of energy. Normally only an observation device for Zouken, its usage can be activated by her lust, which in turn causes her to lust even more as the worms in her blood become an aphrodisiac. It can be forcefully activated with an aphrodisiac given to Shinji or just through her normal feelings for Shirou. As they devour her energy, she becomes more lustful and is forced to seek out supplemental energy, semen in the original story and blood in Realta Nua. Zouken should be able to incite the worms into action as he pleases, making it a priority to stay away from him. As his main body has been changed to a small worm next to her heart, that is actually impossible. As they are so integrated into her nerves and Magic Circuits, it is impossible to remove them normally, even for Zouken. Kirei Kotomine uses a large number of Command Spells to remove most of it, but he cannot remove the ones metabolized with her nerves without removing her heart. Its original usage is not meant as a means to kill her, but the conditions of the Fifth War provide a unique opportunity. Imposed on her to make sure she participates in some capacity, they will activate if she breaks a \"certain condition\", abandoning the war as a Master. Entrusting Rider to Shinji falls under the condition, but it will torture her should she refuse to battle while having Rider's contract. Even forcefully removing her contract with a Command Spell would cause her to be instantly consumed. With the added burden of managing Rider's upkeep, it is difficult for her and could lead to it devouring her. It is set to last for the duration of the Holy Grail War, and will spread further with each day. Kirei's surgery is able to reduce her overall pain somewhat, but she is still plagued by the same overall problem.Black Grail  At some point after the Fourth Holy Grail War, Zouken managed to collect fragments of the destroyed Grail and implanted them into Sakura's body, transforming her into an incomplete lesser Grail. Sakura has been developed to be able to act as the Black Grail\u00a0(\u9ed2\u306e\u8056\u676f, Kuro no Seihai), a second Lesser Grail, by Zouken Matou. Though the ritual of the Fourth Holy Grail War ended in failure with the destruction of the Holy Grail, it had briefly been completed. It would normally be painful to have the inorganic substance of the Grail within a human body, so he turned the shards into a living thing to allow her to still function as a human. Combining them into Crest Worms, he placed them into her body. Zouken lacked the skill of the Einzberns and completed an eighth of the process in his own way, so she is in an incomplete state. The shards corroded and assimilated her Magic Circuits over the ten year period between the Fourth and Fifth Grail Wars, leaving her with only her Crest Worms as her only way of using magic if she even did. She has the ability to function like the Einzbern Lesser Grail, Illyasviel von Einzbern, in acting as a container for the souls of the Heroic Spirits and becoming the gate upon the ritual's completion. Zouken originally has no plans for her to be utilized fully in that state during the Fifth Holy Grail War, but instead as an experiment in acting as \"Makiri's Holy Grail\" that is able to live as a human and contain the function to collect souls. The purpose of changing her is mostly as a way for eventually reaching his goals, slowly developing her into something like the Holy Grail over several decades. While it would be impossible for her to go into that state in other routes, the conditions within the Heaven's Feel route allow for her to become active. Only when being chosen by Shirou Emiya, the \"person she does not wish to lose\", do her bottled up negative emotions come to the forefront to accelerate Avenger's growth. Previously thought of as only an unadaptable Holy Grail, she shows surprising growth and talent in being able to retain her senses after eventually taking in a number of Servants. He equates her to a true Holy Grail one the same level as the Einzberns, even though he had thought it impossible. Servants that come into contact with the shadow from the Grail are greatly affected. They cannot oppose it, rotting them anywhere it touches. They lose feeling in the affected areas as they become that which does not exist in the world. Proper Heroic Spirits are extremely affected, going as far as losing consciousness on contact, while Servants close to it in nature, while not fully affected, well have energy drained from touching it. Those taken in and not digested are blackened, changing their mentality as it is corrupted by its malignant influence and considerably augmenting offensive power. While she can take in and blacken most Servants, Gilgamesh is unable to be controlled, so she must digest him in haste to keep him from tearing her up from the inside. Converted to magical energy, he provides enough to accelerate the development of the Grail even without enough Servants. Though he is difficult to digest, the large amount causes her to buckle like a broken dam due to previously being able to only barely maintain herself. Differing when he escaped from the Grail mud in the Fourth Holy Grail War cut off from the main body, that of Sakura, the shadow, is connected to the body of Avenger itself. Servants are unable to resist her, having become the Grail itself, and even being incarnated is not enough as long as one is materialized under the Grail System. As with the Einzbern Holy Grail, the container cannot retain full human function while taking in souls of Heroic Spirits and receiving the powers of the Holy Grail. Her body loses function as the amount of energy she contains from the souls increases, and the overflow from great swirl of magic of the Holy Grail is too much for her mind to withstand. It causes her to break down until becoming Dark Sakura, first showing an overall loss of feeling in her extremities and the state of recent memories becoming vague.Black Shadow  With the development of Sakura as the Holy Grail, the Black Shadow\u00a0(\u9ed2\u3044\u5f71, Kuroi Kage) begins to manifest around Fuyuki. It is the contents of the Grail, Angra Mainyu, leaking out from the other side when Sakura is unable to properly shut the gate even as a complete Holy Grail. It is a Cursed Boundary Layer, Sakura's shadow or even Sakura herself, normally controlled below her threshold of awareness. While it seems that it works with Zouken, he cannot communicate with it, and he can only arrange its path to keep it from running wild. Though he is able to calm it nightly to keep the damage to a minimum, he eventually becomes unable to handle it as Sakura develops. It devours magical energy at first, only leaving people unconscious. More ruthless in its feeding than Caster, it eats their magical energy along with their minds. It eventually realizes that eating them fully is more efficient, taking hundreds of people from fifty households in one feeding. Rather than smashing them, it only needs to swallow them, body and soul. It is an \"unidentified object\" that gives the impression of a jellyfish on land or a deep sea monster. Its presence dominates all who look upon it, seeming to distort space around it. It lacks eyes, limbs, or a body, but still casts a shadow at its base. It looks insubstantial, as if a shadow were to stand with so light an existence that it looks able to simply be blown away. As the Holy Grail's shadow, it should not normally have form or a will, but passing through the gate, Sakura, it takes her form, borrows her sealed id, and obtains a body to come into the world. It is a Holy Grail with a will, seeking out humans souls to complete itself. It will swallow all it sees, especially clumps of magical energy like Ilya. It should be possible to stop by stopping Sakura, as it is born from her unconsciousness. It hates whoever Sakura hates, so it will keep them from coming near her. It is impervious to all conventional attacks, and its targets can only await death in its presence. Shirou is unable to tell of the concept of death can even apply to it. As a cluster of curses, its touch is highly corrosive due to containing Angra Mainyu's property of All the World's Evil, dissolving organic matter and converting the base elements into pure magical energy. It can lash out with tentacles, bring forth a Shadow Giant, and spread out for ten meters to swallow everything like a wave of water, touching them with All the World's Evil that burns skin like coal, cuts off their life, and shows them its horrors. It takes in energy just by existing, turning plant life black, and automatically leeching it from those without any resistance. It can absorb the energy in an area in order to swell up and explode. It tramples over everything upon exploding and spreading the collected energy out like a storm, swallowing its prey instantly. It can overwhelm all Heroic Spirits no matter their strength so long as they are summoned under the Servant system, filling even the mindless Berserker with the instinct to run away. Spreading its mud over the ground like a swamp, Servants engulfed by it are restrained down by countless tentacles and swallowed. It easily tears through Lancer's Rune barrier, capable of blocking great Noble Phantasms. It dislikes organic material, passing through that which is not alive and digesting that which is alive. Taking them in instantly, the Cursed Boundary Layer is a Bounded Field of dissolution much stronger and more instantaneous than even Blood Fort Andromeda. Growing by the day to feed even more, it swallows an area of fifty meters at once, and then goes on to act as a tidal wave that passes through all things to take its victims without causing a bit of collateral damage. It is not detectable because it is not a specially activated spell, but its regular actions even if it is extremely powerful. Connected to Sakura, she can initially only feel slight aftereffects from its feedings, but later begins to have uncontrollable visions of it acting. Both its smell and the presence behind it remind Shirou of her, and she feels an intimacy with it, something without an evil mind that, while similar to her, just eats in a different way. She becomes more in-tune with it as the war progresses, eventually coming to the point where she is the one wandering the town at night. It begins to originate from her as her affinity with it develops, feeling its hunger as her own and allowing her to swallow Gilgamesh. It begins to stretch out on its own, allowing her to hear and see through it directly. After becoming Dark Sakura, the Command Spell around her body has the same make-up as the Shadow.Dark Sakura  After Sakura rejects Zouken's control and regains her central consciousness, she becomes Dark Sakura\u00a0(\u9ed2\u685c, Kuro Sakura), a rancorous and psychotic distortion of her normal self. It would normally be that she would either have exploded from the strain of being the Grail or have had her consciousness disappear and be overtaken by the shadow. Due to her affinity with it, she is able to take control of it. Touching Angra Mainyu, the mud of the Grail, contaminates a person's personality and reverses it towards the orientation of evil. Her reasoning and emotions are severely impaired, and she is indiscriminately destructive to everything around her. She is one capable of using the power of the mud as part of her own power due to the contamination. As she develops, she becomes a \"threat to humanity\" that could potentially have required or eventually gotten to the point of needing intervention from the Counter Force. Even with this overwhelming strength, being unused to battle and her unstable mental state makes planning against her possible. Using souls as a perpetual motion machine to create magical energy, Rin calls her a poor imitation of the Third Magic. Connected to the \"other side\" of the Grail, she has a stock of magical energy that cannot be used in a lifetime, effectively making it infinite. Despite that, she can only use the full capacity of her Magic Circuit to instantaneously release one thousand at a time. Against the Jeweled Sword, Rin is able to release the same amount to match the shadows, making it a battle of Sakura's limitless magical energy and Rin's infinite magical energy. With the same properties as the Shadow, she is capable of forming tentacle appendages from her body. She can spontaneously regenerate, allowing her to recover from mortal wounds within minutes of receiving them. Even before fully developing, she survives being impaled by the Gate of Babylon, having everything below her stomach severed, with only severed nerves being the issue the next day. She can support a number of Servants without issue in this state, and Saber can use the energy intensive Excalibur without limit. After the contract to Avenger is broken at the end of Heaven's Feel, she is still connected to the other side of the Grail. As an after-effect of the contract, she remains a Holy Grail. While Avenger still exists before Shirou destroys the Greater Grail, it could potentially make her its Master again due to the connection. Vast amounts of energy are collected in her body, and she must periodically release it. She is able to use it to keep up Rider's existence even without support from the Grail, and the excess left after that is given to Shirou to help him maintain his body. She learns magecraft from Kirei's successor and Rider, and her abilities as the Holy Grail, even only in part, are a large boon to her life as a magus.Shadow Giants  The Shadow Giants\u00a0(\u5f71\u306e\u5de8\u4eba, Kage no Kyojin) are familiars made out of her Hollow element. Under normal circumstances they are extremely small, but when her powers are augmented by Angra Mainyu and the Holy Grail, their size increases vastly and they start acting as a materialized curse. Each composed of roughly one thousand units of magical energy, they are called a match for the Noble Phantasms of Servants. She can bring them forth without limit, and the amount of energy spent creating them for just a single battle, over one hundred million, is enough to run a department of the Clock Tower for one hundred years. Carrying the properties of All the World's Evil, fighting them would normally require something to dispel a curse, but a level of energy equal to that making up the shadows can eliminate them. While Rin Tohsaka could not hope to destroy a single one normally, the Jeweled Sword of Zelretch allows her to match Sakura's limited output used to create them and destroy them with her infinite energy provided by the Second Magic.Development Creation and Conception  Her initial concept was based on Fujino Asagami. Upon looking at Sakura Tohsaka depicted in Character material, Gen Urobuchi thought \"aah, right now I'm writing about a world that does its best to brutally mistreat this kind of girl.\" It was a \"huge mental burden\" for him, so he decided to torment her even more. While she only appears twice, her \"misery index\" may actually be the highest in Fate/Zero. In the original draft of the scene of Kariya's death, the plot was \"inhumane.\" Nasu \"scolded\" him for it, asking him \"What color is your blood, anyway!?\" It became one of the few scenes he stopped, making Sakura's monologue into a very mild and calm one.Reception References Fate/stay night  Fate/stay night\u00a0(\u30d5\u30a7\u30a4\u30c8\uff0f\u30b9\u30c6\u30a4\u30ca\u30a4\u30c8, Feito/sutei naito) is a Japanese eroge visual novel game created by TYPE-MOON, which was originally released on January 30, 2004. It is TYPE-MOON's first commercial work, following its transition from a doujin soft visual novel group.Story Setting  Fate/stay night takes place in 2004, and its beginning happens at around the same time as the events of Tsukihime end. Fuyuki City is the setting for a secret and violent war among competing magi. For the past two centuries, seven magi were gathered and engage in a Battle Royale, each gambling his or her own life to obtain the Holy Grail, a legendary chalice capable of granting wishes. The past four Holy Grail Wars have typically occurred every sixty years, but the fifth war has eerily started prematurely, only ten years after the fourth war. Each magus, better known as a Master, is aided by one of the seven summoned spiritual familiars known as Servants, who are the reincarnations of legendary souls from all across time. These resurrected Heroic Spirits possess superhuman characteristics and wield powerful artifacts or abilities called Noble Phantasms. A Noble Phantasm's hidden abilities may be released by invoking its true name, but casual brandishing of a Noble Phantasm is best avoided, for symbolic Noble Phantasms usually belie a Servant's identity, diminishing their competitive advantage. Specific legends may be summoned with the aid of catalysts, which are artifacts, ideas, or experiences similar to or of value to the desired Servant. Only one Servant can be summoned in each war from one of seven classes: Saber, Archer, Lancer, Berserker, Rider, Assassin, and Caster. The Holy Grail is a spiritual artifact, so only astral entities, such as Servants, are capable of touching it. This forces Masters and Servants to cooperate with each other against rival pairs, even if a situation entails fighting to the death. A Master can control a Servant with three Command Spells, which are crystallized miracles issued by the Holy Grail that manifest on a Master's hand. When activated, a Command Spell permits the Servant to accomplish an incredible feat, or permits the Masters to issue an irrevocable and absolute order to the Servant. In the event of a Master's demise, a Servant may choose to bind him or herself to another Master. If a Servant is slain, a Master may ally with a wayward Servant, or pursue sanctuary with the Holy Grail War's impartial supervisor, who is traditionally a delegate of the Church.Plot  Fate/stay night chronicles a two-week period in the life of Shirou Emiya, an amateur mechanic who attends a school called Homurahara Gakuen in Fuyuki City. Ten years ago, Shirou was caught in a massive fire that incinerated his parents and consumed a large portion of the city. As he was dying, an enigmatic man named Kiritsugu Emiya discovered, saved, and adopted him. The two maintain a distant relationship because of Kiritsugu's frequent departures from Fuyuki City. One moonlit night, Kiritsugu and Shirou have a discussion outside their home, and Shirou learns that Kiritsugu was actually a mage. Through this conversation, Shirou learns of Kiritsugu's failed ambition to become a \"Hero of Justice\"\u00a0(\u6b63\u7fa9\u306e\u5473\u65b9, Seigi no Mikata), a guardian of mankind who could protect the weak and innocent. Touched by Kiritsugu's conviction, Shirou decides to achieve that distant ideal, much to Kiritsugu's chagrin. To do this, Shirou pleads with a begrudging Kiritsugu to teach him magecraft, but Shirou makes no progress in almost any the fundamental magecraft disciplines. Kiritsugu warns his son that the life of a magus that leads to destruction, but if he is truly set on benefiting people, he should apply his knowledge and hone his craft in secret. After Kiritsugu dies, Shirou becomes frustrated with his progress, feeling inadequate about his good deeds through magecraft. Shirou becomes unsure how to orient his future. After cleaning his school's kyudo (archery) dojo late one night, Shirou stumbles upon two Servants, Archer and Lancer, battling in the school courtyard. To preserve the secrecy of the war, Lancer chases Shirou and pierces him in the heart with a spear. Shirou's classmate Rin Tohsaka finds him bleeding and near death, and she uses an heirloom filled with concentrated magical energy to resuscitate him. Shaken and dazed, Shirou goes back to his home, but Lancer attacks him again. Shirou weakly defends himself but is overwhelmed by the powerful Servant's attack. Shirou falls into a storage room, and being cornered, he prepares for the worst. But before Lancer can inflict a fatal blow, a young woman in armor blocks Lancer's spear. She drives Lancer away, introduces herself as Saber, and greets Shirou with the words: I ask of you, are you my Master?Characters  As with Tsukihime, the character base in Fate/stay night is extremely comprehensive and expansive, with characters possessing varied and extraordinary abilities.Gameplay  The gameplay of Fate/stay night requires little interaction from the player as most of the game's duration is spent on reading the text that appears, representing either dialogue between the characters or the inner thoughts of the protagonist. Often, players will come to a \"decision point\" where they are given the chance to choose from options displayed on the screen, typically two to three at a time. The time between these decision points is variable and during these times, gameplay pauses until a choice is made that furthers the plot in a specific direction. There are three main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. To view all three plot lines, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices during the decision points to progress the plot in an alternate direction. Fate, Unlimited Blade Works and Heaven's Feel are the three branching stories found within the game. Each diverge at certain points, and depending on the player interaction, will end in one of several possible ways. The Fate scenario features Saber as the main heroine. In Unlimited Blade Works, Rin Tohsaka is the main female lead, but the plot focuses on her Servant, Archer. Heaven's Feel expands on the dark history of Sakura Matou and her family. There are forty bad endings that can be reached within the game, and each has a section called Tiger Dojo\u00a0(\u30bf\u30a4\u30ac\u30fc\u9053\u5834, Taig\u0101 D\u014dj\u014d) following it. It features alternate versions of Taiga Fujimura and Illyasviel von Einzbern elaborating on the endings and how to avoid them. The majority of the content has little to do with the actual endings, instead focusing on the skits performed between the two of them.Einzbern Consultation Room is a prequel story that ends with Taiga preparing to establish her own dojo to avoid all the bad endings.Development  Before Kinoko Nasu wrote Fate/stay night, he claims he was a big fan of the Samurai Resurrection manga, which involved battles between dead historical figures from around Japan. Nasu first began writing 'Fate/stay night in college and had not intended it to be a game. Initially, Nasu only wrote what would become the game's Fate storyline however the game went on to have three storylines, the Fate scenario being one of them. In his early drafts, Saber was a man, and the protagonist was a girl with glasses. This early draft was embodied in the short original video animation (OVA) Fate/Prototype, which was released with the final volume of the Carnival Phantasm OVA series. Nasu set aside the project and went on to found TYPE-MOON with artist Takashi Takeuchi. After the success of their first visual novel Tsukihime in 2000 TYPE-MOON transitioned from a dojin soft organization to a commercial organization. Nasu and Takeuchi decided to turn the old Fate story into a visual novel as TYPE-MOON's first commercial product. In the beginning, Nasu was worried that because the main character was a girl, the story might not work as a bish\u014djo game. It was artist Takeuchi who suggested switching the genders of the protagonist and Saber to fit the game market. There were originally to be four heroines with four routes. Saber and Rin would have comprised the first half, met in the middle of the story, and then it would have split into four routes from there. Their stories were written in one go, so Nasu felt he needed to \"flip the story over.\" Within the theme of Fate/stay night, Saber's route is posing a question, Rin's is the answer, and Sakura's is a practical application. Ilya was one of the heroines originally, and would have been part of the practical application with Sakura. Rather than only choosing to become Sakura's hero or fulfill his ideals as an Ally of Justice on the ninth day of Heaven's Feel, Shirou would have also had an option to become Ilya's hero instead. Due to the length, they thought to release Saber and Rin as Fate/stay night and Sakura and Ilya in a separate release titled \"Fate/other night\", but they thought it would have been too expensive. IIya's route was instead combined with Heaven's Feel because they decided to include Sakura's route in Fate/stay night. There was also a Caster route in development, but it was discarded entirely with the exception of the plot regarding the cooperation with Rider that is continued in a portion of the actual game. While not present in-game, the script files contain a joke about Shirou teaming up with Shinji. The Unlimited Blade Works (route) was written in the preview section of the 2001 winter Comiket booklet. While Nasu was designing parameter rules and various attributes in Fate, he was hoping to make another game similar to a wargame like Romance of the Three Kingdoms would be interesting.Release History  Fate/stay night was released in Japan on January 30, 2004 for Windows PCs.

Important related products include:Manga Games References External links Rider (Fate/Zero)  Rider\u00a0(\u30e9\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc, Raid\u0101) is the Rider-class Servant of Waver Velvet in the Fourth Holy Grail War of Fate/Zero. He is able to be summoned by Ritsuka Fujimaru in the Grand Orders of Fate/Grand Order.Profile Identity  Rider's True Name is Alexander the Great, the King of Conquerors\u00a0(\u5f81\u670d\u738b, Seifuku-\u014c), summoned as the adult aspect known by the name Iskandar\u00a0(\u30a4\u30b9\u30ab\u30f3\u30c0\u30eb, Isukandaru) rather than the youthful aspect known as Alexander. Known by many names, Alexander, Iskandar, and Alexandros, he was the young prince of the small kingdom of Macedonia in the 4th Century BC, said to have been the son of Zeus in many stories despite absence of clear evidence. He was known as a \"peerless pretty boy\" who was noticed by many sages, such as Aristotle, as a prodigy. During this period of his life, he spent much of his time training as a soldier, studying philosophy and political sciences, and reading great legends. While he bloomed with many talents, he approved of every and all possibilities, able to be called the \"personification of possibilities\" itself. He possessed a close friend, an \"amazing man\" who truly began to show his talents after Alexander's death, who would often drag him around rambunctiously in a manner to his later encounter with Taiga Fujimura, expanding Alexander's horizons thanks to his actions. Though considered beautiful, his self-recognition in being the child of Zeus granted him strength, reducing his boyish looks over time. He later encountered the Gordian Knot, cleaving the rope with his sword and taking the divine bulls offered to Zeus by King Gordius as his own for use with his chariot. Starting with succeeding the throne of Macedonia in Greece at the age of twenty, his conquest quickly subdued the neighboring countries and became the leader of Corinth. His eventually eyed his ambitions towards the straits, seeking to extend his reign into Persia. Sweeping through from the far west with his army, none underestimated it, rumors of its might spreading through countries long before the army's arrival. As his army's great morale overwhelmed even the most devoted of warriors, they were even more shocked when he spared them, told them of his goal, and returned dominion of the lands to the nobles. He exclaimed to them that: \"My goal is the end of the world. My destination is the furthest border of the East. I want to behold Oceanus with my own two eyes. I want leave my footprints at the beach beside that endless sea.\u201d Though they thought his words folly, many were rekindled to the dreams of their youth, setting off after Alexander to join his conquest. During the conquest of Persia, Alexander came to view Darius III and his Athanaton Ten Thousand as a worthy rival, blocking Alexander's path numerous times. The name Iskandar was given to him by the Arabs and the Persians. Due to Darius' immense height, after finally conquering the Persian Empire, Alexander required the footstool of Darius' throne to be swapped with a table to properly sit on it despite his own great height. This played a part in history recording Alexander as being short. After Persia and with a goal of the most extreme eastern edge of Asia, they marched through Egypt and through western India during the \"great eastern campaigns.\" Marching without end, they crossed boiling deserts, passed over chilling, snow-capped mountains, and forded billowing rivers. They fought savage beasts and fought for their lives through numerous unknown foreign tribes displaying alien weapons and battle strategies. Although an innumerable number of soldiers died, they kept their great morale to the end, holding proud smiles and listening to the sounds of the ocean they sought in their hearts, despite never reaching it. In the end, he brought about the largest empire in history to date and became the \"great king who built the era known as the Hellenistic civilization.\" He reached the success of a great hero in just ten years after beginning his conquest, but soon died after living only a period of thirty years. His dying words, \"Leave everything to the strongest.\" ended up splitting it apart instead. His campaign to the East went as far as India. There, his troops and generals complained of fatigue, and so he turned back to Babylon, where he suddenly passed away. Following his death, the empire split into four warring factions that \"quickly disappeared into the sands of history.\"Appearance  Rider is a gigantic man standing over two meters in height. He has large muscles that give the impression of being able to kill a bear with his bare hands. He has sternly chiseled features with eyes that give off a dazzling glow, able to overtake Waver's soul in an instant with their sharpness, and burning red hair and beard. He wears bronze armor, with cuffs and greaves with white-furred fringes, that leaves his arms and thighs unprotected. He wears a thick red mantle with a fluffy white fur collar. It is luxuriously decorated, and looks like a curtain wrapping the stage of a theater. At Stage 1, Rider wears his customary armor without his mantle. Rider's Stage 2 appearance is the same as that of Stage 1, but with the fur mantle added. Stage 3 Rider also wears added armor, and his fur seems a lighter color. While historical records called him short because he could not reach the foot stool of Darius III's throne after conquering the Persian empire and had to swap it for a table to sit on the throne, he claims that it is because he was truly short when compared to Darius. In the end, he considers that history written by random people cannot completely and accurately describe the situation back then, so he has no problems with the inaccuracy. During life, Alexander took the lead in wearing Asiatic clothing due to his interest in cultures of his conquered land, causing his followers to avert him like the plague. He does the same in the present, changing into contemporary styled clothes while in public because of trying not to lag behind Saber and her suit. He orders an XL sized T-shirt based on the Admirable Tactics\" videogame he takes to playing in his free time. It is white shirt with the logo of the game imprinted on top of the world map, looking much like a cheapskate product from the games segment published on the front page of the special edition a magazine. He is very happy with it because it gives him \"the effect of having the whole world on my chest\" and goes well with the conqueror outfit. Due to his pride in the shirt, he first attempts to move around in public without any pants or undergarments, which he doesn't find to be strange in the least. He refers to pants as \"that thing that causes you to stumble\", and hates the idea of having to wear them. Waver eventually buys him large jeans, so that he can actually go out without troubles.Personality  Rider is noble and physically overbearing. He is not pragmatic, but is a person who lets history run its course and acts according to his impulses. While he is wild and somewhat inconsiderate to others, his greed inspired his subjects and ultimately resulted in their happiness. He is always jovial, values friendship highly, and he regards the bond with all of his followers in Ionioi Hetairoi as his greatest treasure. They all, being inspired by such a magnificent king, in turn gives him their undivided loyalty and adoration. He also admires people who treat friendship with sincerity, such when he meets Taiga Fujimura. He is compassionate to those with whom he bonds, such as telling Waver that it is natural to be sickened by Caster's atrocities and that he would strike anyone who would feel nothing from the sight. He was adventurous and had the goal of reaching the edge of the world during his life, and he looks forward to conquering the world now that he has found out it is a sphere, and how small his empire that he spent his life conquering was compared to the size of the world. He desires to conquer the world as a human, so that is his only wish for the Holy Grail. He is not overly cruel as would be expected from a tyrant, but tries instead to keep bloodshed to a minimum despite his love for battles and destruction. He is fine with not actually winning the battle outright, and even attempts to recruit the other Servants as his followers after witnessing their prowess for himself. He prefers to conquer his enemies by winning without killing and controlling without humiliating them. He admires Saber's abilities as an individual and believes that she would be an amazing asset to his army. He is seen as a unique individual with strange ideas unbefitting of his legacy, but Waver is able to understand the meaning behind his conquest. He sees Rider as deserving of title of \"King of Conquerors\" because that which he strives to conquer most is not lands or material wealth, but the hearts of people, the toughest conquest that can be undertaken by anyone. His way of kingship is his greatest pride and as such, he despises Saber's way of kingship, the direct antithesis. He calls her naive for considering sacrificing herself to save her kingdom, and goes so far as to denounce her as a king. He insists that a king should be setting vivid examples to be followed, bond with his subjects at personal level, and his way of living should be something inspiring to and envied by all under his rule, not a distant ideal or martyr whose deeds would be praised yet whose path is so full of sorrow and pain that it would only inspire a sense of dread. To him, a selfless king who isolates himself from his people to die for ideals is nothing but a fool, which is worse than a tyrant. He is also in opinion that a king should be vibrant, a figure who is inspiring and leading his people, instead of being a distant loner who concerns himself only with protecting and saving his people. Ultimately, he would grieve and weep over his losses and mistakes, but he would stay true to himself and never regret decisions made as a king. He has a mutual rivalry with Gilgamesh, and offers for a joint conquest to take over the world. Despite all Servants who have first seen him thought him to be stupid and preposterous for a conqueror of his reputation, he eventually earns their respect, even Gilgamesh who rarely shows any respect to anyone, but he claims that he will only ever have one friend. The respect Iskandar inspired in Gilgamesh is great enough that the King of Heroes deems him worthy enough to be faced with Ea and Enkidu in their final fight, even though Gilgamesh can easily win without using them. Despite his Master's shortcomings and their vast differences in goals and personalities, Rider is very quick to start bonding with Waver on a personal level like he would with anyone during his reign, admiring his wit and determination despite Waver having the lowest of opinions of himself. During their first encounter with the other Servants, Kayneth Archibald El-Melloi, who was originally planning to summon Rider, begins to berate and torment Waver by calling him incompetent and weak. Rider instantly defends Waver's dignity by rebuffing Kayneth for only speaking to them while in hiding. Despite being timid, at least Waver would ride with him and Rider notes that only someone who will ride onto the battlefield with him is worthy of being his Master, so a coward who only hides in the shadows is a true shame to their battle. Rider is bisexual, so it is possible he would have attempted sexual relationships with both Kayneth and Sola-Ui Nuada-Re Sophia-Ri if he had been summoned by them. Rider takes a great interest in the modern world, often spending his free time eating crackers and watching videos to learn about the new world around him. He is also especially eager to go outside and experience things as a human. He especially takes a great liking to the video game called, Admirable TacticsRole Fate/Zero  Rider was summoned by Waver Velvet with an artifact; a mantle once worn by Iskandar. This artifact was originally Lord El-Melloi's and was stolen by Waver, who intends to prove that his teacher is wrong. Iskandar, the King of Conquerors, is noble and physically overbearing. He is an enormous man who has little interest in the Holy Grail and cares more about conquering the world again, especially now that he realizes the world is much bigger than he was aware of during his life. He is especially fascinated by ordinary aspects of modern life and intends to inform the world of his return, much to Waver's chagrin. He arranged a King's Meeting at Einzbern castle to discuss with the other Heroic spirit Kings about their desire for the Holy Grail. In the Kings Meeting, he expressed his desire for the Holy Grail is not for conquering the world but his true incarnation so that he can become a human again and not bound as a servant. However, after learning from Saber wish to change the past to save her country, Rider was disappointed and does not acknowledge Saber as a King, addressing her as \"little girl\" and calling her by her title with little intention other than mocking her. In a battle with Saber prior to his final engagement with Gilgamesh, Rider gambled using Gordius Wheel against Saber but his chariot was destroyed by Excalibur. Rider would not manifest Ionioi Hetairoi as he was saving it for Gilgamesh. Before the final fight, Rider asked Gilgamesh whether he can join forces together as Rider has his armies and Gilgamesh has his weapons and they can conquer the world easily but Gilgamesh declined, stating that there was only one comrade he would ever have and there could be only one king. He fought against Gilgamesh on a bridge, Rider used Ionioi Hetairoi: Army of the King as a final move. However, Gilgamesh wipes out half of the army with his Enuma Elish, causing the bounded field to dissipate. As a result of the instability, the rest of the army fades, leaving Rider with no choice but to charge him head on. Rider rushes bathing in the curtain fire of Gate of Babylon. Upon nearing him and right before he can deliver the final blow, Rider is bound stiff by Enkidu, and eventually slain by Ea. Gilgamesh appears to have had great amounts of respect for Iskandar, addressing the dying King of Conquerors with the comparatively more respect, and stating that he would be ready to accept his opponent's challenge at any given moment.The Outsiders\u2019 Performance  In the side story of the special drama CD, Taiga Fujimura as an adult tells Saber how she was inspired to become an English teacher when she encountered Waver and Rider in the fourth Grail War. Waver and Rider encounters Taiga after the king banquet, Waver becomes worried about the battle. Taiga encounters both of them during in the night after she fell from the roof. She was looking for the thief who broke into her friend Otoko Hotaruzuka's store and stole their best wine barrel. Rider becomes a translator for both Taiga and Waver, as Waver did not learn Japanese before coming to Japan, and Taiga explained to Waver and Rider that she chased after the thief until he flew off. Taiga instantly jumped in the cold water to save the dog while believing Waver and Rider would also help out. As Waver and Rider helped Taiga out of the water, Waver questioned why Taiga is so persistent on helping people. Taiga replied that she believes in kindness in others. Waver thinks this is quite cute, though Rider says something completely different which left Waver in disarray: Rider claims he wanted Waver to have a romantic experience. Taiga chased after an underwear thief, dragging Rider and Waver to help her. After they handed the underwear thief to the police, they helped reunited the puppy to its owner. Waver asked Taiga if she helped others, doesn't she have any problems herself. Taiga claims that she is worried about her love, school and future. Waver and Rider suggested she is suitable in teaching and guide those who seek knowledge. Waver suggested they should part ways and head back home but Taiga wants to go after the wine barrel thief. Waver and Rider explained that searching for the criminal at night in Fuyuki City is getting more dangerous. Taiga tried to introduce herself to the two but Waver hypnotizes Taiga to head back home for her own safety. Rider thought of stealing more wine barrels from the market for Taiga but Waver stopped him from creating more trouble, Waver had a plan that could help her. Taiga says an anonymous person sent a dozen barrels of high-class London red wine outside her friend's house.Fate/Grand Order Fate/Accel Zero Order  He is the servant of Waver Velvet.Salomon: The Grand Time Temple  Iskandar is among the \"special event\" Servants to assist Chaldea against the Demon Gods Pillars.Fate/Extella  He becomes a playable character for upcoming war and be available choice by Hakuno Kishinami. He's in Altera's party along with Altera, Gilgamesh, and Jeanne d'Arc. The Heroic Spirit Iskandar is a Top Servant in Moon Cell. When the Moon Cell senses that Altera has been released, it summons him to do battle with her. However, being unaccustomed to fighting on SE.RA.PH, with all its subtle differences to the Earth he lived and died on, he approaches the fight as a kind of warm-up. Because of that, he loses. Altera then declares that his life belongs to her, and forces him to join her army. Technically, this also makes him a Servant of Altera's Master, but Altera treats them both as if they were the same rank. Altera understands that her victory over Iskandar was a matter of circumstance, and that they are evenly matched in terms of strength. While, subsequent to their fight, she does wield power over him, she does not consider him to be beneath her \u2014 nor does she look down on Jeanne, whom she recruits in a similar fashion. Iskandar understands that as well; but accepts his defeat with dignity. From then on, he pledges to assist Altera in achieving her goals. Make no mistake, however: He is loyal only to Altera, and not the Umbra' Star.Other appearances  He was briefly mentioned in Einzbern Consultation Room, Rider went straight to the Great Grail without coming to the Consultation Room as he had no troubles and his master Waver was still alive. Irisviel von Einzbern commented that Rider and Waver pairing were very rare in the fourth grail war as they were happy with each other. Rider makes a cameo appearance in Carnival Phantasm in the last episode. He was seen drinking beer with Taiga and Gilgamesh. In Fate/Apocrypha, Fate/strange fake and Lord El-Melloi II Case Files, Lord El-Melloi II still kept his red mantle catalyst safely and he is often reminiscing Rider. He originally intended to lend the catalyst to Flatt Escardos. In Fate/strange fake, when Saint Germain first meets Richard Lionheart, he mentions having also met Rider when he was still alive, who apparently agreed to listen to the strange and eccentric man. In Type-Moon's April Fools' Day 2009, moon.cinemas.jp is a fake movie theater site listing a number of parody films. Rider was featured in Chariot Man: A True Tank Man\u00a0(\u6226\u8eca\u7537, Sensha Otoko), a parody film of Densha Otoko. Rider is a timid lone man and the main protagonist of the story. The story is expanded in TYPE-MOON 10th Anniversary Phantasm comic, he is wealthy and he lives with his household staffs. His story began when Iskandar saves Waver by punching Kariya Matou in the library. Iskandar asked his internet friends from the Eirei Throne Channel about recommending a gift, they all suggested a Saber figure. Sensha Otoko presented a Saber figure to Waver, a gift which Waver was conflicted because Iskandar said he loves the figure. Waver assumed Iskandar was talking about the Saber figure until Iskandar corrected her saying he loves the motorbike and the Saber figure was the decoration. He is later seen sulking in his room and regretting the present. Waver sent a message to Iskandar about her appreciation with the present and how she is interested in learning more about motorcycle from Iskandar. Iskandar happy with the message, he summons his chariot and destroys his room.Abilities  In combat, Rider mostly uses his Noble Phantasm Gordius Wheel to trample the enemies; the chariot is surrounded by lightning: this factor and its high speed are what make its charge a powerful attack, which takes the name of Via. Even without activating the Noble Phantasm, it is strong enough to almost knock out Berserker after one strike, forcing him to retreat. To summon the chariot, Iskandar slashes the air apart with his sword. While seemingly preferring to ride into battle, Iskandar has shown no hesitation in fighting on foot, showing prodigious ability despite being geared better towards mounted battle. He stands against three Assassins in Caster's sewer lair, skillfully predicting an ambush launched by one, intercepting the attack and killing the said Assassin with ease. He would have taken the other two on if had they not retreated shortly afterwards. He later manages to get within striking distance, potentially capable of a killing blow against Gilgamesh, despite his agility being quite laughable by servant standards. The sword that Rider wields is a spatha\u00a0(\u30b9\u30d1\u30bf, supata) referred to as the Sword of the Kupriotes\u00a0(\u30ad\u30e5\u30d7\u30ea\u30aa\u30c8\u306e\u5263, Kyupurioto no Ken, Sword of Kupriotes), gifted to him in life by the King of the Cypriots; its hilt was decorated with the likeness of a lion. Strong and light-weight, the blade can be wielded with great dexterity, and in the course of the story, it was able to deflect the Assassins' dirks with demonstrable ease. Though it is not noted to be a Noble Phantasm itself, it is utilized in the invocation of both of Iskandar's known Noble Phantasms. Incidentally, the historical Iskandar is said to have used a kopis instead. Iskandar's trump card and ultimate Noble Phantasm is Ionioi Hetairoi. Rider summons a Reality Marble that consists in a vast desert under a cloudless sky; in this place makes its entrance an immense army: every soldier is a Servant that, after dying and becoming a Heroic Spirit, still follows Iskandar's lead. Exploiting the plain and shelterless battleground, the King of Conquerors rides his horse Bucephalus and charges forward, followed by his army, in order to crush the enemies. Iskandar is also able to summon Bucephalus on his own outside of Ionioi Hetairoi.Development  He was first mentioned in the encyclopedia of Fate/side material.Kinoko Nasu claims that if he wrote Fate/Zero, Iskandar would have been more like Red Saber.Creation and Conception  Takashi Takeuchi considers Rider to be the key character of Fate/Zero due to the time and energy that went into his design. He considers it difficult to draw due to its complexity and detail. Gen Urobuchi compares him to a heavy tank and the Rider of Fate/stay night to a racecar. His Gordius Wheel embodies the \"tank-ness\", but it is too large to enter sewers. The original idea for it was to give it the ability to change sizes by substituting its parts and transforming, but it still would have been too large. Takashi Takeuchi feels that without his mantle, Rider gives off an intimate feeling that puts him in style with commoners. Takeuchi felt like a loincloth may have been suitable for him. Out of his initial designs, Takeuchi likes the one with the \"three feelers\" in the center.Reception  Nasu viewed Iskandar as a worthy opponent to Gilgamesh, but the Iskandar Urobuchi created was an excellent, wild, and unprecedented character that even he could have never thought up.References Skill  Servants under the Holy Grail War system are attributed with various Skills that reflect the abilities they had in life, or sometimes those granted by the specific class container in which the Heroic Spirit was placed in. Skills are divided into two main categories; Class Skills, which are typically connected to the Servant's Class, and Personal Skills, which reflect abilities or anecdotes connected to the life and legend of the Servant themselves (it should be noted that there are certain skills, such as Divinity, which have been treated as both Class and Personal Skills depending on the work and occasionally between different materials for the same work).Class Skills  Each Class is granted certain Skills upon summoning. They generally reflect the abilities that they had in life, but they will not always have had the corresponding Skills. Even if the Heroic Spirit did not have the abilities in life, they will still get a lower ranked version of the Skill automatically if they fit the class. Conversely, it is possible for a Servant of a different class to gain any of these skills as Personal Skills, as long as they reflect the abilities that they had in life. Class Skills can be lost due to another Skill or Noble Phantasm of the Servant, or due to the Heroic Spirit's nature.Authority of the Beast  Authority of the Beast\u00a0(\u7363\u306e\u6a29\u80fd, J\u016b no Ken'n\u014d) is an Anti-Humanity\u00a0(\u5bfe\u4eba\u985e, Tai-Jinrui) Skill used as the Class Skill of the Beast class.Avenger  Avenger\u00a0(\u5fa9\u8b90\u8005, Fukush\u016b-sha) is a Class Skill of the Avenger class, representing the state of an Avenger as one that gathers people's hatreds and grudges onto oneself.

At higher ranks, it is also possible to remain for extended periods of time in this world without an established contract. It is both useful and troublesome depending on the disposition of the Servant and the rank of Independent Action. Acting in autonomy from the Master's Magical Energy supply, the Master can concentrate their own Magical Energy on large spells, or the Servant will be fine even in the case they cannot supply Magical Energy due to injury. The downside is that they can be harder to control and keep by their side, making the only true way to command them is by utilizing Command Spells.Independent Manifestation  Independent Manifestation\u00a0(\u5358\u72ec\u9855\u73fe, Tandoku Kengen) is a special Skill that permits unsupported manifestation into reality, without necessity of energy cost or of summoning by a Master; effectively, the Skill serves as an enhanced version of Independent Action.

He is an abnormal Servant that is not part of the regular seven classes, whose true identity is Angra Mainyu. While he was not actually the evil god of Zoroastrianism, his defeat in the Third War corrupted the Grail, turning it into the equivalent of All the World's Evil. He acts as the Servant of Bazett Fraga McRemitz in place of Lancer in the four day loop of Fate/hollow ataraxia. He is one of the Servants able to be summoned by Ritsuka Fujimaru in the Grand Orders of Fate/Grand Order.Profile Identity  Avenger's True Name is A\u014bra Mainiiu (Angra Mainyu)\u00a0(\u30a2\u30f3\u30ea\u30de\u30e6, Anrimayu), originally believed to be the Persian god of darkness himself. In reality, he was no more than an ordinary villager. A human that was freed from the confines of Order by having his name expelled from the Avesta, The Universal Revelation of Inscribed Creation. One day, he was randomly chosen as the \"source of all evil in the world\" by his village and was tortured and sacrificed in the ensuing rituals. The villagers, who were suffering from various disasters, eventually came to need a scapegoat for blaming their troubles onto. This scapegoat would be designated to be a daemon and be chosen to be the reason for all the calamities afflicting the village. Simultaneously, he would be chosen to be the source of all the world's evil and by his existence, the villagers would have to be good by nature. So they continuously tortured him until he went insane. They captured him, beat him, carved every word that cursed mankind onto his body, forced every sin imaginable upon him, took out bits and pieces of him slowly, defiled his mind with absolute evil, and held him responsible for all of it in the world. They would not allow him to die until he succumbed to old age. He had a curse put on him as a result, one made of the great evil that he was to represent. He was shocked at first at the senselessness of it at all. Eventually he started wondering who it was he should hate. However, Avenger himself only felt anger and hatred towards the world and the people that mercilessly executed him. His forced sacrifice eased the confused minds of his people, which despite being unintentional, qualified him to become a Heroic Spirit. He only despised mankind of his own accord during the first few years, but after that, the hate became a natural function for him rather than an emotion; hate was the state he was always in, so it was only natural for him to continue hating everything without any other reason. By that time, he forgave and tolerated humanity for whatever sins they may cause while hating them. The world is worth hating. The imbalances were evened out by his hatred, so the people could be absolved of all guilt and live freely. But that kind of \"forgiveness\" is also the same type that validates any good or evil that humans may perform. Yet as the time passed by and he saw many rises and fall of generations, he realized that while he still hated humans for what they did, he still loved the world. Of course, the people that put him up there, his family, his loved ones, the people he hated, died long before he did. The village changed over the generations, expanding, declining; people reviled him, people feared him, people scorned him, and yet they revered him as the sign of their salvation. But he could do nothing but hate, since that was the only thing he could communicate to the world. In the end, he accepted his role for humanity, even if it meant to be the blame for their wrongdoings. As he watched the world for millennia, his name, his body, and his soul eroded away, leaving only his raw emotion of hatred behind. This hatred still remains watching the human world and will do so until its very end. A helpless sacrifice\u2014an ordinary person without any special talent\u2014that transformed into exactly what they wanted, that was determined to be and came to represent All the World's Evil. And thus, hated by everyone and losing his self, a hero was born.Background  He was summoned during in the Third Grail war by the Einzbern family. The only Avenger Class Servant summoned was during the Third Holy Grail War, and rather than a true Heroic Spirit, an Anti-Hero was summoned. The Angra Mainyu that was summoned was a nameless figure merely crowned with the name of the 'King of Daemons' who bore the six billion curses of the world. Angra Mainyu was to be a living calamity that would be able to win the Holy Grail War by brute force, as opposed to if the Einzberns summoned a Servant of the Ruler Class. Replacing the Berserker class for the War, the class was a special container created only for him, but he was extremely weak instead of something capable of slaughtering all other Masters and Servants. He was quickly killed in four days and was trapped in the wish-granting spiritual Holy Grail. The power of the Grail as a wish granter received the wishes that humanity had placed on Angra Mainyu and turned him into a real daemon who would be the source of All the World's Evil. Angra Mainyu was to be born, with the Greater Grail as a uterus, as an embodiment of the Third Magic. His influence tainted the Grail system. Originally the Grail system can summon only \"good\" Heroic Spirits, however due to his corruption caused the fourth and fifth Wars to summon irregular spirits. Avenger himself is \"a Heroic Spirit born into existence according to people's wishes\". Other Heroic Spirits are recognized as true heroes, but Avenger represents the belief that \"heroes\" are lies and fabrications. The enshrinement of humanity's selfish desires turned Avenger into a Heroic Spirit, creating a direct connection to the wish-granting function of the Holy Grail. The Greater Grail, \"activated 3 times without granting anyone's wishes\", turned into its present state as there was still a chance to grant somebody's wish. As a result, Avenger was born into this world in order to grant everybody's desire for an existence like \"All the World's Evil (Angra Mainyu)\". Despite having been a normal, powerless being prior, the wish engraved in his soul by those who desired him to represent all the evils in the world was granted. Thus, the purpose of the 4th War was simply to gather vast amounts of mana to grant the wish.Appearance  Avenger does not have a \"true\" appearance since he is nothingness itself. In his original state, he possesses no personality and no appearance. It is only by possessing others as his shell that he is able to acquire an appearance and a personality based on his host. As he begins to return to his original state of nothingness, he begins to lose his physical features and look like a shadow. In Fate/Zero, he used the form of Irisviel von Einzbern to communicate with Kiritsugu Emiya. His scorching mud had dyed her elegant skirt black. In Fate/hollow ataraxia, Avenger takes on the form of Shirou Emiya. As Avenger, his overall appearance is based on Shirou but with darker skin, black hair, and glyphs tattooed all over his body. His clothing consists of a tattered red waist cloth, a bandana of same color, and black bandages on his forearms and shins. Furthermore, Caren and Bazett use oil paints to paint Shirou as Avenger in the Bonus epilogue, they both claim that they look identical. According to character toy and Chibichuki, he wear a red fundoshi under his waist cloth.Personality  Originally he was a good-natured young man before he was randomly chosen to be the \"source\" of his village's evil and tortured until death. His hatred for the world became his very nature but he forgave humanity and accepted it, both good and evil. As nothingness, he no longer has any personality unless he possesses a host body. In hollow ataraxia, Avenger usually has a lazy and laid-back attitude, lacking any sense of justice. This is best shown when he decides to kill innocent people in order to attract the attention of a Master and their Servant (since he believed it was the easiest way). He is also known to be sarcastic, cynical and mercilessly mocking towards the people he interacts with.Role Fate/Zero  Angra Mainyu, in his Grail-altered form as All the World's Evil, reacts to Kiritsugu Emiya's statement \"For that, even if I am to carry 'all the evils of this world' \u2013 it won't matter. If that can save the world, then I'd gladly accept it.\" while he is arguing with Saber after the deaths of Lancer,\u00a0Kayneth Archibald El-Melloi\u00a0and Sola-Ui Nuada-Re Sophia-Ri. Hearing that it has been called by someone, it wishes to answer him as soon as possible. While waiting for the \"birth canal\", the Holy Grail, to open, it dreams of the cries that will dye the world crimson red. After Irisviel von Einzbern's death, Avenger records her personality at the time that the soul and conscience of Irisviel merged with the Greater Grail in order to use it as a shell to communicate with Kiritsugu. Avenger, now as Irisviel, claims that the record is unmistakably genuine, as the last thing that she touched before her demise was All the World's Evil. It inherited Irisviel's last desire by personifying her wish to \"remain this way.\" During the final battle between Kiritsugu and Kirei Kotomine, the Grail gushes out black mud which engulfed both of them. Though both of them entered in a dream like state, the Grail recognizes Kiritsugu as the victor. Avenger uses Irisviel to confront Kiritsugu in his mind and asks his wish, however it comes with a heavy price. In his mind, he was forced to confront the fact that his methods who practiced in all his life will eventually lead to him becoming the ultimate enemy of all humanity, equal to Angra Mainyu itself - and, 'Irisviel' proclaimed, this path is correct. Kiritsugu, now realizing that the Grail is corrupted, shoots down all his loved ones including the illusions of his wife and daughter. As he rejected and strangled 'Irisviel', Avenger placed a curse on him - to never be free of regret until his painful death. Kirei, having went through the same experience, questioned Kiritsugu why he rejected the Grail; Kiritsugu's answer was that it sacrifices too many things for what it gives. Kirei says that he wanted it even so and Kiritsugu, admitting that he did not understand Kirei, shot him in the heart. In Kirei's last moments, the Holy Grail appeared to him in his mind. Filled with hatred and envy for Kiritsugu, Kirei reached out and touched the cursed artifact. He prayed for an end to humanity before of his death and his wish was granted in the form of fire. Meanwhile, Avenger's emergence was prevented by Kiritsugu, who commanded his servant, Saber, to destroy the Grail upon recognizing the evil presence emanating from it. However, she destroyed only the vessel and not the contents - the 'black mud' - which spilled out from its core onto the streets below and caused a fire that eventually destroyed a large part of Shinto. The black ichor managed to soak Kirei's lifeless body, resurrecting him with an artificial, black heart. Gilgamesh was covered and absorbed into the black mud that poured out when Saber destroyed the Grail's vessel. In the original novel, there was a scene where Gilgamesh contacted Avenger inside of black mud that came out of the Grail. Avenger reveals the ugliness and hatred of the world, but to his surprise Gilgamesh accepts this and acknowledges his role in carrying the burden of the world. Gilgamesh's strong ego helps him fight off Avenger's influence and the black mud ejects Gilgamesh. Kirei wakes up and finds Gilgamesh near him. He seemed to have gained a flesh body from something that flowed to his body through the Master and Servant connection.Einzbern Consultation Room  Avenger appears briefly in the Einzbern Consultation Room, a metafiction segment not part of the actual timeline of Fate/Zero. Zecchan somehow entered the Grail. The Shades that Avenger manifested were chasing after Zecchan, but were stopped by his void-like figure. Avenger would order the Shades to attack Zecchan, but Irisviel would appear and save her from the Shades by cutting them down with her Naginata. Zecchan tried to escape with Irisviel, she encouraged Irisviel to leave the Holy Grail by telling her she believes her to be a champion of justice. While running away Zecchan encounters Avenger. His body turned out to be an exit and Irisviel finally understood that Zecchan is from a different time period.Fate/Grand Order  Avenger is a No-Star Servant that can be summoned by the Protagonist. True to his Star rarity, he is the weakest Servant unable to triumph against his enemy alone.Fate/Accel Zero Order  After the defeat of Black Iri, Assassin calls out Angra Mainyu from the Large Cavity. Angra Mainyu remembers him, and the two fight each other.Fate/hollow ataraxia  The physical vessel for the Grail was destroyed by Shirou Emiya and Saber, along with the contents to prevent the disaster to be brought by the presence of Avenger in form of \"All World's Evils\". However, the soul of Avenger\u00a0had become a real daemon due to the wishes placed upon him being granted by the Greater Grail. Wanting to grant the wishes of mankind as per his own nature as a daemon, he was reborn and transformed in a Heroic Spirit capable of fulfilling desires through the power of the Grail.\u00a0After finally being able to grant a wish though and\u00a0his soul disconnected from the Greater Grail with the destruction of its physical vessel, Avenger was left to expire without accomplishing his role. Having become a weak Grail with the destruction of its physical vessel\u00a0and his soul seperated of\u00a0Greater Grail in process, Avenger\u00a0being only in his spiritual form began searching for someone whose wish he could grant in order to do what it was born to do. In the process, he found Bazett, who after being left to die for Kirei days ago, wished hard that she did not want to die. Therefore, they made a contract: Avenger, to continue to exist and accomplish its new role of granting a wish, and Bazett, to stay alive even in a vegetative state.\u00a0To keep Bazett alive after entering into her soul and mind to fulfill her desire to continue to live, Avenger created a dream world in her mind using the memories of Fuyuki and his inhabitants that he obtained through Shirou when Kirei Kotomine tried to use his curse to tried destroy and kill him in his final fight.\u00a0As a result, Bazett's body went into a coma. However, 6 months after the 5th war in real world, Caren came to Fuyuki city, found and nursed the dying Bazett in mansion. Unlike before, when Avenger just had to keep her physical signs alive, now he had to keep both Bazett's now awake consciousness and body alive. In order to accomplish that, he created the four-day temporal loop. To keep Bazett thinking that she was still participating in Holy Grail War,\u00a0Avenger recreated the 5th Grail War. The problem, however, was that he never personally experienced the 5th war. He only knew of the 3rd war. So he just took the participants of the 5th war and used them to create the characters in the 3rd war to play the 5th war's events. While he was Bazett's Servant Avenger by night, he took on the form of Shirou by day. As Shirou, he comes to care for other people, especially the mysterious Caren Hortensia. In this form, he has no idea of his own identity and thinks and acts like Shirou. He later explains that this is because Avenger himself is 0, and no matter how much you add 0 to 1, it is still 1. The problem starts when (1) Shirou, in truth Avenger, realizes the temporal loop and tries to solve the anomaly, and (2) Avenger himself begins to keep \"filling up\" the Grail to see more and more new events. Since Shirou is someone who cannot let the wrong stay wrong, he had to fix the abnormal temporal loop. Also, even though he knew that by seeking new events he would complete the Grail thus ending the loop, which would ultimately mean his return to void, Avenger could not stop enjoying the happy daily life as Shirou. Later Bazett realizes the false reality of the temporal loop, but refuses to finish it. She thinks that she would die once the loop is over, but she also knew that would permanently take Avenger to nothingness. In her hope to stay alive, and her wish to keep Avenger from his ultimate fate, she tries to continue the loop, even if it means going against Avenger himself.\u00a0During one of last loops, Bazett uses a Command Spell to make Avenger 'become her left arm' in order to keep him from contacting Shirou directly. With help from Caren, the only one whom Shirou has never met and thus Avenger reveals his true self, Shirou/Avenger finally realizes that he himself is the cause of all the problem, and decides to put the end to it. He finally reaches the Grail as the other Servants and Masters prevent the monsters (which are actually leftover parts of Avenger) from stopping him. In the end, Avenger frees Bazett from the loop and returns to the void. In the process, it is revealed that while the reproduced Holy Grail War itself was due to the wish of Bazett, the daily life that Shirou experienced was due to Avenger's own wish to live a normal life. After Bazett awaken from his coma in the real world with the end of the world loop in his mind and obtaining an artificial arm to replace her missing one, both she and Caren speak of the arm as if it is still Avenger.Fate/tiger colosseum Upper  In Irisviel's story, Archer and Avenger are seen in the Emiya residence. Irisviel (which is an Irisviel of a parallel world that was brought by accident by Avenger and Neco-Arc for letting the Zelretch chest that they took from the Tohsaka residence at the beginning of Irisviel's story stay open) identifies Avenger as someone she once knew. With Archer, Avenger and Shirou arguing, Magical Caren tells Irisviel that they are all Kiritsugu's sons. Irisviel, shocked with this revelation, decides to take action as a mother. She lectures them about how brothers should take care of each other. She greets Avenger and calls him Angra Mainyu. Avenger replies that \"It's been a while\", although they haven't met in his current state. Irisviel was surprised to see Angra Mainyu as her son in this world and she is glad to see Avenger finally happy. Avenger claims that his body is of a hopeless ordinary man, but he is grateful to him.Capsule Servant  Avenger is encountered in Bazett's story in Rin's route. After Rin picks up Lancer, Avenger calls out to her for help. Rin was surprised when Avenger spoke. Avenger almost introduces himself as Angra Mainyu, and tells Rin that he is able to talk because he is a lucky one. Bazett appears and orders Avenger to return to her capsule. In actuality, she wants Avenger back because Avenger is her only friend, but instead she claims that lucky talking Servants are illegal. These Servants are designated to be sealed, and the Mage's Association dispatched her to recover that Servant. Avenger yells out to Bazett, calling her a liar and a terrible person who abuses her Capsule Servant. He says that Bazett makes him go shopping, clean, and take her phone calls. He also complains about Bazett constantly feeding him beef bowl for breakfast, lunch and dinner which drove him to the height of insanity. His complaints make Bazett appear to be a lonely woman whose only friend is a Servant. Bazett tries to prove she has friends by showing the contact list on her phone. However, Avenger points out the that those on the list are all business contacts and Bazett, angered by this, challenges Rin. After Bazett's defeat, she reveals she doesn't have a single friend and Avenger is her only friend. Both Rin and Avenger feel guilty, and Rin asks Avenger to return to Bazett. Avenger agrees, saying that they both bullied Bazett a bit too hard and it leaves a bad aftertaste. Bazett asks Avenger to return as friends. Rin questions why Bazett wants Avenger so badly, Bazett replies that she would rather have Lancer because she keeps getting doubles of Avenger. Rin decides to give Lancer to Bazett, and to her surprise, Lancer is a lucky talking Servant. Lancer tries to convince Rin that she can't trade him away and they are compatible like a dream team, to no avail. Bazett was happy to trade Avenger for Lancer as she claims Avenger to be rude and super weak. As both Lancer and Avenger try to convince their Masters not to trade, Avenger remarks that he expected the story to be a heartwarming story.Chibichuki!  Avenger is a school \"prankster\". Due to the similar appearance with Shirou, Taiga Fujimura mistakes him for Shirou and he ends up getting educational guidance lectures.Other appearances  Avenger makes a brief cameo appearance in the last episode of Carnival Phantasm, he also appears in a glimpse in the EX season episode. In the Fate/Apocrypha universe, the Einzbern during in the Third Holy Grail War had two options to pick their Servant. The first option was to alter the system of the Greater Grail itself and summon Angra Mainyu to a unique Avenger-class Servant. The second option was to abuse one of the systems installed in the Greater Grail by summoning Amakusa Shirou Tokisada as the ultimate Ruler-class Servant, meant to be an impartial authority whom regulated the progress of the War. They would then make use of the great privilege possessed by Ruler: its Command Spells for the other Servants. They were in conflict between choosing brawn or brains. After much contemplation, the Einzberns chose Ruler. One could say that they picked the safer option; perhaps their previous defeat had robbed them of their confidence in powers higher than they. Unlike Avenger, Ruler was the last servant to survive in the Third Holy Grail War and he survived for the next sixty years. Ruler wished for humanity salvation and wished the happiness of all mankind, for innate goodness to be found in the heart of all humanity and the annihilation of Angra Mainyu: All the Evils of the World. In the Fate/Extra universe, Angra Mainyu/CCC is the anti-planetary Noble Phantasm of the demon-transformed Kiara Sessyoin. Her existence is similar to Avenger who had once been demonized and celebrated as a sacrifice to prove the evil of mankind. In Type-Moon's April Fools' Day 2009, moon.cinemas.jp is a fake movie theater site listing a number of parody films. He was featured in Mysterious Planet An Sa Ra\u00a0(\u4e0d\u601d\u8b70\u60d1\u661f\u30a2\u30f3\u30fb\u30b5\u30fb\u30e9, Fushigi Wakusei An Sa Ra).Abilities  Avenger was a regular human worshipped as a Heroic Spirit in life and considered to be Angra Mainyu, but he became a \"mere human\" again after his death. Despite such religious faith being placed upon him, he did not gain any unique abilities as a Heroic Spirit other than becoming free from the laws of order due to having his name stricken from Avesta, but that quality is not enough to be able to truly label him a Heroic Spirit. He is considered to have been garbage during the Third Holy Grail War, completely powerless and without any Noble Phantasms. He is only able to become the Heroic Spirit others wished for upon entering the Holy Grail, fulfilling the wishes piled upon him and truly becoming All the World's Evils. Within the recreation of the Fifth Holy Grail War, he has changed somewhat from the Servant serving the Einzbern Master, displaying a Noble Phantasm and having some use to Bazett despite his weakness. He declares himself to be the weakest of all legends in the world, boasting that he is \"number one\" in that regard, says that his Servant skill is \"nothing\", and believes even Bazett outstrips him in fighting ability. He wields Tawrich: The Left Fang Grinder\u00a0(, ) and Zarich: The Right Fang Grinder\u00a0(, ), a pair of reverse grip weapons fashioned in the shape of a mix between a beast's fangs and claws. They were likely worshipped as real daemon's fangs and used in rituals during the era they were made. Brutish weapons varying greatly in size and shape, they are similar in form to throwing daggers originally crafted by the Azande or Ubangi tribes of Africa. As often with short swords, they are meant to be used as sword-breakers to stop an opponent's blade rather than rend flesh; one is able to catch a blade, while the other is used to attack. As they are not Noble Phantasms, it is possible to break them in the case of Saber easily doing so using Mana Burst to smash both with one swing. When acting as Shirou and properly meeting Caren for the first time, he projects a large number of them due to his compatibility with them, using them with great efficiency and shooting them as spinning projectiles. He cannot keep up with other Servants with his low-ranking abilities, and a fight of pure ability with one will only lead to his exhaustion before losing. While he says that his combat ability amounts to nothing, he still believes he can buy time against a Servant. He uses a fighting style that will not allow him to win, but not cause him to lose even while surrounded by enemies. Bazett believes the reason that he can fight defensively extremely well while retaining his composure is due to being \"unkillable\" from the four day loop. Upon becoming Angra Mainyu, he was instilled with an instinctual knowledge related to the \"rules\" in his role as All the World's Evils. Despite being the weakest of Heroic Spirits, he, as All the World's Evil, can defeat even the most powerful human being. He is the strongest at \"dealing with humans\", not in the least scared of even a fictitious \"strongest ultra humanoid in all of human history who has powers that surpass a Heroic Spirit.\" While almost useless in battle against Servants, his \"natural inclinations\" make him the second or third in ability to kill humans en masse. While he would normally be number one in that regard, he says the dog and the spider are better at murdering than him. While having never met them or competed with them, his innate knowledge lets him know that he can keep up in quality but pales in comparison to the speed with which they are able to kill.Unlimited Raise Dead  Unlimited Raise Dead: Infinite Remains\u00a0(, ) is the four day loop caused by his abilities. He initially lets Bazett believe that it is his Noble Phantasm. She believes the reason for his lack of strength in battle is due it being a weakness for having a Noble Phantasm that alters and interferes with destiny. He tells her that it has no cost due to emptiness being his nature, allowing him to resurrect in the evening as long as there is nothingness. With the death of Bazett or the end of the fourth night at midnight, the \"abnormal returns to normal\" as the curtains close on the battle. What should not have been possible returns to the void from which it came, obliterating the four days without a trace and erasing the past as the new day begins.Shade  Shade\u00a0(\u9ab8, Mukuro) is the form that the remains of Avenger take in the looped world of Fate/hollow ataraxia after he is defeated: a shadowy void that is barely shaped like a wolf-man. Similar to daemons, though much weaker in power. Still strong enough to slaughter any normal human, while someone with 10 years-worth of martial arts training might be able to last a few seconds in a one-on-one fight. The real problem is that it appears in massive numbers, having been born from a spiritual disruption meant to \"create the same kind of monster\".Development  Despite hollow ataraxia not having been completely worked out at the time of Fate/Zero's development period, Gen Urobuchi was able to get the mechanics behind Avenger's method of \"possession\" by chance.Reception References Rin Tohsaka  Rin Tohsaka\u00a0(\u9060\u5742 \u51db, T\u014dsaka Rin) is one of the three main heroines of Fate/stay night who acts as the Master of Archer in the Fifth Holy Grail War. Rin is the heroine of the Unlimited Blade Works route in Fate/stay night.Profile Background  Two centuries ago, the Tohsaka House, in collaboration with the estates of Makiri and Einzbern, helped found the Fuyuki Holy Grail Wars. The land of Fuyuki City, which possessed the second greatest spiritual power in all Japan, was owned by Rin's ancestor, Nagato Tohsaka; at the behest of the Einzberns, he provided his property as battleground for present and future wars. Nagato was a kirishitan, as well as a pupil of Zelretch; these titles gave him considerable influence in both the Mage's Association and the Church, allowing the Tohsaka family to participate in the Holy Grail Wars, free from harassment by either organization. Rin was brought up as the successor to her family's magecraft, and was instructed by her father to prioritize magecraft over her own interests. Ten years ago, Tokiomi Tohsaka was selected as a Master in the 4th Holy Grail War, and Rin was entrusted to take care of the Tohsaka estate until his return. Her mother, Aoi Tohsaka, was left in a debilitated state from the war, so her care was left to her guardian, Kirei Kotomine. After her father was killed, Rin continued to improve her sorcery with some guidance from Kirei Kotomine. To divert attention from her private life, Rin has diligently strived to earn the admiration of her peers, even though she is secretly stingy, tomboyish, and a perfectionist. The rights to the Tohsaka lands were inherited by Aoi after Tokiomi's death, and subsequently inherited by Rin after Aoi's death. Kirei managed them as Rin's guardian, and because of his foolhardy and coarse management, the majority of profitable properties ended up in the hands of others. It is possible that he believed the wealth was bad for her upbringing due to following the principles of humility and poverty. Although Rin resents the sacrifices she has endured for the sake of tradition, she is fiercely competitive and eager to prove herself as a skilled and capable magus. She was immensely disappointed at summoning Archer and ended up in a quarrel with him; however, the duo soon reconciled, set aside their differences and quickly got along.Appearance  Rin is a young woman with aqua eyes and long wavy black hair, which she styles with flanking twin-tails tied with black ribbons. During school, she wears the standard Homurahara uniform, which she sometimes accompanies with a long red coat. Her casual clothing consists of a red turtleneck, a black skirt and long black socks under brown leather flats. When she was young, her clothing consisted of a white shirt with a red necktie, a red skirt and long black socks, much like when she becomes older. In the fifth Holy Grail War, she prepared a plain skirt and shirt for Saber, though it was originally a birthday present from Kirei. As an adult, she put down her hair. Two years after the Heaven's Feel route ending, she wears a long sleeve red shirt and a long maroon skirt. Her alternative costume is a long red jacket, a white polo neck jumper, a black mini skirt and long leather boots.Personality  Rin is a perceptive, serious, resourceful and very competitive person. Though she is widely admired at school as a prim and proper honor student, it is a front she puts up in order to prevent others from prying into her life. In private, she is notably loud, shrewd, stingy and bossy, but usually means well for those she cares about. She is known as a model student and idol of her school. Her manner of speech is often hostile and dismissive of other people, but deep down she has a caring, big-sisterly disposition. Her tendency of making trivial mistakes at the worst possible moment is a hereditary curse. Though she really is a lot nicer than she seems, she claims to always make her decisions based on cold, rational logic in the end. In her own words, it's \"not a very cute personality\". In fact, her choice in personal clothes is probably an overreaction to that. Despite claiming that she would do anything in order to win the Holy Grail War, no matter how underhanded, she has a deeply rooted sense of honor, seen refusing to dispose of Shirou despite numerous easy chances of doing so, simply because she owes him and deem disposing of him without clearing her debts to be cheap. In short, Rin is a tough, fiery, perceptive, judicious,\u00a0and considerably aggressive tsundere who shows both sides of the trope.\u00a0 During her childhood, she understood the Fourth Holy Grail War about as much as Shirou understands the Fifth, seemingly understanding while not actually comprehending it. She saw her father as a great magus who must be respected and loved, but failed to understand the negative aspect of his personality, the coldheartedness that accompanied such an ideal. If he had lived until Rin could actually understand his personality, it is likely that it would have greatly affected the development of her own personality. It is unknown if she would have opposed such inhumanity and left the path of a magus, or if she would have become a \u201cperfect and coldhearted\u201d magus like her father. Either fate for Rin would have been one far away from happiness. Due to Tokiomi's early and untimely death, she was not aware of the original goal of the Holy Grail War to open a \u201chole\u201d beyond the World. For the sake of her deceased father and her family's name, Rin seeks to obtain the Holy Grail, though she has little personal desire for it. Unbeknownst to her sister Sakura, Rin feels guilty and believes that she has abandoned Sakura after she is adopted into the Matou household, so much the guilt was what driven her to revive Shirou, Sakura's target of affection, at the brink of death. While Rin eventually admits that she has always watched Sakura from afar, she never realized how much Sakura suffered under the Matou and fooled herself into thinking Sakura was happy to alleviate her own guilt. She spent just as much time quarrelling with Shirou as she did cooperating with him. She's a mischievous girl at heart, so she loves teasing serious people such as Shirou. However, Rin did want to kill him when she saw his Gradation Air in his shed, thinking that he lied to her. Although she claimed to be not interested in anyone, the Heaven's Feel scenario revealed that Rin has been attracted to Shirou after witnessing his stubborn attempts to finish a high jump that he had no chance of finishing when they were younger. Rin was very supportive of Shirou's relationship with Saber in the Fate route. In the Unlimited Blade Works, they became aware of their mutual crush and attraction which developed to love. In Heaven's Feel, Rin reveals her attraction to Shirou while giving advice for Sakura and their closeness makes Sakura jealous and resentful of Rin. Her hobbies include admiring jewels. Although wealthy from her family's magical patents, she feels somewhat ashamed of having to rely on the work of previous generations.Role Fate/Zero  Rin appears as a minor character in Fate/Zero. She first appeared when Kariya Matou visited her and her mother Aoi. During Kariya and Aoi's conversation, it is revealed that Sakura was sent to the Matou family, an incident which deeply upset Rin and she avoids speaking of it. Shortly before the war begins, Rin's father Tokiomi acquires Kirei Kotomine as a student. Despite her father's confidence in his abilities, Rin is wary of Kotomine, going so far as questioning him to determine if she can trust him to protect her father, and decides she just can't like people like him when he doesn't give her the response she wants to hear. Ironically, Kirei would be the one to murder her father later on. Throughout the Fourth Grail War, Rin and Aoi reside with Rin's maternal grandparents outside of Fuyuki City for their own personal safety. When children begin disappearing from Fuyuki City as a result of Ryuunosuke Uryuu and Caster kidnapping them, Rin sets out on her own to find one of the missing children, a girl named Kotone whom Rin was friends with. Using her elementary magic skills and a magical compass from her father, Rin's attempt goes awry and she winds up lost and in danger of being attacked by Caster's monsters. Her mother finds her shortly after Rin is saved by Kariya, though Rin fainted soon after seeing the terrible changes to Kariya's face. The anime expands Rin's short adventure, resulting in her meeting Ryuunosuke Uryuu in person and freeing the children he kidnapped. While escaping, she is attacked by Caster's Horror, though she is saved by Kariya. The incident concludes as it did in the novel, where Rin faints and Kariya brings her to a park where Aoi finds them. When Tokiomi visits his wife and daughter one last time before the conclusion of the war, he presents Rin with a book, as well as advice and encouragement for her to become a powerful magus. The meeting would be the last time Rin ever saw her father before his death. Prior to his demise, Tokiomi arranges for Kotomine Kirei to become her guardian and teacher until she comes of age. Rin's final appearance occurs in the epilogue of the series, during the funeral of her father. Thanks to Tokiomi's careful preparations, she has already obtained most of her family's crest and has become the next head of the Tohsaka family despite her young age. Rin shows no visible distress at her father's death, even as she is forced to care for her mother, who suffers from brain damage and still believes that Sakura and Tokiomi are with her, leaving Rin to feel lonely within her own home. Kirei, in hopes of eliciting an unhappy reaction from Rin, gives her the Azoth Sword, telling her that her father had given it to him but omitting that he had used it to kill Tokiomi; to Kotomine's secret delight, Rin is overcome with emotion and weeps.Fate/stay night  Rin is the protagonist of the prologue of Fate/stay night Unlimited Blade Works, detailing her first three days involved in the 5th Holy Grail War. In her dialogues, she reveals to her Servant Archer that she is only participating in the war out of her own competitive desire to become the winner. She also expresses dissatisfaction with Archer, for she was attempting to summon a Saber-class Servant, though she quickly grows accustomed to him. After scouting out Fuyuki City, Rin. is caught off-guard at Homurahara Academy by Lancer, who then engages in battle with Archer. This fight is interrupted, however, when Shirou Emiya is discovered and fatally wounded by Lancer; Rin, who felt sympathy for Shirou - and Sakura (in UBW) -, used her family's treasured pendant, which possessed a strong concentration of Mana, to repair his heart. After she returns home, she realizes Lancer will continue to hunt Shirou when he discovers that Shirou is not dead, prompting her to sprint toward Shirou's neighborhood. It is here that she first encountered Saber, and the three Fate/stay night scenarios branch off. In all three scenarios, Rin helps and allies with Shirou. By the conclusion of the prologue, Rin would have used two Command Seals on Archer; the first is to force him into submission after he acts insubordinately to her after he is summoned. The second is to force him into ethereal form before he is killed by Saber, except for the Unlimited Blade Works path where Shirou uses a Command Spell to stop Saber's attack instead. In all scenarios, her position as protagonist is given to Shirou.Fate  Rin acts as an advisor to Shirou, dutifully attempting to school him in traditional sorcery in light of his powerful Servant, Saber. Although Shirou's recklessness results in the death of Archer, she bears Shirou no ill-will, though she hides bitterness at her loss of both her Servant and her chance at winning the war. Rin is later badly injured by Kotomine in Shirou's home while trying to protect Illya, though she is saved by the arrival of Shirou before giving him the Azoth Sword which she got from Kotomine as a child ten years prior (which he got from Rin's father and used it to murder him in turn with). Ultimately, she\u00a0survives and ultimately leaves for London after the war to become a true magus (where as she stays in Fuyuki to train in the\u00a0anime).Unlimited Blade Works  After learning that Shirou is a complete novice, Rin takes him to Kotomine Church and introduces him to Kirei so that he can have the Holy Grail War explained to him, believing she owed him that much. Upon leaving, they are attacked by Ilya and her Servant, Berserker, forcing both teams to work together. The fight leaves Shirou wounded, and Rin helps Saber get him home, staying to make sure his injuries are healed before making to leave. When Shirou tries to thank her, she reminds him that the Holy Grail War is a fight to the death and the next time they meet, it will be as enemies. The next day, Shirou shows up for school as he normally would and angers Rin, who feels he's ignored her warning. While looking for the source of the school's barrier, she comes across Shirou again. She immediately switches her attention, deciding to make good on her threat on sight. Rin launches her assault, relentlessly pursuing Shirou with the intent to kill him unless he surrenders Saber's Command Spells. She is interrupted at the last moment by the sudden appearance of Rider, who attacks a student. Shirou and Rin promptly team up to drive Rider away and call a truce. Forming an alliance, they begin searching for possible candidates for Rider's Master. Shirou finds himself whisked away to Ryuudou Temple by Caster, who also wishes to take away his Command Spells. Archer interrupts and saves Shirou while Saber confronts Assassin. It is at this moment that Shirou starts to get even more irritated by Archer, who has looked down on his ideals. Archer then attacks Shirou, but is stopped by Saber and Assassin. While they are fighting at Ryuudou Temple, Rin begins to have dreams about Archer and his past as a hero who was betrayed by his ideals. After she finds out about Archer going to the temple to kill Shirou, Rin apologizes to Shirou for Archer's actions and tells him that she used a Command Spell to order Archer to never attack Shirou. The following day, Shinji Matou reveals himself as Rider's Master when he has her use Blood Fort Andromeda to attack the school and everyone in it. A second Servant attacks at the same time, and Saber is summoned. While she fights the Servant, who turns out to be Caster, Rin and Shirou fight their way through golems to get to Rider and stop her. They arrive only to find she's already been killed, though Shinji runs away without telling them who killed her. With Rider defeated, Rin and Shirou's focus shifts to uncovering the identity of Caster's Master, suspecting that it has to be someone else from the school. When it seems that it might be a teacher, Souichirou Kuzuki, Rin takes the lead and plans an ambush to reveal his identity as a Master or not. Since Archer had suggested they ally with Caster instead of Shirou, Rin decides to leave him behind and only bring Shirou and Saber, not wanting Archer to be around Caster and thinking Saber would be more than enough to handle the situation. The plan works initially, confirming Kuzuki's role as Caster's Master, but things quickly sour when he and Caster fight back. Nearly overwhelmed by their combined strength, they are saved only by the surprise of Shirou's projection attacks and Kuzuki's call to retreat rather than fight further. In order to make it easier to plan and strategize, Rin comes to stay at Shirou's house. In response to a conversation they had the night before that made Rin realize Shirou doesn't do anything for himself and his own enjoyment, Rin takes Shirou on a date packed with fun-filled activities the next day, bringing Saber along. Upon returning home, they find Caster holding Taiga as hostage. When Shirou tries to follow her demands, Caster releases Taiga and strikes Saber with Rule Breaker, transferring Shirou's Command Spells to her. Against her will, Saber is forced to attack Rin and Shirou is stabbed through the shoulder when he tries to protect her. At Saber's urging, Shirou and Rin leave; in the anime, Archer arrives to help them, and with his aid they are able to get away without further incident. With his Command Spells gone, Rin declares that she will fight Kuzuki and Caster with only Archer, despite Shirou's protests. Shirou follows Rin and witnesses her confronting Kuzuki and Caster in Kotomine Church, their new base of operations. To her shock, Archer suddenly betrays Rin and attacks her. Shirou saves her and, although she is reluctant, she eventually thanks him and accepts his help again. With Archer gone, both decide to ask Ilya and Berserker for their help. Unfortunately, they arrive too late and find that Shinji and Gilgamesh have already killed them. Lancer shows up shortly afterwards, however, with orders to help them take down Caster if they are willing to cooperate together. Out of options, they accept. They return to the Kotomine Church, where Lancer fights Archer again. Archer admits defeat and retreats into the church. Meanwhile, Shirou and Rin team up to fight Kuzuki and Caster, ending in a stalemate until Rin turns the tables, attacking Caster not with magecraft but martial arts, and nearly killing her. Kuzuki prevents her from delivering the final blow, and Caster tries to use a spell to completely dominate Saber and send her against Shirou and Rin. But before she can, Archer arrives and attacks Kuzuki, killing Caster when she takes the strike for him. Even with both of them defeated, Archer is still not on their side, however, and he reveals his true motives and intent to kill Shirou. Rin makes a new contract with Saber, thereby making her Saber's Master, to stop him. Archer then kidnaps Rin and takes her as a hostage to Einzbern Castle. There, Shinji tries to rape her, despite her warnings that he is just being manipulated. Further, Kirei arrives and reveals his plot to kill Rin and turn her body into the vessel for the Lesser Grail, finally revealing to Rin's fury that he murdered her father as well. She is ultimately rescued by Lancer, who kills Kirei and drives off Shinji before dying himself. Rin makes her way out of the basement and to the upper hall of the castle just in time to see the conclusion of Archer and Shirou's fight. Moments later, Gilgamesh appears and attempts to kill Shirou and Archer both. Archer saves Shirou by pushing him out of the way, falling under the full assault of Gilgamesh's attack and disappearing before Rin's eyes, much to her grief. Gilgamesh reveals the true nature of the Grail to her, Shirou, and Saber, along with his plans to use it to eradicate mankind. Shirou, Rin and Saber go back to the Emiya household to make a plan to stop Gilgamesh and deal with the Grail. After giving Shirou enough mana to access his Reality Marble, they set out and reach Gilgamesh's new hideout, Ryuudou Temple. Rin saves Shinji, who had been used as the Grail's core, fighting off its manifested curses and attempts to pull him back in, even as it tried to swallow them in a mass of flesh. Upon escaping, Rin uses her final Command Spell to order Saber to destroy the Grail. Meanwhile, Shirou successfully defeats Gilgamesh. However, Gilgamesh tries one last time to make him the new incarnation of the Holy Grail. Fortunately, Archer, who also appeared to help Rin at the same time, comes to Shirou's aid. Rin bids her Servant goodbye as Archer tells her to take care of his younger self, hoping that her care for Shirou will change the future and grant his wish to save Shirou from his ideals. In the end, Rin finally sees Archer with a genuine smile, the same one as Shirou's.  In Rin's True Ending, she heads off to the Mages' Association after she graduates, and asks Shirou if he would be willing to travel with her to London as her apprentice so they can stay together and she can watch over him, though they both know he would say yes. Its also established in this ending that they have officially entered into a romantic relationship following the end of the 5th Grail War. In Rin's Good Ending, she keeps Saber as her Servant, and Rin and Shirou live a normal happy life as a couple. Rin is the Winner of the 5th Grail War in this route.Heaven's Feel  In the \"Heaven's Feel\" scenario, Rin reveals to Shirou that Sakura is actually her biological sister who was adopted into the Matou family. Despite her cold words that Sakura must be killed to prevent the Shadow inside her from killing more people, Rin is actually reluctant to kill her sister. In the climax of the route, Rin uses the Jeweled Sword Zelretch to fight Sakura; during the fight, the sisters are finally able to admit how they truly feel towards one another. Though Rin is stabbed, Sakura realizes her sister's love for her and manages to regain control of herself long enough for Shirou to trace Rule Breaker and free her from the Shadow's control. The sisters reconcile in both the Normal and True Ending.Epilogue  Ten years after the end of 5th Holy Grail War (on the Fate and Unlimited Blade Works routes), Lord El-Melloi II arrived in Fuyuki and together with the head of the Tohsaka family, Tohsaka Rin, set out to completely take apart the Great Grail. The Association was planning on bringing back the Great Grail, so the two sides were completely opposed. After the end of the great turmoil of the same magnitude as the Grail War, the Great Grail was completely dismantled and the Grail Wars of Fuyuki came to a complete conclusion.Fate/hollow ataraxia  In the beginning of the game, Rin is away to London to appear before the Mage's Association in a court hearing, for her experiments with Second Magic in the Einzbern Castle. She asked Archer to 'guard' the city in her place. After Sakura sends a letter to Rin (in which Shirou also asked for Rin's help inside), she suddenly returns to Fuyuki. She is the first person that helps Shirou with his suspicion of the 4-day loop. In the final loop, she and Archer fight together in the Fuyuki bridge to stop the horde of shadows from reaching Shirou/Avenger. In her Eclipse scenario, Beginners, Rin invites Shirou into her home to escape the rain. As they are both alone in an empty house, they decide to have sex. Rin establishes \"rules\" to control the safety of their intercourse, but clearly uncomfortable, the mood quickly gets off to a sour start. But Shirou, learning from their previous failures where he got too rough or carried away, becomes determined to make this a pleasant experience for her. Rin's response to the foreplay is immediately positive, with Shirou taking his time to get her into it. His tenderness eventually breaks past her barriers, and uncovers the misplaced fears Rin had that made her too nervous and tense to enjoy their sex in the past. This results in a heart-to-heart that only brings them closer, the mood dramatically improved as they move onto making love. Enjoying it like never before, Rin becomes mushy, confessing her love to Shirou again and again whilst breaking all of her own rules. Upon breaking the last one - the most important one - Shirou fears unwanted conception and Rin's anger turned at him, but is surprised by a fully positive and loving reaction from her. No longer caring about anything else from then on, the happy couple embrace each other, sleeping side by side until the morning. Shirou wakes Rin with affectionate kisses, which she returns, before dashing off to make breakfast and hoping to share more tranquil mornings like these together in their future. \nThis side story is implied to take place after Rin's True Ending.Fate/unlimited codes  She is given the title Elegant Apprentice Mage from a Noble Family\u00a0(\u512a\u96c5\u306a\u308b\u540d\u9580\u9b54\u8853\u5e2b, Y\u016bganaru Meimon Mitarai Majutsushi) in Fate/unlimited codes.Fate/tiger colosseum series  In Fate/tiger colosseum Upper, Rin can transform into Kaleido Ruby\u00a0(\u30ab\u30ec\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb\u30d3\u30fc, Kareido Rub\u012b) and she is part of a group called Magical Four Heavenly Kings\u00a0(\u30de\u30b8\u30ab\u30eb\u56db\u5929\u738b, Majikaru Shiten'n\u014d).Fate/Extra series  In the Fate/Extra world, Rin shares the name as the Rin Tohsaka that appears in the Moon Cell Holy Grail War. They are different people but they are relatives part of the same lineage. Due to Moon Cell fluctuations in Fate/Extra CCC, Rin and Archer appear as an optional boss. Her codecast skills are:Carnival Phantasm  Rin has an active role in Carnival Phantasm due to being one of the heroines of Fate. Her tsundere personality is comically exaggerated and she seems to be obsessed with winning and having more money than she already has. She is also hopeless with electronics to ridiculous lengths. Her alter-ego is the magical girl Kaleido Ruby.Today's Menu for Emiya Family  Rin makes frequent appearances in Today's Menu for Emiya Family, and occasionally cooks the food featured in an episode. Rin's romantic relationship with Shirou is occasionally noted, as seen in Episode 7.Capsule Servant  In Capsule Servant, she is a playable character and appears as her younger self. There is a possible future incarnation of Rin becoming a Heroic Spirit called TOHSAKA\u00a0(\u30c8\u30fc\u30b5\u30ab, T\u014cSAKA). Instead of Heroic Spirit EMIYA, Rin made a contract with the world and became a Counter Guardian. She destroyed the Holy Grail and became Magical Witch\u00a0(\u30de\u30b8\u30ab\u30eb\u30fb\u3046\u3043\u3063\u3061, Majikaru Witchi) TOHSAKA.All Around Type-Moon  Rin appears in the mange series All Around Type-Moon. In one chapter, her inability to handle electronics leads her to accidentally summon Nero directly from the Moon Cell. Later on in the chapter, she also accidentally summons several more characters.Other appearances  She appears in Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA\u2606ILLYA, as a major character. Her counterpart recruits Illya for help. A parallel world version of TYPE-MOON might tell Rin's story in London. In the \"Apocrypha\" universe, the Tohsaka gave up on the Greater Grail. Rin end up becoming the founder of a \"completely new martial arts that combines magecraft and Chinese Kenpou\" by the time she becomes a high school student. In Type-Moon's April Fools' Day 2008, she is a super heavyweight wrestler star known as the Dynamite Rin\u00a0(\u30c0\u30a4\u30ca\u30de\u30a4\u30c8\u51db, Dainamaito Rin) in the T Moon Fighting Spirit\u00a0(T\u30e0\u30fc\u30f3 \u95d8\u9b42, T M\u016bn T\u014dkon). She is the boss of the Fate Wrestling Federation and the leader of the IWGP tag team. Rin is a talented woman who leads a western-style puroresu group. After learning fighting techniques and management at GGG. Rin furthered her knowledge in the field. Rin tends to favor strikes instead of throws. While she is skilled, Rin prefers to turn the fights into a simple match of power vs power, turning the spectacle into a royal road of proresu. As someone who knows how to work the crowd with microphone performances. Dynamite Rin represents the best qualities of proresu. Her fight with Great Luvia came to a draw as the Referee Shinji Matou was knocked out by the two fighters powerful drop kicks. Rin makes an appearance in Fate/Grand Order as a Craft Essence card. She appears as the illustration cover for Gandr\u00a0(\u30ac\u30f3\u30c9, Gando) and Formal Craft\u00a0(\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30de\u30eb\u30af\u30e9\u30d5\u30c8, F\u014dmaru Kurafuto).Abilities  Rin was born capable of manipulating all five great Elements, an extremely rare trait for a magi. Her potential is such that she will eventually be considered as one of the top one hundred ranking magi throughout the entire history of the Mage's Association. Compared using simple numbers, someone with an abnormally high potential like Ciel is at one hundred, someone who is eternally at apprentice-level like Shirou is at ten, and Rin falls from seventy to one hundred. As the successor to the Tohsaka family, Rin excels in Conversion of power, which includes storage of magical energy in objects, typically jewels for Jewel Magecraft. She uses them as disposable, limited-function Mystic Codes. Because the amount of energy a magus can release at one time is restricted by bodily limitations, Rin has been able to accumulate all of the magical energy generated by her body during her lifetime through jewel crystallization. As with practicing of sorcery, charging these jewels has become a daily process for her turning them into powerful bullets. However, in the end they are merely disposable items. Because their sorcery reduces expensive jewels to ash after a single use, the Tohsaka magi are fated to be chronically afflicted with a lack of funds. When Rin's stored power is needed, she can utilize the jewels for an instantaneous release of A-rank magic capable of countering a spell from Caster's magecraft from the Age of Gods or taking one of Berserker's lives by using five jewels. Their speed of release is great enough that it can match Caster's High-Speed Divine Words. She can also use small statues of amethyst in form of Owls\u00a0(\u689f, Fukur\u014d) as familiars for reconnaissance purposes. Her most common offensive spell is a Finnish technique known as Gandr, which concentrates magical energy into Rin's forefinger, resulting in a hazy black orb to be subsequently fired like a bullet. Originally intended to be a curse, Rin's variation on Gandr takes on an unusual, corporeal form. Additionally, Rin has bypassed any need for a verbal component to initiate this spell due to having inherited and infused Magic Crest of her family, and she can fire as many Gandr shots in an instant, even set up a barrier and rain them on an opponent if she so chooses. Since Rin's Gandr Shot was particularly violent, capable of punching through and disintegrating a large portion of a concrete wall with just a single shot, it could be considered on the level of Finn Shot. Or, Finn Gatling Gun. While statistically superior to Kirei Kotomine, he would win eighty percent of the time by psychologically exploiting her past traumas to keep her from fighting at her full potential. Even without such knowledge, Kirei would still have a substantial combat advantage over Rin due to possessing over ten years of experience as a professional killer of magi. If Bazett Fraga McRemitz had been able to participate in the war, she would ended up being a threat to Rin. Rin is also proficient with reinforcement sorcery, allowing her to strengthen her legs so much that she can run over one hundred meters in less than seven seconds, fast enough to be perceived as a blur to a regular human. She is also able to use it on herself for a few seconds to deal critical damage to even a Servant like Caster with physical blows in a situation where Rin has her off-guard. She can also make use of one of her jewels for a large amount of protection, and by placing it on her stomach to form a protective cover, she can even last a long duration of time being crushed in Berserker's grip. She can also use a degree of healing magic and ruins. Rin practices pseudo-karate as a form of self-defense. Her instructor in martial arts is Kirei, his teaching was responsible for the sequence of moves she used to corner Caster.Equipment  Rin has inherited everything that belonged to her father, including heirloom jewels, jewels inherited from Zelretch, and the wares and knowledge to manage her workshop, the basement of the Tohsaka household. She originally would have had possession of all the commercialized spiritual lands that brought in more money than most Second Owner families elsewhere, but Kirei's mismanagement as her legal guardian has caused the most valuable properties to have been lost to others. She still obtains royalties from magical patents held by the Tohsaka family, \"*0,000,000 yen\" annually without including additional revenue, so she can be considered relatively wealthy. She obtains jewels for her craft through exclusive channels used by her family, leaving her each day wondering \"whether she could've gotten a better price from the buyer if she had just become friends with that lady.\" In preparation for the Fifth Holy Grail War, Tokiomi left her a special inheritance in his will that requires her to solve a special puzzle to find and open a box of his effects. The most prominent items are a pendant and the catalyst, having been smashed at some point in time, he had used to summon Gilgamesh. Opening it also causes all the clocks in the household to immediately become set one hour fast as a bit of playfulness as if to say, \u201cif she can\u2019t even notice a slip-up as trivial and close to home as this, it\u2019s too soon for her to fight in the Holy Grail War.\u201dJewels  Rin buys a variety of jewels, and those she utilizes in combat can reach prices of 500,000 yen each. Those that are made of crystals that are naturally able to easily store mana are made of precious metals and come with a very high price. As of the beginning of Fate/stay night, her savings consists of twenty jewels containing the energy she has saved for over ten years, each costing ten million yen to create in total. She uses ten during Archer's summoning ritual, and uses the remaining ten during the battles of the three routes.Rin's Pendant  Rin's Pendant\u00a0(\u51db\u306e\u30da\u30f3\u30c0\u30f3\u30c8, Rin no Pendanto) is a powerful, one-of-a-kind jewel pendant left to Rin as part of her inheritance from her father, which she considers to be her father's memento. It is a one hundred year old Tohsaka family heirloom that is the greatest jewel within the household, far stronger than anything else with the equivalent of ten years worth of Rin's magical energy. As one of the best artifacts of its class that she believes Tokiomi left to allow her to win the Holy Grail War, Rin decides to utilize it as a last resort, believing anything to be possible with the amount of energy it possesses. It contains enough magical energy to revive a human being on the verge of death, which she uses early in the war to revive Shirou Emiya by restoring his damaged heart. She lacks the skill or ability to perform such a feat on her own, so it requires using the great energy of the pendant to make up for that. She creates a new heart to use as a substitute, believing the feat exemplary enough to be accepted to the Clock Tower instantly. After it is drained, it loses much of its weight and only retains a small amount of energy, less than her ten remaining jewels for battle. She leaves it by Shirou by accident, deciding not to retrieve it because it has no true worth without any remaining energy. It is simply an ordinary, expensive jewel like that, even though it has some value to her as a memento. Shirou picks it up after regaining consciousness, keeping it as a memento of his unknown savior. Archer, a future version of Shirou from another timeline, kept the jewel all his life, making it a catalyst that connects him to his summoner. The jewel she holds during the ritual has no worth as a catalyst, but the jewel held by Archer allows for him to be summoned. It is one of the objects materialized with him, allowing him to give her his own pendant after they arrive home with Rin not knowing the difference. The pendant held by Shirou has a small amount of energy left, not even enough to use a single Reinforcement spell according to him, while the one held by Archer has none. The connection is never discovered during Fate. Both pendants are revealed during Unlimited Blade Works after Shirou finds Archer's pendant at Rin's house and tells her of the one he kept, allowing for the connection between Shirou and Archer to be deduced due to that there should only be one such pendant in existence. Shirou eventually connects it to Rin during Heaven's Feel when thinking that she is the only person who could have saved him at that time. He brings it with him to the final battle with Sakura, later saving him by allowing Rider to use it as a landmark to locate him.Development  She had the most screen time out of every character in Fate/stay night.Creation and Conception  Kinoko Nasu's original story of Fate, Rin's original archetype was Misaya Reiroukan, she was designed to be a villainess and original master of Lancer in the novel. When Takashi Takeuchi convinced Nasu to change the setting of the story, Rin's role as a villain was eventually changed to one of the selectable heroines of Fate/stay night. Both Takashi Takeuchi and Kinoko Nasu thought Kana Ueda's voice is too cute and they thought \"Should we look for another possibility for Rin's voice? How about making Rin act overly proud with a cute voice? However it could be risky.\" In the end they dared to make Rin's voice cute. Kana Ueda figured out how to play Rin in the Studio Deen anime adaptation when she played the original Fate/stay night game, she understood Rin had to put away her feelings a long time ago. When Kana was recording the radio show for Fate /stay night, Takeuchi made illustrations of Rin on colored paper for her. Even though Kana had been selected for the part, when it came to voicing the character for the real thing, she could not imagine Rin coming out of her voice. For a long time she had this sense of incompatibility. She normally don't feel that sense of incompatibility when she play characters from other works. Kana was half in doubt so she ended up asking Nasu if it was really okay for her to play Rin. He said it was fine, but she wondered if it was all right. Kana also thought maybe she should not say that in front of the scenario writer. While playing Rin in Fate/stay night, several other spinoff and related products. She tries to make her match the pace of the story she is in. There are a lot of very delicate, minor changes. In the Studio Deen adaptation TV series, Rin decided to watch over Shirou and Saber. When they recorded the voices for the PS2 game Realta Nua, Rin was a lot more emotional than she was in the show. Kana has to adjust her acting carefully within that kind of field.Reception  Gen Urobuchi thinks the true heroine of Fate/stay night is Rin because in the Unlimited Blade Works route, it was an equal relationship with a woman who's become stronger than most men is depicted. Rin and Shirou mend each other's weaknesses with their own unique strengths, and he think it makes it a very nice relationship. In response to what Gen said Nasu stated that \"It's true that Rin is different from Saber. Rin is written as a completely different gender. She also has a sort of pride in the fact that she's a beautiful girl. With a girl like that by his side, even an unsociable person like Shirou loses his presence of mind.\" Takeuchi commented how impressed he was with how Rin turned out. Stating that the idea of making a villainous character that everybody had a low opinion of into a major heroine was initially largely frowned upon by the staff and it was a huge risk. However, after successfully finishing the game, the character became a success, and was greatly well liked. Kana Ueda (Voice Actress of Rin) thought of her as a commanding and imperious young girl, like her name implies. Although hidden within that image of a girl who always tries hard is someone who is also childish and playful. Rin has both of these aspects, and she's charming because of it. Kana Ueda has played the role of Rin for such a long time that she really like the Master and Servant pairing of Rin and Archer now. Kana compared herself to Rin, she think she's a little more excitable than Rin, and she make more mistakes. Kana tries not to let it show, but she doesn't mind if you see them because she's a clumsy girl. Personally speaking, she wanted to continue with another story set in the Fate main timeline. She thinks it'd be great if she gets to play Rin again.References Illyasviel von Einzbern  Illyasviel von Einzbern\u00a0(\u30a4\u30ea\u30e4\u30b9\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3\u30fb\u30a2\u30a4\u30f3\u30c4\u30d9\u30eb\u30f3, Iriyasuf\u012bru fon Aintsuberun), often referred to as Illya, is the Master of Berserker in the Fifth Holy Grail War of Fate/stay night. She is the daughter of Kiritsugu Emiya and Irisviel von Einzbern, both whom participated in the Fourth Holy Grail War, and the adoptive older sister of Shirou Emiya.Profile Background  The Einzbern, one of three families of sorcerers involved in the Holy Grail War (the others being the Tohsaka and the Makiri/Matou), were responsible for creation of the vessel which the souls of the defeated Servants would go into, while the Makiri created the system of Masters and Servants and the Tohsaka supplied the land which became Fuyuki City. As such, Illya was prepared by her family to act as a living vessel for the Grail.Early Years  Illyasviel is a homunculus, an artificial human given life by applying sorcery to sperm cells, originally created and raised by the Einzbern family. During the Heaven's Feel scenario, it is insinuated that the sperm used to create her was donated by Kiritsugu Emiya, a fact that is confirmed in Fate/hollow ataraxia and Fate/Zero. She is the biological daughter of Kiritsugu Emiya and Irisviel von Einzbern, Irisviel was gifted a working womb so she gave natural birth to Illya. In the Fate/Zero Drama CD, she was born out of love between Kiritsugu and Irisviel. She will be Kiritsugu's reason for living when he comes back from the war. She is actually slightly older than Shirou, her childlike appearance being a result of a distorted growth rate. Because the head of the family Jubstacheit von Einzbern anticipated the possibility that Kiritsugu and Irisviel would fail to win the Fourth Holy Grail War, he allowed Illyasviel to be born with modifications to allow her to become the Holy Grail should a Fifth Holy Grail War occur.Before the Fifth Grail War  With her father abandoning her after the Fourth Holy Grail War, she became angry with Kiritsugu, and consequently, Shirou. Angra Mainyu appeared to her in form of her mother and was turning Illyasviel against her father & adoptive brother. The Einzberns then trained Illya harshly in order to groom her as the next vessel for the Grail and as a Master who would finally bring the Grail to the Einzbern family. Two months before the Fifth Grail war, Jubstacheit von Einzbern threw Illya into the wilderness. Illya was able to summon the Heracles with a slab of rock from a temple as a catalyst. The Einzbern cheated by gathering materials from the Greater Grail which allowed Illya to successfully summon a Servant a full 2 months in advance. Even old man Acht was surprised by this result. Berserker protected Illya from a pack of wolves and the two bonded together.Appearance  Much like the other Einzbern homunculi, Illyasviel has crimson eyes and long white hair. Similar to her mother, Irisviel, Illya also bears a genetic resemblance to her ancestor, Justeaze Lizrich von Einzbern, who was responsible for the formation of the core of the Holy Grail. She wears a collared, purple long-sleeved shirt with a light purple scarf to match, a long white skirt and purple boots. Though Illya was born through natural means, her body has been heavily modified before and after her birth to maximize the magical circuits in her body, making her the ultimate homunculus and a refined vessel for the Holy Grail. As a result of the modifications to her body, her physical body develops slowly and her father, Kiritsugu Emiya, correctly assesses that her physical body will not develop secondary sexual characteristics. By the time she is eight years old, Kiritsugu notes that his Walther rifle is heavier than Illya is. A decade later, when Illya meets Shirou Emiya, she still looks as though she's a young girl rather than a young woman.Personality  Illya is cheerful and outgoing, upbeat and generally exhibits a positive attitude. Possessing a friendly demeanor, she is easy to talk to and tends to be playful and mischievous. Deep inside, however, Illya is lonely as she has no friends her own age to play with and is often stuck inside the Einzbern castle honing her magecraft. She asks those she feels comfortable around to call her \"Illya\". Illya's personal interest in Shirou is conflicted due to the fact that Kiritsugu, whom she loved for he was her father, remained in Japan as Shirou's adoptive father after betraying her family by destroying the long-sought Grail. She feels that Kiritsugu abandoned her for Shirou, and is jealous of Shirou for that. When she first meets Shirou, she considers him as something of an older brother. Though he is distrustful of her at first, he comes to like Illya, seeing her as a little sister. However at the same time, she also feels very close to Shirou for his relationship with Kiritsugu. As such, she becomes very affectionate and clingy towards him (like a younger sibling would) when Berserker is defeated, much to Saber and Rin's annoyance. It can be said that Illya gets her outward personality from her mother. Like her mother, she is kind and has the qualities of a child. However, she also has a measure of her father in her, as she can be callous and kill others without remorse. She is also unstable.\u00a0Role Fate/Zero  She has a minor role in Fate/Zero, she first appeared in the beginning when she was born. As she grows up, she was very fond of her father which surprises Saber as Saber thought Kiritsugu was a cold person. Kiritsugu while carrying her realizes that she stopped growing. Before he leaves for the war, Kiritsugu promises to return to Illya, who promises to wait until he returns. Illya does not remain far from Kiritsugu and Irisviel's thoughts during the war. During a brief moment of respite, Kiritsugu expresses his despair to his wife and his desire to take their daughter and flee. However, Irisviel assures him that he must continue. During the final days of the war, Irisviel's consciousness is consumed by the Grail, Irisviel requests Kiritsugu bring Illya to Japan and to make their daughter happy. However, as Irisviel becomes the Grail, she witnesses a vision of Illya fearing her own fate of becoming the Grail one day. Kiritsugu's own vision in the Grail eventually shows him destroying everyone he wants to protect, including all his loved ones, until he is finally forced to murder Illya. Though Kiritsugu survives the Fourth Grail War, his choice to destroy the Grail rather than realize the Third Magic is perceived as a betrayal by the Einzbern. He makes multiple attempts to retrieve Illya, but he is prevented from succeeding by Jubstacheit refusing to open the bounded barrier around the Einzbern castle. With his deteriorating body, he could not find the entrance of the bounded field and he died regretting the thought of not being able to save her. Illya never knew that her father had repeatedly tried to save her and she was groomed to despise Kiritsugu for his betrayal.Fate/stay night  Illya travels to Japan to participate in the Fifth Holy Grail War as the master of Berserker. During the initial stages of the war, she lives in the Einzbern Castle on the outskirts of Fuyuki City, accompanied only by her Servant and two maids Leysritt and Sella. The reason Saber never mentioned Illya in the Fifth Holy Grail War was that she had never asked Irisviel about her daughter\u2019s name, and Illya\u2019s appearance seemed physically too young for her to be Irisviel\u2019s daughter. So, she viewed Illya as an Einzbern homunculus completely unrelated to Irisviel.Fate  In the Fate route, Illya initially appears as an enemy to Shirou Emiya. Unbeknownst to Shirou, his adopted father had been the Master for the previous War, representing the Einzbern family. Kiritsugu's decision to destroy the Holy Grail had been regarded as a betrayal and is the apparent reason for why Illya has decided to specifically target Shirou. After Saber is weakened after her fight against Rider, Shirou is captured by Illya, who gives him the proposition to become her servant, which he refuses. Frustrated with his response, she orders Berserker to attack Rin, Saber and Archer, who had come to save Shirou. Archer sacrifices himself in order to allow Rin, Saber, and Shirou to escape, by staying behind to fight Berserker despite knowing he is outmatched. He manages to take six of Berserker's twelve lives (five in the anime) before he is ultimately defeated. In order to replenish Saber's mana, Shirou gives a part of his magical circuit to her in R\u00e9alta Nua and they go fight against Illya and Berserker. Berserker is defeated by Saber and Shirou after the latter traces Caliburn, Saber's original sword. Without the protection of her Servant, Illya joins Shirou's household. Illya attacks Gilgamesh after he kills Caster due to her confusion of the existence of a eighth Servant. However, he merely reflects at her, but she defended by Rin and soon collapses after taking in Caster's soul. She is later kidnapped by Kirei Kotomine when he invades the Emiya Residence to use her to summon the Holy Grail. After Kirei's death, She is freed from the Grail before it is destroyed by Shirou and Saber. Two months later, Illya becomes good friends with Sakura, and lives at Fujimura residence. She lives peacefully with Shirou and winds up being by Taiga. Notably, she is somewhat attached to Shirou, and believing Taiga to be an annoyance, she is often at odds with her. However, according to Zouken Matou, she has less than a year to live due to being an Einzbern homunculi. Though a Tiger Dojo hints that Illya ended up living a full, natural lifespan somehow.Unlimited Blade Works  In the Unlimited Blade Works route, she has a lesser role. She introduces herself as a Master to Shirou and Rin, but since the most dangerous servant in the route is Caster, she doesn't attack them. In order to defeat Caster, Shirou and Rin decide to form an alliance with Illya. However, they arrive too late at her castle and Illya is defeated and killed by Gilgamesh after the latter rips her heart out of her body. Before dying, her past together with Berserker is fully expanded, revealing that after Kiritsugu left her, Illya went through a cruel training by the Einzberns so she could be able to control Berserker and be their representative in the Grail War.Heaven's Feel  During Heaven's Feel, Illya does the same thing that she did in Fate: upon realizing that Kiritsugu is dead, she decides to take revenge on Shirou. She attacks Rin and Shirou by surprise and Shirou gets injured after protecting Saber. When they meet again in the park, she forms a friendly relationship with Shirou and they chat frequently in the park. She tells him about her past and about the Dress of Heaven. She also appears to be aware of the relationship between Shirou and Archer. Illya is later attacked by Zouken Matou after Berserker is defeated by Saber Alter and corrupted into becoming one of Sakura Matou's Servants. Once Berserker is destroyed, Illya reveals the truth regarding Heaven's Feel, the Holy Grail, and Angra Mainyu, the corruption in the Grail. Together with Rin, they work together to replicate the Jeweled Sword of Zelretch, which Rin intends to wield against Sakura, who has become a second vessel for the corrupted contents of the Grail. Illya remains behind while Shirou and Rin confront Sakura, extracting a promise that they will return alive. During Shirou's battle with Saber Alter, Illya locates the Dress of Heaven, a Mystic Code passed down by the Einzberns. Realizing that even if Shirou manages to defeat and retrieve Sakura it would be insufficient to save everyone from the Grail's destructive power, Illya intends to utilize the Dress of Heaven to protect Shirou. If the affection score for her is high enough, it results in Sakura's True Ending (if the affection score is low, she regretfully kills Shirou resulting in a Bad End). Illya wearing the Dress of Heaven appears in front of Zouken Matou and asks him why he must keep himself alive. Meanwhile, Shirou cancelled the connection between Sakura and Angra Mainyu, so she starts retrieving the defeated Servants' soul. And she stops Shirou who is about to sacrifice himself to destroy the Greater Grail. Illya reveals to Shirou that she is his older sister and tells him that her duty is to protect him because of it. By the use of the Dress of Heaven, she materializes his soul incompletely and gives him a portion of her body as his soul's temporary container. Now then she closes Gates of Heaven as a Grail.Manga  In the manga version of Fate/stay night (which follows the Fate and Unlimited Blade Works scenarios), the events involving her character follow the Fate route. After kidnapping Shirou, losing Berserker and ultimately being defeated by Shirou and Saber, she ends up living happily at Shirou's house.Fate/hollow ataraxia  Illya plays a small role throughout the four day loop. She tends to show up wherever she pleases, but usually seeks out Shirou to do things. On the third day of one of the loops, Shirou attempts to visit the Einzbern Manor in the woods, but is stopped by Illya and Berserker. In a future loop after that encounter, she sets up a \"castle siege\" utilizing her Servant and Homunculi maids to make reaching her castle a \"grand experience\". After conquering the \"siege\", Shirou is able to visit the manor without issue in subsequent loops. Illya talks to Shirou about her history with Kiritsugu and Irisviel before the Fourth Grail War. During the assault of the dog-shadows, Illya and Berserker are also involved in the fight to exterminate them, much like the other Servants.Carnival Phantasm  Illya has a number of small roles in Carnival Phantasm, often as a commentator in the parody versions of the Holy Grail War with Kirei Kotomine. She is usually seen alongside Berserker.Today's Menu for Emiya Family  Illya makes an appearance in Episode 3, which is centered around Hinamatsuri, or Girl's Day. A confused Illya is dressed in a kimono and taken to Shirou's house where Shirou and his friends are prepared to celebrate the day with her. The whole party was devised by Taiga. Illya appears again near the end of Episode 6, visiting Shirou and surprised to find he is cooking hamburgers. The Episode had centered around the first time Shirou had cooked hamburgers for their father, Kiritsugu.Capsule Servant Other appearances  In the \"Apocrypha\" universe, Illyasviel wasn't born as the Fuyuki Holy Grail War ended in the third. Therefore, Kiritsugu won\u2019t end up becoming involved with the Einzberns. She happens to appear as Pseudo-servant Sitonai in the Gotterdammerung Lostbelt of Fate Grand OrderAbilities  Illya has unsurpassed potential as a Master amongst all Masters past and present. 70% of her body is composed of Magic Circuits. They are also her Command Spell and show themselves as a red pattern all over her body when she generates magical energy. The power of her Command Spell is strong enough to control Berserker who can disobey normal Command Spells. Her Command Spell is carved all over her body, and the number of her Magic Circuits overwhelms that of a typical magus. These factors and many more make her almost a vessel that exists to win the Holy Grail War. Illya has an unlimited supply of mana, thus allowing her to control Berserker without too much difficulty. Still, she suppresses the rank of Mad Enhancements to make it easy to control him when out of combat. As a Mage, she is a top mage in Fuyuki, if it's at the land that houses the Greater Grail. Still, first-class mages would follow the \"since she's a child of nature, just cut her off from the land first\" plan, so it's not like she's invincible. Kayneth El-Melloi Archibald  and Tokiomi Tohsaka may be able to best her in a magic duel. Similar to the wire construct wielded by her mother, she is able to make a familiar from her hair. The name of the technique is Engel Note: Angel's Poem\u00a0(, ). The bird's name is Storch Ritter: Knight of Stork\u00a0(, ). The Ibis that shoots bullets is Zelle\u00a0(\u30c4\u30a8\u2014\u30ec, Tsuere, German for \"cell\"), and she can also transform them into a Degen\u00a0(\u30c7\u30fc\u30b2\u30f3, D\u0113gen, German for \"\u00e9p\u00e9e\"). They are autonomous beings that defend her and pursue targets automatically, strong enough to defend against Rin's Gandr shots, fast enough to dodge them, and shown to be able to fire small blasts of magical energy capable of easily shooting through them. They each generate a considerable amount of magical energy, and Rin compares each to a \"miniature magus.\" She can easily create up to four without any issue, and she can change their shape into swords. Illya posesses Mystic Eyes of Binding which she used to capture Shirou. Though she says her Mystic eyes aren't that powerful.Vessel of the Grail  In Fate/Zero, the process of the Grail's creation was detailed. As each servant dies, its energy would flow into her artificial body. When six servants die, her body would be destroyed and give birth to the Holy Grail. Thus, by having Homunculus participate in the war, the Einzbern master would never be able to make a wish even when they win. The Einzbern family is fixated on victory alone because they are the family that came up with the Holy Grail War, but never won a single war. As a vessel of the Grail, Illya's body can only take up to 4 servants and if she absorbs the fifth servant, she wouldn't function as a human any longer. Being the vessel of the Grail, Illya is able to wear the Dress of Heaven. The garment allows for the materialization of the soul and is the pinnacle of the Third Magic the Einzbern family seeks to recover through the Holy Grail Wars. She dons the Dress of Heaven during the Heaven's Feel scenario, albeit in an incomplete form of the Third Magic, to assist Shirou in completing their father's mission to stop Angra Mainyu and obliterate the Holy Grail.Development Creation and Conception  Originally Illya was planned to be one of the heroines, however if that were made then the release date of Fate/Stay Night would be delayed by another half a year. Her route would have been part of Sakura story. Rather than only choosing to become Sakura's hero or fulfill his ideals as an Ally of Justice on the ninth day of Heaven's Feel, Shirou would have also had an option to become Illya's hero instead. However, due to the length, they thought to release Saber and Rin as Fate/stay night and Sakura and Illya in a separate release titled \"Fate/other night\", but they thought it would have been too expensive. Illya's route was instead combined with Heaven's Feel because they decided to include Sakura's route in Fate/stay night. Nasu Kinoko jokingly commented that the Illya route is the \"Prisma\u2606Illya\" because Hiroshi Hiroyama was able to finish what he couldn't do.Reception References Rider (Fate/stay night)  Rider\u00a0(\u30e9\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc, Raid\u0101) is the Rider-class Servant of Sakura Matou in the Fifth Holy Grail War of Fate/stay night. Due to Sakura's unwillingness to participate as a Master, Shinji Matou is instead given control over Rider. She only truly acts as Sakura's Servant when their connection is revealed in the Heaven's Feel scenario. She is one of the Servants of the Protagonist of the Grand Order conflicts of Fate/Grand Order.Profile Identity  Rider's True Name is Medusa, the Gorgon from Greek mythology. Rather than being a regular Heroic Spirit, she is an existence closer to a Divine Spirit, but her actions have made it better to categorize her as an \"anti-hero closer to a monster.\" With her older sisters Stheno and Euryale, they made up the three Gorgon Sisters who inhabited the Shapeless Isle. She was known as the \"woman who dominates\", an anti-hero who became as such due to the dark thoughts of humans. Differing from someone like Hassan-i-Sabbah who was a hero who actually existed, she is said to be one of legends born by the gathering of belief. The legend of Medusa is different than her actual life. She was said to be a half-human, half-god female beast often portrayed with the form of a snake. Originally she was an Earth Goddess\u00a0(\u5927\u5730\u306e\u5973\u795e, Daichi no Megami). While all originally beautiful women, she and her sisters were hated by Poseidon's wife because of his love for them. Athena, jealous of their beautiful hair, transformed them into demons. Secluding themselves in a lightless temple on the Shapeless Isle, they only attacked humans with a reason. Eventually, as a victim of the gods' unreasonable actions, she was to have her head cut off on their whim. Defeated by Perseus by reflecting her petrification back at her with his mirror-like shield, Pegasus, the son of Poseidon, was said to have sprung from the blood of her headless neck.Life  Medusa and her sisters were born from the wishes of mankind for ideal idols, the embodiment of the yearning hearts of men. As \"perfect goddesses\", their \"divine essence\" was to remain the same from the moment of their creation to their destruction. Medusa was an exception who was a failure from birth, growing older over time. Though they should have all been copies, or even as close as clones, resulting from the deification of the same phenomenon, a mistake in her birth or something of deeper significance caused her to be copied imperfectly. While she did not embody \"forever young and immortal\", she gained abilities in compensation compared to her sisters' inability to even care for themselves. With divine powers, her Mystic Eyes, indispensable in protecting her sisters who could not live in the world on their own, this caused the previously united sisters to become three separate individuals. Although Medusa was different from the start, even the other two showed irregularities, their sadistic nature, from interacting with her. She was originally considered to be a princess loved by humans, but Athena, jealous of their beauty, cursed Medusa alone, taking away her \"faith from each and every person\" and exiling her to the Shapeless Isle. Their love for her turned to hatred, and she was banished by those who had adored her. The island had nothing to offer compared to her days of luxury, and she prayed that none of the humans that now frightened her with their unwarranted resentment would tread on the island. Weeping in loneliness, she had no idea as to her sin that forced her to be exiled. Although her sisters were not affected and still greatly loved, they too accompanied her there out of caring for their younger sister. She was happy even on the barren island due to their company, and only had to fear the coming humans. While they became rumored as monsters, her sisters were still revered by nearby men, while she was feared as a monster. Humans sought to kill that which had been branded as a monster and take away the goddesses, and after they began to also target her sisters, she decided to protect them while taking her revenge on the humans. Although littered with statues that had been warriors, they were harmonious for a time on the island, at one point receiving her Pegasus from Poseidon. Though bullied by her sisters daily, she simply moved about the island on days humans did not appear, hoping for the peace to continue. Repaying them in the same manner as they treated her, she killed many humans, simply hoping to be left alone on the only place she could exist with the company of her sisters. Though she was protecting them from the foolish humans who sought their own deaths, her sisters warned her not to take pleasure in killing them. Using her eyes that were only a deterrent to sow terror in humans, she began to experiment in ways of killing them more quickly. Deciding to become a trap against those who would take her sisters, even they who had always been full of joy began to fear her after she started drinking their blood instead of simply petrifying them. The humans continued to journey the island no matter the infamy surrounding her, and she eventually became too ashamed of her slowly disfiguring self to appear before her sisters. Leaving them, she once again found herself alone, hungering for new sacrifices to replace her sadness and loneliness. She grew into the Gorgon each day as her body, heart, and very being decayed, all backed by the thought of becoming stronger for the sake of protecting her sisters. Even that reached a point where her sisters instead became nuisances who were intruding upon her lair. They appeared before her after her full descent into a monster, lamenting that they had not asked for her protection and were just letting her enjoy what had seemed fun to her. Saddened by her state, they sacrificed themselves to the Gorgon because the sister who protected them was no longer there. Consumed by countless snakes without any trace of joy or sadness, they were ground into pulp and absorbed into the beast while still alive. Without leaving a trace, they became its flesh and blood, and it continued to thrive as the Gorgon sisters became monsters of nightmares and legends. The Gorgon's notoriety continued until Perseus decided to bring back its head for his own fame. Granted five Noble Phantasms, he boldly traveled to the Shapeless Isle without any hesitation, only realizing his folly upon seeing the state of the island. He despaired upon encountering it, having decided that there is no victory to be found against the demon god, with his Noble Phantasms only acting as lifesaving equipment in the best scenario. Avoiding her gaze by focusing on his Mirror shield, he desperately fought to survive. Tired of toying with him, it used Breaker Gorgon, and he used the only possible method of defeating it, using Kibisis to have it encage itself. Reversing the nightmare of the Bounded Field upon it, it suffered as Medusa as the nightmare reflected upon it instead of Perseus. While it was a \"nightmare beyond nightmares\", it was not an evil vision that caused excruciating pain, but a pleasant dream of her sisters, paralyzing her with the joy of seeing those she thought she would never again meet. Despairing upon the reflection of itself from when it was still self-aware, this allowed Perseus to have his single counterattack, severing its head with Harpe. The monster, out of its own will, became Medusa again and let itself be struck down. Perseus used Kibisis to hold its head, later going on to become a successful hero.Appearance  The Medusa materialized in the Fifth Holy Grail War appears differently to her legend. She appears to be in her human form, unlike her legend where she has snake for her hairs, she has long purple hair. She wears an eye cover that seals her excessively powerful Mystic Eyes of Petrification within the Bounded Field. Her sight is completely sealed. Although Rider perceives the world through senses such as hearing, touch, smell, and magic-detection, she is able to acquire more precise information than sight. She has a complex about her own height and the way she gets embarrassed when people see her Mystic Eyes, she might actually be pretty ladylike. Because of her outward appearance and primary weapon, a lot of people thought she was going to be an Assassin class Servant. In her casual attire, she wears a black polo neck top and blue jeans. She wears Touko Aozaki's \"Mystic Eye Killer\" to disable her Mystic Eyes. It only seals the power of petrification. It does not act like the Breaker Gorgon, which \"seals all magical properties\".Personality  Rider is silent, sultry, and vigilant, never hesitating to shield her Master from harm. She is always faithful to her Master, even with Shinji acting in that role most of the time. She is not openly talkative, and she prefers to analyze people and their actions. She is very protective of Sakura and willing to sacrifice herself for Sakura's happiness. She is very logical and she doesn't act out of anger or instinct.Role Fate/stay night  Rider's initial Master was Sakura Matou; however, she became the Servant of Shinji when Sakura, pressured by Shinji, yielded her Master's right to him. Rider holds no love for Shinji, seeing him as vile and predatory, but obeys his commands as a dutiful Servant. Because of their similar backgrounds, she is empathetic of Sakura, and seeks to protect her whenever possible. Like many of the Servants who participated in the 5th Holy Grail War, Rider has no motivation for seeking the Holy Grail. Although regarded as one of the more powerful Servants of the 5th Holy Grail War, Rider is eliminated in almost every scenario. She is obliterated by Saber's Excalibur in Fate, and killed early on in Unlimited Blade Works by Caster's master, Souichirou Kuzuki.Heaven's Feel  However, during Heaven's Feel, Rider is liberated from her indenture to Shinji, and assists Shirou Emiya in his battle against Saber Alter and Angra Mainyu.Fate/hollow ataraxia  During Fate/hollow ataraxia, Rider is often found in the Emiya Houshold, always engaging in her passion for reading. She has a tentative relationship with Shirou(actually Avenger in disguise) in which they spend time reading together in her room. She has a part-time job in the marketplace, and tends to go out on her own for entertainment, revealing her fondness of the pool in Shinto. Despite having become more open with people, it is obvious that her actions are mostly done with Sakura in mind, going as far as to stop doing things she likes to appease her Master. When Avenger realizes the truth and decides to end the ongoing temporal loop, Rider aids the other Servants in holding back the invasion of Shadow Wolf Beasts during the Fuyuki eclipse. In part due to her aid, Avenger reaches the Grail and sends himself into oblivion. In her Eclipse scenario The backside of Kibisis Rider together with Sakura appear both naked in front of Shirou and seduce him with their gorgeous big breasted bodies into threesome. However eventually it turns out that whole scenery is just Rider's illusion cast by her Breaker Gorgon as she was trying to get Shirou to pursue Sakura more aggressively. Yet in the middle Shirou realizes the truth and reverses her spell on her, in the end revealing that Rider herself has deep feelings for Shirou. Apparently embarrassed by the whole situation, Rider erased the whole dream from Shirou's mind and upon finally waking up Shirou has no recollection of the event, although Rider obviously does. She contemplates acting on the feelings she came to terms with in the dream, but stands aside for Sakura's sake once more.Fate/Unlimited Codes  In Fate/Unlimited Codes, she is known as the Bewitching Black Serpent\u00a0(\u5996\u8276\u306a\u308b\u9ed2\u304d\u86c7, Y\u014den'naru Kuroki Hebi). Her arcade story follow closely to the Heaven's Feel route. As Sakura removed her Command Spells, the connection between the two has been disconnected and Rider is free. Sakura requested Rider to protect Shirou and to form a contract with him. Rider decided to fulfill her final request before Sakura consumed by the Grail. As she is still strong with the mana Sakura provided, she was prepared to fade from this world. However Rider decided to fulfill her duty as Sakura's Servant. Rider encounters Caster in her mid-fight in Ryuudou Temple. Caster greets her intruder and asks her reason to fight as she considers Rider, a stray Servant who has been thrown out by her Master like yesterday's trash. Rider states she wants the Holy Grail and questions Caster if there is any difference in whether a human or a Servant wants to get their hands on the Holy Grail. Caster replies that as long as the wish is sincere and she can tell that Rider is willing to do whatever it takes to get a hold of it. But Caster considers this is not enough reason to fight, therefore, there must have other reason why Rider desires the Grail. Caster reasoned that Rider might be devoted to the ritual itself. Rider decided to defeat Caster, as she would be able to use both white or black Grail too well and they never did get along. In her final fight, Rider meets the corrupted Dark Sakura and has defeated all the other Servants. Sakura would thank her but her body has not absorb the souls of the defeated Servants and she see Rider's eyes as if they are housing a great deal of power. Rider confirms that she has stored the souls of the Servants in order to use the most powerful versions of Breaker Gorgon and Blood Fort Andromeda. Sakura asked Rider to hurry up and present them to her so she can finish the ritual, she wanted to hold on to Rider's head. Rider doesn't deny that she has already exceeded her limits. Her body will not last much longer than a few more minutes. She believe it to be acceptable compensation to cancel the ritual before Sakura completely turn into the Grail. Sakura ask Rider to stop speaking, she will even forgive Rider if she stops and even heal her body. Sakura was madden when Rider wants to stop her and questions why everybody turned their back on her. After Sakura was defeated, the Holy Grail becomes complete when the souls of the Servants are offered to it. So if all of the souls are used for something else, and not offered to the Grail. The ritual will end without the Holy Grail Vessel being damaged. It was not the most elegant of strategies, but it was the only way Rider could do it which she got the idea from Caster. As Sakura wakes up. Rider greets her with a Good morning. Rider comforted Sakura saying she won't be having any more nightmares from now on as the Holy Grail, or the Matou will ever threaten her again. Rider's body starts to disappear, as the Holy Grail War is over. Rider says everything will return to normal and she wants Sakura to live her life. Sakura apologizes and begs Rider not to leave. Rider is the one who is sorry, she bids her farewell and was so glad that she was able to save Sakura.Fate/tiger colosseum series  Rider's route in the game depicts her excited to start off her day with the hopes of trying on new pair of suspiciously tiger stripped glasses that promises to increase the wearer's power. However, she quickly finds the glasses have been stolen and the window in the living room busted open. Quickly concluding that it was a thief, Rider begins her rampage throughout the city, along the way recruiting a reluctant Archer, and failing to obtaining Caster's help. Ultimately, it was discovered that Rin was the culprit behind the theft of the glasses and while Rider soundly defeats her after gloating Rin into a fight, she discovers that Rin's own shenanigans ruined all of the magical properties of the glasses. As Rider sat in shame of her failure, it is revealed that the glasses weren't power enhances, but breast size minimizes, a fact Caster teases Rider on.Fate/Grand Order GUDAGUDA Honnouji  Medusa appears in the singularity under name Sanada Medusa, where she acts as translator for her lord, Takeda Darius due him speaking only in roars. When she and Takeda encounter Ritsuka, Mash, Okita, and Nobunaga, Medusa translates her lord's intentions to the group. After the group defeats them, she translates Takeda's last words, and she feels relieved that the entire ordeal is over before disappearing herself.Interlude  In her first interlude Gorgon Bride\u00a0(\u30b4\u30eb\u30b4\u30f3\u306e\u82b1\u5ac1, Gorugon no Hanayome), Medusa tells Ritsuka Fujimaru that her sisters have decided to arrange a marriage for her to tease her. However, she can only get out of the arranged marriage on the condition that she is already in a couple. So, she and Ritsuka pretend to be a couple while Romani records them for video evidence. However, their \"date\" is interrupted when a man tries to flirt with Medusa, but the man attacks with his friends when she rejects him. After defeating them, she thanks Ritsuka for treating her like a normal person.Fate/Extella  She makes her first appearance in the Fate/EX universe, but this time as a selectable playable character for Hakuno Kishinami.

She fights mainly with a Nameless Dagger\u00a0(\u7121\u9298\u00b7\u77ed\u5263, Mumei Tanken) in close combat that is more likely to be called a \"nail\" rather than a \"dagger.\" It is attached to a long chain that can restrain and immobilize targets that she pierces. It is not suited to short-range battles, instead best utilized as a thrown weapon from a distance. It is not a Noble Phantasm, and while its origin is unknown, it is thought to be a weapon that reflects her inner character. She boasts outstanding speed, moving like a bullet and racing around the battlefield. She is faster than Lancer in terms of average speed, but he will surpass her in immediate maximum output. Due to her nature as a Gorgon, she has a monster alignment that may make fighting battles against monster exterminators, such as against an expert like Lancer, tough for her. While she is normally blindfolded, she perceives the world through hearing, touch, smell, and magic-detection to have an even more precise outlook than with sight. She is a unique Heroic Spirit who displays a great variety of skills and Noble Phantasms that are particularly high numbered even amongst other Servants, all of which are traces left from her time as a goddess. Due to her status as a former earth goddess, she has a strong connection to the earth, sensitive enough to its state to be able to sense disturbances in Fuyuki's leyline. Due to her contract being passed to Shinji, her abilities are lowered, and she must seek out alternative means of magical energy. While she takes blood for the most part, she is not a Dead Apostle, but rather a bloodsucker whose most efficient manner of gaining energy is through drinking blood. Her main offensive Noble Phantasm is Bellerophon, which allows the Pegasus to use an extremely powerful charge that resembles an arrow of light. She also has use of Blood Fort Andromeda, a Bounded Field designed to collect life energy from whoever is inside. Once it is set and activated, it can instantly liquify any normal humans inside and convert them into energy. Breaker Gorgon is another Bounded Field that seals the target inside the user's mind. She mainly uses it on herself in the form of a visor to seal her Mystic Eyes.Cybele  Cybele\u00a0(\u30ad\u30e5\u30d9\u30ec\u30a4, Kyuberei), the Mystic Eyes of Petrification\u00a0(\u77f3\u5316\u306e\u9b54\u773c, Sekika no Magan), are Rider's Mystic Eyes, said to be a \"curse of the gods sealed by the powers of shrines.\" Though petrification sorcery is no strange thing for modern Thaumaturgy, even if its users are rare and few in numbers, Mystic Eyes capable of petrifying others are something that nobody, human or not, possesses in the present era. They are designated as Jewel under the Noble Colors system, which surpasses the Gold-ranked Eyes of the Dead Apostles and are exclusively possessed by Holy Spirits and Magical Beasts from the Age of Gods. Their nature is strong enough a mystery that Shirou mistakes the identity of Breaker Gorgon as the eyes themselves. The eyes, almost too abnormal to be called eyeballs, are gray with an appearance similar to crystals. Despite their abnormality, Shirou believes that they are too beautiful for any human to possess, and could either be art the gods admired or a nature they cursed. The corneas do not take in light, and the pupils see the world through a square. The irises are solidified, not allowing the eyes to close, and the millions of cells that make up the retinas are composed of the Sixth Imaginary Element. It affects all targets within the owner\u2019s field of vision, regardless of whether said targets are looking at the Eyes physically, or if they have their eyes closed but continue to view her with their mind's eye, as it is a curse to look upon her in any way. The only way Perseus was able to avoid her gaze was by utilizing his mirror shield to find her location without looking upon her at all. Those who possess Rank C or lower in Mana will be immediately petrified, while those with Rank B may or may not be affected depending of the conditions. Those with Rank A or higher won\u2019t be petrified, but will sustain \"pressure\" from the Eyes and receive a one rank-down to all parameters. The entire body of the target will be affected, including clothing and weaponry, \"killing them while alive\" as they are turned to stone. The ability is viable in petrifying a group of enemies, but it would not be useful against an infinite number like the horde of shades spawned by Avenger. The amount of energy it uses is comparable to also fighting them off with her Noble Phantasms, so it would quickly drain her faster than simply fighting them off in melee combat. When Archer, with Rank B Mana, is affected at close range, he instantly feels the effects. He is immediately is frozen in place, unable to close his eyes or cover them with his arms even if he wanted to do so due to being unable to move either in the slightest. He tries to charge at her afterward, but his legs are already petrified up to his knees at that point. He is petrified up to his waist only a moment later before the effect is canceled. Shirou and Rin feel the effects instantly when targeted further away, barely or unable to move as their blood starts thickening. It immediately starts solidifying the flow of Shirou's body and ceasing his senses. If he tries to run at her, his body is instantly turned to stone, and his mind swiftly follows. He is only saved when Sakura acting up causes Rider to cease her activity. She is unable to control them in any manner on her own, requiring the use of Mystic Eye Killers like Breaker Gorgon or the glasses and contacts she later replaces it with after the Holy Grail War ends. Knowledge of the eyes render further attacks less potent, but it is not enough to allow Rider to go without Breaker Gorgon in their presence. Repeating the initial surprise effect would be impossible, making it possible to act without going completely numb and causing the effect of the petrification to go at a slower rate. The effect will be magnified again should the person's guard be let down. It is possible to cancel the effect if it has not reached a certain point by closing her eyes. In the case of a lessened effect like when Shirou accidentally walks on her bathing, it starts to spread up his legs and is too far gone to simply close her eyes, but she is able to cancel the effect by sealing them with Breaker Gorgon. It takes some time for the petrification to recede, and she mentions that it would have been bad had it affected his heart.Riding  With her Riding skills, she can ride on animals and vehicles, allowing her to mount creatures on the level of Phantasmal Beasts and Divine Beasts. She uses an unlisted, innate ability to bring forth the Pegasus given to her by Poseidon, initially thought by Shirou to be her main Noble Phantasm. It actually lacks any sort of name, and it is treated much in the same manner as her dagger. Having remained since the Age of Gods, its abilities are far beyond those of a normal Pegasus that would only be limited to the strength of a several hundred years old Monstrous Beast had it been one of the few remaining Phantasmal Species from the current age. Increasing in strength as it has lived, it has the strength of a Phantasmal Beast far beyond something like Invisible Air that could defeat a normal Pegasus. If left without the ability to readily use a strong Noble Phantasm, it easily overwhelms Saber and leaves her in a position to only bide her time and wait for a mistake on Rider's handling. Its strength is nearing that of the level of dragons, the strongest of the Phantasmal Species, and its defense has already reached that level. It is made of enough energy to have come from several hundred magi, and constantly emits it while it flies. It is a divine mystery with magical protection even greater than that of Saber, who displays the strongest resistance of the Holy Grail War, allowing it to easily brush past all thaumaturgy without issue. Not needing to halt its charge against anything, it is much like a giant castle wall crashing down on the opponent and leaving them no method of dodging or defending. Too powerful to defend against, even the trail of its charge is enough to damage a Servant. It destroys its surroundings just by moving, scorching the area around it. The buffets from its wings are capable of generating massive shock waves, which raze infrastructures and lacerate the bodies of living beings. Despite displaying this overwhelming ability, it is a docile being unfit for combat. For it to truly attack, she must use Bellerophon to compel it. It is brought forth by slashing her neck with her dagger, allowing the blood to spray out and stop in the air to form a magic circle. The circle, which displays a creature-like figure, swells with a large amount of magical energy that makes up the Pegasus, far surpassing Blood Fort Andromeda. Pegasus then emerges from a giant eye bound by blood, and she can either immediately mount it to use Bellerophon right out of the summoning circle or have it fight for a time before strategically using it. Once in the air, she can constantly attack the enemy and move from their range without coming close to the ground to leave them bereft of any method of counterattack or form of pursuit, but its speed would make it impossible to catch even with a method to follow it. Preparing her final strike, she can use Bellerophon at any time to cut all of the its limiters. Rider likes the recreational use of bicycles, but suffers from the fact that she endlessly accelerates to the point of breaking them. Even for a \"granny bike\" like the one used for shopping at the Emiya household, she could easily ride it at 100\u00a0km/h when it is only meant to peak at 20\u00a0km/h. She yearns for a racing bike like that belonging to Shirou that can allow her to reach even higher speeds with its gear system, wishing she could use Mana Burst to help with its control. If utilizing a motorcycle, she can match up against Grand Prix motorcycle former champion, Wayne Gardner.Development  Hirokazu Koyama felt a lot of intense motivation to make the art work when Saber was chasing Rider up the side of a building. There were a lot of fine details in the drawing and it was a lot of work to get the scene right for him. They ended up with some drawings of Rider rising up into the air and falling and Saber descending. However, recently Koyama image has changed. He drew the image of the building as if it was crashing to bits, and in front of it he drew Saber using her Excalibur Noble Phantasm as it rose from the building. Saber used a beam to intercept the charging attack by Pegasus, but it was a close shave. If Saber had tried to use a melee attack, she would have been struck down. That's why he wanted to focus attention on the beam as it blasted off of the rooftop.Creation and Conception  In the original plot of Fate, Rider was a male character. In Rider's earlier design, Takashi Takeuchi initial drawing shows her appearance similar to Ayako Mitsuduri. Kinoko Nasu really wanted to have a scene in the Sakura route where she and Saber bickered with each other as they fought toward a common goal, but unfortunately the story didn't develop in that direction and Nasu had to discard the idea.Reception  Noriko Shitaya (Voice actress of Sakura Matou) said her first impression of Rider based on her first recording, to be scary and cold-blooded. In reality Rider turned out to be Sakura's most stalwart and dedicated supporter. Now Shitaya thinks of her as an elder sister. Rider didn't have anyone to rely on; instead she desperately tried to protect her own world. Rider has a big presence. Shitaya joked about she was not jealous that she didn't get an awesome Servant of the opposite sex the way that Emiya and Rin did.References English  User: Rider\nThe weapon favored by Rider. Called a \u201cdagger\u201d, but it might be more accurate to describe it as a \u201cnail\u201d that pierces the opponent.

The original group were those of the Dead Apostles who escaped from their role as the \"emergency rations\" of the True Ancestors, but it currently refers to the distinct factions amongst the Dead Apostles due to some having been succeeded by new generations of Dead Apostles. Some of the originals, more than half, have been sealed away by the Church and some have been annihilated, changing the leadership of the different factions throughout the generations as they have been replaced, while others still reign as Ancestors in the present era. There are some missing numbers yet to be replaced, as they have been executed by the Church, sealed by the Church, or they are atoning for their sins. The sealed Ancestors are stored in coffins within the Church under eternal imprisonment because they are unable to be totally destroyed. The factions following these Ancestors are still in good condition without their leaders, and they are currently gaining strength to either take back their Ancestor or destroy them. Those who are over four thousand years old from the Age of Gods are referred to as the Elder Title: League of the Age of Gods\u00a0(\u795e\u4ee3\u9023\u76df\uff08\u30a8\u30eb\u30c0\u30fc\u30bf\u30a4\u30c8\u30eb\uff09). There are those who favored establishing kingdoms consisting of Territories, Dead Apostles, and the Dead, and there are some exceptional members who possess neither a Territory nor a coven. The oldest favor Territories, whereas those who transformed from the culmination of pursuing magecraft have little interest in such power. The main reason why the group remains in some form after years of repeated killing and destruction among each other and hunts from the Church is because one Ancestor acts as the prophet. Declaring the Rose Prophecy\u00a0(\u8594\u8587\u306e\u4e88\u8a00), she always foresees the death of those Ancestors and warns them so they may prepare a successor immediately. Louvre was given the message \"--Tonight, Death will appear before thee\" around three hours before his death. They are mainly non-aggressive against one another, and there are two main factions in the present. They can be considered an organization with power rivaling the Church and Mage's Association. The grouping only exists in Tsukihime Worlds, so it is not present in Fate Worlds. The Dead Apostles who would make up the grouping still exist in Fate Worlds, but their activities and statuses may differ. In Fate worlds, Zepia Eltnam Oberon never becomes the Night of Wallachia, and Gransurg Blackmore dies in some event over one thousand years before modern times. They are often called Superior Dead Apostles\u00a0(\u4e0a\u7d1a\u6b7b\u5f92) instead.Attributes  They are very powerful beings, and many have the ability to utilize Reality Marbles. Their general rankings are not determined exclusively by how powerful he or she is individually, but rather the paramount danger he or she poses to humanity. Those within the first ten ranks cannot be defeated by normal concepts, as they, themselves, are fantasy much like members of the Phantasmal Species. Those who live in fantasy can only be defeated by fantasy that is greater than themselves. Furthermore, for those who have reached the Ancestor class, it is possible to exist as a phantom even after losing the physical body. Those who have completely lost their original bodies are Nrvnqsr Chaos, Stanrobe Calhin, Night of Wallachia, Gransurg Blackmore, Caubac Alcatraz, and Michael Roa Valdamjong. They are, on average, capable of facing Servants in battle, but, as both are types of beings that live in Mystery, such battles would come down to \"having the means of killing the other guy somehow.\" Servants will generally hold a slight advantage, barring compatibility issues, and the Knight classes, Saber, Archer, and Lancer, will all be able to have solid fights. Though Saber's Excalibur is extremely effective against those who overwhelm by material quantity and alienness, there are those capable of surviving being hit by Excalibur-class attacks through pure endurance. At the same time, those same ones with extreme endurance would have a tough time with Lancer's Gae Bolg.ORT, to which Earth's rules do not apply, and Primate Murder can be called in a league of their own above both Ancestors and Servants. The qualifications to be considered part of the group are rather loose, as it includes Dead Apostles created by Crimson Moon himself, magi who became vampires through their own magical powers, and even blood-sucking creatures other than Dead Apostles. Although Michael Roa Valdamjong is seen as an Ancestor, being an original one created by the White Princess, he is ranked as \"Extra\" outside of the regular twenty-seven because they consider him to be a heretic who does not uphold the ideals of regular vampires. Arcueid Brunestud considers them to be a group of twenty-eight, but the rest of the group do not due to Roa seeking eternity outside of the partial immortality granted upon becoming a Dead Apostle.Aylesbury Valesti  One major event for the Ancestors is the Aylesbury Valesti\u00a0(\u30a2\u30eb\u30ba\u30d9\u30ea\u30fb\u30d0\u30ec\u30b9\u30c6\u30a4\u30f3) ritual established by Crimson Moon that involves the revival of The Dark Six. It is a grand ritual the Ancestors have been preparing for decades, and it has come together in Aylesbury over the last ten years. It is suggested that the ritual, performed much earlier in the 1970s for unknown reasons, resulted in the world's mana being dried up in Fate/Extra. Due to the development being funded and developed entirely by human means, the Mage's Association and Church are unable to intervene until the advent of the ritual. The ritual is the earnest desires for all Dead Apostles, and at least six Ancestors will be participating. Those more recent ones from magus backgrounds are not able to attend, limiting it to only the very old Dead Apostles. Only those with \"original blood\" will be invited, including Ortenrosse, who is running it, Altrouge, Van-Fem, Merem Solomon, and Blackmore. As Ortenrosse is leading it, there are no Ancestors capable of declining. Van-Fem has only provided capital without actually actively working with it. Merem has no interest in the \"old fashioned\" ritual, only wishing to stop it as a member of the Church and kill Altrouge, and before the importance of the ritual, Blackmore wishes to kill her as well. They are both willing to work together on killing her before attempting to kill each other.List of the Twenty-seven Dead Apostle Ancestors  The list may change upon the release of the Tsukihime remake because some will have been removed in order to redevelop the concept for later works.References ", "Brave Frontier Wiki": "Brave Frontier Wiki ", "Tower of Saviors \u7dad\u57fa": "Tower of Saviors \u7dad\u57fa ", "Choices: Stories You Play Wikia": "Choices: Stories You Play Wikia ", "Xenoblade Wiki": "Xenoblade Wiki Xenoblade Wiki WARNING!

Reconstruction is divided into Housing, Commerce, Nature, and Special, and each of these has five levels of development. The party receives rare items as rewards for each level of completion. As the colony is rebuilt, the party can invite people from other regions to migrate to the colony. Colony 6 Reconstruction is not considered a Quest and will not appear in the quest log. However, like quests, visions can be received upon picking up items necessary for the reconstruction, and those items will subsequently be marked with exclamation points in the inventory.Extras Quest (XC1)  Quests are a collection of requests in Xenoblade Chronicles that the many people of Bionis and Mechonis ask of the party, or that are automatically triggered in the course of the story. Most quests do not need to be completed to advance the story, but some do. There are also Timed Quests, which must be completed before a certain point in the story, such as the refugees moving back to Colony 6 or before the destruction of Galahad Fortress. There are also some Mutually Exclusive Quests, where the party must choose one option or the other; depending on the choice, the Affinity Chart will grow differently. There are also some Story Quests and a few Surprise Quests that will appear during the progression of the story. Quests can vary from delivering letters to defeating monsters that roam Bionis and Mechonis. Very rare items and experience points can be acquired from them. Altogether, there are 480 quests, 130 are timed quests, 50 are mutually exclusive quests (M.E.) (that to say 25 mutually exclusive to each other), 12 are surprise quests, and 31 are story quests.Infobox  On the Xenoblade Wiki, all quests have an infobox on their page containing information about them, as shown below.Type of Quests Colony 9 Quests  This page lists all the quests available in Colony 9. The list may be viewed in the order they become available or the order they appear in the Quest Log. For simplicity, this page does not list additional prerequisites such as NPCs being registered on the Affinity Chart or having a certain affinity link with one another. Terms and abbreviations are explained in the legend at the bottom of the page.Availability Order  This table is divided into sections based on the point in the story at which they become available (if other prerequisites are met). Quests within each section are sorted by the Area Affinity required.Fiora  Fiora (Japanese: \u30d5\u30a3\u30aa\u30eb\u30f3, Fiorun, Fiorung; English dub: /fi\u02c8\u0254\u0259r\u0259/) is one of the seven playable characters in Xenoblade Chronicles. She is a childhood friend of Shulk and Reyn, and is the younger sister of Dunban with whom she lives in his house in Colony 9. She has a soft spot for Shulk and often cooks for him, for which he is grateful.Appearance  Fiora is young woman of average stature (about 160 cm, or 5'3\") and has rounded green eyes. Fiora has long blonde hair that falls just past her shoulders and a somewhat petite frame. However, despite her delicate frame Fiora is displayed to be rather physically fit. Fiora's starting outfit consists of a small top that reveals her midriff but conceals the navel. She wears a short skirt and long leggings. After the events of Galahad Fortress, Fiora has a different appearance with a mechanised body; she now possesses a skin-tight white partial exoskeleton and a shorter haircut.Personality  Fiora has been shown to be a very kind and caring person who wants to help everyone. She is also a pacifist, as she pleads with Egil to stop his plans, even to going as far to forgive him before any other person within the party does. Fiora is also incredibly protective of Shulk, to the point where she does not even trust Reyn with his safety. Fiora is an energetic, cheerful and playful person. She has been shown to be able to read people rather easily, such as when she predicted Reyn and Shulk would forget the Ether canisters and when she reads peoples' emotions in her Heart-to-Hearts. This trait has allowed her to get to know every member of the party extremely fast, possibly indicating that she can make friends easily. The byproduct of this trait is that Fiora can convey and show her emotions easily and does frequently, however she tends to show all of her emotions. Despite being a careful person, Fiora will occasionally take rather reckless actions time to time, such as when she charged at Metal Face with a vehicle, an act that ultimately got her killed. She notes this in a Heart-to-Heart with Dunban and vows not to make the same mistake again. Fiora will do nearly anything to help people, but she often does so without thinking about how everyone will feel after the fact. In some heart-to-hearts, it is implied that Fiora is in fact very scared about the situations she is in, but puts on a brave face so she does not feel like a dead weight. This trait further develops near the story's climax as starts to verbally express that she is a dead weight to everyone. Throughout the story, Fiora is a calm and collected person, rarely showing any form of anger.Abilities  In battle, Fiora attacks using a set of twin knives or daggers. She is a fast attacker with good abilities. She is slightly weaker than Shulk in terms of offensive prowess. After the events at Galahad Fortress, Fiora becomes proficient with dual swords, and becomes heavily dependent on auto-attacks for high damage due to the speed of her swings. Although she can have the best damage per second on single targets, she can also double as an agile tank with the right armour and Arts Palette. Outside of battle it is stated that she is a good cook; though according to her, Shulk never seems to really appreciate it. Dunban implies during \"Brother and Sister\" that she is also very bad at directions and gets lost easily, which she replies is no longer a problem since she now has built-in radar. One ability that is shown and never properly explained is that she is somehow able to refuel and pilot a Mobile Artillery without assistance. It is unclear how she learned to do this as she is not a part of the Colony 9 Defence Force and never received proper and necessary training, however it is plausible that, being very close to Shulk, he was able to impart her some knowledge about engineering and machine operating, seeing as she catches up with him and Reyn to bring them the transport cases for the ether cylinders in Tephra Cave. During The Oath Sword, it is implied that Fiora was once considered for the Defence Force. In addition, if Colonel Vangarre is talked to as Fiora before completing the Story Quest, Delivering Food, in Colony 9, he expresses kindness towards her and says that she is a hard worker.Story  Fiora assists Shulk and Reyn in collecting replacement cylinders for the Mobile Artillery and fighting off the Mechon when they attack Colony 9. During this attack, Fiora is separated from Shulk and Reyn and finds a Mobile Artillery that had previously crashed into a house. She pilots it, firing off several rounds of ammunition at Metal Face. She then charges Metal Face head on, blasting the artillery's main cannon at point-blank range. Despite all this, Metal Face takes very little damage and stabs Fiora, apparently killing her. Eventually, the Mechon raiders call back their troops and Metal Face is forced to leave. After the assault ends, Dunban comments that Fiora would not have wished for Shulk to feel remorse for her loss, as she died defending him. Later, at Prison Island, it is revealed that she has been given the body of a machine to replace her damaged organic one and was turned into a silver-faced Mechon named Face Nemesis. She seemed to have no memory of her past life in Colony 9, however. She is next seen on Valak Mountain stating that she must speak to Shulk. Their conversation is immediately interrupted by Metal Face, who is revealed to be Mumkhar. Mumkhar wants the Monado for himself and threatens to kill Fiora if Shulk does not hand it over to him, which Shulk does. They proceed to battle until the true leader of Mechonis, Egil, arrives and stops them. Egil then takes Fiora and her Faced Mechon back to Galahad Fortress. At Galahad Fortress the party is forced to fight both Fiora and Egil. Eventually, Fiora's consciousness gives Face Nemesis the strength to break free of Egil's will and she destroys half of Galahad Fortress, sending Shulk and the others plummeting to the Fallen Arm in the process. After a heartfelt reunion with Shulk, during which she mentions another consciousness inside her, whom she believes needs help, she rejoins the party as the seventh party member. It is soon revealed that her separate consciousness is actually Meyneth, the soul of Mechonis, who had been implanted in Fiora by Vanea, Egil's sister. Afterwards, it is seen that her mechanised body is only being kept alive through Meyneth's power dwelling within her. When Meyneth is killed by Zanza, it is made clear that Fiora does not have long to live inside her new body. Fiora purposely tries to withhold this from Shulk so that she can continue to assist the party and spare him emotional distress. Following the credits, the player sees the new world through Fiora's perspective until she finds Shulk. Here, it is revealed that she has been turned back into a Homs, though still keeping her short haircut. After asking Shulk which style he prefers, he answers that he likes her just the way she is. It is revealed in a short story from Xenoblade: The Secret File - Monado Archives that sometime between the events at the Mechonis Core and the ending scene, Linada informs Shulk of the possible existence of an ancient High Entia regeneration chamber which will give Fiora back her old body. However, Fiora must go into the chamber for six months. Shulk discovers the Regeneration Chamber behind a locked door in the cylinder hanger after having seen Melia, now queen of the High Entia, commanding it to open in a vision. Fiora refuses to go into the chamber until the party defeats Zanza, knowing that she would not be able to help them in her old body. Once Zanza has been destroyed, Fiora enters the chamber; however, the game does not show this. The final cutscene takes place after Fiora's half year in the regeneration chamber.General stats  \u203b These stats are raw and do not include the bonuses from the skill lines.Arts Original arts Skill trees  Fiora has the following Skill Trees:Courage  Courage is one of Fiora's initial three skill trees.

The game was announced during E3 2009, when a trailer was released to media. The trailer shows a futuristic sword-wielding character battling giant robots and creatures as well as third-person exploration gameplay. In January 2010, the game was renamed from Monado: Beginning of the World to Xenoblade to honor Tetsuya Takahashi, \"who poured his soul into making this and who has been working on the Xeno series\". The game was released on June 10, 2010 in Japan, and released on August 19, 2011 in PAL regions. The game was released in North America on April 6, 2012.Gameplay  The game conveys the feeling of freedom to the player through large, open environments, and is not as focused on cutscenes and story as its sibling games Xenogears and Xenosaga. Xenoblade Chronicles has an action-based battle system where normal attacks will happen automatically at intervals, similar to the set up in Final Fantasy XII. However, everything else is done manually, including movement of the character the player is using, which plays an integral role into Shulk's special attacks. Special attacks recharge separately when used and are set by the player on a \"battle palette\" at the bottom of the screen. The game also has the \"Visions\" system, where the player can see glimpses of the future, and try to react or prevent it from happening. The game has a number of features labeled as \"Time Saving Support Features\". For instance, while the game has a day and night time cycle, players can \"wind the clock\" to the time they want to go to, rather than just letting time elapse. Additionally, while the game is about exploration, many warp points have been added to aid in traversing the land. The game also sports a \"save anywhere\" feature, a feature relatively rare among the console RPG genre. Another of the game's systems is the \"affinity system,\" in which characters can partake in many optional sidequests with non-player characters. Completing such quests can alter perception of the character in the towns, and open up additional story sequences. The game has extensive customization, such as being able to change the character's outfits, and having those changes be seen in battle, field, and even event scenes.Xenoblade Chronicles 3D  Xenoblade Chronicles was also ported onto the New Nintendo 3DS, known as Xenoblade Chronicles 3D. This port was developed by Monster Games and is not compatible with previous Nintendo 3DS models. The game is displayed on both screens. A new feature consists of using the bottom screen as a map, as well as displaying party member information such as the Level, the HP, the character's portrait with the reflected Tension change and the inflicted Status Effect. The new Collection Mode is another new feature allowing the ability to view the game's 3D models from any angle in the Model Viewer, and listen to the musical score in the Jukebox via a token based lottery. The Shulk amiibo can be scanned daily to unlock twenty-one tokens each week (three tokens per day). In Japan the first print run included the 1-CD Special Soundtrack.Xenoblade Chronicles Wii U eShop  The downloadable Wii version of Xenoblade Chronicles was released on the Wii U eShop on August 5, 2015 in PAL territories, on April 28, 2016 in Americas, and on July 27, 2016 in Japan. The downloadable digital distribution takes up 6588.0 MB of hard disk space. The game is fully playable on either the Gamepad using off-TV play, or on the TV, and does not require a Wii Remote. By buying the game on the eShop, Nintendo of Europe offered \u20ac10/\u00a39 off Xenoblade Chronicles X bought on the eShop during the two weeks following its release in December 2015.Reception  Famitsu awarded the game 9/9/9/9 in its review, totaling 36/40. Xenoblade Chronicles debuted at #1 in its week of release in Japan, selling 83,000 copies. It was also voted the third most interesting game released in Japan during the first half of 2010 in a survey conducted by Dengeki.Awards Merchandise  Several tie-in products have been released. These include:External Links Shulk  Shulk (Japanese: \u30b7\u30e5\u30eb\u30af, Shuruku; English dub: /\u02c8\u0283\u028alk/) is the main protagonist of Xenoblade Chronicles. He likes to think things through and is very methodical in his approach to most situations. He was one of the only known survivors on a previous expedition to retrieve the Monado, and as a young man has become a budding researcher set on unlocking the sword's secrets. He first wields the sacred weapon when his home, Colony 9, is attacked by Mechon.Personality  As the main hero of Xenoblade Chronicles, Shulk is a young man with strong qualities. He is determined, organized, strong-hearted, smart, kind, and quick to the bone. Despite losing his parents at a young age, Shulk was still surrounded by people who cared about him, and he cared for those people in return. His kindness has been noted by several characters, most notably Fiora, who states that this is the main reason she fell in love with him. However, his kindness has its limits, and he shows a very vengeful side when he witnesses Fiora's apparent death at the hands of Metal Face, after which he vows to kill him and all other Mechon. Initially, Shulk saw his ability to see the future as a burden, particularly after witnessing Fiora's demise and being completely helpless as he saw it come true. After the fight with the Arachno Queen in Tephra Cave, however, he realises that the future he sees is not set, and that he can use his power to change it. Nevertheless, there are still several occasions where he sees the future but is unable to do anything about it, which frustrates him deeply. As a result, he can be quite the pessimist, as noted by D\u00e9sir\u00e9e, though she adds that it shows how much he cares for others. Shulk easily gets along with almost anyone he fights alongside with; his team-mates in particular. For example, he and Reyn have treated each other as brothers ever since they were children. The two have a shared oath of covering each others' backs on everything and, despite their vastly differing personalities, they almost never argue, Reyn claims that he can count the number of times they have argued on one hand. He looks up to Dunban as a mentor as well as a second-in-command of the team; he gets along with Fiora very well, especially since the two share mutual feelings for each other. As shown in the field, Shulk is also very protective of everyone. He seems to take it personally if anyone gets hurt during battle. He also asks everyone how they are holding up, even when the case is the other way around.Gameplay  Aside from the Monado arts, Shulk has very few normal arts (only eight) compared to every other permanently playable character (about fifteen moves each). Most of his arts revolve around positioning, requiring other party members to draw aggro away from him in order for his arts to gain additional power or effects, and this makes him weaker when fighting enemies head-on, as his arts require him to wait for openings. However, he can call upon the power of the Monado, which can stock another eight skills unique to the Monado itself, and all of his moves are useful in a variety of ways, including giving useful buffs and protecting his entire party from harm with a single Monado Art. He also has the third lowest HP of the playable cast, above Melia and slightly more than Sharla, but his Strength and Agility greatly balance out this flaw. An important note is that after gaining the Monado, Shulk cannot switch weapons. This works both for and against him. Whenever a point in the story occurs where Shulk gains a new Art for the Monado, its damage will increase. This means at times he will jump ahead of the other characters in terms of damage, but they will eventually catch up to him.Story  Late in the game it is revealed that Shulk had been killed along with his parents during the Monado expedition and that Zanza had possessed his body and laid dormant within. The revived Shulk was then found by Dickson, who recognized him as the resting Zanza's new vessel and took him to Colony 9 along with the Monado. Shulk was thus able to grow up with Dickson looking after him, unaware that he was a pawn in the plan to revive Zanza. It is in fact because of Zanza residing within Shulk that Shulk is able to wield the Monado to its full potential and is not harmed by its use like other Homs. When Shulk confronts Egil and ultimately chooses to spare him, Dickson intervenes and shoots Shulk. As Shulk falls unconscious, Zanza leaves his body and takes the Monado into his own hands before taking control of the Bionis. Shulk, left in a comatose state, is taken back to Colony 6 aboard Junks. Within his mind, Shulk struggles to find the will to continue on, but manages to find his way again with the help of Alvis and is revived. Upon awaking, Shulk receives a replica Monado built by the Machina and manages to help fend off a Telethia attack on Colony 6, where he learns that Alvis is also an disciple for Zanza. Aiming to stop Zanza, Shulk and his allies journey through the Bionis' Interior and Prison Island, defeating the other disciples, Lorithia and Dickson in the process. From there, Shulk's party enters Memory Space and confronts Zanza. During their final battle, Shulk awakens to the power of a new Monado, his True Monado, and uses it to strike Zanza down. At the game's end, it is revealed by Alvis that Shulk has become a third god on par with Zanza and Meyneth, and is given the chance to decree the fate of the world. Hesitant to take on such a responsibility at first, in the end Shulk wishes for a world without gods, and the world is reborn once more, with new, Earth-like landmasses. The fallen body of Bionis can still be seen in the distance from Colony 9's place on the new world, now inhabited by all of the beings of Bionis and Mechonis.General stats  \u203b These stats are raw and do not include the bonuses from the skill lines.Arts  For information on leveling battle arts, see Levelling Battle Arts.Monado Arts Skill trees  Shulk has the following Skill Trees:Integrity  Integrity is one of Shulk's initial three skill trees, and the first skill is unlocked at the start of the game.

It is revealed that his final confrontation with Zanza is synchronous with Rex's arrival to Elysium and meeting with the Architect, the other half of Zanza's original persona. The Architect feels that the demise of Zanza is near, and it will lead to his own end as well. During the cutscene \"To Find a Way Forward\", Shulk can be heard saying \"Today, we use our power to fell a god, and then seize our destiny!\". With Zanza's defeat, the Architect feels that he will slowly follow Zanza, and encourages Rex and the rest of the party to stop Malos.Challenge Battle Mode  Shulk and Fiora make an appearance in Challenge Battle Mode, released as part of Version 1.5.0 for players with the Expansion Pass. In it, the two appear as Blades; like Poppibuster, they can freely switch between Drivers (excluding Tora) without the need of an Overdrive Protocol. However, they cannot be taken out of the Land of Challenge until the party receives the Alrest Linkring. Shulk uses the light element, wields the Monado, and acts as an Attacker in battle. For this appearance, Shulk was redesigned by Kunihiko Tanaka, lead character designer for Xenoblade Chronicles X, as well as the Xenogears and Xenosaga series. In the English dub of Xenoblade Chronicles 2, the original pronunciation for Shulk's name from Xenoblade Chronicles (/\u02c8\u0283\u028alk/) can still be heard, but an alternate pronunciation (/\u02c8\u0283\u028clk/) can also be heard.As a Blade Favorite Items In Super Smash Bros.  Shulk is a playable character in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS / Wii U and its sequel Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. His Neutral Special move gives him the ability to change his attributes in battle using his Monado Arts; Speed, Shield and Buster from Xenoblade Chronicles and two new Arts, Jump and Smash, invented for the sake of Smash Bros.Moveset  Shulk's Neutral Special uses his Monado Arts: In Super Smash Bros. Ultimate a Monado Art can be selected rather than switching between each one. Shulk's Up Special move is Air Slash, a rising slash with an optional second slash. Shulk's Side Special move is Back Slash. It does more damage if it hits the back, similarly to the Art's effect in Xenoblade Chronicles. Shulk's Down Special move is Vision, in which he foresees an opponent's attack, dodges, and counterattacks. Vision can be altered to launch the opponent behind Shulk. His Final Smash is a Chain Attack with Dunban and Riki. In Super Smash Bros. Ultimate Fiora is added to this Final Smash. Some of Shulk's neutral attacks in this game also bear resemblance to other arts that he and other party members in Xenoblade Chronicles used, two notable examples being his forward smash's similarity to Slit Edge and his down smash's to War Swing, one of Reyn's arts.amiibo  Nintendo released a Shulk amiibo as part of the third wave of amiibo figures. In the US the Shulk figure was exclusive to retailer Game Stop at launch, but was made available at Best Buy retailers in October 2015. It is not exclusive to any retailer in Europe or Japan.

She is a powerful mage-like character who lives in the Royal City of Alcamoth prior to the game's events. Her true age is unknown in the game, though her half-brother Kallian is 151 years old. However the art book \"Xenoblade: The Secret File\" reveals her age to be 88. Riki calls her \"Melly\", while the resident Nopon of Frontier Village call her by the term \"Bird Lady\". Her Arts mainly focus on summoning elemental spirits and affecting enemies with her ether staff. Melia is the daughter of the High Entia Emperor Sorean Antiqua and his second consort. Imperial tradition states that the emperor take two consorts; one a High Entia, and the other a Homs. Melia, daughter of the Homs second consort, is of mixed High Entia and Homs heritage. Melia's mother is never seen and is only alluded to in dialogue as, due to the difference in the rate of aging between Homs and High Entia, she died of old age sometime before the events of the game. An NPC in the imperial palace however does state that Melia has grown up to resemble the second consort as a young woman.Personality  Despite her status as the princess (later Empress) of the most advanced race on Bionis, Melia is a very humble, modest and kind person, never once looking down on Homs as inferior beings, though this may partially be because she is half-Homs herself. When Shulk, Dunban, Reyn and Sharla first meet her, Melia slaps Shulk for touching her, suggesting that she was brought up with traditional values. She instantly apologises and offers to help the Homs in exchange for saving her life. Initially, Melia was very reluctant to accept the Homs' help to take down the Telethia who killed her comrades, insisting she was perfectly capable of doing it herself and did not need any assistance. Whether this was because of pride, grief over her friends' sacrifices or a simple desire not to get strangers involved is open to interpretation. However, she reluctantly accepted their help after Chief Dunga provided the group with Riki, having come to realise her limits. She was also very sceptical about the Monado at first, believing Shulk's ability to see the future was rubbish. Only after the group defeated the Telethia did she finally grow accepting of its power. Being a princess and due to a fairly strict upbringing, Melia is partial to polite and formal behaviour, and one of the most serious members of the group along with Dunban. In spite of this, she retains a sense of humour and does not seem to mind Riki calling her \"Melly\". However, when she jokes, she normally does so with a completely straight face, so people, particularly Reyn, usually think she is being serious, as shown in a Heart-to-Heart when she jokingly demands that Colony 9 pays Alcamoth for their use of Ether Cylinders from the Ancient Wreckage, which Melia deducts to be a crashed High Entia ship.Story  Melia is first seen fighting a large flying creature, later revealed to be the Leone Telethia, accompanied by four knights called Aizel, Hogard, Garan, and Damil. The knights are killed and Melia left unconscious and on the verge of death in Makna Forest. When Shulk and his friends find her, Sharla diagnoses that she is suffering from ether depletion. In order to save her, they have to gather pure Ether Crystals. Shulk heads to the Great Makna Falls to gather them and is attacked by Telethia spawn. Upon Shulk's return, Sharla revives Melia by shooting the ether crystals near her body. Melia refuses to explain her reason for being in Makna Forest, but decides to accompany them temporarily and leads them to Frontier Village. When Shulk mentions his battle with the Telethia, Melia is surprised and refuses to believe in Shulk's visions. Only after defeating the Telethia and avenging her fallen allies does she come to accept his power. After returning to Frontier Village, Melia decides to officially join the group and they continue on to Eryth Sea. Upon the group's arrival in Alcamoth, it is revealed that Melia is High Entia royalty and the Emperor's chosen successor, with the additional support and blessing of her brother Kallian. However, the decision to declare Melia as Sorean's successor does not sit well with the first consort, Kallian's mother, who resents Melia due to her half-Homs heritage as the daughter of the second consort. It is at this point that Melia becomes the target of an assassination attempt. At the first consort's suggestion, Melia is sent to perform an ancient trial in the High Entia Tomb in order to prove herself worthy as the successor. Melia completes the trial and is deemed worthy by the forefathers to become the imperial successor in spite of her half-Homs ancestry. It is at this point that an assassin hired by the emperor's first consort attempts to kill Melia with the aid of a Telethia, but is thwarted by Shulk's group. After Melia is declared successor in a public ceremony, Mechon attack Alcamoth and Sorean travels to Prison Island. Melia accompanies Shulk's party in giving chase, but they are unable to prevent the emperor's death. Following the events on Prison Island, Melia is due to officially ascend to the throne, but her coronation is delayed for one year, allowing her time to travel with Shulk's party to seek her own vengeance for the death of her father. In the meantime, her brother Kallian serves as regent while an impersonator of unknown identity is prepared to fill in for Melia's public appearances during her absence. Following the events at the Mechonis Core, Zanza sinks Prison Island into Eryth Sea and floods Alcamoth with ether. The action transforms the vast majority of its citizens into Telethia. Lorithia and Dickson confront Melia and the rest of Shulk's party as they attempt to escape aboard Junks, but the party is saved when Kallian and High Entia forces fly in to combat the traitors. However, Kallian and his forces are in turn exposed to high concentrations of ether and transformed, but Melia is spared from transforming due to her Homs ancestry. Later, Melia and the party travel to the Bionis' Interior, where they confront Lorithia, who keeps the now mindless Telethia form of Kallian under her command. After Lorithia is defeated, Kallian is released from his existence as a Telethia and is able to share tender parting words that only Melia and Riki can hear.Abilities  Melia's abilities are based upon Ether Arts, being a mage-like character with low health and physical strength, while excelling in ether combat and defense, making her very useful against enemies with high physical defense or specialize in ether attacks. Her main arts do not immediately damage opponents: rather, they produce an elemental summon, which float above her head with a specific spherical design, and give off an aura that increases the party's stats while they are in the vicinity of Melia. Up to three of these summons can be in play at the same time, including three of the same summons which will subsequently stack their effects, for example three Aqua summons for high health regeneration. Her Talent Art Elemental Discharge effectively uses the elementals she has summoned to attack. This means that Melia's main form of dealing damage is to summon and then release these elements, while she can also opt to keep the elements passively active to buff her party members. Every released summon that attacks an enemy fills her Talent Gauge, allowing her to enter Element Burst state when maxed, granting her access to some powerful abilities as well as doubling damage caused. Element Burst may be completely used up upon casting an Art; the higher her tension, the more likely she can stay in Element Burst after casting an Art. Melia starts off with several Arts, mostly summons that grant increased power for the party: they are Bolt, Flare and Aqua (which grant the buffs of Ether Up, Strength Up and Regenerate, respectively). She learns defensive Art summons later on, which include Wind, Earth and Ice (which give Agility Up, Physical Defence Up and Ether Defence Up, respectively), along with Summon Copy, an Art that summons the previously summoned element, even if the Art is on cooldown. Similarly, she also has a few spells that cause statuses on enemies. She can inflict Sleep using a special hypnosis spell, heal a party member at the cost of her own health, launch Shadow Stitch to bind the foes' movement, and even Topple a single target by herself at close range with a sequence of Spear Break and Starlight Kick. Once she reaches Element Burst state, she can gain two single-use abilities, either Burst End art to decrease both Physical and Ether defences, or Mind Blast to seal enemy arts for a period of time, a status ailments that other party members are unable to cause themselves.General stats  \u203b These stats are raw and do not include the bonuses from the skill lines.Arts  Many of Melia's arts provide a buff when summoned and do damage when released. This is noted thus in the list below: (group buff when summoned | damage when released)Skill trees  Melia has the following Skill Trees:Serenity  Serenity is one of Melia's initial three skill trees, and the first skill is unlocked when she joins the party.

When Linada is not around (this can only take place at midnight), Melia can repeatedly speak to the unconscious Shulk for some dialogue regarding her feelings towards him, and also receive a big heart's worth of affinity (probably 300 affinity points like the big heart granting at the end of the Heart-to-Hearts). It appears that Melia was going to do something to the unconscious Shulk, perhaps a kiss, but she would later be ashamed had she not stopped herself.Quotes \u200bCharacter yells Shulk Reyn Fiora Dunban Sharla Riki Vision Warnings Dialogue Trivia Alcamoth Quests  This page lists all the quests available in Alcamoth.

Sharla was due to marry a member of Colony 6's Defence Force, named Gadolt. Unfortunately, the Mechon attacked, led by Xord, and destroyed Colony 6. Sharla and Juju were tasked with helping the young and elderly flee the Colony. It is at the Refugee Camp that Sharla meets Shulk and Reyn. She almost immediately takes a liking to Reyn but has trouble believing that Shulk can witness the future. When Juju runs away the three give chase, and Sharla reveals her specialty is healing. They eventually reach Juju, who has been captured by a Mechon M71, and defeat it. During this battle, Sharla realizes that Shulk's visions are real. Unfortunately for Sharla, their victory is short-lived as Xord appears and terrorizes the group. He kidnaps Juju, causing Sharla to faint from the ordeal for about four hours. Upon recovering, Sharla leads the party through the Ether Mine, below Colony 6, and they find Xord. When she finds that Xord ate the entire Defence Force, she swears not to stop until she scraps every last Mechon around her. After the battle, she is asked to accompany Shulk on his journey. She also receives Gadolt's Rifle from Otharon.Battle  In battle, Sharla is mainly a healer. She uses a rifle as a weapon, and she is the first person to have a decent offensive Ether attack. Sharla's use of a rifle gives her auto-attacks and arts much greater reach than most of the other characters, but it has a fairly low attack rate and her rifle needs to Cool Off after using her arts a certain amount of times. When Sharla is using Cool Off, her talent art, she cannot move or attack and any aura that she had previously active will be cancelled. Cool Off can be initiated at any time to clear the talent gauge, saving a significant amount of time from allowing the talent gauge to max. Her low auto-attack rate, low strength stats, high cooldown for most of her offensive arts (all but one of which are physically based), and need to use Cool Off means that she'll typically be dealing out less damage than the rest of the characters. Instead, her strength is as a healer, possessing the greatest number, and most effective, healing arts of any character. Aside from her heals, she also possesses a couple of support arts that can enhance the party, such as raising tension or extending the duration of auras. Although she is not a dedicated fighter, she is the only character besides Reyn to have an initial Skill Tree that allows her to equip heavy armour.General stats  \u203b These stats are raw and do not include the bonuses from the skill lines.Arts Skill trees  Sharla has the following Skill Trees:Devotion  Devotion is one of Sharla's initial three skill trees, and the first skill is unlocked at the start of the game.

Some NPCsReyn  Reyn (Japanese: \u30e9\u30a4\u30f3, Rain, Rein; English dub: /\u02c8ra\u026an/) is one of the seven playable characters in Xenoblade Chronicles and one of Shulk's childhood friends. He is the second character introduced into the game after Shulk. Although he is a member of Colony 9's Defence Force, he can often be seen at Shulk and Fiora's side. Reyn is the stereotypical fun-loving boisterous joker of the group. He uses an oversize shield-gunlance, which can switch from shield mode into gun or lance mode. Riki implies that he snores but it is unknown if that is true or not. Reyn is always rolling his right arm in anticipation for action.Personality  Reyn serves as the muscle of the group in more ways than one. A true hero like him would know to have not just a strong body but to also have a strong heart. His one goal (and his one promise) in life was to protect his family and friends and everyone else he cares for, which is the main reason why he joined the Defense Force in the first place. He's not the smartest of the group and he serves as part of the team's comic relief along with Riki, but he knows when it's time to get serious. Reyn is also quite emotionally charged and has a habit of losing his temper, but it's usually when something grave is happening to his friends or other innocent beings. Examples would include when fighting enemies such as Metal Face or Egil. At various times, his friends need to help him simmer down when his aggressive feelings get the better of him. But at the end of the day, he never lets go of who he is. He seems to take pride in being himself, since he got annoyed when Sharla kept comparing him to Gadolt, going so far as to ask if she just saw him as a \"Gadolt substitute\". However, Reyn does have some feelings of doubt of his abilities at times, as he mentioned when he anguished on how ineffective he was when protecting others while Shulk wielded the power of the Monado. Despite his insecurities, Reyn disdained the thought of submission to unpleasant fates and values struggling against calamity, as he became notably aggressive towards Alvis for suggesting his efforts towards Zanza were fruitless. Reyn grew up with his childhood friends Shulk and Fiora. They were the first two he would always protect. He was also someone they would look for when they needed to smile and laugh. Additionally, he and Shulk always treated each other as brothers and they vowed to cover each other's backs. Dunban is a mentor to the duo, but Reyn knows that he has to grow up and use his own strength if he ever wants to get by in life. It is not heavily implied yet, but it is possible that Reyn has developed feelings for Sharla despite that she was Gadolt's fiancee. He even admitted once to Sharla that Gadolt seemed like tough competition for a guy like him, something to which she replied laughing. Additionally, Riki brought that up in a Heart to Heart with Reyn. The Heropon claimed Sharla to be the nice girl Reyn was looking for to start a family with. Reyn responded that they should finish saving the world and wait until Sharla had finished healing her heart before he could ask her, but he hoped she would not reject him if the time ever came.In battle  Reyn's main role in the game is that of a tank. With his crowd control, high aggro skills, the ability to wield heavy armour and defense increasing weapons, he keeps his allies protected by being a huge, bulky distraction. Reyn's high HP and his abilities, which include causing Paralysis, Strength Down, and Agility Down, allows him to further improve his survivability against enemy damage. He is also gifted with multiple Aura abilities that can turn him into an offensive powerhouse, defensive target, or prevent himself from getting incapacitated, and is one of the two party members (apart from Shulk) capable of Toppling and Dazing enemies quickly. This grants him excellent staying power and crowd control, which allows the other members of the party to rip into enemies without fear of retaliation. Reyn himself, however, does decent amounts of damage when combined with the rest of the party and is therefore a very useful party member in the beginning of the game. Although Dunban can somewhat play the role of aggro absorber once he joins the party in the middle of the game, his low health and risk of getting downed early despite his agility can be seen as a downside. Therefore, Reyn is still as viable mid-game due to his incredible tanking efficiency that allows him to keep aggro off his party members without fear of them (or him) getting hoarded due to his high health and defense. However, as he is the designated \"Tanking\" character, Reyn is reliant on healing to keep him on the front lines, often necessitating a healer to fight alongside him during tougher battles. Reyn also has a skill that increases AP gains from battles.General stats  \u203b These stats are raw and do not include the bonuses from the skill lines.Arts Skill trees  Reyn has the following Skill Trees:Spirit  Spirit is one of Reyn's initial three skill trees, and the first skill is unlocked at the start of the game.

The cost for each additional level follows a consistent pattern: For example, raising Shulk's Back Slash to level 2 costs 200 AP, while raising his Slit Edge to level 2 costs 220 AP. Raising these arts to level 3 costs 400 AP and 440 AP respectively (2x200 and 2x220), while raising them from level 5 to level 6 costs 2,400 AP and 2,640 AP respectively (12x200 and 12x220).Benefits  All physical and Ether attacking arts at level 1 have an additional hit rate of 5%. Each level increased will increase the hit rate further by 5%, up to a maximum of 25% at level 5 or higher. Furthermore, arts will have their effects enhanced by levelling up. These enhancements may include, but are not limited to: increased aggro added to enemies, increased damage, increased healing power, and increased buff or debuff duration, and reduced cooldown time.Art Books  Initially, arts cannot be raised beyond level 4. Intermediate books allow the art to be raised as high as level 7, and can be bought from shops. Advanced books allow the art to be raised to level 10, even if an intermediate book for that art has not yet been learned or obtained, and can be found in gold chests dropped by monsters above level 45, or in special chests found in certain locations. These sources are mutually exclusive; there are no Advanced books available for sale, nor are there any monsters that drop Intermediate books. After an art book is obtained, it is necessary to select it in the inventory and read it to unlock the additional levels of that art. Art books can only be read once, and cannot be used if the character has not yet learned the Art itself or is not in the party. Intermediate books cannot be used if an Advanced book has already been learned. Excess Art Books can be sold to shops. (Note: There are two separate Art Books for the two characters who learn Guard Shift. These books are not interchangeable.)Art Book Sources  Generally, the drop rates for advanced books are extremely low\u2014some have a drop rate of less than 1%. Higher level monsters tend to have higher drop rates. The save and reload method can be used to open the same gold chest repeatedly until a desired advanced book is obtained. Up to two of four named books can be acquired without duplicates (e.g. a given monster can drop up to two of either Back Slash, Battle Soul, Slit Edge or Light Heal).Dunban  Dunban (Japanese: \u30c0\u30f3\u30d0\u30f3, Danban; English dub: /\u02c8d\u028cnb\u00e6n/) is a Homs, and is one of the seven playable characters in Xenoblade Chronicles. Dunban serves as the voice of reason for the group, willing to kill a Homs in order to bring peace. Dunban owns a house in Colony 9 where he lives with his sister Fiora. Riki calls him \"Dundun\".Personality  Dunban is a soldier and a hero with a true heart. He is always willing to put his own life on the line to save everyone else. He is easily one of the most mature members of Shulk's party, if not the most mature, frequently reminding the others not to get cocky or careless and stay focused. He does at times let his boldness get to his head, but he tries to avoid being a coward and motivate his fellow comrades to do the same. As second-in-command and mentor/advisor of the team, Dunban is the voice of reason and speaks for everyone in some of the most dire times. Dunban is also unshakably determined, even more so than the rest of the party, continuing to wield the Monado even after it started to degrade his body and paralysed his right arm, though he was ultimately relieved when Shulk took it off his hands. In a Heart-to-Heart, Sharla expresses sympathy that Dunban losing the use of his right arm is his reward for stopping the Mechon assault on Bionis the year before. Dunban, however, states that he has no regrets, as he did what had to be done and they would never have repelled the Mechon without the Monado. Dunban almost never forgets that family and friends are important even in the battlefield. He serves as a mentor to Shulk and Reyn; but even though he has patience, he knows better than to be their babysitter and expects them to depend on their own strength. Like Shulk, he is very protective of his younger sister Fiora. As her older brother as well as the only biological family member she has close to him, her safety and well-being are his biggest concern. When he thought he lost her, he tried to stay strong and not let his emotions get the best of him; but he loses his temper after he finds out who \"murdered\" her. Fiora also says that Dunban is a big softy and cries when nobody is around but that he hates anyone knowing about it.Gameplay  Dunban has a variety of moves that allow him to deal a great amount of damage towards an enemy. In addition, many of his attacks combo together (and with status effects that a single party member usually cannot achieve), making his moves very effective. He also possesses many moves that draw aggro to him or increase his speed/evasion. His downside is his poor HP. Wearing heavy armour to increase Physical Defence does not fix this problem, as Dunban is more oriented toward evading attacks than taking damage. One of Dunban's greatest strengths is his ability to fight up-level; he has many options suited toward this. High Agility (which Serene Heart can boost further) allows him to deal consistent damage against opponents that non-ether fighters have almost no chance of hitting. With sufficient talent levels, this accuracy allows him to maintain debuffs from moves such as Worldly Slash against Unique Monsters with very little downtime. He will usually hold aggro from damage alone in these scenarios, making it important to emphasize evasion and healing from another party member.Story  A high-ranking soldier of Colony 9, Dunban was originally thought to be the only one capable of wielding the legendary Monado. He used the Monado to repel the invading Mechon forces at the Battle of Sword Valley, one year prior to the game's main story. During the battle, the Monado took a considerable toll on Dunban's health, causing his right arm to become almost completely paralysed and preventing him from wielding the Monado, as any further exposure to the weapon could kill him. Despite the damage, Dunban is still able to effectively wield a katana, albeit with his left hand. He joins the party permanently after Xord is defeated.General stats  \u203b These stats are raw and do not include the bonuses from the skill lines.Arts Monado Arts  During the Battle of Sword Valley and the second round of the story battle event at Central Plaza when the Mechon attack Colony 9, Dunban wields the Monado and can perform three arts:Skill trees  Dunban has the following Skill Trees:Bravery  Bravery is one of Dunban's initial three skill trees, and the first skill is unlocked at the start of the game.

Dunban is shown performing a Chain Attack with Shulk and Riki as Shulk's Final Smash. He also appears as a Trophy in both versions of the game. A Dunban costume is also available for Mii Fighters as downloadable content.Quotes Arts Battle Character yells Shulk Reyn Sharla Fiora Riki Melia Vision Warnings Riki  Riki (Japanese: \u30ea\u30ad; English dub: /\u02c8r\u026aki/) is one of the seven playable characters in Xenoblade Chronicles and a member of the mercantile Nopon race. Despite his appearance, he is actually 40 years old and six of his children can be found in Frontier Village. In the English version, Riki eventually reveals (during a side quest) that he has a total of 11 children. He begins accompanying Shulk and his party after the group reaches Frontier Village.Personality  Naturally talkative, Riki often goes on at length about how he is actually a legendary hero spoken of in Nopon prophecy. In truth, his position as a \"hero\" was only granted by Chief Dunga as a way to pay off the heavy debts that have arisen from his and his children's huge appetites. Apart from this, Riki has very little involvement within the story's major plot, instead contributing to most of the game's comic relief. Quotes within the game show that Riki acts very much like his appearance: he is highly energetic, positive about mostly everything, and often exclaims what he feels with gusto, similarly to an excited child. In battle, his enthusiasm helps to calm several party members like Melia and Sharla, while being a nuisance to others like Reyn. Due to his overconfidence of being the \"Heropon\", Riki is also prone to bouts of childish \"hero talk\", often describing events in a way that made it seem like he contributed much more than he actually did. In-battle quotes show this very well, as he exclaims several lines such as \"Heropon run from nothing!\" and \"Heropon is biggest, strongest!\", while also calling his party members \"sidekicks\" to give himself more of the limelight. Sometimes, he will even outright proclaim that an issue that's been solved was \"all thanks to the Heropon\". However, this is all taken lightly by Shulk's party. Despite all this, Riki does have a knowledgeable side. His first suggestion to Shulk's party was to find an area with lots of Ether Crystals in order to hunt down a Telethia that was terrorizing Makna Forest, as he knew Telethia were attracted to Ether. He also reads his friends better than what one might expect, as he made an excuse to rest during the party's trek on the Fallen Arm before admitting to Dunban his actual reason: he stopped only for Melia to rest, as she was hiding the fact that she was tired and would not admit it to anyone. Finally, he was able to relate to Dunban's bond towards Fiora due to him having a family himself, and managed to have a Nopon-to-Homs talk with Dunban regarding family matters, to Dunban's surprise.Story  The party is first introduced to Riki in a short, humorous scene. The characters are seemingly unimpressed with the compact hero and are unsure what to make of him. This does not improve upon learning that Riki expects them to find equipment for him, too. Riki informs the group that his reason for being the Heropon (chosen legendary warrior for the Nopon race; English dub: /\u02c8h\u026a\u0259ro\u02ccp\u0252n/) is that he owes \"lots of monies\" to the people of Frontier Village. However he does mention that they will forgive his debts should he successfully slay the \"Dinobeast\" that has been plaguing Makna Forest. When Reyn doubts if Riki will be of any help, he immediately suggests that they hunt the \"Dinobeast\", by finding a place where there are many Ether Crystals. Apparently the Telethia they are hunting prefers to nest where there are Ether Crystals. Upon finding the Telethia, Riki becomes quite angered with the way \"his Makna Forest\" has been damaged. Melia mentions that Telethia will absorb Ether from the surrounding environment. They engage the beast in battle. After the fight, Riki takes most of the credit back in Frontier Village for slaying the \"Dinobeast\", even though according to the rest of the group, he did not actually do very much.Gameplay  In gameplay, Riki could be described as a combination of Black Mage & Thief, thanks to his debuffs and party skills. While he lacks arts that deal high amounts of damage immediately (such as those possessed by Dunban and Reyn), he has an array of ether arts capable of inflicting status ailments onto enemies. As such, he does not inflict as much immediate damage compared to other party members, but excels at softening enemies by stacking status ailments to deal considerable amounts damage over time. Once he stacks up enough status effects, he can also use Say Sorry to remove them, which deals more damage if the enemy has more status ailments. Riki also brings beneficial party buffs to battle. While he can heal his teammates with You Can Do It, he also has several powerful auras such as Hero Time, which randomly boosts a single stat immensely while preventing the party's tension from dropping, while his Talent Art Yoink! lets him steal stats and items from enemies, eventually even EXP and AP too. Riki additionally has an array of gimmicky arts to fit with his personality: Roly-Poly may forcibly topple an enemy or bind them if it fails, Bedtime causes causes every enemy (and Riki himself) to fall asleep, Behave will paralyze and calm crazed enemies, and Happy Happy allows Riki to manually charge the Party Gauge when he is at high tension. Interestingly, Riki has the highest HP stat of any of the playable characters (even more than Reyn), and although he initially can only wear light armour his later skill tree Heroism allows him to equip heavy armour. He does, however, have one downfall: due to his height, he tends to swim rather than walk in water (even water shallow enough for the other party members to walk in), making him useless in water battles.General stats  \u203b These stats are raw and do not include the bonuses from the skill lines.Arts Skill trees  Riki has the following Skill Trees:Vivacity  Vivacity is one of Riki's initial three skill trees, and the first skill is unlocked at the start of the game.

The reasons of its existence and powers are the core of the story. It is said to be the weapon used by Bionis in its war with Mechonis.Characteristics  The Monado is a powerful energy blade that can manipulate the ether around it, and by doing so, change the material and immaterial shape of the world. One's ability to control the Monado depends on the strength of will of its user; most Homs who try to use the sword cannot control it. At the beginning of the game, the Monado cannot harm any of the people of Bionis. The Monado grants its elected wielder the power of foresight. It is said that this is possible because all of the ether in the world is calculable in its changes. This allows the user to see where every ether particle is, was, and will be. The Monado emits a particular ether wavelength in its ground state that attracts Telethia. Also, the Monado can be counteracted by opposing particles to that of the Monado. All of the seers must touch the Monado to receive their divination powers.Story Prior to Xenoblade Chronicles  14 years before the game, a group of Homs explorers left Colony 9 in search of the fabled sword. Their travels took them to Valak Mountain, where they disappeared. After them went Dickson, who found the bodies of the research team in the Sealed Tower, next to the Monado. He took the weapon along with the only survivor, who would grow up to be Shulk. One year before the events of the game, the first known Homs wielder of the Monado, Dunban, was able to exercise limited control of the sword and use it as a weapon against the Mechon at the Battle of Sword Valley. In doing so, he was able to thwart an attack against Colony 9. Due to sheer discipline and strength he could wield the blade, even though he could not fully control it. Dunban unwittingly sacrificed the use of his right arm for victory in the battle against the Mechon.Colony 9  Shulk dedicated his entire life to solving the secrets of the Monado and thus is not only able to wield the blade without problems, but also able to unlock its great power. Shulk experiences this great power for the first time when he sees the future while holding the Monado in his laboratory. However, he learns that he has no control over what he sees, so he does not know he was granted foresight at the beginning. When the Mechon attack Colony 9, during the second round of the story battle event at Central Plaza, Dunban joins Shulk and Reyn wielding the Monado. During the third story event battle, Dunban, not yet recovered from his injuries, tries to use again the Monado. When the Monado flies out of Dunban's hand, Shulk picks up the Monado. At this point, he gains the ability to predict the future, although not by choice. Thanks to the Monado's foresight, Shulk avoids getting killed. However, he is unable to damage Metal Face in any way with the Monado, which leaves him helpless against the Faced Mechon when he kills Fiora.Tephra Cave  Shulk and Reyn decide to avenge Fiora and set out for Colony 6. While in Tephra Cave, Shulk has a vision of the Arachno Queen killing Reyn. The prediction proves true when Shulk and Reyn fall into the Arachno Queen's Nest. Shulk unlocks another Monado ability, Monado Shield, allowing him to change the future that the Monado had predicted. After this event, Shulk is able to use the foresight in all battles, and subsequently able to use Monado Shield to defend against enemy arts. This prescience becomes a principal topic of the game.Makna Forest  While looking for ether crystals alone in Makna Forest, Shulk is attacked by strange monsters. When he tries to confront them, however, he is unable to face them, as they can read his thoughts. However, a Homs by the name of Alvis manages to control the Monado and unlock another of its powers. He explains that the Monado does not control its power, but its user does.Alcamoth  The party learns in Alcamoth, the High Entia capital, that the Monado was sealed away by the High Entia forefathers. When the party follows Sorean to Prison Island, they meet a giant by the name of Zanza, who was also locked away by the same forefathers. He claims to be the creator of the Monado, and offers to remove the shackles that prevent the Monado from harming beings of Bionis if he is released. Shulk agrees, and even though Zanza is apparently killed by Metal Face, the Monado is released, transforming into the Monado II, and Shulk can finally harm Faced Mechon. However, he can also hear the voice of Zanza through the blade for the first time.Galahad Fortress  The leader of Mechonis, Egil, uses the Apocrypha Generator located in the Central Factory from Galahad Fortress to revert the Monado to its inert state. Even after the battle ends, Shulk still cannot use the Monado. He finally forces it to awaken, but the use of the Monado is taxing to him. He learns from Meyneth in Agniratha that the Monado was used against Mechonis and the Machina by Zanza.Mechonis Core  When the party slays Yaldabaoth, Egil explains that Zanza inhabits beings of Bionis to live, and his soul dwells in the Monado. He tells the story of Arglas, and how Zanza used his body to wage war against Mechonis. After the battle, he was incarcerated in Prison Island and the Monado was sealed in Ose Tower, now called the Sealed Tower. After the story is told, Dickson appears and shoots Shulk with his rifle. Zanza leaves Shulk's body, revealing that the Monado is the weapon of destruction, the holder of Zanza's soul. After this revelation, Meyneth comes out from Fiora's body and uses her Monado (the symbol which appears on Fiora's chest) to battle Zanza. When Zanza defeats Meyneth, he takes Meyneth's Monado. With it, Zanza no longer needs to inhabit a living being to survive. However, Zanza did not realise that there was another Monado; Shulk's Monado.Alvis  When the party slays Zanza for the last time, a light connects the three Monados. After this, a voice is heard: Alvis, who says he is the Monado. He explains that Shulk is a god now because he has found his Monado, and that he can decide the fate of all the universe.In the Super Smash Bros.series  Shulk is a playable character in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS / Wii U and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. He uses the Monado (in its first form) in battle, and when it is activated in battle, Shulk's features and abilities change. The game adds two Monado Arts that are not in Xenoblade Chronicles; Jump (\u7fd4, lit. \"soar\"), which gives Shulk higher jumps, a higher-height Air Slash and lower defense, and Smash (\u6483, lit. \"attack/strike\"), which gives Shulk stronger knockback/launching power but at the cost of lower damage output and launching resistance.Arts  Shulk can activate the Monado's Arts by selecting the large icon in the center of the screen when it is fully charged. He then has access to the various Arts the Monado can perform. Each Art is unlocked at various points in the game, with only Buster and Enchant being available initially. In the beginning, the Monado arts can only reach level 4. After the events on Prison Island, all of the Arts can reach level 10. The following arts cannot be legitimately obtained, but are used by Zanza\u00a0and the Zanza Guardians\u00a0during the final battle:Xenoblade Chronicles 2 Arts  The Monado is a weapon in the Xenoblade Chronicles 2 DLC, able to perform various arts when used by a Driver.Notes Trivia Zanza  For related information of the final boss battle about this topic, see Zanza (boss). Zanza (Japanese: \u30b6\u30f3\u30b6; English dub: /\u02c8z\u00e6nz\u0259/), originally a human named Klaus (/\u02c8kla\u028as/) and referred to by his venerators as Lord Zanza, is a main character and the true antagonist in Xenoblade Chronicles. He existed before the creation of the game's universe. Long before the events of the game, Zanza possesses Arglas, a Giant from Bionis, who is subsequently confined by the High Entia on Prison Island. He reveals himself to be the creator of the Monado to Shulk and his party.\u00a0Appearance  Zanza's appearance changes throughout both his life and the game. Chronologically speaking, he first was a human scientist. When Bionis was created, he became the titan's immortal soul, causing his appearance to match that of the god. However, when he is first met at the top of Prison Island, Zanza is in possession of Arglas' body. After the death of Arglas, Zanza vanishes, only to reappear much later, having taken on his true form, which happens to greatly resemble Shulk. In this form, he gains wings and a revolving halo above his head. Near the end of the game, Zanza transforms into a version of Bionis, and it is in this form that he fights Shulk. After this, his top half becomes a Mechonis-styled torso and arms while his lower half becomes a Telethia-styled set of wings, representing the fact that he has combined both the powers of Mechonis and Bionis into one being. The glowing symbols move to the tips of the tail-wings.Story Prior to Xenoblade Chronicles  Zanza, originally called Klaus, was once a scientist working on a project attempting to create a new universe, hoping to help mankind reach divinity. His experiment succeeded in creating a new universe, and most of all life was sucked into this new universe, including half of Klaus' body, which came to be known as Zanza. Zanza and Meyneth, formerly known as Galea and Klaus' coworker, were the only beings to survive the destruction, and emerged from the endless sea of this new universe as Bionis and Mechonis, respectively. Many years before the start of Xenoblade Chronicles, Zanza began to fear the day when his creations would leave him, since it would mean his own demise; if they departed, he would not regain the ether from deceased denizens of Bionis. This, coupled with his growing loneliness and the fading of awareness of him among the denizens of Bionis, led Zanza to engineer a cycle of destruction and regeneration, in which all life must eventually be destroyed, returning to him to be recreated. Zanza possessed the body of the giant Arglas through the Monado and used it to lead an attack on the Mechonis. He was defeated, but managed to enlist the services of Dickson, Lorithia, and Alvis as his Trinity of Disciples.Present Day  Allowing his flesh - Arglas' body - to be held inside Prison Island and his soul inside the Monado, locked in Ose Tower, Zanza rested and recovered his strength. He was awakened when the Monado was discovered by an expedition of Homs from Colony 9. He sucked their lifeforces to replenish his own, and then possessed a young boy who was among the explorers. That boy was carried off to Colony 9 by Dickson and was raised as Shulk. Zanza then lay dormant within Shulk, waiting for the day when the Monado could be wielded by Shulk so that his flesh could be released. When Shulk's group arrives at Prison Island, the Mechon launch an attack. Zanza, in Arglas' body, makes a deal with Shulk: he will unlock the Monado's true strength if he is released from his shackles. Shulk eventually agrees and releases Zanza. However, just as Zanza appears to be back at full strength, Metal Face arrives with Face Nemesis and impales him with an Ether-destroying spear. Zanza enters a state of limbo for a very short time in which Nemesis attempts to communicate with him, but she is driven off by the party. Zanza's body is dead by this point, but his consciousness remains - he disperses into a cloud of ether, but continues to talk to Shulk as they fight the mechon. Alvis comes to the Island a little later and talks with Zanza, suggesting that he could have stood in Zanza's place for him. Zanza remarks that he feels a storm coming, and then seems to fade.Rebirth of Zanza  Although mentioned in passing more than once, Zanza does not reappear in person until the events at the Mechonis Core - when Shulk is shot in the back by Dickson, Zanza emerges from the boy's body, leaving Shulk unconscious. He reveals his motives for possessing Shulk, as well his desire to endlessly destroy and regenerate all life. He effortlessly defeats Egil and Yaldabaoth. He moves in to destroy the party, but Meyneth - inhabiting Fiora - unleashes her Monado and attacks Zanza. After a short fight, Zanza notices that Meyneth is not fighting at her full strength, and moves to attack Shulk, realizing he is important to her. When he tries to wipe out the party, Meyneth leaves Fiora's body and takes the full blunt of the attack, sacrificing herself for them. Zanza claims Meyneth's Monado and vanishes from the Core, teleporting to Prison Island. Here he causes it to sink inside the head of the Bionis, releasing copious amounts of ether and starting the process of turning the High Entia into Telethia. He uses the Bionis to attack the fleeing party, but Egil uses the Mechonis to defend them, and wounds the Bionis before he and the Mechonis are destroyed.Bionis Reawakens  After Bionis reawakens, Zanza is not seen by the party - he is in Memory Space, having visions and contemplating the immediate past and future. However, he is unable to see beyond a certain point, where his visions cut out abruptly. He does not understand this, as possessing both Monados means should make him \"one with the passage of fate\". His thoughts are interrupted with the realization that Dickson and Lorithia have been defeated, and he expresses confusion over this, asking, \"How can this be? Are Telethia growing weak?\"Final Battle  Once in space, the team meets Zanza in his second form, a cross between the Bionis and the Mechonis' bodies. He welcomes them, and thanks Shulk for his role in delivering the two Monados to him. Zanza offers Shulk the position of his new disciple, but Shulk turns him down. Zanza expresses regret that he must wipe out the Homs, as he had \"a desire for friendship\". He talks to them for a short while longer before attacking the party. They fight his first form, then his second form. His level is listed as\u00a0???, but it is speculated that this is around level 81. His creations are level 78 on the first fight and level 80 on the second. After defeating Zanza twice Shulk gains his own Monado, to Zanza's bewilderment, and attacks once more.Death  After this battle Alvis speaks to Zanza, informing him that even gods are restricted by providence. Zanza sees this as a betrayal and rebukes Alvis for disobeying him. Alvis is unfazed by this, and asks Shulk to make a decision: \"Does this world belong to Zanza? Or does it belong to you?\" The Monado III gains a new symbol (\u795e, kanji for god/deity), giving it the power to harm gods. Shulk rends Zanza in half, and the god is destroyed. Alvis, the physical manifestation of the Monado, asks Shulk what he desires to do with his newfound power. Shulk ultimately wishes for a world with no need for gods, honoring Meyneth's final wish. He tosses his Monado aside, ending the need for gods and Bionis itself. The world is recreated, transformed into a state similar to how it was originally, with continents instead of titans. It is unclear how similar this universe is supposed to be to the original, but Alvis' parting words indicate an optimistic future.Motives  Many question Zanza's motives, which, much like Dickson's, were never properly explained. When Zanza is first introduced, in his true form, it is clear that he wishes to destroy Bionis and recreate the universe in his own image \"...as he has done many times before.\" However, later down the line, it is revealed that this universe was created through some form of experiment, an experiment that destroyed his original universe and created the one of Bionis and Mechonis. Therefore, Zanza's original plans with his experiment and what he actually wanted in the end were two completely different things, and it is altogether possible and in fact likely that Zanza, with the above quote, was referring to the cycle of death and rebirth of the world he had put in place to maintain his existence. On another note, Alvis insists several times that all Zanza ever desired was friendship, though this idea is never fully explored.Quotes Video Valak Mountain  The Valak Mountain (Japanese: \u30f4\u30a1\u30e9\u30af\u96ea\u5c71, Varaku yukiyama, lit. Valac Snowy Mountain; English dub: /\u02c8v\u00e6l\u00e6k/) is located on Bionis' right arm in Xenoblade Chronicles. It is by far the largest location in the game by explorable area. Located at the bottom of Valak Mountain is a path that leads to Bionis' Thumb, which in turn leads to Sword Valley. At night the ice trees send a beam of light into the sky, illuminating the mountain with a yellow glow. The two strongest enemies in the game are located here, which are the Blizzard Belgazas\u00a0and the Avalanche Abaasy, and they appear only after defeating Egil, as the other Superbosses. It houses ruins of High Entia and Giant origin. It is said that Valak Mountain was not always this cold, but a movement of Bionis changed its climate. There are no permanent settlements in this zone, and its only inhabitants are a couple of Nopon explorer parties. Later in the game, a fleeing group of High Entia uses the\u00a0Sealed Tower\u00a0as a refuge after the events in the Mechonis Core.Story  The party, heading to Sword Valley, must pass though Valak Mountain. Upon reaching the area, they are told by Alvis to head towards the\u00a0Sealed Tower. Arriving at the entrance to the tower, they find that the door is covered by a thick layer of ice. The party must then obtain the Magma Rock from the Conflagrant Raxeal in the\u00a0Lava Cave in order to melt the ice and enter the tower. Once resting inside Sealed Tower, Alvis tells Shulk that he has to accept his vision, which Dunban overhears. After that, the party continues towards Bionis' Wrist via the Great Glacier, where they encounter Face Nemesis and engage Metal Face in battle, where he reveals himself as Mumkhar.Landmarks and Locations Landmarks  Upper Level Landmarks Lower Level LandmarksLocations  Upper Level Locations Lower Level LocationsMining Points of Interest Enemies Normal Minor Enemies Quest Exclusive Enemies Unique Monsters Quest Exclusive Unique Monsters Boss NPC Heart-to-Hearts Bionis' Leg Quests  This page lists all the quests available in Bionis' Leg.

It can be entered through the Bionis' Interior. The main village is the sole Nopon village on Bionis, Frontier Village. Valak Mountain can also be accessed through Makna Forest.Story  When Shulk and friends first arrive, there is a cutscene showing Melia fighting a Telethia and losing her personal guards. Meanwhile, the group notes that the heat is unbearable (due to being at the back of the Bionis) and decide to look for the nopon village. After traveling deeper into the forest, they find a young girl unconscious, and Shulk recognizes her from his visions. Upon closer inspection, Sharla notes that she is suffering from a lack of Ether. Shulk sets off to find some pure Ether Crystals, which in the game itself are found at the Lakeside Landmark. Eventually Shulk finds the Crystals and is met by a mysterious young man, who is able to wield the Monado without issue. The man mentions to Shulk that the Monado can be controlled and teaches Shulk how to use the Purge Ability to stop the Puera Telethia who attack. After a difficult battle, Shulk slays the Telethia, and is found by Reyn. The mysterious man from before disappears. After this, Melia is revived and the gang prepare to continue their quest; Melia advises they head for Frontier Village, the only settlement in this area.Landmarks, Locations, and Secret Areas Landmarks Locations Mining Enemies Normal Minor Enemies Quest Exclusive Enemy Unique Monsters Quest Exclusive Unique Monster Bosses Quest Exclusive Boss NPC Heart-to-Hearts Collectopaedia  See Makna Forest Collection.Quests  See Makna Forest QuestsTephra Cave  The Tephra Cave (Japanese: \u30c6\u30d5\u30e9\u6d1e\u7a9f, Tefura d\u014dkutsu; English dub: /\u02c8t\u025bfr\u0259/) is a large, cavernous area in Xenoblade Chronicles. The cave is located inside the Bionis' right leg spanning from the right calf to its kneecap. It must be navigated at least twice throughout the game, once to reach the Cylinder Hangar and once to reach Bionis' Leg. It is first reached via Tephra Cave Entrance at Colony 9. Tephra Cave is the first area where Ether Crystals can be mined.Story  This cave network is the main path from Colony 9 to Colony 6 and the rest of Bionis. A permanent squad of the Defence Force is within the complex. Another path links the cave with the Cylinder Hangar which rests above Colony 9. Reyn has been tasked with gathering Cylinders to operate a Mobile Artillery that has crashed into a house in the Residential District of Colony 9. The actual Cylinder Hangar appears to be part of a larger ship, which Shulk theorizes was made by Homs. After the Mechon assault on Colony 9, a previously sealed door has now been unsealed. Shulk and Reyn use this new path to reach Colony 6. While in the cave, they reach some dead travelers. They decide to allow them to \"return to the Bionis\", leaving the corpse in a body of water. After this, they decide to rest, while they comment on the lack of travelers on the caves. After Shulk wakes up, he catches up with Reyn, and they are attacked by a group of spiders, which take Reyn hostage. Shulk tries to catch up with him, scared because of a vision he saw with Reyn being killed by a big spider. After a long chase, he manages to catch up with Reyn just before he is killed by the spider. In an act of desperation, Shulk manages to unlock Monado Shield and saves Reyn. Together they manage to kill the beast and safely exit the caves, but not before theorizing that the spider was the reason why nobody from Colony 6 had reached Colony 9 for a while. After the events in Mechonis Core, a new area of Tephra Cave opens up, which contains enemies of level 90 and up. The new path can be found at Vilia Lake, where there were previously rocks blocking the path. The new area also contains a Giant ruin.Landmarks and Locations Landmarks  Landmarks GF Landmarks 1F Landmarks 2F Landmarks 3FLocations  Locations GF Locations 1F Locations 2FMining Enemies Normal Minor Enemies  Post Mechonis Core:Quest Exclusive Enemies  Post Mechonis Core:Story Exclusive Enemies Unique Monsters  Post Mechonis Core:Quest Exclusive Unique Monsters  Post Mechonis Core:Boss Heart-to-hearts Trivia ", "Danganronpa Wiki": "Danganronpa Wiki ", "Spyro Wiki": "Spyro Wiki Skylanders  The Skylanders are legendary heroes and champions in the world of Skylands, as well as the only playable characters in the Skylanders series. Their ancient mission is to protect Skylands, and its magical Core of Light, a great machine that repelled The Darkness, the ultimate force behind all evil. Using their magical powers and machinery, the Skylanders defended their world for generations, keeping peace and balance. The most powerful of all Skylanders are the Giants, who are also known as the Elder Elementals.Personality  Each Skylander has their own unique personality. They are freedom fighters in spirit, living for action and their love for battle. United by their unique abilties and loyalty to their leader, Master Eon, as well to each other, family, and friends, the Skylanders all share the purpose and destiny to protecting Skylands from all things evil.Abilities  Each Skylander wields a single element: Earth, Air, Fire, Water, Life, Undead, Magic, and Tech. In addition, each Skylander is weak against one certain element in the Battle Arena: Earth is weak against Air, which is weak against Fire,\u00a0which is weak against Water,\u00a0which is weak against Life,\u00a0which is weak against Undead,\u00a0which is weak against Magic,\u00a0which is weak against Tech,\u00a0which is weak against Earth.Story History  It was said that the Giants were the original Skylanders, and the first to exist. The Giants battled against the tyrannical Arkeyans for the freedom of Skylands. In a final battle against the Arkeyans, the Giants were shot to Earth as a form of sacrifice, where they\u2019ve been buried underground ever since. As the years passed, the enormous Skylanders were soon considered as a myth. Time went on, and many brave Skylanders helped protect Skylands from all things evil, and protecting the Core of Light from the forces of darkness.\u00a0Despite the fact that the Skylanders come from different realms and worlds, each know that it is their destiny to use their abilities to protect Skylands. The Skylanders have an unbreakable bond with their Portal Masters. Though they are not servants, the Skylanders chose to serve their Portal Master and do so eagerly.Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure  For generations, the Skylanders worked with the Portal Masters in keeping peace and balance in their world, battling the forces of darkness, and protecting the Core of Light. The Skylanders were previously led by the veteran Portal Master, Master Eon, who was their leader, until The Darkness returned one day. Seeing the incoming threat, Eon called upon six of the Skylanders to prepare for battle as the evil Portal Master, Kaos, returned from his exile to once again attempt to destroy the Core of Light and rule Skylands as its emperor. By Eon's command, the Skylanders fought valiantly against Kaos's dark forces, but as they were winning the struggle, Kaos released his Hydra, who successfully destoyed the Core of Light in a devastating blast. Shortly after the Core's destruction, all of the Skylanders were banished from Skylands to Earth, where they were turned into toys as a result of Earth bearing no magic, and waited for a new Portal Master to find them. Although Master Eon survived the destruction of the Core of Light, he became a spirit and was unable to fight Kaos and The Darkness, leaving the duty of leading the Skylanders to the new, young Portal Master. After Master Eon recruited the new Portal Master, the Skylanders made their suprising return to Skylands, arriving on the Shattered Island to save its Mabu inhabitants from a freak tornado that was ravaging their village. The heroes then began their quest to save Skylands from Kaos' tyranny with the new Portal Master guiding them. After Kaos's defeat in his lair, three of the Skylanders (Spyro, Gill Grunt, and Trigger Happy) returned to the Ruins with the captive Kaos, and Hugo later banished the evil Portal Master to Earth where he was shrunk and turned into a toy. However, Master Eon hinted to the new Portal Master that the journey with their Skylanders was only the beginning.List of Skylanders  There are many Skylanders who have caught Master Eon's attention and joined the cause to battle the dark forces who threaten the world of Skylands. The famous purple dragon himself even joined the ranks, becoming leader of the modern-day Skylanders.The Main Skylanders Magic Water Tech Fire Life Undead Earth Air Additional Skylanders Sidekicks Trivia Main Page Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure  Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure, formerly known by its test title as Spyro's Kingdom, is the first game of the Skylanders franchise, published by Activision, and developed by Toys for Bob for the Wii, Xbox 360, PS3, and PC.

But Skylands is in grave danger, and it needs the help of the new Portal Master. Afterwards, the new Portal Master and the Skylanders meet up with Hugo, Eon's assistant, and Flynn, the balloonist, on the Shattered Island and saved the villagers from a freak tornado ravaging their town, revealing the return of the Skylanders. As they make their way to the Ruins, Hugo explains to the new Portal Master how Skylands became its current state. The Portal Masters had protected Skylands for as long as anyone could remember. Master Eon, the last good Portal Master of Skylands, and his Skylanders guarded the Core of Light, a great machine that enriched Skylands and repelling The Darkness, the ultimate force behind all evil. However, Kaos, an evil Portal Master who attempted to destroy the Core of Light in the past, returned from his banishment in the Outlands to destroy the Core to rule Skylands as its emperor, knowing that Eon has grown weaker with age. The Skylanders fought against Kaos' minions to protect the Core of Light, and just as they were winning the battle, Kaos unleashed a mysterious creature that successfully destroyed the Core, causing the Skylanders to be banished from their world. As the Skylanders were drifted farther away from the magic of Skylands, they began to shrink until they reached Earth, where they were turned into toys as a result of that world having no magic and awaited for the new Portal Master to find them. Master Eon survived the destruction of the Core of Light, but became a spirit and couldn't fight the Darkness without his physical body. He then awaited for the arrival of a new Portal Master until one finally arrived: the young player. After saving Cali from a group of evil Drow, Hugo begins with tasking the Skylanders in recovering the missing Eternal Sources needed to rebuild the Core of Light. Kaos soon becomes aware of the new Portal Master and the Skylanders, attempting to stop them from retrieving the Eternal Sources, but fails. With the help of the new Portal Master, the Skylanders recover the missing Eternal Sources with the help of new allies, including a Gillman named Gurglefin, a newly grown Tree person named Arbo, and a sarcastic Undead skeleton, T-Bone. Eventually, the Core of Light is restored, repelling the Darkness from Skylands and driving Kaos back into the Outlands. Despite their victory, Hugo knew that the fight wasn't over, since Kaos still has the very weapon that he used to destroy Core of Light and knows that the tyrant will do the same again. The decision is made to take the battle to Kaos in his lair. Using the Core of Light, the Skylanders are transported to the Lair of Kaos where the enemies they faced before lurk before confronting Kaos himself face-to-face. During the battle, Kaos reveals his most powerful minion to aid him in the fight against the Skylanders, the very minion that destroyed the Core of Light and caused Eon to be in his current spirit state: the Hydra. The Skylanders successfully defeated Kaos, his dark minions, and the Hydra, and he was soon imprisoned inside a forcefield back at the Ruins. After a tender moment between Flynn and Cali, Kaos then vowed to Eon that he'll keep returning to Skylands until it was his if he was to be banished to the Outlands again, but Master Eon had a more fitting place in mind to banish Kaos to instead. Eon gave Hugo the honor to type in the coordinates to Kaos' destination of exile in the Core of Light, with Kaos attempting to bargain with Hugo to share Skylands if he was set free. Knowing Kaos and his evil ways, Hugo typed in the final coordinates, sending the evil tyrant skywards out of Skylands to Earth, where he is turned into a toy and is soon tormented by a dog. Master Eon appears before the new Portal Master, explaining that they may have seen the last of Kaos and the Darkness, but there was still much to do, and that their journey with their Skylanders is only just beginning.3DS Version  The young player is greeted by Master Eon, the last protector of the realm, and he quickly explains that Skylands need their help. The Radiant Isles was the tranquil home to the Mystic Seekers, until The Darkness arrived and brought in a fearsome invader from the Outlands: Hektore. Using the power of the Darkness, Hektore enslaved the Seekers and forced them to build the Dark Mirror, which Hektore uses to shroud the Radiant Isles from the rest of Skylands to keep the power of the Seekers for himself. Master Eon then gave the new Portal Master the main objective: lead the Skylanders to destroy the Dark Mirror and free the Radiant Isles. The young Portal Master is then teleported to an area where the leader of the Mystic Seekers, Fargus, and his son, Wendel, were awaiting for the new Portal Master's arrival, having escaped from Hektore. Before Fargus can start explaining on what to do next, evil laughter filled the air as Hektore has rediscovered Fargus and Wendel and was homing in on their location. In his haste, Fargus gave the new Portal Master the task of gathering Radiance Crystals, rebuilding the Shattering Sigil and destroy the Dark Mirror before he giving the title of the Last Free Seeker to Wendel. As Hektore arrived, Fargus sacrificed himself to protect Wendel and the new Portal Master from Hektore's wrath, being recaptured in the process. Shortly afterwards, both Wendel and the new Portal Master retreat to the Sanctuary, the only area in the Radiant Isles where Hektore can't reach. After gathering enough Radiance Crystals and saving the other Seekers, the Skylanders are able to confront Hektore himself at the Dark Mirror. After inflicting enough damage on the fiend, they make their way towards the Mirror while dodging Hektore's attacks and activated a beacon using Wendel's staff that allowed the Mystic Seekers to destroy the Dark Mirror. Hektore begins to threaten the Skylanders and the new Portal Master in retaliation, but he is destroyed shortly after the Dark Mirror's destruction. Wendel is reunited with Fargus, who then gives his son the status of a true Seeker. Wendel speaks to the new Portal Master that they will be forever be part of the Radiant Isles and that their home is safe to thanks to them and their Skylanders. Master Eon then appears before the new Portal Master, congrulating them on their victory and viewing them as a true protector of Skylands before concluding that the journey with their Skylanders is only just beginning.Realms 3DS Version Adventure Packs  Adventure Packs are additional levels for Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure that are purchased individually. They are packs that include the toy that unlocks the Adventure level, two magic items, and one Skylander.Adventure Pack Levels Skylanders: Universe  Skylanders: Universe was an online virtual world based on Skylanders. The developer's primary goal was to allow children to creatively express themselves and interact with other children within a safe environment. The online game was closed down on April 30, 2013 to make way for a \"new online experience\".Voice Talent Development  Toys for Bob was given the opportunity to revive a Vivendi franchise, and they chose the Spyro the Dragon franchise. It was mentioned by Toys for Bob that attempts to revive broad-audience mascot franchises haven't seen predictable success in the game industry. 'Just creating a new Spyro game after the traditional fashion was unlikely to work', says Paul Reiche. And reinventing the character as a \"really gritty, strange otherworldly Spyro\" didn't seem like a promising idea. Spyro needed a radical new idea. Reiche says he 'had considered integrating technology with toys and games for a while, and it was the kind of concept that was so outlandish that it was the most promising idea the team sketched out for the brand.' In 2007, after Vivendi merged with Activision, Toys for Bob began working on Skylanders. There were different early concepts for Spyro, including a \"realistic, gritty\" Spyro, a tiny Spyro that ran around the real world on book selves, and an origami Spyro that can take shape. However Activision wanted to do more with the character, so Toys for Bob kept coming up with imaginative ways to use the Spyro license, with toys being the way to do this. One of those ideas include playable little toy dragons that hatch from eggs for users to play with. Eventually, Spyro's Kingdom came into light. Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure was originally going to be a mature Spyro game that included blood, but the developers of Toys for Bob lost their enthusiasm and felt that this direction didn't feel like 'Spyro', before saying that making a dark game isn't what their passion was about. They spent six months on a variety of different directions with Spyro, and with the time and budget given by Activision, Toys for Bob eventually came upon the idea of Skylanders. Toys R Us has partnered with Activision and will help launch Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure this fall with a number of unnamed exclusives. The game and toys were developed by Toys for Bob. The game's main story was penned by Alek Sokolow and Joel Cohen who both worked on Pixar's original Toy Story film. This game was also originally revealed to be exclusive for the Wii, but when this game was revealed on February, it was announced that this game will be also be released for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, iPhone, iPad, the web, and even Microsoft Windows.Controversy  After the reveal announcement of Skylanders, it had received a large amount of negative criticism from the majority of the older Spyro fanbase; much of which continues to this day. Common complaints include Spyro's different character design, the game's younger target audience (compared to The Legend of Spyro), the absence of popular characters from the Original series and The Legend of Spyro series (such as Hunter, Ignitus, etc.), the concept of using toys in order to play the game, and for being another continuity reboot. The negative criticism on Spyro's Adventure also involved some fans claiming that Skylanders would \"fail\" upon its public release based on what they strongly dislike about the game when it was still in development. Several fans had also been sending hate mail and even death threats to both Activision and Toys for Bob in the hopes of trying to get them to cancel Skylanders, but both gaming companies have ignored the demands of the fans and were more focused on Skylanders' younger target audience. The executive producer of Skylanders, Jeff Poffenbarger, noted that he was aware of the negative reaction of the game from long-time Spyro fans and hard-core gamers. He acknowledged the issue that the negativity is not the demographic as they are aiming to take Spyro and introduce him to kids, the new target audience who have no idea who Spyro is. According to the Sterne Agee analyst, Arvind Bathia, Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure tested apparently very well with kids, who are the game's target audience.Reception  The game has received generally favorable reviews. Nintendo World Report gave both the Wii and 3DS version of Skylanders a 9 out of 10, praising the Wii version for fun gameplay, great production values and its perfection for young gamers, and the 3DS version for Unique and visually appealing characters, great for younger gamers, and well-designed 3D platformer. Gaming Nexus gave Skylanders a B+ and praised the game for taking the Spyro franchise to a younger audience, though noted that the game has a few flaws. Sometime afterwards, some of the negative Spyro fanbase became outraged when Gaming Nexus gave a positive review of Skylanders instead of a negative review that they were expecting Skylanders would receive based on only what they dislike about the game before its release. Destructoid praised the game with a 8 out of 10 saying, \"It's not the most complex game on the market, but the innovative gadgetry and authentic thoughtfulness on the part of the developer stands out in a market so used to churning out the same old crap.\" GameSpot has reviewed the Xbox 360 version of the game and it was rewarded with a 7.5 out of 10 for its good concept that has been well executed with its family-friendly innovative gameplay, RPG-style progression and tie-in toys with brains that work really well along with the Downloadable content for the Adventure Pack Toys as well. But however, they criticized the game for it's easy difficulty, confusing multiplayer and that can only be offline, Costly to complete everything, The portal peripheral being emperamental at times, and the risk of losing the figures can be a bane. Game Informer has given both the PS3 and the Xbox 360 versions of the game a 8.0 out of 10.0. IGN gave Skylanders an 8.0 out of 10, saying that \"Activision took a fun, but not particularly noteworthy game and made it a unique, flashy product\" and Skylanders is \"A fun, family action game in the vein of LEGO titles.\"Trivia External links Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure Characters  List of Characters in Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure.Cynder (Skylanders)  Cynder (\u30b7\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u00a0Cinder\u00a0in Japanese) is a violet dragon who is one of the playable Skylanders in the Skylanders series, first appearing in Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure. Her Series 3 counterpart is called Phantom Cynder. As an egg, Cynder was stolen from her mother and corrupted by the Undead Dragon King\u00a0Malefor, who gifted her with sinister abilities powered by the Undead element. She used these unnatural powers to terrorize Skylands until she was bested by Spyro. Freed from the influence of evil, Cynder joined the Skylanders to make amends for her past by using her Undead powers for good.Character Development  During the development of the Skylanders universe, it was important for Toys For Bob to establish a brand new universe that could introduce a league of new heroes, but to also honor the history of Spyro and Cynder. The end of The Legend of Spyro series left both Spyro and Cynder in a place that was open to interpretation and purposely left mysterious. This allowed the team the freedom to reintroduce these characters in a way that was very fitting for the world of Skylands \u2013 while also leaving it to longtime Spyro the Dragon fans to use their own imaginations to fill in the blanks. Spyro's world has always been a world full of imagination \u2013 and ultimately the developers decided that IMAGINATION was the most important aspect to carry forward into Skylanders. For many fans, Skylanders represents a fresh start for both Spyro and Cynder. But there are enough nods to previous games to allow longtime fans the freedom to imagine their own connections with the past. From Paul Reiche III's own perspective, Cynder was an opportunity to show an inverted image of Spyro \u2013 different gender, different original 'alignment' and very different approach to solving problems. While Spyro is a natural hero upon whom fortune has smiled most of his life, Cynder comes from a more troubled origin and has had to earn every ounce of her heroism the hard way. This contrast not only gives greater breadth to the role of dragons in our universe, but it also makes the friendship between Spyro and Cynder more interesting. When Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure was in development, Alex Ness, former Toys For Bob producer and chief-of-staff, revealed that the villain Vathek was originally planned to be the Undead dragon Skylander of the game, but the role was already taken by Cynder.Background Personality  Stolen as an egg, Cynder was brainwashed and trained in the ways of evil and darkness. She was a sinister dragon; a harbringer of despair and misery taught to strike fear into the hearts of Malefor's subjects and spread terror far and wide. However a speck of goodness burned somewhere in her black heart, which made her internally aware of the malicious actions she was committing unwillingly. After being freed from Malefor's spell, Cynder desires to make amends by battling evildoers with her dark powers, but she still struggles with her past. As a result of being corrupted under the Undead element, Cynder retains a wicked side and can occasionally be menacing, but she is trying hard to control her dark impulses from time to time. This omnious trait causes most of the Skylanders to try and keep a safe distance from Cynder just in case her inner darkness takes over. While she is loyal to the Skylanders, she is snarky, spiky when riled, witty, fierce and can be a terrifying force for good in the battle against the Darkness.\u00a0Cynder also possesses a liking towards dark and brooding places, a trait shared by all Undead Skylanders. However she doesn't enjoy pranks or jokes of any kind.Biography  While just an egg, Cynder was stolen by the henchmen of an evil dragon named Malefor and raised to do his bidding. For years, she spread fear throughout the land until she was defeated by Spyro the Dragon and freed from the grip of Malefor. But dark powers still flow through her, and despite her desire to make amends for her past, most Skylanders try to keep a safe distance...just in case.Story History  Before being recruited by Master Eon into the ranks of the Skylanders, Cynder was feared in almost every corner of the world of Skylands. Kidnapped as an egg by the Undead Dragon King, Malefor, Cynder was raised to serve the forces of evil. As she grew, the dark power of the Undead granted her incredible abilities, which she used to terrorize innocent people. Whole villages fell beneath her mystical lightning attacks, and even the bravest warriors would turn and flee when they saw her swooping down from the clouds with her talons outstretched. Twisted and corrupted by evil, Cynder was Malefor's black-hearted harbringer of misery and despair. But Spyro believed there was good in her, deep down. When he confronted her, a ferocious battle ensued. Despite Cynder's dark powers, Spyro was able to defeat her. When he did, Malefor's control over her was broken. No longer was she the puppet of the Undead Dragon King, and she was determined to make amends for all the suffering she had caused while under his control. Realizing how much she had changed, Master Eon recruited her into the Skylanders. Although she now fights for good, she still struggles with her dark side from time to time, and most of her fellow Skylanders try to keep out of her way - just in case her inner darkness takes over once more.Skylanders: Spyro versus The Mega Monsters  Cynder was mentioned by Jet-Vac as\u00a0one of the two Skylanders (the other being Hex)\u00a0who was assigned by Master Eon to investigate a mega-sized cockroach that was terrorizing Lucky Lagoon. However Kaos, who had claimed to be turning over a new leaf by battling evildoers, dealt with the problem long before the two Undead Skylanders arrived on the scene.Skylanders: Cynder Confronts the Weather Wizard  Cynder and Zook were relaxing in the sunrays at the Cloudless Desert, but the dragon felt that they were wasting time when they should looking for the next fragment to the Mask of Power. Soon, Hex arrived via portal to inform Cynder and Zook that Master Eon has requested their presence, but were forced into action when a freak rainstorm caused the sand dunes of the desert to start pulling the surrounding Mabu beachgoers underground like quicksand. After saving the inhabitants, the trio of Skylanders return to Eon's citadel where they learned that there have been numerous unusual weather strikes on numerous parts of Skylands. Master Eon then assigned Cynder, Zook, and Hex to venture to the Isle of the Dead, where they believe they'll find the cause of the storms, the Undead fragment to the Mask of Power,\u00a0and answer the call for help by the undead inhabitants.  After being attacked by a Gargantula and a swarm of Spiderlings, the Skylanders were saved by a ghoul named Flunky and his pet\u00a0Stump Demon, Dogwood.\u00a0They were escorted to Ghost Town where they learn from the Night Mayor, Morbo, of the unusual sunny weather conditions surrounding the area. The source of the weather is caused by a powerful wizard named Hurrikazam, who suddenly arrived in town and demanded tributes in the form the villagers giving Batterson's pies to him all the while whisking away the villagers offering the pies. In spite of Cynder trying to rescue the undead villagers, Hurrikazam retreated, promising that if the inhabitants don't tend to his demands for pies and if Skylanders angered him further, the weather wizard would bring endless sunshine which would destroy the undead crops. Morbo soon revealed what happened to the villagers Hurrikazam had taken along with the pies: they have been turned back into living, breathing creatures, the opposite of undead. Wondering how Hurrikazam possessed such a power to bring the undead back to life, the Skylanders allowed themselves to be taken by Morbo's Gargantulas to the weather wizard's Cloud Citadel, where they fought against Brock and his group of Drow\u00a0upon being discovered. The Skylanders soon realized that Hurrikazam is innocent and was forcefully doing his evil deeds by none other than Kaos. The evil Portal Master gloated that he was draining the undead villagers of their undeadliness to store it up in a tank of Undead energy to shower every island of Skylands with undead rain to turn the living into undead and destroy the other element.  When Hurrikazam refused to drain the Skylanders of their element, Kaos clipped the wizard's precious flower for defying him and tried to proceed with the draining process anyway, but inadvertanty released the Skylanders from their hold. Just as the Skylanders had Kaos cornered, Hex suddenly trapped Cynder and Zook in her bone fortresses. The elf sorceress revealed that she has switched sides, now serving Kaos but was concerned if the Undead Energy Extractor was still functional. When it still was, Hex allowed herself to provide Kaos with her powerful Undead energy, claiming that she was tired of being feared and longed to be normal again. Kaos eagerly began the procedure, however the machine was overloading due to the massive amount of Hex's power, which the elf sorceress had planned all along and never actually defected to Kaos. The machine soon exploded, and after a brief moment of seeing Hex's true form, the Skylanders return their attention to Kaos. While Cynder was busy repelling the evil Portal Master's pottery spells, she tricked Kaos into going near a soon-to-be revived Dogwood, who seized Kaos and Glumshanks upon being revived. With Kaos driven away, the Skylanders celebrated their victory back in Ghost Town, where the undead returned to their normal states and Hurrikazam apologized for his actions and announced to redeem himself by bringing storm clouds suitable for the Undead. As a token of his gratitude, the weather wizard handed Cynder an Amazing, Fantastic, Incredible, Suprising, Unfathomable, All-Coloured Rose seed, the Undead segment to the Mask of Power.\u00a0 Upon returning to the Eternal Archive, Cynder, Zook and Hex were given the horrible news by Spyro that Squirmgrub\u00a0had kidnapped Master Eon and took five of the pieces to the Mask of Power with him.Skylanders: Trigger Happy Targets the Evil Kaos  Cynder was one of the Skylanders who assembled to stop Kaos from reforming the Mask of Power. Despite getting through Kaos's defenses in his castle, the Skylanders were unable to stop Kaos from putting on the Mask of Power, which allowed him to steal the powers of the Skylanders, including Cynder's, rendering them defenseless. Cynder and the other Skylanders were teleported back to Eon's Citadel by Master Eon before they can be finished off. Without her ghost powers, she worked with the Skylanders in creating a makeshift tower to protect the Core of Light from Kaos. Despite their efforts, Kaos once again overwhelmed the heroes by using their powers against them. Trigger Happy, along with Cynder and the other Skylanders, tricked Kaos into using all of their powers at the same time, causing him to lose control. At that moment of weakness, the Mask of Power was yanked off Kaos's face by Trigger Happy, allowing the Skylanders to recover their abilities and use them to fully destroy the Mask of Power once and for all.Skylanders: Return of the Dragon King  Cynder was putting on a exhibition show at the Rumbletown Arena by taking on many challengers, including\u00a0Enfuego Chompies and a Crystal Golem. After the battle, the dragon goes to meet and greet her eager fans, one of them being the sprite, Calliope. The two shook hands, and while Cynder suddenly felt weak, the sensation went away almost instantly. As she and Calliope parted ways, Cynder was unaware that the sprite had unwillingly stolen an essence from her under orders of a returning enemy.  After feeling weak from shaking hands with Calliope, Cynder began tracking down the fairy with a charm she bought from Auric. However while following the trail at the Cadaverous Crypts, she lost the charm during a battle with a group of Rotting Robbies\u00a0and Bone Chompies, who weren't affected by her weakened Spectral Lightning attacks and pursued Cynder. Luckily, Cynder was saved by Wallop, Hex and Spyro, who had also been following the trail of Calliope. Realizing that she, Hex and Spyro were the only ones targeted by the fairy, Cynder joined her fellow Skylanders to the caves and followed Calliope to its depths. While navigating through the tunnels, Cynder noted that she had a feeling she had been there before. She and the other Skylanders soon spotted Calliope and quickly gave chase. Unfortunately, they arrived too late to stop Calliope from releasing their powers to a hidden shadow who absorbed the magic and became revived. Upon discovering the mastermind behind Calliope's actions, Cynder, Hex, Spyro, and Wallop were then easily overwhelmed by the renewed fire power of the Undead Dragon King Malefor. Upon awakening, Cynder found herself imprisoned in the Crypts along with Spyro, Hex and Wallop. She expressed animosity towards Calliope for allowing Malefor to return at full strength and insisted that the fairy must pay for what she had done. When it was revealed that Malefor was going after the Skylanders Academy to make her, Spyro and Hex suffer for the trouble they caused him, Cynder struggled in vain to get free to stop Malefor. In a fit of fustration, she lashed out at Spyro then Calliope before the purple dragon stopped her remarks. With some encouragement from Spyro, Cynder shared her experiences as Malefor's minion and how Spyro and Master Eon gave her a second chance despite her previous actions. She, along with the group, tried to convince Calliope that she could make up for what she had done. However, the fairy ran away, ashamed of what she had done and refused their help, leaving Flynn and Mags to find the Skylanders and rescue them. They immediately set off to stop Malefor, arriving at the demolished Skylanders Academy in time to challenge the evil dragon to a fight.  With Spyro, Hex and Wallop by her side, Cynder began distracting Malefor in order to lead him away from the school and its students. They used Mags to trap Malefor using chewing gum and redirected the Dread-Yacht into crashing into the evil dragon. However the collision only slightly damaged his armor, further angering Malefor who directs his fury to Spyro, angrily swearing that the young dragon would fall no matter how many times Spyro had stopped the evil dragon. This confused the four Skylanders as Hex was the who defeated Malefor. Unable to do any further damage, they were starting to lose the fight again until Calliope and Persephone intervened, and directed Spyro to attack Malefor's chestplate to reveal the crystal he used to drain the Skylanders' powers. To destroy the chestplate, Hex used a spell on Spyro that would redirect his speed into a stronger impact with an orb. Cynder assisted Spyro by increasing his speed fast enough to smash Malefor's chestplate. Once it was out of the way, Spyro destroyed the crystal inside and released the powers of all defeated Skylanders. As Cynder spoke true about Malefor's persistent nature, the Undead Dragon King attempted to keep attacking despite now facing against a large number of rejuvenated Skylanders. At full power, the Skylanders quickly tied Malefor's tail to the Dread-Yacht's anchor and Malefor was dragged towards the endless abyss when Wallop knocked the Dread-Yacht over the island's edge. Despite his pleas of help to Calliope, she and the others only watched as Malefor fell to the lower parts of Skylands. The fairy regretted having started the trouble to begin with, but Master Eon assured that the Academy would be rebuilt and the Skylanders and their allies would help her regardless.Skylanders: Imaginators  Cynder first appeared in the Dragon Temple with a non-speaking role, helping the other dragons to undo Brain's mind control over Skylands. She later appeared in the Cursed Tiki Temple as the chapter's Storyteller, assisting the player in restoring the stolen Skull Tiki to his rightful place in the temple.Relationships Spyro the Dragon  When Spyro defeated Cynder, he gave her a second chance despite what she had done in the past, and they have been friends ever since. It is mentioned that after a dangerous quest with Spyro, Cynder came out smiling, presumably for the first time.Wrecking Ball  While most Skylanders try to keep a distance from Cynder to be on the safe side, Wrecking Ball once thought it would be funny to trip up Cynder with his long tongue. However Cynder didn't find that funny, and she zapped Wrecking Ball's tongue with her Spectral Lightning, leaving the grub worm to not eat properly for a fortnight. It is unknown if Cynder still holds some animosity towards Wrecking Ball after that.Hex  Cynder sympathizes with Hex as she too knew what it was like to be feared.Zook  The dragon is sometimes irritated by Zook's laidback personality but tolerates him.Calliope  At first, Cynder was happy to meet Calliope, who was another fan of hers. When Cynder discovered that the fairy was responsible for stealing her powers and allowing Malefor to return, the dragon was hostile towards Calliope, proclaiming that the fairy must face the consequences for her actions. Spyro soon reminded Cynder that the one to blame for their predicament is Malefor, and Cynder apologized to Calliope for her behavior.Malefor  Cynder expresses animosity towards Malefor as he was the cause of her dark past. She is fully aware what the evil dragon is capable of and was willing to try and stop Malefor from harming everyone she cares about.Abilities  Due to her exposure to the darkness of Malefor's corruption, Cynder gained powers of the Undead element, such as breathing dark electricity and temporarily turning into a shadowy apparition to dash past enemies, leaving behind a trail of ghostly allies that can attack opponents. Being a dragon, Cynder has the ability to fly using her wings. Her Series 2 Wow Pow allows her to summon a spectral thunderbolt from above, and her Series 3 Wow Pow allows her to transform into a giant exploding skull. Choosing the Nether Wielder path improves the power of Cynder's Spectral Lightning attack. This includes an increased range and duration of usage, as well as being able to cause any ghosts created by the Shadow Dash attack to explode when hit by Spectral Lightning. This upgrade path is best suited to a more aggressive style, allowing Cynder to deal damage to enemies repeatedly and also take out swarms of smaller enemies - like Chompies - with ease. This upgrade path is well suited to Series 2 Cynder with the Lightning Rain Wow Pow. Choosing the Shadowdancer path improves the power of Cynder's Shadow Dash and ghost attacks. This includes longer lasting ghosts with greater attack range and being able to damage enemies with the Shadow Dash when she dashes through them. The ghosts can also be upgraded to slow enemies down when they attack. This upgrade path is best suited to crippling enemies and then pouncing on them, by charging through enemies and slowing them down in the process. This upgrade path is well suited to Phantom Cynder with the Skull-Splosion! Wow Pow.Console Stats  These are the starting and maximum statistics for this Skylander in the console version of the games.Power Stats  Warning: These stats are not used in any of the Skylander games.

He also has a Dark, and a Legendary counterpart, who are available in the 3DS Starter of Spyro's Adventure and in the Toys R Us Legendary Pack with Legendary Chop Chop and Legendary Bash respectively. Spyro has a Series 3 counterpart called Mega Ram Spyro. After committing countless heroic deeds and adventures in his world, Spyro was invited by the great Portal Master, Eon, to become a Skylander. The young dragon accepted the offer and agreed to fight for Skylands, a world that holds the potential ability to jump to any point of the universe through portals.\u00a0Impulsive and headstrong, he struggled to work in a team at first with his fellow Skylanders, but as time passed, Spyro became one of Master Eon's strongest leaders in the fight against evil. He is good friends with two fellow Skylanders,\u00a0Gill Grunt and Trigger Happy.Character Development  While looking for new ideas for the Spyro the Dragon license in 2007, Activision and Toys for Bob explored many concepts with Spyro, including a \"realistic, gritty Spyro\", a \"tiny Spyro\", and an \"Origami Spyro\". Eventually the toys-to-life idea of Spyro's Kingdom came into light. When the original concept of Spyro's Kingdom was still underway, Toys for Bob originally had a dragon character named Fire Dragon, who was one of the playable heroes. \"Spyro was going to be a full-grown dragon and the king of Spyro's Kingdom. You'd go to him for quests, and he\u2019d tell you where to go and help you on your adventures.\" While His Purple Majesty was originally going to be a benevolent and regal NPC, \"it was felt that they couldn\u2019t have a game called Spyro\u2019s Kingdom without Spyro as a playable character, so Fire Dragon became Spyro.\" During the development of the Skylanders universe, it was important for Toys For Bob to establish a brand new universe that could introduce a league of new heroes, but to also honor the history of Spyro and Cynder. The end of The Legend of Spyro series left both Spyro and Cynder in a place that was open to interpretation and purposely left mysterious. This allowed the team the freedom to reintroduce these characters in a way that was very fitting for the world of Skylands \u2013 while also leaving it to longtime Spyro the Dragon fans to use their own imaginations to fill in the blanks. Spyro's world has always been a world full of imagination \u2013 and ultimately the developers decided that IMAGINATION was the most important aspect to carry forward into Skylanders. For many fans, Skylanders represents a fresh start for both Spyro and Cynder. But there are enough nods to previous games to allow longtime fans the freedom to imagine their own connections with the past.Background Personality  Although eager and young at heart, Spyro is a strong-willed dragon who is fearless and brave; a born hero dedicated to defending his world from all things evil. He holds a photographic memory, which gifts him encyclopedic knowledge of all the islands and creatures in Skylands he encountered, more so than any other Skylander. He is always up for adventure (his favorite kind being treasure hunts), and is the first Skylander to leap into action. Spyro is a usual quick learner, his brilliant mind allowing him to be able to master new abilities in a matter of hours.\u00a0Because of this unique trait, he is convinced that he can be good at everything so he can put his new powers to good use to help defend Skylands. However Spyro isn't accustomed to not learning new abilities right away despite being trained by Master Eon. A prominent example of this is shown in Spyro versus The Mega Monsters, when he failed to master the Daybringer Flame in a training session with his fellow Skylanders, Spyro felt greatly discouraged. Although he is well in the company of his companions, Spyro possesses a headstrong and impulsive side. In The Machine of Doom, it was revealed that he believed that he could do everything by himself, implying that Spyro was used to doing heroics on his own prior to becoming a Skylander. This caused him to struggle in working in a team at first, and his fellow Skylanders always remind Spyro that he doesn't have to do everything alone. This trait has seemingly diminished during the course of being a Skylander when Spyro gradually became more humble, as shown in Spyro versus The Mega Monsters\u00a0when he shared his victory over Kaos with the other Skylanders who helped him. He always keeps his temper in check, but there are times when he allows his emotions to get the better of him. After many adventures with the Skylanders, Spyro grew into a natural leader dedicated to scorching the forces of darkness. He takes his role as a Skylander seriously after being taught by Master Eon and holds deep insight regarding his fellow Skylanders, seeing them as more than just a team, but family, making them an unstoppable force against the toughest of foes. According to Roller Brawl, Spyro's leadership is on par with a roller derby's pivot, \"establishing the team's strategy and sets the pace of the pack\". In Skylanders: Imaginators, Spyro is still somewhat cocky and occasionally cracks a joke or two, much to the dismay of certain Skylanders. According to him, he is awesome, but a Skylander who does pretty good in handling Doomlanders is pretty cool in his book.Biography  Spyro hails from a rare line of magical purple dragons that come from a faraway land few have ever traveled. It's been said that the Scrolls of the Ancients mention Spyro prominently\u2014the old Portal Masters having chronicled his many exciting adventures and heroic deeds. Finally, it was Master Eon himself who reached out and invited him to join the Skylanders. Now calling Skylands his home, Spyro remains one of its most valued protectors, with evil facing a new enemy\u2014and the Skylanders gaining a valued ally.Story History  Spyro is the great, stout-hearted hero of legend, not to mention the number one defender of Skylands. Hailing from a rare race of magic purple dragons, Spyro was born in a land far away from Skylands' furthest frontiers. From a young age, Spyro became a battler for good; a warrior against evil and protector of the peace. His fearless exploits and heroic adventures were even recorded in the Scrolls of the Ancients (and those Ancients didn't keep a record of just any old thing). One of the many Portal Masters who watched Spyro's success with acclaim and applause was the bearded legend himself, Master Eon. It was Eon who transported Spyro through the Portal of Power to his citadel at the Core of Light. Here, Spyro met the Skylanders squad and swiftly agreed to join them in battling all things nasty. During his time as one of the Skylanders, Spyro defeated the evil dragon Cynder when she was spreading fear throughout Skylands for many years, freeing her from the sinister thrall of the Undead Dragon King, Malefor. After Cynder vowed to fight for good, she and Spyro went on a dangerous quest in which the Undead dragoness came out smiling. Afterwards, Spyro convinced Master Eon to sign Cynder up as one of the Skylanders. Spyro was also the one who inspired Lightning Rod to become a Skylander after telling the storm giant his stories of faraway places and dangerous adventures. There was an incident with Spyro when The Darkness attempted to corrupt the Core of Light. Spyro nearly suffered a terrible fate when he was almost consumed by the dark magic, but he was saved by Master Eon. Under the old Portal Master's teachings, Spyro learned how to fully harness this dark power, becoming his sinister alter-ego: Dark Spyro. Combined with his brave heart and careful control, Spyro was able to use this dark power to fight the forces of evil without losing himself to the darkness. When a group of Skylanders absorbed Petrified Darkness and became darker versions of themselves after a battle against Kaos, it was Spyro who helped them tame that darkness to use it against evil, as he had learned to control that evil power long ago.\u00a0Skylanders: The Machine of Doom  Spyro, Gill Grunt, Eruptor and Boomer were on Eon's Island with the other Skylanders listening to Gill Grunt's special concert, much to their discomfort. Shortly afterwards, Flynn and Hugo crash-landed in their hot air balloon nearby, with Spyro having to save Boomer from where the balloon was going to crash due to the troll having put dynamite in his ears to mute out Gill Grunt's singing. Hugo informed the Skylanders and Master Eon urgent news of flying sheep attacking the Mabu Market, though the Skylanders didn't believe it at first until they saw an image from Eon's portal of the market being attacked. Master Eon tasked Spyro, Gill Grunt, and Eruptor to go to the Mabu Market to find out what was going on. After reaching the Market, Spyro, Gill Grunt, and Eruptor found out that the sheep weren't really flying, but were being carried by invisible trolls who were led by a Spell Punk. While the other Skylanders fought the trolls, Spyro went after the Spell Punk nearby and pinned him down, forcing the wizard to reveal that he and the trolls were testing out an invisibility spell, but the trolls wanted to cause mayhem, therefore drawing attention to themselves. The Spell Punk then accidentally blurted out they were looking for an item called the Chattering Key for Kaos. Appearing as a frightening projection of his head, Kaos scolded the Spell Punk, and transported the wizard and the remaining trolls back to his lair. Spyro confronted the floating head of Kaos and demanded to know why he was after the Chattering Key, \u00a0but the evil Portal Master refused to answer the young dragon before disappearing. Back on Eon's Island, Spyro learned from Hugo that the Arkeyans created the Chattering Key as an artifact used to opening a tomb that contained an ancient Arkeyan weapon. Knowing that Kaos would go after such a weapon that is capable of destroying the Core of Light, Spyro, Gill Grunt, Boomer, and Eruptor decided to get the Key before Kaos would get the chance. Using Flynn to transport them to their next destination, the four Skylanders embarked on a journey to the Forest of Fear where the Key was held. They soon came in contact with the Fungus Rings of Despair that laid within the forest, trapping them in hallucinations of their worst fears. Spyro's irrational fear came to life as he saw Master Eon in chains and being tortured by Kaos, who was absolute ruler of Skylands and the entire universe in Spyro's hallucination. The young dragon broke free of his fear by blasting fire at the Kaos hallucination, and freed the other Skylanders from the grip of the Fungus Rings of Despair. The Skylanders soon found the Chattering Key, which was being guarded by the statue of a stone wyvern called Fido. Spyro devised a plan, and Gill Grunt, Boomer, and Eruptor confused the stone wyvern enough for the young dragon to snag the Key, and the Skylanders made a quick getaway with Fido in hot pursuit. Before they could leave with the key, Kaos appeared with a group of trolls, having captured Flynn. The evil tyrant revealed that he had used the Skylanders to brave the terrors of the Forest of Fear so that he was able to steal the key from them, and was willing to release Flynn in exchange for it. Not wanting to endanger Flynn's life for the sake of their mission, Spyro allowed Kaos to take the Chattering Key, and the tyrant summoned a tomb of the Pyramid of Just Rewards that contained the Arkeyan weapon, The Machine of Doom. Kaos opened the tomb, activating one of its pillars that destroyed the advancing Fido with a beam of light. The evil Portal Master then used Flynn as a hostage to keep the Skylanders from following him. With the help from the Chattering Key, Spyro and the Skylanders ventured inside the pyramid through the other side where they came across the Machine of Doom itself. As Kaos reached the Machine, Boomer eagerly tried to control the evil contraption to use it against Kaos, but instead the weapon itself began to break apart and pyramid started to crumble\u00a0around them. As Kaos laughed maniacally at Boomer trying to control The Machine of Doom, Spyro was the only one who figured out Kaos's real scheme.  The machine was really a trap designed by the Arkeyans to capture anyone who might be tempted to steal a weapon capable of destroying the Core of Light, knowing that anyone who braved their worst nightmares in the Forest of Fear, got the Chattering Key from Fido, and crazy enough to climb into an all-powerful super weapon was too dangerous to walk free. Kaos tricked the Skylanders into seizing The Machine of Doom therefore springing the trap, intending to bury the heroes alive. As Kaos and his minions were making their escape as the pyramid crumbled around them, Flynn was rescued during the chaos. Spyro attempted to stop Kaos from escaping in his transport portal, but failed when the tyrant fired a magic lightning bolt at the young dragon. Boomer, having gained full control over The Machine of Doom, used the mechanical titan to destroy the portal that Kaos was about escape in, and soon used the machine as a way to get out of the crumbling pyramid. Despite knowing that Kaos deserved to be left inside the pyramid in the very trap he tried to spring on the heroes, Spyro recalled Master Eon's ways on what the old Portal Master would do in a situation similar to the one that they were in. Making his decision, the young dragon saved Kaos from being buried alive, and the Skylanders narrowly made their escape just as the pyramid crumbled down into a pit. The Machine of Doom broke apart as a result of their escape, and the Skylanders landed outside of what was left of the pyramid while Kaos made his exit with their notice. Spyro, Gill Grunt, Eruptor, and Boomer were then greeted by Master Eon, who Spyro informed that he and the other Skylanders had underestimated Kaos, but the young dragon declared that it wouldn't happen again. Although Kaos had been stopped, Spyro was certain that this was only the beginning since the evil Portal Master would strike again, but also knew that next time, he and the Skylanders would be ready. The young dragon then celebrated their victory as Gill Grunt began to sing a song again.Skylanders: Spyro versus The Mega Monsters  Spyro was training with Drill Sergeant, Jet-Vac, and Trigger Happy in mastering his Daybringer Flame attack, but ended up failing the training session when his attempt missed a Goliath Drow illusion and singed only Drill Sergeant and Trigger Happy. Disheartened at the fact that he failed his training again, Spyro was soon tasked by Master Eon to go with Stealth Elf to Stinky Swamp to find a terrible monster the elf had encountered. After saving a Mabu named Snuckles from a couple of Chompies, Spyro and Stealth Elf were attacked by an unusually, giant titchy toad. The toad's toxic saliva caused Spyro and Stealth Elf to fall asleep during the struggle, unable to save Snuckles from the giant titchy toad that was about to devour him and the vampire vines that threatened to pull the Mabu apart. The Mabu was then saved by the arrival of Kaos, who used a magic staff to defeat the toad. The evil Portal Master claimed that he was turning over a new leaf by taking down evil doers, much to Spyro and Stealth Elf's complete disbelief. When the residents of Skylands started praising Kaos for saving them from various mega-sized creatures, Spyro suspected that Kaos was up to something, refusing to believe that the 'evil' Portal Master would suddenly turn over a new leaf out of the blue. \u00a0He, Jet-Vac, and Drill Sergeant were soon sent to The Desert of Columns to help the Molekin, Diggs, escape from a strangely familiar troll monster, but Kaos saved the day once again, greatly irritating Spyro. Back at Eon's Citadel, the Skylanders, Master Eon, and Hugo were confronted by the Warrior Librarians of the Eternal Archives lead by Chief Curator Wiggleworth, who had learned of Spyro's legendary and heroic exploits from the books of the Ancients. The Warrior Librarians had come to warn Master Eon that their Eternal Archive, a library that holds not only the dangerous books ever written, was in terrible danger.\u00a0 Upon arriving at the Archive, the Skylanders confronted a mega-sized Chompy Pod that was impervious to all of their attacks due to its current size. The plant soon spored five giant Chompies and massive fight ensured. During the battle, Spyro ultimately mastered his Daybringer Flame attack in taking down one of the large Chompies. As the Skylanders were outmatched by the remaining giants, Kaos appeared, saving the Skylanders from the giant enemies by suspending the Chompies in midair using his magic staff.  Kaos then revealed that as a child he wanted to borrow a book called World Domination for Beginners and other related books from the Eternal Archive, but was told by Wiggleworth that they weren't available for loan (in order to keep the books from falling into the wrong hands). The evil Portal Master threatened to release the giant Chompies upon the heroes if Wiggleworth didn't hand over a forbidden book to him. When Wiggleworth refused, Kaos released the Chompies to devour the group. Stealth Elf stole the magic staff from Kaos, and used its power to enlarge Spyro two times the size of the giant Chompies, allowing the dragon to defeat the giant enemies while his fellow Skylanders dealt with Kaos and destroyed his magic staff. After the battle, Spyro realized that Kaos's true plan was to test his staff on a few creatures (growing them into a giant size), trick the people of Skylands into thinking he was saving them from the mega-sized animals just so he could attack the Archive and blackmail its curator, who Kaos thought would be blinded by hero worship like others have.\u00a0 Realizing he was defeated, Kaos fled the scene, but not before revealing that his plan was only the beginning. Afterwards, some of the other Skylanders were brought to the Eternal Archive to help the Warrior Librarions repair the damage done. Master Eon congratulated Spyro on his victory in stopping Kaos, and was more surprised that the purple dragon shared the glory with his fellow Skylanders who assisted him. Spyro then accompied Master Eon after hearing that Wiggleworth wanted to show the young dragon something within the Archive's vault. The Portal Master showed Spyro the book Kaos was after, the legendary Book of Power, a book of prophecy that shows the most dreadful predictions, such as the fall of the Skylanders, and Spyro himself...Skylanders: Gill Grunt and the Curse of the Fish Master  After the other Skylanders repaired the walls of the Eternal Archives, Spyro called Gill Grunt over to the halls of the Archives so that he and the Gillmen could look into the Book of Power with Master Eon, Hugo, and Wiggleworth. The two Skylanders were horrified to see a vision in the book showing the Core of Light destroyed and darkness swarming the skies, before seeing a glimpse of the Mask of Power, an evil artifact created by a group of Spell Punks that was scattered across Skylands by the old Portal Masters long ago into eight pieces hidden in objects that were completely opposite to the fragments.  Realizing that Kaos had already found the Tech fragment of the Mask, and wanted to reassemble it to use the Mask to destroy the Core of Light, Spyro and Gill Grunt became determined to find the rest before the evil Portal Master does. Master Eon was able to find the location of the Water Fragment from the Book of Power and sent Gill Grunt to Deep Water Wasteland to locate it, while Spyro stayed behind with the old Portal Master. Spyro soon came to Deep Water Wasteland after hearing from Master Eon that the Gill Grunt was having trouble with pirates lead by Captain Grimslobber, but was relieved that Gill Grunt managed to escape with the help of Zap and Wham-Shell. The young dragon then revealed that Kaos was looking for the Water Fragment as well, and the trio of Water Skylanders quickly continued on with their mission, leaving Spyro to worry about Zap's well-being before he returned to Master Eon via portal. Spyro later assisted Gill Grunt, Wham-Shell, and Zap in their battle against Captain Grimslobber and his band of pirates aboard the Fearsome Fang, successfully winning the struggle with the help of the merfolk. When Grimslobber fell overboard and was eaten alive by a Cloud Kraken, Kaos appeared and revealed that he had beaten the Skylanders to the Fish Master's Crown that supposedly contained the Water Fragment to the Mask of Power. As the evil Portal Master made his leave, Spyro, Gill Grunt, Zap, and Wham-Shell quickly made their escape off of Grimslobber's sinking ship and back in the vault of the Eternal Archives. It had seemed the Skylanders had failed their mission, but Gill Grunt checked Grimslobber's satchel he brought back with him and held a dirty rag the captain had used to wrap the Fish Master's Crown. The rag soon revealed itself to be the Water Fragment, making the Skylanders realize that Kaos had stolen nothing more than a worthless broken crown. Knowing that Kaos would be after the next fragment to the Mask of Power, Spyro and Gill Grunt both knew that the Skylanders would be ready for him.Skylanders: Cynder Confronts the Weather Wizard  Spyro's only appearance was when Cynder, Hex, and Zook returned to the Eternal Archives after retrieving the Undead segment to the Mask of Power. The purple dragon proceeded to inform his allies that Master Eon was kidnapped and the culprit was Squirmgrub, a Warrior Librarian traitor who was working for Kaos all this time.Skylanders: Stump Smash Crosses the Bone Dragon  With Master Eon kidnapped, Spyro became temporary leader of the Skylanders in his place. Without a Portal Master, it was difficult for the Skylanders to search about Skylands for Eon and Kaos without the use of a Portal. Spyro furiously lashed out at Chief Curator Wiggleworth for trusting Squirmgrub, who was a traitor, and blamed him for Master Eon's capture. Stump Smash managed to calm Spyro down, but the young dragon still blamed himself for what happened to Master Eon. Hugo soon revealed that the Giggling Forest has stopped laughing for some reason, and Spyro assigned Stump Smash, Wrecking Ball and Flameslinger to find out what was going on. After the group's close encounter with the Bone Dragon, Spyro attempted to negotiate with Glumshanks into telling the Skylanders where Kaos was. The purple dragon was able to trick the troll butler into blurting out Kaos's exact location by pretending to be unimpressed with the evil Portal Master, and Glumshanks became defensive of his master. Upon learning where Kaos was, Spyro went with Flameslinger and the other Skylanders to the Giggling Forest to find the Bone Dragon, only to overwhelmed. Spyro, along with other Skylanders, were turned into a statue by the rampaging Bone Dragon's petrifying breath despite their best efforts.\u00a0 Fortunately, Stump Smash was able to bring down and convince the Bone Dragon to un-petrify everyone, including Spyro, returning them to normal. Kaos however also recovered and began firing dark magic at the Skylanders as he attempted to capture the Bone Dragon who was believed to the Life Segment to the Mask of Power. Master Eon quickly casted a few quick spells to subdue Kaos and his minions, and revealed that the Life Segment wasn't the Bone Dragon, but a stone heart that was given to the creature years prior. Defeated, Kaos retreats, but not before vowing revenge. Spyro quickly detained Squirmgrub, whose armor was shattered by Master Eon and was intentionally left behind by Kaos. With the evil Portal Master gone, and the Bone Dragon returning to his eternal rest, Spyro and the Skylanders celebrated their victory, but it was far from over.Skylanders: Trigger Happy Targets the Evil Kaos  Spyro was sent to bring\u00a0Trigger Happy, Smolderdash and Food Fight\u00a0back to Eon's Citadel after their battle with the Water Viper. He soon accompanied the three Skylanders to Wool Mountain to find the Magic segment to the Mask of Power that was revealed to have taken on the form of a sheep. During the search, Kaos arrived with six troll fighter planes and began attacking all of the sheep. With the help of Trigger Happy, Spyro was able to destroy the planes in time for the other Skylanders to find the Magic segment to the Mask of Power. However soon after retrieving the segment, all of the Mask of Power segments were stolen by a Goliath Drow who was serving Kaos. Spyro, along with the other Skylanders who previously took part in the search of the parts of the Mask of Power, were teleported to Kaos' Kastle to stop Kaos from using the Mask of Power. Despite getting through the castle's defenses, the Skylanders were unable to stop Kaos from putting on the Mask of Power. With it, Kaos was able to steal the Skylanders' powers, including Spyro's, leaving them defenseless. Before the evil Portal Master could finish the Skylanders off, they were safely teleported back to Eon's Citadel. As Kaos began to spread havoc across Skylands, Spyro was the one who lifted the Skylanders' spirits when they began to lose hope. With his guidance, the Skylanders were able to build a makeshift tower around the Core of Light in an attempt to protect it. When Kaos came to the island, the Skylanders were once again outmatched by the Mask of Power's abilities and Master Eon was also subdued by Kaos. Before Kaos could unleash his attack on the Core of Light, Trigger Happy, joined by the other Skylanders, coaxed Kaos into using all of their abilities at the same time, causing the evil Portal Master to spiral out of control. The Mask of Power was then yanked off Kaos's face, restoring all of the Skylanders back their powers and allowing them to fully destroy the Mask of Power. With Kaos defeated once again, Spyro knew that the evil Portal Master would return, but is certain that he and the Skylanders will be ready for him.Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure  Spyro and Trigger Happy were present with Master Eon, when Kaos and The Darkness approached the Citadel one day. As Kaos summoned his minions to destroy the Core of Light, Spyro was the first to charge into battle before the other present Skylanders, taking out several red Cyclops Choppers and Trolls with his horns before taking airborne to fight the enemies from the air. He was briefly seen during the fight flying about while being pursued by a Cyclops Mammoth. Despite their best efforts however, Kaos destroyed the Core of Light using his Hydra. Spyro, along with the other Skylanders, were banished from Skylands to Earth, where they were turned into toys as a result of that world having no magic. While being frozen, Spyro spent much of his time planning on how to lead his Skylanders home, also crossing the mind of breathing fire at Kaos in retaliation for banishing him and the Skylanders to Earth. Soon, a new Portal Master was assigned by Master Eon to lead Spyro and the Skylanders back to Skylands to stop Kaos's tyranny. After Kaos was defeated, Spyro, Gill Grunt, and Trigger Happy were the only Skylanders present at the Ruins with Flynn, Cali, Hugo, and Master Eon, listening to Kaos making idle threats in his temporary prison. The three Skylanders all shared a knowing glance to one another, as Kaos rambled on promising to return until Skylands was his if he was to be banished to the Outlands again. Instead, Kaos was sent to Earth where he was turned into a toy, and shortly after his departure, Spyro, Gill Grunt, and Trigger Happy celebrated their victory together.Skylanders: The Kaos Trap  When Hugo called upon the other Skylander teams to assist Stealth Elf, Pop Fizz and Wash Buckler against an army of trolls at the Radiant Isles, Spyro's team of Skylanders was unable to go and help out as they were busy battling a Drow Raiding Squad. The purple dragon then suggested Hugo to contact Gill Grunt's team of Skylanders to see if they were available.Skylanders: Champions  Spyro is the Skylander who helps crown the winner of the Legendary Tournament and is notably one of the past crowned champions of the arena.\u00a0According to D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu, he is the most legendary of\u00a0all\u00a0Skylanders.\u00a0When D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu felt discouraged by Fist Bump, Trail Blazer, and Fling Kong before the Finals, Spyro approached the girl and lifted her spirits by telling her about how he became a Skylander, his adventures in Skylands, and how raw power alone doesn't make Skylanders powerful. He encouraged\u00a0D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu to believe in herself just before the finals began.\u00a0D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu would later win the tournament thanks to Spyro's support. With his fire breath, the purple dragon then sculpted a block of metal into a statue of\u00a0D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu\u00a0that now stands alongside other statues of previous champions of the tournament.\u00a0 Sometime after the tournament, Spyro rescued a sprite named Calliope from a sea creature in the mini-story,\u00a0Sprite Fight. Unknown to Spyro, Calliope stole his powers from him while she was thanking the young dragon.Skylanders: Return of the Dragon King  Spyro, Spy Rise, Weeruptor, Jet-Vac and Wallop were hidden onboard Gurglefin's ship while it was enroute to the Wilikin Village. When the ship became ambushed by Captain Frightbeard and his group of Cyclops pirates, the Skylanders leapt out from the ship's trap door to battle their enemies. While taking on Captain Frightbeard, Spyro's fire breath was ineffective against the large seadog, confusing the young dragon. He was quickly pulled back by Spy Rise in time to avoid Frightbeard's swinging blade and Wallop took the chance to knock the pirate unconscious. Afterwards, everyone on the ship wondered what was going on with Spyro's fire breath, and they concluded that they may find answers back at the Skylanders Academy.  Once there, Spyro was placed inside one of Mags' inventions to detect anything wrong with him. However after the scan, the readings revealed that Spyro was healthy despite him losing his abilities. Hex soon arrived after a Drow ambush and revealed that her powers were affected as well. After talking with Persephone, the Fairy Queen revealed that all but Spyro and Hex's most simplest of powers were stolen. Spyro and Hex both remembered their encounter with Calliope, discovering that she was the same fairy who used her magic to steal their powers. With the help of Mags' wrench to detect Calliope's magical signature, Spyro and Hex travelled to the Cadaverous Crypts\u00a0with Mags, Flynn and Wallop to track down Calliope. Along the way, they came upon Cynder being cornered by Rotting Robbies and Bone Chompies. Wallop, Hex and Spyro saved the dragoness, who revealed that her powers were also stolen by Calliope. The four Skylanders followed Mags' direction to where Calliope went and they pursued the fairy through the caves. Before the Skylanders could stop Calliope from breaking her crystal that held their powers, she shattered the gem under orders of a dark shadow, who absorbed the powers of Spyro, Hex and Cynder to revive himself. As the Skylanders looked upon their enemy, recognizing him, they were struck down and knocked unconscious by a massive fire breath released by none other than the Undead Dragon King Malefor. When coming back to their senses, Spyro and the other Skylanders found themselves imprisoned. Calliope, who was tending to them, explained that because of their actions against his plans, Malefor had decided to take revenge by destroying what they had worked hard for - the Skylanders Academy. Unable to escape on their own, Cynder took out her frustration on the fairy, but Spyro intervened by pointing out that Cynder - who he forgave despite her dark past - should know better than to blame Calliope for everything. Cynder apologized and tried to convince the fairy to help them with Hex by sharing their experiences with Malefor and their sacrifices, but Calliope was ashamed and ran away. Fortunately, Flynn and Mags soon arrived to free them, and they set off to stop Malefor before he destroyed the school. Once at the Academy, Spyro boldly challenged Malefor to a fight he'll never forget with Hex, Cynder and Wallop by his side.  Despite Malefor's boasting, Spyro, Cynder, Hex and Wallop stood their ground, willing to fight Malefor for the fate of Skylands. By distracting him, the Skylanders had Mags trap Malefor with chewing gum and the Dread-Yacht was redirected towards Malefor by Hex's magic, crashing the vessel into him, but it only slightly damaged his armor. The evil dragon once again attacked, directing his fury towards Spyro, who Malefor claimed to have fought before time and time again. This confused the group as Hex was the one who defeated him before. Unable to do any further damage, they were starting to lose the battle again until Calliope and Persephone intervened, and directed Spyro to attack Malefor's chestplate to reveal the crystal he used to drain the Skylanders' powers. To destroy the chestplate, Hex used a spell on Spyro that would redirect his speed into a stronger impact with an orb. Once it was out of the way, Spyro destroyed the crystal inside and released the powers of all defeated Skylanders, restoring their strength. Malefor attempted to keep attacking despite this setback, but at full power, the Skylanders managed to quickly tie his tail to the Dread-Yacht's anchor. With Wallop throwing the ship over the island, Malefor was dragged along. Despite his pleas of help to Calliope, she and the others only watched as Malefor plummeted to the lower parts of Skylands. Spyro afterwards wondered why Malefor believed they both fought before, only for Master Eon to point out that despite the young dragon's memories being fragmented, the present is what matters. Calliope regretted having starting the trouble of Malefor to begin with, but Master Eon assured that the Skylanders Academy would be rebuilt and the Skylanders and their allies would help her find her family regardless.Skylanders: Rift into Overdrive  During the last day of school at the Skylander Academy, Spyro engaged Stealth Elf in a friendly pie-eating contest, but lost. Three months later after Kaos' escape from the Villain Vault, the purple dragon quickly came to Master Eon when Skylands was being threatened by strange rifts that consume everything in their path and disrupt the connection between the Portals, turning them off completely. As the nearby Skylanders gathered at the Academy's courtyard, Spyro calmed their concerns and explained to them about a great threat Kaos was using to cut off the connections between Portals. While Spyro remained at the Skylander Academy, he enlisted Stealth Elf, Jet-Vac, Terrafin and Gill Grunt to go to Know-It-All Island and see if the Stone Heads know something about the Rift Engines. Spyro overlooked the defenses around Skylander Academy in preparation for any Kaos attack could pull. The defenses were then put to the test when Kaos launched an assault on the school with an airship armada. Thanks to the Omni-Disruptor that was retrieved from Magus' castle (Issue #5), Mags was able to call in Skylander reinforcements through a broadcast across all of Skylands. Hordes of Skylanders soon arrived to aid in the defense of the Skylanders Academy, partially scaring away Kaos' attack force and earning the heroes their victory. However Spyro is certain that the war was far from over, knowing that all hope lies on the Rift Engines that Jet-Vac, Stealth Elf, Terrafin and Gill Grunt were sent to find.Skylanders: Secret Agent Secrets  After the events of Skylanders: SuperChargers, Spyro is first seen arguing with Kaos, who had appointed himself as the Skylander Academy's Evil Consultant of Ultimate Evil. The purple dragon expressed his distrust of the dark Portal Master, assuming Kaos was up to no good as always. Eventually both Spyro and Kaos were forced to cooperate and work out a plan when Buzz pointed out that his elite team of Skylanders, Boomer, Ghost Roaster and Voodood, had disappeared while on a convert mission and hadn't reported in for months. Spyro and Kaos appointed SuperChargers, Spitfire, Stormblade and Nightfall, their first mission to find the lost Skylanders at what was left of Motleyville. While waiting for Spitfire, Stormblade and Nightfall to report back on their mission, Spyro and Kaos once again got into an heated argument. Before things could escalate into violence, Mags was forced to step in and place Spyro and Kaos in timeout. Knowing that the Skylanders Academy was depending on their leadership, Spyro offered to treat Kaos the respect an ally deserves as they are now on the same side. Now on better terms, both Spyro and Kaos pinpointed the location where the missing Skylanders have disappeared. Spyro then left the Academy under Buzz and Kaos's care as he sent himself to search for their comrades. It is presumed that he found the missing Skylanders off-screen after they defeated the evil Spell Punk Spellslamzer.Skylanders: Imaginators  Spyro is one of the fan-favorite Skylanders who played an active role of guiding the player and their Skylanders through certain levels. In the introduction, Spyro engaged Stealth Elf in a friendly race around Skylander Academy, ending with Stealth Elf being the victor. Suddenly, a streak of magic shot into the academy library and a Doomlander emerged, stealing a book about Imaginite. While Spyro and Stealth Elf attempted to engage the creature, it proved to be too strong for them. It was fortunately driven away by the arrival of the Senseis. Spyro later tracked down the Doomlander to the Cradle of Creation where Master Eon instructed the young dragon to meet up with the new Portal Master and their Imaginator. As Spyro expected, the evil mastermind and the creator of the Doomlander was Kaos.  When the Skylander defeated Kaos's Doomlander, Spyro congratulated their efforts and returned to M.A.P. with them to meet up with Stealth Elf. Afterwards, the dragon Skylander lent his assistance to his fellow teammates through the story until Kaos and Brain used Mind Magic to brainwash all of Skylands, including the other Skylanders. Because he was a dragon, Spyro was immune to the mind control spell and journeyed to the Dragon Temple with the Skylander to find out a way to reverse the spell that had also occured thousands of years ago. After finding the other Dragons, they and Spyro used their dragon magic to undo the brainwashing spell across most of Skylands, freeing the other Skylanders. Spyro then helped the other Skylanders bake a giant cake that they would use to infiltrate Kaos's new inpenetrable fortress. Once inside, the Skylanders took their battle to Kaos and Brain with the help of the new Portal Master and their Imaginators. Spyro and the other Skylanders quickly captured Brain after he switched sides and assisted the heroes against Kaos, threatening the Ancient because of his previous loyalty to Kaos. The dragon was skeptical that Brain was trustworthy after his claims of turning over a new leaf, but seemingly gained his trust when Brain shrunk Kaos and Glumshanks and trapped them inside a jar. As part of a deal he made with the Skylanders, Brain was appointed the new professor of Skylanders Academy and began telling the Skylanders a story offscreen. In the Thumpin' Wumpa Islands, Spyro accompanied Mags to the Wumpa Islands but discovered that Dr. Neo Cortex's latest invention had inadvertantly caused the islands' musical vibes to go off-beat. While investigating the island's disturbance, Spyro caught sight of Fake Crash wearing a robot suit that was causing the bad vibes and guided the Skylander around the island with Mags.Relationships Cynder  After Spyro defeated Cynder, he believed she can be something more other than being a former minion of Malefor. Both of them embarked on a dangerous quest together, which resulted in Cynder smiling presumably for the first time. Spyro then convinced Master Eon to sign her up as a Skylander. Ever since then, he regards Cynder as one of his oldest friends and one of the greatest Skylanders.Gill Grunt  Spyro is best friends with Gill Grunt (or Gill as Spyro often calls him). As a result of being few of the first modern Skylanders, Gill Grunt and Spyro have been working together a little longer than some of the other Skylanders, forming a friendship based on longevity and shared experiences; both having defended Skylands from darkness and tyranny on countless occasions. According to Spyro, Gill Grunt is the bravest Gillman he has ever met. Although Gill Grunt's dreadful singing makes the young dragon's scales tremble, Spyro, like the other Skylanders, is just too fond of the blue Gillman to tell him the truth that he sounds like a bullfrog gargling stale jelly.Trigger Happy  Other than Gill Grunt, Spyro is also best friends with Trigger Happy (or Trig as Spyro often calls him), having worked together with the gremlin since their days as the first few modern Skylanders. Their friendship is based on longevity and their shared experiences with each other. Although Spyro is normally confused by Trigger Happy's wacky nature and his way of handling bad guys.Hex  Despite her dark past, Spyro doesn't doubt Hex's loyalties, but doesn't agree with her way of attempting to solve things without help.Master Eon  Spyro is extremely loyal to the old Portal Master. The young dragon looks up to Master Eon, viewing him as a mentor. Unfortunately, ever since he had met Eon, Spyro had been afraid that one day the old Portal Master would fall to Kaos. His worst nightmare came to life in The Machine of Doom as an hallucination when Spyro was affected by the spores of the Fungus Rings of Despair. He was forced to watch Master Eon being tortured by Kaos, while the young dragon could do nothing to help his mentor. It was until Spyro broke through the hallucination did he free himself from his worst nightmare. As a result of learning from Master Eon, the old Portal Master's ways influenced Spyro to save his archenemy, Kaos, from a fate the evil tyrant tried to bring upon the young dragon and three of his Skylander friends in The Machine of Doom, despite Spyro wanting to leave Kaos in the very trap he tried to spring. In times when Master Eon is absent, Spyro takes over as temporary leader of the Skylanders.Kaos  Spyro, like all in Skylands, hates Kaos, the villainous Portal Master who is also the Skylanders' archenemy. The young dragon shudders at the thought of Kaos ruling Skylands and the universe, and Spyro would do whatever it takes to stop the evil Portal Master from fulfilling his evil plans. Although Kaos was a joke at a basic level, Spyro however, underestimated Kaos's seriousness as a villain, and discovered the evil Portal Master's inner deviousness in The Machine of Doom, revealing to the young dragon that Kaos can be a dangerous adversary. There were a few instances of Spyro saving Kaos when the evil Portal Master nearly gets himself hurt. During these moments, the young dragon considered leaving Kaos to his doom or letting him get injured. But as a Skylander, doing such things would make Spyro no better than Kaos himself, and the purple dragon ends up saving his archenemy. When Kaos was becoming 'hero of the hour' in Spyro Versus The Mega Monsters, Spyro refused to believe the evil Portal Master had turned over a new leaf, knowing that Kaos \"is as evil as they come\". This doubt was proven true when Kaos revealed his true colors in the end. Spyro had also shown signs of irritation when he was saved by Kaos more than once. In Secret Agent Secrets, Spyro and Kaos are seen in a heated argument with one another, sometime after Kaos began staying at the Skylanders Academy as \"Evil Consultant of Ultimate Evil\". Knowing well of Kaos' evil deeds and devious nature, the purple dragon assumed Kaos was up to no good again and was trying to separate the Skylanders. Kaos demanded Spyro to listen to his orders since he is the self-appointed 'Evil Consultant of Ultimate Evil' and claims that he knows all the signs of impending evil. Eventually the two are forced to cooperate and worked out a plan when Buzz's team of Skylanders had disappeared while on a mission. However this alliance didn't last long as Kaos's inflated ego greatly infuriated Spyro, causing another argument to erupt between the two. Before a fight broke out, Mags stepped in and forced Spyro and Kaos to go into time-out in order for them to work out their problems. Knowing that the Skylanders Academy was depending on their leadership, Spyro apologized to Kaos for not giving him the respect he deserved. The purple dragon then offered to treat as an ally and put aside their differences since they were now on the same side. Both Spyro and Kaos were then able cooperate without conflict, having finally agreed to work together and use their knowledge and leadership to help the Skylanders Academy survive. However their cooperation was short-lived as Kaos went back to his villainous ways in Skylanders: Imaginators.Malefor  Spyro never met Malefor prior to his first encounter with the Dragon King, but was aware of Malefor's self-proclaimed status and had fought his minions in the past. He is confused by Malefor's claims of having previously fought Spyro, but the young dragon has no memory of ever facing Malefor other than knowing that Hex was the one who defeated the evil Dragon King.Calliope  When Calliope was responsible for Malefor's return, Spyro was one of the two Skylanders who didn't express animosity towards the fairy and notably was the one who defended her from Cynder's aggression since he knew that Malefor was behind Calliope's actions. He was confident that he and his friends would be able to escape their predicament with Calliope's help, but when she tearfully refused and fled, Spyro wished for Calliope to let the Skylanders help whatever was troubling her. During the Skylanders battle against Malefor at the Skylanders Academy, Spyro's trust in the fairy was renewed when Calliope redeemed herself by pointing out Malefor's weakness, which not only caused Malefor's defeat but the restoration of the Skylanders' powers.Crash Bandicoot  Although the origins of their friendship is currently unknown, Aku Aku calls Spyro an old friend of Crash.Dr. Neo Cortex  Spyro strongly insists Cortex to fix the mess he made disrupting the good musical vibes on Wumpa Island. After a while though, the dragon feels that he's been giving the Doctor a hard time and compliments on Cortex's attempts to fix the bad vibes on the island.Abilities  Being a rare purple dragon associated with the Magic element, Spyro has the ability to harness the power of the other elements, though he prefers to master fire. He can also combine the powers of The Darkness with his own to become Dark Spyro, but always runs the risk of losing himself to the dark magic. Using his horns, and infusing them with the element of fire, Spyro can charge at his enemies and knock down obstacles. Being a dragon, Spyro also has the ability to fly. In gameplay terms, Spyro is a versatile character, being both effective at close range combat with his Charge and Earth Pound attacks, and capable at mid and long-range combat with his Flameballs. He is notably one of the fastest and most agile Skylanders in the game, especially when taking into account his Flight and Charge abilities. His upgrade paths either let him specialize in large area of effect damage with his Flameball's firebreath, or adding additional strength to his Charge.Console Stats  These are the starting and maximum statistics for this Skylander in the console version of the games.Power Stats  Warning: These stats are not used in any of the Skylander games.

The Dragon's Peak Adventure Pack is the only product he is included in.Background Personality  Like all dragons, Sunburn is quite the prankster, but hates evil with a passion.Biography  Born in the center of an active volcano, Sunburn is part dragon, part phoenix, and 100% fire power. He is very proud of his unique heritage, and is the only dragon and phoenix hybrid known to exist in Skylands. This rare combination makes him a desirable target for dark wizards and bounty hunters who seek to gain power by unlocking the secrets behind Sunburn\u2019s ability to teleport. Joining the Skylanders gave Sunburn a way to help defend the world from evil, but also provided him with protection, as he remains one of the most sought after creatures in Skylands.Story History  For years, soothsayers and psychics had predicted the birth of a dragon-phoenix cross. So, when the newly hatched Sunburn was catapulted into the world from his cozy volcanic nest, he became the drag-nix (or phoe-gon?) everyone wanted to meet. Sunburn became a target for every thief, bandit and evil sorcerer who wanted a piece of his powers. Thankfully, being able to both throw flames and teleport was a handy defense. Still for Sunburn, Skylands was not a safe place. Luckily, Master Eon also noticed his amazing abilities and made him a Skylander. This not only provided Sunburn with protection, but gave him a license to incinerate evil. It also provided plenty of opportunities to play teleporting pranks on his new teammates.Abilities  Sunburn has the ability to breathe streams of fire. He also has a unique ability to teleport from one place to another, leaving a trail of flames behind. It is said that his body temperature is so hot that his very molecules can't remain in one place and will teleport to a new location. Truth to be told, this ability has nothing to do with temperature, but is in fact a side effect of Sunburn being the only known half-dragon half-phoenix to exist.Console Stats  These are the starting and maximum statistics for this Skylander in the console version of the games.Power Stats  Warning: These stats are not used in any of the Skylander games.

Originally a servant of The Dark Master Malefor, Cynder was the main antagonist in The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning until she was defeated and freed by Spyro. She now seeks to find her own destiny, eventually evolving into a heroine.Character Development  Cynder was one of the rare opportunities for Krome Studios to create a female villain character in The Legend of Spyro series that was both unique and fresh design wise. But they also felt as if she had been a part of the Spyro mythology for quite some time. The story for the first installment of the trilogy, A New Beginning, called for \"a powerful and shadowy dark dragon\" to be Spyro's nemesis, beyond that no specification was given and the starting point was very loose. Bruno Rime, Cynder's character designer and art lead of the project in Krome Studios, determined that this villain be female and a black dragon, as the previous dragon villain in the earlier Spyro titles (Red) was generally red coloured. For both Bruno Rime and Jared Pullen, another artist who worked on A New Beginning, from the get go presence was paramount, and the black dragon Maleficent from the Disney movie Sleeping Beauty had that in spades. They used the villainess's reference in terms of her lithe, sinuous form, which they adopted for Cynder's overall body structure. But pretty soon, Bruno was exploring Gothic overtones in keeping with the visual cues of Concurrent Skies, the environment that Cynder was first encountered in. The platinum jewelry was evident as a personal touch for the 'evil' version of Cynder and served to signify her as both feminine and regal, but also gave the impressions of servitude, as if the decoration about her throat was less a necklace and more a manacle, indicating her enslavement to Malefor's thrall. The development team later went on to call Cynder a \"Midnight Dragon,\" owing to this Gothic nature, and all the design work was handled by Bruno. There were about three or four iterations on her design from memory, as Bruno had a strong vision for who Cynder was visually. During development, Cynder was referred to as \"The Anti-Spyro\" and the Apes were known as \"Anti-Spyro Soldiers.\" Knowing that they couldn't ship the game with those names in place, the development team ran an internal competition for the final name for the female dragon villain at both Krome Studios and Vivendi Universal (now branded Activision) and after about three weeks, they chose the name Jared Pullen called the black dragon Cynder. Late during the story's development, Spyro and Cynder weren't originally intended to fall in love with each other. This is supported by their lack of interest in each other up until the final battle in Dawn of the Dragon. However seeing the fans wanting Spyro and Cynder to be together prompted Krome Studios and The Legend of Spyro producers to consider making the pairing canon. \"I think it's now common-place belief (if not unwritten lore) that they are an item.\" Jared Pullen stated, \"It's the way I would have eventually gone with it. But since the fans wanted to see them together, the team obliged.\"Appearance  Cynder is a black dragon with emerald-green eyes, a ruby underbelly, a tail-blade and blades on her wing carpals, big wings with ruby membranes, and six silver-white horns on her head. In her adult form, she wore two platinum bracers\u00a0on her wrists, a platinum choker on her neck,\u00a0and another pair of\u00a0bracers on her tail. Curiously, she wears them again in her teenage form in Dawn of the Dragon. Cynder also has symbols on her forehead, back, shoulders, and around her eyes, which are the result of Malefor's corruption. When in the form she is in for the majority of The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning, she is much larger than usual. Some other attributes of that form are her longer neck, long, lean body, different wings, and a more pointed, adult-looking face.Personality  As an egg in the same clutch as Spyro, Cynder was stolen by Malefor's dark forces and born under his influence. Malefor's powerful magic transformed Cynder into a lithe, monstrous dragon who was the classic femme fatale: unstable, alternately calm, but explosive, caring about nothing but the return of her master. After she was freed from Malefor's control, Cynder felt guilty about all of the things she had done while under his corruption and thrives to discover her own destiny and help fight against her former master. In Dawn of the Dragon, Cynder's personality is explored. She is cunning, intelligent, witty, resourceful, brave, spirited, determined, independent, and isn't afraid to speak her mind. Despite her damsel-in-distress role in the previous two games, Cynder is far from passive and doesn't enjoy such roles of frail and weak heroines. For instance, when Spyro was telling Cynder to follow his lead, she immediately responded in an indignant tone, \"Why should you lead?\". Her time as Malefor's puppet traumatized her deeply that she quickly becomes upset whenever anyone mentions her dark past or the possibility of her still being evil and returning to Malefor's side, something that happens rather often. Cynder strongly dislikes being chained in any form (physical or psychologically), shown by her desire to find her destiny and frequent irritation over the green chain. Cynder shows strong determination to help others and prove that she isn't the monster she once was. Her feelings are so strong that she wants to do all she can to keep her loved ones safe, and becomes brave enough to show Spyro hints about her romantic feelings before fully revealing them at the end of the third game.Abilities  When first introduced in A New Beginning, as a result of Malefor's corruption, Cynder was made to age at a much quicker rate than an ordinary dragon, giving her the body of an adult dragon despite being the same age as Spyro. In this form, Cynder possessed enormous power, being able to subdue a powerful dragon like Ignitus. Her true abilities aren't seen until the end of the game, though she is hinted to be incredibly powerful, as the Guardians (all of whom are masters of their respective elements and rather powerful dragons) spoke of her in a fearful manner and her assault caused Spyro (a dragon known for his bravery) to flee in fear. During her fight with Spyro, she reveals that she has excellent melee combat abilities, being able to attack Spyro at any angle he approaches from. She also displayed a unique ability known as Shadow Breath, which is powerful enough to cause rock to catch fire and deal significant damage to Spyro. She seemed to have lost most (if not all) of these abilities upon being purged of Malefor's influence and returning to her natural form. Despite this, throughout The Eternal Night, Cynder has been implied to be a capable fighter. She displayed enough confidence in her skills to travel the realms alone, and both the Skavengers and the Ape King appeared confident enough in her skills to pit her against Spyro, despite possessing no elemental abilities at the time (though in the latter case, Spyro had his elemental abilities drained in addition to being physically weakened by the Ape King's staff). Malefor's corruption granted Cynder abilities most uncommon among Dragons. She has the ability to use Poison, Fear, Wind, and Shadow as her breath attacks, which were given to her in Dawn of the Dragon. Aether is also one of the abilities that was unwillingly bestowed upon her by Malefor. It is interesting to note that Cynder appears to have greater reserves of magic than Spyro, despite the latter being a purple dragon (who are renowned for their enormous elemental and magical potential), though this may due to the fact she was exposed to the dark magic of a fallen purple dragon. Cynder has also displayed great skills in melee combat (exceeding Spyro in terms of skill and speed, although not as physically strong), and favours using quick strikes and dodging using her natural speed and agility, performing complex and highly acrobatic attacks within close proximity.Story The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning  Cynder was born in the same clutch of dragon eggs that Spyro was in during the Year of the Dragon, making her and Spyro the same age. On the night the Dark Armies raided the Dragon Temple, the Ape King Gaul kidnapped Cynder's egg, choosing her to be the dragon who would free the essence of the Dark Master, Malefor, from his prison in Convexity. She was then corrupted by Malefor's dark powers, which transformed her into a monstrous and horrific, adult dragon brainwashed to do Malefor's bidding. Becoming the general of Malefor's army, Cynder led the Apes in the war against the Dragon race and the Guardians. She captured three of the Guardians in order to drain their elemental powers into a crystal that would be used as a key to free Malefor. The Fire Dragon, Ignitus, was the only Guardian who managed to escape and hide from Cynder. Eventually, the Dragons lost the war due to Cynder's intervention. The evil dragon took control over the islands and the surrounding land, putting them under her iron rule, all the while searching for Ignitus in order to drain his elemental power. Cynder's terrifying fury and the war's aftermath led to the deaths of many Dragons, dwindling their numbers. Years later, Cynder was informed of Spyro's existence in the Swamp by an Ape Leader and she immediately scoured the area in search of the young dragon, but failed to locate him. While in Dante's Freezer, Cynder was seen flying high in the clouds above the area, leaving the island after draining the elemental energy from the Electric Guardian, Volteer, whom she left under the unknowing watch of the Ice King. She later appeared on Tall Plains, allowing her forces to enslave the Atlawa tribe and disrupting the shrine of the island's god, the Stone Sentinel. Once she had extracted the elemental power of Ice from the Ice Guardian Cyril, Cynder flew off with the crystal in tow, leaving the Atlawas to deal with their enraged god, who inadvertently became Cynder's guard to Cyril.  Moments after Spyro saved Terrador on Munitions Forge, Cynder emerged from a lava pool and retrieved the crystal charged by the Earth Guardian's energy. Terrador attempted to stop her, but Cynder defeated him with relative ease. When Cynder caught sight of Spyro, she immediately chased after him through the island as the volcano of Boyzitbig erupted. As she was about to catch Spyro, Cynder was attacked by Ignitus, who intervened to save the young dragon. A brief aerial struggle between the two large dragons ensued until both Cynder and Ignitus descended towards the unknown. The evil dragon emerged as the victor, capturing Ignitus and taking him to her fortress in Concurrent Skies where she began draining his energy into the crystal. After learning how to utilize the element of Earth, Spyro ventured to Concurrent Skies to rescue Ignitus. Cynder soon became aware of Spyro's presence within her fortress and confronted the young dragon at the very peak of her lair where Ignitus was being held, stopping Spyro from destroying the crystal before engaging him in battle. After a brief fight, she escaped to Convexity with the crystal after it was fully charged with Ignitus's elemental energy. After learning about Cynder's past from Ignitus, Spyro became determined to stop Cynder from freeing Malefor and followed her to the altar in Convexity. However, he arrived too late, as the evil dragon had already triggered the portal and provided Malefor's essence with a means of escape. Once she saw Spyro, Cynder engaged him in battle once more, willing to fight the young purple dragon to the bitter end. After a fierce and climatic battle, she was ultimately defeated by Spyro's Aether fury, and Cynder's body was freed from Malefor's control, reverting her back to her true form: a young dragon the same size and age as Spyro. However, the portal to Malefor's prison began to open and it began to pulling debris towards it, including Cynder's unconscious form. Despite a difference of opinion between him and Sparx, Spyro rescued Cynder and escaped from Convexity, making a narrow escape. Cynder was returned to the Dragon Temple, where the four Guardians apologized to her for not guarding her on the night of the raid. That evening, Cynder found Spyro at one of the temple's balconies looking for signs of Malefor's return. She joined him, and they both knew that Malefor wasn't defeated yet.The Legend of Spyro: The Eternal Night  A number of weeks had passed since Cynder's defeat at the hands of Spyro. During that time period, she lived in the Dragon Temple with Spyro and the other Guardians. Every day that went by however, Cynder felt guilty for all the things she had done while under Malefor's control. That guilt eventually was what lead the black dragon to leave the Dragon Temple one night to find her own place in the world, despite Spyro's pleas for her not to. Cynder was later captured by a group of Skavengers, who recognized her as the \"former queen of conquer\", and intended to have her as a combatant in their fighting arena, Fellmuth. Spyro was soon taken prisoner as well and forced to fight other opponents. After defeating his lastest combatant, he was shocked to find out that Cynder was to be his next challenger. Despite appearing to be evil again, the black dragon reassured Spyro by telling him to fake the fight so they could figure out on what to do next. However, the fight was interrupted when Gaul's Ape army launched an attack on Fellmuth, and in the midst of the chaos, Cynder was captured once again.  Within the main chamber of the Well of Souls, Cynder was brought before Gaul, who planned to leave her fate in the hands of the Dark Master Malefor. The Ape King told Cynder that Malefor would either take her back for being a 'faithful' servant, or destroy her. Spyro, who was told of Cynder's chosen path by the Chronicler, travelled to the Mountain of Malefor to save the black dragon from returning to Malefor's side. When he arrived at the Well of Souls, Gaul ordered Cynder to attack a weakened Spyro, and it seemed that she apparently wanted to fight him. However, this was proven to be another ruse when Cynder quietly instructed Spyro to line her up with Gaul's staff. As the fight started, she made an effort to snatch the staff, but Gaul caught Cynder by the neck and threw her to the wall, knocking her out. As Gaul and Spyro battled one another, the floor gave way underneath them and they fell to the lower level. The Celestial Moons eclipsed each other, and its evil energy zapped through Spyro, transforming him into Dark Spyro, who swiftly and cruelly destroyed Gaul. Cynder regained consciousness sometime before the battle's end, and along with Sparx, peered into the hole Spyro and Gaul fell through, wondering what was happening down below. After Spyro flew back to the chamber's upper level, Cynder was horrified to see Spyro as a creature of darkness, and quickly knocked him out of the Lunar Alignment's energy beam, returning Spyro to normal. Spyro apologized for his inability to control his Dark form, though Cynder forgave him, stating that he was with friends. However, as a result of Spyro's battle with Gaul, the mountain began to collapse. Cynder spotted an opening big enough for all three of them to escape through, but Spyro was left weakened from his battle with Gaul and urged Cynder and Sparx to go without him, to which they both refused to do so. The opening soon collapsed, trapping the three within the crumbling Well of Souls. Spyro recalled the Chronicler's words as he utilized his Time Fury to freeze Cynder, Sparx, and himself inside a crystal, protecting them from harm as the mountain crumbled around them.The Legend of Spyro: Dawn of the Dragon  After three years of being trapped in the time crystal, Spyro and Cynder were broken free of their prison by a group of Grublins in the Well of Souls ruins. A pair of magical necklaces in the shape of snakes were attached to their necks while they laid unconscious, linking the two dragons together and preventing them from being able to move freely or away from each other. They were taken away to the Catacombs to be sacrificed to the Golem under Malefor's orders, and were then pinned by the chain to the floor of a large platform. Spyro and Cynder soon awakened, noticing that they were in a large chamber with Grublins at opposing sides anticipating the arrival of the Golem. They both attempted to leave, but found out they were both chained to the floor and were forced to fight waves of Grublins, until the large Golem arrived and scared the Grublins away.  Spyro and Cynder managed to break free of the floor, but remain tethered together, and they attempted to repel the Golem. When they failed to defeat it, Hunter, a cheetah warrior,\u00a0saved the two dragons by driving away the Golem, telling them that he had been sent by Ignitus to find them three years earlier, much to their disbelief. On their way to the Dragon City of Warfang where Ignitus was expecting their arrival, Hunter explained to Spyro and Cynder that the Dark Master, Malefor, had returned immediately after their disappearance and proceeded to shroud the world in darkness. While resting in the Enchanted Forest,\u00a0Spyro, Cynder, and Hunter were captured by Hunter's tribe, whose leader Chief Prowlus was distrustful of Dragons because of Malefor and Cynder when she was under the latter's control. After saving the village, Spyro volunteered to find a missing member of the cheetah tribe, and Cynder went along. Along the way, they encountered an old hermit, who Cynder didn't recognize. The Hermit insisted that he knew her, however recognizing her as the monstrous dragon she was from A New Beginning by her eyes, warning the black dragon of a fate she may very well suffer for being in service to Malefor, and that the Dark Master would find her for betraying him. Cynder became visibly upset over this, but Spyro reassured her by telling her not to listen to the Hermit. The two dragons soon departed, not wanting to hear anymore of the Hermit's words. When they arrived in Warfang, Cynder assisted in the city's defense. Shortly after the Golem's defeat, Spyro and Cynder were happily reunited with Ignitus and the other Dragon Guardians. Cynder then revealed to Ignitus the snake chains that binded her and Spyro together while claiming that it was the only reason she was there, but the Fire Guardian replied that it was irremovable. As Cynder appeared frantic that the chain could not be removed, Ignitus added that the chain was more than a hindrance, but a reminder of the bond Spyro and Cynder shared, and that their destinies were intertwined. Cynder and Spyro turned to each other, and shared what seemed to be a loving glance. After Malefor declared his plan to end the world and lets loose the Destroyer, Cynder came up with a plan to stop the immense Golem: destroying a dam holding back the water from a valley. With the Destroyer momentarily halted as a result, Spyro and Cynder tried to destroy it, only to discover that it was unstoppable, and the Destroyer was able to complete its circle needed to initiate the world's destruction. They decided the only other course of action was to face Malefor himself. Ignitus escorted the two dragons through the Belt of Fire, sacrificing himself in the process in order to get them through. Spyro became devastated and nearly went back into the fire to save Ignitus, transforming into Dark Spyro in his grief. However Cynder brought him back to his senses and comforted him in his despair, reminding him that he wasn't alone. While treking through the Burned Lands, Cynder felt uneasy as she didn't know if she wanted to face Malefor, deciding at first to give up, but Spyro reminded her that they mustn't, otherwise their journey would be all for nothing. She agreed on his behalf, claiming that she was only coming along because she wanted to get rid of the green chain that binded her and Spyro. Together, they ventured through to\u00a0the Floating Islands and finally arrived at Malefor's Lair. There, Cynder told Spyro that she was scared, but despite that, they both confronted Malefor after Spyro instructed her to stay close to him.  Inside, Malefor began the task of verbal corruption of Spyro, and stated that they have more similar qualities than just their color. Spyro immediately began to deny Malefor's words, and Cynder told Spyro to not listen to anything the evil dragon said. Malefor proceeded to release Spyro and Cynder from the magical chain linking them, and it is then that the Dark Master claimed that his influence over Cynder had not been extinguished, saying he had caused her to lead Spyro to him and that she tricked Spyro into resurrecting Malefor. Cynder at first denied his words, but gradually grew unsure over her actions in the past, allowing Malefor to once again unlock the darkness within her and Cynder back to his cause. As Dark Cynder, she began to attack Spyro, who only shrank away whilst Malefor continued to taunt him, claiming that there had been many purple dragons before them, and that their destiny was to destroy the world, not save it. He went on to say that, during each age, the purple dragon would call upon the Destroyer and the\u00a0Golems of the Deep to bring about \"the Great Cleansing\". Spyro refused to believe Malefor, while Dark Cynder continued to attack the young dragon relentlessly. After striking him several times, she growled at Spyro to fight back before demanding to know why he wouldn't do so. Disheartened, Spyro told Cynder that losing her had left him with\u00a0nothing to fight for. Upon hearing those words and discovering Spyro's feelings, Cynder broke free of Malefor's hold, reverting back to normal and lovingly replied to Spyro that there was always something. Enraged by the turn of events, Malefor chained Cynder back to Spyro, and declared that she would share his fate, before battling both dragons. During their first phase in the battle, the Destroyer managed to throw itself back into the volcano from whence it came, thus completing its circuit and beginning the destruction of their world. Spyro, Cynder, and Malefor continued to fight however, and the Dark Master was soon thrown down to the planet's heart, a giant purple crystal, by a joint Fury attack. Malefor declared that he cannot be defeated as he was eternal. However, dragon spirits resembling Ignitus emerged from the purple crystal upon these words, and proceeded to drag Malefor into the planet's heart and sealed him away, much to his dismay and the awe of Spyro and Cynder.  With Malefor gone, the chain around Spyro and Cynder's necks disappeared along with his dark magic, but Malefor's plan was still underway as the planet was breaking itself apart. Cynder apologized to Spyro for her past actions, and Spyro forgave her, telling her that she shouldn't be sorry now that it was all over. She then wondered if this was the end, as pieces of the world was breaking apart around them. With Ignitus's words in his head, Spyro realized what he had to do to save the world, and told Cynder to get out of the earth's core, not wanting to risk her life should he fail. Not wanting to lose Spyro again, Cynder refused to leave him, and as Spyro used his powers to try and prevent the world's end, she whispered to Spyro that she loved him. The world was then restored by Spyro's desperate endeavor as it was slowly being put back together, but it seemed that both Spyro and Cynder were killed as a result. After the credits, the Chronicler chose the spirit of Ignitus to be the next Chronicler of the new age. Before passing his mantle, the Chronicler informed Ignitus that though he has tried his best, but couldn't find any trace of Spyro in the book that details dragons who have died. As Ignitus began searching through the book to find where Spyro might be, the scene changes to the scenery of the Valley of Avalar. Glimpses of Spyro and Cynder were seen happily wheeling through the skies above the valley, but their fate is left open to interpretation.The Legend of Spyro 3D  According to the plot of the cancelled Spyro movie, Cynder was a powerful black dragon who was enslaved to the Dark Master by the red crystal she wore around her neck.\u00a0Relationships Spyro  After Spyro freed her from Malefor's grasp, Cynder felt responsible for the suffering she caused to everyone, including Spyro, to the point that she wanted to run away and discover herself. At first she saw Spyro as a friend whom she was willing to help but not necessarily work together with (likely coming from her guilt and fear that no one had forgiven her for her actions). She still showed genuine concern for him when he became Dark Spyro and trust in him when Spyro protected them with the time crystal. When they were chained to one another, Cynder claimed that she was only working with Spyro because they were stuck together. However as they spent more time together, she quickly realized that Spyro really cares and has a heartfelt understanding of her, and she started to care about him in the same way. Her friendship with Spyro eventually blossoms into true love as evident in the climax of Dawn of the Dragon. After defeating the Golem and reuniting with Ignitus, the two shared a loving glance for a moment. After Ignitus' death, Cynder starts speaking to Spyro in a soft tone of voice from there on out. Her feelings for Spyro became strong enough for her to break free from Malefor's control upon realizing that he has feelings for her. Spyro frequently reminds Cynder that she isn't responsible for her actions in the past even if the other denizens still remember her corrupted days and despise her, and the black dragon quickly takes on a more positive attitude. When Spyro was ready to use his power to restore the shattered world which would cost him his life, Cynder was given the choice to leave and save herself, but instead she chose to stay and admitted her love to Spyro before seemingly dying together with him. In the last scene of the trilogy, the two dragons were seen still together flying over the Valley of Avalar.Sparx  Spyro's companion and foster brother, Sparx, doesn't get along with Cynder very well, mostly due to Sparx still thinking that she is still evil, or might be jealous of Cynder garnering Spyro's attention rather than him. Cynder always takes a more sarcastic personality when \"conversing\" with Sparx and commented that she likes Hunter simply because he told Sparx that he 'was making too much noise'. The argument between the two seemed to have been diminished when Sparx and Cynder agreed to blow the Dam apart. When Sparx couldn't accompany Spyro and Cynder to the Burned Lands to face Malefor, the dragonfly forced Cynder to promise him look after Spyro, to which she did. It is assumed that Sparx is jealous of Cynder because Spyro is growing more close to her than he did with Sparx.Malefor  Corrupted into serving Malefor, Cynder was fully loyal to the Dark Master and entirely focused on bringing him back. After being released from his control, she wanted to fight against Malefor and tried to warn Gaul about not letting him return. She became determined to not become Malefor's slave again, and began wearing jewelry similar to the one she had worn when she was his servant as a form of facing her fear of him. However, she was still afraid of Malefor to a certain level, and during the final battle, he easily made her doubt herself and took control over her for a moment.Notes See also Trivia Camo  Camo (\u30ad\u30e3\u30e2 in Japanese) is a green plant dragon hybrid who is one of the playable Skylanders in the Skylanders series, first appearing in Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure.

Master Eon found himself at the butt end of this juicy-fruit joke when he visited Camo's idyllic island. While out for a stroll, Eon spotted a perfect melon waiting to be picked. But as he bent over the scrumptious speciment, it exploded, splattering the Portal Master's robe and alarmed old face. As he wiped away the sticky seeds, Eon noticed a pair of prying eyes nearby, clearly enjoying the scene. Eventually, Camo stepped forward and introduced himself. Eon soon invited him to be a Skylander - and, on his days off, the Portal Master's personal gardener.Abilities  As a result of being half plant and half dragon, Camo can grow fruits and vegatables that explode when they become ripe. His standard attacks involves firing bursts of solar energy from his mouth and conjuring vines of peppers from his tail that explode like firecrackers at enemies around them. He can also grow a ring of melons around him and send them flying and exploding at surrounding enemies. Generally, he is best suited for mid-to-long range. His Sun Burst is rapid fire and can knock away enemies. His vines do a great amount of damage, and can damage groups of enemies. He excels in mid and long range, but is somewhat weak in close range. The vines don't harm the enemy if it's too close, and the sun burst does only 13 damage (with the Searing Sun Blast upgrade). The Melon Fountain helps improve his close range skills and are useful for harming nearby enemies. You can choose the Melon Master upgrade path to improve his close range skills or Vine Virtuso for improve his Long Range skills.Console Stats  These are the starting and maximum statistics for this Skylander in the console version of the games.Power Stats  Warning: These stats are not used in any of the Skylander games.

Camo was going to look like Sun Dragon during the development of Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure, bearing the same attacks as well. His design still looked like Sun Dragon when The Begnning trailer was made, and changes to his character design was made very late during production, which resulted in Sun Dragon being left in the trailer despite his final form, Camo, being added in. While Sun Dragon himself is now a scrapped character design that never made it to the final line of playable characters for Spyro's Adventure, Camo became his successor.Trivia Characters  Characters throughout the Spyro franchise.Whirlwind (character)  Whirlwind  (\u30a6\u30a3\u30fc\u30eb\u30a6\u30a3\u30f3\u30c9 in Japanese) is a blue unicorn-dragon hybrid who is one of the playable Skylanders in the Skylanders series, first appearing in Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure. She has a winter counterpart called Polar Whirlwind. She also has a Series 3 counterpart called Horn Blast Whirlwind.Background Personality  Whirlwind is as brave as she is graceful. Her mood swings can be as changeable as the weather, but since becoming a Skylander, she has tried to keep her temper in check. She is strong-willed, wild and ferocious in the heat of battle. Deep down, Whirlwind is pure of heart, having held no grudge against the dragons and unicorns for shunning her and later on, protected the two species from attack.Biography  Whirlwind is an air dragon with unicorn ancestry \u2013 two species that could not be more opposite in nature, which made her never quite fit in with either group. Other dragons were envious of her beauty and grace, while her unicorn brethren shunned her for her unusual appearance and ability to fly. But Whirlwind found peace within the dark and stormy clouds, where she learned to harness the tempest power within her. Despite her turbulent youth, she remained pure of heart and was the first to defend both dragons and unicorns when the trolls began hunting them, unleashing her ferocity in a brilliant and powerful rainbow that could be seen throughout many regions of Skylands. From that day forward, evil-doers would quake when dark clouds brewed, and run from the rainbow that followed the storm.Story History  Born of both unicorn and dragon descent, Whirlwind often felt like an oddball outsider. Unicorns were unimpressed with her wings and dragons disliked the horn on her head. Shunned and seeking solace, Whirlwind retreated to the cover of storm clouds, where she learned to harness her tempest power. When a troublesome troupe of trolls came searching for unicorn tails and dragon scales, Whirlwind burst from her cover and unleashed a blinding rainbow to send them fleeing. From that day on, unicorns and dragons saw her in a new light. Seeing her purity of heart, Master Eon made her a Skylander. Today, nothing makes a troll tremble like a small, stormy cloud moving speedily towards him. It's also been stated that Whirlwind was the one who found Warnado and brought him to Master Eon, who made him a Skylander as soon as he stopped spinning. Years later, Whirlwind rescued the Frost Elves of Winter Keep from a curse of eternal midnight by enchanting a crystal horn called the Illuminator to grant eternal daylight to the elves. This not only helped break the curse, but also protected the Keep and gave the elves courage during their fight against potential attacks.Abilities  As a result of spending time within dark storm clouds, Whirlwind gained the ability to shoot rainbow energy from her horn at her opponents; which can also heal her allies if she gained her Soul Gem ability. She can also launch tempest clouds at her enemies with a clap of her wings. Being part dragon, Whirlwind has the ability to fly.Console Stats  These are the starting and maximum statistics for this Skylander in the console version of the games.Power Stats  Warning: These stats are not used in any of the Skylander games.

This iteration is the most prolific, having starred in 10 games (11 if one counts the Reignited Trilogy, and 13 if one counts it as three separate games), with one prominent featuring role and a couple of cameos in Crash Bandicoot games.Character Development and History Pre-History and Disruptor  Insomniac Games was founded in 1994 by Ted Price and named in 1995. Their first project, Disruptor, a first-person shooter, performed poorly, and Universal decided to contract them to create three games for Sony's PlayStation console. The poor sales disheartened the company and they had decided to do something different for their next project. Due to the changing demographic for the PlayStation, at the suggestion of Mark Cerny they decided to make a child-friendly game, with the success of games like Super Mario 64 making them decide upon a platformer as their genre of choice. It was at this point that the game was set in motion.Character Conception  Spyro as a concept was originally brought up by Insomniac in-house artist Craig Stitt, who had an interest in the fictional beasts. With the dragon decided upon, the developers then began conceptualizing names and potential designs for the character. The first suggested idea for Spyro was a green dragon initially named Pete, which may or may not be a reference to Disney's 1977 film, Pete's Dragon. The name couldn't be used due to this very reason. The second name decided upon was \"Pyro\" which is the Latin word for \"fire\". Deemed \"too mature\", the name was then altered to Spyro, which was the name that ultimately ended up sticking. After this the colour had to be finalised. As aforementioned, Spyro was initially depicted as green, but the developers didn't want him to blend into the grass he runs on. As such, a different colour for the dragon was a top priority. Thankfully, purple was chosen due to it contrasting well with greens and other colours commonly found in various environments, in addition to it being a unique colour that not many dragons used. With all of these details decided upon, Insomniac pushed forward into the design phase.Preliminary Character Designs  Insomniac brought on illustrator Charles Zembillas and tasked him with creating their dragon with the mentioned caveats in place. Various drawings were the first pass in an attempt to find the character that would eventually become Spyro. The creative direction was simple and basic: Draw a dragon that a video game can be developed around. It didn't really matter what the dragon looked like at this point. Decisions would come later based upon the sketches that were generated as Charles embarked upon the creative journey. An important factor in the concept design process was that the character would eventually be modeled digitally and animated in a 3D program, so technical considerations and the final medium were something that had to be kept in mind while the conceptual sketches were in progress.Design Refinement  The initial designs were rather large and bipedal in nature and features a rather crude, beaked dragon. After the first creative pass into the project, the producers came to an important decision: they decided that the dragon would be a character that appealed to 8-10 year olds. The character had to be cute, but at the same time, mischievous, bratty, unpredictable and something of an upstart. By the end of this pass, the character design that would become the basis for Spyro, that of a smaller, cuter, quadrupedal, snouted dragon, was defined.First Design (1998-2004)  The finalized design of Spyro would go on to be used from the original 1998 PlayStation game, all the way up to the the last GameBoy Advance title, Spyro Orange: The Cortex Conspiracy. In all of these games (visibility aside) Spyro appears to be a relatively close recreation of his original HD Render used for official artwork, featuring pointy eyebrows that seem to float to a degree, a round head, and a stockish body. It should be noted that for Spyro 2, Spyro's wings were adjusted to be longer and anatomically adjusted to be like bat wings, with \"fingers\" spoking out from the second joint.Second Design (2004-2005)  2004's Spyro: A Hero's Tail features a slightly more refined and expressive Spyro with a more compact and chubby body, smaller eyes, and smaller, rounder eyebrows. This same design would be carried over to Spyro: Shadow Legacy on the Nintendo DS. Funnily enough, despite these in-game alterations, the original HD Artwork is still used for promotional material, leading to some dissonance in the designs, at least for A Hero's Tail, which had more visible character models.Third Design (2018)  The triple remake, Spyro Reignited Trilogy, further refines the original design and with it, even includes brand-new 2D artwork to replace the original, greatly reducing the dissonance in models and art. This new design is much more fluid than the PS1 originals, while also appearing somewhat chubbier. The eyebrows are now properly attached to his face, but remain equally, if not more expressive than the originals.Personality  Spyro is known for being courageous, headstrong, eager and arrogant. He has an immutable sense of heroism, friendliness, and has a fiery personality. He has little concern for his own safety and can be irresponsible at times, being extremely curious and hardly ever cautious, which could get him into trouble. Spyro gets into lots of mischief and is known to be cocky, a trait that can lead to his downfall. As a young dragon in the first game, Spyro was mischievous, bratty and somewhat of an upstart. In Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage! and Spyro: Year of the Dragon, he became less cocky and more levelheaded. He has minimal interest in love, as he lost his chance with Elora in Ripto's Rage! and regarded the scene of Hunter falling in love with Bianca as \"a sad sight\". In Spyro: Enter the Dragonfly, his demeanor is significantly friendlier than that of his former and succeeding games, despite the limited number of cutscenes he's featured in. In Spyro: A Hero's Tail, he has become much more arrogant, and in more recent outings, has actually denied help to those who did not expressly indicate that they would award him. Despite this, he still saves the world, even if it is not willingly. In the Reignited Trilogy, Spyro's overall personality seems to be more mature and friendly compared to that of the original trilogy. His first scene with Elora is significantly more friendly, almost playful in tone. Alongside this, his interactions with the various dragons in the first game have been significantly lightened and Spyro's tone has been made softer.Abilities  Spyro's main attacks consist of charging his opponents with his horns and breathing fire at them. Because he is young, Spyro can't fly very well and can't breathe a continuous stream of fire; instead, he just spits arrow-shaped fire bursts and glides from place to place. As Spyro gets a little older, he learns how to use his wings as a shield, swim underwater, double jump, head dive, and breathe a stream of fire. In Ripto's Rage, and Year of the Dragon, there are powerup gates that temporarily give Spyro the ability to be invincible, fly, spit massive fire blasts (superflame), and charge extremely fast (supercharge). In Enter the Dragonfly, Spyro gains ice, electric, and bubble breaths. In A Hero's Tail, Spyro receives an additional water breath. He also gains the ability to cast various magic spells and the art of Dragon Kata in Shadow Legacy.Story Background  As told in an interview with Sparx\u00a0by the DNN (Dragon News Network), some details of Spyro's past are known. Sparx used to crawl around Spyro's egg when he was a larvae,\u00a0when there was peace in the Dragon Realms. Spyro is in fact an Artisan Dragon and may have been born in Stone Hill, as the ending cutscene are both set in Stone Hill.Dragon Realms  In Spyro the Dragon, Gnasty Gnorc attacked the Dragon Realms, freezing all the Dragons in crystal statues after being mocked and insulted by Lindar. Young Spyro and Sparx were the only ones that Gnasty's magic spell failed to affect, due to Spyro being smaller than the other dragons, and they set out across the Dragon Realms to free the resident Dragons and recover their treasure. After traveling through all five Dragon Realms (including Gnasty's Realm, the former Dragon Junkyard), freeing all 80 Dragons, recovering all 14,000 treasure, finding all 12 dragon eggs and disposing of all of Gnasty Gnorc's minions, Spyro and Sparx challenged, pursued and defeated Gnasty Gnorc.\u00a0 During an interview on Spyro's victory, the young dragon remarked that with every good battle, one needs a good adversary, and revealed that Gnasty Gnorc was a worthy opponent, despite having a misguided nature. This caused the Dragons to once again be trapped in crystal by an unseen character (presumably Gnasty Gnorc), and Spyro anticipated another adventure.\u00a0Sometime later, Spyro treated Sparx and himself to a vacation in\u00a0Dragon Shores, a theme park in the Dragon Realms operated by\u00a0Big Gnorcs\u00a0that managed to survive being flamed by Spyro and have since reformed.Avalar  In Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage!, during an extended period of rainy weather, Spyro and Sparx decided that they needed a vacation from the Dragon Realms. Noticing the portal to Dragon Shores and recalling they had not been there since defeating Gnasty Gnorc, Spyro and Sparx entered the portal to escape the bad weather. However, to their surprise, they arrived in a realm called Avalar because the Professor, Elora the Faun, Zoe the Fairy, and Hunter the Cheetah, had redirected the portal to bring them there instead. After a confusing moment, they encountered a dictator named Ripto, who was enraged that the residents had brought a dragon to Avalar. A brief tussle ensued, ending with Ripto's escape to Avalar's Summer Forest after his magical scepter fell into the maw of his dinosaur-like mount, Gulp. At Elora's request, Spyro and Sparx visited the realms of Avalar and recovered several Talismans, then pursued Ripto and fought against one of Ripto's minions, Crush. After Crush was crushed under a pile of rocks, Ripto and Gulp escaped to Autumn Plains, and Spyro and Sparx collected the rest of Avalar's talismans and pursued them. Spyro and Sparx caught up to Ripto, and fought against his mount, Gulp. Elora assisted by providing weapons to use against Gulp; Ripto fell off the battle arena after the battle, and Elora gave Spyro a place to rest while she returned to the Professor to check up on a portal to return Spyro and Sparx home. Spyro and Sparx decided to search for Elora and found themselves in Winter Tundra. There, they were met with news that Ripto was still alive and had locked Elora and the others out of the Tundra's palace. Once more, Spyro and Sparx were asked to travel through the local portals, and this time, to recover enough Orbs to challenge Ripto with. They both succeeded, and challenged Ripto to a duel. Zoe informed Spyro and Sparx that the Professor was working on new types of Orbs, and a fierce battle ensued, with both Spyro and Ripto using powers from the Orbs for attack. Ripto used one Orb to deploy a large, mechanized version of his steed Gulp. When Spyro destroyed that, Ripto used another Orb to transform the arena floor into lava, while creating a large mecha-bird to help finish Spyro and Sparx off. Spyro combated them in an aerial duel and defeated him, sending him to his (supposed) demise in the pool of lava. Spyro and Sparx were then sent back to Dragon Shores to begin their vacation. In the epilogue, it was revealed that Spyro visited Avalar sometime after his vacation, taking part in a hot tub party with The Chef, missing his chance with Elora while riding the Love Boat attraction, and was confronted by the black sheep of a herd of sheep.Forgotten Realms  In Spyro: Year of the Dragon, the Dragon Realms were celebrating an important event: the Year of the Dragon Festival. Every twelve years during this time, the Fairies deliver dragon eggs to the Dragon Realms, which will become the next generation of Dragons. In this year, the Fairies delivered 150 eggs to the Dragon Realms. The Dragons celebrated until they fell over from exhaustion and slept. While they were asleep, a mysterious rabbit girl named Bianca came with an army of Rhynocs to steal the dragon eggs. The Dragons woke up to notice their newest dragon egg brood was gone, and found Bianca about to steal the last remaining egg. Spyro, Sparx, and Hunter attempted to stop Bianca, but it was too late. She took the egg back through a wormhole to the realm where the Dragons once lived: the Forgotten Realms. Her master, known as the Sorceress, was beginning to lose her powers, due to the fact that the Dragons, the source of the world's magic, had migrated to the other side of the planet. She took the dragon eggs, planning to use them in a spell to give her eternal life and power. Since the older Dragons couldn't fit through the wormhole, they determined that only Spyro and Sparx were small enough to go to the Forgotten Realms and recover the 150 eggs. Hunter insisted that he went along, and after getting through the hole with difficulty, managed to help Spyro and Sparx. The Sorceress, along with Bianca, created monsters to fend off Spyro, but he defeated them. Along the way Spyro recruited four new allies, including Sheila the Kangaroo, Sgt. James Byrd the flying Penguin, Bentley the Yeti, and Agent 9, the Monkey in the Professor's service, all of whom were being held prisoner by Moneybags at the behest of the Sorceress. As Spyro and Sparx arrived in Midnight Mountain, Bianca realized how far her mistress would go to achieve power. She betrayed the Sorceress and went to Spyro's side, releasing Hunter from a trap he had fallen into and opening the door to the Sorceress's lair using the magic of 100 dragon eggs Spyro found. In a great battle, Spyro defeated the Sorceress; however, she was not killed. He had to recover 149 of the missing eggs, as well as 20,000 gems to fight her again in a secret region of the Forgotten Realms. After taking control of a spaceship, Spyro shot down the Sorceress once and for all, recovering the final egg and saving the Dragons from extinction.Fairy Realms Crisis  In Spyro: Season of Ice, after Spyro saved the dragon eggs from the clutches of the Sorceress, Spyro, Hunter, and Bianca returned from the Forgotten Realms and the three decided to take a vacation. Bianca was researching vacation spots in the Sorceress' library, but dropped her magic book. It was found by the lowly librarian Grendor. Seeing that it could make him incredibly smart, he found that desired spell and recited it. ...Unfortunately for him, he read the spell wrong, prompting him to grow another head with a pounding headache. Grendor then used his newfound magic to freeze all the fairies, and scatter them across the Fairy Realms. When Zoe found out, she quickly alerted Spyro in her letter. Spyro, Sparx, Hunter, and Bianca ascended up to the Fairy Realms to rescue all one hundred frozen fairies, including Zoe. As Spyro entered the first world, he found that the Fairy Realms had been infested by Rhynocs. Spyro was able to defeat all of the Rhynocs, and ultimately Grendor, and freed all of the fairies.Ripto's Return  In Spyro 2: Season of Flame, upon Spyro and Sparx's return from the Fairy Realms, Ripto returned for his ultimate revenge on the Dragons by scattering all of the Fireflies, the creatures whose magical properties give the Dragons their flame breath, all over the Dragon Realms. The Dragons' breaths became icy cold as Spyro and Sparx embarked on a quest to find the fireflies. Eventually, after saving all of the Fireflies, Spyro once again defeats Ripto, where he is banished by the Dragon Elders.Ripto's Revenge  Later, in Spyro: Enter the Dragonfly, Spyro and Sparx returned victorious after saving the Fireflies, prompting the Dragon Elders to begin celebrating the previously saved baby Dragons obtaining their Dragonflies. Unfortunately, Ripto escaped banishment and crashed the party, scattering 90 of the 151 Dragonflies across the Dragon Realms. Spyro and Sparx were tasked with tracking them all down. Eventually, Spyro and Sparx cleared all nine worlds attached to the Dragon Realms, and entered Ripto's portal with the combined magic of all of the Dragonflies. They entered Ripto's portal, and Ripto created a shield for himself that was resistant to fire. Spyro destroyed the shield and beat Ripto. But when Spyro thought he had Ripto on the verge of defeat, Ripto used a magic spell to grow twice his size. He then erected a flame barrier, making Spyro's flame breath useless. Spyro used his ice breath to bring down the barrier, and freeze Ripto. Finally, in one last act of desperation, Ripto used his magic to grow even bigger and incorporate pieces of Crush and Gulp into his body. Spyro easily brought down the monster with his electric breath. As Ripto was defeated, he cursed Spyro. Spyro discovered that Ripto's magic doesn't work properly because he was a dinosaur, and as such, their magical properties could not sustain the proper use of magic. This has lead to Ripto's hate of Dragons, and is the reason why he is so relentless on destroying them. The Dragon Elders banished Ripto once again, and the Dragon Realms were safe once more.The Stolen Laboratory  In Spyro: Attack of the Rhynocs, Ripto attempted another invasion, and was successfully able to take over the Professor's laboratory and drive Spyro and Sparx out. Spyro and Sparx were then tasked with traveling throughout the Realms to recover twelve 'Hearts', in order to open a passage back to the Professor's lab and confront Ripto again. Spyro and Sparx did so, and re-entered the lab and engaged in combat with Ripto once again. After they defeated him, Ripto was banished to Chateau Ripto, until he met with Dr. Neo Cortex, leading to the events of Spyro Orange: The Cortex Conspiracy.Hero Team Up  In Spyro Orange: The Cortex Conspiracy, Ripto teamed up with Dr. Neo Cortex to get rid of their foes, Spyro and Crash Bandicoot. They began by genetically modifying Ripto's \"Riptoc\" minions and disguising them as Crash and Spyro, leading the two protagonists to believe they are against each other. Crash and Spyro are alerted of their respective worlds' predicament and are sent to get rid of the disguised Riptocs. Crash and Spyro eventually encounter each other at Dragon Castles, believing each other to be a disguised Riptoc, but soon discover that they both have been tricked and decide to team up against Ripto and Cortex. Eventually, Spyro, Sparx, Crash, and Aku Aku defeated both Cortex and Ripto. The two heroes thank each other as the games end with a photo of Crash having Spyro in a friendly headlock.The Traitorous Elder  In Spyro: A Hero's Tail, Spyro discovered that the Dragon Realms were being plunged into darkness, this time by an evil Dragon Elder from long ago named Red. Spyro and Sparx teamed up with Hunter, Sgt. Byrd, and Blink the Mole in order to take down Red, and his unholy alliance of Gnorcs, along with Gnasty Gnorc and Ineptune. The five heroes battled their way through new homeworlds, and eventually defeated Red. However, Red escaped to his laboratory, and built a robot army by turning Gnorcs into robots with the unwilling help of the Professor. Finally, Spyro tracked down Red in his secret laboratory, where the evil dragon had become a robot himself because of Spyro's mistake. Spyro defeated him again, and the Professor shrank Red down to a very small size, so he wouldn't be able to attack the Dragon Realms again.The Shadow Realm  In Spyro: Shadow Legacy, Spyro and Sparx returned to the Dragon Realms to rest, only for the Realms to be in ruins by an unknown evil force. They soon discovered that the Sorcerer was attempting to seize control of the Dragon Realms using dark, shadowy mirrors of each Dragon Realm (called the Shadow Realms). Spyro learned the art of Dragon Kata and the use of magic from the Dragon Elders, and set out to rescue those the Sorcerer held captive, and defeat the Sorcerer himself. After clearing the Dragon Realms and Avalar of the shadowy influences, Spyro found Red in the Forgotten Worlds. After defeating him, it became apparent that Red was merely a pawn in the Sorcerer's plan to destroy the Dragon Realms. Red decided to change his ways and help Spyro defeat the Sorcerer. After Spyro made his way to the Sorcerer\u2019s lair, the Sorcerer revealed himself to be a dragon with four wings who, like Spyro, was purple as well. The two engaged in combat, and when Spyro won, the Sorcerer made his escape before he lost his power completely. Spyro returned to the Dragon Realms, and a parade was thrown in his honor, with Red being welcomed back into the Dragon Realms and made peace with the other Elders (except Titan). Afterwards, Spyro and his friends prepared themselves for the Sorcerer's next move.Relationships Sparx the Dragonfly  Not many words are necessary to describe the strong bond these two share; although it's rarely discussed verbally, the two have been best friends since the beginning. Sparx has protected Spyro from certain doom by enemies many times. Although, even though they are best friends, it is naturally a dragonfly's duty to protect young dragons in the Spyro world. Overall, you'll never see one without the other too far away.Hunter the Cheetah  Other than Sparx, Hunter was one of Spyro's best friends and greatest allies. The two seem to have a playful rivalry however, as they are almost always competing with one another in various activities that mostly involve racing, skateboarding, item collecting, etc. Spyro and Hunter first met when Spyro was transported to Glimmer, one of the worlds of Avalar, by the Professor. Hunter initially feared dragons, as they are usually described as large, powerful and ferocious creatures. This fear turned to surprise and disbelief when he first laid eyes on Spyro (possibly because of his small stature), to which he didn't take lightly. Since Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage, the two have been close friends. In Spyro: Year of the Dragon, Hunter began to display romantic feelings for Bianca, one of Spyro's former enemies. After Spyro defeated the Sorceress for the first time, the feelings were shown to be mutual and Spyro began to feel he lost his friend to \"The Plague of Love.\" Contrary to Spyro's beliefs, Hunter and Bianca were actually more concerned about his well-being during his battle with the Sorceress. So Spyro's friendship remained intact, and he even gained a new friend in the process.Elora  Spyro met Elora when he arrived in Glimmer, but they didn't formally introduce themselves until Spyro arrived in Summer Forest. Even when they first met, Elora had much faith in Spyro, and truly believed that he would be the one to end Ripto's tyranny in Avalar. She was very informative and kind, aiding him many times during his quest. When Spyro finally did defeat Ripto, she personally rewarded him with a kiss on the forehead. Although, Spyro seemed more surprised by this action than anything else, of course, being a \"young\" dragon, Spyro doesn't seem to be interested in things like romance or affection, which resulted in missing his chance with Elora in the epilogue of Ripto's Rage!. However, the two are still quite close.Ember  Ember, the pink female dragon, was quite close to Spyro. She constantly goes on about them loving each other, getting engaged, married, etc., but Spyro only ever viewed her as a friend. In one of the games, Shadow Legacy, Ember falls in love with an armadillo named Bandit. After this, she never 'flirts' with Spyro again, suggesting that she 'dumped' him for her new lover. Spyro seems to cope fine with this and they both see to each other as friends, and nothing closer.Gnasty Gnorc  During Gnasty's time of terror within the Dragon Realms, Spyro verbally admitted on numerous occasions that he had great disdain for the Gnorc king, and was determined to bring him down for turning all of the other dragons into crystal statues. After defeating his entire army of Gnorcs and finally confronting him, Gnasty chose to run during the battle, hinting that he may have feared Spyro.Trivia Slam Bam  Slam Bam (\u30b9\u30e9\u30e0\u30d0\u30e0 in Japanese) is a blue, four-armed yeti who is one of the playable Skylanders in the Skylanders series, first appearing in Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure. His Series 1 figure is available only in the Empire of Ice Adventure Pack, while his Series 2 figure is available in a single pack. Slam Bam also has a Legendary counterpart called Legendary Slam Bam, who is available in a Legendary pack with Legendary Ignitor and Legendary Jet-Vac. He also has a summer counterpart called Surfer Slam Bam who is only available on June 2013 on Skylanders: Lost Islands.Background Personality  Slam Bam can be a little frosty with folks he doesn't know, but soon thaws over time. Get on his bad side, however, and the polar pugilist will knock you out cold.Biography  Slam Bam lived alone on a floating glacier in a remote region of Skylands, where he spent his time ice surfing, eating snow cones, and his only friends were his many beautiful ice sculptures. It was a peaceful life, until Kaos destroyed the glacier, stranding Slam Bam on an iceberg that drifted through the skies for days. He awoke on Eon\u2019s Island, where he was taken in and trained to become a Skylander. Now his ice sculptures serve as a frosty prison for any evil-doer that gets in his way, and provide a key ingredient for delicious snow cones.Story History  This four-armed Yeti once lived a blissful, solitary life on a floating glacier. Here, he surfed the snowy slopes, studied ice sculptures and slurped his way through several squillion sensational snow cones. But an evil eye looked upon his every move. Kaos watched jealously for a glimpse of the secret ingredient that made Slam Bam's snow cones so sweet. When that didn't work, Kaos had the glacier destroyed. Little did Kaos know that it was a simple peppermint twist that gave the cones their extra kick. If only he'd thought asking. Now homeless, Slam Bam drifted on a small floating iceberg. After several days, he hit land, which luckily happened to be Master Eon's island. One serious conversation and several snow cones later, Eon suggested Slam Bam to become a Skylander. So he did.Skylanders: Gill Grunt and the Curse of the Fish Master  As the Skylanders finished repairing the walls of the Eternal Archives, Slam Bam was mentioned as one of the Skylanders present during its restoration. Gill Grunt was about to sing a song about their accomplishment, and Slam Bam quickly encased himself in a block of ice to muffle the noise of the Gillman's horrible singing.Skylanders: Eruptor Meets the Nightmare King  Slam Bam accompanied Eruptor and Grim Creeper as part of a mission to answer a call of help in The Frozen Seas. After saving an exedition camp from a group of Cyclopses lead by Bloodshot, he and the two other Skylanders came upon a tunnel that lead to what remained of a frozen kingdom. Upon seeing another clone of Eruptor frozen in ice, Master Eon appeared and explained that the kingdom belonged to King Nefarion, a wicked being who terrorized Skylands with the Mask of Power. The old Portal Master further explained that Eruptor Eruptor will eventually go back in time and become frozen in ice. Suddenly, strange changes began to occur, as Kaos had made his way to the past and began changing history. Before their eyes, Professor Splinters morphed into a servant of Kaos, affected by the time change, and Master Eon quickly teleported them to safety. Once at Eon's Citadel, Master Eon explained that Kaos went back in time using Nefarion's coin Bloodshot stole and was able to change the past. With Master Eon's help, Eruptor, Grim Creeper and Slam Bam were transported to the distant past when Nefarion reigned over Skylands to stop Kaos.Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure  Slam Bam was one of the Skylanders who assembled when Kaos and The Darkness approached Eon's Island. The yeti participated in the battle against Kaos and his minions along with some of the other Skylanders to protect the Core of Light. He was seen holding a Cyclops Chopper by the neck, before he, Gill Grunt, and Trigger Happy looked up in surprise at the sight of the Hydra appearing and destroying the Core. Slam Bam, along with the other Skylanders, were then banished from Skylands to Earth, where he was turned into a toy and awaited the new Portal Master to help him save Skylands.Abilities  Slam Bam has the ability to create ice sculptures to trap his enemies in and slow them down.

Although initially frightened and quite dizzy, over the passing years he grew to enjoy his whirling surroundings and learned many abilities and secrets of the Air Element. This led to Warnado becoming a powerful force and the only known turtle of his kind. Now, the only time he gets dizzy is when standing still.Story History  Warnado was supposed to be born a simple turtle and lead a humdrum life in a Skylands swamp. But in an exciting turn, while still a tiny, unassuming egg, he was plucked from his nest by an enchanted twister and sucked into the sky. Upon hatching, he found himself being hurled around the spinning centre of the twister with no apparent way out. After a while, Warnado became quite accustomed to his twirly, whirly surroundings. Being enchanted, the twister taught him Elemental secrets and magical wind tricks. By the time he hit adulthood, Warnado was as skilled as a senior Skylands sorcerer. And it was around this time that the next exceptional event took place: a storm of dark magic collided with the twister, knocking Warnado out onto solid ground for the first time in his life. But, to a turtle, who had spent his life inside a twister, solid ground didn't feel all that solid. In fact, it made Warnado a little seasick (or perhaps landsick). He found that the only way to avoid dizziness was to avoid standing still altogether - so he carried on spinning. As he twisted and turned across the Skylands terrain, Warnado was spotted by a creature in kind - Whirlwind. Whirlwind presented Warnado to Master Eon, who managed to convince the turtle to sit still for just long enough to make him his latest Skylander.Skylanders: Spyro versus the Mega Monsters  Warnado made a cameo as one of the Skylanders called by Master Eon to help restore the walls of the Eternal Archives after they were damaged by Kaos during his attempt to steal the Book of Power.Abilities  Having learned the ways of the Air element, Warnado has the ability to spin around in a whirling motion, knocking enemies away with his spiky shell. He can also summon tornadoes at a high velocity to help him fight off nearby opponents, and he can spin himself into a gray tornado to tear his way through enemies.Console Stats  These are the starting and maximum statistics for this Skylander in the console version of the games.Power Stats  Warning: These stats are not used in any of the Skylander games.

Like his Legend of Spyro counterpart, Dark Spyro is the dark alter-ego of Spyro. He also has a Mega Ram counterpart who appears in Skylanders: Swap Force.Background Personality  Dark Spyro is more wild, erratic, and darker than his normal counterpart, according to terms of gameplay and personality. Unlike his Legend of Spyro counterpart, Dark Spyro has full control over the darkness that resides within him, using this trait to fight evil. However he is always at risk of being consumed by the dark magic. This process worries his fellow Skylanders at times.Biography  Spyro is a rare magical dragon with the ability to harness the power of the elements of Skylands, though he prefers to master fire. However, this innate ability with elemental powers also leaves him vulnerable to the influence of darker magic. When The Darkness is nearby, Spyro can channel its energy and combine its power with his own, becoming Dark Spyro. Over the years, he has learned to focus and control his power, using this dark magic to fight the forces of evil.Story History  Spyro has some sensational skills. Unlike the other Skylanders, he can harness the energy of every element, but still prefers his original favorite - Fire. But there is a sinister side to Spyro's ability. Master Eon observed this first-hand when The Darkness attempted to corrupt the Core of Light. Spyro began to shudder and shake. His purple skin seemed to flush and flare as dark magic flowed through him like lightning. Only Master Eon's speedily cast spells saved Spyro from a foul fate. With time, and Eon's tutelage, Spyro has learned to master this dark magic know-how. And when he harnessed energy, he transformed into Dark Spyro! However, only Spyro's brave heart and careful control prevent him from being consumed by darkness.Abilities  In the console versions, Dark Spyro's attack methods are similar to his normal counterpart's, but his fire attacks are more tainted with purple energy, having been infused with the energies from The Darkness. His abilites are also the same as normal Spyro's. In the 3DS version of Skylanders, Regular Dark Spyro attacks his enemies differently by striking them in a flurry of tail, claws, and lightning breath, even blasts his foes with bursts of pure dark energy, however the mega ram counterpart has the same attacks as the all other versions of Spyro.Console Stats  These are the starting and maximum statistics for this Skylander in the console version of the games.Power Stats  Warning: These stats are not used in any of the Skylander games.

She also has a Legendary counterpart called Legendary Stealth Elf, who is a Toys R Us exclusive. Stealth Elf has a Ninja counterpart who is available in the console Starter Pack of Skylanders: Swap Force.Background Personality  Stealth Elf, like all elves, adores nature. She is considered a guardian protector of the forests and of Skylands. She may be a highly trained ninja, but sometimes Stealth Elf is known to have a sense of a rampaging Cyclops Mammoth.\u00a0Like all Life Skylanders, Stealth Elf prefers to keep her feet on the ground.Biography  As a small child, Stealth Elf awoke one morning inside the hollow of an old tree with no memory of how she got there. She was taken in by an unusually stealthy, ninja-like tree creature in the deep forest. Under his tutelage, she has spent the majority of her life training in the art of stealth fighting. After completing her training, Stealth Elf became a Skylander, putting her skills in good use while also trying to uncover the mystery behind her origins.Story History  Stealth Elf can't remember much about her family or from whence she came. But she is the only Skylander who can skewer and slice through a platoon of ne'er-do-wells before slipping away unseen. Stealth Elf's earliest memory is of waking with a start and screech, following a nightmarish dream of stampeding sheep. But when she awoke there were no woolly warriors in sight - only woodland and a complete memory blank. With a sniffle and a sigh, she picked herself up and set off in search of answers. After several days, she stumbled on a gnarled, stumpy-looking creature with the lightning moves of a ninja master. It turned out the creature was the guardian of the forest and trained in the ancient art of stealth. Sensing the young elf's skill for sneaking, the guardian immediately made her his apprentice. Sure enough, Stealth Elf was a natural and soon, ran rings around her increasingly ragged sensei. Master Eon was invited for a look, and was knocked out by her nifty ninja skills. She was made a Skylander on the spot and served not only guardian of the forests, but protector of the world.Skylanders: Spyro versus The Mega Monsters  After investigating Stinky Swamp, Stealth Elf returned to Eon's Citadel to inform the veteran Portal Master of a terrible monster lurking within the swamp. She was then accompanied by Spyro to search out this monster, saving a Mabu named Snuckles from Chompies along the way. The Mabu explained that he was looking for a friend, Nort, who went missing in the swamp. The two Skylanders were then attacked by an unusually giant titchy toad, whose toxic saliva caused Spyro and Stealth Elf to fall asleep while Snuckles was nearly eaten and torn apart by the titchy toad. The Mabu was saved by the timely arrival of Kaos, who claimed that he was turning over a new leaf by defeating evil doers and also having saved Nort from the toad. Stealth Elf was woken up by Spyro in time to hear Kaos renouncing his evil ways before he departed, leaving Spyro and Stealth Elf in disbelief. As news of Kaos saving the residents of Skylands from mega-sized creatures were made known, Stealth Elf stayed behind while Jet-Vac, Drill Sergeant, and Spyro were instructed to go to the Desert of Columns to help a Molekin named Diggs escape from a mega-sized monster. \u00a0When the Skylanders returned, Stealth Elf accompanied Spyro, Trigger Happy, and Drill Sergeant to help the Warrior Librarians of the Eternal Archives protect the Archives from being taken. During a battle against mega-sized Chompies, Kaos appeared and revealed his true intentions of him claiming to be a hero: he wanted to test his magic staff on a few creatures (growing them into a giant size), trick people into thinking he was saving them just so he could attack the Archive and blackmail its curator, Wiggleworth, into giving the evil Portal Master a forbidden book within the Archives. During the struggle against Kaos and the giant Chompies, Stealth Elf stole Kaos's staff and used its magic to supersize Spyro to allow him to battle the mega-sized Chompies. However, Kaos stole back his staff and shrunk Stealth Elf down to the size of an ant. As revenge, the tiny elf stabbed one of her daggers into Kaos's ankle like a splinter, causing the evil Portal Master to painfully drop his staff and allowing Drill Sergeant the chance to destroy it, returning Spyro and Stealth Elf back to their normal size. The Skylanders soon defeated the giant Chompies and successfully drove away Kaos from the Eternal Archives.Skylanders: Giants  Stealth Elf, along with Spyro, Gill Grunt, Stump Smash, and Eruptor, are still frozen as toys on Earth and were put in a toy display inside a toy store called Super Toy Planet. They were few of the Skylanders who witnessed Kaos breaking free of his statue-like form due to his power as a Portal Master. When Kaos noticed the frozen Skylanders and taunted them, Stealth Elf, along with the Skylanders, agreed with Stump Smash when the tree creature angrily declared that if he could move, he'd 'dropping the hammer' on Kaos right there and then. Afterwards, the present Skylanders could do nothing but watch as Kaos returned to Skylands with the use of a nearby Portal of Power.Relationships Spyro  Spyro is a fellow Skylander and ally to Stealth Elf, being in good terms with one another on most occasions.\u00a0Drill Sergeant  Although Stealth Elf considers Drill Sergeant as an ally, she gets irritated by the Arkeyan bulldozer calling her 'sir' due to Drill Sergeant's original programming to obey orders.Abilities  Stealth Elf is extremely agile, able to skewer and slash swiftly at her enemies with her daggers and swords, and take down her foes by surprise. She can literally disappear, and at exactly the same time, create a decoy version of herself. As she does so, Stealth Elf uses invisible stealth to attack the enemies when they are attacking her decoy. Her Forest Ninja path can also create replica scarecrows of herself wielding scythes to attack other advancing enemies. Her Pook Blade Saint path Elf Jitsu can release Poison Spores as a combo, she can also release a Blade Flurry as another combo.Console Stats  These are the starting and maximum statistics for this Skylander in the console version of the games.Power Stats  Warning: These stats are not used in any of the Skylander games.

He is available exclusively in the Darklight Crypt Adventure Pack.Background Personality  Ghost Roaster is known for his relentless, undying appetite for ghosts (particularly evil ghosts). However, being a chef, he is good in the kitchen for making delicious recipes.Biography  There was a time when Ghost Roaster was neither a ghost nor a roaster. Instead he was a chef living in a village high in the mountains. One day, while clipping wool from a sheep to use in a recipe, he accidentally fell into the Valley of the Undead and transformed into a ghost-eating ghoul! After eating an entire spectral village, its Ethereal Ruler chained Ghost Roaster to a spiked ball as punishment. Its rattle can be heard as he wanders the night, warning nearby spirits. When Master Eon eventually heard of his predicament, he figured even a ghost eater could be useful. So he made Ghost Roaster a Skylander... after he promised to eat only evil ghosts.Story History  Ghost Roaster absolutely loved food. From spectre soup to phantasm fries, he regarded any undead recipe with relish (and sometimes tops them with relish too). But Ghost Roaster wasn't always a gobbling soul; he was once a simple chef called Olav. Olav lived in a mountain-top village and was said to serve the best sheep-wool stew in all of Skylands (not that anyone had ever tried it anywhere else there). One day, when Olav was wandering the hills searching for sheep (or, more specifically, their wool), he slipped down the mountain side. Luckily he bounced on his behind and made a soft landing in the valley below. Unluckily his bottom was badly bruised. More unluckily still, he had entered the Valley of the Undead, and his days as a friendly foodie were over. A famished Olav, or 'Ghost Roaster' as he decided to call himself, went in immediate search for a bite to eat. Luckily, a nearby ghost town was spilling over with puffy white spooks - which Ghostie promptly treated as a paranormal all-you-can-eat buffet. Understandably, the town's ethereal ruler was a little irritated to find its inhabitants completely devoured. So, as punishment, he chained Ghost Roaster to a rattling spiked ball to warn any wandering spirits. Taking pity on the skeletal ghoul, Master Eon made Ghost Roaster a Skylander - but only after he swore not to turn Hex into a hamburger.Abilities  Being a ghoul, Ghost Roaster can turn intangible to avoid enemy attacks, but it drains his health in the process. He can also turn into a flaming and speeding skull, and strike his enemies using the spiked ball or spike of his chain.Console Stats  These are the starting and maximum statistics for this Skylander in the console version of the games.Power Stats  Warning: These stats are not used in any of the Skylander games.

That is, until his underwater utopia was invaded by a legion of oil-drilling trolls that scattered his people to the wind. Armed with a powerful mace that had been handed down from one king to the next for generations, Wham-Shell defeated the greedy trolls and drove them away. Soon after, he joined the Skylanders to help defend against this type of atrocity ever happening again.Story History  Skylands sea shanties tell of a crustacean king called Roland, who ruled over beautiful bubble buildings and priceless pearl pastures. Good King Roland had ruled peacefully throughout his reign, but tragedy was about to strike. The trolls had arrived. They began by building rigs and platforms to pump oil from the ocean bottom. Soon, they became even greeder and sent their submarines to invade this undersea realm. Roland's son, Wham-Shell, was sent into a spluttering rage. He collected the magical mace of the giant clam kings and swam to the surface to shatter the trolls' equipment into a million smithereens. Wham-Shell's successful skirmish soon reached the ears of Master Eon. Right there and then, he made the crafty crustacean a Skylander and king protector of all the seas.Skylanders: Gill \u00a0Grunt and the Curse of the Fish Master  Wham-Shell and Zap were called by Master Eon to assist Gill Grunt when the Gillman was about to eaten alive by a rampaging Cloud Kraken. They both saved Gill Grunt and attempted to stop the Cloud Kraken, only to make the beast turn its blind fury upon a pirate ship called the Fearsome Fang and its crew. The ship's captain, Grimslobber, mysteriously scared off the Cloud Kraken without having to do a thing, confusing Gill Grunt, Zap, and Wham-Shell.  When Grimslobber called Gill Grunt names to try and fick a fight, Wham-Shell was the first to defend his fellow Skylander before Zap, but was calmed down by Gill Grunt as they didn't want any trouble with the captain and his band of pirates. Zap then unintentionally asked them about a treasure one of the pirates accidentally blurted out, prompting the seemingly friendly Grimslobber to surround the Water Skylanders with his crew and attack them. Gill Grunt, Zap, and Wham-Shell narrowly escaped the Fearsome Fang and dove into the safety of the sea, leaving Grimslobber to swear vengeance. The Water Skylanders then hear from Spyro that Kaos was after the Water Fragment as well, and Gill Grunt quickly lead his fellow Water Skylanders to the Kingdom of the Merpeople, knowing that the merpeople, who have swam the waters for thousands of years, would know the location of the fragment. The Skylanders discovered the kingdom was deserted, with only the elderly, children, King Scalebeard, Prince Aquan, and Princess Finella still within the kingdom's barrier. Suddenly Prince Aquan and Princess Finella fell under a strange trance and swam out of the kingdom along with several other merfolk, and the Skylanders followed them in hot pursuit to see where they were going. With the help of Zap's speed, the Water Skylanders were able to keep up with the merfolk, avoiding a swarm of electro-jellies along the way. During the chase, Wham-Shell mysteriously had fallen under a spell and turned on Gill Grunt and Zap, capturing Zap after knocking the water dragon nearly unconscious with his starfish bullets and dragging him into a cave where the hypnotized merfolk went into. The crustacean prince was later revealed to be under the control of Captain Grimslobber, who was using the Fish Master's Crown to force the merfolk into digging out the gem-eels and hauling them to the surface so that could become rich. Gill Grunt was able to free himself from the curse with the help of Zap, causing Grimslobber to lose control over a portion of the merpeople and Wham-Shell. During the confusion, Wham-Shell was freed from the curse and released the gem-eels, causing Grimslobber loses his hold on the Crown, and it shattered on the ocean floor into two pieces, fully freeing the merfolk. As the pirate captain made a hasty retreat, Wham-Shell followed after Gill Grunt back onto the\u00a0deck of the Fearsome Fang along with Zap. With the help of the freed merfolk, and even Spyro, the Water Skylanders bested Grimslobber and his pirate crew.  Grimslobber pulled out a pistol and attempted to kill Gill Grunt, when the captain was knocked overboard and eaten alive by the Cloud Kraken. Kaos then revealed his presence, having recovered the pieces of the broken Fish Master's Crown that supposedly contained the Water fragment. After taunting the Skylanders, the evil Portal Master made his leave but not before sinking the Fearsome Fang, causing Spyro, Gill Grunt, Zap, and Wham-Shell to quickly escape off of Grimslobber's sinking ship via portal. Back at the Eternal Archives, it seemed the Skylanders had failed their mission to retrieve the Water fragment, when Gill Grunt checked Grimslobber's satchel he brought back with him and held a dirty rag the captain had used to wrap the Fish Master's Crown. The rag soon revealed itself to be the Water Fragment, making the Skylanders realize that Kaos had stolen nothing more than a worthless broken crown. Knowing that Kaos would be after the next fragment to the Mask of Power, the Skylanders would be ready for him...Abilities  Using his mace, which is called the Troll Cracker (originally called the Claw Cracker due to him defeating the trolls), Wham-Shell can release an electricity discharged from mace's spiked tip. He can also strike his enemies with his mace and release pulses of water from it.Console Stats  These are the starting and maximum statistics for this Skylander in the console version of the games.Power Stats  Warning: These stats are not used in any of the Skylander games.

He is a rare purple dragon that is destined to bring peace to the Realms that is his home.Personality  Spyro is young and compassionate for others and is always willing to help them no matter what happens. He doesn't ask for rewards and is just happy to be a big help to those in danger. He is adventurous, curious about his past and eager to shape his future. In spite of showing recklessness of an adolescent at times, Spyro is slowly growing into the role of a leader of a proud species. He also cares a great deal about those that he considers close friends, such as Cynder and Ignitus. Unlike\u00a0his counterpart from the original series, Spyro is much more mature and serious, lacking his cockiness and arrogance and showed more willingness to correct his mistakes in the past. He is very intelligent, as he is able to understand Volteer's fast intellect and wide use of vocabulary. Having lived the first years of his life thinking he's a Dragonfly, Spyro is a little na\u00efve about the ways of the world, but is eager to learn and grow. He is also very courageous, as at one point, he saved Cynder from Malefor's control while Convexity was collapsing even though she was his enemy. Spyro has a rather ambiguous view of destiny. At first, he only agreed to fight against Malefor because he was informed about his role as the Purple Dragon. However, when the Chronicler announced the dark fates of everyone Spyro knew after Malefor's return, Spyro strongly refused to accept them and disobeyed the Chronicler's advice to hide and fight later (which, ironically, was what allowed Malefor to return and cause those fates), stating that he must forge his own path. He also refused to believe in Malefor's view of the Purple Dragon's destiny.Abilities  Normally, dragons can only wield and master a single element. Spyro, being a rare purple dragon, can wield and master several elements: Fire, Ice, Earth, and Electricity, as well as Time. Like all purple dragons, he can also control many abilities that others cannot. Namely, he can impulsively master the element of Aether, the signature breath ability of the Purple Dragon, and he once had control over Dragon Time (to a certain extent). However, that power was seemingly exhausted when Spyro used Dragon Time to encase himself, Sparx and Cynder inside a crystal to protect them from harm, as he has not been seen using it again. Having grown up in the Swamp, Spyro learned to defend himself using melee combat by means of his horns, tail, and paws. After receiving formal training from Ignitus, his skill in this area greatly improves, allowing him to defeat numerous Ape warriors without having to use his elemental abilities. Since he is still a rather young dragon (and does not possess the full physical capabilities of the larger adult dragons), Spyro prefers to use his size and agility to his advantage, outmaneuvering his more physically powerful opponents and striking whenever he sees the opportunity. His skills in melee combat were enough to allow him to hold his own and deal a significant amount of damage to Gaul, an incredibly powerful fighter whose abilities were augmented by the use of Gems\u00a0and the Well of Souls, despite having his elemental abilities drained and being physically weakened. In combat, he uses the tactic of knocking his opponents into the air, where he can use his superior aerial mobility to attack his opponent without fear of outside interference or retaliation. While in the air, he can ram airborne opponents into their allies to inflict more widespread damage. Like all dragons, Spyro is also able to fly. Originally, his skill with this ability was rather limited, as he would only use it for long journeys (in addition to showing some difficulty in landing properly) and appeared unable to use it to travel shorter distances. By Dawn of the Dragon, however, he has gained much greater proficiency in flying, being able to do so whenever he wishes, and can do so over any distance for a prolonged period of time. Despite this, his flight is still somewhat limited, as he depends upon the wind currents to allow him to reach greater altitudes when flying over shorter distances and may lose altitude in the absence of such currents.Story The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning  Spyro is a rare purple dragon born once every ten generations, prophesized to bring hope to the world. During Spyro's incubation, the Dragon Temple was attacked by the forces of the Dark Master, who was intent on destroying all the dragon eggs to prevent Spyro's birth. Ignitus, the Dragon Guardian of Fire, rescued the purple dragon's egg, and left it to drift down a nearby river, hoping for the best. Spyro's egg drifted down the river, which brought it to a distant swamp, and was soon discovered by a kindhearted pair of dragonflies, Nina and Flash. Upon hatching, the dragonflies were frightened at first, but were amazed and astonished by the newborn dragon. Knowing the swamp to be a very dangerous place, the dragonflies decided to adopt and raise Spyro as one of their own alongside Sparx, a young dragonfly who was born the same day. Many years passed since Spyro's birth. Since then, Spyro grew up unaware of his heritage, believing he is a dragonfly himself who just happens to be big and purple. On one fateful day when Spyro and Sparx were playing hide 'n' seek, a group of Apes attacked the duo and Sparx was captured in the process. Spyro disposed most of the group when Sparx gave the leader a sarcastic insult. The leader didn't take the insult very well and was about to kill Sparx. Spyro, furious, unconsciously used his Fire breath on the leader, who promptly retreated report back to someone called Cynder. Spyro dealt with the remaining Apes and freed Sparx from his 'lantern' cage. Upon returning home, he was told by his foster parents, Flash and Nina, that he was not a dragonfly, but a stranger from a distant, war-torn land. Spyro decided to leave the Swamp in search of his true home. Sparx, though reluctant at first, decided to follow along. Spyro was pursued by hostile forces, but eventually came into contact with a distraught Ignitus, who although pleased that Spyro was alive, feared that with the Dragon Temple under occupation by the Apes, led by a large black dragon named Cynder, their war was already lost. Spyro convinced Ignitus to lead him to the Temple, and was able to drive Cynder's forces out, after which Ignitus told Spyro more about their war against the Dark Armies. The Fire Guardian offered Spyro some training in the art of Fire, and then sent Spyro off to rescue three other Dragon Guardians from Cynder's forces. First, he flew to Dante's Freezer to find Volteer, the Electric Guardian Dragon. There, he faced the Ice King, and saved Volteer.  When Spyro and Volteer returned to the Temple, Volteer trained Spyro the art of electricity and explained to Ignitus that he lost some of his electric powers inside a crystal Cynder stored. Ignitus expected that Cynder may be planning to do something with the Guardians' powers, but he doesn't know what for, so Ignitus sent Spyro to Tall Plains, home of the Attlawa tribe, to find Cyril, the Ice Guardian Dragon. When Spyro was near the shrine where Cyril was held, he and Sparx witnessed Cynder fly off without noticing them and they continue their way to the shrine. Once there, the God of the Shrine, the Stone Sentinel, awakened and engaged Spyro in battle, which the purple dragon emerged victorious. After Spyro Cyril returned to the Temple with Cyril, he taught Spyro the secrets of the Ice element and discussed with the other Guardians more about Cynder's possible plans. Ignitus hypothesized that Cynder was trying to gain all the Guardians' elemental powers to open a portal that must never be opened. Spyro questioned Ignitus of what was he talking about, but Ignitus told him that doesn't concern him now and sent Spyro to Munitions Forge, where Terrador, the Earth Guardian Dragon, was held. Atop of the volcano, of Boyzitbig, where Terrador was imprisoned, Spyro engaged in battle with the Conductor and his locomotion, Steam. After the Conductor's defeat, the explosion of Steam released Terrador from his prison. When Spyro was ready to leave with Terrador, Cynder appeared and chased Spyro throughout Munitions Forge as the volcano erupted around them. Cynder was about to catch Spyro, but Ignitus intervened and fought with the black dragon, becoming captured in the process. Spyro tried to help Ignitus, but Terrador stopped him and told Spyro that he wasn't ready to take on Cynder. Spyro felt guilty and ashamed that he let Ignitus down and was frightened to face Cynder. Terrador told him that there's no shame for all warriors to have fear, and trained Spyro how to master the element of earth and his own fear.  After Spyro's training, Terrador explained to Spyro, Volteer, and Cyril about Cynder's lair, possibly where she took Ignitus. Spyro flew to Cynder's lair and found Ignitus confined with his powers being draining inside a crystal. Cynder stopped Spyro from destroying the crystal, and after Spyro fought her, she escaped with it. While fighting with the villain, Spyro noticed that there was something familiar with Cynder, and Ignitus told him the truth. Cynder was actually born from the same brood of eggs as Spyro, but she was taken by the Dark Master's forces and corrupted by his poisonous powers, becoming his tool of destruction. The Dark Master was using Cynder to gain the Guardians' powers so she could unlock the portal, which served as his prison, as only a dragon born on the Year of the Dragon can open it. As the vortex to the world of Convexity opened, Ignitus feared that they were too late, but Spyro refused to give up and followed Cynder through the portal. When Spyro caught up with Cynder, she had already put the final crystal inside the portal, allowing the Dark Master a means of escape, and was ready to face Spyro in a final showdown. Eventually, Spyro used all of his power in a final attack to defeat Cynder, freeing her from the Dark Master's influence and returning her to her true form: a young dragon the same size and age as Spyro. The portal to the Dark Master's prison opened, but suddenly began to pull the three towards it. Sparx insisted on making a quick exit, but Spyro declared he will not leave Cynder behind with the Dark Master; though barely, Spyro was able to grab Cynder and escaped safely. Back at the Dragon Temple, the Guardians congratulated Spyro for succeeding in rescuing them all, before Sparx ranted on how he didn't get any credit for the things he had done helping the dragons. Though victorious, the battle cost Spyro much of his own strength and powers, and it would take time for his powers to return. While celebrating their victory, Spyro emerged from the temple to one of the balconies and gazed up to the stars before being joined by Cynder. They both knew that the Dark Master was still alive somewhere; their troubles were far from over.The Legend of Spyro: The Eternal Night  Weeks had passed since Spyro freed Cynder from the Dark Master's control and brought her back to the Dragon Temple. During that time period, he began to having recurring nightmares, one of them of his final battle against Cynder in Convexity, until he was woken up by Sparx one night. When Sparx noted he could finally sleep due to Cynder leaving the temple, Spyro followed after her. He found Cynder in the jungle surrounding the Dragon Temple and caught up to her; he asked her to stay, stating no one blames her for what happened. Despite Spyro's plea, Cynder left, saying she didn't want to cause pain and suffering to anyone, especially Spyro. When Spyro was about to chase Cynder, he collapsed and found himself in a dream void. A mysterious voice spoke to him in his dream, helping Spyro regain his Fire element and showing him a vision of a large tree.  After Spyro woke up, an Ape army attacked the Temple. Once Spyro repelled the attack, Ignitus tried to locate Cynder, but instead found a vision of Spyro at the base of a great tree. Spyro claimed that he kept seeing haunting visions of a mountain draped in shadow and darkness beneath the two moons. Terrador realized that that mountain was the Mountain of Malefor. Spyro also claimed that a voice, called the Chronicler, came to his dream and showed him that tree. The Guardians were shocked, and Ignitus told Spyro that the Chronicler is an ancient dragon of immeasurable wisdom and was often interwoven with tales of doom. The Guardians became increasingly worried about the Celestial Moons coming into an eclipse and felt that they were no longer safe at the Temple. While he remained behind to search for Cynder, Ignitus sent Volteer and Cyril to the mainlands to learn what news they could, and sent Terrador to the Shattered Vale to warn everyone residing there about the darkness spreading from the mountain. Spyro was assigned to go to the Ancient Grove to seek out the tree that he saw in his dream. While searching, he was summoned into a dream by the Chronicler again to regain his Ice abilities and showed Spyro a vision of a terrible king-like Ape, leading a huge army of Apes to the Mountain of Malefor, shouting, \"...The Well of Souls!\", another name of the mountain. After Spyro woke up, he eventually found the great tree, but it later turned out to be a monster called Arborick and Spyro defeated it. Afterwards, a group of Skavengers, led by a captain named Skabb, appeared and wanted Arborick for \"entertainment\" in a fighting arena, but that changed when the Pirates wanted Spyro to \"cooperate\", so they knocked him unconscious. Spyro later awoke, finding himself in a cell on the ship of Fellmuth Arena. Battle after battle, Spyro defeated many challenges that the Skavengers threw at him. Shortly after defeating his first opponent, the Blundertails, Spyro was summoned yet again by the Chronicler who helped the young dragon regain his Earth powers and told him more about the Well of Souls and the Night of Eternal Darkness. Before Spyro awakened, the Chronicler instructed Spyro to find him in the Celestial Caves of the White Isle. After another arena battle, Spyro received a message from another prisoner called Hunter of Avalar, saying that he had become Spyro's ally. Later on, Spyro was forced to fight Cynder in a final match, but she told him about her plan for escape. The fight was cut short when an Ape army attacked and captured Cynder. With Skavengers on their ships in chaos, Spyro managed to defeat Skabb, and escaped.  After he escaped from the Skavengers, the Chronicler summoned Spyro in his dream for the final time to regain the power of Electricity and showed him a vision of Cynder in chains, brought before the Ape King she called by the name of Gaul. When he arrived at the White Isle, Spyro overcame tough challenges of his elemental skills and he eventually found the Chronicler, who told him about Gaul, an Ape King who led the raid at the Temple at the night of Spyro's birth and stole Cynder's egg. Spyro then wanted to know what would happen to Cynder and learned more about her past. Upon discovering that Cynder will return to the Dark Master's side upon his return, Spyro refused to believe it. The Chronicler told Spyro about Malefor, the Dark Master. According to him, Malefor was the first purple dragon to exist; his raw power allowed him to master practically every elemental power. When his growth failed to stop, he was exiled by the Dragon Elders, but after that, he built an army of Apes and taught them how to use the gems; the dragon's lifeforce. Malefor's sheer wage of his malice split the earth and created the Well of Souls; where the Apes had established, in effort to revive Malefor at the Night of Eternal Darkness. The Chronicler wanted Spyro to hide from the Apes until a later time, but Spyro insisted on going to Cynder's aid. When he got to the mountain with Sparx and confronted Gaul within the core of the Well of Souls, the Ape King zapped Spyro with his staff's power, rendering him weak and drained him of his elemental powers. He then ordered Cynder to attack the weakened Spyro. When she attacked Gaul instead, he knocked her out and challenged Spyro himself. During the fight, the lunar alignment occurred, and the evil energy it generated channeled through Spyro, transforming him into Dark Spyro. Possessed by the influence of Dark Aether, Spyro used his immense power to turn the Ape King into stone, ultimately killing Gaul before leaping back into the lunar beam of energy. Cynder awoke, and upon seeing Spyro possessed by evil and the power of the Lunar Alignment, she knocked Spyro out of the beam, freeing him.  Spyro apologized for being unable to control himself, but was forgiven by Cynder, who reassured him that he was with friends.\u00a0However, Spyro's battle with Gaul caused the mountain to begin collapsing around them. Cynder spotted an opening big enough for all three of them to escape, but Spyro was left weakened from his battle with Gaul and urged Cynder and Sparx to go without him, though they both refused to leave Spyro. The opening soon became blocked off, trapping the three within the collapsing Well of Souls. Spyro recalled the Chronicler's words, and he utilized his Time Fury to freeze Cynder, Sparx, and himself inside a crystal, protecting them from harm as the mountain crumbled around them. After the credits, the crystal that contained Spyro, Cynder, and Sparx was seen within the ruins of the Mountain of Malefor. As the three companions were frozen in time, the Chronicler spoke to Spyro telepathically that when the young dragon awakens, the world he knew would be different, but notes to Spyro that he won't be alone and has allies.The Legend of Spyro: Dawn of the Dragon  Within the remains of the Well of Souls, Spyro, Sparx and Cynder were released from their three year-long slumber by a group of Grublins, who chained the two dragons together with an invisible string generated by two glowing snakes around their necks. They were immediately dragged away to the Catacombs afterwards to be sacrificed to an\u00a0earth Golem under Malefor's orders. Spyro and Cynder soon awakened and found themselves chained to the floor of a large platform within the Catacombs, where they were attacked by the Grublins and the massive Golem. The two dragons couldn't fight the Golem while tethered together until a cheetah warrior, Hunter, sent the monster off in a painful retreat after he shot it in the eye.  Hunter then revealed that Ignitus sent him to find Spyro and Cynder three years ago, much to their disbelief. They narrowly escaped the Catacombs, ripping off the Golem's arm in the process. Within the Enchanted Forest, Hunter told them that the Dark Master, Malefor, had returned and covered the land in shadow, having reclaimed the Dragon Temple and had been at war with the Realms ever since. After hearing this, Spyro began to blame himself for failing to come back to the others sooner and letting the inhabitants down when Malefor returned. He was reassured by Cynder that some things were beyond his control. Suddenly, they were taken captive by Hunter's tribe, with Chief Prowlus, the leader of the cheetahs, who doesn't trust Dragons due to Malefor and Cynder when she was under the latter's control. After saving the village from Grublins, Spyro and Cynder convinced Prowlus that they weren't evil by saving a missing villager named Meadow. Hunter proceeded to lead them through the Forbidden Passage to the Dragon City of Warfang. Once there, the city became under attack by the Golem and an army of Grublins. They successfully repelled the attack, killing the Golem in the process. Afterwards, Spyro and Cynder reunited with the Guardians after three long years. That night, Malefor gave the citizens of Warfang a message that he had awakened the Destroyer, a beast that recreates the world by bringing about its destruction. Before this could happen, it had to complete a circle around the world called The Ring of Annihilation which would make the Belt of Fire spread out over the world and burning everything that it crosses over. Ignitus hatched a plan to stop it from underground, and had Spyro and Cynder open the doors to the Ruins of Warfang from the inside in order to reach the area where Destroyer would end its journey. As they made their way through, Spyro was comforted by Ignitus when the young dragon was worried about what was going to happen and how he would end up like Malefor. The Fire Guardian reassured that Spyro's existence as the only good purple dragon was nature's way of balancing itself, cancelling out Malefor's evil. Once they've reached the location, Cynder thought of a plan to destroy the Dam, flooding the valley and halting the Destroyer's progress. They managed to do so and entered the Destroyer's heart, destroying the dark crystal controlling it. Even though they destroyed the dark gem that was the heart of the Destroyer, Malefor used his dark magic to control the beast and it still managed to complete its Circle.  The rest of the inhabitants headed for underground, while Ignitus escorted Cynder and Spyro through the Belt of Fire to confront Malefor. However, the Fire Guardian sacrificed himself to allow the two dragons to get pass unscatched. Spyro, in his grief, almost lost himself to the darkness he fell into three years ago and turned into Dark Spyro, but Cynder's words pulled him out, and she expressed her condolence by telling him he was not alone and nuzzled him lovingly. After a few final fights in the Burned Lands and later on the Floating Islands, Spyro and Cynder finally confronted Malefor, who taunted Spyro by saying that they have more in common than just their color. Spyro denied this, proclaiming that he is nothing like Malefor, who then proceeded to free both Spyro and Cynder of the chain that binded them together throughout their trials. Malefor then claimed that his influence over Cynder had not completely diminished and that she had led Spyro to the Well of Souls to trick him into freeing the evil dragon. Cynder both denied Malefor's words, but gradually grew unsure, to which Malefor replied by taking control over her again and renewing her dark side. A dismayed Spyro was attacked relentlessly by Cynder, as Malefor assured Spyro that there have been many purple dragons before him and that their true role was to resurrect the Destroyer and the Golems of the Deep to bring about \"The Great Cleansing\", destroying the world. Spyro denied Malefor's statements and continued to be struck by Cynder relentlessly, though he made no effort to fight back as Malefor laughed maniacally. When Cynder furiously demanded to Spyro why he wouldn't fight back, he revealed that she had left him nothing to fight for. Hearing this, Cynder broke free from Malefor's control, and told him that there is always something. Enraged, Malefor chained Cynder back to Spyro, declaring that she would share his fate before\u00a0attacking the two young dragons in the skies above the temple. During their first phase in the battle, the Destroyer managed to throw itself back into the volcano from whence it came, thus completing its circuit and beginning the destruction of their world. Spyro, Cynder, and Malefor continued to fight, however, the Dark Master was soon thrown down to the planet's heart, a giant purple crystal, by a joint attack. Malefor declared that he cannot be defeated as he was eternal. However, several dragon spirits emerged from the purple crystal upon these words, and proceeded to drag Malefor into the planet's heart, sealing him away, much to his dismay and the awe of Spyro and Cynder.  With Malefor gone, the chain that binded Spyro and Cynder together disappeared along with his dark magic, but the Dark Master's plan was still underway as the planet was breaking itself apart. As the world was being destroyed, Spyro was given hope by Ignitus's spirit, and then instructed Cynder to flee as he had discovered what he had to do to stop the destruction. But Cynder, who didn't want to leave Spyro, decided to stay with him. As Spyro unleashed a powerful fury wave, Cynder was heard whispering to him, \"I love you\" before Spyro's desperate endeavor reconstructed the world. As the survivors resurfaced, they gazed up at the stars as they formed a shape of a dragon. After the credits, the Chronicler chose the spirit of Ignitus to be the next Chronicler of the new age. Before passing his mantle, the Chronicler informed Ignitus that although he has tried his best, he cannot find any trace of Spyro in the book that details dragons who have died. As Ignitus began searching through the book to find where Spyro might be, the scene changes to the scenery of the Valley of Avalar. Spyro and Cynder were seen wheeling through the skies above the valley, but their fate is left open to interpretation.The Legend of Spyro 3D  According to the plot sypnosis of the cancelled Spyro Movie, Spyro's egg was guarded by Ignitus, but it was being hunted. Knowing that the egg was no longer safe, Ignitus hands it to a woodland full of Dragonflies, who then protected the egg and raised Spyro as one of their own. Brought up alongside Sparx, Spyro was lead to believe that he himself was a dragonfly, who just happens to be slightly bigger and purpler than the others. One day, the dragonfly village was suddenly attacked, and Spyro was found. Spyro instinctively used his unknown powers to fend off the attackers, and afterwards realised just how different he was. Confused and upset, he learns that he is not in fact a dragonfly, but a dragon who carries the role of being part of a great prophecy that will bring peace to all the land. Spyro, along with his trusty sidekick, Sparx, embarks on an adventure to ensure the demise of the deadly Dark Master. However, between them stands Cynder, a very powerful black dragon powered by the red crystal around her neck, which enslaves her to the Dark Master.Relationships Sparx  Spyro and Sparx are described as an \"oddly matched pair of brothers the world has never seen\". The two are very close, having never been apart up until the middle of the events of Dawn of the Dragon. Sparx serves as Spyro's sidekick, saying wisecracks and providing Spyro company throughout his journey. While he is frequently annoyed by Sparx's constant jokes and sarcasm, Spyro doesn't miss the chance to get smart with Sparx, such as when he learns to fly and Sparx \"welcomes him to the club\", he replies if it's \"the annoying pest club\". Still, Spyro cares deeply about Sparx and worries about his safety, shown when he refused to let Sparx join him at the Burned Lands, worried that he wouldn't survive. Spyro dislikes that Sparx doesn't trust Cynder after she was released from Malefor's control.Cynder  At first, Spyro only knew Cynder from the Dragon Guardian's stories and a few glimpses of her corrupted form, so he saw her as an enemy who must be stopped. During his first encounter with her at Munitions Forge, he was strongly scared of her and didn't deny his fear. With the help of Terrador, Spyro was able to overcome his fear. After learning the truth about Cynder from Ignitus, he felt sorry for her, realizing she is another victim of the Dark Master, but was still determined to stop her. After releasing Cynder from Malefor's influence, Spyro didn't hesitate to save her and didn't blame her for anything she did while under the Dark Master's control. During the few weeks that Cynder stayed at the temple, Spyro developed feelings for the black dragoness, and grew to truly understand her as time passed. He was desperate to stop Cynder from leaving the temple and was visibly hurt when she left anyways.\u00a0Most (if not all) of his actions during\u00a0The Eternal Night were driven by his feelings towards Cynder, and as shown during his time at the White Isle, his biggest fear is her becoming Malefor's servant again. When that fear became true during his confrontation with Malefor, Spyro refused to fight her, simply stating that without her, he had nothing left worth fighting for. As the series progressed, his feelings for Cynder became more obvious, by Dawn of the Dragon, both would frequently gaze at each others' eyes and comfort each other. Spyro also rarely complained about being chained to Cynder and his only complaints were aimed towards the chain hindering them in battle rather than Cynder herself. When Spyro decided to give up his life to restore the world, he wanted Cynder to save herself and was clearly touched when she chose to stay with him.\u00a0Ignitus  Spyro sees Ignitus as a father figure and mentor, being quite close to the Fire Dragon Guardian. He is often encouraged by Ignitus and was eager to train with him. He was shown to have had a hard time accepting that he'd have to abandon Ignitus at Munitions Forge and wait to rescue him until later. Upon Ignitus's death, Spyro became devastated, at first refusing to believe that his mentor had died, succumbing to the darkness he fell into The Eternal Night in his grief and attempting to re-enter the flames of the Belt of Fire in order to \"rescue\" him. Cynder managed to bring Spyro out of the dark influence, and the young dragon sadly accepts Ignitus's death. With Ignitus gone, Spyro felt alone, but was comforted by Cynder who told Spyro that he wasn't. Unknown to Spyro, Ignitus became the Chronicler of the new age. Spyro seemingly picked Ignitus's habit of blaming himself for everything and being overly harsh with himself.Malefor  Through most of A New Beginning,\u00a0Spyro was unaware of Malefor's existence, and when he learned of it, he only knew Malefor by his alias, \"The Dark Master\". When Spyro discovered that the Dark Master was controlling Cynder, he was determined to stop him, and only blamed Malefor for all what Cynder had done. After the Dark Master's apparent first defeat, Spyro remained alert for signs of his return and wanted to continue fighting against him. However, when Spyro found out that the Dark Master is a Purple Dragon just like him and several characters pointed out similarities between him and Malefor (some of which Spyro noticed himself), he began feeling insecure about being a Purple Dragon, and then showed concerns that he might end up becoming just like Malefor. Ignitus assured him that they are different. When Spyro met Malefor in person, he denied their similarities, but Malefor's claims that Spyro was the one who freed him and helped destroy the world made his doubts temporarily return.The Chronicler  Initially Spyro fully trusted the Chronicler and liked that he was helping him recover his powers and teach him to control Time. With each encounter, Spyro visibly becomes more irritated that the path the Chronicler was guiding him through was leading nowhere, and that he only gives confusing, incomplete glimpses of what to do next. When Spyro met the Chronicler in person, and was told of the dark fates waiting for everyone he knew, he finally snaps and angrily scolds the Chronicler for him not giving others the chance to choose their own paths (especially Cynder). He then disobeys the Chronicler's advice to \"ride out this storm\" and leaves not wanting to listen to him anymore, stating that he has to follow the path he believes is right. However, Spyro did follow the Chronicler's advice after all. When the Well of Souls was collapsing, and when the Chronicler contacted him in Dawn of the Dragon, Spyro didn't show any signs of still being angry with him.Flash and Nina  Spyro is the foster son of the dragonfly couple, Flash and Nina. Having been raised by them, Spyro treats Flash and Nina as his mother and father, and despite discovering that they aren't his real parents, he still considers them as his family.Character Development  John Welsh, Producer of A New Beginning in Krome Stuidos, stated that Spyro as a character had also embodied the same stronger lines, tones and textures that are concurrent and thematic throughout the game. His crest, back ridges, horns and tail fin indicate the strength of his character and that was all very deliberate. However, he is nevertheless absolutely recognizable as the character he is. He is roughly the same age as in previous games and his character is similar in nature (although this obviously develops with the story and the through the realization of what he is capable of).See also Notes Trivia Ignitor  Ignitor (\u30a4\u30b0\u30ca\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc in Japanese) is a fire knight spirit who is one of the playable Skylanders in the Skylanders series, first appearing in Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure.

He also developed a hatred for witches due to one having cursed him in the first place.Biography  On his first quest as a knight, Ignitor was tricked by a cunning witch into wearing a magical suit of armor that he was told would resist fire from a dragon. As it turned out, it was made of cursed steel. He journeyed to a dragon's lair where a single blast of fire transformed him into a blazing spirit, binding him to the suit of armor for eternity. Despite this setback, Ignitor remains a spirited knight who is always fired up to protect the lands from evil and find the witch that tricked him.Story History  When first he encountered the red dragon, Ignatius was a young knight with squeaky armour and a rusty sword. On his way to slay the beast, he met a witch who presented him with a special (and handy) gift - a magical suit of armour offering protection from dragon breath. But a nasty surprise was waiting for Ignatius at the dragon's lair. The monster rained its fiery breath over the knight's poor head, settling him on fire. Ignatius had been tricked!

His Series 1 figure is available only in the Pirate Seas Adventure Pack, but his Series 2 figure is available in a single pack. His Series 3 counterpart is named Knockout Terrafin, and will be available in a battle pack along with Bumble Blast.Background Personality  Terrafin is a fighter and has a personality to match. He is rough, physically minded, and blunt in his dealings with others. His comments in the various Skylanders media suggest that he's got a personality based on B.A. Barracus from the A-Team TV Series.Biography  Terrafin hails from The Dirt Seas, where it was common to swim, bathe, and even snorkel beneath the ground. But a powerful explosion in the sky created a blast wave that turned the ocean of sand into a vast sheet of glass, putting an end to Terrafin's duty as the local lifeguard. Not one to stay idle, the brawny dirt shark found himself training in the art of boxing, and not long after, he was local champ, earning treasure by competing in local battle arenas. Fighters came from all around to challenge him, but it was a chance meeting with a great Portal Master that led him to give up his title for a greater purpose.Story History  Terrafin is the brawling shark boxer who likes close quarter combat. Terrafin built up his brawny biceps on the beaches of The Dirt Sea, where he worked as a lifeguard. In between fin-ups and jaw-curls he would patrol the dry, sandy waves and save struggling dune-swimmers from a lifetime of finding sand in unusual places. One day, an explosion in the sky threatened every swimmer, surfer and jet-skier in (and above) The Dirt Sea. Terrafin leapt from his life-saving seat and cleared the area in seconds. Moments later, the blast burned across the sand and scorched it into a solid sheet of glass. Now unemployed, Terrafin trained himself as a tournament boxer. He even developed his own signature move: the risky 'over under', where he would punch, dive underground, and surface for the finishing blow. After body-slamming every suitable successor into stunned submission, Terrafin hung up his boxing belt. Now, at Master Eon's suggestion, Terrafin only dukes it out with enemies of Skylands - and often daydreams of knocking out Kaos in bare-knuckled bout. During his days as a Skylander, a burrowing Terrafin collided into the dormant Drill Sergeant underground and brought the Arkeyan Ultron to Master Eon. The old Portal Master used his magic to fire up Drill Sergeant's systems to bring him to life. By Arkeyan custom, Drill Sergeant was then obligated to become Terrafin's servant, but the dirt shark didn't like the idea, so Terrafin's first order as master was for Drill Sergeant to not serve him at all.Skylanders: Spyro versus The Mega Monsters  Terrafin made a cameo as one of the Skylanders called by Master Eon to help restore the walls of the Eternal Archives after they were damaged by Kaos during his attempt to steal the Book of Power.Skylanders: Gill Grunt and the Curse of the Fish Master  As the Skylanders finished repairing the walls of the Archives, Terrafin burrowed underground when Gill Grunt was about to sing a song about their accomplishment, supposedly to avoid hearing the Gillman's horrible singing.Skylanders: Terrafin Battles the Boom Brothers  Terrafin was enjoying a day-off at the Fantastic Fairy Fair with fellow Skylanders, Hot Dog and Sonic Boom. The trio of Skylanders soon discovered a sad Stone Golem named Rocky who was under the unwilling employment of Professor Puck, the fair's owner who took Rocky from his home after discovering that the golem's magical, singing voice made everyone within earshot dance. After saving Gurglefin from a sticky cluster of candyfloss, the Skylanders attended Puck's circus show with Rocky being the star attraction due to his singing. Soon, the show was interrupted when a group of Trolls and the evil Floss-O-Tron 3000 trapped everyone, including the Skylanders, under a layer of sticky candyfloss, and kidnapped Rocky under of Kaos, believing him to be the Earth segment to the Mask of Power. Thanks to Hot Dog's fire power, the Skylanders were able to free themselves and the crowd from the candyfloss. Terrafin soon came across\u00a0Sprocket, who was in a sticky predicament, and assisted her\u00a0in their battle against Kaos, the Trolls, and Floss-O-Tron 3000, soon saving the circus from a sticky explosion.\u00a0 The Skylanders returned to the Eternal Archives after discovering a leftover clue that helped them learn about the Boom Brothers, a pair of robots responsible for making explosives. Figuring that that the Explosive Emporium is where Kaos had taken Rocky, Terrafin went with Hot Dog, Sonic Boom, and Sprocket to Junk Mountain where the explosions factory laid. After getting past an aggressive Trash Ogre and the emporium's security, the Skylanders were able to sneak inside and find Rocky only to fall into a trap made by Kaos and the Boom Brothers. The evil Portal Master then forced the heroes to dance uncontrollably by throwing sticks of dynamite that contained Rocky's enchanted singing called disco dynamite. Terrafin quickly thought of a plan and instructed Sonic Boom to use her ear-piercing screech to drown the Boom Brother's disco dynamite and help stop the Skylanders from dancing. Thanks to this, the Skylanders were able to disorient the Boom Brothers, drive Kaos out of the room and sealed themselves inside the chamber, which turned out to be the inner section of a large rocket they were in. Kaos then threatened to blow the Skylanders sky-high should they refuse to let him and his troll army back inside the rocket and turn over Rocky to them. Even worse, the Boom Brothers recovered from the attack and was holding Hot Dog hostage, also threatening the Skylanders to surrender otherwise the robots would detonate the whole room using a pineapple grenade. Terrafin pretended to surrender to the Boom Brothers, tricking them into arguing with one another until one of the brothers forced the pineapple grenade down his sibling's throat, causing them both to explode.\u00a0 With the danger of the Boom Brothers gone, there was still the threat of Kaos ordering the Skylanders to surrender Rocky. Sprocket unintentionally launched the rocket, sending the Skylanders away from Junk Mountain and leaving Kaos and his troll army under what was left of the Explosive Emporium. Back at the Eternal Archive, the Skylanders discovered that the Earth segment wasn't Rocky, but his singing voice, which was given to him centuries ago by one of the Spell Punks who first split the Mask of Power. They soon accompanied Rocky back to the fair and attended his show, which turned out to be disastrous for Professor Puck when Rocky's true, terrible singing voice was made known. This caused the audience to turn against Puck as they paid him to hear Rocky sing his magical voice that he lost and proceeded to run Puck out of town, leaving the Skylanders and Rocky satisfied over their victory.Skylanders: Trigger Happy Targets the Evil Kaos  Terrafin was one of the Skylanders who assembled to stop Kaos from reforming the Mask of Power. Despite getting through Kaos's defenses in his castle, the Skylanders were unable to stop Kaos from putting on the Mask of Power, which allowed him to steal the powers of the Skylanders, including Terrafin's, rendering them defenseless. Terrafin and the other Skylanders were teleported back to Eon's Citadel by Master Eon before they can be finished off. With his best abilities stolen from him, the dirt shark worked with the Skylanders in creating a makeshift tower to protect the Core of Light from Kaos.\u00a0 Despite their efforts, with Terrafin joining with Slobber Tooth and Stump Smash as the first wave of attack, Kaos once again overwhelmed the Skylanders by using their powers against them. Trigger Happy, along with Terrafin and the other Skylanders, tricked Kaos into using all of their powers at the same time, causing him to lose control. At that moment of weakness, the Mask of Power was yanked off of Kaos's face by Trigger Happy, allowing the Skylanders to recover their abilities and use them to fully destroy the Mask of Power once and for all.Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure  Terrafin was one of the Skylanders who assembled to Master Eon when Kaos and The Darkness approached the Ruins. The dirt shark then participated in the battle against Kaos's minions to protect the Core of Light along with the other Skylanders, stopping a lone Cyclops Chopper from fleeing before beating it with a few swift punches. Upon the Cyclops's defeat, Terrafin ate one of the XP orbs that were left behind by the enemy and burrowed through the ground, taking out a few enemies in his way with his dorsal fin and proceeded to chased down a small group of Cyclops Choppers before leaping out of the ground and bodyslamming them to nothingness. As the Skylanders were winning the struggle, Kaos released his Hydra into the fray, and it destroyed the Core of Light. During the confusion, Terrafin, along with the other Skylanders, were banished from Skylands and sent to Earth, where he became frozen as a toy due to the world's lack of magic. He waited for the new Portal Master to find and help him save Skylands.Skylanders Issue #8  Terrafin was one of the forty Skylanders that were summoned to stop Malefor from reaching the Skylanders Academy. However despite their best efforts, they were defeated by the evil dragon, who proceeded to drain their powers with a crystal to make himself more stronger.Rift into Overdrive  When strange rifts began appearing around Skylands, Terrafin volunteered to go with Jet-Vac and Stealth Elf to Know-It-All Island\u00a0to look for answers regarding the Rift Engines, mostly to get payback for what Kaos' minions had done to a group of Skylanders that were searching for the evil Portal Master. Once at Know-It-All Island, the Skylanders and Flynn encountered Blobbers, who was sent by his village to learn about the strange rifts that were destroying everything across Skylands. A nearby Stone Head revealed to the group the history behind the Rift Engines and the fact that Kaos had awakened a power hidden long ago. Before the Stone Head could begin to tell the location of the Rift Engines, Kaos himself opened a rift and it consumed the island as soon as the Stone Head told a riddle to the Skylanders regarding the Rift Engine location. The Skylanders and their friends were soon rescued by non-Skylanders, Spitfire and Stormblade, who transported them all to safety with their vehicles. After getting acquainted with Spitfire, Stormblade, and other non-Skylanders, Fiesta and Dive-Clops, Terrafin and the other Skylanders allowed the SuperChargers to help the Skylanders on their journey as there was no other available transportation. While treking through Skylands, the Skylanders and SuperChargers figured out the Stone Head's riddle and came to the Whirlpool of Destiny where the Rift Engines were hidden in an underwater city. Being a dirt shark, Terrafin expressed his dislike in going underwater. While Dive-Clops and Gill Grunt used the Dive Bomber to begin their search underwater, Terrafin and the other land Skylanders held back a group of Kaos' minions to buy their friends some time. As they were about to become overwhelmed, Gill Grunt and Dive-Clops succeeded in hauling the Rift Engines from the underwater depths. Terrafin, Stealth Elf and Jet-Vac were shocked at seeing Gill Grunt's SuperCharged form, who quickly instructed his three companions to unlock the chest and hope the Rift Engines inside chooses them. As they touched the Rift Engines, Terrafin, Stealth Elf and Jet-Vac were granted the powers of SuperChargers which transformed them, and they used their newfound abilities to drive off Kaos' minions. With the Rift Engines at their disposal, the Skylanders, and the newly-formed Skylander SuperChargers, began their adventure in stopping Kaos and his latest plan.Abilities  Terrafin has the ability to burrow through the ground and shoot out of it to leap high into the air and bodyslam his enemies. He also boxes and punches his opponents, having trained himself in the art of boxing. Terrafin is primarily a close-range fighter Skylander. His Punches and Bellyflops are devastating at close range, and his Earth Swim ability allows him to close distance on enemies easily and safely. His Feeding Frenzy mini-shark technique also gives him all small amount of power even at a distance. But his mini sharks do weak damage, making him not as useful for long range. His upgrade paths allow him to improve his burrowing and minisharks, or his close-combat melee abilities. Terrafin is untouchable while Earth Swimming, taking no damage from attacks or traps and passing by enemies unharmed. This ability, combined with the boost in speed generated by Earth Swimming, make Terrafin an excellent choice for getting a handle on the layout of the Heroic Challenges.Console Stats  These are the starting and maximum statistics for this Skylander in the console version of the games.Power Stats  Warning: These stats are not used in any of the Skylander games.

He is brave, but can also be charming and charismatic. Lightning Rod even considers everyone else in Skylands to be 'girlie', especially girls, and few are brave enough to argue with him!Biography  Lightning Rod once lived in the majestic Cloud Kingdom, where his countless acts of heroism along with his winning smile and electric physique made him the most famous storm giant in the realm. He was a true celebrity, and the palace halls were littered with statues of the chiselled hero. But all the praise and admiration could never quite satisfy Rod, who yearned for something more. As luck would have it, he met an adventurous young dragon named Spyro, who told him fantastic stories of faraway places and dangerous adventures. Rod was spellbound, and he set off with Spyro to seek an audience with Eon to join the Skylanders.Story History  The storm giants are the ancient athletic heroes of Skylands who like to be number one in every event. Aside from being able to bench-press 250 tons, few things are important to the storm giants than their grand competitive games. And the celebrated champion of the storm giant sporting elite is Lightning Rod. Lighting Rod is the giants' most talented thrower, and sat atop of the table in the thousand-metre lightning bolt hurl for many a year (that was until he sent a stray bolt into the crowd, electrifying a spectating cyclops in the process). But it was during a different event - the triple gold ring lightning bolt toss with a twist - that Rod hit the headlines. Just as he was flexing for the throw, Kaos' giant projected head appeared above the crowd, demanding - as usual - that all in attendance submit to his rule. Lightning Rod wasn't used to sharing the spotlight, so he hurled his bolt skyward. So powerful was the throw that it ripped past the project and into Kaos himself, who was hiding behind in an airship. Seething with anger and spitting blue sparks, Kaos had to accept defeat and flew away. But another attending Portal Master - Eon - had also seen the action, and immediately made Lightning Rod a Skylander.Skylanders: Lightning Rod Faces the Cyclops Queen  At the start of the Annual Storm Titan Games, Lightning Rod accidentally hurled a large hammer in the path of Flynn's balloon, causing it to spiral out of the control. The Skylanders quickly came to the rescue, knocking away the balloon's dangerous debris from the spectators within the stadium and saving Flynn, Double Trouble, Hugo and a Warrior Librarian named Squirmgrub\u00a0who were on board the balloon from crashing. Hugo then told Master Eon that the Mask of Power had revealed the location of the next fragment to the Mask of Power, and that Squirmgrub has also discovered something about the malevolent item.  Within the stadium, the Skylanders discovered that the Air segment to the Mask of Power has seemingly taken on the form of a Land Whale, which was stationed at a zoo held by the Cyclops Queen at Tempest Towers. Master Eon sends Lightning Rod, Pop Fizz, Drobot, Double Trouble,\u00a0Cali, and Flynn to the Tempest Towers that lied beyond the Sea of Storms in their mission to claim the Air fragment before Kaos made his move. However before they could depart, Kaos captured Cali, who knew the path to Tempest Towers. The Skylanders gave chase, following Kaos while treking through the Sea of Storms and battling Windbag Djinnis in the process. They managed to get to Tempest Towers and trick their way inside with Pop Fizz's beserker form posing as a never-before-seen creature, while Flynn and Double Trouble keep a lookout for Kaos. However after tricking the Cyclops Queen and her husband, Pipsqueak, the Skylanders were found out, and Lightning Rod and Drobot were thrown to the tank where the immobile Land Whale resided. The Storm Giant became hypnotized by the Whale and began walking towards its open jaws, but Drobot quickly distracted the monster long enough for Lightning Rod to break of the Land Whale's hypnosis and free the robot dragon before he was eaten alive. The two Skylanders escaped with Pop Fizz in time to see Kaos and his army of Drow battling against the Cyclops Queen's forces, with Kaos winning the struggle. Knowing that Kaos was after the Land Whale for the Air fragment, Lightning Rod hurled the Whale far from Tempest Towers, and the evil Portal Master hastily followed after it. The Skylanders were confused by Lighting Rod's action, but discovered that the Air fragment was really one of the towers of the city, which was made of Cyclopnite, the heaviest stone ever mined, and the opposite of the Air element. Lightning Rod drank one of Pop Fizz's potions to grow to a humungous size big enough to carry the tower back to the Eternal Archive. After releasing the animals imprisoned by the Cyclops Queen back to their respectable homes, and retrieving the Air segment, Lightning Rod was returned to his original size, and surprisingly shared the glory of stopping Kaos with the other Skylanders. Unknown to the Skylanders, there was a traitor in their mist who had been revealing the locations of the Mask of Power to Kaos: Squirmgrub.\u00a0Abilities  Being a storm giant, Lightning Rod can throw lightning bolts and summon a large lightning bolt to strike down from the heavens to vanquish his foes. He can also send out electrical discharges from his cloud base to electrocute surrounding enemies.Console Stats  These are the starting and maximum statistics for this Skylander in the console version of the games.Power Stats  Warning: These stats are not used in any of the Skylander games.

Buddy Wrecking Ball is available exclusively on Skylanders: Lost Islands during the month of May.Background Personality  Wrecking Ball can be reckless, destructive, and possess a giant appetite. He is lively, never content unless he smashes things up (never on purpose). In some media, he shows dog-like qualities.Biography  Wrecking Ball was once a tiny grub worm about to become the main ingredient in an old wizard\u2019s cauldron of magic stew. But when he was dropped in, the wizard was shocked to see the little grub devour all of the soup and emerge from the cauldron 20 times larger and with a long, sticky tongue. The poor old wizard was even more surprised seconds later, when Wrecking Ball proceeded to swallow him whole. Eventually he ran, quite literally, into the powerful Portal Master Eon, who was intrigued by how he came to be and impressed with his unique abilities.Story History  Once upon a time, Wrecking Ball was nothing more than a common or garden grub. His adventure began when he became a speciality ingredient in a wizard's magical stew. After being chucked into the cooking concoction, a curious occurrence took place. The hungry little grub worm took a sip, and then a gulp, and ended up devouring the whole lot. When the wizard came in to check on his cauldron, instead of his tasty stew he found one enormous grub who had grown to over twenty times his original size. And as Wrecking Ball was still a little peckish, he popped the wizard in his mouth too - only to spit him straight back out again (even to a grub's standard's, the wizard tasted like a warthog!). The story soon spread, raising smiles across the Skylands world. Soon the plucky grub bounced into Master Eon, who evidently felt that the Skylanders could do with a serious stomach among their ranks.Skylanders: Stump Smash Crosses the Bone Dragon  Wrecking Ball was assigned with Countdown and Flameslinger to accompany Stump Smash to the Giggling Forest to investigate why the trees had stopped giggling. There, they discover that several of the living trees and Kaos' trolls were turned to stone by an unknown force, which soon revealed itself to be an angry Bone Dragon. During the attack, Flameslinger's bow was turned to stone by the Dragon's petrifying breath and Flynn's hot air balloon was petrified as well. The beast cornered the Skylanders, but Wrecking Ball quickly expelled a Power Belch at the Bone Dragon to drive it away, allowing the Skylanders to escape with a partially petrified Glumshanks. Upon learning more about the Bone Dragon at the Eternal Archives, Wrecking Ball once again went with Stump Smash and Countdown to Troll Bastion to attack the fort and find Kaos. They fought against many trolls, eventually coming into contact with General Disaster. Whe the troll general readied two dozen missiles to fire at Wrecking Ball, the grub worm simply lashed out his tongue and swallowed General Disaster whole before he could fire his weapons. The Skylanders found the petrified forms of Kaos and Master Eon, and Wrecking Ball cried out to Stump Smash in alarm when he saw the ent was about to smash Kaos's statue to pieces as retribution for Eon's petrification, but reconsidered it. With the help of Wrecking Ball's gassy indigestion from eating General Disaster, the Skylanders were able to escape the Troll Bastion on Flynn's balloon.Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure  After being banished from Skylands along with the other Skylanders, being a frozen statue was a living nightmare for Wrecking Ball. This lively, giant blue grub is never content unless he's smashing things around him (never on purpose). His thoughts were a mix between food and how to unleash his rapidly building energy.Abilities  Having consumed an entire cauldron of magic stew, its effects not only made Wrecking Ball grow 20 times his normal size and enhanced him with [[[Magic (Skylanders)magical energy]], but also gave him a long, sticky tongue which he uses to lash at his enemies. He can also curl into a ball and steamroll into his enemies using the magical energy he uses as a forcefield. Wrecking Ball can also let loose out a burp of gas from his mouth to blow enemies away, and can also devour medium or small enemies to regain health if he has gained his Soul Gem ability.Console Stats  These are the starting and maximum statistics for this Skylander in the console version of the games.Power Stats  Warning: These stats are not used in any of the Skylander games.

He can turn his hand to any technology and is ferocious in battle. Drobot may be extremely smart, but he never shies away from a fight. Instead of waiting to be invited to be a Skylander, Drobot sought out Master Eon and offered his services.Biography  Dragons are smart, but none so much as Drobot. He was born in the highest reaches of Skylands, where dragons spent all their time competing in aerial battles. But Drobot was more interested in taking things apart to see how they worked. While exploring one day, Drobot came upon some mysterious technology, and used his intelligence to assemble a robotic suit that would make him just as powerful as his fellow dragons... if not more so. His suit features laser beams that shoot from his eyes, flight enhancement technology, a vocal synthesizer that gives him a deep booming voice, and the ability to shoot spinning gears at a high velocity. With such power, more than most other dragons, Drobot joined the Skylanders to help protect the residents of Skylands.Story History  As a young dragon, Drobot often felt like an odd one out. While his friends focused on flying, fighting and aerial frolics, Drobot spent his time studying gadgets and gizmos. One day, the inexperienced flyer was caught in a terrible tailwind and forced down to a desert island. To his surprise, he found himself surrounded by magnificent machines, amazing appliances, and clever contraptions. At once, he made the island his widget workshop. Before long he had built himself a brand spanking new robotic flying suit with sensational super powers. A vocal synthesizer gave his voice a deep sonic boom, his eyes fired laser beams and he could shoot spinning gears at lightning speeds. Nowadays, Drobot is a dragon master supreme when it comes to sparring in the skies. And, with his homeland suddenly starting to feel a bit small, Drobot flew out to seek a certain Portal Master and sign up as a Skylander.Skylanders: Lightning Rod Faces the Cyclops Queen  Drobot was among few of the Skylanders who participtated in attending the Annual Storm Titan Games to see Lightning Rod in action. Just as the event had begun, Lighting Rod's hammer accidentally hit Flynn's air balloon that was flying overhead, causing it to spiral out of control and sending debris everywhere. Drobot quickly dispatched to stop the balloon from crashing, succeeding in saving Flynn, Hugo, Double Trouble, and Squirmgrub. When the Air segment to the Mask of Power was said to be in the form of the last Land Whale held within Tempest Towers, Drobot went with Lightning Rod, Pop Fizz, Double Trouble, Cali, and Flynn to retrieve it before Kaos could have the chance. However Kaos already knew the location to the Air segment and captured Cali for the path to the Towers. Thanks to Drobot's supercharged Afterburners, the Skylanders were able to whizz past Kaos through the Sea of Storms and reach their destination, despite Drobot's malfunctioning afterburners. As Double Trouble and Flynn kept a lookout for Kaos, Drobot came with Lightning Rod and Pop Fizz to get into the Cyclops city where the Land Whale\u00a0resided in a collection of animals imprisoned by the Cyclops Queen. However the Skylanders were discovered, and the Cyclops Queen had Drobot and Lightning Rod thrown in the tank with the Land Whale to be eaten.  When the Land Whale was hypnotizing Lightning Rod into going towards its open jaws to be devoured, Drobot quickly distracted the beast in an attempt to save his companion, but nearly got eaten as a result. The robotic dragon was quickly pulled from the Land Whale's slobbering jaws by the freed Lightning Rod, and they made their escape from their imprisonment with Pop Fizz. Outside the tower, the Skylanders saw Kaos and his army of Drow battling against the Cyclops Queen's forces, with Kaos winning the struggle. When Lightning Rod hurled the Land Whale far from Tempest Towers with Kaos giving chase, Drobot was confused to why the Storm Giant would throw away the Air segment. They immediately discovered that the Air fragment wasn't the Land Whale itself, but was really one of the towers of the Cyclops city, which was made of Cyclopnite, the heaviest stone ever mined, and the opposite of the Air element. With the help of a humungous Lightning Rod, the Skylanders returned to the Eternal Archive with the tower, and claim the Air segment to the Mask of Power, unaware that there was a traitor in their mist revealing the location of the Mask fragments to Kaos.Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure  Even Drobot's powerful, flight-enhanced robotic suit could do nothing to prevent him from joining the other Skylanders in frozen exile when Kaos destroyed the Core of Light. He no doubt spent much of his time thinking up new gadgets to break the spell that locks him in toy form.Abilities  Wearing his robotic suit, Drobot has the ability to shoot laser beams from his eyes. He can also launch spinning uranium bladegears that can hit against enemies and surrounding objects. Being a dragon, he has the ability to fly, but being an inexperienced flyer, Drobot uses his robot suit to fly, also possessing the power to hover in the air like a jet using his robotic wings. Series 2 Drobot's Wow Pow Power involves having the ability to form two gears into a large gear that he can control to attack nearby enemies.Console Stats  These are the starting and maximum statistics for this Skylander in the console version of the games.Power Stats  Warning: These stats are not used in any of the Skylander games.

She is also cunning and brave.Biography  Long ago, Sonic Boom took refuge high atop a mountain peak in the far reaches of Skylands, hoping to keep her griffin hatchlings safe. But despite her precautions, a devious wizard tracked her down and placed a wicked curse on the griffin eggs. Once hatched, the young hatchlings can live for only mere moments before they magically return to their shells... only to be hatched again in an endless cycle. Wanting to prevent such evil from happening to others, Sonic Boom joined the Skylanders and has trained her young to defend Skylands each time they are hatched.Story History  When Sonic Boom chose the highest mountain peak to lay her eggs, little did she know that she was being watched by an evil wizard. Wearing a cloak of invisibility, the wizard made his way to Sonic Boom's nest, where he hoped to snatch a baby griffin feather for one of this wicked spells. Wizards live on a disgusting diet of liver and brussel sprouts so, while Sonic Boom could not see an egg-thief, she could certainly smell one. She filled the sky with an ear-shattering shriek and the wizard stumbled backwards out of his cloak. But as he fell, the wizard put the young hatchlings under a cruel curse. Now, the babies can only break from their eggs for mere minutes before returning to one of their eggs, trapped in an endless cycle of rebirth. Sonic Boom and her hatchlings have used the curse to their advantage, however, and are now the first Skylanders to fight as a family. Their specialty is wiping out spout-stinking wizards.Skylanders: Terrafin Battles the Boom Brothers  Sonic Boom and her hatchlings were enjoying a day-off at the Fantastic Fairy Fair with fellow Skylanders, Terrafin and Hot Dog. The griffin mother heard someone crying nearby and the trio of Skylanders came upon Rocky, a Rock Golem who was taken from his home by the fair's owner Professor Puck because of his magical singing voice that made everyone within earshot dance. After saving Gurglefin from a sticky cluster of cotton candy, the Skylanders attended Puck's circus show with Rocky being the star attraction due to his singing. Soon, the show was interrupted when a group of Trolls and the evil Floss-O-Tron 3000 trapped everyone, including the Skylanders, under a layer of sticky candyfloss, and kidnapped Rocky under orders of Kaos, believing him to be the Earth segment to the Mask of Power.  Thanks to Hot Dog's fire power, the Skylanders were able to free themselves and the crowd from the candyfloss. Both Sonic Boom and Hot Dog then assisted Terrafin and Sprocket in their battle against Kaos, the Trolls, and Floss-O-Tron 3000, saving the circus from a sticky explosion but were unable to rescue Rocky. The Skylanders returned to the Eternal Archives after discovering a leftover clue that helped them learn about the Boom Brothers, a pair of robots responsible for making explosives. Figuring out that the Explosive Emporium is where Kaos had taken Rocky, Sonic Boom, Terrafin, Hot Dog, and Sprocket journeyed to Junk Mountain where the explosions factory laid. After getting past an aggressive Trash Ogre and the emporium's security, the Skylanders were able to sneak inside and find Rocky only to fall into a trap made by Kaos and the Boom Brothers. The evil Portal Master then forced the heroes to dance uncontrollably by throwing sticks of dynamite that contained Rocky's enchanted singing called disco dynamite. Terrafin quickly thought of a plan and instructed Sonic Boom to use her ear-piercing screech to drown the Boom Brother's disco dynamite and help stop the Skylanders from dancing. Thanks to this, the Skylanders were able to drive Kaos out of the room and sealed themselves inside the chamber, which turns out to be the inner section of a large rocket they were in. Kaos then threatened to blow the Skylanders sky-high should they refuse to let him and his troll army back inside the rocket and turn over Rocky to them. Even worse, the Boom Brothers recovered from the attack and was holding Hot Dog hostage, also threatening the Skylanders to surrender otherwise the robots would detonate the whole room using a pineapple grenade. Sonic Boom, along with the other Skylanders, refused to give up, but was surprised when Terrafin admitted defeat. This soon turned out to be a plan quickly conjured by Terrafin, who tricked the Boom Brothers into arguing with one another until one of the brothers forced the pineapple grenade down his sibling's throat, causing them both to explode and releasing Hot Dog. With the danger of the Boom Brothers gone, there was still the threat of Kaos preparing to blow up the rocket they were in if they didn't surrender Rocky. The Skylanders were able to escape, using the rocket to fly out of Junk Mountain and leaving Kaos and his troll army under what was left of the Explosive Emporium. Back at the Eternal Archive, the Skylanders discovered that the Earth segment wasn't Rocky, but his singing voice, which was given to him centuries ago by one of the Spell Punks who first split the Mask of Power. They soon accompanied Rocky back to the fair and attended his show, which turned out to be disastrous for Professor Puck when Rocky's true, terrible singing voice was heard. This caused the audience to turn against Puck as they paid him to hear Rocky sing his magical voice that he lost and proceeded to run Puck out of town, leaving the Skylanders and Rocky satisfied over their victory.Abilities  Sonic Boom has the ability to shoot sonic waves from her mouth at her enemies. She can also toss out her eggs and her hatchlings will emerge from their egg shells to attack surrounding enemies and follow Sonic Boom around for a short while, until a later power upgrade allows them to hatch out as young griffins big enough to gain the ability to fly. After a while, they magically return to their egg shells due to the wizard's curse and must be released from their eggs again before repeating the attacking process. Not the finest example of parenting, but quite effective in battle. For her specialization paths, she can either chose to upgrade her Egg Toss hatchlings into being more easily usable or improve her Roar attack's potential range and damage.Series 1 Console Stats  These are the starting and maximum statistics for this Skylander in the console version of the games.Power Stats  Warning: These stats are not used in any of the Skylander games.

The game's first expansion pack, Gods & Kings, was released on June 19, 2012 in North America and June 22, 2012 elsewhere. A second expansion, Brave New World, was released on July 9, 2013 in North America and July 12, 2013 elsewhere.Civilizations and Leaders  There are eighteen civilizations available from the start of Civilization V, and seven additional civilizations are made available later through several small DLC add-ons. Nine more civilizations were added with the Gods & Kings expansion pack, and nine other civilizations were added with the Brave New World expansion pack, bringing the total number of civilizations to 43, the greatest number of civilizations that has ever been available in any Civilization game. This is the first incarnation of the series where the leaders speak in their native language in a fully animated diplomacy screen. This only applies to the audio; all text is in the language selected.Units  Civilization V has 87 units, ranging from military to civilian. Unlike in previous games, you can have only one unit of each type (Military/Civilian/Embarked) per hex. For example, you cannot have a Horseman and an Archer on one tile. This also applies to cities. Most units can move 2 hexes (4 hexes for mounted units) and are no longer destroyed if they lose a battle, taking damage instead. Players can swap a unit out with one next to it during battle. Units take longer to produce than in previous games. They also have higher upkeep costs, potentially reducing the number of units you can maintain at one time. The upkeep costs become more expensive the further you are into the game. There are no longer troop transports. Instead, units instantly transform into makeshift floating transports when moving into water after the 'Optics' technology is researched.City-States  One new concept in the game is the addition of city-states- small countries usually limited to a single city, that don't compete to win the game. However, they can expand their territory and acquire the same resources as any player can. They provide economic and diplomatic bonuses if you befriend or ally them by doing quests or giving gifts. If you are hostile toward a city-state, its allies become hostile towards you.Terrains  Civilization V also includes Natural Wonders which are automatically placed around the map. These wonders provide Happiness bonuses to any civilization that discovers them. Some of these natural wonders are: Old Faithful, Mount Fuji, Krakatoa, and the Great Barrier Reef. They also give additional bonuses to production and gold income when cities are founded near them or cover them with their territory.Resources  There are three types of resources: strategic resources, luxury resources and bonus resources. If you have more than 1 luxury resource, you can trade the excess with other civilizations. However, the same does not hold true for strategic resources. A single iron deposit, for example, yields between 2 and 9 iron resources letting you build that number of units that require 1 iron resource. Therefore, acquiring as many strategic resources you can is a must to support large armies.Improvements and Buildings  Civilization V has 71 buildings, 49 wonders, and 23 improvements. The number of unique buildings is included in the building count. Note that not every civilization has a unique building: some have a unique improvement or two unique units instead. Wonders come in the form of world wonders, national wonders and projects, just like in Civilization IV. The concept of tile improvements has been modified slightly: in addition to Workers and Work Boats, the Great People can now construct special improvements (or \"bulb\") too. Great People's special tile improvements replace any improvements already built on them. Roads can go through these special improvements, and they automatically hook up any strategic resources on those tiles. The building of these special improvements consumes the Great Person, removing them from the game.Technologies and Research  Civilization V comes with 74 technologies divided into seven eras, from Ancient Era to Future Era. In single-player games, the discovery of each tech is accompanied by a famous quotation from history that is voiced by William Morgan Sheppard. Although technology trading has been removed, a new feature was added: making a research agreement. Two civilizations at peace can form one for an initial investment in gold, and as long as the two civilizations remain at peace, the research agreement provides both of them with a research points boost after a set amount of turns. The amount of the research points equals half the median value of costs between the technologies available for this particular civilization. The amount of the research points could be increased with wonders and social policies. However, this can be used simply to make the other civilization spend money before declaring war. Even the AI is known to use this.Social Policies  In Civilization V there is the ability to adopt social policies through accumulated culture. There are ten separate trees of social policies, and filling out five of the ten rewards the player with Cultural victory. Instead of switching one policy with another, some policies build on others. Each policy has its own bonuses, such as starting a Golden Age. In Brave New World, there are also Ideologies - end-game uber Social Policies, which not only grant powerful bonuses, but also impact a civilization's standing in the world and its relations with other civilizations. Unlike Social Policies, Ideologies compete with each other on a world level.Victory Conditions  Once again, there are many ways to achieve victory other than military conquest. You can win by focusing mainly on scientific research and be the first to assemble a space ship to Alpha Centauri. Diplomatic victory requires help from other Civilizations and City-States in the United Nations and the World Congress in later expansions. Cultural victory now requires to complete five out of ten of the social policy \"trees\" and completing the Utopia Project or becoming influential over other civilizations with tourism in the Brave New World expansion. Obviously, World Domination is an option, but the victory condition has been simplified compared to the other games. Rather than completely destroying the other civilizations, the player who gains control of all capitals wins. You can also win by having the highest score at the year 2050 AD.Score  If no one wins the game by 2050 AD, then the game gives you a score based on: Your score is also used to determine your Ranking, which compares you to one of the following historical figures at the end of the game:Downloadable Content  There are multiple downloadable add-ons to Civilization V. This includes two expansion packs that add a massive amount of content including new civilizations, maps, scenarios, wonders, buildings, units, and gameplay elements. They are: Aside from the two expansion packs, several additional add-ons are available to add a few more contents. These include:DLC Bundles  Alternatively, some of the DLC packs can be purchased in bundles.Scenarios  Civilization V has multiple scenarios to play.

The Brave New World expansion added 20 new units, including the new Barbarian unique unit Hand-Axe. Note that many units are unique to certain civilizations; that is, they replace a certain generic unit and will only be available when you play with a certain civilization. They are marked as such, and appear under the heading of the generic unit they replace. Their general armament and thus their technological requirements are the same as that unit, but their resource requirements may differ - that is, some unique units can be produced without access to the strategic resources that their generic counterparts require.Civilian Units Religious Units Trade Units Great People Spaceship Parts Ancient Era Ranged Units Melee Units Naval Melee Units Naval Ranged Units Classical Era Ranged Units Siege Weapons Melee Units Mounted Units Medieval Era Ranged Units Siege Weapons Melee Units Mounted Units Naval Ranged Units Renaissance Era Siege Weapons Gunpowder Units Mounted Units Naval Melee Units Naval Ranged Units Industrial Era Ranged Units Siege Weapons Gunpowder Units Mounted Units Naval Melee Units Modern Era Ranged units Gunpowder Units Naval Melee Units Naval Ranged Units Armored Units Bomber Units Fighter Units Atomic Era Ranged Units Siege Weapons Gunpowder Units Armored Units Bomber Units Fighter Units Helicopter Units Bomb Units Information Era Gunpowder Units Naval Ranged Units Armored Units Bomber Units Fighter Units Bomb Units  Valid only in the Gods & Kings expansion pack.

Until 2010 it would be the latest installment of the acclaimed Civilization series. Civilization IV was released between October 25 and November 4, 2005 in North America, Europe, and Australia. The game's first expansion, Warlords, was released on July 24, 2006. The most recent expansion, Beyond the Sword, was released on July 23, 2007.Overview  Civilization IV is a turn-based game in which the player builds an empire from scratch. All standard full-length games begin in the Ancient Era (4000 BC) with a single Settler to build one's first city and a Scout or a Warrior, depending on a civ's starting technologies. From there, the player expands the empire while contending with rivals, utilizing the terrain, and developing technology. The player has several obstacles to face, modeled on political or economic problems faced by real-world nations. Apart from this they also have to handle their diplomatic relations with rivals and their continuing quest for exploration and new resources. Other important tasks include the planning of where to build new cities and progress in science which reveals access to new technologies. A player has the choice of playing the part of one of a number of historical figures such as Elizabeth I (England) to Mao Zedong (China). The scope of the game ranges from around 4000 BC to 2050 AD. Civilizations gradually advance in technology based on their own production of \"research\" and sometimes the work of Great People. Technologies range from writing and pottery through paper and gunpowder to genetic engineering and nuclear fusion. All technologies reveal new possibilities for a civilization and enable the chance to trade with other civilizations for military aid, gold, resources or other technologies. The concept of technological growth is based on a technology tree. Another important concept in the game, not present in the earliest games in the series, is the growth of culture, which expands one's cultural borders and can also cause one's culture to infiltrate into another civilization's, sometimes causing a city to rebel against its current owner. Culture is increased through the creation of World Wonders (which may have bonus effects), constructing certain buildings in cities, and the spreading of a number of religions (see below). The game can be won through conquest (conquering all other civilizations), domination (controlling a percentage of the world's land and population), the space race (being the first to construct a spaceship capable of colonizing Alpha Centauri), culture (increasing the cultural ratings of three different cities to \"legendary\" levels) and diplomacy (through votes in the United Nations). Finally, if the game's clock runs out (by default in the year 2050 AD), the nation with the highest composite score is declared the winner. Civilization IV was released in English, German, French, Spanish, and Italian. Fans have also made Russian and Finnish translations.Gameplay Diplomacy  Diplomacy in Civilization IV generally involves the trading of goods and forming strong alliances. Different trade options require different advancements to unlock, and some things may only be traded for certain other things (e.g., per turns deals must be compensated by another per turn deal). Players may trade technologies, resources (including luxuries such as wine), maps (to reveal information about the rest of the world) and gold. Advanced diplomacy options include the creation of trade embargoes, the promising of military aid, and the adoption of particular civics and/or a religion. The reasoning behind diplomacy is more transparent when compared to Civ3: the Diplomacy window now not only displays the other leaders' attitudes (gracious, friendly, pleased, cautious, annoyed, furious), but why they feel that way (e.g. \"-2: You refused to stop trading with our worst enemies!\"). When a leader is friendly or gracious towards one's civilization, they are more likely to accept deals without unfair bargaining. Another new feature is the new abilities of the United Nations. The United Nations wonder allows passing global resolutions (e.g. the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty) in addition to granting access to diplomatic victory. Unlike real-world resolutions, Civilization IV's resolutions are binding, except that in Beyond the Sword you have the option of defying resolutions.Combat  Units no longer have separate attack and defense values. Instead, they have a base strength that is increased or decreased depending on the situation. The unit's strength also affects how much damage it can do. Prior to the 1.52 patch, the unit's damage was calculated using its current strength (which also acts as life/hitpoints and changes accordingly). After the patch, the damage is calculated from the base strength - this means that badly damaged modern units can still easily win battles against obsolete units. Instead of generic increases in rank, individual units gain specific types of combat experience, such as bonuses against specific types of enemies or abilities like faster movement in forests. In total, there are 41 different types of combat promotions. It is also now possible for players to examine \"combat odds\" before attacking, giving the player a good sense as to whether a given attack will succeed or not, factoring in all the various bonuses and penalties associated with terrain, unit capabilities, and so forth. The 1.61 patch brought further changes, and now damaged units attack or defend with the average of their current and full strengths.Production and trade  The game features 32 types of resources, all of which are tradable and require an improvement (such as a mine or an oil well) to be utilized. Some resources are required for certain units, buildings, or wonders (iron, copper); some may double the production speed of a certain wonder (marble, stone); and some act as luxuries like in Civ III, providing either happiness or health to all cities connected to them (fur, dye, incense). There are also three types of culture goods provided by World Wonders, rather than resources, that can be traded: Hit Singles, Hit Movies and Hit Musicals. To trade goods or to send them to other cities within one's border, they must have some form of connection between the goods and the city. In the later game, this connection can be through ocean tiles, but in the early game, it is limited to roads and rivers. Cities on the same river are automatically connected for trading purposes, while cities on the same coastline are connected for trading purposes once the Sailing technology is researched. Production (also - as it was in Colonization - known as \"Hammers,\" the icon that represents it) is sometimes used as a resource-term on Civilization. Each tile provides a city with a certain amount of \"Hammers\" which collect up in the city to produce buildings and units. Unlike in Civilization III, the player is no longer able to transfer all production from one project to another, but all production on a certain project will remain. For example, if the player is building a temple but decides to switch to a harbor, production on the harbor will have to start from scratch. However, the temple stays in the building queue and retains its previous progress, aside from some decay over time. As an ancillary rule, if one culture is building a World Wonder but another empire completes it first, the losing culture is compensated with gold proportional to the amount of Production points lost.Religion  The concept of separate religions is new to Civilization IV. In previous games, players could build temples and cathedrals, but the religion was just a generic feature of happiness and culture. There are now seven distinct religions in the game: Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, and Taoism. There are no bonuses or traits specific to any religion, except that each religion is tied to a specific technological advance, and the four later religions (Christianity, Confucianism, Islam, and Taoism) begin with a free Missionary unit for reasons of game balance. Also, the respective cathedrals of each religion have different resources that aid in their construction, although are not necessary. If a player is the first to discover a certain religion on the tech tree, they can \"found\" the new religion; a city with no religion or the newest city in that civilization's empire becomes that religion's holy city. The player can then build Monasteries and train Missionaries to spread their religion(s) to other cities, both foreign and domestic. (Colonization also has missionaries, spreading their version of Christianity.) Religion factors into a number of existing game mechanics. Civs that share a common state religion will be friendly in their diplomatic dealings; conversely, civs with differing state religions will be hostile to each other. Securing an open-borders agreement, sending in missionaries and then encouraging the other civ to convert is a relatively painless way of encouraging international tranquility. The founding civ of a religion also receives an economic benefit: if that civ expends a Great Prophet at their religion's holy city, they will receive that religion's most sacred building (the Kashi Vishwanath, the Church of the Nativity, etc.), which provides a 1-gold-per-city tithe from every city hosting that religion. Finally, if a civ has 1) a state religion, 2) that religion's holy city and 3) that religion's sacred building, they will receive line-of-sight in every city hosting said religion, providing additional intelligence and a good way to keep an eye on foreign progress. Additionally, if one can gain an early diplomatic victory by building a Apostolic Palace, which also has the same features as a UN building, though nations can only be members if they have at least one city with the same religion as the Apostolic Palace (your state religion). The new civics model of government also has a strong effect on religion: players can found a state religion, declare religious freedom, or take other actions that have profound impacts on the religious lives of their subjects. If a civilization has no declared religion, they are exempt from all described bonuses and penalties.Civilizations and leaders  Eight of the eighteen civilizations have two leaders. Each leader offers bonuses based on what conditions were exceptional during the historical reign of that leader, and each leader acts as differently as if they were a separate civilization and have distinct personalities. Several historic figures not used in previous Civ games are AI leaders in Civ4, including: Asoka, Cyrus II, Franklin D. Roosevelt, George Washington, Hatshepsut, Mansa Musa, Kublai Khan, Peter the Great, Qin Shi Huang, Saladin (though Saladin was a hidden leader in Civ 2), and Queen Victoria. All civilizations have some element of uniqueness and all leaders have certain traits based on their achievements in real life. While these are limited, they have some effect on a player's game plan. All civilizations also have a unique unit which can be military (such as Persian Immortals) or economic (such as Indian Fast Workers). Below is a summary of each civilization's capital and unique features.Technologies  As in prior versions of Civilization, there are technologies for the civilizations to discover. There are a total of 85 technologies in the game, up from 80 in Civilization III. Technologies have many uses; they can be used for trade, for the construction of new buildings and wonders, for the founding of new religions, or for the development of new forms of government. To discover modern technologies, it is first necessary to discover the technologies that lead up to it (for example, democracy can only be discovered after the printing press). See List of technologies in Civ4 for complete list. See the full tech tree here. Technology development is flexible: certain technologies can be discovered in more than just one way. The game has a very useful tech tree, which can be accessed by pressing F6 on the keyboard. The tech tree displays all the techs in the game and their relations with one another. It is possible to select even unavailable techs for research. This will cause all the prerequisite techs to be researched in order. If multiple paths lead to the target tech, the civilization will pick the shortest. The final tech or group of techs, as in previous versions, are called \"Future Tech\", followed by a number. Instead of simply adding on to the final score, however, as in earlier games, each city receives a happiness and health bonus for each future tech discovered. In single-player games, the discovery of each tech during the game is accompanied by a famous quotation from history which is voiced by Leonard Nimoy of Star Trek fame. The sources of the quotes range from the Buddha, Charles Darwin, Brillat-Savarin, Steve Wozniak, Henry Ford, the Bible all the way to Lonnie Donegan, and Dan Quayle.Scoring system  In Civilization IV the leadership skills of players are compared to a subjective list of twenty of the best or worst leaders in history, similar to the list in Civilization I. The score is based on a number of factors, including military growth and success, technological advancement, construction of wonders and economic growth. It is shown at the end of the game. The released version of the game abandoned Civilization III's graded scale. In Civ3, a spectacular victory on the easiest difficulty would provide the player with only a middling score, and the best titles were only awarded to players attempting the hardest difficulties. The original Civ4, on the other hand, allows the player to obtain any score on any difficulty level. As of the v1.61 patch, the grading system has returned to the curved-by-difficulty scale.New features Gameplay  Many aspects of Civilization IV are new to the series (though some appear in spinoffs or Colonization). These include:Interface improvements Audio-visual Official maps and scenarios  Sid Meier's Civilization IV included some bonus content, released with mainly the purpose of showing modding capabilities:Customization  Civilization IV is much more open to modification than its predecessors. Game data and rules are stored in XML files, and a Software Development Kit was released in April 2006 to allow AI customization. Major parts of the interface, map generation, and scripted events are written entirely in Python and can be customised.World Builder  The World Builder allows a player to create a map from scratch, to use an in-game situation as a starting point for a new scenario, or to simply cheat by giving himself more units, gold, buildings, better relations with leaders, improvements, cultural borders, technologies, even take over other cities by placing a border there. The terrain can be altered, and resources, military units and cities on the map can be added, removed or modified. Additionally, each civilization's technological progress as well as its diplomatic and military ties to other civilizations can be edited. The World Builder for Civ IV is in-game, in contrast to previous Civilization games where the Map Editor was an external application. (In Civ2 one could modify anything using Cheat Mode.) World Builder can also be used to create an interesting experience. In custom game mode, the user must first turn all opposing civilizations off as well as all victory conditions. Barbarians must also be deactivated. In World Builder, the user can make it so that the player only starts with a settler with no starting technologies. This allows the user to progress through all technologies for a more expanded experience of the development of civilization.XML  More game attributes are stored in XML files, which must be edited with an external text editor or application. Barry Caudill, a senior producer at Firaxis Games, said [1] in September: At the current time the XML processing in Windows is more permissive of minor errors than in Mac OS X. As a result, some XML files which will work on the Windows version of the game need some slight tweaking before they function on the Macintosh version.Python  The game uses boost.python to allow the Python programming language access to many parts of the game (including the style and content of all interface screens). Python can also be used to modify random map generation and to add complex scripted events. The version of Python present in the Windows version of the game differs from the version in Mac OS X up to and including version 10.4.7, and as a result, while most Python files for the Windows version will work on the Macintosh version, not all will.Software Development Kit  The Civilization IV Software Development Kit was released on April 13 2006 to coincide with the release of the v1.61 patch. The kit allows players to view, modify, or completely re-write the game's DLL source code, enabling the modification of the game's AI and other integral parts of the game. [2] As of the first official patch for the Macintosh version (v1.61 Revision A), there is no SDK for the Macintosh version of the game. In fact the Macintosh version lacks the separate library of game related code which the PC version uses, but instead includes the code compiled into the main executable. There is as of yet no indication of whether this will change in a future patch.Launch problems  The release of Civilization IV did not go smoothly. Technical, production and shipping problems marred its product cycle. Despite all of these problems, many newer computers run Civilization IV quite smoothly. The headache caused by the need to cater to many different computer configurations has caused lead designer Soren Johnson to state that he seriously considers focusing on console development. [9]Patches Expansions Platforms  Civilization IV is available for two different platforms currently, Windows (PC) and Macintosh. The Macintosh version is published by Aspyr and was released in June 2006. Though it lacks some of the customization features which were added to the PC version in v1.61 and lacks support for the GameSpy internet gaming system, instead being compatible with the Mac specific GameRanger, it is otherwise identical to v.1.61 of the PC version. The game was released as a Universal binary, running on both x86 and PPC based Macintoshes. Multiplayer games involving both versions of the game work, but require the use of one of the multiplayer options other than \"Internet Play\" due to the incompatible formats used by the two platforms.Critics' scores Awards Trivia References Recent retail prices New Zealand United States The Netherlands See also External links Official sites Publisher-recommended third-party sites Other material Civilization V: Gods & Kings  Back to Civilization V Sid Meier's Civilization\u00ae V: Gods & Kings is the first expansion pack released for Civilization V. It was released June 19, 2012 in North America and June 22, 2012 worldwide. As the name shows, the expansion focuses on a brand new feature - Religion, which adds a whole new level of development for a civilization. Although it doesn't lead to a separate victory, Religion offers a complete new system of bonuses for a nation, allowing it to enrich its abilities in many new ways. The system also introduces an exciting layer of peaceful competition, as different religions strive to gain the hearts of the citizens. Another new feature is Espionage, which adds the opportunity to conduct industrial and military spying in other nations, or conduct secret operations in City-States. Gods & Kings includes an overhaul of the combat system, redesigned for longer, more tactical battles and more balanced military advancement through the ages. The technology tree has also been redesigned, balancing the number of techs in all Eras and splitting the last Era in two for a more exciting endgame. The expansion also includes 2 new City-State types - Religious and Mercantile, and many new City-States. It also introduces 9 new civilizations and leaders, 9 new wonders, 27 new units, 13 new buildings, and new resources and technologies.New content Civilizations and leaders Technologies Luxury resources Units  In addition to the unique units of the new civilizations, the following units are introduced in Gods & Kings:Buildings Wonders World Wonders National Wonders Natural Wonders Religion  Religion involves gaining faith from your people. This can be done in a few different ways, including constructing certain buildings and wonders, being successful at combat, discovering ancient ruins, and from a Religious City-State. Gaining enough faith will allow for you to build a Pantheon. You can choose from a whole list of Pantheons, each representing a different ancient Belief which comes with a certain benefit. Eventually after you've built your Pantheon, you can found a religion by spawning a new type of great person, the Great prophet. You can then choose from another list of Beliefs which will form your Religion. After that, your religion will start spreading through the world and compete with the other religion for the hearts and souls of the people, a mission which can help you immensely in achieving any type of victory.Espionage  Espionage can be used in multiple ways. Like in\u00a0Civ4, Spies can steal techs from other Civs, but they are not a unit on the map that you can build. Espionage is unlocked when the Renaissance era is reached, this will unlock 1 spy for every age after, an additional spy may be gained from building the National Intelligence Agency National Wonder. When stationed in your cities, spies perform counter-intelligence to prevent other spies from stealing your technologies. Another way to use them is to send a spy into a city-state to rig an election, increasing your influence and decreasing the influence of other civilizations. Spies can also be used to stage a Coup in city-states, a risky move with big payouts if successful. Spies can also be used to gain information on what opposing civilizations will be doing next. If a Spy is caught while stealing technology, they will be killed, and a new, inexperienced Spy will eventually replace them.City-States  The two new City-State types are Religious and Mercantile. Religious City-States reward additional Faith, while Mercantile City-States reward their friends with happiness and custom luxury goods which can vary depending on the City-State. These luxury resources can only be obtained from the Mercantile City-States, giving the world's strongest armies a valid reason to make a few friends rather than to just pillage their way across the continents (or pangaea).Combat  Combat has moved from a 10-point system to a 100-point system. This allows for a slower and more flexible system. Additionally, Naval Combat has expanded to include both ranged and melee units. Melee naval units can conduct raids and pillages on coastal cities to get gold and, if the city is weak enough, capture it.Scenarios  Gods & Kings also includes three new scenarios:\"Civil War\" Scenario  If one looks inside the files for Gods & Kings, they can find many unused files that likely would've been used in a Civil War scenario between the northern and southern states of the U.S. Some of these files include: The Civil War Scenario was not added with Gods & Kings, but it is now available with the Brave New World expansion.Civilizations (Civ5)  Back to Civilization V\n\n Go to the list of leaders A civilization is a specific historical nation, which represents a player in the game. Each player adopts a single civilization at the setup of each game.Civilization Unique Features  Besides the name, history and leader, every civilization has a set of unique features which set it apart from the others and give it particular advantages These features are:List of Civilizations  There are a total of 43 civilizations available in\u00a0Civilization V, including DLCs and the expansions. It is also the first incarnation of the series where the leaders speak their native languages. \u2020 Available as DLCs: Valid only in the Gods & Kings expansion pack. Valid only in the Brave New World expansion pack.See also List of wonders in Civ5  Back to Civilization V\n\n Back to Game concepts\n\n List of natural wonders\n List of buildings\n Main Building article A Wonder is a mega-building, which may be unique in the world, and provides exceptional bonuses. All Wonders are inspired by real-world buildings and landmarks. Note that the effect of each wonder only applies to the civilization controlling the city where it is built; also, many Wonders have on-build effects which won't activate again if another civilization captures their city.\u00a0 Besides their main unique bonuses, most Wonders produce additional benefits such as \u00a0Gold or \u00a0Faith, and all of them produce at least 1 \u00a0Culture. All of these stat bonuses apply directly to the city where the Wonder is built (if applicable). Also, most Wonders produce Great People Points of some kind - check their info blocks for the details. This page lists all World and National Wonders available in Civilization V, as well as Projects. In Brave New World, some of the wonders\u00a0can\u00a0now be built only after adopting a certain policy tree or ideology. For example, to build the Forbidden Palace, the Patronage policy tree must have been started.World Wonders  Only one of these can exist in the world. If multiple civilizations would complete building it on the same turn, whichever has the most excess production will get the wonder.Ancient Era Classical Era Medieval Era Renaissance Era Industrial Era Modern Era Atomic Era Information Era Other National Wonders  These are special wonders which can only be built once a certain building has been built in all cities the civilization controls directly (that is, excluding Puppet cities). Only one of these can exist in a single civilization, but each civilization can build one for itself (so, there is no competition here). Note that the Palace cannot be built: it is automatically built when a civilization's first city is founded. The Grand Temple must be built in a Holy City.Guilds  In Brave New World, three guilds were introduced. They are actually a mix between a building and a national wonder, in that they don't need a prerequisite building in every city, but only one of each can exist in a single civilization. Since they're the only means for producing Great Writers, Great Artists and Great Musicians, the urgency of their building will depend on a civilization's victory strategy.Projects  These late-game projects grant a civilization a powerful ability once finished. They cannot be rushed using Great Engineers (except for spaceship parts if a civilization is using the Order Ideology).International Projects  These projects are a new feature in Brave New World. Unlike normal projects, they may only be proposed during the World Congress. If the proposition passes, the projects can be undertaken by all civilizations simultaneously. Each International Project grants prizes depending on how much the civilization was involved, based upon the Production contributed towards the project. Only the civilization that contributed the highest amount of production will get the first prize, whereas every civilization that contributed the stated amount or above will get second and third prizes. Each project may be undertaken/completed only once.Unused Wonders  Valid only in the Gods & Kings expansion pack.

They act as a system of gameplay bonuses, activated little by little as your empire develops its  Culture. Some of these bonuses are empire-wide (meaning they act on all cities and empire components at the same time), while others are related to particular buildings, units, or even Great People. Many Social Policies enhance individual buildings' functions - check the list of buildings for more info on that. All policies are organised into trees, and each tree has to be unlocked before the specific policies in it can be adopted. The policies within each tree are further organized into branches, requiring that lower-level policies be adopted before higher-level ones become available. Unlocking a policy tree also activates a special bonus, as does adopting all five policies in it. For more information on the exact process of adopting policies, as well as for different strategies concerning Social Policies, check the Social strategy article. With the addition of the Gods & Kings expansion, the new Religion system also plays part in social politics. The Piety tree has been redesigned to benefit Religion as well as Culture, and as a reward for completing many branches, the player can spend  Faith to purchase certain Great People starting in the Industrial Era. Also, once the Industrial Era comes around, a player's choice of social policies can now drastically impact its standings with another civilization. Civilizations that choose the same Industrial Era policy track (Order, Autocracy, or Freedom) will become friendlier, while civilizations with different policy tracks will become more hostile.In the Brave New World expansion, the social policies have been updated, with the inclusion of the Aesthetics and Exploration policy trees. Also, Piety can now be adopted right from the Ancient Era, while the next trees all unlock an Era earlier, giving the player a wider choice for development in the early game. No Policy trees are mutually exclusive anymore, and the Anarchy concept has been reserved for when you switch Ideology. Order, Autocracy, and Freedom have been excluded as Social policies, but one of these can be adopted as an Ideology once you build three Factories or reach the Modern Era. Even more than in Gods & Kings, a player's choice of Ideology can drastically impact his or her standings with another civilization. Finally, note that some World Wonders are now linked to Social Policy trees (for example, the Pyramids are linked to the Liberty tree) - now they can only be built if the relevant tree has been unlocked, AND you have researched the necessary technology.Tradition  Back to the policy tree The Tradition tree is available right from the Ancient Era. Choosing this policy first will give you the honorific \"Lord\" for male leaders and \"Lady\" for female leaders. Adopting Tradition greatly increases the rate of border expansion (25%) in cities (by diminishing the accumulated  Culture needed for successive new tiles) and also grants +3  Culture in the  Capital. Unlocks building the Hanging Gardens wonder. Adopting all Policies in the Tradition tree will grant +15%  Growth in all cities and +2  Food in each citya free Aqueduct in your first four citiesa free Aqueduct in your first four cities. It also allows the purchase of Great Engineers with  Faith starting in Industrial Era.Liberty  Back to the policy tree The Liberty tree is available right from the Ancient Era. Choosing this policy first will give you the honorific \"Consul\". Note that in the expansions, the order of Republic and Collective Rule was switched, although their bonuses remain the same. Adopting Liberty will provide +1  Culture in every city. Unlocks building the Pyramids wonder. Adopting all policies in the Liberty tree will grant a free Great Person of your choice near the  Capital.Honor  Back to the policy tree The Honor tree is available right from the Ancient Era. Choosing this policy first will give you the honorific \"The Great\". Adopting Honor gives a +25%+33%+33% combat bonus against Barbarians; from now on notifications will be provided when new Barbarian Encampments spawn in revealed territory. Gain  Culture for the empire from each barbarian unit killed. (The  Culture earned is equal to the  Combat Strength or  Ranged Combat Strength of the defeated unit, whichever is greater.) Unlocks building the Statue of Zeus wonder. Adopting all policies in the Honor tree will grant  Gold for each enemy unit killed. (Note that this applies only to units killed directly by your actions. For example, you won't receive  Gold for a unit killed by the effect of a Citadel.)  It also allows the purchase of Great Generals with  Faith starting from the Industrial Era.Piety  Back to the policy tree The Piety tree becomes available during the Classical Era.

The info in this article may not be fully accurate or complete. If nobody has edited it in the past week, check the page history and ask whether the last editor is still planning to add more. Civilization IV: Beyond the Sword is the second official expansion pack of the critically-acclaimed turn-based strategy video game Civilization IV. It was released in July, 2007. The expansion focuses on adding content to the in-game time periods following the invention of gunpowder, and includes more general content such as 11 new scenarios, 10 new civilizations, and 16 new leaders.Features Overview Corporations  Corporations become available with discovery of the Corporation technology. Each of the seven available Corporations requires a particular type of Great Person, a particular additional technology, and access to particular resources to build the Corporate Headquarters and found that Corporation; each of the seven Corporations can be founded only once per game. Each Corporation consumes specific resources, and supplies alternate resources or benefits in return. The more instances of resources they consume, the more food, production, commerce, or resources they supply. Corporations can be spread like religions (using the Executive unit as a missionary) to other cities, including foreign cities, so long as they have access to at least one resource particular to that corporation; any city hosting a Corporation branch must pay a maintenance fee for its services, but the owner of the Corporate Headquarters receives bonus gold for each branch. Players can block foreign corporations from operating in their cities by adopting the Mercantilism civic, and they can block all corporations, even their own, by adopting the State Property civic. The Corporations are not directly based on real-life corporations, unlike Religions; however, some of the options are clear references to real companies such as General Mills or Standard Oil. Currently, the following seven Corporations appear in the game:Espionage  Espionage's importance in Civilization IV has been raised to compare with that of scientific research, culture, income from taxes, etc. The new espionage slider allows the player to divert part of their income towards espionage activities against other civilizations. Once the player has reached certain thresholds of espionage investment, the player starts gaining some automatic intelligence benefits over rival civilizations. The player can also send Spy units into foreign territory to gather further intelligence and to perform various missions of destruction and propaganda. Their role is a bit different, because spies are now invisible to all units, save for other spies.Great Spies are born in cities, like other Great Persons. Great Spies can perform typical functions like serving as a Specialist, starting a Golden Age, or building a unique building. Their special function allows them to infiltrate into enemy cities, giving the player significant advantage in espionage against that civilization. Just like other Great Persons, they have unique names, and their appearance changes accordingly to the time period, e.g., a Great Spy in the ancient era shows up as a ninja, just as the Industrial-Age Great Spy appears as a tuxedo-sporting James Bond-style unit, complete with similar thematic music once a mission is performed.Random Events  The Beyond the Sword expansion reintroduces SimCity- and Alpha Centauri-style random events from the original Civilization game, which can cause the game to swing in the player's favor or present another obstacle the player must overcome. There are more than 100 of these events, including natural disasters, such as earthquakes that can destroy buildings, and diplomatic marriages that might suddenly turn two former rivals into friends. Together these new events give each game a completely unique flavor. In addition, each game offers players the opportunity for rewards through the completion of special events in the form of missions (\"quests\"). Some examples of Random Events in the game include:Advanced Starts  Advanced Starts are a pre-game setup phase players use to purchase cities, improvements, buildings, technologies, and units. It works in both single-player and multiplayer. The player decides what to purchase and where to place it. When everyone is done, the game starts with players controlling relatively balanced, advanced empires with a working infrastructure. This mechanism is ideal for those who want to jump right in and experience a balanced game in a further era, without having to start it from the stone age.Expanded Space Victory  To achieve a Space Victory, the game now requires the player's spaceship to reach Alpha Centauri, rather than simply launch. It is now also possible to build spaceships that fly faster than those of other civilizations, so that a player can achieve Space Victory, even if they finished building a spaceship after a competitor. It is also once again possible to end a rival's space program by capturing his capital city.Expanded Diplomatic Victory  The new Apostolic Palace wonder allows the player to win an early diplomatic victory, centuries before the United Nations is due to make its appearance. The wonder is tied to the state religion of the player who built it. Depending on the influence of the Palace's religion on their civilization, players get votes to cast on decrees like holy wars, trade embargoes, or peace enforcement. It is later rebuffed by Communism and made obsolete by Mass Media. At this point, the more modern United Nations takes over many of its functions.New Game Options  The expansion offers various new world-types and game options. The player will have the option to play as any leader-civilization combination, therefore allowing \"what-if\" possibilities. Also, a new feature is the option to only trade away player researched technologies. Finally players can choose the religions founded by specific technologies, so that the same religions will not be dominant in every game.New Content  New content includes:General Changes  The game may run extremely slowly under Windows Vista, even with dual-core high speed processors. Several minutes or more may elapse between turns in some cases, especially when playing scenarios.New Civilizations  Civilization IV: Beyond the Sword features 10 new civilizations:New Leaders  There are 6 new leaders in Civilization IV: Beyond the Sword for pre-existing civilizations.Existing Leaders  For the Beyond the Sword expansion pack, the traits of certain leaders were changed:New Scenarios  The expansion delivered 11 new scenarios, some developed by the fan community. The following scenarios are included. This single player scenario was designed by Firaxis' Tim McCracken featuring a Science fiction/Horror/Role Playing Game theme where a team of \"Gravebringers\" are sent to a world inhabited by human robots to retrieve research. In this squad based tactical scenario the player must fight against zombies and the undead. Besides being an X-Com styled thriller, this scenario is unusual in that it does not contain many defining aspects of Civilization like leaders, cities or technologies. In addition, if any of their gravebringers die, the player loses. Russia is divided, and a civil war is coming. To unite the Motherland the player may purchase military units from the U.S. or promotion upgrades from the Chinese Black Market; conscript the Russian people or bribe enemy forces; or even deploy the ultimate in doomsday weaponry, the nuclear bomb. This scenario is based on the wars fought by Frankish king and later emperor Charlemagne in Europe during the late eighth and early ninth centuries. In the Charlemagne's Wars scenario, units outside friendly borders will not heal without supply trains following them along. These defenseless units will have to be protected if the player wants to continue the advance against the Saracens. The Supply Train is a new unit for this scenario only that will heal troops in enemy territory. In CIV Defense, Civilization IV becomes a single player tower defense in which players start with a small amount of cash to buy an advanced start and to get a single city going before the game starts. At that point, the player is confronted with a wave of enemies who are hellbent on capturing the cities. After weathering each new wave of attacks, the player is rewarded with additional gold for each city that survives. In the Buy phase he then acquires new units, new cities and new technologies before the next wave of attackers comes. This pattern continues and gets more and more difficult over the course of twenty waves. Once the player has survived them all, he/she is declared the winner. A late medieval age scenario where the player carves out a fortune from the riches of fourteenth-century Africa, Arabia, and Persia. Victory is achieved by trading, betraying, and battling one's way towards control of the Crossroads of the World. A plot-heavy scenario set in the world of Erebus, home of the popular Fall from Heaven public mod and made in cooperation with Firaxis staff and members of the mod team. The scenario begins 350 years into the Age of Ice. Mulcarn, the God of Winter, reigns and the world is little more than a frozen wasteland ravaged by blizzards. Mankind has lost the knowledge gained during the previous age and has broken into small tribes fighting for survival. The player controls Kylorin, an ageless hero, as he tries to gather several tribes into a force capable of standing against Mulcarn. To do that, the pieces of a legendary sword, the Godslayer, have to be found and numerous threats have to be overcome. These threats could be creatures that roam the wilderness, enemy civilizations or the power of Mulcarn himself. If the player reforges the Godslayer and takes it into battle against Mulcarn he can win the scenario and end the Age of Ice. The Final Frontier space scenario adapts Civilization into space with a brand new tech tree, units and terrain. The sides are different extrasolar colonies that have now lost contact with Earth. Over the course of the scenario, clues about what happened to humanity's home planet are revealed. The focus is not on building cities, but colonizing entire star systems. Some of the new terrain tiles are space radiation, black holes, a nebula, asteroids, damage zone, and supernova. Gods of Old is the standard game, based on principles of Mesopotamian religion. Each of the seven Ancient Mesopotamian gods in the game has a special ability and can unleash calamities such as earthquakes and floods. A futuristic sci-fi scenario with clone armies and mechanized units set in the 2050s. This scenario is available as an expansion on the Epic game as well as being a standalone scenario. The setup of the map at the beginning of the scenario is similar to the world in Nineteen Eighty-Four with America Inc. as Oceania, Europa as Eurasia, Asia as Eastasia, and The Southern Empire as the war zones. Another improved and updated favorite among fans' mods for Civilization IV that revolves around the re-enacting history on Earth, guiding your game in through an alternative, but still realistic history, unique every game you play.\n The most important concept behind the mod is that civilizations don't start all at the beginning of the game, but appear at different times. For instance, picking the Arabs, the game will autoplay until 620 AD, when the player will take control and find a world that may have developed in an unpredictable way.\n Dynamic rise and fall of civilizations, stability management (unstable empires will risk secessions and civil wars), plague, world congresses, customized AI, unique civilization powers and world wars are the most prominent and innovative features of this mod.\n Rhye's and Fall of Civilization was defined \"one of the most exciting and robust mods you'll ever see for any game\" in Yahoo! Games review, and \"a fresh new coat of paint to the core Civilization gameplay\" in the GameSpot one. French magazine Cyberstrat\u00e8ge reckoned it the best of the scenarios released in Beyond the Sword, assigning the best mark (9 of out 10) among them. Play as the Allies or Axis in the European Theater starting in either 1936 or 1939 or the Pacific Theater starting in 1936 of the Second World WarNew World Wonders  New wonders feature in the game:New National Wonders New Buildings New Units New Promotions New Technologies  These new technologies unique to the Beyond the Sword expansion are narrated by Sid Meier; the technologies from the original Civilization IV are still voiced by Leonard Nimoy.Game Errors See also External Links Resources (Civ5)  Back to Civilization V\n Back to Game concepts\n Go to the list of improvementsBasics  Resources are special commodities found in limited quantities on the map. When a resource is \"worked\" (or accessed), it provides a bonus for your empire; this is accomplished either through constructing a specific improvement with a Worker (on land) or expending a Work Boat (for sea tiles). Bonuses vary from increased yield (production, food, etc.) to a number of units of Iron, Uranium, Gold or some other strategic or luxury resources necessary for producing specific units and buildings, and for providing more happiness to your citizens. Resources are extremely important in the game, and the main reason for expansion and territorial wars. Plan your early expansion carefully to take control of as many resources as you can!\u00a0 Civilization V contains three kinds of resources: bonus resources, strategic resources and luxury resources. This article explains their differences and lists the resources of each category. Of the three types of resources, bonus resources are the most common, providing only tile yield benefits. Strategic and luxury resources' effects, on the other hand, are much more far-reaching, and are sufficiently precious to be traded across empires (besides having tile yield benefits). For this purpose, all of them are counted in units across your empire (regardless of their source location). To gain strategic access to, and add the count of a particular strategic or luxury resource to your trade network, you need not only to have it in your territory, but also to construct a particular improvement on it. You don't need to work its tile to have access to its strategic and trading benefits! You do, however, need to work it to access its tile benefits. Finally, the utilisation of strategic resources depends highly on technological development. While the use of resources like Spices and Wine is apparent from the dawn of ages, this is not true for the use of Uranium, for example. Because of that, Strategic resources don't even appear on the map before you research the necessary technology to make use of them! These technologies are widely spread across the eras, starting in the Ancient Era with Animal Husbandry (which reveals the use of Horses), and ending in the Atomic Era with Atomic Theory (which reveals the use of Uranium). Likewise, early strategic resources such as Iron or Horses may become less useful towards the end of the game. These changes and the discovery of more and more useful resources makes for a dynamic game and may force you to expand, conquer, or negotiate in locations you never thought would be useful before.Bonus Resources  These resources are the most widespread resources on the map. They aren't special in any strategic sense, and are thus not shared across your empire and neither can they be traded. However, they provide substantial additional output for the tile they are on when worked, especially when improved. Since their benefit lies only in their tile output bonus, it only makes sense to use a bonus resource by having a city sufficiently close to it (within three tiles), which can then work its tile. Also, several special buildings can be constructed in the controlling city to further increase bonus resources yields. These are the buildings which increase bonus resources' output:Strategic Resources  Strategic resources are those that are of economic and military importance for your empire. Certain military units and buildings require a strategic resource before they can be built. For example, a Horseman requires 1  Horses resource, while a Factory requires 1  Coal resource. If these objects are removed from a civilization's control - whether by losing a unit in battle, gifting it to a City-State, or by any other means - the strategic resource consumed by the object is released for future use. Strategic resources never actually leave play. If a civilization loses access to some of the strategic resources they are currently using, and find themselves using more than they're producing or trading, then military units depending upon the resource in question will fight with a large combat penalty until the situation is remedied. Each improved strategic resource tile provides a certain quantity (varying from one resource to the other, and also from one source to the other) of that resource to the empire that controls it, regardless of whether it is worked by a city or not. Note that they also provide output bonuses, which are useful\u00a0only\u00a0if the tile IS worked. Unused strategic resources may be traded to other empires. The Stable building provides +1 additional  Production from each Horses resource.\nThe\u00a0Forge building provides +1 additional  Production from each Iron resource.Luxury Resources  Luxury resources are fancy goods that everyone values highly, but your wealthier citizens especially relish (and often clamour for). They are the most diverse of all resources, and are used in all sorts of human activities - cooking, weaving, and in many other crafts. Their practical effect is to provide additional \u00a0Happiness - on a Standard map, +4 per each type of resource of which your empire has at least one count. Unlike strategic resources, each improved luxury resource tile provides only one count of it. If an empire possesses more than one count of the same luxury resource, the happiness effect is the same as possessing only one, so you should use the extra counts to trade with other empires. Again, you don't need to work an improved luxury resource tile in order to gain the resource, but you DO need to work it to gain its output bonuses. Unlike other resources, Luxury resources add  Gold yield to tiles, which makes them even more important strategically, allowing you to gain  Gold directly from terrain (and not having to trade for it). Note that luxury resources may be traded to other empires, if they're produced by YOU. However, in the event that you've gained them via trading or from a City-State, you can't trade them away. \u2020\u00a0Marble provides +15% Wonder production for Ancient and Classical Wonders\n * Unique to Mercantile City-States\n ** Unique to Indonesia, only obtainable through the Spice Islanders unique ability Some buildings also increase the bonuses of luxury resources: Introduced in Gods & Kings.\n Introduced in Brave New World.Strategy  Settling a city on top of a luxury or strategic resource tile gives the strategic benefits as soon as you have the appropriate technology for improving it. It also gives additional production, food and gold it usually provides right to your city tile, meaning that you'll always be using these benefits (since the city tile is always worked). You won't be able to use the potential benefits of Improvements built on the resource, but you WILL be able to build the bonus city buildings related to the resource and their bonus will apply. For example, with a city settled on a Stone resource, the Stone Works building is available (and it is expected that the city tile's  Production yield will increase accordingly after it is constructed). However the city will not gain the additional 1 or 2  Production (and possible  Faith from Stone Circles pantheon belief) associated with a Quarry. City-States allied to you give your empire free units of the resources they have. Note that these units are added to your pool for internal use, but are not available for trade with other civilizations!Interaction with Great tile improvements  Great People create incredible tile Improvements, with strong yields. Generally it would not advantageous to forgo their yield and replace these Improvements with standard Resource Improvements, and as a result, these special improvements will connect any revealed and future strategic resources on them to the trading network as a courtesy. Unlike cities, Great tile improvements do not connect luxury resources! However, Mines and Pasture resource improvements, the two main Improvements placed on strategic resources, get two further bonuses when adding up yield (on top of the resource's bonus yield and the improvement's own yield). The first is based on the resource they improve and the second is based on later technologies. Great tile improvements do not receive these additional bonus yields, unlike resource improvements. As an example, consider some coal resources on hills in the Modern Era: Therefore, intentionally placing an Great Tile Improvement on a strategic resource can be a waste of yields. However, there may be situations where it is advantageous to connect the resource with an Great improvement, such as obtaining Iron or Horses to rush units into production. Furthermore, resource-dependent yields only appear on later strategic resources such as Uranium and Oil that are revealed much later. Generally A) workers are more readily available and a few turns of construction is less consequential and B) Great People have already been spent by this point and the choice to avoid the resource will already have been 'made'. Hence while a good exercise in understanding the process of calculating and understanding tile yields, the distinction between the types of improvements tends to be more academic in nature, and have less practical applications than it may appear.List of buildings in Civ5  Back to Civilization V\n\n Back to Game concepts\n\n Main Building article\n List of improvements This is the list of buildings in Civ5, as of the Brave New World expansion. The Gods & Kings expansion added 13 new buildings to the game. The Brave New World expansion added 8 new buildings to the game, and removed one old building. The Fall 2013 patch also included one new building. Note that certain buildings are unique to certain civilizations and replace a generic building of that era. They are marked as such, and appear under the heading of the generic building they replace. See also the Notes section to see which civilization the unique building belongs to. These buildings have the same technological requirements as the generic building they replace, but sometimes their other requirements are different. Their unique bonuses are marked in green.\u00a0Religious  Religious buildings were introduced in the Gods & Kings expansion pack and may only be purchased through  Faith. These buildings include the updated version of the Monastery, previously a bonus building that can only be built in a city with Incense or Wine resources nearby. Cost is relative - It assumes a standard speed game, and increases as you progress through the ages.Information Era  Valid only in the Gods & Kings expansion pack. Valid only in the Brave New World expansion pack.Danish (Civ5)  Back to the list of civilizations The Danish people (or Danes) represent a DLC civilization for Civilization V that was released in May 2011 along with the 1066: Year of Viking Destiny scenario. Like the Polynesians, they have a unique sprite for their embarked units. The preferred religion for Denmark in Brave New World is supposed to be Protestantism. However, since it is a DLC civilization, no updates were made to Denmark.Strategy  The unique ability of the Danes makes them very well suited to a domination victory. Unlocking the ability to embark units with the discovery of Optics is critical, as this will grant you the power to perform quick coastal raids. The Danish ability to pillage tile improvements without using a movement point allows them to quickly demolish their opponents' infrastructure and heal themselves. Taken together, the Danish player has the ability to make lightning-quick strikes from the sea, tearing down enemy territory. With the discovery of Metal Casting and unlocking of the Berserker, the Danes become even more dangerous from the water, as well as getting their unit earlier than other civs, giving an especially early advantage. Though more specialized, the Norwegian Ski Infantry maintain this pattern of increased mobility and can be used to great effect in their preferred territories. Danish players should focus on developing social policies, religious beliefs, and ideological tenets that promote the growth of their military. They should also build a large number of Berserkers when available and try to keep them alive until they can be upgraded to Norwegian Ski Infantry, as the combined abilities of the two unique units result in extremely mobile late-game infantry forces that can cross most forms of rough terrain quickly. Paratroopers are also an unexpectedly interesting addition to the Danish arsenal. The airdrop ability does not verify if the Paratrooper has moved since the beginning of the round; rather, it verifies whether the unit has at least 2 movement points left. Normally these two checks are equivalent - not so for Danes. If you park a Paratrooper on a coastal tile and move him to land at the start of the round, that's 5 (6-1) movement points left, which means you can airdrop the unit across half the map, if your territory reaches that far.Civilopedia Entry History  Nestled among the Nordic countries of Northern Europe, the Kingdom of Denmark encompasses the country of Denmark proper, Greenland and the Faroe Islands. Former colonies were Christiansborg, Ada and Keta in the 18th to early 19th century on the gold coast of Africa also another former\u00a0 colony was the Virgin Islands till the year 1917 after that they were sold to the United States and\u00a0 United Kingdom countries. The oldest kingdoms in the world, early records of Denmark's history can be traced back to the 6th and 7th centuries AD, when the Danes were still a tribal people scattered across the region. Eventually united under the rule of King Harald Bluetooth, many Danes would also settle in England and Ireland during the invasions of the Viking Age. From these early tales of Viking exploration and conquest, to the modern nation of Denmark we know today, the Danish people have been at the forefront of global events for centuries.Geography and Climate  Denmark is a relatively small nation (roughly half the size of the U.S. state of Maine) located in Northern Europe. Along with the neighboring countries of Norway and Sweden, Denmark is part of the region known as Scandinavia. Although consisting primarily of several hundred small islands, the peninsula of Jutland, Denmark's mainland body, shares its southern border with Germany, making it the only Scandinavian country with a direct connection to the European mainland. Denmark is a notably flat country, its highest elevation being only 560 feet (171 m) above sea level. As part of the temperate zone, both the summer and winter months are relatively moderate with little in the way of extreme temperatures or precipitation.Early History and Origins  During the last Ice Age, the area that today constitutes Denmark was almost entirely covered by glacial formations. When the ice finally started to recede sometime around 12,000-14,000 BC, small groups of hunter-gatherers began to inhabit the area, surviving primarily by hunting reindeer. These hunters lived a nomadic lifestyle, moving with the seasons and following the migratory patterns of the animals they relied on for survival. Over time, the population of the small island region would continue to grow as immigrants moved north, bringing with them an increased knowledge of agriculture. As early as 3,000 BC, farmers began to clear portions of the large deciduous forests found throughout Denmark, as evidenced by the many flint-stone axes unearthed in modern times throughout the country. The custom of building \"Dolmens,\" a form of tomb, and eventually \"Passage Graves,\" also became prevalent around this time. The dolmen was a burial tomb consisting of several upright stones covered across the top with another large stone. These early burial tombs evolved into the Passage Grave, a megalithic structure consisting of a narrow entry lined with large stones, leading to a burial chamber covered in earth or additional stones. It's speculated that these megalithic tombs took entire communities years to construct, but having discovered examples that contained no human remains, archaeologists are still unsure of their true purpose. During the Nordic Bronze Age, these tombs further evolved into the \"Tumulus,\" or burial mounds, commonly associated with the Vikings today. It was also during this period that the battle axe, legendary weapon of the Vikings, progressed from its Stone Age roots into early bronze renditions. Although Denmark had little in the way of copper resources to allow the creation of bronze, large quantities still made their way north via trade and conquest, allowing the Danes to master the art of metalsmithing. By the 8th century AD, iron was readily available, and the Vikings were well-equipped with their historic weapon of choice.Age of Vikings  Beginning in the late 8th century, each spring the Vikings of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden would conduct the raids across the North Sea into England, eventually striking into France, Spain, and points east. In 793, the infamous Viking raid on Lindisfarne, a Christian monastery just off the English coast, would serve as an eye-opener to Western Europe and historically marks the unofficial dawn of the Viking Age. The legendary Viking Ragnar Lodbrok, who sailed the river Seine in 845 and threatened the destruction of Paris, only to be paid a ransom of 7,000 Ibs of silver instead, would solidify the Vikings place in history as the unrelenting scourge of Europe through the 11th century. Ragnar's alleged propensity for sacrificing captured prisoners to the Norse gods would terrify the Christian sensibilities of the European royalty, leading to increasingly larger payouts (known as \"Danegeld\") to appease the Vikings. The key to the Vikings success during their infamous raids was the Scandinavians' prowess in ship building. Already known for their fearless mastery of the seas, the construction of the \"Langskib,\" or Viking Longship, gave the Vikings a previously unheard of advantage during this period. While relying on conventional sails when moving on the open seas, the Vikings could quickly revert to using the oars for added maneuverability when moving near the coastline or on rivers. This versatility would prove to be the undoing of many European coastal settlements.Formation of the Kingdom  King Gorm the Old would lay the groundwork for the Kingdom of Denmark beginning in c. 936 AD, ruling until his death in 958. However, it was his son, Harald Bluetooth, who would be the first to unite all of Denmark under one rule, expanding the kingdom's grasp into parts of Norway and Sweden. Bluetooth would become a strong proponent for the conversion of the Danish people to Christianity, a process that would continue under future kings, particularly Canute the Great and Sweyn II. Canute (also known as Cnut, or Knud in Danish), ruled from 1016 until his death in 1035, and at one point would serve as King of England, Denmark, Norway and even parts of Sweden. His reign over England would prove to be pivotal, during which time monks from England were sent to Denmark to help further establish Christianity. As reparations to the Church, Canute ordered all of the English churches and monasteries destroyed or damaged by the Vikings in the past to be repaired, going so far as to repay the wealth plundered from them. Following the death of Canute, Magnus I would briefly rule both Norway and Denmark. However, it was the leadership of his successor, Sweyn II, that would make a more lasting impact on the kingdom. During Sweyn's reign, churches were constructed throughout Denmark, and he strove to unite his people with Christians throughout Europe by advancing the Danish people's knowledge of Latin. Sweyn was not without controversy however, and his relationship with the Church was often strained. During his lifetime, he fathered over 20 children, 19 of whom have been confirmed to be illegitimate (born out of wedlock). Of those 19, five (Harald III, Canute IV, Olaf I, Eric I, and Niels) would peacefully succeed one another as future kings of Denmark over the 60 years following Sweyn's death in 1074. Starting in 1397 and lasting up until 1523, Denmark was part of what came to be known as the Kalmar Union, through which the Kingdoms of Denmark, Norway and Sweden were united under a single leader. It was during this union that Denmark's first female monarch, Queen Margaret I, would serve until 1412. The current Queen of Denmark, Margrethe II, is the only other female ruler since.Later History  Throughout the 16-18th centuries, Denmark was a prosperous nation, benefiting from increased trade with Europe during this period. Christian IV, Denmark's longest serving monarch, having ruled from 1588 until 1648, instituted a number of policies that would both expand Denmark's national defenses as well as bolster its economic and cultural foundations. During his reign, Christian more than doubled the size of the Danish navy, while also commissioning the construction of numerous fortresses. In 1616, the founding of the Danish East India Company would lead to a brief windfall for the nation, thanks to a trade monopoly awarded by Christian and various tea smuggling operations into England. Although he remains a popular historical leader in Denmark, his involvement in multiple wars, particularly the Thirty Years' War, would actually lead to a decline in Danish power throughout the Baltic region. During the Napoleonic Wars, Britain's displeasure with continued Danish trade with the French would lead to increasingly aggressive skirmishes at sea. In 1801, much of the Danish navy was destroyed by a British fleet outside of Copenhagen. Britain would grow increasingly concerned that Denmark's fall to the French was inevitable, leaving Britain with restricted access to the Baltic Sea, an unthinkable loss to the British military command. In 1807, the Bombardment of Copenhagen (The Second Battle of Copenhagen) began when a massive British fleet, accompanied by ground forces encircling the city, attacked a greatly outnumbered Danish force that refused to surrender. Copenhagen was badly damaged, and over 5,000 civilians and soldiers were killed in the ensuing attack. The British confiscated any remaining ships of the Danish fleet, and drew Denmark into war on the side of the French. Denmark would fight until 1813, when the war effort plunged the nation into bankruptcy, forcing the signing of the Treaty of Kiel between Great Britain, Sweden, and the allied Kingdoms of Denmark and Norway.World War II  Although neutral in World War I, Denmark would become unavoidably engrossed in World War II. In April 1940, Germany invaded Denmark, meeting little resistance. Denmark was allowed to maintain the majority of its own independent government functions and continued to cooperate with Germany economically during the occupation, until 1943. In August of that year, Denmark's leadership finally refused any further participation, and ordered the majority of its fleet to be scuttled. Throughout the occupation, the Danish government and the resistance movement successfully assisted the majority of Danish Jews in escaping to Sweden. After its liberation in 1945, Denmark quickly joined the Allied forces and became one of the founding members of the United Nations. Denmark was also active in the formation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), a military alliance formed in early 1949.Modern Denmark  Today, Denmark is a constitutional monarchy, with Queen Margrethe II serving as its head of state over a parliamentary system of government. Denmark joined the European Economic Community (predecessor to the European Union) after a public referendum voted in favor of membership in 1972. However, unlike many member nations, Denmark has rejected changing its currency to the Euro. Modern Denmark has a robust economy that thrives despite the nation's small size, with Denmark currently ranking 16th in the world for GDP. The primary exports in Denmark are food and livestock, as well as machinery and industrial supplies. Despite considerable oil resources, Denmark has proven to be world-leader in the adoption of wind power. Currently wind energy accounts for 30% of Denmark's total power generation, giving it the highest percentage of overall wind power utilization in the world. From the humble beginnings of the Danes of the Stone Age, Denmark has risen to become one of the world's most progressive nations.Cultural Figures  Denmark has produced a number of important cultural and scientific figures throughout its history. The Danish author and poet Hans Christian Andersen was renowned for his children's stories, which are still inspiring new renditions today. Niels Bohr, a Danish physicist who won the Nobel Prize in 1922, was instrumental in the development of the first atomic bomb. In the mid 20th century, the \"Father of Danish Design,\" Arne Jacobsen, would inspire designers and architects throughout the world with his modern, functional style, reflected in everything from furniture to lighting fixtures.Danish Trivia  \"Something is rotten in the state of Denmark,\" the oft quoted phrase from Shakespeare's play Hamlet, was a reference to the mismanagement of Denmark's political structure by the fictional King Claudius, murderer of his own brother (Hamlet's father). The \"Danish,\" a popular pastry served throughout the world, is originally attributed to Austrian bakers who worked in Denmark during a strike amongst bakery workers in 1850. In Denmark, this confection is known as \"Wienerbr\u00f8d,\" or \"Bread of Vienna.\" The term \"Danegeld,\" literally meaning \"Dane's debt,\" was originally used to describe a tax raised by French and English kings to pay off the Viking raiders rather than attempt to fight them. In modern times, Danegeld is used to reference any form of coercive payment to another.City-state (Civ5)  Back to game concepts\n\n Back to the Diplomacy article City-States are small independent political entities introduced in Civilization V, which could be linked in the real world to the small nations of little significance that don't have any ambitions for world domination. In essence, they are single-city civilizations that do not compete against anyone for the victory. Although they have the same capacity for producing units and buildings as normal civilizations, as well as technological and even cultural progress, they cannot build Settler units and thus are (almost) never interested in expansion. They do start with a Settler, who founds the city state on the same tile it spawned at the beginning of the game. Unlike the major civilizations, City-States don't have a military unit right at the beginning of the game. City-States start neutrally-disposed towards everyone, and how to deal with them is your choice - you can coddle them to improve relations, and eventually make them friends or even allies; or you can capture them (at which the\u00a0Mongolian civilization is especially good); or choose to ignore them. However, be mindful that they can be of immense help to you in the game and that they are needed to achieve a Diplomatic Victory. As with the default names of cities for all civilizations, all City-State names come from the real world. What's more, most of them are the (current) capital of an existing country, which is not present among the civilization choices. All of the short musical themes for the City-States were composed by Roland Rizzo and some are adapted from pre-existing soundtracks.Types of City-States  There are different types of City-States, depending on what they are focused on: Cultured, Maritime and Militaristic. Two new types of City-States, Religious and Mercantile, are added in the Gods & Kings expansion. Note that, unlike the special trait, the type of a City-State is pre-determined by its name (e.g. Hanoi will always be a Militaristic City-State).\u00a0 Each different type of City-State will provide you with a different bonus when you develop relations with them: Note that the amount of\u00a0 Culture and  Faith per turn gifted by Cultured and Religious States increases with the passing of eras, so that they become even more valuable. In addition, City-States also have a Personality trait, which can be Hostile, Neutral, Irrational or Friendly. This affects the default rate of  Influence change per turn and affects which quests they are most likely to give.City-State Tech Level and Army  All City-States progress technologically, producing \u00a0Science like all civilizations. Their tech level varies, but it follows the general tech level of the civilizations. This means when most civilizations are in the Medieval Era, most City-States will be there too. They develop the necessary technologies to access resources, including late-game strategic resources, such as Oil. All City-States build and maintain an army, with the size depending on the difficulty level, but their army is usually relatively small.\u00a0Their units' tech level again follows the general tech level. This means when you decide to invade a City-State in the Modern Era, you can expect them to defend with Infantries, Artilleries, etc. City-States build naval vessels, which sometimes explore the oceans far away from their territory (especially Caravels). It is also possible for a City-State to build an air unit, including guided missiles, although this is extremely rare. Also note in Brave New World, City-States do not build Caravans, Cargo Ships or Archaeologists.Relations and Influence  Relations with City-States depend on  Influence points, which are organized in a scale going from -60 to +n (because it's not clear whether there is a maximum Influence level), where the 0 represents the point of Neutrality. The amount of  Influence points determines your influence level with the City-State. There are five different influence levels: In Gods & Kings, there is a new influence status:\u00a0Afraid. This is achieved by having a strong military presence near the City-State. You can request tribute from City-States that are afraid, for either some  Gold or a Worker, but of course at the expense of  Influence points. This may also result in their quests for you being cancelled. You can find some more information about  Influence here, and also below.\u00a0 City-States also have one of the following four special traits, which are not connected with their name, but determined randomly at the start of the game (whereas their special bonus is always connected with the specific City-State):Interactions with City-States  When you meet a City-State for the first time, a screen will appear, showing the name of the City-State, and its attribute and personality. City-States will gift you 15 \u00a0Gold when you meet them for the first time (this is doubled if you are the first civilization to meet them). Religious City-States will also grant you 4  Faith (the double bonus for meeting them first also applies here). Also, the City-State is added to your Diplomacy menu, making it possible to interact with them from this point on. It is interesting to note that, for some reason, most City-States are located along the coast - take this into consideration when planning your early scouting. Clicking on a City-State name opens a menu which shows you their resources and your influence with them, besides their attribute and personality. Additional information is available via tooltips by hovering your mouse over the City-State banner in the World screen, or over different items in the City-State menu. For example, you can see exactly how many points of  Influence you need to replace the City-State's current Ally. There are various ways to increase the influence points you have with a City-State. The more basic ones are gifting  Gold (keeping in mind that the net benefit in making a large payment is bigger than the one from small payments; also, the effect diminishes with the passing of eras), or gifting units (although the amount of influence points you get is very low). Other common ways to increase influence include liberating captured Workers from the City-State and returning them. This nets 40  Influence, and is particularly useful in the early game. Also, whenever you kill a Barbarian unit within one tile of, or within the territory of a City-State, you'll receive 10  Influence points. Influence has a natural tendency to gravitate towards the\u00a0Resting Point\u00a0of the scale - 0 by default. If positive, it will diminish by 1 point each turn (by default), or if negative, it will increase by 1 point each turn. Certain civilization abilities and Social Policies (especially the Patronage tree) will change the speed with which influence changes naturally, or it may even set a new Resting Points level. Also, if the City-State shares the same religion as your majority religion, influence will diminish 25% slower. And if you declare to be the City-State's Protector, the Resting\u00a0Point of the scale will move up by 5.Violating a City-State's borders  If you aren't Friends or Allies with a City-State, you do not have permission to enter their territory with any military unit. (You can enter freely with civilian units, such as Workers or Missionaries.) In case you violate this rule, for any turn your units stay within the City-State's borders, your  Influence with them will diminish by 12 points. It is interesting to note that whenever there are Barbarians nearby, or within the City-State's territory, the usual penalty for violating its borders does not apply, even if you're not Friends or Allies. Any player can then march his or her military units on its territory without fear of \"diplomatic repercussions\" (the idea being that in this case, they are seen as \"protectors\" rather than \"invaders\").Quests  Another, much better way to gain influence with City-States is by performing quests for them. If they're at least Neutral to you, they'll occasionally contact you with a quest, and accomplishing it will give you influence points. The quest variety has been greatly expanded in Gods & Kings;\u00a0there are some which are timed (for a max of 30 turns), some which apply to all civilizations in the game, while others apply only to you. \u00a0 Here are the quests you can perform: When a City-State becomes the victim of bullying (another civ demands tribute from them/makes them afraid), they call for defense in one of the following manners, all of which only apply to you, and are valid for 30 turns: Finally, City-States will \"Call for...\" (some stats here, \u00a0Culture, \u00a0Faith or  Technologies). These quests are timed, and apply to all civs. Whoever gathers the most of the particular stat at the end of turn 30 will gain a large influence boost. Ties are allowed - in this case, all civilizations that were tied will gain influence. Note that while the  Culture and  Faith races call for a gross accumulation of points of said stats, the Technologies race applies to the number of technologies discovered, NOT science points gathered. All ways to discover tech are applicable, including Espionage and Wonders or Social Policies that give free techs.Protection  If you pledge to protect a City-State, the resting points with it are raised by 5. If your influence is below your resting points, the influence increases every turn. Combined with the Consulates policy from the Patronage policy tree, you achieve a base resting point of 25. You can revoke protection of a City-State at any time once 10 turns since your declaration of protection have passed. (In vanilla, doing this results in a penalty where you cannot pledge to protect the same City-State for a short period of time.) Note that pledging protection to a City-State means that you need to take their defense to heart! Failure to do so will enrage the City-State, resulting in a large loss of  Influence with them. Giving protection shouldn't be used lightly. Once given, there will be diplomatic consequences any time another civilization attempts to bully and/or attack that City-State. Whenever this happens, you will be offered a choice to either fulfill your promise and defend the City-State, which will anger the perpetrator civilization, or to break your promise, which will anger the City-State.Demanding a Tribute  In Gods & Kings,\u00a0there is a new interaction type: Ask for Tribute. This is literally bullying a City-State into giving you either some  Gold or a\u00a0Worker, and can only be done with a large military presence near the City-State. The City-State in question must be afraid of you before you can demand tribute from them. A City-State's fear of a given civilization is based on that civ's overall military might and the presence of military units belonging to that civ within 8 tiles of the City-State, as well as whether or not the civ has adopted the Gunboat Diplomacy tenet of the Autocracy ideology. A City-State's resistance to tribute demands is based on whether or not the City-State has another civ protecting it, if the City-State was recently bullied by the player, if a civ completes the quest of giving the City-State a gift of gold after tribute was demanded, if influence with that City-State is too low (less than -30), if the City-State has another civ as an ally, or if the City-State has the Militaristic trait. You can check the tooltips on the options shown when demanding tribute to see information on the fear and resistance in effect for that City-State. Asking for tribute will cause an immediate loss of  Influence (15 for demanding  Gold and 50 for demanding a Worker), and may also spark diplomatic incidents if the City-State has a protector. In case you are protecting a City-State, and another civilization takes tribute from it, they'll expect you to at least express outrage. If you don't, you'll lose 20  Influence and the protection will be automatically cancelled. If you do express outrage, you'll suffer a temporary penalty to relations with that civ, but your  Influence will remain unchanged. If a City-State gets bullied by another civ, there may be a quest following it if you are not protecting them. The quest could be pledging protection to\u00a0the City-State, giving them a gift of gold (any amount), or denouncing the bullying civ.Liberation  One way to earn lots of  Influence points is liberating a City-State. This becomes possible after another civ has conquered a City-State, and you take it from them later - you can then\u00a0choose to annex, puppet, or liberate it. Liberating a City-State makes it almost eternally grateful to you (meaning a lot of influence points), and the city is returned to the game as an individual City-State. It is important to note that the Allies status will still decrease over time. Also, the City-State will not be able to vote for the liberator in the United Nations or World Leader vote (since City-States can't vote), though the liberator will most likely have enough influence over the City-State to be able to take advantage of its voting power. Likewise, liberating or returning a Worker that belonged to a City-State from barbarians or an enemy civ will grant 45 \u00a0Influence. (Note that you can only return Workers to City-States you have met. Acquiring a Worker originally belonging to a City-State you haven't met yet immediately gives it to you without the option to return it, and meeting the City-State afterwards still won't allow you to return it then.)Austria and Venice  The Austrian and Venetian civilizations are masters of City-State diplomacy. The Austrian court excels at gaining the allegiance of City-States by arranging diplomatic marriages between the royal line and influential people from the City-State, while the famous Merchant of Venice is able to lead a blitz campaign to buy out all major assets of a City-State, thus making it totally dependent on the Venetian civilization as a Puppet state. The target of these operations will join the relevant nation with all its troops and civilians. It will also lose the status of City-State and will act as though it were a settled city. The city can no longer be liberated, permanently removes delegates from the World Congress, and can be razed if captured by an enemy civilization. This effect is far superior to conquering the City-State, because it comes without all the mess of reduced population, destroyed buildings, Resistance, etc.City-States during War  As stated above, each City-State maintains a small army. As a general rule, their army stays within, or close to, their borders, and serves to defend the city from Barbarians or hostile civilizations that invade with the purpose of conquering them. In rare cases, a military unit may stray to attack a nearby encampment. This changes, however, if the City-State is dragged as an ally into a serious war between civilizations. In this case, the City-State army will not only defend, but also attempt to attack nearby hostile countries (usually despite being vastly outnumbered). If the enemy, be it a nation or another City-State, has a city right nearby, the City-State will send their units to attack that city. Their armies can also pillage improvements and capture Workers. In very rare cases they may manage to capture another city, which is then temporarily added to their own territory. City-States will not pursue the enemy further and will always raze captured cities, with only a few exceptions. They cannot, for example, raze another City-State (should one have been allied to the enemy), or a civilization  Capital. Of course, if the reverse occurs and City-State is conquered by another civilization, it will cease to exist unless liberated later on. Note that if the  Happiness of the allied civilization of a City-State falls into the negatives, this will also affect the combat strength of the City-State \u2013 not just those of their army proper. The city-state units will suffer the very same penalty the units of the allied civilization suffer, as long as their  Happiness is below 0 (though the City-State won't suffer revolts).Espionage and City-States  Starting in Gods & Kings, the new Espionage game-play feature allows an additional way of manipulating City-State Influence. You can now send one of your Spies into any City-State (even the ones you're currently at war with). Once they establish their surveillance network, your spies start manipulating elections which are held regularly (every 15 turns; apparently, the general idea is that every City-State is a democracy). When doing this, they try to plant people in the government which are more friendly to your civ, and less so to others. If they rig an election successfully, your  Influence level with the City-State rises, while the  Influence of all other civs falls. Normally, the boost is enough not only to offset the natural decline in  Influence, but also to bump it up a bit. Eventually, you will become friends and later allies with this City-State. Rigging elections may not work if there is a rival spy in the City-State. In this case, you have to beat a check based on the experience level of the two spies and how long they have been in the City-State, plus any other special bonuses. But if you don't feel like waiting for the City-State's allegiance, you can order your Spy to Stage a Coup. This more extreme action attempts to completely replace the current government with the one full of your supporters. If successful, the City-State becomes your Ally, and their former Ally's  Influence level will be switched with yours. Also, all other civs lose some  Influence. The chance of success depends on several factors, among them the Spy's level, your current  Influence level with the City-State, etc. Note that a coup is only possible if the City-State currently has an Ally. What's more, a failed coup results in your Spy's death, as well as loss of some  Influence with that City-State, as its officials discover the relationship of the failed spy with your civilization. Use this option with care! It is possible to stage a coup in a City-State with which you're currently at war. If successful, you can immediately make peace with them, even if their current patron is still at war with you!City-States and Diplomatic Victory  City-States play a major role in diplomatic victories. When the United Nations\u00a0wonder is built, a UN vote is scheduled every once in a while to vote for a world leader. Every City-State in play will vote for its ally or choose to abstain. It is crucial to get City-States to back you, for\u00a0they are the tie breakers. It is\u00a0relatively simple to obtain votes from City-States if quests they have issued have been completed.\u00a0It is also possible to gain influence by bribery, and maxing out the influence possible by completing \"investment projects\" will give the best bang for the buck. Depending on how the game is configured (number of civilizations and City-States), the City-States are necessary for having the majority vote.Brave New World  With the introduction of the World Congress, City-States also receive an even larger role in achieving a diplomatic victory. From the Industrial Era and then, you can acquire more delegates by making allies of City-States. The more City-State allies you have, the more additional delegates you get. The conditions for a diplomatic victory remain the same. However, in Brave New World, rather than being an actual World Wonder,\u00a0the United Nations now develops automatically from the Congress. This occurs when any civilization reaches the Information Era, OR at least half the world's civilizations reach the Atomic Era. From then, a vote for the World Leader will be held every 20 turns.Known Bugs List of City-States  The following are comprehensive lists of the City-States that can be found in the game. Mercantile and Religious City-states were added in the Gods & Kings expansion pack.\u00a0 Note that there are a limited number of City-States generated in the beginning of each game (depending on map size). The particular City-States are selected randomly among all five types, and distributed evenly around the map. The traits of a City-State with a particular name are always the same (e.g. Almaty will always be Militaristic) regardless of its location on the map; however, the resources it has access to may differ according to its location from game to game (so that Almaty won't always have Iron and Cotton, for example). There are a total of 72 different city states, 17 cultured city-states, 22 maritime city-states, 15 mercantile city-states, 10 militaristic city-states, and 8 religious city-states.\u00a0City-State Changes Pre-Expansion  Sydney replaced Copenhagen as a City-State a day after the Denmark DLC pack was released. Quebec City replaced Oslo as a City-State as well. Kathmandu replaced Seoul as a City-State when the\u00a0Korea DLC pack was released, the same day the August 2011 patch was released.Gods & Kings  Dublin, Edinburgh, Helsinki, Stockholm and Vienna were removed as City-States and became individual cities of a few new civilizations (The Celts, Sweden and Austria). New City-States included in Gods & Kings: Geneva and Lhasa have been changed from Cultured to Religious. Genoa and Singapore have been changed from Maritime to Mercantile. Tyre has been changed from Militaristic to Mercantile.Brave New World  Jakarta, Lisbon, Marrakech, Rio de Janeiro, Venice and Warsaw were removed as City-States and became the capitals of many new civilizations (Indonesia, Portugal, Morocco, Brazil, Venice and Poland, respectively). New City-States included in Brave New World: Kathmandu has been changed from Cultured to Religious. Three new City-States were added in the Fall 2013 patch:List of technologies in Civ5  Back to Civilization V\n\n Back to Science Article Technologies are the scientific advancements of your empire. Each technology unlocks certain\u00a0buildings, units or other advancements. For more info on the exact process of obtaining technologies, see the Science article. This is the list of technologies in Civ5, updated for the Brave New World expansion. Please note that in the Gods & Kings expansion pack, the Future Era has been removed, and is now replaced with the Atomic and Information Eras. Also,  SP costs for researching technologies are approximate and vary according to map size and the number of cities an empire has at any given moment (both regular and Puppeted).Brave New World Gods & Kings Civilization V Note  Calculus, Naval Tradition, Patronage, and Publishing were planned as technologies, but left out for undisclosed reasons. Their quotes were going to be:Korean (Civ5)  Back to the list of civilizations The Korean people represent a DLC civilization for Civilization V that was released in August 2011 along with the Samurai Invasion of Korea scenario.Strategy  Korea is a science-oriented civilization: the unique ability grants a +2  Science bonus to all specialists and Great People improvements, as well as a science bonus equivalent to a research agreement once a building that provides direct science output is built in the capital. While it is said that Science Wonders also provide the bonus, the only wonder that gives the player the bonus is the Great Library, and because the research agreement science bonus does not stack, this bonus is no greater than simply building a Library in the capital. While the science boost through the construction of science buildings seems insignificant, the 2  Science bonus from each specialist and Great Person tile improvement more than makes up for it, as it essentially works out like a slightly better version of Secularism in the Rationalism tree. This is independent of said policy, so a Korean specialist with Secularism (even if it is not a scientist) will still generate more raw science than a scientist of other civilizations provided that said civilization doesn't have Secularism. However, since these bonuses only apply to things that are unavailable in the early game, Korea's early game is nowhere as near as solid as that of Babylon, another science-oriented civilization. Nonetheless, populous cities which can afford to work specialist tiles will quickly make Korea a scientific powerhouse not only by providing science, but also by providing Great People points. Thus it is important for Korea to have solid growth to maximize its unique ability. Korea's unique units are defensive in nature. While they have limitations on their overall utility, they have very powerful combat strength that dwarfs other units in the same era. The Hwach'a, a Medieval Era unit that replaces the Trebuchet, is particularly powerful when defending against infantry; its firepower is only marginally less than the Artillery that comes in the late Industrial Era, allowing the Hwach'a to decimate units caught within its firing range. This comes at the cost of lower base combat strength and the attack bonus against cities, making Hwach'a ill-suited for siege combat. The Turtle Ship is also a powerful defensive unit. While its strength comes at the cost of the ability to travel through deep ocean outside of Korean territory, the Turtle Ship boasts the largest combat strength increase of any unique unit, being 80% stronger than the Caravel that it replaces. It can be a strong offensive tool against coastal neighbors not separated by deep oceans, pillaging coastal trade routes and improvements and perhaps taking coastal cities with support.Civilopedia Entry History  The Korean peninsula, known today for its divided republics of North and South Korea, has been home to numerous kingdoms over the ages, some virtuous, some steeped in infamy. At times rivaling its powerful neighboring states of China and Japan, Korea was united under the rule of the Choson Dynasty for over 500 years. The turmoil of the Japanese occupation in the early 20th century, followed by the Korean War in 1950, would shatter this once sacred unity. From this strife, South Korea has emerged as a nation of increasing economic and cultural significance on a global scale. In contrast, the oppressive regime controlling the reclusive North Korean state is frequently the subject of international condemnation for its handling of human rights and diplomatic relations.Climate and Terrain  Situated between the East Sea and the Yellow Sea, the Korean Peninsula shares its northern border with China, and to a lesser extent Russia, separated respectively by the Amnok and Tumen rivers. Although Korea features a diverse geography, the country is primarily mountainous, the highest peak being Baekdu Mountain at 9,003 ft (2,744 m). Like its neighbors, Korea is affected by the East Asian Monsoon each summer, bringing the possibility of intense rainfall and oppressive humidity to much of the region. The winter months can also be quite harsh, with subzero temperatures not uncommon, particularly in the north.Pre-History and the Old Kingdom  From at least the Middle Paleolithic era, Korea was inhabited by humans living in caves or under rock outcroppings near the sea. Over the course of several thousand years, primitive communities would form, primarily as these gatherers became more adept at hunting. Of the numerous early communities found throughout the peninsula, one in particular would rise to prominence and become the foundation for all of the Korean kingdoms to come - \"Ko Choson,\" also known as \"Old Choson.\" Old Choson was founded in approximately 2000 BC by the legendary figure Tan'gun Wanggom, whose father is said to have descended from the heavens. Some modern historians believe the name \"Tan'gun Wanggom\" may have actually been a title given to early authority figures, representing both a political and religious figure within the community. Whether guided by the hand of a single leader, or a number of early rulers, Old Choson would become the most advanced of the early Korean tribal kingdoms throughout the advent of the Iron Age in the 4th century BC.Rise of the Three  For most of the 1st millennium AD, Korea was divided by the rule of three distinct monarchies. The \"Three Kingdoms of Korea\" -- Koguryo, Paekche, and Silla -- each controlled a segment of the peninsula, with Koguryo being the largest and, for a time, the most powerful. However, diplomatic relations would prove to be the undoing of the Koguryo, as its southernmost rival, Silla, negotiated an alliance with the Tang Dynasty of China. This alliance would bring great strength to Silla, allowing them to conquer both the Paekche and the Koguryo by 668, leaving the Silla with uncontested control of most of the Korean Peninsula.Transforming Kingdoms  Having conquered the kingdoms of Koguryo and Paekche, the new \"Unified Silla,\" often referred to as the \"Later Silla,\" would continue to control the peninsula for several hundred years. As is often the case after such a long period of uninterrupted dominion, the authority of the king began to come into question around the 9th century AD. The \"bone-rank system,\" a sort of hereditary segregation based on a person's blood ties to the king, had maintained the balance of power between the king and the aristocratic nobility for some time. However, this system would ultimately contribute to the downfall of the Silla, as the nobility they desperately relied on for taxation and management grew tired of the caste system that limited their role in governance. In the end, continuous internal strife would lead to the kingdom's submission to the emerging Koryo Dynasty by 935. The Koryo would maintain a sovereign kingdom within Korea, despite pressure from the Mongol Yuan Dynasty of China, until 1392.Choson Dynasty  The Choson Dynasty, widely regarded as the most notable kingdom in Korea's history, was founded by the rebellious Koryo Commander Yi Song-gye in 1392. Ordered to invade the neighboring Chinese province of Liaotung (a pre-emptive strike against the Chinese Ming Dynasty), Yi instead seized the opportunity to control Korea himself, leading his army into the Koryo capital and dethroning the king in a military coup. Forming his own dynasty and renaming himself King Taejo of Choson, named for the ancient Choson kingdom, Taejo would create the first unified Korean dynasty in the country's history. The most revered of the Choson leaders, King Sejong the Great, ruled from 1418 until his death in 1450. Sejong's policies paved the way for vast strides in the arts and sciences during his reign, including the publication of the Korean written language, \"Hangul.\" It was also during this period that Korean Confucianism, its roots established during the preceding Koryo dynasty, would take hold over Korea. Neo-Confucianism, known as \"Seongnihak,\" would become the primary school of thought for scholars across the peninsula. These Confucian values, emphasizing morality and self-improvement, became the basis for many of the values held sacred by Korean society today. The Choson Dynasty would be ruled by 27 distinct monarchs during its 500-year rule, ending in 1897. During the waning years of the dynasty, Korea underwent a period of isolationism, limiting contact with the surrounding nations in an effort to blunt outside influence. Having long been the subject of Chinese and Japanese influence, many historians believe that it was during this period, when Korea became known as the \"Hermit Kingdom,\" that the first hints of a modern Korean national identity began to take shape.Korean Empire  The First Sino-Japanese war, fought between China and Japan across large swaths of the Korean peninsula beginning in 1894, would provide the first glimpse of Japan's emerging strength in East Asia. Having long been the subject of Chinese influence and fearful of the emerging power demonstrated by Japan, the Choson leadership saw fit to declare the creation of the Korean Empire in 1897. Hoping to assert Korea's independence from both China and Japan, these aspirations would be short lived. Japan quickly moved to assert control over Korea after defeating much of the Chinese Qing Dynasty's forces.Japanese Occupation  The Japan-Korea Treaty of 1910 (which Korean historians to this day claim was only signed under extreme duress) would effectively annex the whole of Korea to Japan. Despite an active resistance movement among the Korean people from the early stages of the occupation, Japan maintained control over the nation for nearly 35 years. The \"Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea,\" based in Shanghai, China, would serve as the Korean government- in-exile throughout the occupation. Japan's hold over Korea finally came to an end on September 2, 1945 following Japan's defeat in World War II. Today, many Koreans still harbor a strong resentment towards Japan for this dark period in their history.Korean War  The Korean War, the great conflict that divided the Korean Peninsula as it stands today, arose from the vacuum of power following Japan's defeat in World War II. The 38th Parallel, a dividing line agreed upon by the United States and the Soviet Union, was expected to mark a temporary administrative split between the countries. In 1948, North Korea would form a communist government led by Kim II-Sung, while South Korea elected its first president (through heavily rigged elections), Syngman Rhee, via national elections. Both leaders insisted the Korean people should be united under one rule, but each expected the unification to occur under their own political system. In June 1950, North Korea invaded the South, aided by Soviet military equipment from World War II. Shortly thereafter, the United Nations issued a resolution condemning the invasion and recommending military intervention by its member states. At the time, the United States considered the spread of Communism to be a direct result of Soviet influence, and responded as the primary military force aiding South Korea. Although North Korea captured much of the southern territory early in the war, the arrival of American forces under the leadership of General MacArthur soon countered those gains. Eventually regaining South Korea's territory up to the 38th Parallel, the American and South Korean forces would fight the North to an eventual stalemate. Negotiations for an armistice, which would serve to end the fighting - but not officially end the war - began in 1951 and would continue for several years. The armistice agreement was finally signed by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North) and the Republic of Korea (South) under the guidance of the United Nations in 1953.Division of Korea  Officially, the armistice agreement signed by the Korean republics only stipulated an end to the fighting, meaning the two are theoretically still at war. Today, the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) dividing them is the most heavily fortified border on earth, with both sides vigilantly observing the other. Over the years, a number of incidental incursions and other violations of the armistice have occurred, primarily antagonistic actions by the North Korean regime. Despite these incidents, the delicate cease fire has remained in effect for over 50 years.Modern Korea  Today, South Korea has become a world leader in science and technological development, and is recognized as one of the \"Four Asian Tigers,\" a group of four highly developed industrialized economies in Asia (the other three being Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan). Home to a well-educated and highly skilled work force, South Korea has a strong culture of technological adoption, boasting some of the fastest residential internet connections available, and is home to industry leaders Samsung and LG, two of the largest mobile phone manufacturers in the world. Conversely, the secretive government of North Korea has struggled to provide the necessities of daily life to its people, who are known to suffer through famine and poverty under the Communist regime. Isolated from public scrutiny, what little we know of North Korea comes from defectors who have managed to escape or from the rarely allowed visit by foreign journalists. Frequently sanctioned for developing weapons programs deemed dangerous by the international community, North Korea has a limited economy and is supported by constant aid from the People's Republic of China and humanitarian efforts initiated by the United Nations member states.Korean Trivia  South Korea is famous for its gaming culture, particularly a love affair with the classic Blizzard title StarCraft. Professional matches and tournaments receive widespread media attention throughout the country, including broadcasts on several television networks. The Chinese characters for Choson were often translated into English as \"Morning Calm,\" which later evolved into the nickname \"The Land of the Morning Calm,\" referring to all of Korea. Kimchi, the widely recognized dish native to Korea, generally accompanies every meal in Korean cuisine. Typically made from fermented cabbage, radish, scallions, or cucumbers, there are literally hundreds of unique recipes and varieties of Kimchi available today. The national sport of South Korea, Tae Kwon Do, is attributed to the original nine \"Kwans,\" or schools of Tae Kwon Do, that developed after the end of the Japanese occupation of Korea. The sport itself is believed to have originated with the traditional Korean martial art known as \"Taekkyeon.\"Trivia Giant Death Robot (Civ5)  Back to the list of unitsGame Info  Ultimate military unit of the Information Era. Upgrades from the Modern Armor. Requires  Uranium.Strategy  The Giant Death Robot is the battle machine of the future and the toughest unit in the game - a towering mass of guns, rockets and futuristic death-rays. It is one and a half times as strong as the next-strongest land units (the Modern Armor and the XCOM Squad) and can attack anything, including cities, with little fear of being outmatched. Also, the Giant Death Robot can move after attacking, making it one of the most strategically flexible units in the game. Although it doesn't benefit from defensive terrain, its simple brute strength is compensation enough. Despite all these perks, the Giant Death Robot is most certainly not invincible. Being a melee unit, it is susceptible to focused ranged attack (especially aerial bombardment). A large enough group of units of any kind will also suffice in defeating it. With all this in mind, it would be unwise to rely on a single robot as if it were a whole army. Finally, keep in mind that you need Uranium to build the Giant Death Robot. If you intend on having it in your army, you should build Nuclear Plants and nukes sparingly in order to save more Uranium for the robots.Civilopedia entry  The \"mech\" is a giant bipedal mechanical robot armed with a variety of missiles, Gatling gun arms, laser-beam eyes and a deadly kung-fu punch. Although not currently found on the modern battlefield, no doubt across the world governments and evil corporations are secretly developing these metal behemoths even as we speak. When these mechs come into service, all of the world's other weaponry will become obsolete, and humanity's fate will be decided by a climactic battle between armies of good and evil mechs in the streets of downtown Tokyo. (Assuming that the giant radioactive monsters don't get us first.)Trivia Babylonian (Civ5)  Back to the list of civilizations The Babylonian people represent a DLC civilization for Civilization V that was released in October 2010.Strategy  The Babylonians are a scientific civilization, meaning they are geared towards outpacing other civilizations in technological advancements. The free Great Scientist upon the discovery of Writing allows one to construct an Academy improvement very early on in the game. This usually increases the empire's  Science output by a factor of 3, allowing one to take an early lead in technology. This lead becomes hard for the AI players to overcome on all difficulties outside of Immortal and Deity. Again, thanks to Babylon's unique ability, earning Great Scientists is also faster (and easier). This allows one to keep ahead of every other nation technologically. Try combining this with Rationalism, so that others will never be able to catch up to you in technological development. What's more, the Babylonians are also very good at defensive combat, particularly in the early game. Their unique replacement for the Archer, the Bowman, as well as their unique\u00a0early game\u00a0defensive building, the Walls of Babylon, can make up a great way to defend your cities. Make use of both of these, and you will have a strong defense against enemy attacks. On the other hand, the rapid technological development also means more buildings will become available earlier. This may prove to be a big problem if not balanced with city  Production output or the empire-wide  Gold output, so it's advisable to try to either improve your cities'  Production, or build a strong economy. Many players prefer to focus on economic development, as the Rationalism branch in Gods & Kings grants a perk that makes Trading Posts provide  Science in addition to enhancing  Gold generation.Civilopedia Entry History  The Babylonian Empire was, rather than a new idea, a reinvigoration of the old Sumerian Empire of the city of Ur, which had also occupied the Fertile Crescent in what is today Southern Iraq. Babylonia was formed from a collection of roughly a dozen city-states and was named for its capital city of Babylon. (Pre-empire, the city of Babylon itself was in existence since at least the 24th century BC.)Terrain and Climate  Babylon was located in the Fertile Crescent, the incredibly fecund region around the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, extending west to the Mediterranean and down through modern Israel. The Fertile Crescent not only benefits from the rich soil and irrigation provided by the two ancient rivers, but it also lies at the crossroads of three major landmasses: Africa, Asia, and Europe, meaning it has insects, plants and animals from all three sources. This gives the region a biodiversity unmatched anywhere in the world. This also means that its human inhabitants had a huge variety of plants and animals to experiment with when learning how to farm and herd animals, thus explaining why humans advanced so rapidly in this area.The Old Babylonian Empire  Originally a disorganized region, Babylon and Babylonia began to grow as a center for culture, trade, and religion under the rule of Hammurabi in 1728 BC. Hammurabi was the first known ruler of United Babylonia as well as its greatest lawgiver. Hammurabi's Code of Laws specifically listed the acts that were criminal as well as the punishment for each act. Citizens were no longer at the mercy of capricious judges or nobility who could on a whim decide what was and wasn't illegal. So comprehensive was the Babylonian code that little about its laws or governmental system changed in the entirety of the empire's 1,200 years of existence.Record-keeping and Mathematics  Much like the Sumerian empire from which they were descended, Babylonia was a nation of fanatical record-keepers. Starting with Hammurabi and continuing down until the empire's dissolution at the hands of Cyrus and the great Persian emperors, every financial transaction, every court verdict, every contract, and just about anything that could be written down, was-on clay tablets. With laws pertaining to almost every aspect of daily living a significant amount of data was recorded, and much of this has been uncovered and excavated during the modern era. Researchers have even found several optical devices, similar to magnifying glasses, which were used to allow record keepers to write in smaller cuneiform, in order to fit more information on each clay tablet. Despite numerous regime changes, education reached exceptional heights among the Babylonians. Technical achievements such as the creation of a base 60, \"sexigesimal,\" system of mathematics, are still used to this day. Sixty seconds per minute, sixty minutes per hour: modern time, is in fact, Babylonian time.Intermittent Chaos, with Chance of Massacre  After the death of Hammurabi (1750BC), the empire slowly declined in power and influence. Following a Hittite raid which weakened the city, in approximately 1600 BC it was conquered by the Kassites who had emerged from what are now the mountains of Iran. The Kassites controlled Babylonia for 500 years, renaming the city Karanduniash. In 1234 the Assyrian king Tukulti-Ninurta I temporarily conquered the city but the Kassites eventually reasserted independence, just in time for the Elamites to sack the city in 1158. Then the Babylonians regained control of their city (possibly because the Elamites had stolen everything that any invader might want). By 1124 the Babylonian Nebuchadnezzar I sacked the Elamite city of Susa in revenge for their earlier attack on Babylon. But by 1000 BC, Babylon was once again under pressure from a resurgent Assyria. Babylon remained more or less under Assyrian domination until 627 BC.The Neo-Babylonian Empire  In 627 BC, Babylonia successfully revolted once again from Assyrian control. The revolt was led by a new leader, Nabopolassar, who would reign for some twenty years before passing the throne to his more famous son.Nebuchadnezzar II  Nabopolassar's son, Nebuchadnezzar II, ruled Babylonia from 605 to 561 BC. He established himself early as a military leader, leading an army under his father in Assyria, and then later an independent command against Egypt, destroying the Egyptian army at Carchemish and gaining Babylonian control of all of Syria. Nebuchadnezzar was deeply invested in the city of Babylon. During his reign it enjoyed something of a renaissance. Nebuchadnezzar engaged in a variety of city revitalization projects, rebuilding ancient temples and buildings, construction extensive fortification, and so forth. He also created the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. He employed foreign workers for much of the hard labor, which as an additional benefit dramatically increased the city's population. Nebuchadnezzar died in 561 BC. For more on Nebuchadnezzar II, see his Civilopedia entry.The Fall of Babylon  The leaders following Nebuchadnezzar were lesser men, and within thirty years Babylonian power and prestige were greatly weakened. It is said that when Cyrus II of Persia attacked in 539 BC, the city fell almost without resistance. It remained under Persian control until 331 BC, when it was captured by Alexander the Great, and then to the Seleucid dynasty after Alexander's death. In the period since, Babylon has all but vanished, reduced to mysterious mounds and piles of rubble, waiting for archaeologists to uncover their secrets.Conclusion  Babylonia played an important role in the development of law throughout the world. The creation of Hammurabi's code of laws, and the zeal with which his successors, both blood \u2013related and not, upheld those laws, demonstrated for all of history how successful and wealthy a nation could become by following an organized system of government. The rest of Babylon's history reminds us that nothing lasts forever, and that even the greatest of empires will someday be nothing more than dust beneath the next empire's chariot wheels. Or tank treads.Babylonian Trivia  Prior to the construction of the Colossus of Rhodes, the Babylonian Ishtar Gate was considered one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. The 8th gate to the inner city of Babylon, the Ishtar Gate was designed as both an entry and a shrine to the Babylonian goddess Ishtar, who represented sexuality, fertility, and love. The famed walls of Babylon were at one time also considered amongst the Seven Wonders of the World. The Ancient Greek historian Herodotus recorded that these walls surrounding the city were over 90 m (300 feet) high, 25 m (80 feet) thick, and 90\u00a0km (56 miles) long, although his account is dubious in the eyes of modern archaeologists.Spanish (Civ5)  Back to the list of civilizations The Spanish people represent a DLC civilization for Civilization V that was released in December 2010 along with the Inca and the Conquest of the New World scenario. They were included again in Civilization V: Gods & Kings.Strategy  The Spanish are the masters of exploration. They receive 100  Gold bonus for discovering a Natural Wonder, which goes up to a whopping 500  Gold if they were the first to discover it, creating an advantage for the early game. Spain also gets double  Happiness for discovering a Natural Wonder. Furthermore, the tile yields from Natural Wonders are doubled, which makes them very potent early sources of  Science,  Faith and  Gold - yet another great advantage in the early game. Finally, the bonuses from the One with Nature pantheon and the Natural Heritage Sites resolution are doubled as well, allowing the Spanish to reap some of the benefits of their discoveries in the later eras. Later in the game they gain access to the Conquistador - arguably the best scouting unit in the game - which can not only see far and move rapidly on land, but is also capable of settling cities on islands or other continents! Research Astronomy ASAP and send them across the seas to literally conquer the New World - first scouting it, then immediately settling cities in the locations left unsettled by the other civilizations. To use best the advantages of this civilization, produce 2-3 Scouts immediately after founding your capital, then send them in search of Natural Wonders. If there are any near your starting location, settle cities near them immediately to take advantage of their exceptional output, not found normally on the land.Civilopedia Entry History  Spain's location on the Iberian Peninsula between North Africa and Europe has made it an important territory from prehistoric times to the present. At one time the first world Imperial power, Spain later had to survive devastating wars and centuries of political unrest. From its discovery and colonization of the New World to its involvement in countless wars of independence, Spain is one of the few countries which can claim such a lasting and encompassing global influence.Geography and Climate  The Kingdom of Spain is the 51st largest country in the world, only some 31,000 squares bigger than the state of California. The majority of the country is dominated by high plateaus and mountain ranges, including the Sierra Nevada in the south and the Pyrenees to the north. Spain's highest peak is located on one of its island holdings, the volcano Teide on Tenerife, a member of the Canary Islands. Spain's climate is incredibly diverse, even if only considering the mainland and none of the colonies. The southern areas bordering the Mediterranean Sea enjoy a mild Mediterranean and semi-arid climate, the central plain is Continental in nature, and the northern areas vary between Oceanic and Mountainous temperatures. Also, contrary to popular belief, the rain in Spain does not fall mainly in the plain-it's usually found in the mountains.Early History: From Cro-Magnons to Celts  Archeological evidence suggests that humans first arrived on the Iberian peninsula about 32,000 years ago, the Altamira cave paintings providing a famous artifact of their travels The peninsula was settled between two main groups, the Iberians and the Celts, the former populating the southern and eastern areas with the latter inhabiting the northern and western stretches. The peninsula placed the Celts and Iberians in a prime position for commerce, and many Phoenician and Greek merchants set up a thriving gold and silver trade, predominately within the city of Tartessos, located at present-day Seville. A few Phoenician, Greek, and Carthaginian trading colonies were founded along the Mediterranean coast of the peninsula, though the local populace retained control over most of their area, despite this influx of foreign gold and power.Enter the Romans  This continued until roughly 210 BC, when the Romans captured the Carthaginian colonies during the Second Punic War. At this point, the Romans launched a campaign into the heart of the Iberian peninsula, where they conquered nearly all of the landmass, Over the course of the next 500 years, the Celts and Iberians were steadily \"Romanized\" - local aristocratic families were inducted into Roman nobility, Roman roads and trading posts dotted the land, and new systems of irrigation techniques were established, including the famous aqueducts. Christianity was also introduced during this time and was quickly adopted by the local people. Rome, however, began to lose hold of the peninsula (now being referred to as \u201cHispania\u201d or \u201cIberia\u201d) when a Germanic invasion of Gaul pushed Suevi and Vandal peoples into Iberia in 409 AD. The displaced tribes set up a new kingdom in modern-day Galicia and Portugal, and Rome lacked the resources to stop them. The Vandals quickly spread across Iberia, leaving the Romans with a small southern holding along the coast, Spania. The Byzantine Romans hoped to retake Iberia from this vantage point, but soon the entire peninsula fell under Visigoth rule.The Arrival of the Moors  The Visigoths continued their control of Iberia for the next three centuries, until a sudden invasion by the Arab Muslim Umayyad Empire swept across the peninsula. The large Arab-led and Berber-reinforced armies crossed from North Africa into Gibraltar and conquered nearly the whole of Iberia in seven short years, from 711-718 AD. The new Islamic powers allowed the Christians and the Jews to continue their religious practices, but did require them to pay special taxes and submit to a few discriminatory practices. Despite these minor (for the given time) practices, many of the locals began converting to Islam. The invaders themselves were hardly unified despite their shared religion and purpose, and soon groups of Muslims were splitting off and forming settlements of their own, primarily in the Valencia and Granada regions. In the 11th century the Muslim territories fractured again, allowing some of the remaining Christian kingdoms to expand their boundaries. Christians and Muslims continued to wrest for control of Iberia for centuries, resulting in the creation of the Reconquista.The Reconquista, Unification, and Inquisition, Oh My  Officially starting with the Battle of Covadonga in 722 (but not gaining momentum until much later), the Reconquista was the name given to the Christians' attempt to reclaim Iberia from Muslim rule. Many important Christian kingdoms were founded by the Reconquista, such as Asturias and Aragon but most of the Muslim Kingdoms stubbornly held onto their land. For the next 700 years, a battle for the Iberian Peninsula raged between the Christians and the Muslims: strongholds were built and fell, power bases and balances shifted, and borders were redrawn on nearly a yearly basis. Despite the slow encroachment of the Christian-led kingdoms across Iberia, no clear victory presented itself. However, this all changed with the fateful union of the kingdoms of Castile and Aragon, joined by the marriage of Isabella I and Ferdinand II in 1469. The two monarchs led a pointed attack against the Islamic stronghold of Granada and in 1492 they finally ended the 781-year rule of the Muslims in Iberia. 1492 was an important year for the monarchs; Christopher Columbus, with the patronage of Isabella, arrived in America (leading to the colonization of the New World), and the Iberian Muslims and Jews were ordered to convert to Christianity or face expulsion or even death under the Inquisition. The new, unified kingdom of Isabella and Ferdinand became known as Espa\u00f1a (or Spain) and with her wealthy colonies in the new World became the first \u201cworld power\u201d of the time.Imperial Spain, Rulers of the New World  At its height, the Spanish Empire counted holdings across the entirety of the world-from large chunks of North and South America and small pieces of Europe, to various cities in North Africa and the Entirety of the East Indies. The Spanish led the world in this age of discovery, accumulating vast amounts of wealth and trade from their numerous colonies and principalities. It was said, and rightfully so, that the sun always shone somewhere in the Spanish Empire. Spain's new trade routes with the New World not only provided new knowledge and culture, but also new resources in the form of precious metals (i.e.,gold), spices, and plants. Spain's Golden Age also saw the creation of intellectual and spiritual reforms as well, starting with the escalation of humanism, beginnings of the Protestant Reformation, and the founding of the School of Salamanca.Troubles and Warfare, or, Spain can't get a break  When great power comes great responsibility, at least if you don't want Barbary pirates to conduct slave raids along your empire's coastal holding. Besides the growing pirate and Ottoman threat, Spain found itself routinely at war with France. Religious unrest and wars shook the Catholic empire, as the Protestant Reformation dragged the empire into ever-increasing military engagements across Europe. What unrest and religion didn't' touch, plague did, and in the 1650s, the empire was rocked by the Great Plague of Seville From this point forward, Spain's power and influence went into a gradual, and then not-so gradual decline. She began to lose her European holdings, primarily from the separation of Portugal and the Netherlands, and then suffered military setbacks from the highly destructive Thirty Years' War. Wars and more wars threatened and decimated the once proud empire for the next two centuries. In the 18th century, Napoleon Bonaparte invaded the country by trickery, claiming he was on his way to Portugal. Then in the early 19th century, a nationalist revolt to overthrow their French-occupationalist government led to the Spanish war of Independence, or the Peninsular War. Despite their eventual victory over the French (mostly due to Napoleon's disastrous Russian campaign) the country was thrown into political turmoil. Spain soon saw itself in turn facing multiple wars of independence from its own foreign colonies, cumulating in the Spanish-American War. The 20th century didn't bring much change for the fallen empire - The Spanish Civil War of the 1930s brought Fascism and an authoritarian government to the country, claiming over half a million lives in the process. This war is also commonly credited as the first battle of World War II. It wasn't until the death of General Francisco Franco, in 1975, that the Democracy was restored and things began to look up for Spain for the first time in the past 300 years.The Present and the Future  In 1978, Democracy was introduced to Spain with the approval of the Spanish Constitution; King Juan Carlos finally put a stop to rebel and radical Nationalist movements that had been rampaging across the country side, primarily led by a group of Basque terrorists. In 1982, Spain became a member of NATO, and then in 1986, a member of the European Community, which later became the European Union. From its glorious days as an Imperial power to its centuries of internal and international strife, Spain has rebuilt itself and re-emerged as a new world player, boasting the ninth largest economy and tenth highest quality of life in the world. A huge percentage of the world can trace back some part of its national identity or culture to Spain, from the architectural iron workings in New Orleans to the Catholic faith of the Philippines. Few current nations can claim to have such a far-reaching and lasting influence as Imperial Spain, both at the height of her power and today.Spanish Trivia  One of Imperial Spain's most recognizable legacies is its language - nearly 500 million people today speak Spanish, the second most popular language in the world. Spain is the leading nation in solar power production, overtaking the United States in 2010 with the completion of La Florida, a huge solar plant. Also, more than 50% of the energy generated in the country is provided by windmills, much to Don Quixote's displeasure. In theory, if not in practice, nudism is legal everywhere throughout Spain. The beret was invented in Spain by the Basque in the northeast Pyrenees. Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra wrote Don Quixote, which is credited as the first modern novel.Terrain (Civ5)  Back to Civilization V\n Back to Game concepts\n Go to the list of improvements Terrain is a term that describes the land in Civilization V and its features. The land is broken up into hexagonal tiles, which represents distinct areas of the terrain. Units appear on the terrain and are affected by it as they move about and fight on it, and  Citizens in cities can work the tiles to produce tile yields. Terrain can be claimed by empires as part of their Borders.Base Terrain  Base terrain is the type of ground a certain tile contains, and determines its base properties. Other terrain features, like a forest or a resource, might exist on top of a tile's base terrain. These features can modify a tile's properties, but its base terrain can never be changed. Sometimes these additional features can be removed, at which point the tile will revert to its base properties. There are several types of base terrains - plains, grassland, desert, tundra and snow. Check the table below for more info on the properties of each terrain type.Terrain Categories  Base terrain, along with the presence or absence of certain terrain features, are used to categorize tiles into several different types. \u0422hese categories are often used in game info and tooltips:Terrain Features  Certain special features often appear on base terrain, modifying its properties, or altering its use in the game. Some of them may be removed, while others are permanent, essentially forming more types of base terrain.Vegetation  Many areas of the land are covered in dense vegetation. They are known as forests, or jungles if located in warmer climates. Both forests and jungles usually cover vast expanses of land (more than 5 tiles, sometimes as many as 20-30 adjacent tiles). Large forest expanses are quite often found on tundra terrain, close to the snow borders of the far north and south; while jungles are found in more central areas (tropics, the Equator). Forests are considered more \"tame\" areas, while jungles teem with wildlife and have little use for civilization. Both features present obstacles to unit movement. Marshes are another special feature of the land - these are lowlands where underground water gathers to form large pools of stale, shallow lakes. Birds and low plants grow there, but generally the terrain becomes almost useless because of the unstable ground. Marshes may be found in many climates and also present obstacles to unit movement. All three types of vegetation may be removed by Workers to reveal the base terrain underneath and free the land for other uses.River  Rivers are of great importance for civilization historically, and they have special functions in the game as well. Rivers flow between tiles (which means that there is no special river tile), but they provide all tiles that border them with some special features. For example, they determine the formation of flood plains in a desert area (all desert tiles adjacent to a river become flood plains), provide access to fresh water to all adjacent tiles, and allow the construction of a number of buildings in cities adjacent to them. In vanilla Civilization V and Gods & Kings, rivers also provide 1  Gold potential to all adjacent tiles. In\u00a0Brave New World, they don't have this bonus anymore, but they provide additional  Gold bonus for Land Trade Routes opened to cities built next to them.\u00a0 Rivers present great obstacles to unit movement - each land unit passing a river will lose all its remaining MPs for its turn, unless there is a usable bridge over it or the unit has the Amphibious promotion.Hill  Relief features which rise high above the general level of surrounding land are known as hills. These are found on any base terrain type (including snow) and are quite useful for mining operations. Units that are standing on hills have better vision while they occupy them. Hills can either be solitary (occupying one tile), or form a highland of several adjacent hills. Hills also present obstacles to unit movement.Mountain  Tall relief features, mountains rise high enough for their peaks to be covered permanently with snow and become an impassable barrier. Most often they occupy only single tiles, but sometimes they extend through 3-4 nearby tiles, forming mountain ranges. These can be great obstacles to movement, because all mountain tiles are completely impassable (save the late game air units, and the Carthaginian civilization, provided that they've generated at least one Great General), and force land units to circle around them. Mountains have almost no use for civilization because of their harsh climate and difficult access. However, cities built right next to Mountains may construct some special buildings and World Wonders. Also, the Incan civilization gets additional  Food from their\u00a0Terrace Farms if built next to mountains.Ice  In the far north and south of the world, the so-called \"polar regions,\" temperatures are so low that water is permanently frozen. These ice tiles are completely impassable, save Submarines and Nuclear Submarines.Resources  Finally, many tiles may have resources on them - special commodities with great importance for civilization. Search these tiles out and try to include them in your empire's territory as soon as possible to gain a considerable advantage over the others.Relations between and Game Implications of Base Terrain and Features  Base terrains and features in the game combine according to logical real-world relations. Knowing them might allow a player to anticipate the presence/absence of certain features even before discovering them with his scouts. Here are some common relations:Terrain and Unit Mobility  The effectiveness and mobility of combat units is affected by the type of terrain they occupy. As stated above, many terrain features make movement more difficult, while at the same time providing additional options for cover and defense for combat. Such effects aren't found on water tiles, which all provide equal conditions for movement and combat. For more information, see Movement and Combat.Terrain and Combat  Finally, some terrain types automatically affect any combat waged there. Jungles, forests, and hills all give a defending unit many options to hide, which confers them a +25% combat bonus when defending. Marshes, flood plains, and oases have the exact opposite effect: they're open spaces which at the same time present difficulties to movement and reaction, in turn bringing a disadvantage to any unit defending there (-15% combat penalty).Nuclear Fallout  Few things in our world are so terrible as the results of a nuclear strike! Nuclear fallout is a terrain feature that represents these results in-game. It appears as a terrain feature on (usually all) tiles within the 2-tile blast radius of the nuke, making them completely unworkable and unproductive. In addition, entering a fallout tile without any movement infrastructure (Road or Railroad) will end a unit's movement. Fallout can be removed by a Worker with its special action Scrub Fallout - this will make the tile usable again. Note that this action doesn't repair any improvements on it - this will require a separate action!Terrain Potential  Each terrain tile may have production potential of some type, which may be used by an adjacent city working its tile. Most commonly, this potential includes  Food,  Production, or  Gold. Natural Wonders also have potential, including other types of stats. The particular potential a tile has depends on the features present on it, and follow this logic: OR What this means is that a plains base terrain with a Wine resource of it will have a potential of (1  Food and 1  Production from the base terrain) + 2  Gold from the Wine. However, a plains base terrain with a jungle on it and a Bananas resource will have 2  Food from the jungle (which overrides the base terrain) + 1  Food from the resource. Later, if you decide to cut down the jungle, the tile's potential will change to (1  Food and 1  Production) + 1  Food! It is important to note that all terrain/relief features alter the base terrain potential values. For example, a hill in the desert will have 2  Production potential, even though plain desert has no potential of any kind!\u00a0 Tile potential will be used by any city founded nearby, if the tiles in question are worked by its  Citizens. Note also that certain buildings built in the city which controls the tiles, and certain special abilities may alter the tile potential. Often we get cases when the same tile may be controlled by two different cities. If these two cities have different buildings which somehow affect yield from the tile, then its final potential may change all the time according to which city controls it currently. Also, your Workers may build improvements on tiles to add more potential. Below is a table with all terrain types and features and their potential: * The terrain tooltip indicates what forest/jungle/marsh tiles will turn into when cut/slashed/drained (respectively); very useful for planning\n **  Gold potential was 1 prior to Brave New World (see below)\n *** 2 with the Iroquois unique building Longhouse\n **** 3 with the Arabian unique building Bazaar\n \u2020 Incan units ignore movement cost for hills\n \u2021 Iroquois units move through friendly forest and jungle tiles as if a road was presentBrave New World changes  In the Brave New World expansion pack,  Gold potential has been removed from almost all terrain types, with the exception of the oasis. This was probably done to shift the gold-producing process away from terrain and more towards the new Trade Routes system. This makes conquering land with resources and/or Natural Wonders even more important in the early game, and you also need to develop your trading network really quickly, or you'll find yourself running in the red.Natural Wonders  There are some unique, incredible terrain features spread across the world. They are known as Natural Wonders and are special in every sense of the word! Each Natural Wonder is available only once in the world and provides unique benefits to whoever controls it, or even discovers its location, so send out your explorers in search for these features as soon as you're able!

Each improvement changes the properties of the tile where it's built, usually adding potential such as tile yields to it. Improvements are unlocked via certain technologies. Improvements built on certain strategic and luxury resources are required for an empire to access the resources' special properties.Mechanics  With the exception of Great Tile Improvements, most improvements can be built by a Worker (or a Work Boat at sea), given the appropriate technology and provided that the tile meets the requirements. Improvements remove forests and jungles unless otherwise specified (notably the Trading Post and Camp). Building with a Worker requires several turns, while the Work Boat finishes the improvement instantaneously. Improvements are susceptible to pillaging by enemies, including Barbarians. When any improvement is pillaged, it will be inactive until repaired by a Worker (including Great Tile Improvements). Improvement yields, (which includes both relevant increases depending on the resource, as well as bonuses from appropriate technologies such as Fertilizer), will be added to the base terrain yield combined with increased yields from the resource itself(yields provided \"when worked by a city\"). There are some improvements only available to certain civilizations. And finally, there are certain improvements that can only be built by using Great People. This article lists all improvements in Civilization V.\u00a0Standard Improvements  These improvements can be built by a worker anywhere there is appropriate terrain. Some may also connect resources.Transportation Improvements  These improvements can be built on any passable land tile, including outside your own territory. They can be built alongside any other improvement, and do not remove forests or jungles.Resource Improvements  These improvements can only be built on an appropriate resource. Both luxury and strategic resources will be connected. Mine excepted, these improvements are the only way to connect Luxuries.Great Tile Improvements  These improvements are built by Great People, with the exception of the Landmark in Brave New World. All great tile improvements can be built on any passable land terrain type. With regards to resources, they will only connect any strategic resources on the tile. While they get additional bonus yield from technology, they do not get an increase from the type of strategic resource. They do not have any effect on luxuries nor bonus resources. Valid only in the Gods & Kings expansion pack. Valid only in the Brave New World expansion pack.Unique Tile Improvements  These improvements are only available to certain civilizations, but do not replace a generic one. Unique Improvements are not used to connect any resources (for example, a Brazilwood Camp may not be placed on Bananas).Civilization Revolution  Sid Meier's Civilization Revolution (called Civilization Revolution or CivRev for short) is a 2008 iteration of Civilization developed by Firaxis with Sid Meier as designer for the Nintendo DS, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles. It is now available for the Apple iPad as well as the iPhone\u00a0and Windows Phone. A Wii version was originally expected but was put on indefinite hold. The lack of a PlayStation Portable version was attributed to a lack of development manpower. Sid Meier was enthusiastic about this game, being quoted in both the press release and trailer as saying, \"This is the game I've always wanted to make.\" A demo was released on Xbox Live Marketplace and the North American PlayStation Store on June 5, 2008. The demo allows players to play until 1250 AD as Cleopatra or Julius Caesar, and also allows multiplayer play. The Facebook game CivWorld has been replaced by the iOS version of Civilization Revolution. Facebook \"Search\" has no obvious link to it. The Xbox 360 version of the game was made backwards compatible for the Xbox One in April 2017.Gameplay  Civilization Revolution is a turn based strategy game in which the player can take on the role of one of 16 different civilizations, each with special abilities, occurring from prehistory to modern times and the near future. In past installments, the player had more control over the rules of the game and often the game could last for more than ten hours. In Civilization Revolution, the games for the most part can be finished within three hours. For the console version, the game-play has been streamlined and simplified to make the game easier to play for newcomers to the series. In addition to naming cities, players are randomly allowed to name geographical features such as mountain ranges, plains, forests or rivers.Victory Conditions  A victory can be achieved in four different ways. Unless specified/defined in a scenario all four victory conditions are open to be used. Different civilizations have distinct advantages over others depending on their \"bonuses.\" As a civilization nears one of the above-mentioned victory conditions, all other civilizations will usually declare war on it in an attempt to delay or stop it from winning. You should have a well-defended city if you are planning for a technology, culture or economic victory. If you are planning to use Domination you should have many armies and lots of defense units to cover your Tanks, Catapults or Artillery. Archers, Pikemen, Riflemen or Modern Infantry are all considered defensive units. An enemy victory due to the launching of a starship to Alpha Centauri can be prevented by capturing the enemy's capital. If an enemy captures your capital you will have to take it back before you can win this way. An enemy victory due to culture can be prevented by seizing some of the enemy's wonders or great people. An economic victory, however, cannot be prevented once a player has reached 20,000 gold, even if they lose gold or their capital. All that player's cities must be captured (or destroyed with a nuclear weapon) to fully eliminate the threat.Features  Civilization Revolution has 16 civilizations with corresponding historical leaders, 5 different difficulties, 4 different ways to win, streamlined time scale for quicker play, fully featured online play, including auto-matching, ranked games, and leaderboards, voice and vision chat, downloadable content, Achievements, a Civilopedia (a dictionary about every unit, great person, wonder, etc.), and advisers. The game also features a \"Game of the Week\" mode which will allow players to download a fixed game setup each week. Players are able to compete for the best single player score with this game setup. The \"save game\" option is disabled during Game of the Week play.Civilizations Featured in the Game  Each player can control one of 16 different civilizations, each with a different leader and its own specialties and abilities. Each civilization starts the game with a different special bonus that can be either a Technology, a Great Person, a building, or a Special Ability and then gets a new ability every time it enters a new era. The time the Civilization enters a new era is determined by the number of technologies the Civilization has successfully researched. The game begins in the Ancient Era, then progresses to the Medieval Era, the Industrial Era, and then the Modern Era. In a given game each civilization can have up to four bonuses that vary from civilization to civilization. Many of the civilizations have specific specialized units that only they can build, but, by contrast with previous games in the series, these are for looks only: special units do not possess abilities beyond the normal unit but may have varying stats. These units can be upgraded like other units giving them special abilities. There are also NPC barbarians who will wage war with all civilizations in the game until the globe is conquered with all civilizations being destroyed. If all Barbarian villages are destroyed no new ones appear. As a variation from some of the PC versions, barbarians now live in villages and will attack from them. Also, the level of barbarian activity cannot be adjusted as in previous games, though the level of barbarian activity changes in certain scenarios.Native Villages  Native villages are scattered across the map with three different visual representations: Igloo, Teepee and Jungle Hut. When entered by a unit, including a fly-over by an air unit, the village disappears and the villagers reward the player.Single Player  The single player of Civilization Revolution starts with the founding of a single city in 4000 B.C. to the Space Age in 2100 A.D. Players then expand their empires and research new technologies. The player has four different ways to win and is competing against four opposing AI civilizations. There are scenarios that do tweak the rules such as extra barbarians, all technologies already discovered, and more.Multiplayer  Civilization Revolution features some robust multiplayer options, including matchmaking and ranked games for up to four players (in free-for-all, one-on-one, and two-on-two team battle modes), as well as leaderboards and support for voice and video chat. Although many critics and players agree that the multiplayer is slow, there is an option to enable a turn timer such as in chess to attempt to make the game go faster, and one can also use the diplomacy panel and the city screen during other players' turns. Split screen multiplayer is not supported, but system link (on the Xbox 360) is.Downloadable Content  For the Xbox 360, Nintendo DS and PlayStation 3 versions, each week a new Firaxis-created scenario will become available to players for download. Players compete to earn the best Civilization Revolution leaderboard score for that scenario during that week. Firaxis has also released DLC for PS3 and Xbox 360 which includes wonders, relics, and even specific maps such as deserts, continent look-alikes and several others. New wonders include the Tower of Babel\u00a0and\u00a0the Leaning Tower of Pisa among others, which can be utilized in game like any other wonder. There was also DLC for the iPad and iPhone versions, which added multiplayer support, new wonders (the Taj Mahal, Lighthouse of Alexandria, Statue of Liberty, and Sydney Opera House), new buildings, and new units.Reception  The game received mostly positive reviews by critics. As of October 30, 2008, Metacritic lists Civilization Revolution at 85% for the PS3, 84% for the Xbox 360, and 81% for the Nintendo DS. GameInformer magazine gave the game a 9/10, stating that the controls work very well on the consoles, and, while the game is simpler than Civilization IV, the faster playability is very enjoyable. GameSpot gave the 360 and PS3 versions a 9.0/10 and an editor's choice award, praising its gameplay and visual design but found the multiplayer to be slow. IGN gave it an 8.8/10. Game Revolution gave it a B-. PlayStation: The Official Magazine gave the PS3 version a 4/5.Awards Previews Postponement/Cancellation of Wii Edition  On February 4, 2008,\u00a02K Games and Firaxis announced that the Wii version of Civilization Revolution was put on indefinite hold due to lack of manpower and no PlayStation 2 or PlayStation Portable editions of the game to share assets with. Firaxis programmer Scott Lewis explained, \"CivRev was originally a Xbox 360/PS3 project and was in development for over a year before the Wii/DS platforms were added. The result was that the time and effort it would have taken to remake a game built for higher-end hardware from the ground up would simply have been too costly.\" On June 10, 2008, Sid Meier reaffirmed plans to develop a Wii version, stating that Firaxis had \"no intentions of turning backs on the Wii version.\"Free on Xbox Live? Sequel External links Unit  A unit is something that can be built in one of your cities and can move over tiles. Most are military, but the term includes peaceful people and equipment such as explorers and caravans. In general there are land, air and sea-based units. The basic mechanics have been the same for all the games up until Civilization V. In Civ5, only one military unit is allowed to occupy a tile at a time. The limit applies to non-military units as well, but a military unit and a civilian unit may both occupy the same tile at the same time. Call to Power has a limit of 9 units per tile (including cities).Movement  Generally each unit can move and/or attack on each turn. Each type of unit has a basic number of movement points per turn, which may be used up in the first step or attack. Terrain and the presence of rivers, roads or railroads may affect the number of movement points used. In the original Civilization, there is some randomness in the ability of a unit to move if it has only a fraction (e.g. two-thirds) of a movement point left, and sometimes a unit will be unable to enter a mountain square on a given turn even if it has not moved in that turn. Land units must move only onto land tiles (or onto ships except in Civilization V), sea units only onto sea tiles, but where a block of four tiles has two of each arranged alternately (i.e. opposite) any unit may cross the common corner even if it shows as an isthmus. Air units may use any tiles, and if allowed to pause at the end of one turn outside a city or carrier or airbase they may be over water.Bombardment  Civilization III introduced the concept of bombardment, i.e. ranged attack, attack from a distance. In the original Civilization and Civilization II no such concept existed, but it appeared in Civilization: Call to Power. C-evo uses the term differently: air and naval units are not allowed to enter an unguarded city but may attack it and reduce its population one point per hit unless it has City Walls.Strengths  In most games, units have defined defensive strength and defined attack strength. In the original Civilization, for example, several units have a defensive strength of 1, with the phalanx 2 and the musketeers 3, and mechanized infantry the strongest at 6, while attack strengths start at 1 and go up to 10 for land units, 12 for bombers, and 18 for battleships. Various factors such as veteran status, city walls, and terrain can increase the effective strengths for a particular engagement, while from Civilization II onwards a unit's amount of damage may reduce its strength. Civilization IV consolidated units' attack and defense values into just one strength value, and Civilization V and Civilization VI have carried on this tradition.Maximum number  In the original Civilization no nation may build more than about 125 units. The precise number may depend on the program's accuracy in counting units, where the F2 function often shows a different number from what the player can find on the map.See also ", "Dark Souls Wiki": "Dark Souls Wiki Classes (Dark Souls)  Classes are an aspect of gameplay in Dark Souls and a part of Character Creation. The player's beginning class can differ in terms of Soul Level and statistics. However, classes matter very little after the first few levels of the game, and the player will ultimately be able to level their character into any type of build, meaning there is no \"wrong\" class to choose. Beyond stats, classes determine the starting weapon, shield and armor of the player, as well as extra items in some cases.Classes Warrior  Warriors are weapon experts with great Strength and Dexterity. Starting Equipment:Knight  Knights have high Health. They are heavily armored and hard to knock down. Starting Equipment:Wanderer  Wanderers are dexterous, Scimitar wielding characters. Starting Equipment:Thief  Thieves come equipped with the Master Key, have very high starting Dexterity and are equipped with the Bandit's Knife, making them excel at critical hits. Starting Equipment:Bandit  Bandits have high Strength and wield heavy Battle Axes. Starting Equipment:Hunter  Hunters have high Dexterity and are skilled in both ranged and melee combat. Starting Equipment:Sorcerer  Sorcerers have very high Intelligence and cast sorceries learned at the Vinheim Dragon School. Starting Spell: Soul Arrow Starting Equipment:Pyromancer  Pyromancers from the Great Swamp. They cast pyromancy and wield small Hand Axes. Starting Spell: Fireball Starting Equipment:Cleric  Clerics cast healing miracles and wield Maces. Starting Spell: Heal Starting Equipment:Deprived  The deprived come equipped with nothing but a Club and an old wooden Plank Shield, but have all stats at 11 which makes them a flexible and adaptable class despite starting out with poor equipment. Starting Equipment:Weapons (Dark Souls)  Weapons are a vital type of equipment in Dark Souls. Weapons include any objects wielded in the right or left hand and utilized in combat, including shields. Whichever weapon is in the right hand is used to attack, while the weapon in the left hand is usually utilized to block or parry, although in some cases it can also be used to attack. Despite this conglomeration, traditional weapons such as swords invariably have high attack power and low defensive power, while shields are invariably the other way around. If a sword is placed in the left hand, for example, and used to block, only its damage resistance and stability will affect its blocking effectiveness. In addition to attacking, a weapon can either block or parry when equipped in the left hand but not both at the same time; for example, scimitars can only parry or attack, but not block. Different weapons have different movesets depending on which hand they are equipped in.Attack Types and Parameters  All weapons have an Attack Type, otherwise known as a damage type, and can have values in Physical, Magic, Fire, and Lightning Damage. Some weapons have varying movesets, or attacks, and each move may inflict a different type of physical damage. For example, some daggers inflict Slash or Thrust Damage depending on which attack is used. Weapons have parameters that are required to be met in order to be wielded properly. These are usually Strength and Dexterity but can also include Intelligence or Faith. If the Strength stat isn't met, two-handing the weapon will decrease the requirement, effectively increasing the player's Strength by a factor of 1.5. Many weapons also have parameter bonuses that scale with corresponding attributes, providing a higher attack rating.Weapon Types  All weapons have a weapon type that aid the player in determining the basic functionality of that weapon. Weapons of the same weapon type usually have similar movesets and often inflict the same type of damage. Weapons of the same type may also have different attack speeds and stun rates. The level at which the weapon is reinforced will also affect the weapon's stun rate.Weapons Axes Bows Crossbows Curved Greatswords Curved Swords Daggers Gauntlets Great Hammers Greataxes Greatswords Halberds Hammers Katanas Spears Straight Swords Thrusting Swords Ultra Greatswords Whips Catalysts Talismans Other Removed Weapons  Asterisks ( * ) denote weapons that can only be obtained with the Prepare to Die Edition or Artorias of the Abyss DLC.Weapon Types (Dark Souls)  Weapon types are a property of weapons in Dark Souls. All weapons have a weapon type that aids the player in determining the basic functionality of that weapon. Weapons of the same weapon type have similar forms of attack.List of weapon types Swords Axes Polearms Hammers Other melee Ranged Casting Instruments  Talismans are used to cast miracles and can also be used as melee weapons when executing their strong attack, inflicting Strike Damage.Lordran  Lordran is the setting for Dark Souls.Lore  Lordran is the land of the ancient lords and was once home to Gwyn, the Lord of Sunlight; Nito, the First of the Dead; The Witch of Izalith; Seath the Scaleless; and their many brethren and faithful servants. It is stated in ancient legend, that the Chosen Undead will make pilgrimage to Lordran from the Undead Asylum. However, many dangers await those who wish to seek their fate in its various cities, forests and dungeons.See Also Dark Souls  Dark Souls is a video game developed by From Software. The game has been published on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 by Namco Bandai Games. It was previously developed under the codename Project Dark and is the spiritual successor to\u00a0Demon's Souls.\u00a0It also uses an updated variant of said game's engine. Dark Souls was released in Japan for the PlayStation 3, on September 15, 2011; it was released for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 on October 4 in North America and on October 7 in Europe.Gameplay  Dark Souls focuses on dungeon exploring and the tension and fear that arise when players encounter enemies in this setting. The game is a spiritual successor to Demon's Souls, which in turn is considered a spiritual successor to the King's Field games. The game takes place in an open world environment and uses a third-person perspective. The player battles using various weapons and strategies to survive in a dark fantasy world. Online features allow players to share the play experience without need for direct communication. With respect to Demon's Souls, there are more weapons, spells, and new classes. Before release, it was also said to be \"significantly harder\", with more enemies and more difficult encounters. It includes leaving messages to other players, seeing others' deaths, and player versus player (as well as a new co-op system); similar to the online functions in Demon's Souls. The items the player uses in these games are significantly different.Prepare to Die Edition  Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition is the PC re-release of the game that was, until its release, solely available on the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360. The game released on August 24th, 2012 and includes the Artorias of the Abyss mini-expansion that includes new bosses, weapons and locations. The Artorias of the Abyss DLC is also available as a separate download for Xbox 360 and PS3 owners.Minimum system requirements  CPU: AMD Phenom II X2 545 3.0 GHz - Intel Core 2 Duo E6850 3.0 GHz\nRAM: 2 GB\nVGA: ATI Radeon HD 4870 - GeForce 9800 GTX+\nDX: 9.0c\nOS: Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7 or newer\nHDD: 4 GB\nSound: Direct Sound Compatible\nNetwork: Online play requires software installation of and log-in to Games For Windows - LIVE (online play is not required to play the game but is recommended)Dark Souls Remastered  In a surprise Nintendo Direct conference on January 11, 2018, it was announced Dark Souls would be remastered and ported to the Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC. The remaster released on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on May 24 and 25, 2018. The Nintendo Switch release was originally planned for May 25 as well, and was delayed to summer 2018. On August 14, 2018, it was announced that the Switch version would be releasing on October 19, 2018. \u2600also comes with improved shadow and music effects The remaster would include the Artorias of the Abyss DLC as well and improved frame-rate and graphics, and will run at 60 frames per second on both consoles and PC. The multiplayer component would receive dedicated servers for all four platforms, with up to 6 players. The game will cost $39.99 US but offers a 50% discount for owners of the original Dark Souls on PC.Reception  Dark Souls received critical acclaim, earning an 89 on Metacritic. IGN gave the game a 9/10, whilst GameSpot gave the game a 9.5/10. Many players had divided opinions, saying that the game was too hard, too boring, and uninteresting: others claimed\u00a0Dark Souls to be one of the best RPGs of all time. David Houghton from Gamesradar rated it as the\u00a0greatest game of all time out of 100 games. Edge\u00a0magazine named\u00a0Dark Souls\u00a0the best game of the\u00a0seventh generation of games consoles. In September 2015,\u00a0Dark Souls\u00a0topped the magazine's special issue\u00a0The 100 Greatest Videogames.Sequels and other media  The success of Dark Souls soon spawned two sequels, Dark Souls II released in 2014 (and later Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin in 2015), and Dark Souls III released in 2016. An abundance of merchandise such as books and figures were also created under the brand. More notably, a Dark Souls comic series published by Titan Comics began publication in 2016, with several other comics subsequently being released in later years.References External links Dragon Slayer Ornstein and Executioner Smough  Dragon Slayer Ornstein and Executioner Smough are a pair of bosses that guard Princess Gwynevere in Anor Londo. Alongside Hawkeye Gough, Artorias the Abysswalker, and Lord's Blade Ciaran (all of whom appear in the Artorias of the Abyss DLC), Dragonslayer Ornstein was one of Gwyn's four knights.Summoning  It's possible to summon Solaire of Astora to help in the fight. His summon sign can be found on top of a small platform connected to the stairs to the left, when facing the fog door (the platform below the archer knight). If he starts the encounter at full health, Solaire can generally solo one of the bosses, as long as he's not attacked by the other (i.e., if the player keeps the other boss busy). Note that this can make it harder to ensure a specific kill order (necessary to determine the final loot, as described below), as there is no way for the player to tell Solaire to stop attacking a specific boss.Strategies First Phase: Ornstein and Smough  The player must fight both at the same time. When one is killed, the other absorbs some of his power, receiving an HP, damage, and resistance boost, and healing back to 100%. He will also take on a physical characteristic of his fallen comrade: Ornstein grows in size while Smough is imbued with lightning. Having a summoned phantom can make the fight significantly easier, as it allows the bosses to be fought separately. Note, however, that there's no advantage in damaging both bosses during the first phase (as mentioned above, the surviving boss' HP goes back to 100% when the second phase begins). The role of the second player is simply to keep one of the bosses busy while the other is killed. When fighting alone, one of the safest strategies is to kite the bosses around the outside of the room, keeping both in view and using the pillars to block their charging attacks while whittling them down with hit-and-run tactics. As Ornstein is the faster of the pair, he will usually be able to catch up to the player quickly. The player can then choose to focus down Ornstein while Smough attempts to navigate around the pillars, or double back to Smough after getting Ornstein away from him and using the short window of separation to attack him before Ornstein returns. Ornstein's moveset consists largely of dashing and thrusting attacks, meaning that dodging to his sides is more effective than attempting to roll away. He is faster and more nimble though, so he can also be harder to hit. As well, he can issue Lightning blasts from his spear at range, making him a serious threat at any distance. Smough is the tougher of the two, but his hammer is capable of dealing tremendous damage should it connect. Because the hitbox is centered on the head of the hammer, it is best to dodge towards or away from him, as getting within the arc of his hammer's horizontal swings can cause them to miss entirely. Beware, as he also has a dangerous charge attack that he can use if the player is not within striking distance of his hammer. Killing Ornstein first is generally regarded as making the encounter easier to win, since Smough has more weaknesses and is slower than his partner in the second phase. However, killing Smough first will yield the Leo Ring, which is a useful ring for certain builds. For melee builds, using a weapon with good reach (such as a spear, halberd or a sword with a fast thrusting attack) will make it significantly easier to hit the bosses when they are near a pillar. Note that both bosses can hit through the pillars with some of their attacks. Ranged builds using the pillars to control the movement of the bosses should note that not all pillars are the same height; some will block projectiles while others will not.Second Phase 1: Lightning Smough  If Ornstein is defeated first, Smough will gain Lightning attacks with his hammer, though his moveset does not change appreciably. He is still quite slow and his attacks are still horizontally focused, so dodging in and out is still a sound strategy. Be wary of his Banzai Drop in this phase, as it creates a Lightning explosion upon impact, dealing damage in a large area around him.Second Phase 2: Super Ornstein  If Smough is defeated first, Ornstein will increase greatly in size, drastically changing his moveset in the process. The key to defeating Super Ornstein is to keep in mind that while he has absorbed Smough's strengths, he has also inherited his weaknesses: Super Ornstein is much slower, and has trouble navigating around pillars. Like other large bosses, he also has trouble hitting enemies that are directly under him, though his Lightning Banzai Drop helps to counteract this. Try to stay extremely close to Super Ornstein and attack his legs, dodging out when he performs the Lightning Banzai Drop.Notes Boss information Ornstein Swinging Combo  Ornstein swings his spear up to four times in a row. This attack can be blocked, and generally offers a good chance to counter-attack.Jumping Attack  Ornstein jumps up, and then either stabs at the player, or smashes his spear into the ground where the player is standing. Both deal the same amount of damage, and can be blocked.Charging Spear  Ornstein glides towards the player, and then stabs with his spear. The attack can be blocked or dodged, and a counterattack is possible to achieve. Note that this attack can (rarely) cause Ornstein to move through a pillar.Lightning Spear Charge  Rare attack that is identical to Charging Spear, except Ornstein imbues his spear with lightning before charging.Lightning Banzai Drop  Only used if Smough was killed first. Ornstein jumps up, pauses mid-air, then falls onto the ground, causing a wide lightning field created from the point of impact. This cannot be fully blocked, and can only be dodged by keeping one's distance. Smough's distinct laughter can be heard during this attack.Quick Lightning Spear  Ornstein uses his weapon's power to shoot a small burst of lightning at the player. This attack is rarely used.Heavy Lightning Spear  Ornstein charges up a lightning bolt that he fires at the player. This Lightning Bolt is unusually slow once fired and has strong homing capabilities.Lightning Impale  In Ornstein's large form, he will charge his spear with lightning, and then lunge at the player in a quick stabbing motion. If this attack connects, Ornstein will raise the player and release the charged lightning, dealing huge amounts of damage.Smough Joust  Smough charges at the player with his hammer, then swings it upwards diagonally when he reaches the player. This deals heavy damage, especially when in lightning form. It can be avoided by running directly away or with the right dodging speed. Blocking will break the player's guard if they are using a shield of inadequate stability. While pillars will block Smough's movement, the hammer itself will go through the pillar.Swing  Smough swings his weapon. It is possible to roll under this attack and start attacking before Smough has time to recover. Blocking this attack may use a large amount of stamina. May follow up with a second swing.Smash  Smough slowly raises his weapon and then hammers the ground in front of him. This attack can go through pillars. May follow up with a swing.Jumping Hammer  Smough jumps into the air and then hammers the ground as close to the player as he can get. This can be avoided by rolling in any direction while Smough is airborne.Banzai Drop  Smough jumps into the air and then crashes into the ground below. Smough takes a while to recover after using this attack. When in his more powerful form, there is a lightning area of effect upon landing. The only way to fully avoid the lightning damage is to roll when Smough lands on the floor. It can also be partially blocked with a shield.Trivia Bosses Covenant  A covenant is a faction that a player may join in Dark Souls. Being part of a covenant grants various benefits, though it also imposes certain rules on the player. Breaking said rules can lead to negative effects. Covenants may also have an effect on the player's online interactions.General information  There are nine covenants in all. Some covenants have four ranks, from 0 to +3. Ranking up in a covenant can bring additional rewards.\u00a0 Attacking or killing covenant members counts as a betrayal, resulting in expulsion.Changing covenants  Players may only join one covenant at a time. Should players wish to join a different covenant, it is necessary to break their contract with their previous covenant first, either through betrayal or through Oswald, the pardoner. The latter is highly recommended as doing so has less repercussions, while the former can cause several problems, such as being unable to rejoin the covenant until the player's sins are pardoned for a hefty price. Upon leaving a covenant, even with the Oswald method, half of the progress the player has made in ranking up in the covenant is lost, should they wish to rejoin later. For example, a rank requiring 20 humanity will be reduced to 10 if one should rejoin and want to attain the previously held rank.Invaders  Invading is a form of PvE and PvP in Dark Souls.General information  When playing the game, the player may be invaded if certain parameters are met. While invaded by characters or other players, Fog Doors appear in the general area and it becomes impossible to exit the game through the in-game menu. Invaders are still mortal to environmental hazards and it is possible to bait a Player Invader towards the Hellkite Bridge and have the Drake incinerate the Invader with its initial fly-by attack. Also, Invaders are not immune to the lava in Lost Izalith or the poison swamps in Blighttown and players can lure Invaders into these hazards to kill them slowly. Once the process of invading another world is initiated, it cannot be cancelled, with the exception of dying or exiting the game.Character invaders  While exploring in human\u00a0form, there are certain areas of the game that will trigger an invasion by a character Black Phantom, otherwise known as Red Phantoms. These Black Phantoms will drop some combination of souls, humanity, and items, if applicable. These encounters will not occur while in Hollowed form, and will no longer trigger once the area boss is killed. Some NPC Invaders have a non-phantom version of themselves somewhere in the game world.Player invaders  If playing Online while exploring in non-hollow form, the world may be invaded by another player.Distinguishing invaders  Players may only invade one's world while playing online. NPC, or character Invaders always trigger when exploring in a certain area, and their name will exactly match their non-phantom version from the game world. Character Invaders can also invade even when playing offline. Character Invaders will attack on sight, and not stop attacking at any point until either the Player or the Invader is dead.

While players will generally end up fighting most of the bosses, not all of them need to be killed in order to beat the game. In addition to bosses, there are a number of enemies that don't respawn upon death and are sometimes referred to as minibosses.Bosses Lordran  Undead Asylum Undead Burg/Parish The Depths Blighttown/Quelaag's Domain Darkroot Garden Sen's Fortress Anor Londo Painted World of Ariamis The Duke's Archives/Crystal Cave The Catacombs Tomb of the Giants New Londo Ruins Demon Ruins Lost Izalith Kiln of the First FlameOolacile  Sanctuary Garden Royal Wood Chasm of the Abyss Asterisks (*) denote optional bosses. Daggers (\u2020) denote bosses found only in the Artorias of the Abyss DLC.Knight Artorias  Knight Artorias, also known as Artorias the Abysswalker, is a boss in Dark Souls. He is exclusive to the\u00a0Artorias of the Abyss\u00a0DLC.Location  Knight Artorias is located in the coliseum area of Oolacile Township, at the end of the Royal Wood.Description  By the time the Chosen Undead encounters him, Artorias is shown to have already been corrupted by the Abyss with his armor looking putrefied, oozing an aura of darkness.\u00a0His crippled arm is likely the result of Artorias halting the spread from devouring his wolf companion by means of a now missing shield. He possesses a greatsword that has also been consumed, yet is still far from ineffective. Having lost his sanity, the knight moves about in an untamed manner as he howls beneath the blue shroud of his helm.Lore  Sir Artorias the Abysswalker was one of the Four Knights of Lord Gwyn. He only makes an appearance in the past, as he is deceased by the time the Chosen Undead escapes the Undead Asylum. Knight Artorias wore distinctive armor, as well as the Wolf Ring, and brandished his Greatsword and Greatshield. He is known to have been a friend to Alvina of the Forest Hunter covenant. Sif, the Great Grey Wolf was his companion, now guarding his grave and keeping the Covenant of Artorias ring in his possession. Artorias hunted the Darkwraiths and was able to traverse the Abyss with the power of his ring, which he obtained after making a covenant with the beasts there, preventing him from being swallowed by the void, but cursing his sword in the process. In recognition of his actions, he was awarded one of Anor Londo's treasures - a Silver Pendant that allowed him to repel Dark sorceries. When Oolacile became threatened by the Abyss created by Manus, Artorias and his wolf companion Sif arrived there in an attempt to save Oolacile and rescue the abducted\u00a0Princess Dusk. However, the two were overwhelmed, and Artorias sacrificed himself to protect Sif using his Cleansing Greatshield, erecting a barrier around the young wolf. Swallowed by the Dark, he became corrupted along with his already-cursed sword. He was then laid to rest by the Chosen Undead after their encounter in the coliseum of Oolacile. Once defeated, Hawkeye Gough mentions the player defeating Artorias, and speaks of him when talked to multiple times. His legacy as a hero lasted for centuries. By the time of Lothric, there was the Undead Legion of Farron, who were commonly called the Abyss Watchers. They partook of wolf blood, and it is said that their souls are bound together and are one with the soul of the \"wolf blood master\", most likely Artorias. Wielding greatswords modeled after his, and fighting in wild ferocious styles, the Legion fought a veritable war with the dark of the Abyss that their master had fought ages past.Melee strategy  While this boss is rather difficult to predict, he does have a few signs for his attacks, and well-timed rolls prove useful here. Being able to fast-roll is highly advised but not necessary. The player can place themself away from him by about twice his reach at all times, even for melee.Aerial attacks  When he uses his Somersault Slam attack, the player will want to roll to the right as the camera tilts upward while locked onto him. The player can do this three times and then get in one or two attacks (based on one's weapon) after the third attack lands. Avoid attacking after his Steadfast Leap. Instead use that opportunity to heal or get some distance from him.Standing attacks  When he uses his Overhand Smash, roll to the right. While he leaves himself open for a frames, he will usually follow up with his Spinning Slash attack. Therefore, it is best to get some distance from him instead as the Spinning Slash attack is difficult to get away from when it begins.Charging attacks  With his Charging Slash move the player will always want to roll backwards from where he intends to land the attack. After successfully dodging this attack, the player will be able to get one or two hits on him. His Heavy Thrust attack will need to be side dodged. Depending on which way he turns during the charge, the player will need to dodge the opposite way. After the dodge, he has a long recovery time and the player should be able to get two or three hits in.Other attacks  When the player is behind Artorias, he may use his Abyss Sludge attack. This move does little damage but can stun. If timed right, the player can roll forward through the attack and get a hit on him, then immediately retreat. After Artorias has lost 1/3 of his health, he will start to use his Wrath of the Abyss power up. If left alone, he will do much more damage after he completes the power up for a limited time, potentially one-shotting the player. If the player can get close fast enough, they can stun him out of his power up before it's completed by hitting him repeatedly. If the player doesn't do enough damage fast enough, he will hit them with an area of effect blast attack that will knock the player on their back. The best bet is to use a heavy, high damage weapon and stop him from gaining his attack buff. Another, safer way is to equip a bow in the off-hand and shoot him repeatedly while he is charging up. Yet another way is to equip Throwing Knives and use those in quick succession to stagger him.Boss information Attacks Steadfast Leap  Artorias crouches, then leaps high into the air towards the player, causing damage in a small\u00a0area of effect around him. Rolling or moving towards him instead of away can increase one's chance of successfully dodging before he lands.Somersault Slam  Artorias somersaults into the air after which he slams his sword down vertically. He can repeat this up to three times. Roll to the side to avoid it. The player can be stun-locked in this combo.Overhand Smash  Slams his sword overhead and towards the ground; high staggering power that leaves his guard open for a short time after it lands.Charging Slash  Artorias moves toward the player while swinging his sword 360 degrees. He presents an opportunity to be attacked after the player dodges his swing.Heavy Thrust  Pauses before performing a heavy, medium range thrust towards the player. If it connects, it can hit twice, dealing heavy damage and knocking the player to the ground.Spinning Slash  Artorias quickly spins, completing a full revolution. It has the potential to connect twice.Abyss Sludge  Artorias throws a staggering sludge in a wide arc, a few feet in front of him. Usually performed if positioned behind him.Wrath of the Abyss  Activates in intervals after approximately 20% of his total health is reduced. After rolling away, he will slowly build up dark magic energy, presenting ample time for retaliation, potentially staggering him, or to apply augmentations to one's weapon or self. A single Sunlight Spear can stagger him and prevent this build up from finalizing. If the player does not stagger him, he will release an explosion that does magic damage in a mid-ranged area of effect all around him. Artorias' attack speed, area of effect and damage are enhanced for a limited time afterwards. These effects can stack.\u00a0 In addition to the health thresholds, this attack has a time interval between uses, in that if Artorias is left undamaged for a period of time, he will re-activate Wrath of the Abyss.Notes Trivia References Gwyn, Lord of Cinder  Gwyn, Lord of Cinder is the final boss in Dark Souls and one of the original four lords who helped defeat the dragons.Description  Lord Gwyn wears an impressive set of royal drapings, with gold bands on his arms, and a crown atop his head. On his feet are what appear to be a form of moccasins and anklets, and he wields a greatsword imbued with the power of light and of the First Flame, which he uses to adequate effect. His face is that of an aged man with calm eyes, and he has an impressively long, grey beard and hair of the same nature. When the Chosen Undead fights Gwyn in the Kiln of the First Flame, Gwyn appears to be Hollow, evident by his haggard appearance, charred skin and missing eyes.Location  Lord Gwyn can be found at the Kiln of the First Flame.Summoning  It is possible to summon Solaire of Astora to help in the fight if he survived in Lost Izalith. His summon sign can be found at the top of the staircase from Gwyn.Lore Dark Souls History  Before the flame existed, little of Gwyn's life is known, save that he had an uncle named Lloyd. He was surrounded by knights when he found the flame, and was dressed in his regalia, so it is possible that he may have been a king long before that moment. At the dawn of the\u00a0Age of Fire, Gwyn discovered a\u00a0Lord Soul\u00a0along with the Furtive Pygmy, Gravelord Nito,\u00a0and the\u00a0Witch of Izalith. His soul allowed him to manipulate light, and generate a substance called lightning. They allied with\u00a0Seath the Scaleless\u00a0and amassed an army, and with their power, challenged the\u00a0Everlasting Dragons\u00a0for dominion of the\u00a0World. His mighty bolts peeled apart their ancient scales, allowing them to be killed by other attacks, and they were ultimately defeated, but not eliminated. And thus the Age of Fire began, with Gwyn becoming the king of Lordran. He lived with his clan, who became a new and varied race known as Gods, in their city of Anor Londo. They often hunted the descendants of the dragons for sport, for which many of their powers were developed. This did not include Seath, for he received recognition for his deeds, and was made a part of the nobility. When the flames began to fade, Gwyn and the other Lords did all they could to find a solution. The Witch of Izalith attempted to recreate the First Flame from her own Lord's Soul, but the attempt went horribly awry, mutating the Witch into the terrible\u00a0Bed of Chaos, which spewed forth malformed demons whom Gwyn's faithful Silver Knights fought, but the flames of the demons charred their armor black, thus becoming Black Knights. Seeing no other choice, Gwyn left\u00a0Anor Londo\u00a0and traveled to the\u00a0Kiln of the First Flame, to link the First Flame, thus prolonging the Age of Fire.\u00a0When he left, he divided his own soul among his clan and his children,\u00a0and granted parts to both the\u00a0Four Kings\u00a0and Seath, along with others. In linking the flame, Gwyn sacrificed himself; with his powerful soul providing fuel for the flames, prolonging the Age of Fire. A great many of his Black Knights followed him into the Kiln and were reduced to ash when he linked the fire, wandering Lordran as disembodied spirits for eternity. His Lord Soul was able to keep the fire burning for centuries, but it left Gwyn to Hollow. It is implied that at least one thousand years have passed when the events of\u00a0Dark Souls\u00a0begin.\u00a0Gwynevere, Princess of Sunlight,\u00a0Kingseeker Frampt\u00a0and\u00a0Darkstalker Kaathe\u00a0give the\u00a0Chosen Undead\u00a0alternating viewpoints of Gwyn. Gwynevere claims that it is the Chosen Undead's duty to succeed Gwyn, stating that their success would \"avert further Undead sacrifices\"\u00a0and that without Fire, \"all shall be a frigid and frightful\u00a0Dark\"\u00a0\u2013 a perspective that Frampt shares.\u00a0As this Gwynevere is actually an illusion,\u00a0whether or not they are being entirely truthful is left unresolved. On the other hand, Kaathe asserts that the\u00a0Age of Dark\u00a0\u2013 the apparent \"age of men\" \u2013 would naturally follow the\u00a0Age of Fire, but Gwyn, in dire fear of both the Dark and humans, resisted the course of nature by sacrificing himself to link the Fire. Unlike Frampt, Kaathe believes it is the Chosen Undead's fate to \"destroy the fading Lord Gwyn, [...] become the Fourth Lord, [and] usher in an Age of Dark\".Army  In the beginning Gwyn's army comprised only of Silver Knights. Once the demons were born however many of the knights fought against them, turning their armour black which resulted in them being renamed as Black Knights. A great many of them accompanied Gwyn to kiln of the first flame where they were burnt to ashes and became the disembodied spirits that roam\u00a0Lordran. The remaining Silver Knights guard\u00a0Anor Londo. He formed the\u00a0Four Knights of Gwyn:\u00a0Dragonslayer Ornstein, the believed captain of the guard;\u00a0Hawkeye Gough, commander of the Dragonslayers;\u00a0Lord's Blade Ciaran, the assassin;\u00a0and the legendary Knight,\u00a0Artorias the Abysswalker. Gwyn's friend,\u00a0Havel the Rock, was a general over his own warriors, which were presumably part of Gwyn's army.\u00a0Friend-wise, Kaathe states that Frampt \"lost his sense\" and befriended Gwyn.Family  Gwyn is the nephew of\u00a0Allfather Lloyd\u00a0and father of\u00a0Dark Sun Gwyndolin, a son whom he raised as a daughter,\u00a0and two actual daughters\u00a0Gwynevere, Princess of Sunlight and Filianore.\u00a0His other son was a god of war, who inherited the sunlight through his status as firstborn. However, he sided with the Ancient Dragons, for which he was promptly stripped of his deific status and all references to him, including his very name, were erased from Lordran and the Annals of History.Company Captain Yorshka is a possible daughter of Gwyn, although considering the facts that Gwyndolin gave her a name and that she doesn't know much about the world, this may not be true - rather, she could be an adoptive daughter.Dark Souls II  Although not explicitly stated, it is implied that the events of\u00a0Dark Souls II\u00a0take place centuries or millennia later\u00a0\u2013 more than enough time for several kingdoms to rise and fall in the time between. It is also shown that regardless of the Chosen Undead's decision to link the Fire or not following Gwyn's death, the cycle of Light and Dark still exists. At this point, Gwyn's name has long been forgotten \u2013 only recalled as the God of Sun\u00a0\u2013 and his only legacies are four of his surviving\u00a0miracles:\u00a0Lightning Spear,\u00a0Great Lightning Spear,\u00a0Sunlight Spear, and\u00a0Blinding Bolt. The Sunlight Spear is stated to be \"one of the ancient original miracles, said to have existed from the infancy of the very world\",\u00a0but its relation to Gwyn is not mentioned, further reinforcing him being past recollection. Furthermore, the Blinding Bolt miracle was said to be created and then later forbidden by him. The Old King Soul is dropped by the Old Iron King if he is defeated at bonfire intensity 2+. The soul is described as a \"once magnificent soul\" that can be used to make either the Blinding Bolt miracle or a Dragonslayer Greatbow, thereby creating some connection between the Old Iron King and Gwyn.When players encountered Aldia, Scholar of the First Sin, he refers to Gwyn as the \"Lord of Light\" who \"altered the natural order and began the cycle of light and dark.\" He expresses his outrage at Gwyn for making men lesser than their original purpose, and elaborates that his acts were a lie - however The First Sin itself is never defined by name, leaving the dialogue of \"Once, the Lord of Light banished Dark, and all that stemmed from Humanity\" up to interpretation as to what it references.Dark Souls III  When Dark Souls III begins Gwyn's remaining children are either scattered, dead or killed by Aldrich, Devourer of Gods. The Great Cathedral of Anor Londo has fallen into disrepair and his last remaining son, Gwyndolin has taken his father's title as King of the Gods. However, even Gwyndolin is not safe; shortly before the events of the game, a coup by Pontiff Sulyvahn and Aldrich led to him being poisoned, and then devoured by the latter. Gwyn is (presumably) reincarnated, along with all other Lords of Cinder who followed him, in the Soul of Cinder. This last defense against the Ashen One is an amalgamation of all Lords of Cinder who ever linked the First Flame. Using Gwyn's fighting style after its primary attacks proved fruitless, the Soul of Cinder serves as the final boss of Dark Souls III.Strategies  Health and Stamina management are a must in this fight, as Gwyn will rarely give the player any chances to heal. It is heavily advisable to use a fast weapon to attack with, preferably one that drains little stamina. Heavy weapons are not recommended for this fight. It may be hard for the player to find a proper opening to fight back or heal as a result of Gwyn actively seeking the player. His attacks deal a great amount of damage if they connect. If blocked, his attacks will still deal considerable damage to the player as a result of the flame damage his sword deals. A good way to reduce the damage to a slight margin is by using shields with high fire defense, such as\u00a0the Black Iron Greatshield or the Black Knight Shield, which can be dropped by the nearby Black Knights; however, care should still be taken as blocking a full attack chain will cost a lot of stamina and may eventually result in losing health or dying. The Gold-Hemmed Black Set can further negate the fire damage at the cost of less physical defense against his attacks. The pillars in the arena can be used to block his attacks, however, Gwyn will easily move around them and continue attacking. It is possible for him to keep attacking a pillar that is blocking his path, giving the player a chance to heal, however, he may simply go around it. Parrying is a high-risk, but incredibly efficient strategy. All of Gwyn's attacks, minus the kick and grab, can be parried. Using the Hornet Ring, a single riposte can erase a large fraction of Gwyn's health. However, any mistakes can end up badly for the player. Therefore, it may be preferable to opt for heavier armor for this strategy, as dodging is not the main tactic, and the additional poise and defense leaves some margin for error. It is ideal to block the first hit of his combo, and parry the telegraphed second hit. After performing a riposte, the player will have just enough time to Estus heal. Summoning Solaire or other players can help ease the battle, giving a chance to heal or apply buffs. For Solaire, he may be able to land several hits before dying. By using the Black Knight Halberd or a spear type weapon you can hit Gwyn through the pillars and take little damage from his attacks. MELEE STRATEGY While Gwyn does not provide for a lot of openings, especially if wielding a slow weapon like the Zweihander, it is possible, through using a shield with enough stability and having enough fire resistance, to use a circling strategy. Keeping very close to Gwyn and keeping a shield up, the player can be dealt very little damage by the flaming sword by constantly strafing to the player's left. When Gwyn attempts to grab the player or kick them, the slower animation should enable the player to get behind Gwyn's back, thus making the attack miss. At that point, there's a small window to get an attack in. With a weapon with a strong enough attack to break Gwyn's poise, the player then has a full second to finish the attack animation and get the shield back up, effectively never breaking their guard. Use of this strategy requires the player to keep a close look on their stamina bar. Regularly, though, the player will have to heal themselves, unless the fire damage is completely negated. Using the pillar strategy outlined above is quite efficient. It is a good idea to keep one's health high enough to that a grab attack can't kill with one hit. Therefore, having 20 estus flasks is recommended.Notes Boss information Attacks Dashing Thrust  Used by Gwyn while he's dashing. Although it is one of his linear attacks, it is possible he may switch to a slashing combo midway. It is also one of his best attacks in terms of tracking the player.Quad-Slash Combo  Gwyn performs this attack in quick succession and solid tracking. It begins with an angled slash, then a horizontal one, another angled and finally a horizontal slash once more. The angled attacks can be sidestepped if the player moves early enough.Kick  Triggered regularly when blocking close to Gwyn, it causes a large drain of stamina if it connects while blocking.Slash and Thrust  Occasionally Gwyn will interrupt his normal slash combo with a quick thrust afterwards. If it hits, the player will be stunned, leaving them open for further combos.Slashing Upper Combo  Starts with a powerful horizontal slash, which takes a large portion of stamina, followed by two more hits. The first two slashes can be difficult to evade.Charging Slash  A powerful slash used by Gwyn to break the player's guard.Instant Dash/Double Slash  A very fast attack, which comes out of Gwyn's instant dash when he glides towards the player before slashing twice.Explosive Hand  An unblockable grab attack that deals massive fire damage. It has a high horizontal hitbox, so it is possible to roll under it to avoid it. It's relatively slow and does not track well so player can simply walk backwards to avoid it. After knocking the player away, Gwyn will follow up with a jumping slash or dashing slash. It also leaves Gwyn open to attacks for a short time.Drops  Gwyn's armor, the Great Lord Set, can be purchased from Domhnall of Zena during the next playthrough.Trivia Music Footnotes References Enemies Gravelord Nito  Gravelord Nito, also known as Nito, The First of the Dead, is a boss, the leader of the Gravelord Servant covenant and one of the original Lords in the Dark Souls universe.Location  Gravelord Nito can be found at the end of the Tomb of the Giants.Description  Looking through the game's files reveals that Nito's body is that of an immensely sized human skeleton, though the ribcage is packed with bits of dead matter, and blown open as a result. The torso leans forwards as well, giving him a hunchback appearance, and his true skull is tucked into the dead matter and bones. His left leg is built like those on a dog or other four legged creature, while his right leg is humanlike, giving him a sort of handicap and reducing his movement to a slow limp. The other skeletons merely adorn him as armor, with his entire torso covered in ribcages and skulls, and arms and legs dangling all around him. What was once an all concealing cloak looking like black fur or feather, apparently conjured at will, is reduced to a tattered hairlike cloak. When dormant, Nito did not seem to wear it until after generating a glowing fume of lavender white power, likely the \"miasma of death and disease\" he is known for. His left hand is natural, his right is equipped with a triple bone forearm, which terminates in a sharpened bone blade covered with the miasma.Lore  Nito, the first of the dead, is one of the original Lords who found a Lord Soul at the dawn of the Age of Fire. His soul turned him into a living manifestation of illness and death, a mass of skeletons held together. He, along with the other Lords,\u00a0waged war against the Dragons, and helped issue the killing blow by unleashing a miasma of death and disease upon them. After the war with the dragons, Nito descended into the Catacombs, and slumbered within the Tomb of the Giants. Even in that state, he could administer the death of all life and offered much of the energy of his own soul to death itself.Travelers brave enough to find their way into his tomb would pay their respects and become a Gravelord Servant. They would use the Eyes of Death to cause hostile spirits to invade other worlds, spreading death throughout them, which allowed the multiplication of the Eyes of Death, which in turn allows death to increase exponentially. While Nito sees all death, and induces all death, his servants return with Eyes of Death to prove that they have done their tasks. In return for their service to him, Nito accepts these offerings, and presents his servants with more power It is thought that Nito possessed the Rite of Kindling, a power sacred to ancient clerics, which allowed them to strengthen the flame of Bonfires. In time before the player's mention, a being known as the \"Pinwheel\" stole this power of Nito, holding on to it until the Chosen Undead meets the Pinwheel. This power was also sought after by occultists who wished to abscond with the power of Nito, to destroy the Gods, and perhaps the other Lords, though their plot was foiled and they died in Nito's domain. These events are considered ancient history, in a timeline between the fall of Oolacile and the Chosen Undead's arrival. In their attempt to fill the Lordvessel with powerful souls, the Chosen Undead intrudes upon the underground cavern that housed the sarcophagus of Nito, who awakens and defends himself from his attacker. Even with him dead, his soul persists, as it is the manifestation of a fundamental concept. It is told that he is the creator of the Milfanito and the Fenito found in the Shrine of Amana and\u00a0Undead Crypt\u00a0respectively\u00a0in Dark Souls II, being referred to as the \"Great Dead One\". The Great Dead One created the Milfanito to comfort those bearing death and darkness, teaching the maidens a song for them to sing. The Fenito were created to ensure the deceased within the Undead Crypt rest undisturbed.Strategies  When falling into Nito's domain, some damage will be incurred. This can be negated through use of the Fall Control sorcery. If Fall Control is unavailable, make sure to heal once landed, preferably with Estus as the other forms might not be fast enough to avoid Nito's ranged attack. Nito is a very large, very slow boss with average HP. This makes large weapons and slow spells excellent candidates for dealing damage to him quickly. Nito's attacks often cause toxin and can be quite damaging, but almost all of them have a very long startup time and are easily avoidable. All of the attacks except the sword dance can be blocked. Nito is aided by some minor Skeletons initially, and Giant Skeletons if the player ventures too far from the place they fell down from. Both types of Skeletons resurrect after being killed, unless they are killed with a Divine weapon (even with a Divine weapon a Phantom can't kill the skeletons, only the Host can). They are no tougher than the Skeletons found throughout the Catacombs and the Tomb of the Giants, but may prove to be a fatal distraction to fighting Nito himself. Because Nito is so slow, it is a good idea to kill all of his minions with a Divine weapon before engaging with him, so the skeletons will not get in the way. As long as you are not close to him, the only attack you have to watch out for is his Gravelord Greatsword (listen for the scream and start running). Wearing the Slumbering Dragoncrest Ring will help in avoiding confrontation with the Giant Skeletons at the back of the cavern. He can easily be strafed behind for free hits, resulting in large amounts of damage \u2013 especially if attacking him with fire weapons or pyromancies (as he is weak to fire).Boss information Attacks Slam  Nito slowly raises his weapon, then slams it into the ground. Difficult to block, but can be easily dodged. Also, Nito pauses for a few moments afterwards, leaving him open to attacks.Thrust  Nito thrusts forward with his sword. Can be blocked or dodged.Swing  Nito swings his sword horizontally. Can be blocked or rolled under.Gravelord Greatsword  Only used by Nito when the player is either far away from him, or when they are out of sight range. After a scream, Nito plunges his sword into the ground, where it emerges from underneath the player, causing toxic buildup along with decent damage. It has a similar effect to the Gravelord Sword Dance miracle.Miasma  After pausing to charge the attack, Nito will expel a wave of darkness in all directions, causing Magic damage and Toxic buildup.Death Grip  Nito's hand glows red, whilst also attempting to grab the player. If successful, it deals a great deal of damage to the player.Trivia References Armor  Armor provides resistance and helps determine effectiveness in combat.Great Grey Wolf Sif  Great Grey Wolf Sif is a boss in Dark Souls.Location  Sif can be found in Darkroot Garden behind large, glowing doors, guarding the grave of Artorias the Abysswalker, one of Gwyn's four knights.Artorias of the Abyss  Sif makes an appearance in the Artorias of The Abyss DLC. The player finds the wolf located behind an Illusory Wall after being led about by Alvina in the Chasm of the Abyss. Sif is found protected by a magical barrier, which was created by Artorias using his Greatshield in order to shield the wolf from the corruption of the Abyss. Upon reaching Sif after defeating the Humanity Phantoms, Sif will vanish and leave behind Artorias' shield. Sif can be summoned during the battle against Manus, Father of the Abyss, after being rescued by the player. If\u00a0the Chosen Undead saves Sif in the Chasm of the Abyss before killing Sif in Darkroot Garden, a different cutscene will play before the fight; however, this can only be done if the player places the Lordvessel in the altar through Firelink Shrine, as Artorias' ring is needed to access Kaathe. In the cutscene, Sif will recognize the player as they approach and let out a whimper. The\u00a0protagonist reaches out to pet the wolf, but Sif pulls away and howls mournfully before sadly picking up Artorias' greatsword. The fight will continue as normal after this point.\u00a0Strategies Notes Boss information Attacks Dashing Slice  Like all of Sif's attacks, this can be blocked. If Sif switches the sword to the right side the attack will be followed by a Sword Slam.Spinning Slice  Sif repositions the sword to a straight position, and spins around twice. Causes massive stamina damage if blocked and can kill players if the slices connect. However, if Sif is at low enough health to where it is limping, Sif will only spin the sword once. Can be dodged by backing or rolling away before the attack is unleashed. Sif will pause afterwards, creating an opportunity for attack.Sword Slam  Sif slams the sword into the ground. Powerful, but has no tracking and poor hitbox. This attack is only used as a follow-up to Dashing Slice and Finishing Combo.Evasive Slice  Sif will attempt to slice the player while jumping backwards and away from the player in one motion. Has little to no starting lag. Blocking it won't give the player an opportunity to attack, but will help the player survive.Single Slice  Sif will do a quick chop from side to side. Good tracking and high hitbox. Possible to roll underneath it with good timing. Also does not do much damage to the stamina bar, thus it can be blocked quite easily.Double Slice  Two slashes from side to side. Great tracking, thus very difficult to sidestep. However, the slices can be rolled under and blocked fairly comfortably without the stamina bar being fully drained. If Sif is at the point of limping, the wolf will fall on its side and struggle to get up on attempting the second slice, so use this to your advantage to do some damage.Finishing Combo  Sif will slice twice and then finish with a Sword Slam. The last attack has poor tracking and a small hitbox, so use this as an opportunity to get some hits in.Trivia Footnotes Armor (Dark Souls)  Armor is a type of equipment in Dark Souls.General Information  Armor provides protection against both physical (Regular, Strike, Slash, Thrust) and elemental (Magic, Fire, Lightning) damage, it increases resistance against negative status effects and it can increase Poise (stagger resistance).Upgrading  Like weapons, most armor pieces can be upgraded. Armor can be upgraded to +10 (+5 for those that require Twinkling Titanite); armor cannot be upgraded down other upgrade paths. Upgraded armor yields higher defensive values and elemental resistance, but never alters Poise.Categories of Armor  Armor sets are divided into three categories based on their total weight: Each armor set is divided into four pieces based on the body part protected: Most armor sets are complete, but there are some unique pieces of armor that are not part of a set, and other sets that do not have all four pieces.Undead Burg  The Undead Burg is a location in Dark Souls.\u00a0It is a fortified town surrounded by large walls and watchtowers, filled with hostile undead. It consists of both an upper and lower section. The lower section can be accessed with the Basement Key at the door atop the bridge, opposite the Hellkite Dragon.Adjacent locations Bonfires Characters Upper Undead Burg Lower Undead Burg Enemies Upper Undead Burg Characters Respawning Non-respawning Boss Lower Undead Burg Respawning Boss Items Upper Undead Burg Miscellaneous Rings Upgrade Materials Weapons Lower Undead Burg Armor Keys Miscellaneous Weapons Bugs Drake Sword  The Drake Sword is a straight sword in Dark Souls.Availability  The Drake Sword is obtainable in the Undead Parish. To obtain the sword, the player must deal enough damage to the Hellkite Dragon's tail to sever it, placing the sword in their inventory. One method of doing this is to stand on the right side of the bridge under the drake and shoot its tail with a bow. Depending on the character's Dexterity, this may take many shots or only a few. The tail will respawn, but the sword can only be obtained once per playthrough.Characteristics  The Drake Sword is powerful compared to other weapons found in the very early game, but has no parameter bonuses. Therefore, it will gradually get weaker and weaker in comparison to conventional weapons throughout the game, even when upgraded. Typical players are best served by swapping to a +5 standard weapon as soon as they can afford the upgrade, while it is largely superfluous to skilled players. The damage of this weapon is fixed and only increases when reinforced or buffed by an outside effect. When wielded with both hands, the strong attack unleashes a ranged vertical cleave (similar to a smaller version of the Stormruler from Demon's Souls) at the cost of 30 weapon durability. Frequent use of this technique can quickly break the sword. Like most dragon weapons, the Drake Sword cannot be enchanted. It grants 20 points of Flame and Magic Defense when wielded. This effect remains active when in the off-hand and two handing a weapon in the right. Feeding it to Kingseeker Frampt grants 5,000 souls.Upgrades  Requires: Dragon Scales and 10,000 souls per upgrade.Hellkite Dragon  The Hellkite Dragon, also known as the Red Drake or Bridge Wyvern, is a miniboss in Dark Souls.\u00a0Location  It is located on the bridge leading to the Undead Parish, although it makes a brief appearance when the player first enters the Undead Burg. It guards the bridge until it is killed. If the player avoids it and runs to the bonfire behind it, the hellkite will fly off, returning when trying to cross the bridge again.Lore  The Hellkite Dragon is not a true Dragon, but a Drake. Drakes are seen as underdeveloped imitators of the dragons, but are more likely their distant kin.Strategy Notes Enemy information Attacks Crossing the Burg  As the Red Drake flies towards its perch above the Undead Parish entrance, it breathes fire upon the bridge. Can only be avoided by descending the stairs in the middle of the bridge.Fire Breath  The Red Drake exhales a plume of flame which covers the entire bridge. It can only be avoided by hiding against the walls in the middle of the bridge that face away from the dragon.Forward Stomp  The Red Drake moves forward to crush the player with one of its front feet. Can be dodged by rolling under the Drake. Can also be blocked, but causes heavy stamina drain.Stomp  Similar to the Front Stomp, however, the Red Drake uses this when the player is much closer to it. Affects a small area beneath it. Can be dodged by either rolling to one side, or by rolling away from the Drake.Head Ram  The Red Drake rears its head to one side, and then sweeps it across the width of the bridge. Can be avoided by either rolling into or away from the attack.Tail Whip  Used when the Red Drake is on the bridge and the player is far away, unless the player has already cut off its tail (such as to obtain the Drake Sword). Can be avoided by rolling towards and under the attack.Jumping Flame Dash  The Red Drake hovers in the air, and then dashes towards the player, whilst exhaling flame on the bridge. Can only be avoided by descending the stairs in the middle of the bridge.Trivia References Footnotes Equipment  Equipment are objects that are found throughout Dark Souls. Equipment can include weapons, armor, consumable items, and more, for the Chosen Undead to use. Equipment can be bought from merchants, dropped from enemies, or found as loot on corpses or in chests. Equipment can be fed to Kingseeker Frampt after ringing both Bells of Awakening, which allow players to acquire souls.Ammunition  Ammunition includes arrows and bolts which are used as projectiles with bows and crossbows respectively. They are consumed with each shot, and two of each type can be equipped.Armor  Armor are items that can be equipped on the head, chest, hands, and legs to reduce damage received and to protect against negative status effects, such as Bleed or Curse. Similar to weapons, most armor can be upgraded with titanite to increase their effectiveness.Items  An item is generally a consumable used to heal HP, cure status effects, gain souls, etc. It can also include covenant items, like Sunlight Medals, and offensive items, like Firebombs.Key Items  Key items are items like keys or Smithboxes which can be used to perform useful tasks such as opening doors or maintaining equipment without the need of a smith. The key items known as embers can be given to specific blacksmiths to allow them to ascend weapons. All key items, except the Master Key and Bottomless Box, are lost upon completion of the game and any embers given to blacksmiths must be reacquired upon entering NG+.Magic  Magic includes sorceries, pyromancies, and miracles, and they are cast with catalysts, pyromancy flames, and talismans respectively. In order to use magic, they first need to be attuned at a bonfire. Casts are replenished by resting at a bonfire and multiple copies of the same spell can be attuned to get extra casts.Rings  Rings are ornamental jewelry that are worn on fingers. They generally grant players a passive bonus, usually relating to damage reduction/amplification or movement. A maximum of two can be equipped at any time.Shields  Shields are categorized as weapons in-game and are defensive equipment, usually held in the left hand. Although shields can be used offensively, they are best suited to their primary purpose: blocking and parrying attacks. Shields reduce damage by percentage, the maximum being 100% of damage, and with each attack absorbed, Stamina is depleted. Upgrading a shield will increase its attack rating and in most cases will also increase stability, reducing the amount of Stamina depleted when blocking. Upgrading will usually not improve its damage reduction; the exception being when a shield is ascended down the elemental oriented upgrade paths.Upgrade Materials  Upgrade Materials include\u00a0titanite and Dragon Scales. They can be used at blacksmiths, or with the Armor/Weapon Smithbox at bonfires, to increase the defense value of armor, the attack rating and stability of most shields, and the damage of weapons.Weapons  Weapons are equipment that are used primarily to deal damage to enemies. They can attack in either hand, but with a very limited moveset while wielded in the off-hand, and, depending on the weapon type, can also parry or block when in the off-hand. Although with considerably lower damage reduction when compared to shields, blocking can also be achieved when wielding a weapon with two-hands. Most weapons can be upgraded with materials to increase their damage output. Standard weapons can be ascended down various upgrade paths which can alter their base damage, parameter bonus, and in some cases add an elemental damage type and/or auxiliary effect.Snuggly the Crow  Snuggly the Crow is an invisible NPC in Dark Souls. She is similar to Sparkly the Crow in Demon's Souls, in the way that particular items can be exchanged with her to receive other useful items.Location  Snuggly is located in the Northern Undead Asylum, on a small ridge to the right of the asylum building, right before the cliff where the Chosen Undead is grabbed by the Giant Crow\u00a0and where a larger nest appears after the player returns to the Asylum from Firelink Shrine. Many players get confused about which nest it is. The nest where Snuggly is located is not the same in which the player is dropped. Instead, walking forward about 20 feet toward the asylum and turning left will reveal the trading location. Dropping an item in the wrong nest will cause permanent loss of said item.Exchanges  In order to exchange items with Snuggly, one must drop an item in her nest and wait for her response. If she says \"...No no... that no soft... that no warm...\", she won't accept it. If she does not respond, she will accept it. Successfully completing the trade can be done in many ways. The player can quit and reload, use Homeward Bone or Homeward Miracle, or fall off the ledge and return to the nest (remember to rest at the bonfire in the Asylum first). The item should be in her nest. However, each item trade can only be performed once per playthrough. This is a table of all known trades:Notes Trivia Bugs Shields  Shields are a type of equipment in Dark Souls.Use  Shields are typically equipped on the offhand slot. Pressing L1/LB causes the player character to guard him or herself from incoming damage. Shields absorb damage; although weapons can also absorb damage through blocking, they almost always feature much lower Stability and damage reduction. How much shields absorb are reflected by their statistics. Generally speaking, shields are great at absorbing physical attacks, but poorer at absorbing Fire, Magic, and particularly Lightning damage. L2/LT generates a parry from light and medium shields, or a bash from heavy shields. Shields may be used on the right hand slot as rather ineffectual weapons. There are effective exceptions, though. Most shields from each type can be upgraded down the Standard, Lightning, Magic, Divine and Fire paths. However, no shield can be upgraded down the Raw, Enchanted, Occult, or Chaos paths.Shield Types List of Shields Small Shields Medium Shields Greatshields Humanity (item)  Humanity is a restorative item in Dark Souls. It is also commonly known as solid humanity, to distinguish it from its liquid form.Availability  This item is automatically granted to players and phantoms that defeat certain bosses. It can also be found in various chests and corpses scattered throughout Lordran, dropped from various enemies, and purchased in limited quantities from merchants. Humanity is also obtainable through killing certain characters for solid Humanities, as well as using the Dark Hand strong attack to steal liquid humanity from other players and characters.Drops Corpse locations General information  Consuming a Humanity will trigger a somewhat lengthy animation, restoring the player to full HP, as well as granting players one liquid humanity. It has no effect on status effects such as Bleed or Poison. The Chaos Servant Covenant and the Darkwraith Covenant require the player to use liquid humanity as an offering in order to increase the player's rank within those covenants. Having liquid humanity  also increases item discovery chance (this stops increasing after 10 liquid humanity), as well as defenses (physical, magical, curse resistance, etc.).Overview  Players do not lose solid humanity items upon death. This means that as long as players have Humanity in their inventory, they will not need to worry about running low. Humanity is a popular item in PvP, as Lloyd's Talismans cannot block players from using humanity to heal; additionally, while phantoms cannot use Estus to heal in their hosts' world, they can use Humanity instead. Humanity is not such a popular item for healing in PvE, as it takes longer to heal than Estus and is harder to replenish.Notes ", "Subnautica Wiki": "Subnautica Wiki ", "Bendy and the Ink Machine Wiki": "Bendy and the Ink Machine Wiki ", "Forge of Empires Wiki": "Forge of Empires Wiki ", "Dragon Age Wiki": "Dragon Age Wiki ", "Baldur's Gate Wiki": "Baldur's Gate Wiki ", "Wiki DokkanBattleFR": "Wiki DokkanBattleFR ", "Unturned Bunker Wiki": "Unturned Bunker Wiki ", "Payday Wiki": "Payday Wiki ", "Food Fantasy Wiki": "Food Fantasy Wiki ", "Elder Scrolls": "Elder Scrolls ", "Bee Swarm Simulator Wiki": "Bee Swarm Simulator Wiki ", "Disney Tsum Tsum Wiki": "Disney Tsum Tsum Wiki "}
